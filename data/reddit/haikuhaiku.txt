By that measure, almost everything in life is gambling. Getting out of bed is gambling, because you are weighing probabilities of getting fired if you don't go, and also going on an adventure to the kitchen to make breakfast (the kitchen is quite dangerous).

You seem to disregard the purpose of inflation. Inflation is not an evil. In the right amount, it encourages spending, which grows the economy, which increases your standard of living. The important thing is to keep inflation stable and predictable, then it is helpful. 
Bitcoin is not stable at all, and it is (so far) a deflationary "currency", which means that it discourages spending. Thats exactly what we see. No one wants to spend bitcoin, because they think it will be worth more tomorrow. That's not a good property for a currency. 
Then the volatility just kills any prospect of mass adoption. If you are a business and you need to pay your employees tomorrow, and your savings take a 30% dip overnight, you will need to declare bankruptcy. This is no joke. I've spoken to many businesses who have exactly this worry. I have spoken to businesses who MUST accept bitcoin, because it is their only viable choice, and they HATE it, because it is so unpredictable. They all want to switch over to stable coins. 
Yeah, you can fantasies about a world in which bitcoin is the measure of everything, and that volatility against the dollar wont matter, but that is not our world, and I see no reason why it should ever be our world. 
Bitcoin is digital gold. It's a commodity, not a currency. It is not the future of money. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:46:33
This is ridiculous. You cannot build an economy from this, because it will never get to a place where it is ubiquitous. Not just because you're all just hodling, but also because there is NO reason for merchants to adopt Bitcoin. It's literally gambling for them. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:53:36
Question to HODLers, if you're supposed to never sell no matter what the price, then what use is bitcoin? Honestly, you might as well be collecting rocks. If your philosophy revolves around not letting go, ever, then how can the "glorious bitcoin future" ever happen? You know, "fake" fiat money is actually used. It drives the economy. Some numbers in a digital wallet that you are determined never to let go, don't do anything. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:03:39
Americo-centrism? What are you talking about? I'm from Europe. But the idea that the world would go off the USD standard, and instead choose bitcoin is laughable. A currency that can loose 60% of its value in 3 weeks is never going to be a currency.  
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:01:26
Nonsense. The only people who are "adopting" bitcoin are: 
1) people who are already super into bitcoin 
2) small businesses that want to take advantage of the added bitcoin market. 
smart merchants would never keep their cash reserves in bitcoin, because they risk insolvency, if the market happens to dip 30% the same week they have to pay their employees, or need to fix the pizza oven or something. 
Yes, businesses can adopt bitcoin, but only as a cute new way to attract customers. Even most bitcoin payment processors instantly change bitcoin to fiat currency, because bitcoin is way too risky for merchants to hold. 
@_date: 2019-11-12 06:07:03
Yeah that's correct. Bitcoin is a terrible store of value. It wend down 60% last year, and is up 40% this year. That's atrocious, in terms of storing value.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:53:16
Agreed, a single strategy cannot work consistently. Poker, btw, was recently "solved" by neural networks, I believe, but it was a long road to achieve this. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 00:20:28
But, prices ARE stable. Changes in the value of common goods like apples and eggs and milk only change noticeably if you look at 5 or 10 year time horizons. Other types of goods may increase faster, but that isn't necessarily due to inflation. Rent in cities, for instance, isn't primarily driven by inflation, but by the demand for housing, which is often increasing in major metropolitan areas.   
What I do not really understand is the crypto currency argument. The value of crypto currency is ridiculously unstable. It isn't something that can be used for practical purposes in the economy, unless you think that stablecoins are the way to go.   
Further, I would say that there really is no difference between your two philosophies. We do in fact only "print" as much money as needed. Now it really depends on how you define "needed", and then you have to further justify why you should be the authority on what is needed or not. The fed wants to keep inflation between 1% and 2%, and will create as much money as is needed to hit those targets.
@_date: 2018-06-22 01:09:29
That is kind of like saying "gaming is just a term used to mystify what is really just ones and zeroes." Neural Networks are a distinct category in Machine learning, based roughly on how Neurons work. A better meta-description would be that neural networks are essentially trying to find optimal solutions in multi-dimensional search spaces. 
@_date: 2019-08-09 17:55:34
Really, your business is a fiat business anyway, even if you only take crypto from customers, since you have to convert that crypto into cash to pay your bills to the electric company, your suppliers, your employees, etc. So really, you're just shooting yourself in the foot by incurring a 1-3% conversion penalty, AND minimizing your customer base.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:43:38
Interesting. Ok, yeah, so amongst economists, like 95% of them agree that minimum wage is bad policy. It harms the people it is meant to be helping. Why? Think of a simple case: A fast food restaurant is employing 20 people at like 8 bucks per hour. These people are "low skilled" workers, and highschoolers, etc. These jobs provide some money, and more importantly, skills and experience to the workers, who may then use those learned skills to get better jobs. However, if the government now forces the fast food restaurant to pay 10 bucks an hour, it will have to lay off 4 people. The margins are tight. Small businesses cannot afford to simply pay more. Not only does the minimum wage lead to unemployment and the workers' deprivation of valuable skill acquisition, it also inflates unemployment figures in another way. At 10 bucks an hour, more people would be willing to do that job. But, less jobs are available. This is the basic reasoning behind the argument against minimum wage.
@_date: 2019-08-09 17:50:10
I really don't get some Bitcoiner's obsession with the inflation of the dollar. Nothing about this is a mistake, or a flaw, or a big secret that "they" don't want you to know. It's deliberate, and useful and good for the economy. You want inflation to be low, and stable, but you don't want it to be non-existent, and you certainly don't want deflation. Inflation incentivizes spending, which grows the economy. 
Look at it another way: the dollar has "lost" 90% of its value compared to 100 years ago, but are we poorer? Nope, we are much, much richer on average. In 1929, Real GDP per capita (inflation adjusted to 2012 dollars) was just $9000. Now it is $57,000. That's inflation adjusted, just to hammer that home. So, for the love of God, stop peddling this dollar=shitcoin nonsense, because you are comparing apples to wheelbarrows.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:38:11
I think you are mistaking things here. Trillions of dollars are not sitting in offshore accounts as cash. The vast majority of wealth is not held in cash, but in assets like securities, debt, real estate, machinery, commodities, insurance contracts, etc. 
Holding a security, or real estate, or any such asset IS equivalent to investment in the economy, because that money is working within the system. 
However, the big tech companies like google and facebook DO hoard cash like crazy. I think Google holds 50 billion dollars in cash. This is bad, since they are essentially sucking money from the economy without putting it back in. This is a worrying trend with tech companies. Amazon on the other hand, reinvests in itself and other companies, and is thus more stimulating for the industry. But this is getting into the details.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:40:26
Yeah, the real problem isn't inflation, but the stagnation of wages compared to inflation. This is worrying. 
However, minimum wage is not the answer, since it is pretty much universally considered a terrible idea. It increases unemployment and hurts the low-skill labour market. But that is a whole other topic.
@_date: 2019-08-03 04:11:46
That is selling them.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:52:11
Wait, are you saying that the world bank is the fed? Because those are two completely different things.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:05:06
But again, no inflation would discourage spending and investment, which are good for the economy, which is good for everyone.   
Another argument that I do not agree with is the volume argument. The idea that the price of bitcoin, or some other crypto will stabilize, once there is enough volume, is not really true I think. Look at gold. It has enormous volume. About $300 billion per day. That's at least 10-30 times the size of Bitcoin, even assuming that Bitcoin volumes aren't inflated. Nobody would argue that gold is anywhere near stable enough to be a functioning currency.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:57:33
Ok, I'm not sure you fully understand how the Fed actually increases or decreases the money supply. You seem to think that the fed just prints money and then gives it to the banks and the banks just spend it however they want, thus depriving the normal working man of purchasing power. It's a bit more complicated than that.   
The two main ways in which the fed increases and decreases the money supply is by issuing debt, buying back debt, and setting interest rates, and over-night rates. There are also some other ways, but this is getting more technical. For instance, one can also change capital controls like the percentage of collateral the banks need to hold.   
Money enters the economy mainly through banks, who lend money to businesses and individuals (mortgages, etc). If interest rates are high, debt is expensive, and the money supply tends to shrink. Also, the fed can issue more debt, and then "burn" the money they take in when selling that debt to investors, funds, and other countries (like China, which holds trillions of dollars in US debt).   
The fed only has one job, really: keep inflation in check. And by God they are doing a fantastic job. Compared to any other fiat currency in the world, the US dollar is by far the most stable and inflation-secure. And, as I've pointed out in my original comment, the average wealth of Americans has more than quintupled in the last 90 years, in REAL terms (inflation adjusted). This could not be possible without the great job the fed is doing at keeping the money from loosing its value too quickly, or too slowly. But, it seems you just want to be mad at the "RICH!", instead of actually learning how things work. Thousands of economists have devoted their lives to the study of monetary policy. It is very complex and should not be summed up and judged by some random redditor who is angry at his own financial shortcomings.

@_date: 2019-08-14 19:50:49
I highly recommend reading [this]( short article on inflation. Particularly this point is relevant: The supply of money can never exceed the demand for money:   


The government cannot just "print" more money, it can only supply money in accordance with its demand, which is highly related to GDP growth. Thus, one can restate the situation. It is not the government that causes inflation, it is GDP growth itself that increases the demand for money.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:51:24
Honestly, I think even cryptocurrency is a misnomer. It's Digital Assets, or Digital Commodities. Currencies can be a subtype of assets. The truly unique innovation is that we can create something scarce in the digital world, and that we can decentralize trust. Currency is merely the most obvious implementation of that. 
I agree that "blockchain" hype gets annoying, but its still a better word than cryptocurrency.

... no, its lost. evaporated. When people sell stocks, the price of those stocks moves down. Which means that the market cap of that stock goes down. Which means that that wealth is lost. 
Now, market cap might not be the best measure of wealth, but in the stock market it is much more reliable than in bitcoin, because there are big market makers and less price slippage.

@_date: 2018-02-06 16:32:58
yes money evaporates. Here's why: 
A stock goes up or down based on how many people are buying and selling. If more are selling, the price goes down, if more are buying, the price goes up. 
Let's say I buy a stock at $95. Then, there is some bad news about the company and everyone starts selling that stock. So the price plummets. However, I missed the boat on this cause I was on vacation, and suddenly I look at my portfolio and that same stock is now worth $75. I lost $20. That value is gone. 
This is because stocks are fungible. That is, the particular stock you bought doesn't care about what price you got it at, it will still behave like all the other stocks of that company, which means that you stand to lose a lot of money, if other people decide that the company is doing poorly. 
This month, the stock market lost about $1 tillion in wealth, because of a sell off. That wealth is lost, not in the hands of someone else. gone.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:52:54
I still don't understand how you could have bought anything with USD? They really only accept BCH. I've heard them accepting cash for bulk orders that are very valuable, and only when they already know the buyer. Do you mind enlightening us? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:08:02
ok, now you are being deliberately pedantic. And still wrong. 
You are being pedantic because you insist on equating "wealth" and "money", when they are in fact intimately linked, but seperate. While it is true that buying stocks separates you from your money, you have not parted with your wealth. You have merely transferred it into a different type of asset in exchange for cash. 
Thus, if the price of that stock falls, your wealth diminishes, based on the actions of completely unrelated people. 
Market cap is a somewhat controversial measure of wealth, because of a phenomenon called price slippage. This is particularly true in small, low volume markets. That is, if I had 5000 bitcoin, and decided to cash in, I would end up with much less money than what those 5000 bitcoin were worth on paper. This is because while selling those coins, the price of bitcoin would slip downwards. The 5000th bitcoin I sold, might only be worth half of what the 1st bitcoin was. 
However, in larger markets, like the stock market, where liquidity is provided not only by buyers and sellers, but also by market makers, this phenomenon is less pronounced. 
To sum up: While the amount of cash in circulation remains relatively constant, the amount of wealth in the system changes depending on economic trends. And that is why it is entirely correct to say that wealth was lost in a stock market crash.

Sooo... Buy bitcoin and completely forget about them until you're reminded by your son is now a recommended investment strategy. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:07:56
I can only say what I learned in my economics classes, so i may be mistaken of course. As far as I know, inflation is the rise in prices. Expansion of the money supply leads to inflation, but is not inflation in itself. 
Here is the problem with your thinking: You view bitcoin as both an investment and a currency. A currency is not supposed to be an investment, because this messes up all incentives. A currency ought to be boring, and stable, and useful. You need it in every day life. 
From a small business point of view, this point can be illustrated very well: I need to pay my employees every month, on a given day. I need to pay bills and buy new goods and equipment. I cannot possibly plan ahead if my cash flows and balance sheet are subject to market volatility. If Bitcoin dips 10% the day before I have to pay my workers, I may have to declare bankruptcy, because margins are tight. An economy built on a hugely volatile currency cannot function. 
It doesn't matter whether you think bitcoin will be worth more in 20 years. Totally irrelevant. I also think Real Estate will be worth more in 20 years. Should I take my salary in Real Estate (if that were possible)? No. That would be stupid. 
Similarly, consumer spending is messed up. If everyone thinks they will be rich in the future because Bitcoin will increase in value, why would anyone spend anything? In fact, this very community has exemplified this attitude: HODL! Yet at the same time people are saying Bitcoin will replace fiat money. It is simply a contradiction. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:40:17
Where am I assuming that? It seems you are the one making assumptions.
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:30:14
Honestly it just sounds like Ron Paul doesn't understand Bitcoin at all and just polled well with crypto people or something, so now he's in favour of them. Bitcoin isn't commodity backed, for one.   
Further, am I crazy, or has the USD been a million times more stable than Bitcoin, thanks to the FED? They are doing a pretty good job. Who cares about boom and bust cycles (something that arguably existed even when the US was on the gold standard)? If the economy increases and shrinks in size every once in a while, that's not the end of the world. If the value of money changes 30% per day, that will destroy the world.   
Essentially, this entire year has been "hyper-inflation" for Bitcoin, as its value dropped more than 60%. I think the FED is doing a pretty good job in that department, comparatively. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:52:34
I didn't say there CAN'T be a model that accurately tells us what the price of Bitcoin ought to be. I said that there isn't one. You pulled all of those numbers out of your a\*\* (mind my french). I can do the same thing for any financial instrument. Let's just assume that 30% of the world population put 10% of their wealth in Amazon stocks, or gold, or shoelaces. It is totally irrelevant to the point I was making.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:55:06
I also don't understand the prince stability emergence theory. Look at commodities that have been around for hundreds of years and have huge markets. Gold, Copper, Pork Bellies, Lumber... none of those are price stable in the least. What reason do you have to assume that Bitcoin will become more stable? I'm asking empirically, not theoretically.
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:53:46
correct, but there is also no reason why it can't break the trend and go back down to 3k. This is wishful thinking.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:01:52
I never understood the "correction" argument. There is nothing to be corrected for. If a company is overvalued, a correction can happen, as the price falls to a level that adequately expresses the value of the company, in accordance to generally accepted principles. In Bitcoin, there is nothing there to correct towards. It's just market sentiment. How is a $3000 price more "correct" than a $15000 price? As far as I know, there is no model that accurately tells us what the price of bitcoin ought to be.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:49:01
I hate to tell you this, but inflation is not the act of printing money, or increasing the money supply. Inflation is the rise in prices of goods in the economy relative to the currency. So yes, the value of a currency (like Bitcoin, for instance) going down significantly, is equivalent to the price of goods rising relative to it, which we can call inflation. Read a basic economics textbook.   
I know that Bitcoin fanboys don't like the Fed, but if you look at it objectively, the Fed has done an amazing job at keeping prices stable, and inflation in check. Yes, a certain amount of inflation is desired such that consumer spending is encouraged. However, you don't want too much inflation, because that will discourage saving. You need a balance. So, 96% loss in value over 100 years is not a flaw. It's a feature. That's why you don't keep your savings in dollars, but in assets that appreciate in value.   
The most important thing for an economy is stability, and predicability. Both are NOT features of Bitcoin, but they ARE features of the USD and the Fed (to a reasonable extent, at least).    
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:03:55
The problem is that no one prices anything in Bitcoin. Why should that change? 
No one prices anything in Bitcoin because it is volatile, and you're saying it can only become stable once people price things in Bitcoin. So, in other words, forget about it. 
We can theorize about a world in which Bitcoin is a universal currency, and has the liquidity and market depth of the US dollar today, and we can somehow figure out how it would work. However, if there is no path that get's us there, it's pointless. 
Another thing: loans. No one will give you a loan priced in Bitcoin, because no one is that stupid. But loans and mortgages are a huge part of any economy. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:11:54
yeah that's an interesting point, but I think that the Fed probably plays a bigger role. If we look at other markets that have high liquidity and depth, they are still not as stable. The gold market is the perfect example. It is huge, but gold still lost 30% in one year (in 2013, I believe. Haven't been following gold for a while). 
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:51:13
First you say that economics is all theory (which isn't really true, since more and more it becoming an empirical science), then you say that its not smart to look at theory in isolation, especially theory from 1930. Then you say Bitcoiners believe in Hayek's theory (which is also from the 1930s)...   
In any case, you have not addressed any of my arguments. Is it not true that businesses have to pay their bills on time, and have tight margins, and can therefore not afford a money that is as volatile as Bitcoin? Please address this issue, since it is at the crux of this discussion.   
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:00:23
Ok, I'll explain in more detail:   
Yes, there is a degree to which stock prices are sentiment driven, especially on a daily basis. However, thanks to the underlying metrics of the company (assets, debt, equity, earnings, revenues, profits, losses, etc.) we can make pretty definitive statements about whether a company is over-valued or under-valued, over a given time frame. I don't know how much of the variance in price is explained by the underlying company performance, but probably about 80-90%. That is, if a company's expected value based on it's metrics is $50, but the stock is trading for $300, we can claim with very high certainty that the stock is over-valued, and we should expect a correction in price. Of course, these statements are all probabilistic.   
However, Bitcoin is not like this. There are underlying metrics that you can attempt to use to predict the "correct" price, such as number of users, number of wallets, number of transactions, etc. BUT, there is no good model or consensus on how much of the price variability is due to these solid factors, and how much is due to market sentiment alone. If I were to guess, I'd say that less that 20% of the price is determined by actual network metrics. That is, the difference between a $3000 Bitcoin price, and a $8000 Bitcoin price is literally "I dunno, I guess the 'market' is starting to feel more confident again".
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:53:09
I mean, he's not wrong...
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:43:16
Yes, that is an incredibly stupid argument on your side there. Agreed. How unhelpful is it to say that Bitcoin should have a certain price, but we have no idea what it ought to be. lol. That's like saying "we have no idea whether there are aliens, but that doesn't mean there aren't aliens". Yeah no shit, Sherlock.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:06:12
I'm stunned at how you literally must have read none of my comment, and yet feel the confidence to comment yourself. Dude...
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:45:22
I said "generally accepted principles" didn't I? There simply exist certain correlations between P/E ratios, debt to equity ratios, revenues streams, etc, and stock prices. The market can still be irrational, but that's why we can have "corrections". In Bitcoin, the term "corrections" makes no sense. That was my point.
