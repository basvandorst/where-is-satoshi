All I said was I had a bad feeling about the sudden decrease. That ok with you, officer? I’ll be overjoyed if it continues to rise in price.

I’m worried this time. I’ve been in crypto since 2015. I’ve seen a lot of spikes and drops in price. But for some reason this time just seems odd to me, like something shitty is going to happen. I’ll never sell, people who sell now (out of fear, not necessity) are retarded and deserve to take the loss. I hope I’m wrong though. I still feel like 2020 is going to be a great year for crypto, but these last few months of having a mini bull run and then this recent drop have me nervous.

Right? Like deep down you just know that if you sell it’ll raise exponentially in the coming years, and for the rest of your life you’ll just be riddled with regret from it

Nah, give me the gains. I’ve been accumulating for 2 years now, so I’m dying for the next major bull run.

I think that’s the point

Yeah, get NEO out of there. That’s just insulting putting it in the same tier as Tron

But all of their confusion and lack of knowledge all stems to one thing: usability. Once a painfully easy user interface gets created that makes transactions and sending money easy, there will be such a giant increase in adoption. Like if the general public saw cryptocurrency as basically a “virtual gift card” that they can send to people for gifts/favors that they can save or spend anywhere, crypto is going to moon like crazy.

I don’t know about your family or friends, but most people I know give gifts cards rather than just cash as holiday or bday gifts. Giving someone cash is cold and thoughtless, but if they see bitcoin as a virtual gift card it adds a sense of novelty that people eat up. Virtual gift card might not be a good example, but I know for a fact crypto isn’t going to get adopted the way it is. There has to be a gateway into the public that makes it enticing and easy to use.
