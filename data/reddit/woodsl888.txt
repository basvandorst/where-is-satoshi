Thanks for that I have set my Coinbase account up looks a good site, so I basically just send my coins to my Coinbase wallet then sell when I like? And it's safe sending to my bank no questions should be asked if its in smaller amounts?

Haha I'm not the stupid, the details I have stated are inaccurate

Fucked over in what part of the process? The buyer has a very high reputation and it will be through an escrow system. I'm worried about what the bank are going to say about a large amount of money incoming and I have to say I've sold a car

I understand your concern about the scam but would this still be a worry with someone who has over 500btc volume 5500 trades with over 1000 different people and all 100% positive feedback?

If a well known trader transfers me around £50,000 from he's business account into my Natwest current account to purchase bitcoins from me will Natwest question it?

How can it be reversed I thought once a bank transfer clears then it's yours?  
Can you tell me what I would be asking for as proof? Like a screenshot of the money into my bank account details? 
The buyer has huge rep in the UK he's been around for years with all positive, but yes to be safe I will ask for all those details to be safe. 
If something happened and I was contacted by the bank what's the best thing for me to say about where the payment has came from?
