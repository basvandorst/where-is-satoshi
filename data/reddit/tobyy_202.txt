Firstly, thank you very much you have been a great help explaining that first bit about Coinifys transaction not confirming yet which is why it's not come through yet. Now I'm sorry if I sound totally retarded here but how do I get the private key for  1D6PnvYuUhybTZDnQTrSgsGWaqBEfYjD7W  because I don't have an account with coinify they just acted as a middle man so I cant log into a coinify account to see that transaction if you get me?

Tweeted him this, lets see how he responds....  [~~ Hi Peter, just a quick question for you. over 24 hours ago, I sent this transaction [ …]( and used the "priority" fee calculator that is STATED to take 1-60 minutes for the transaction to confirm. Can you please explain why it's been over 24 hours?

What's an RBF and how do I do it? I sent all the funds from my wallet so can I still do an RBF?

Ok thankyou I will do my best. If I have to wait it out how long could it take for me to receive it because counbase says I need 6 transactions before I can use it?

I didn't convert £98 GBP to BTC. What happened was I first tried to sell them bitcoin from my blockchain wallet using their provider Coinify. This didn't work and after waiting a week Coinify refunded me the BTC to my blockchain wallet. Once I received the bitcoin refund from Coinify I then tried to send it to my Coinbase account so I could exchange the BTC to GBP and withdraw it to my bank account. But it just hasn't confirmed
