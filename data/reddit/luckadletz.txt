It's a relatively new currency and you expected fluctuations.

Oh cool, [Monstercat!]( I love the stuff you have on there. The thing with buying just a song or two from a new site means I gotta pull out my credit card or go through paypal or all that crap. It'd be way easier for me personally to just copy/paste an address without getting off my butt and taking off my headphones. And I'd know that the artist and you guys are getting a bigger share without the credit card companies ruining everything.
Add bitcoin and you got a sale from me.

All the links posted are clearly just ad sites, not referral schemes. Just check the urls.

While $100 is a great milestone, and I'm sure tips are great publicity and lots of people would like it, it seems a bit spammy and off-putting to blatantly campaign like this. 
If you guys are set on this though, I'd check with the mods of each sub beforehand for permission and try to make your contests as relevant and interesting as possible.
Regardless, good luck. I know I'd personally jump through a hoop or two for a bitcoin buck, even if its just to turn around and tip it again.
