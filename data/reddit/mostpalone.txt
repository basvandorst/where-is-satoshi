Solid counter argument. Have a good day!

Why so? I think that's quite unfair for the site owner/author. It's not like they were forcing Ledger on our throats. It's just a small image on the sidebar and some Ledger/Trezor referral links on the hardware wallet section(which is fitting anyway).

 Well to be fair, the content is good, and a Ledger sponsor fits well to the topic anyway. I really don't see anything wrong with it as it's a legitimate product anyway. I'd rather see articles promote Ledger/Trezor than some investment scheme.

So everyone with a different opinion is a scammer now?

Alright. Double checked the links in there. The Electrum wallet was only linked once, while the Ledger was linked twice. While the author was definitely suggesting the Ledger a bit more, it's not that bad. Honestly if a dude was asking me about wallets I would suggest a Ledger/Trezor too.


While I haven't really heard of this, I assume that the 15 year old had access to the physical device, right? If so, it's not as bad as you're describing it.

Oh. That definitely makes a lot more sense. But for every buyer, there should be a seller. Right? And vice versa. Because transactions are instant(correct me if I'm wrong).

Assuming you can accurately predict the ATH and ATL.

I think we're up to something here..

Well, to be honest if I invested a huge amount of money in to bitcoin, then I would say the same thing too.

Theoretically you can. It's just that it's illegal.

Samourai is a great wallet. This is very unfortunate and childish of him.

Best of luck! Prioritize security, always.
