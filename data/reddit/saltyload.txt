I have never bought bitcoin to “invest”. I always spend it the day I buy it. I like using it like money

Mixing coins does not work. It was a scam. Have you ever heard of a buyer getting busted for not mixing their coins? Fuck no. Because it doesn’t happen. You can run your coins through a mixer but they can still be traced back to you. It’s a joke

You just told me false information. The creator of silk road did not get busted for not mixing his coins! Lol! 
   Please show me your source. I would love to see it. Thanks
