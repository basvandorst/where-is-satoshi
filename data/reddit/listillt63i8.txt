Ok so I'm going to be figuring some of this out as we go. 
First: You have a ledger and in August of 2017 you had BTC on it, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:52:19
Alright I'm at my computer. Still looking for help?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:23:15
What's the issue with coinmarketcap? Seems pretty handy to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:45:22
Brainwashed people? Because they pay taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:36:42
Every coin ever is and always will be stored on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:42:24
Just because you don't plan on paying your taxes doesn't mean everyone else shouldn't. It certainly doesn't make people asking questions for tip on paying their legally required taxes 'agents'.

Go to your exchange account, find where it let's you deposit btc to your wallet there. Send to that address (if it's your first time send I'd send a small portion first, just so you're comfortable with it getting there).
From there you can find the sell. You'll probably have to identify your identity (took around five minutes and three pictures on coinbase).
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:00:51
Lol it does this sometimes. Just enjoy the ride 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:01:50
I can't stop reading them. Shit, we've came a long way. I can't wait to read the 9k thread in the same way. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:19:17
Nah just don't consider it good long term storage. Take it out after work 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:31:12
Why not a paper wallet? Get it off the computer all together. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:45:57
Because we've all asked ourselves that at every major milestone on the way up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:08:12
You'll pay a fee to transfer between wallets but the amount depends on how much you transfer. A few bucks. Google bitcoin transaction fees.
I'm sure a Google could give you a good comparison of exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:54:53
Us? Wrong? No.. No we could never do that 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:19:10
Nah that's a core part of bitcoin. It's a miner fee, it doesn't matter what type of wallet you're transferring to. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:41
(Don't actually do this people) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:50:38
Ah well shit it looks like they aren't taking GBP right now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:36:37
Congrats! Enjoy your profits, maybe we'll catch you again down the road 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:17:53
The rule of thumb I saw way back that pushed me to buy a hardware wallet was that if it was 10% or less of your holdings you should buy one. A $150 hardware wallet being worthwhile for $1500 in holdings for example.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:14
He'd have some bcash too yeah? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:49:12
This is the 0H/1H/2H thinng yeah guys?
OP if no one better shows up I can help in a couple hours when I'm home. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:51:55
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:12:10
Oh how wrong we've been
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:46:25
Right now gdax shows that it'd take around 300 btc to fill the orders down to $9700 from $9850. There's no real answer to your question but this may at least give you an idea of quantity 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:39:26
The coins would be inaccessible. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:55
I'll take a downswing any day, make the huge upswings even more fun 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:37:34
Give it some time. There's a ton of traffic right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:26:16
Yeah I was pure mycelium for quite a long time before pulling the trigger on one, a song as you keep your back up info safe it should be just fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:05:41
Only buy what you can afford to lose. No, bad move.
But hey, it's worked for others 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:34:46
It's fine I'll message you 12/21
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:14:19
Have you sent USD to your coinbase USD wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:41:04
Likely their issues. Op go to bitcoin - settings - browser - off
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:02:56
Coinami has a lot of alts. Note that it's one app, you can't have one wallet for different coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:50
I'd imagine there will be a backup feature within (I've always used mycelium for a mobile wallet though).
You'll write down 12 or so words, if you lose your phone download the app again and tell it to restore from backup. You'll input those words and be good. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:31:58
Hardware wallet? Ledger Nano S or TREZOR.
I use the nano s, absolutely love it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:40
They'd transfer btc back to you? Like any other fiat transaction.
What if a store manager steals cash?
Btc isn't anonymous anyways, the transactions could be traced. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:43:31
To steal bitcoin they have to have a private key. Every transaction in to and out of a btc wallet is recorded.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:28:45
Ah that's bad ass. I never realized that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:23:09
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:45
Coinbase is pretty popular. Watch a YouTube or four on it.
To get started right away: coinbase.com or app, create an account. Link your bank account for a lower fee or use a credit card. Buy btc.
Don't consider coinbase as good storage. Look in to creating a wallet. Watch YouTubes. Mobile wallets will do if you aren't huge in to it (I've mycelium). 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:24:19
Yeah those are the funds it's looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:31:02
Let us consult our magic fucking ball and all become rich 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:43:24
I'd think it'd be the same ish? 
From the coinbase homepage: Accounts, and under your LTC wallet there should be a USD wallet (or whatever in UK?). There's a deposit button under it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:53:48
Yeah someone more familiar lurking around will though. I'm pretty sure that's going to be it.. I went through the same thing from a different wallet a few weeks ago 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:15
A few hours wouldn't concern me at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:01:53
One method is a wallet with USD on coinbase, buying and selling on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:27:49
Million dollar pizza? He wishes.. It was 10k btc. 100 million.. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:51
Bitcoin isn't ready for widespread utility yet anyways, seems fine to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:41
Yeah, once you're verified you can create a USD wallet on coinbase and then use gdax.com to buy and sell and avoid their fees 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:17:50
Trade car for cash and buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:30:05
I'm sure it's just fine, just don't leave your coins on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:16:28
Easiest would be to set up wallets for them and use shapeshift or changelly to convert btc to whichever you're interested in. You can also use exchanges like bittrex though 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:53:41
Yeah for sure, enjoy the ride 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:35
Nah you'll want an actual wallet - don't store on coinbase long term.
I use a hardware wallet as do many here with any decent amount of coin. Look up the Ledger Nano S or TREZOR wallets if you're interested.
I use mycelium (app) for a small portion that I like having readily available. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:21
Yeah sounds like they're way slow. With a bank account you have to wait a week for it to clear, so instant is more so relative here I'm thinking 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:10
Bahaha go balls deep if you want but don't recommend others follow 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:40:16
Crypto is definitely not for someone looking for stability at this time. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:32:37
I told myself it had peaked since $1,000. I backed out several times. At $5,500 I went through the same thought process, but said fuck it if I lose I lose. I've had a regular monthly deposit into BTC since then and it's paid off huge. I'll be doing the same the 15th of this month regardless of price. 
No, it isn't too late. Don't put more in than you can lose but BUY IN. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:26:27
I mean I didn't know anything about it when I first bought in.. It was touted as the 'currency of the future' yada yada. No reason not to buy in and learn later. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:04
Huge exchanges pay millions for top of the line security, put it somewhere like Bitfinex and let them do the legwork 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:53:07
You're on which is the largest btc circle jerk there is (no offense guys) so you're going to get some bias.
That being said we've all asked ourselves that landmark after landmark. Those that finally bit the bullet and bought saw it pay off.
Don't put more in than you can lose, but buy in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:29:26
The fact that we're looking for 5k increments to get excited it's pretty sweet. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:34:10
All good! I'm just hanging around here answering questions anyways.
If you're verified in coinbase (maybe had to be the second id verification) you'll have that USD wallet option. Go to it and you'll have a deposit option. There is no fee for this, and no fee when you use this money on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:55
I wish I hadn't waited for the price to drop. Kept watching it rise and eventually committed to a monthly buy in regardless of price. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:10
I use the same email. Don't see an issue with it if you don't leave coins on them.
Each exchange has its unique address/wallet to deposit to, yeah.
And yep, you'll just sent them all to your mycelium wallet. Make sure your wallet is for the right coin if you do get in to alt's. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:20:43
Back when I did my research it was what I settled on but that was quite a while ago. All I can say is I never had an issue (and went through two broken/lost phones) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:17:51
Have you verified your account on coinbase? Once you do you'll see a USD wallet pop up. Fund that wallet in the same way you'd buy bitcoin and that's the funds you use to buy btc 
@_date: 2016-09-05 17:35:26
I use Circle on Android and haven't needed my ID 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:09:51
This is ridiculous lol 
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:16:00
But it's a 33% drop, which makes way more sense in this context 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:28:54
$1000 is 33% below us
