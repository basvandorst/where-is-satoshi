There is no such thing as "speculative value" - there is just the value and the price reflects the value people put on the network - that value being its usability (of which user base is one part). Money is Money, im not sure why you think and investors dollar holds less weight than a users dollar.

Coinbases vault option is more secure than cold storage if you don't know what you are doing. People using cold storage have been hacked, due to using sites that use bad RNG to make the wallet or otherwise expose the key on accident.

I dont think you actually understand the future of Bitcoin. It's like saying "The internet will never be big, the fastest speed we have is 56K!". There are unlimited possibilities and applications for the BTC network. Will it be as big as FB? i dont know, no one does. but COULD it be? yes, absolutely and if you dont think so it means you don't understand just how revolutionary it is.
If in 1980's you told people the internet would revolutionize commerce, people would have laughed at you. Most people using in the internet would have told you you were crazy for giving someone your CC over the internet and "An online store making more than big box retail outlets? Youre fucking insane!" But here we are. 
Youre comparing BTC in its infancy to FB in its prime.

He has made BTC accessible to many thousands of people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:03
no...but that has nothing to do with the argument being made....you need to re-read the comments.... you totally missed the point.
The issue at hand is, does the Market cap of amazon preclude the stock price from hitting any given number?
To put it even more simply, do you think this is a valid argument:
Amazons stock price can never rise to X, because then its market cap would be too big.
The answer is no because this is a totally nonsensical argument and is a misunderstanding of what the market cap metric is measuring and how it applies to real life.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:22
I mean, i think youre thinking about market cap incorrectly. Even if BTC was $15M it doesnt actually mean everyone would be able to get $15M for their BTC and it doesnt "make BTC worth more than the worlds wealth" because if everyone tried to cash out, the price would go down. 
If BTC's market cap is $100 billion, or $100 trillion it doesnt actually mean $100 billion / trillion of wealth can be extracted from BTC. Its just a representation.
I.E. its not a static number, it changes every time someone buys / sells

There is nothing voluntary about bankrupting yourself to pay for a life saving or necessary procedure or medication. Or getting in an accident and being ambulance'd to the hospital.
according to your logic though, we should abolish taxes altogether? There are certain things that need to be funded through taxes (or confiscating money as you say) its just a reality of life. Healthcare should be one of those things.
pretty much every other developed country except the US has universal healthcare.

Sorry, ill explain. You made a comment that universal health care was funded by taking (too much presumably) money from people. Your comment almost seemed to imply that the alternative (single payer) isnt also funded by taking money from people. My comment was meant to point out that the cost of healthcare is already expensive, so that argument is a non-issue.

Thats not how it would work. You would sell the apt in USD, at the time of closing buyer would transfer seller the market rate of BTC, then the seller would probably convert that to fiat. In all likely hood someone like bitpay would handle the transaction and the seller would never have to hold any BTC if he didnt want to.

The issue is that it wasnt returned to your wallet, it only looked like it was. I assume coinbase must have it set up that if a transaction is taking to long it will try to put the money back in your wallet (obviously), so they credit your account the amount (this is just for display purposes it seems) and then wait for the actual coins to come back. But the first transaction you initiated did get picked up eventually and then they removed the credit and your second attempt at sending as you were inadvertently trying to double spend. 
Now, none of the above is your fault - and your coins were safe the whole time - up until the point you decided to tidy up. You didnt verify where the coins were. seeing xxxx in your coinbase account balance is not verification. so we are left the draw the conclusion you didnt or dont understand what you were doing, which is fine - but dont start moving, touching and deleting things unless you actually know what you are doing and just "feel" like you know what you are doing.

seems unbelievably easy to prove, just crack 1 public key with money in it, that we know doesn't belong to him to begin with.
Even if we were to believe his claims that it is only for some "easy keys" then you are simply talking about the probability of an address collision versus PVKey discovery. Which also extremely low. Like, unimaginably low that one of these "easy public keys" has money in them.

With that logic you should never buy BTC at any price.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:45:02
There is no inherent price. As long as you keep putting more money in your trading account you can short for as long as you want (is my understanding). But since most people don't have infinite money, there is a point at which you can no longer add more money to your account to cover your losses. But that number is different for everyone, even if they opened up a short at the same price.
So if you short at $2 and the price rises to $3, you need to have at least $1+ in your account to cover your losses on your position or it will be liquidated (obviously). But lets say you have $10 in your account. The price could go to $12 and you would still be okay.
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:43:15
? if i bought a $1000 washer/dryer with BTC and the the price went to 0 its irrelevant, you would owe me $1000 USD for the return, not $0. if i so choose i could then go buy more BTC with my $1000. i might end up with more/less BTC, but i would have the same USD. Also what i do with the money after the return is of no consequence to you.

Because then everybody would always claim to be doing some other activity that isnt illegal. I could set up a website that sells 99.9% illegal items and then like...some mundane item. and everyone would say, O YES OFFICER, I WAS HERE FOR THE BANANAS. yeah...okay bro. 
I actually think ALL drugs should be legal. But they arent. Silk Road was a website that sold drugs, if you were there, you were there to buy drugs. if you were buying something other than drugs, then you are kind of an idiot. im sure you could have gotten your BTC stickers somewhere safer.
Although i still cant figure out why anyone would ever deposit funds into a website that sells drugs. why not just keep it in your own wallet? Probably some escrow reason. still, then you should never keep more in the drug wallet than was necessary for immediate purchases.

You refund in USD, not because BTC isnt a currency, but because its not legal tender. If they want BTC, give them the BTC equivalent in USD at the time of the return. They cant compel you to refund them in anything other than USD though since you know...USD is the legal tender of the united states. Can i demand you refund me in chickens or something? no, obviously not. its the same with BTC, i cant make you refund me in BTC. if you owe someone money, you pay them in USD in the united states, or the USD equivalent IF they will take it. But you cant make them, and that applies to you AND the customer. you actually CAN "force" someone to take USD as settlement of a debt. That is the whole point of legal tender.
Just put a big sign up saying "all BTC returns are processed in USD" and be done with it. You still save on CC transaction fees, etc... by accepting BTC.
The more i think about it, the more it does not make sense to even refund people in BTC equivalent because it requires you to keep BTC on hand and that is a whole other set of headaches.

I dont think there's ever any reason to delete an address associated with your coin base wallet. 
Maybe coinbase can restore the wallet for you, who knows.
But if i was having a problem sending BTC to a wallet, i wouldnt just delete it before the issue is resolved. That seems counter productive.

GoX Price pretty divorced from reality, now more than ever. Although i dont trade on GoX, i think a lot people are poised to make a lot of money if they trade there - i think Gox are incompetent, but probably not insolvent.

@_date: 2014-07-02 18:31:12
That's true, but this is still a good addition. Its there to prevent a third party from taking your coins, which lowers the points of failure to coinbase going under (unlikely).

No, thast not how an exchange works. if i have 100,000 coins and the current price of BTC is $500 that does not mean i have $500,000. 
In reality if you dumped 100,000 coins on an exchange what would happen is this:
Your first 200-300 coins get $1000~
Your next 200-300 you get $990~
Your next 100-200 you get $980~
Your next 100-150 you get $970~
and so on and so forth as you eat though all the buy orders  on the way down. by the time you get to your last coin, it would be like $100.
So now youre in a situation where you bought all the coins for a fixed price, but you arent able to sell them for a fixed price.

No, you weren't, that's your whole issue here. Sending BTC doesn't mean its received. When you can go on Blockchain and see that your BTC's are received to a wallet outside Coinbase with a few confirmations THEN you can say "I was then able to send to another address with no issue"
I understand why you would think that, and you are not totally at fault. But you made the biggest and most critical error in this chain of events by deleting the address which is your fault, not coinbase's. This whole situation could have been avoided if you werent touching things you didnt understand. As i mentioned there is NO reason to delete a key pair from your coin base wallet.
All i can say is if it were me, and i tried to send money to my own wallet and it bounced back, then i tried to send it to a different wallet - i wouldn't delete the first wallet until i could verify for CERTAIN where my funds were and that i could access them.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:34:16

Nope, ive been there done that. First of all, you're not dealing with Ebay on a charge back, you're dealing with Paypal.
 
If you've ever dealt with them on a charge back, youre dealing with people who couldn't hit the floor if they fell.
They do not accept any kind of electronic confirmation of delivery and they ONLY accept a tracking a number from a physical package delivery.
Ebay messages are useless, because the person doing the chargeback will say their account was compromised and it wasn't them who sent the messages and paypal will side with them 99% of the time.
You cant prove the coins were sent, because paypal doesn't recognize the blockchain as even existing. 
I would say I recovered about 30% of what I sold because I physically mailed receipts or just straight up blank envelopes  to people to generate a FedEx Tracking number just so I could go these idiots and say, o hey look - it was delivered.

Its not that i think it will go up forever, it will go down and up and down and up as it always does - but there's too much fluctuation in the price, you're so likely to get margin called on a random spike, - even if you get the overall market movement right.

I wonder how much people get paid to make comments like this. to obtain this "edge" you need to break one of the core designs of BTC. and even you concede there is some "edge" (which there isnt). who benefits from this edge?

To be fair, they have been susceptible to fraud and theft because many are not based in the US, are unregulated, uninsured, shoddily coded, and there is no legal recourse for the exchange owner just running off.
Hopefully they will be able to rectify these problems.

You can take the wallet .dat file and import / sweep it using another service. That being said, it sounds like neither of you know what you are doing and are likely to screw something up.  Make sure you back up everything before trying anything. It is possible, but why would he put btc in his ltc wallet. Its way more likely he has ltc in his wallet.  Probably easiest just to update his client.

Coinbase is totally fine, people take it personally when they get flagged by coinbases automatic detection systems. But by and large, its a great site, and great service (i cant speak to customer service, i havent had much dealings with them). Its safe to use and they are not interested in stealing from you, at worst your money would be returned.
As mentioned, Gemini is also fine.

So, i just bought 2016/17 - its very good and very simple. Obviously not that great if you are trading outside exchanges and not recording, but i digress....
Its actually pretty laughable that GDAX/GEMINI dont have this native functionality.
Have you been in touch with them to see if you can sell directly to them?
I dont really mind paying $20/yr but it doesnt seem a little steep for what it does and imagine most people wouldnt pay that much for this- i would think if you priced it closer to something like 1 cent per trade it would be more used by a larger amount of people.
Good stuff though
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:23:40
The more i use this the more i like it, is it possible to have it gather my trades real time continuously rather than having ti import trades to update it? (or does it already do that and i just havent used it long enough to notice?) - I.E. to use it as a portfolio tracker. i have been looking for AGES for something that does your "Portfolio closing report" section well (people keep recommending the Blockfolio app, but its garbage). if you build that section / functionality out it could be a service in its own right. Honestly, I would have bought it just for that.

Yes, by holding BTC.


Its both, not one or the other.


The ability to vote is not a vulnerability, unless you are a hostile minority worried about your position being diluted and not being able to hold everyone hostage.


...you mean like you?


Yeah we should leave it up the garbage collectors, so they can vote to dump it all in the river because its cheaper and pollute the envrimoent for everyone with no regards to its effects on the people they are collecting garbage from.
This is notwithstanding the fact IN REAL LIFE ITS NOT UP TO THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS, ITS UP TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND STATE REGULATORS WHICH IS MADE UP OF REGULAR CITIZENS. the "garbage users". you literally provided a metaphor that PROVES my point.
Gimme a break. You have no business voting on these decisions.
But hey, whipping out that "garbage collector metaphor" really got you the upper hand, how could I ever compete with that. You really have the biggest metaphors. Impressed. Bigly.

On one hand youre saying everyone should have an equal vote and on the other youre saying your vote should be tied to some kind "worth" you provide.
You cant have it both ways. 
In the real world everyone gets to vote, even if you arent a huge mining corpeation, so why do you think the users, who represnet the majority of the btc ecosystem shouldnt get to vote?  
Owning bitcoin, running a node, these  make you a user. Its easy to prove.

its the weekend, calm your tits. jesus. CB is not going anywhere and im sure they have no interest in stealing your $25K.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:54:24
nah it s fine.
You can open a new line of credit with the promotional 1 year 0% APR on balance transfers. (finding it might be a tad tricky, it isnt always available)
Then do said balance transfer to your CC. the thing is on my CC you arent allowed to have more than 2 billing cycles where there is a "surplus" on your account - so after 2 billing cycles they mail you a check for the amount.
So for example i did the 0% balance transfer to my real CC for $100, after 2 billing cycles of having this $100 credit they mail you a check for $100. (i dont know if this varies by CC)
Then i take that $100 check and put it in my checking account and use my checking account to buy the BTC.
***Bonus points i guess if you wire the money to GDAX or Gemini or something versus coinbase to avoid the 1% buyer/seller fee.
Then turn around and just make minimum payments for a year on the promotional 0% APR credit card.
Then when the year is up, you pay back the balance.
So if the minimum was $1 a month, you pay $1 a month for 12 months then $88 at the very end and pocket the difference / appreciation from your BTC.
essentially, you are taking out a 1 year 0% interest loan from the bank.
Does that make sense? i can explain it more.

i probably have a higher risk tolerance than you but i've had good returns at Satoshidice.com and similar website (there are others, SD works for me though). with 1,200 BTC youre looking at conservatively roughly 1BTC per day profit acting as the house (ON AVERAGE - some days its more, some days you lose money, but in the end youll end up positive). Thats $16,000 per month profit roughly, and gets compounded if you dont withdraw it all, easily liveable income.
alternatively, you can just cash out slowly and not trigger anything (illegal of course - unless you live somewhere with no cap gains tax)
I would be careful though, $1.2M is a lot of money, but if youre young it is probably not enough to retire on unless you live very frugally.

Copy Paste:
There are innovations peppered throughout history that have changed human culture beyond recognition. One such innovation was the adoption of agriculture.
Prior to this adoption, the great thinkers within society struggled with how to determine when to break camp and move to more fruitful lands, how to limit the size of a village so that sheer numbers did not quickly deplete the available food in a new area, and how to design lodging so that could be quickly dismantled for a sudden move.
Imagine how these great thinkers must have struggled to comprehend a world in which the village never moved; where the size of the village was inconsequential; and where lodging was constructed of immovable stone. There would be nothing in their contextual understanding of their culture that would allow them to comprehend the end product of the emerging new world.
I believe that the blockchain is, even now, ushering in a new economic and social paradigm that will rival, if not exceed, the impact that agriculture had in human society.
The idea that has clouded the waters for many is the idea of "decentralization." There has been much hype for dozens of years about the mind bending potential of decentralization but little if nothing has come of it. The reason is that no-one has been able to solve the problem of distribution required to power these decentralized system.
Distributed, decentralized systems have an inherent power that literally obsoletes centralized systems. this is obvious even to the most casual observer. We have known this for decades. It was not until the arrival of the blockchain, however, that we had a tool capable of melding "decentralized" and "distributed" into a single unit within which no central authority whatsoever was necessary. The distributed ledger, maintained by no-one, accessible to all and validated by consensus is the tool the world has been waiting for.
Those who understand this tool see immediately the absurdity of words like "bubble," "investment," etc. when applied to cryptocurrencies. These thought leaders use bitcoin to buy and sell and those who use bitcoin exclusively as a currency and use no other currency - and I personally know dozens who do so - could care less about what bitcoin is worth in dollars.
These people see, and have seen for some time, that the old paradigm constructs are meaningless in this new world.
It is like the first pueblo cultures being warned by their past sages that they will perish in their stone houses when it is time for the village to move. They understood that the concept of "moving" had no meaning in their new world.
Likewise, what people see as a bitcoin "bubble," from the perspective of the new paradigm, is merely the predictable and systematic devaluation of fiat currencies that will continue, with obvious ups and downs, until all fiat currencies reach the zero point.
As the relative value of bitcoin temporarily drops, they will point to this as proof if their understanding. It won't matter. The reality if this new world is what it is. Those who understand will be the leaders of this new world.

If you look at technological trends throughout history, this is actually not true (well perhaps not in the way you are stating it). The best technology DOESN'T always win - its actually very hard to usurp an established technological item because it doesn't just need to be better, it needs to be better above some threshold that actually causes people to take action and switch. 
Imagine if say 20 years ago, someone made a 100% objectively *slightly* better VCR player or something like that - would everyone have tossed out their VCR's to buy new ones? unlikely - people didn't start replacing their VCR's until DVD's became widespread.
This same kind of thing plays out all the time.
Whatever replaces bitcoin cant be just a little bit better, its needs to be a LOT better to make people move.

o, wait - you broadcast / moved BCH to a BTC wallet?
In your post you make it seem like you had a BTC paper wallet before the fork and are just asking how to move the BCH associated with that wallet out, that's a totally different issue - which is probably why you were having a difficult time finding help.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:44:40
Its not tied to anything. You send $1 to TeherInc and they send you 1 Tether. its just a USD stand-in.
if there are millions of Tethers being created, that means that someone is sending millions of dollars to tether inc. (presumably).
Unless you think they are just creating them out of thin air, issuing tether without receiving any USD.
Possible, but you should probably have some proof if you are claiming that.

@_date: 2017-11-27 22:05:33
I dont think you understand how stop loss orders work.
Logistically: 
are you suggesting you open a potion and them immediately stop loss at the price you entered? BTC price fluctuates ~$500 regularly. Youre going to get liquidated pretty much instantly. and then what - just do this over and over? losing a small amount of money but quickly over and over adds up fast.
This is not actually how stop loss orders work, if the price tanks hard, you dont get the price you put the stop loss at, you get it at the best price the order engine can fill it as a market order.
So if the price is $10,000 and you put a stop loss at $9,900 but someone sells ~$50,000,000 or whatever huge amount of BTC because they're insane and dont care about slippage (it wouldnt be the first time - see the ETH flash crash), all the sudden the price spikes down to $7,000 instantly. Your position is going to be liquidated at $7,000, not $9,900  - what then?

Yeah, hes MAKING THE CLAIM Tether is insolvent, so the burden of proof is on him to show evidence of that.
Just like if someone came up to you and said "you committed a murder" the burden of proof is on them to show you committed a murder. its not on Bitfinex to prove they DIDNT do something or DONT have something, its on YOU to prove it.
or does every exchange now have to bend to the whims of the reddit hivemind depending on which way the wind is blowing?

They dont need to claim that tether is backed by USD, the default state is that it is unless you have proof otherwise.
Just like you dont need to claim you never killed anyone. The default state is that you didnt, and if someone wants to say you did, they need proof.

This is not an attack on you, but pretty much all of you want is demonstrably (and dangerously) wrong. But i think the most frightening thing is the power of the BU propaganda machine to make people think these things.


Segwit creates bigger blocks, i think the effective block size of segwit is just over or around 2mb.
What you have to understand is, Jihan and Roger DO NOT CARE about bigger blocks. Bigger blocks are just a SIDE EFFECT of what they are trying to push through. What BU wants is to create and implement a system called "emergent consensus" that allows miners to dynamically/on the fly determine block sizes. And as our benevolent miner overlords, Jihan promises these blocks will be bigger than 1MB.
Now, some peoples first thought might be, well okay - whats so bad about that?
Its terrible because what will happen is Jihan will mine blocks that are too large for smaller nodes/miners to maintain and he will use this as a tool to push smaller miners out of the network for a) profit (more market share means more blocks means more money) and b) control - it will make pushing future changes down people's throats much easier.
It will lead to a large amount of centralization. 
Furthermore, Segwit is not incompatible with a HF down the road. Why not just support Segwit now and figure out later if we even need to HF?


It is most certainly not.


I dont really understand this argument, if HF to 2mb is really that important, you can HF the BTC code yourself now and start running it.
What i've seen is peoples opinion extends about as far as their wallet. People claim they want this and that (and not you specifically) but when it comes to actually doing it all the sudden their opinions become very shaky when faced with the reality of financial loss and that maybe what they want isnt logical.


you ABSOLUTELY should. The market cap of BTC is 20 BILLION DOLLARS!...20 BILLION!!!! The human mind cant even comprehend how large that number is. How can you accept poor code safeguarding 20 billion dollars, that's insanity!


I pray everyone does. Please everybody reading this. DO NOT TRUST PEOPLE WHO CANT WRITE CODE WITH $1, let alone $20B.


BU can choose to hardfork at anytime though. If the implementation and idea was good enough to stand on its own, people would switch to it after a HF. but see comment above about opinions, when faced the reality that he will lose money if he HF's, because he knows the sane majority WONT switch to it, he wont do it.


Why? If somehow it ever went through BTC would be so fundamentally different with the emergent consensus mechanism...it wouldnt even be BTC anymore.


This sentiment is entirely divorced from reality. There's $20B on the line, EVERY exploit will be....exploited. Any opportunity for money to be stolen and things to be fucked up will be taken. And it will be done mercilessly, ruthlessly and without guilt or remorse. This is how the real world works. You cant just ask people to stop. You have to plan for the way things are, not the way you want them to be.


Most people support UASF in the sense that they see right through Jihan and Roger and just want a way to bypass them. Most people agree UASF is bad, but are just frustrated that we are being held hostage by one pool.

Mostly that while the PBOC may not be "BTC friendly" they are not "anti-BTC"
There are 3 options to the current situation:
1. All BTC exchanges shut down, and are NOT ALLOWED to re-open.
                   1.5 - They ban them all but then back-peddle at a later date with new regulations.
2. BTC exchanges in China are temporarily shut down, while PBOC enacts new regulations. Once these are set, exchanges will be allowed to re-open as long as they comply with new regulations.
3. same as 2, but are allowed to remain open while new regulations are created.
In order of likelyhood -
2 - we see 3,800 right away with a slow rise - new highs in 90 days
1.5 - we see 2700
1 - we see 2700
3 - we see 4,000 right away with a slow rise - new highs in 60 days
In my opinion, the most likely scenario is 2. No matter how cumbersome the new regulations are - as long as they exist - SOMEONE will get to market. The reward for getting there first is being the only Exchange in China. Thats easily a half Billion dollar a year position to be in with no competition. 
We will see a new top, the question is just "How quickly is PBOC going to come out with new regulations?"
Silver lining is that unregulated Chinese activity was a big reason the ETF was denied in the U.S. 
Perhaps we we are 1 step closer to seeing one now.

Mostly that while the PBOC may not be "BTC friendly" they are not "anti-BTC"
There are 3 options to the current situation:
1. All BTC exchanges shut down, and are NOT ALLOWED to re-open.
                   1.5 - They ban them all but then back-peddle at a later date with new regulations.
2. BTC exchanges in China are temporarily shut down, while PBOC enacts new regulations. Once these are set, exchanges will be allowed to re-open as long as they comply with new regulations.
3. same as 2, but are allowed to remain open while new regulations are created.
In order of likelyhood -
2 - we see 3,800 right away with a slow rise - new highs in 90 days
1.5 - we see 2700
1 - we see 2700
3 - we see 4,000 right away with a slow rise - new highs in 60 days
In my opinion, the most likely scenario is 2. No matter how cumbersome the new regulations are - as long as they exist - SOMEONE will get to market. The reward for getting there first is being the only Exchange in China. Thats easily a half Billion dollar a year position to be in with no competition. 
We will see a new top, the question is just "How quickly is PBOC going to come out with new regulations?"
Silver lining is that unregulated Chinese activity was a big reason the ETF was denied in the U.S. 
Perhaps we we are 1 step closer to seeing one now.

I cant tell you who is "right" but just to give a little context on that sub came about, a (kind of) long time ago there was a big debate about censorship on this sub, the mod of this sub kept banning any discussion of coins that weren't the "original" bitcoin. A good amount of people in this sub disagreed with this stance (i did, and still do, but to a lesser extent).
Someone from this sub thought to themselves, well ill make my own BTC sub with no censorship.
So they did, and thats when rbtc was made.
For a while, it accomplished its stated goal - it was a BTC sub but without censorship.
Now I can't tell you when - but at some point Roger Ver and Jihan Wu saw an opportunity in this sub to co-opt it and push their agenda. (Even before this Roger and Jihan had been trying to make power plays to gain more control of the BTC protocol and maintain what control they did have). I mean the whole scaling debate only exists because Jihan and Roger control a huge amount of mining power and employ a mining technique called "ASIC BOOST" - and wont support any kind of update that makes this type of mining technique obsolete.
There is a wealth of information out there showing that a ton of people who post there are paid by or connected to these 2 guys.
That doesnt make them wrong, but generally if you are right, your product can speak for itself and you dont have to go around essentially spreading paid propaganda to prop up your ideas.

I dont really think this should have any impact on the price. after a couple weeks the difficulty will adjust. If anything, it should increase the price as BTC becomes more scare for a few weeks, then just back to equilibrium.

They won't have anything to say, Gemini didn't initiate the transfer - how could they? Think about how many laws they have to comply with. Multiple 3 letter agencies are trying to figure out if these are the proceeds of a crime before they can be released, this could take months or years. In the end, they might just throw up their hands and confiscate it anyway and then say "prove it isnt drug money". Gemini obviously cant say anything while the police are investigating. Think about how dumb you would have to be to try and initiate a transfer of $1M + in one go. You have no business having that much money anyway with that level of stupid.

Who will buy it? Lots of people.
Lots of people will buy BTC the same way lots of people buy cocaine, or any drug, even if its banned.
Face to face, with cash.

BTC goes up, but it also goes down. Hard. if we were down $53, would you be asking this question?
$53 is nothign when the price is really moving, there have been times where we there are $100 price swings in &lt; 1 hr.

Its behind a login wall, not sure why the 10 other people here didnt already post it in the comments:
The "accidental hero" who halted the global spread of an unprecedented ransomware attack by registering a garbled domain name hidden in the malware has warned the attack could be rebooted.
The ransomware used in Friday's attack wreaked havoc on organizations including FedEx and Telefónica, as well as the UK's National Health Service, where operations were canceled, X-rays, test results, and patient records became unavailable, and phones did not work.
But the spread of the attack was brought to a sudden halt when one UK cybersecurity researcher tweeting as  with the help of Darien Huss from the security firm Proofpoint, found and inadvertently activated a "kill switch" in the malicious software.
The researcher, who identified himself only as MalwareTech, is a 22-year-old from southwest England who works for Kryptos logic, a Los Angeles-based threat-intelligence company.
"I was out having lunch with a friend and got back about 3 p.m. and saw an influx of news articles about the NHS and various UK organizations being hit," he told The Guardian. "I had a bit of a look into that and then I found a sample of the malware behind it, and saw that it was connecting out to a specific domain, which was not registered. So I picked it up not knowing what it did at the time."
The kill switch was hard coded into the malware in case the creator wanted to stop its spread. This involved a very long nonsensical domain name that the malware makes a request to — just as if it were looking up any website — and if the request comes back and shows that the domain is live, the kill switch takes effect and the malware stops spreading. The domain cost $10.69 and was immediately registering thousands of connections every second.
MalwareTech explained that he bought the domain because his company tracks botnets, and by registering these domains they can get an insight into how the botnet is spreading. "The intent was to just monitor the spread and see if we could do anything about it later on. But we actually stopped the spread just by registering the domain," he said. But the following hours were an "emotional rollercoaster."
"Initially someone had reported the wrong way round that we had caused the infection by registering the domain, so I had a mini freakout until I realized it was actually the other way around and we had stopped it," he said.
MalwareTech said he preferred to stay anonymous "because it just doesn't make sense to give out my personal information, obviously we're working against bad guys and they're not going to be happy about this."
He also said he planned to hold on to the URL, and he and colleagues were collecting the IPs and sending them off to law-enforcement agencies so they could notify the infected victims, not all of whom are aware that they have been affected.
'This is not over'
He warned people to patch their systems, adding: "This is not over. The attackers will realize how we stopped it, they'll change the code, and then they'll start again. Enable Windows update, update, and then reboot."
He said he got his first job out of school without any real qualifications, having skipped university to start a tech blog and write software.
"It's always been a hobby to me — I'm self-taught. I ended up getting a job out of my first botnet tracker, which the company I now work for saw and contacted me about, asking if I wanted a job. I've been working there a year and two months now."
But the dark knight of the dark web still lives at home with his parents, which he joked was "so stereotypical." His mum, he said, was aware of what had happened and was excited, but his dad hadn't been home yet. "I'm sure my mother will inform him," he said.
"It's not going to be a lifestyle change — it's just a five-minutes-of-fame sort of thing. It is quite crazy, I've not been able to check into my Twitter feed all day because it's just been going too fast to read. Every time I refresh it it's another 99 notifications."
Proofpoint's Ryan Kalember said the British researcher gets "the accidental hero award of the day." "They didn't realize how much it probably slowed down the spread of this ransomware."
The time that  registered the domain was too late to help Europe and Asia, where many organizations were affected. But it gave people in the US more time to develop immunity to the attack by patching their systems before they were infected, Kalember said.
The kill switch won't help anyone whose computer is already infected with the ransomware, and it's possible that there are other variants of the malware with different kill switches that will continue to spread.
The malware was made available online April 14 through a dump by a group called Shadow Brokers, which claimed last year to have stolen a cache of "cyberweapons" from the National Security Agency.
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's data and then demands payment in exchange for unlocking the data. This attack used a piece of malicious software called "WanaCrypt0r 2.0," or WannaCry, that exploits a vulnerability in Windows. Microsoft released a patch (a software update that fixes the problem) for the flaw in March, but computers that have not installed the security update remain vulnerable.
The ransomware demands users pay $300 worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin to retrieve their files, though it warns that the "payment will be raised" after a certain amount of time. Translations of the ransom message in 28 languages are included. The malware spreads through email.
"This was eminently predictable in lots of ways," Kalember said. "As soon as the Shadow Brokers dump came out everyone [in the security industry] realized that a lot of people wouldn't be able to install a patch, especially if they used an operating system like Windows XP [which many NHS computers still use], for which there is no patch."
Security researchers with Kaspersky Lab have recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries, including the UK, Russia, Ukraine, India, China, Italy, and Egypt. In Spain, major companies including the telecommunications firm Telefónica were infected.
By Friday evening, the ransomware had spread to the US and South America, though Europe and Russia remained the hardest hit, according to the security researchers Malware Hunter Team. The Russian interior ministry says about 1,000 computers had been affected.

TBH, unless you are technically inclined, you aren't going to be able to deeply understand the arguments that matter. Thats not to say you are stupid. The majority of people in the world dont have programming / comp sci degrees with a focus on cryptography, etc...
The vast majority of technical experts (99.99%) are on core's side. Now, that doesn't mean they are right - but unless you are also expert, it probably just makes more sense to go with what the overwhelming majority of very smart people who are able to understand the arguments think.
i.e its a lot more sensical to just look at the price and see what the market is saying. People value BTC roughly 20x more than BCH.
Take from that what you will.

From the very same article linked above:

Not to be a dick, but you didnt lose money because BTC is a risky investment (although it is), you lost money because you made an emotional trade and were a weak hand.

That's probably true, but his point stands. What does the amount of confirmations that any particular person requires have anything to do with bitcoin itself.

im a big BTC proponent, but i dont understand this line of reasoning. if people trust third parties to hold onto their BTC more than themselves, that is a problem with BTC mass usability that needs to be looked into and made easier. Technology is and should be made to fit human needs, not the other way around. 
Its like looking at a car with random parts missing and saying "man, you guys suck, you just need to Lrn2mechanic, its so simple" simple is relative and fuck that, someone needs to just make a complete car.

at points, yes. during the big crash down to like $200 or w.e i think i was down $30,000. It took a lot of will power not to just cut my losses, but the way i thought of it was that between $1000 and $200 - nothing about BTC really changed, so if i thought it was going to be successful before - there wasnt a reason to sell. Glad that i didnt, im up a lot now becasue i pretty much doubled down and bought all the way up until now.
But there were many sleepless and gut-wrenching nights. The anxiety back in the day when the price was swinging +/- $200 every day (or at least it felt like it) was almost not worth it.

Not really, it depends on the level of effort someone is willing to give. If it just sits there never moving, yeah its as good as gone. i guess you could try sell the PK for cash anonymously somehow, but most people wouldnt agree to that.
But if some government really wanted to find them, it could be done. Lets say they sell you the coins, then you sell the coins on an exchange - your infomration could be subpoenaed and they could try and get information from you about how you obtained those funds, and just keep following the trail untill they find someone useful.  
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:54:44

@_date: 2015-11-30 18:36:06
Interesting, but that is by choice that they hold 10% of the BTC on sales, they could hold 0% if the choose to. and $100,000 for a company like overstock doesn't really seem like a lot of money. OP's post makes it seem like they are hemorrhaging money on Crypto, when in reality Crypto makes up less than 1% of the companies assets. 
also, this article was published June 24, 2015 - at the time the price was $243. As of right now we are at $377, so did they "gain $127,000"? 
I would argue in both cases no, they haven't gained or lost anything until they convert to USD. Maybe not for accounting purposes, I don't know.
Interesting they also mention:

I  would think it about the other way.....Why would I pick the $1.....my worst case scenario is i pick the BTC and its worthless and i missed out on $1, which is pretty trivial.
I would think you would almost always want something of indeterminate value over $1, because the chance of any other thing being below $1 in value is almost zero, and even if it is, you havent really lost anything.

@_date: 2019-05-22 16:23:31
Okay, but whats your worst case scenario if you pick the silver bar?
You have a worthless piece of metal, and you lost out on the opportunity for a free chocolate bar.
Whats your best case scenario? you have $150 for doing nothing.
Best case scenario picking chocolate bar: The silver was fake, you have a chocolate bar
So the question is, should you wager a free chocolate bar for the 0.000000....1% chance at $150.
Unless youre starving to death, pretty sure the rational answer is yes, becasue it essentially costs you nothing to take the wager.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:04:30

@_date: 2019-05-22 16:30:05
Yes, mathematically it is. But given the chance, and knowing you could only "play the game" one time - would you take the $1?
I would say its pretty stupid to take the $1, unless you had a really desperate need for the $1.
It would be better to "lose" $1 for the chance to get $100 than to lose the chance at $100 for $1.

If you buy on coin base multiple times with the same card / payment method, you are much lower risk.
OP has a new account, or is buying with a new CC or some new method of payment.
Its all automated though, its not like someone is reviewing each transaction. There is a risk threshold where if you are below, you will be able to withdraw immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:34:20
Dont use MtGox, getting your money out is way to hard. use Bitstamp if you need an exchange and coinbase if you are just looking to buy.

Legal tender is a medium of exchange that *in the eyes of the law* (thats the important bit) will consider a debt settled when it is paid.
Lets say i owe you $10 USD for a good or service. If i give you $10 USD, you MUST accept it as payment, you have no choice - it is legal tender.
you don't HAVE to accept BTC, it is not legal tender. I cant just say, o heres $10 in BTC, see ya later!
If that werent the case then i would just make my own coins called infinity coins and no matter how worthless it is, i could just make as many as i wanted and pay you like that.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:06:47
Yes, coinbase is much more secure than Io. But thats not saying much considering they kept over 4000 BTC in a hot wallet.

The machine does not accept or sell bitcoins.
You go to the machine, put in $10 and the machine spits out a code that represents $10.
You go the operators website and input the code, assuming the code works, the operator then sends you $10 worth of bitcoins.
Likewise, if you want to sell coins, i assume you go to the website and sell your BTC and get a code. you then take that code to the machine and input it and it will spit out money.
The machine only spits out / verifies your code. it doesnt ever touch your BTC.

Sure it does, the moneys coming from somewhere either at the point of entry or point of exit you're leaving a trace - especially if its on an exchange or coinbase or something. if someone with enough access to your finances and life looks hard enough, it wouldn't be that hard to figure out. I dont think its impossible, buts its harder than you think. Also most people arent actually purchasing BTC with anonymity in mind. You practically have to get a rectal exam to use most exchanges.

Yes, make sure you enable Two Factor Authentication - THIS IS IMPORTANT.


The transfer is usually instant, but be aware it takes about 7 days for Coinbase to send you coins (unless you are level 2 verified, then you can buy up to 10 coins instantly per week)


I believe that is correct - Coinbase takes a 1% fee on each side (egregious in my opinion, but it is what it is)

A brain wallet converts a phrase of your choice into a public / private key.
"correct horse battery staple" generates the key:
so now, if i want to access the wallet, i dont have remember this long alphanumeric string. I can just remember "correct horse battery staple" and plug it in to say:  and generate the above private key and access my funds.
People write programs that try common phrases from books / songs / poems / whatever and see if there are any funds in those wallets
Brain wallet is not flawed, people are flawed because they are really bad at picking random phrases. If the phrase you use to generate your wallet address has been written down anywhere ever, it is a bad pass phrase.
In general, if you have to ask "is using a brain wallet a good idea" - dont use a brain wallet.

Paypal ONLY accepts a tracking number for a physical good as proof of goods delivered. I stupidly sold about $1500 of BTC through paypal back when the price was like $200. they of course disputed the charge and when i went to paypal with tons of undeniable proof, (messages through paypal AND ebay) they pretty much just throw up their hands and say they dont care, they need a tracking number. So i mailed all these assholes empty envelopes via fedex so i could get a tracking number, and submitted it to paypal. they sided with me in half the cases and the other half they refunded the thieves. 
But wait it gets better, then they locked my account because it is apparently against the Paypal TOS to sell Bitcoin, so i had to submit to them a notarized affidavit saying i wouldn't sell BTC though them anymore in order to withdraw what funds i was able to recover.
True story. Paypal is a den of fucking evil.

Sell on local bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:14:24
usually you buy something (a BTC) lets say at $10 then you sell it at a later date, lets say for $20. You made $10 profit
But its actually possibly to borrow BTC and sell first. So you borrow the BTC and sell it, lets say for $10. But now the price goes to $20. fuck, you have to buy the bitcoin now and its $10 more expensive then what you sold it for. You lost $10. Conversely, if the price drops, you get buy the bitcoin for cheaper than what you just sold it for. you make the difference in profit.

Your story is kind of confusing. Were you keeping your coins on coinbase without 2FA enabled? was your Multibit password strong? if so, your theory of how they got stolen is probably wrong. inst Multibit a local BTC wallet? your password isnt traveling over any network. maybe Malware?

Well, yes with current hardware you could never break even. lets say you bought $6,000 worth of bitcoins now, that's 43 bitcoins (about). Lets say bitcoin doubles in prices between now and next year, thats $6,000 profit, if it tripled thats $12,040. but if you had a 2 TH mining machine you would make $17,000 just in the first month. Thats assuming you could get it on time though. and i ran the above assuming a 50% increase in difficulty every month.
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:13:37

im pretty sure coinbase buys the BTC when your purchase them...they arent waiting a week and then buying it to send it to you. They buy and hold for a week and then release it to you. This is to prevent fraud. They also cant keep all their BTC in a hot wallet (to prevent massive theft). In times of unexpected high demand, they have run out before.

if you believe BTC will go up, all you have to do is just never make an unprofitable trade and you'll be fine. If the price dips, no matter how bad - you hold. if the price shoots up a lot. Sell 30-50% and buy on the next dip. ive increased my BTC holding 30% by doing it. as long as the price continues to go up, there is 0 risk (if you believe the prise WILL rise longterm) unless you cant control yourself (which most people cant, even though they think they can. Hence these big dips).

that doesnt really make much sense. The total market cap of BTC is insignificant to the US govt. its like a grain of sand in the Sahara desert. but by all means, keep the tinfoil hat on. Plus, if BTC becomes big and the US continues to foster BTC growth in the US, they will make more than enough money in taxes from BTC related companies that i really dont think they would would want or need to kill it.

First of all, stop looking at MtGox, second of all the fall is not "on going" we are at 708 on Bitstamp up from 682.
Thirdly a 10% fall in 3 hours actually is a small amount for Bitcoin, not sure where you have been the past 3 months.

I have never had reason to read the Bitcoin Wiki, my failing was just believing people weren't shitty ass hats. I really wish there was just something more prominent on the pay pal website itself though. For example maybe when sending /recieving money be forced to check a little box to confirm if this is payment for a digital or psychical good. if you check digital it should tell you the payment can be reversed for any or no reason and paypal will make no attempt to protect you.

What neo wrote below is correct. Specifically what is going to happen is this: You buy $200 (~.2 BTC) now and in about 3 days an ACH transfer from your bank for $200 is going to be initiated to coinbase, in another 3 days that transfer is going to clear and .2 BTC will be in your coinbase  account. as to what the USD value that .2 BTC will be worth a week from now is anyones guess.

@_date: 2013-12-14 19:06:03
Because the Martingale betting strategy relies on doubling your bet until you win, i.e increasing the amount of bets you can place. if your start at 1 BTC and lose, your next bet needs to be 2 BTC. If you start at .1 BTC and lose, your next bet only needs to be .2 BTC.

maybe im wrong but think about the crazy margin account you would have to keep open to do this given the recent price surges, even if you were right and KNEW 100% SURE FACT it was all going to come crashing down, you would lose the shirt off your back and have your position forcibly closed before it happened. That being said, i think Coinsetter will support shorting soon if it doesnt already or try Bitfinex.

Thank you, that is the answer i was looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:48:10
i assume its because they dont have the coins in their hot wallet to even be sent right now. The huge demand created a lot of short term liquidity problems for them today - they dont keep all their coins "on hand".

Isn't it backed by bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:53:42
in your above example, bitcoin functions the exact same as cash. If i paid a merchant in bitcoin, and got a receipt - he wouldn't refund me? but he would refund me if i had paid with cash? that make no sense. there's no such thing as a "cash charge back" either. Once the merchant has your cash, he has it just the same as he would have your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:39:10
Yes, obviously. People who get in earlier are taking more risk and for that they earn a higher reward for success. That being said,  there are plenty of people who believe bitcoin will hit 10,000 in the years to come.

coinbase is great, but they are going to charge you $100 in fees to do this. just use local bitcoins in a secure location (highly trafficked bank) or something. At least where i live they usually have a cop inside the bank, so risk of being robbed is minimal.

I should have, I have always operated under the impression that those around me are acting in good faith because i have always dealt in good faith - i wont be anymore and honestly, that sucks because for the rest of my life now im always going to carry this with me and be less trusting of people in general.

I dont know why people keep posting this, i assume it takes into account day trading and people moving money from one wallet to another. I think its great it is going up and is a sign that BTC is becoming more accepted and used (although you wouldnt be able to tell by how much specifically is being used for real transactions).

Because there is no middle ground for a technology like BTC, either it will succeed beyond anyones wildest dream or it will fail spectacularly. Stagnation is the same as failure. Do you leave your house and wonder "hmmm i hope the store im going to will take my dollars?". probably not, a system like that would be pretty useless. if that were the case and would not see any kind of wide spread adoption and people would leave en mass.

Why not use 90-95% for child support now, as suggested, and the rest as speculative investment for the child by going to vegas and playing craps?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:35:02
 the window is extremely small and the reward is next to nothing. If i mine a block worth thousands and thousands of dollars, why would i hold the block back and risk it being orphaned to buy a bunch of crap at wal mart? and that's IF you could even a mine a block by yourself, which requires many thousands of dollars computational power.

@_date: 2013-11-05 06:05:30
right, but isnt there a way to limit what you can access through the API, I.E. not allow it to withdraw coins? I mean, the whole purpose of 2FA is that you need the token to access the account - so any website where you can access the account though the API and bypass the 2FA means you might as well not have 2FA in the first place anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:43
can you show us your trading account screen shot where you have shorted BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:22:16
in reality, most un-tech savy people coins are much safer in coinbase using 2FA than they are on your computer. Your coins are at risk just as much from your own stupidity as they are from hackers.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:48:19

I like coinbase.
It has problems.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:16:19
They claim is is, but at the moment it definitely is not. In fact their bid/ask hasn't changed in the past 6 hours and im pretty sure they actually have ZERO volume at the moment.

I've done a 20k transaction with them before. If there's any problem it will be with your bank, not coinbase

Just use dollar cost averaging and buy in a little at a time to protect yourself from market movement - i personally think buying in at anything around $180 isnt terrible, but you must use your own discretion.

Hiding money? its not illegal to own BTC in China.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:29:43
Not sure. Contrary to what people will tell you here, keeping your coins on Coinbase under 2FA is safer for a layperson than keeping them on your computer. I would suggest while they are there you research how to put them in cold storage, but in the interim if you dont really understand how to secure your wallet, BTC aren't that safe on your computer.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:59:23
you must be joking right?
think about this for 2 seconds, merchants dont even hold BTC for the most part. not to mention the 100 other flaws of measuring this way.

You need to pick a good seed though, do not use song lyrics or something like that. It has to have never been used before anywhere and can NOT be guessed.

I actually do wish there was some way for the network to boycott specifically stolen coins  (Io theft, that China exchange that disappeared) but i also think it might be too slippery of a slope. Perhaps there is a way to do it, but i don't know what it would be.

This is the approx payout schedule for a 2H cointerra miner, and that's IF you could get it on time, which seems unlikely and at a conservative difficulty. it may very well be unprofitable even if you do get it on time.

Not really,  if I have access to your email,  I can just reset your exchange password. It is arguably less secure, because it creates 2 points of failure.
