I got a coinbase account because I'm new to this stuff and it has a very easy ux to follow. Still one of the worst decisions I've made. Nothing is working. Can't sell, then if I try too much it tells me to wait a long time. Bank blocks my card. Thought it was going to be a lot smoother sailing than this.
