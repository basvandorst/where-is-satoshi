MUCH lower fees, with more advanced trading options but no mobile app and a more confusing interface than coinbase. (You use the same login at both places.)

Coinbase charges you extra when you buy and shorts you when you sell. Plus they charge a fee on top of that... There's a pretty steep price for convenience.
Right now, the coinbase chart shows the price at $6,800 but if I go to buy it from my bank account, the strike price is $6,939 plus the charge a $23 fee. Oof!

As opposed to a wallet that you control your own private keys. Not all exchanges give you your forked coins, (at least not right away) but you have control of that if you have your own private keys.

GDAX (tied to Coinbase) limit orders with bank deposits are free transactions, no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:25:21
You transfer to GDAX for free from coinbase, make free limit order trades and free external transfers. Check YouTube for lots of how to videos.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:22:07
If you're willing to wait to transfer money via ACH or do a wire transfer and then buy at GDAX as a "post only limit order" you don't pay any fees and you set your own strike price.

I'm signing up for Gemini as we speak. It looks like they've got a lower fee structure than Coinbase. Not sure about the strike price issue though.

Market order and limit order are terms from the stock market, lots of sites describe them. Same with bid and ask.
I'll try to summarize anyway.
There are two sides of the transaction price in an order book. What people want for them (ask) and what people are offering for them (bid).
Let's say the ask price is $10 and the bid is $8. 
If you buy at market price, you kinda hold your money up and the first one to take it wins. In this scenario, if it's not moving quickly you'd pay $10. If the market is moving up very quickly you'll chase the price as it goes and pay more than everyone with existing limit orders.
To put in a limit order, you have to "bid" something lower than the ask price and hope someone reaches down to accept it. You could put in a limit order for $9 and you'd be next in line to have your order go through since you just raised the bid price compared to the $8 that the people ahead of you had already established. In a quickly rising market you could get left behind as other people keep raising their bids and the sellers keep raising their asks.
Make a little sense?

The user interface of coinbase is extremely simplified vs GDAX. In coinbase you can only buy and sell at what they determine to be the current market price (you end up buying high and selling low) and you pay fees. At GDAX, you can read the order book, specify to the penny (or fraction of a penny) what strike price you want and pay no fees on "post-only limit orders."

What does "will link you" mean? I just know that only 6 months ago Coinbase specifically recommended users migrate away from Authy to Google or Microsoft.

You sure it wasn't your CC company that cancelled it? Certain banks and CC companies are real skittish about any crypto transactions and you'll have to call to confirm it's really you trying to make them.

Yeah, the last time I waited a week for my transfer it went from $4200 to $5200! I should've just paid the fee!

I'm new to Reddit. My profile on my Android says "redditor for 2..." I had a comment (or post?) removed the other day from r/cryptocurrency because my account isn't 20 days old and old and have 10+ karma (I just barely have that now). 
You replied to my comment somewhere else and I saw that your profile says "redditor for 3..." I thought maybe the 2 or 3 was the tens digit of how many days we've been on here. I clicked mine thinking it was 20+ but it says 18 days (I guess maybe it's for weeks?). I wondered what your 3 was short for and how much karma you had, so I clicked your name. I guess your 3 is short for months instead of days or weeks. You've got 640 karma or something and I was shocked and how much more you have than me.
That's how I clicked to see your posts and comments and this was the first one at the top. I just happened to be thinking about buying some vertcoin late last night so I read this subthread. 
TL;DR I was stalking you.
