Okay, see, why can't I meet people with cool ass ideas and cool ass tables to put their cool ass things on with COOL ASS crypto ideas?! MUCH LESS, why can't I meet a single human being in real that even knows what cryptocurrency is, let alone a white paper, blockchain or anything in between?

Yeah yo same stuff has happened to me at my Uni. I’ve legit had a couple CS and Econ professors (I went from CS to Econ), call it a Ponzi scheme, and make extremely ignorant and offhanded comments comparing it Monopoly money and quantum computing will render it obsolete. It’s definitely a plausible story, most profs get their underwear in a bunch because Bitcoin doesn’t provide them viable research opportunities (aka funding and grants out the ass and a place to put their name at the bottom of a Publication in which they had their Graduate “helpers” do all the work).

The bitcoin community yes, but not just the bitcoin community.

I think mathematical models have predicted this overbuying to a science, and the news that surrounds these mathematical highs and lows only serve to provide “evidence” as to why the price is behaving as it is, albeit the “evidence” is just news surrounding the mathematical model but isn’t necessarily the driving force behind the massive bull runs and dips.

Question... of the books written by AA on Bitcoin, are the books "Bitcoin - Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies" and "Bitcoin - Programming The Open Blockchain" different books altogether, or are they a version 1, version 2 kind of thing? This is 110% a dumb question, but hopefully someone has the answer.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:51:53
I disagree, if you look back to its inception, every massive run up has almost always been followed by a massive drop (time span varies). I would like to be wrong, but I think it is very much in the realm of possibility. I also believe it'll hit 100k in 2019... so I may be crazy
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:40:27
Thinking we touch mid 2's before the next run up... thoughts?

I don't know about you, but I will ride their sweet coat tails all the way to victory.

If I run bitcoind like instructed in AA's book, Mastering Bitcoin, is this the same as a full node? And if so, are there ways to turn the node off/on via commands, or is it something you have to completely uninstall?
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:22:00
Been reading AA's book (mastering bitcoin) and holy shit. I've been a believer before, but this book just solidifies that damn near every troll in this sub has no idea what this tech even is, how it truly operates and the potential of it. Please bash me, waste your precious time and effort replying to me, but there is no changing my mind. Either I was in the most technologically advanced, well established and diabolically created ponzi schemes in all of history (which would be dope to be a part of, even if you're getting screwed) OR this is the most breakthrough revolutionary technology we've seen in a couple decades, if not more (which is ALSO dope as shit to be a part of). So it's really a win win...

1700, although the numbers calculated were done so from the ATH! So an 83% crash from 19660 would be roughly 3300.

Hey, quick question...
Been reading "Mastering Bitcoin" and I have gotten to the part about bitcoind. Yes, bitcoind. I know this is referenced to as a daemon, and I have also researched it to be a Bitcoin client. It is used to implement the Bitcoin protocol for RPC use. Can anyone ELI5 here? Surely this is not the same as running a full node, but what the hell is it?
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:40:33
Hey dude, since I still cannot manage to wrap my head around this kind of stuff, (and yes I'm sure I could find out from the internet), what does all of that mean? Specifically the liquidation of 30k at 50X leverage. Thank you!

Lol I’m a college student in an econometrics course and our midterm literally included the R^2 meaning, and that was such a common misinterpretation, so I’m glad someone else caught that.

Real question here... how does this sub feel about litecoin? Not shilling, but honestly asking. The reason I ask is because it was basically a clone of BTC with some slight changes, so are the Bitcoin maximalist that live here litecoin haters, or more of a neutral stance?
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:07:05
All these cucks in the daily talking about Bitcoin being worthless... hit me up when bitcoin is 0 dude, for real. Then I'm really gone invest in this shit, 21 million coins for free? Sign me up player

Dude, don't listen to 1980's cuckstar. The reason these people don't support is, is 99% of the time, they don't understand. I go a big state school in the Pacific Northwest and my computer science professor compared it to Monopoly money. I later went and talked to her and she didn't even know what proof of stake was, how blocks were mined and competed for, she had no idea how any of the basic shit regarding Bitcoin even worked. Quite surprising actually, considering she's the undergraduate director of the entire CS program. If you say it's a scam, 99.9% you have literally no fucking idea how this shit even works. (Not saying I'm Andreas or anything, but I have basic retard understanding of how it works to a decent degree)

110% acceptance. Bring on the sub 20 LTC (I know wrong sub, but also give me that sweet sub 3k BTC). At this point it's either all or nothing
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:36:16
My sweet child, your opinion is so worthy, Bitcoin really must be worth nothing. Thank you so much for your 36 hours of fame on Reddit. No, seriously, I thoroughly appreciate the fact you weigh in on things you have no idea about. 110% selling now, thanks dude
