* You can't buy much with it, probably nothing locally beyond a coffee
* It costs a lot of money to buy (fees)
* The value will fluctuate enormously, and using it as a national currency will not inspire confidence in investors.

He's right about everything except he's overlooking the difficulty and expense to convert traditional currency to bitcoin, and also the fact that there is currently not very much to buy with bitcoin (except drugs and expensive knick-knacks)

You seem to be implying by the design choice that bitcoin is a grassroots evolution that continues to serve the common man - but this is a misconception - no common man can now afford to mine for bitcoins, and without a thriving bitcoin market, the only people with access to bitcoin are the already-rich and bitcoin value traders. 'Plan B' seems to simply mean take money from the people who have the money now, and to give it to other rich people (who may in fact already belong to the first group of people).

@_date: 2014-09-21 04:25:31
I'm not sure, but there are cafés around here that proudly announce that they accept bitcoin, which is nice I guess. The issue becomes that there really isn't that many reasons for people to convert currency to bitcoin, except to trade upon. While I would consider converting AUD to USD if I were travelling to the US, what reason would I have otherwise?
No one is forcing me to use it, but I can't afford it, realistically (which is what this thread is about)
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:42:33

I would hope bitcoin could get rid of companies like Paypal.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:26:32
Because it is so expensive to convert currency to bitcoin (especially if you aren't selling USD) places selling products in bitcoin end up being more expensive than those which accept regular currency. Also, international prices and duty on the places you mention are pretty high.
@_date: 2014-09-21 00:39:10
I'm turned off because of the high conversion rates - for instance, if I were to buy a coffee with bitcoins, it would cost me far more than an average cup would if I payed in AUD. Also, there is no benefit to be gained from anonymously buying coffee using a complicated crypto-currency.
@_date: 2014-05-18 10:57:42

This is probably an unfair metaphor... Regulators are more likely swayed by special interest groups rather than not getting the concept behind bitcoin - after all, they probably have a financial background. Let's not make the error of underestimating them or their motives.

I'm assuming people dislike valid criticism because it can affect bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is largely based on publicity - negative publicity which can make value decrease and quickly spread is a dangerous thing to bitcoin holders - so it has become r/bitcoin's reaction to reject any criticism, or suggestion to sell. This post is another example of how the community treats criticism: it isn't welcomed or considered.

No fees! Except for when you are buying Bitcoins, of course - the conversion rate is pretty awful, and it varies wildly for one day to another, while prices remain static. 
What we need to see are dynamic prices that fluctuate in real time proportional to the value of bitcoin.

What's annoying with this sort of celebrity endorsement, is that every time it happens, prices jump back up. And so, with a little careful PR combining press releases with carefully chosen interviews, certain groups can control the market.

Makes sense. It's a conspiracy of the richer ruling class - now that the difficulty is so high, only the very rich will be able to mine bitcoins, and will soon control all the rest. Once this happens they will axe the dollar, and artificially inflate or deflate the value of bitcoin at will.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:29:33
Well not exactly. You need to convert currency, and vendors sell at different prices - in places outside the US where Bitcoin isn't as present (so less competition) this means that vendors can set the exchange rate at pretty much whatever they want. Bitcoin ATMs have been known to charge a "transaction fee" of up to 7%. Furthermore the exchange may take a long time to complete.
If you combine this with a very volatile marketplace that goes up or down based solely on media and hype, as well as the lack of products available internationally, not to mention the fact that it is completely uninsured - then bitcoin is still a rather unattractive proposition to the end user.
@_date: 2015-02-26 05:31:41
What's the breakdown? Is currency conversion included here?  As an Australian, it's cheaper for me to buy USDs than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:02:00
What is the motivation for the average person to use bitcoin, considering all the fees are paid by the end user instead of the merchant?  I can see why this would be appealing to businesses, but bitcoin adds expense.

* I'm not the one raising the points, the article is. These criticisms can all be addressed collectively as part of refuting or agreeing with the article, there is very little value in spreading out the criticisms, since 1) they have likely already been raised and 2) would no longer form a coherent argument in context with the article.
* These are indeed good points of discussion. 
* None of these points mentions a geographical location or time period
* Read the article, man.
You're not making sense.
@_date: 2015-02-09 07:23:40
It raises several good points, even if it doesn't do so very gracefully.
* no fees attached to it, including taxes, in most cases
* fees are paid by the purchaser and not by the vendor (Merchants have an incentive to accept Bitcoin because fees are lower than the 2-3% typically charged by credit card processors)
* According to a study, it is not a free-floating supply and situation that drives the prices, but rather “popularity” that drives the price
* Not all countries and companies will accept Bitcoin currency
* Whether or not your information is private
* Corruption
It's understandable, especially in regards to point 3, that there can never be a balanced discussion regarding Bitcoin in this forum as long as investors are part of the discussion.
