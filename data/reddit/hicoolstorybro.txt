This most closely resembles a 3 day moving average.  Basically you take the average price for the past 3 days and plot it.  You can see for yourself by looking here:

Today is the day I finally feel comfortable paying Coinbase's transaction fee due to the memepool finally clearing 5-10 say/byte transactions.  Time to move this stash offline and into my control.

5 sat/byte here, 4 outputs to 1 segwit yesterday.  Confirmed in next block, took 2 minutes.

Just want to point out that LitBox which is currently being developed using [MIT's open sourced multi-coin lightning node software]( is aiming at costing 30$ (it inevitably will cost more than that but nowhere near this 300$ price tag).

or 19697 - the high on GDAX at 1030 CST. probably like 19750 on coinbase if you were unlucky enough.

You need to use a wallet that supports Segwit addresses.  I recommend doing so to reduce your fee and selling it on localbitcoins.com

Anyone is free to work on the code...  There is no qualification.  Sure someone was given the password to the bitcoin GitHub by Satoshi but everything done to the code there is publicly seen and submitted not just by them but by countless volunteers like you and I.  If there really was a problem a group of active users could simply fork away and concensus would rule which one is called Bitcoin.

Quantum computing will kill most all modern cryptocurrencies unless they adapt. I fear a time in between in which the encryption is cracked and all private keys are revealed. This is the main reason why you all shouldn't be thinking so long term with these technologies in their current state. Think more next 10-15 years and you will be safer.

@_date: 2018-11-17 15:44:17
No, but you might as well create new ones that support Segwit addresses (begin with 3) to show support and when fees climb back again.

Do you not realize that there are world governments that will prop the price up completely based on a potential for future use?  Do you not realize how much fiat currency and assets are in this world?  Do you not think that governments are entertaining the idea of accumulating bitcoin for the long-term, just *in-case* there is a global tear away from fiat currencies and bitcoin sees real adoption?  Don't think governments will sit this out.

The market is deciding whether to correct the recent uptrend or continue to correct last year's bull run.  This is a significant moment for the short term (1 year) projection.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:23:14
Same, I was a bit disappointed but not surprised when it bottomed at 6k.  I always thought it would need to test the 5.5k support before an uptrend.

I made the same 4200$ conclusion an hour ago actually.  I am going to start buying at 4500$ and below.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:27:01
say your end goal is to invest 1000$... buy 100$ during each time you feel there is a dip going on.  sell back 50$ each time you feel there is a high going on. if you are patient you will have successfully dollar cost averaged your position in a smart way and can sit and wait on it for awhile.

I don't believe BTC growth will ever slow down enough for your 4% interest yearly to catch up.  I recommend you research altcoins and consider investing a chunk more (like 2k) into one or two low-medium priced alts that show promise for growth in the short-term.  
I own a similar amount of BTC but I recently got lucky with an alt-coin which has almost 4x'd my initial investment of 1k.  If I wanted to, I could exchange my alts right now for a cumulative of 1 BTC even though I have only spent half the current price of 1 BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-18 03:22:46
so what I'm getting from this is that on average the dip is greater than 10% so in regard to our ATH last week that would mean the dip is very likely less than 5300$.

Ah.  If I were you, I would invest half of whatever extra money I get from allowance/birthday/graduation into crypto.  Don't worry too much about the prices you buy at. A good idea is to invest a certain amount once a month.  If you live in the US, prices generally tend to be lower in the morning (after asia goes to sleep).  
Talk to your parents about it, too.  Perhaps they can help you with an account on an exchange like GDAX or Gemini where you can buy small amounts.  Also, store your coins on a paper wallet and store it somewhere safe that you can let sit for years.  It will eliminate the chance of you losing them.

In the past month or so, someone posted a website that showed live market buys and sells for bitcoin across multiple exchanges.  You could select the $ value you would like to see trades above (larger than 100k for example, or 1M).  Anyone remember what it was?  It had support for Ethereum as well at the time.

Nothing is giving you anything lol.  He is saying that coins in your possession from Bitcoin before August 2017 may be split into BCH/BTC and the BCH split into BCH/BCHSV.  Therefore old core coins (unspent since August 2017) will contain the transaction history for the fork of BCHSV
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:01:23
Not directly, you have to split the BTC TO BCH first.
