Hey man i been in a position like yours. Everything jumped up 30%? buy back in would be my advice. The 30% "loss" will be a traffic ticket compared to what we have coming our way. XD

I use a smaller exchange and watch the main exchange for dips. The action happens on the large exchange determines what happens on the smaller exchange. There is obviously a lot of people who do this ( you will see when you try)  but its increases your odds a lot. Still takes balls of steel though and once you get up a lot i would recommend trading only 50% or something cause if the amount affects your judgment you will make mistakes.

Ah. You know btc used to only be divisible by 100

So when that fork happens does satoshi remain the smallest unit or can we make up a name for them. I think 100 “Elon” should equal 1 satoshi. 
I figure it would be voted on. Here’s my nominations for the name of sub satoshi units. 
1. Elon
  2.musk
    3. Keanu
      4. Reeves

Thanks for this, I’m going to do more in depth research on RVN. I’m in Houston, markets are good here. I have a location in mind. Sorry I did not mean “crazy” in that context. That was poor word choice. Spontaneous is what I meant, so I added a spontaneous response. Yes these are my plans. Me and my soon to be wife dream of it owning our own business and i can taste it.  However it sounds like a lot of fun sailing the world.

Yes I did! I have more BTCP I could have imagined. Nearly double of what I thought was a good amount to hold. So great!

It’s tapped out I believe. My gf plays it and i saw a notification about crypto craze in Springfield. Lol 
The updates usually coexist with the episodes. I’m sure we can expect a crypto episode soon!!

Help me start a dog grooming salon. Start up could be less than 3k more than what I have. Integrating crypto payments would boost sales. Huge profit margin to be made. Especially if we offer boarding and  dog daycare. I know it seems a crazy offer but, not as crazy as sailing across the world! Haha.

Yes, I don’t know shit but here is my 2 cents. 
Whales trustee sells btc to his rich 2nd cousin “OTC.”
Bid is X amount of btc @ 5k/btc. 
Whale agrees 
2nd cousin then dumps his coin on the books. 
2nd cousin buys whale a yacht. 
This is speculation at its finest.
