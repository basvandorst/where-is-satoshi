I love the fact that they are using Bitcoins and giving you 3 days to spend, fixed at the rate when you top up.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:21:58
You have got to be joking! Why would they start with nukes and coke? Its a great idea for bitcoins to be used as a trading medium, but just as we are starting to get accepted they put this on the front page. It's as if the people who want to destroy bitcoins have paid for a front page add. This should be downvoted.just watch this and tell me I'm wrong.

I just read this on the post and used the link. Washington, DC, — June 11, 2015 – The core developers of the OpenBazaar project announced today they’ve received a $1 million round of seed funding from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar that will help fuel their vision of making trade free for everyone, everywhere.
“The Internet has decentralized communications, and Bitcoin has decentralized money, but online commerce still relies on numerous intermediaries,” says Brian Hoffman, the project lead. “OpenBazaar removes the intermediaries and gives everyone – individuals to large companies – the ability to directly engage in trade with anyone in the world, for free.”

Have you used them. I"m a 65 year old who is excited about Bitcoins and its potential. I would love to do my "Bit". I am flying to Amsterdam and their quote is great, I"m just doing my due diligence by asking this great community. Thank you for the great link.

@_date: 2014-03-16 16:20:02
Thanks, this post from earlier is why I ask the question.  The relevant legislation and case law will be applied to determine the correct tax treatment. Therefore, depending on the facts, a transaction may be so highly speculative that it is not taxable or any losses relievable.. For example gambling or betting wins are not taxable and gambling losses cannot be offset against other taxable profits.     WE CAN GET ENOUGH EVIDENCE FROM EXPERTS IE BUFFET   BITCORN  AND MOST OF "THE FINANCIAL EXPERTS" EVEN A GREEK UNIVERSITY LECTURER   OF ECONOMICS THAT THIS WAS AND IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE THUS NON TAXABLE \o/.This could be a help to us all.

Try coinjar, I had Bitcoins into Fiat on my coinjar swipe card in minutes. You can also load the card with fiat through Bpay. It works great

Read down to the vision. if I read it correctly they are saying bitcoin is safer but slower
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:27:51
It's well worth a read. I'm betting a big spike in the price.

 START OFPAGE 18 distributed ledger requires greater trust in the validators or operators of
the ledger. For example, the global financial transactions system Ripple
selects a list of validators (known as Unique Node Validators) from up to 200
known, unknown or partially known validators who are trusted not to collude
in defrauding the actors in a transaction. This process provides a digital
signature that is considered less censorship resistant than Bitcoin’s, but is
significantly faster.

They are great. Good support and so far so good! I've used them since they first started in Australia, they have moved to the UK now and still working well. They also have a good "swipe card"

I am a swipe user since its inception and an early customer of Coinjar.It is a great service, easy to use, with good support.  my question is will you be adding other currencies for when we travel. Thanks for your innovation in the bitcoin to fiat ease of use.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:31:07
coinjar works seamlessly for me
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:34:29
I am not an expert just a user. they allow me to top up my swipe card with btc automatically,they do the conversion to fiat, and as far as I can tell there is a 2% profit in it for them.
It is the ease of use that I like, I can buy btc via Bpay and use the funds often within hours if I use the same bank as they do.
I can pay my bills and use ATMs with the card, thus, I hope, backing a company that started here in Australia and has since moved to London. 
As a none techy it is my way of supporting a system that I think is the future.
