Bitcoin payments are irreversible. Paypal is not. Also paypal forbids you to buy btc with it.
Best thing is to ask your clients to pay you via circle.com. They can buy btc via their credit card there.

Yes! I said the same thing over [here](

Oh yeah. He's just getting started. It's absolutely *essential* that you teach him how to do cold storage, offline wallets, bip38 and multisig as well so that he can squirrel away his precious 0.001 btc hoard.

How many times do I have to answer this? I guess I'll edit my comment above to make it clearer. Give me a sec...

This is what electrum does. 12 words is enough to represent a 128 bit random seed.

Remittances via banking or "official" channels like WU or SWIFT are **subsidized** by 3rd world governments. That's right. It's like the oil lobby. So if you bothered to do the math you would see that circle is still too expensive. 2.9% to upload money, 2.9% to withdraw at the other end and the bitcoin volatility to boot.

Not true. All bitcoin transactions are public and data mining the blockchain will one day be very profitable. Another problem is that the fungibility of bitcoin is at risk with a public ledger. For example the threat posed by "coin validation".


Bitcoin is very inflationary. The supply of the currency increases by 3600 btc a day which is 9%+ per year at this point in time.

Well that's a shame. If the idea was to cater to ordinary people then a USD denominated wallet would have been better. Now they have to worry about the volatility and so they will be reluctant to sign up for this.

Price inflation is usually caused by too much money chasing too few goods. In this case it is because of the creation of too many new bitcoins.

Easier ways to do this:
* Use brainwallet.org converter tab to convert hex/b58check -&gt; poetry (uses electrum dictionary)
* Grab mnemonic.py from lib/ in [1.9.8 electrum]( It can run all by itself:
   
    python mnemonic.py \`openssl rand -hex 16\` 
    python mnemonic.py \`openssl rand -hex 32\` 
One caveat with mnemonic.py is that the number of ~~bits~~ hex characters has to be a multiple of 8 otherwise it will discard some digits. So be careful about that. A bitcoin private key is 256 bits or 64 hex digits so it can be safely encoded as a 24 word mnemonic.

Are balances fixed in USD or bitcoin? What I mean is that if they are denominated in USD and the USD/BTC exchange rate changes you would still have the same USD but more or less bitcoin that before. Is that how it works?

It is not available for consumers and the merchant acceptance has a lot of conditions attached to it.

You should take it up with the government. Oh wait...

You don't know what the fuck you are talking about:
Scroll down to the part about dhclient. *Everyone* is running that. As root no less.

My god man circle only opened up to the world yesterday. As for coinbase it clearly states on their site that you need a US or European country bank account:

Excuses, excuses. It is inflationary. That's all that matters. The fed could also argue that QE is designed to stimulate demand and if they hadn't done that banks would have collapsed taking the rest of the economy with them.

First of all thank you for writing all this. I've heard about how convenient Qiwi is for Russians. Is it true that there is a kiosk on practically every street corner there? I did not know that all payment systems were irreversible and that is indeed interesting.
There are three ways to deal with confirmation delays:
- Accept unconfirmed transactions for low value products. You will have to bear the cost of fraud.
- Do something like mycelium does where they have servers that are connected to a large number of nodes and if the majority of those nodes have heard of the transaction then it's less likely it will be double spent. So they "survey" those nodes and give you a number that tells you  how likely it is the transaction will go through. 
- Look at greenaddress.it. It's a 2 of 2 multisig wallet with the site having one key and the user the other. So because they are a party to the transaction they can prevent double spends and say with certainty that you will get your bitcoins.
Now because mycelium and greenaddress are centralized services they could be shutdown by hostile governments. As for option number 1, if the government was opposed to it they could bombard you with a lot of a low value transactions that are then double spent. So you'd be forced to insist on confirmations.
