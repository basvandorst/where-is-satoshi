That is one guy saying this though.  The canary theory holds some water. Read up on Steve and make up your mind for yourself.

In the 90's, VHS/Betamax meant private porn.  In 2009, the Internet had that covered.

This guy basically created a blogspot, wrote 200 words with no evidence to support it and this sub is wetting itself.

There's a tor build floating around, it could help solve that problem.
That is if tor can be secured against whatever caused a simultaneous takedown of 400 darkweb sites.
