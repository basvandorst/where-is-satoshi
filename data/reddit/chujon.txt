That's a nice argument, kid.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:40:35


So state magically enables somehow to have an army? People cannot use guns without the state or what?


Not really. World would be much nicer without having armies. Especially state-owned ones.


Not really as you're justifying stealing from people.


You could do that...you know...voluntarily.


Yes, that's why I said you're submissive.

Why don't you give me half of your income. You wouldn't want to steal from me, would you? Grow up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:28:22
They're taking my money without my consent. There, it's a theft.
If a gang says "we now have a law that you have to give us your money", it's no longer a theft if they steal from you? If the state says you have to kill black people, it's no longer a murder in your eyes? Because the state said so?
Sorry, I would rather break the law than be a blind obedient sheep.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:54:14
State is taking them by force. It's a theft. What he does with it is irrelevant, it's still a theft.

So...if your country elects the new Hitler, you'll be like "Hey, if you don't like genocide, go live somewhere remote and off the grid. There you go, free of genocide."? Weak and submissive people like you are the reason governments do whatever they want and go away with it.

Well since taxation is theft, it's irrational to me.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:25:39
That sounds a little brainwashy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:55:12


No, I don't. You do realize there are other countries, right?


No, I don't. But the gang that created those laws will go after me with force.


That's like telling a slave "you can talk to your master". 


I don't like the state as a whole. What then?


No, I won't. IRS or any state entity stealing money from people does not have the technical capabilities to go after me. This is why cryptocurrency and cryptography in general are the most imporant inventions of our time.


Yes. I'm willing to risk it. I could not live with myself if I gave up my freedom just to be left alone by the state mafia.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:54:30


Yes. Why would I let someone steal from me? Makes no sense.

Bitcoin is about doing whatever the fuck I want with my Bitcoin. Thus, nothing I do with it can go against any "fundamental values of Bitcoin". Even if such thing even existed.
@_date: 2018-08-25 10:27:12


You could've just stopped there. If I want to let someone else control my keys, it's my decision.
If most of the supply ends up like that we obviously need something better than Bitcoin to get that "advance in society". You can't force people to behave according to your subjective agenda. If most of the people use it like that then that's what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:50:19
There is an argument. You just failed to understand it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:17:29
So people who lived in countries with slavery or mass murdering of jews all agreed to it? So if you live in a country where the govt is doing something bad, you should agree with it or leave?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:26:36
Well you started with that. You basically attacked him and said "I cannot imagine something, therefore it cannot exist.". You want a mature answer for such a shitty argument? 
Try this:
"This is such a childish argument. A bank is required for double spending protection. Without which, you wouldn't have a system in which to can rely on people not cheating.
Without banks how do you propose we have regulations, taxation and a working society?"
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:51:13
Sorry, you don't use logic. This conversation is pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:14:07


"This is such a childish argument."


"This is such a childish argument."


"This is such a childish argument."


"This is such a childish argument."

He can't, because he has no idea how any of them work. He just want to shill Monero.

It can be banned. Not the network but the usage. If every country bans it the value would drop to almost 0 and the only use would be black markets.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:59:56
No, always.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:50:47


@_date: 2017-09-24 15:48:02
You're beyond help, sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:53:00
I don't see any difference between an elected government raising taxes and a gang stealing money, sorry. I don't even understand what magically gives the government any legitimacy. Except for having more guns.
I want to pay for services, but I want to choose by myself.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:44:38
Because you have no option to not pay it. You are forced to pay whether you agree or not.
There is a ton of articles online describing how the society could work without the state. You can have private police and private roads etc. The state adds absolutely NOTHING to that. It just takes your money and spends it on stuff, the same thing you could do yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:30:56
And why the fuck would you let the government steal your money and then provide you with some services instead of you paying for whatever the fuck you want? I would rather pay for health care than having a shitty one provided by the state.
And you know what? Give me half of your income and I will clean your car once in a month. Your neighbor already pays me and says "WHO WOULD CLEAN MY CAR IF WE DON'T PAY HIM? YOU ENJOY PAYING FOR CAR CLEANING OUT OF YOUR POCKET?".
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:36:55
So if you're born in a neighborhood where some gang periodically steals money from everyone, you'll be like "you have to abide to their laws or move away"? Oh and you have an option to join their gang and try to change the amount of money the're stealing. Awesome, thanks.
If I think taxes are theft, I will do everything I can to not pay them.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:26:17
Saying it's racist is racist.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:54:29


Great argument, I have lost. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:33:37
So what? If someone takes my money and then gives it to someone with a baby, it's magically not a theft?
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:49:32
12k IOTA is not even worth a single dollar and he wants 1 btc for it. (:trollface:)

Don't buy USD, it's a scam.

I seriously hope your post is a joke.
