dude, this is so nonsensical. It is so wrapped up in the groupthink here of dollars -- evil, bitcoin -- good. I don't think you even see the nonsense. Just another in the long tradition of "Problem with Bitcoin? What problem? Nothing to see here folks. Let's get this hype train back on track."
So all the rich brain surgeons, and heart surgeons, and Steven Spielbergs, and Tiger Woods, and Bill Gates, and... other people with lots of dollars are responsible for " destroys billions of lives, and creates economic slavery throughout the world." because they are participants in a monetary system to which there is not much alternative. I guess they should have been ascetics living in a cave then they wouldn't have to carry that burden of guilt.
Granted the distribution of wealth and financial game playing/scamming in the US is a problem, but I don't think the solution is to switch to an even more lopsided system.

except not...
Most human endeavors are not zero-sum.
If a scientist makes a discovery, it doesn't take away from someone else, everyone can potentially benefit.
If an artist creates something brilliant everyone can enjoy it.
If a northern-hemisphere business imports fruit from the southern hemisphere in the winter, you get fruit out of season and the business gets some of your cash.

Wow, I'm impressed you typed all that in six minutes.
Everybody sees the world differently and I think this might be an example of growth mindset vs. fixed mindset.
For the bathroom and traffic examples, insofar as things we describe as specific collections of atoms cannot occupy the same spacetime, sure, but who really cares.
Most of the things you listed, in fact, are not really zero-sum games.  You're talking about things of which there are a potentially limited supply, and the number of people desiring those things potentially exceeding the supply of things, also known as market dynamics.  These are not zero sum games, because in the initial state nobody had the things and you can't 'lose' something if you never had it.
I get what your saying about well maybe the 'opportunity' to get those things is taken away, But I don't think that really fits the definition of zsg.
And opportunities come and go, seeds are planted and crops are harvested.
Can you see the difference I'm describing here?
The link above gives poker as an example of a zero-sum game.  Everyone puts their money in the pot for a hand and then the winner only increases their money because others lose theirs. Similar dynamic at play in bitcoin as long as people keep using it mainly to attempt to increase their fiat wealth and it doesn't become the currency of an economy, again, I think it was working alright for the silkroaders et al a couple years ago. 
btw, I was treating 'human endeavors' and 'life' as synonymous. You're a living human, you're endeavoring as a human in life, etc.
Also btw, the 'three things' were three generalities meant to cover broad swaths of human activity.

Here is how you should go about it.
First, acquire 6 figures usd worth of bitcoins.
Then make a post on reddit asking advice on how to buy 7 figures usd worth of bitcoins in an attempt to drive up the price of bitcoins. If you are successful in driving up the price, then sell your previously acquired 6 figures worth crashing the price.
Then use your increased usd holdings from this scheme to buy 7 figures usd worth of bitcoins. 
Then make a post on reddit asking advice on how to buy 8 figures usd worth of bitcoins in an attempt to drive up the price of bitcoins. If you are successful in driving up the price, then sell your previously acquired 7 figures worth crashing the price.
Then use your increased usd holdings from this scheme to buy 8 figures usd worth of bitcoins. 
Then make a post on reddit asking advice on how to buy 9 figures usd worth of bitcoins in an attempt to drive up the price of bitcoins. If you are successful in driving up the price, then sell your previously acquired 8 figures worth crashing the price.
Then use your increased usd holdings from this scheme to buy 9 figures usd worth of bitcoins. 
Then make a post on reddit asking advice on how to buy 10 figures usd worth of bitcoins in an attempt to drive up the price of bitcoins. If you are successful in driving up the price, then sell your previously acquired 9 figures worth crashing the price.
Then use your increased usd holdings from this scheme to buy 10 figures usd worth of bitcoins. 
Then make a post on reddit asking advice on how to buy 11 figures usd worth of bitcoins in an attempt to drive up the price of bitcoins. If you are successful in driving up the price, then sell your previously acquired 10 figures worth crashing the price.
Then use your increased usd holdings from this scheme to buy 11 figures usd worth of bitcoins. 
Repeat until you get bored, or your computers memory runs out of space for representing your 'x figures of' variable.

This statement doesn't make any sense. Anything people use for savings, be it currencies, gold, stocks, real estate, stamps, comic books, etc. have at least one other use. That is why people are confident they can recover at least some of the value they traded for it at a future date.
If bitcoin has no tangible, practical use beyond being a brand name with name recognition, what is to stop another cryptocurrency/distributed ledger system with genuine usefulness from quickly subsuming any value bitcoin once had?

Did you mean to say, "no one in the 1%"?
If bitcoin is good for anything, getting people to think about money is one of them.
Dollars aren't real, they are an arbitrary unit of account/medium of exchange, you know like bitcoin. 
Those things you listed, they are denominated in... dollars(at least if they are purchased in the US)
So if you are holding those things you are in effect holding dollars because if you want to trade those things for something else, you'll likely first trade them for dollars, then trade the dollars for something else.

Thanks for your contribution. It sure is a relief to read that "Gox is almost irrelevant now, by daily volume," compared to what was written in the article(which I'm sure you read,) "today, MtGox accounts for about one-third of trade."
While these two statements appear on the surface to be contradictory and in fact could be said to be contradictory, after all the earth's surface is about 1/3 land and not many people dismiss land as irrelevent when discussing the composition of the earth's surface. 
I think many of us will choose to take your statement as the more reliable source on this matter, if for no other reason than, it is what most of us want to hear.
Once again thank you for correctly informing those of us who read the article and maybe even those who haven't.

Who cares? Do you mind explaining what that is supposed to mean, why it is desirable, let alone why it is worth paying significantly more for coins than you could otherwise get them for?
If you think people with bitcoins are going to have to somehow prove they are not the result of illicit activities, anyone purchasing on an exchange has a paper trail showing that's where they came from.

Someone with a lot of bitcoins who wants them to be worth more.  
One of the basic dynamics of bitcoin.  
"Bitcoins are awesome!"  
"Why?"  
"Because if you think they are awesome,  
 I'll think they are awesomer because mine will be worth more!  
 To the moon!"  
"Awesome!"

dollars   
   
top 1%    holds 34.6% of dollars   
  
  
Not entirely apples to apples because for btc it is percentages of addresses and for dollars it is percentage of population.
Percentages with wallet balance greater than .001 btc.
top 1% 66.44%

See the updated numbers, it was a good observation(except for the zomg part, that didn't occur) but your assumption of a more uniform distribution didn't quite pan out.
You see even though you see that 95% of all addresses have less than a .001 balance and you think "zomg"(or whatever acronyms color your thoughts) the amount of addresses that hold the majority of bitcoins is still very small compared to even 1 percent of all addresses.

A map is just a representation on paper, does it have value?
Not sure what distinction you're trying to make though. Why does it matter if the representation of ownership is in the form of a piece of paper if that representation of ownership has an underlying value?
What difference does it make if the ownership is represented in the form of paper, clam shell, or entry in a database?

Can we implement a citation needed rule to try to raise the level of discourse around here.  
So your response to a genuine problem for bitcoin is that it doesn't matter because this thing I really want to happen is going to happen, I just know it is it really really is, if I just close my eyes and wish really hard...
Never mind that your supposed solution isn't even a solution.
And just to put on the critical thinking cap a little more, if "their holdings were to dwarf the existing 1%" then we would have a situation where not 1% of addresses hold 99% percent of the bitcoins, but 0.1%, 0.01%? What would constitute a dwarfing?

Does this seem backwards to anybody else, all this talk about funds?  Sure, there are ETFs for many currencies around the world and they are meant to give investors exposure to economic doings of economies as whole.
But the bitcoin economy is composed if not primarily, then by much speculation.  So buying into a bitcoin fund is essentially speculating on speculation, without even the option of using the purchased bitcoin in anyway to make the speculation pay off.
Seems to just reinforce the notion that bitcoins primary value is that of a hot potato.


Pretty sure that never happened(the briefest 100% gain seems to be over about a week or so, and there was obviously no 100% loss, let alone in a day*), and makes me wonder along with the bit about market cap being the wrong term because it's calculated in the same way it's always been calculated, [if the author has any idea what he's talking about.](
*unless you want to include the non-trivial amount of bitcoins affected when mtgox was like "Hey guys, you know that website we have where people buy and sell bitcoins and stuff? How about we replace it with a blank page, that'd be cool right?"

Because as you say they are ownership of a company making the holder entitled to any dividends paid by the company so it can be said they can used to accumulate profits.  
The company to which they represent ownership has a use so they can be said to have a fraction of that use, and with enough of them they can be used to direct the actions the company.
Because they are partial ownership of a company, they be said to be a partial claim on the assets of the company, which no doubt have a use.
And because they are a claim to something of tangible value this allows them to be used a means of exchange.

I agree, I think this sentence gives it away though.

So you're saying the buyer would use a government currency to buy bitcoin, then buy something from a seller, then the seller would use the bitcoin to buy govt. currency?
Why would any rational economic actor(yes, I know that's a loaded term) do this when --
a. purchasing anything this way (apart from silkroad items, or things for sale only in btc) is going to be far more of a hassle than using whatever other payment method the seller offers
b. the buyer will likely end up paying more due to fees accrued in the conversion process
This isn't to say anything about the merits of bitcoin, just that this situation seems to make little sense.  The only potential beneficiaries of such a situation are the holders of bitcoin because this would purport to demonstrate the value of bitcoin by demonstrating it's use in practice, but as we've just seen it's a mirage, why would anybody do this... but for 'the cause?' 
Additionally, were the transaction volume of btc to increase in a major way, that would show it's supposed utility thus increasing it's value and thus increasing demand for btc and there goes the vaunted stability.  But, maybe these are just growing pains for btc to finds it's place in the world.
So yeah, it's a tough question. Bitcoin would seem to have it's merits, but where exactly do they lie, and how do we get from here to there?

Nobody said it was impossible just that with the current systems there are many measures in place to curtail the scams.  
Bitcoin wasn't designed with those sort of mechanisms, not because it was designed to facilitate fraud, but as a side effect of what it was designed to do.  
Are you more likely to be scammed using bitcoin than paypal or credit cards?
That's hard to say, the total dollar amount of fraudulent transactions is no doubt higher in the paypal, credit card systems, because that's where the money is.
Fraudulent transactions as a percentage of total transactions could likely be higher with bitcoin  because the number of merchants in the bitcoin economy is so small compared to the massiveness of the paypal, credit card accepting merchants that just 100 scamming btc merchants could be a significant percentage of the total bitcoin economy.


Right, that's what I said, bitcoin relies on things external to the payment system to deal with fraud.


I wouldn't call it risk free, because as you said scammers can be clever bastards and what you think is a known identity may turn out not to be and just because you can sue somebody doesn't mean the transaction is not going to be a net loss, even if you get your money back or whatever, it's going to take a lot of time and court procedure to get to that point.

Really man?  It doesn't help anyone to not think clearly about things.  
As far as I know with most current online payment systems, paypal, debit/credit cards ... there are customer protections built in, you can tell them you're not happy with the transaction and it can be reversed.  With bitcoin, it's like putting cash in an envelope and putting it in the mail, when it's gone it's gone.
Also, to setup the receiving end of most online transaction, there is usually at least some verification that goes into that, with bitcoin you just press 'generate new address.' 
So right now bitcoin purchasers rely on reputation and community trust and whatnot, and that requires some people to take risks to build that trust usually.  Maybe something else will come along.  
And cash in the mail did use to be more common, but mainly for trinkets advertised in the backs of magazines I think. 
So in summary, to say that bitcoin is just as risk free as systems that were designed explicitly with the purpose of being as risk free as possible for the customers to entice them to spend their money so the providers of those systems can make money with transaction fees, really... come on...
Bitcoin wasn't designed with those goals in mind.  Not to say that something can't emerge to help reduce counterparty risk in bitcoin transactions, but that is certainly not where it's utility currently lies.

What the hell kind of question is that?  I think most people understand value(in a monetary/economic exchange sense) to be, the use and utility of a thing relative to it's ease of being acquired/total supply. i.e. Air is immensely useful, but good luck making any money selling bottled air. 
So what else could there possibly be that would determine the value?  Bitcoin collectors? Even then, they would be *using* it as something to collect.
It's almost like they are saying, "If this doesn't work out as planned, is there any other way it can make us rich."
