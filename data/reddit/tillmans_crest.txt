Plays even worse in China

I didn’t follow your line of thinking. Can you please explain further?
I think Bitcoin will negatively impact or undermine fiat currency, monetary policy as a tool, exchanges rates, ability for Gov’t to pay existing debts and issue new treasuries, and a lot more.
I think national govt’s might (very likely) roll out their own crypto and blockchain, control it like fiat today, and then make cryptos illegal within their country (no fiat to illegal crypto trading)
What do you think?

And China. Exchanges shut down and ICOs illegal. No more RMB to crypto trading in China. What happened in Morocco?

This sounds like a decimated market. Extremely illiquid, inefficient and high risk (illegal) transactions. If many govts do this, the price would crash and 99.9% of users would give up, maybe some would barter on Tor. What do you think?

Do you know of any decentralized exchanges now? Would they deal in fiat also or only cryptos? I’m concerned if cryptos only then the market will be suffocated. What do you think?

here's a brief Forbes article on what happened in China: they made exchanges illegal. seems like a massive blow to me, but i'm not sure. maybe the Chinese have found a way to continue trading, but the volume must be a small fraction of what it used to be, and willingness to trade must be way down.

This seems like a predictable response and big risk

What if exchanges are shut down?
You think people can trade cash for BTC?? I don’t follow 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:39
That’s true, there would still be a market even tho underground and smaller

If cryptos are made illegal, isn’t that all that’s necessary? A country’s fiat could be blocked from participating. And how would one cash out their holdings? My thinking might be wrong or simplistic, not sure...

What’s the risk that governments shut down bitcoin entirely? I’m not sure how this will happen but seems like a risk they will try.

Well with net neutrality being rolled back crypto mining and exchanges could be shut off hypothetically, right?
China made illegal crypto exchanges in China and using RMB (Chinese currency), why couldn’t this also be done in the US, EU countries, Japan Korea and elsewhere?

Interesting. Would you mind sharing your view why? Much appreciated!
Bitcoin will negatively impact or undermine fiat currency, monetary policy as a tool, exchanges rates, ability for Gov’t to pay existing debts and issue new treasuries, and a lot more.
Why won’t or can’t the powers that be shut this down?

I’ll google the Venezuela case, thanks. 
But China made illegal crypto exchanges in PRC and RMB/crypto trading. This can happen anywhere right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:59
Doesn’t China already have &gt;51% of BTC mining power? They made exchanges illegal and cannot trade RMB/crypto.
