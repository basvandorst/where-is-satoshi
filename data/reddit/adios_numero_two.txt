Picked up just below $10k which has been my goal ever since it reached $15k. I first got serious about crypto when it was at $2k and didn't believe my friend giving its future valuation at potentially $500k, because I didn't think it could go past $5k. I still don't think it will ever hit $500k per coin but I think it could potentially level off somewhere in the range of $10-$100k depending how much of its utility will be able to reach day to day use in mainstream. Once big tech brands like Paypal, Apple or Microsoft legitimize its usefulness, it will skyrocket.

Very good answer, and thank you.

So am I missing something? Isn't it ironic then that we are trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges owned by a third party such as Coinbase, GDAX, Bitfinex and being charged fees?

It will reach $50k first.

$500k per coin would put market cap at $10.5 trill, with gold being at $7.8 trill. Yeah not too sure about that, $100k is more believable.

If they were going to do that, Bitcoin Cash wouldn't exist.

What is your projected valuation of BTC at full adoption? Mine is between $20,000 - $50,000 as the market will level out.

I just put my entire fiat into crypto. Goodbye dolla bills. I hope I can use these bitcoins to buy everything later haha! All I got now is Paypal, BtC &amp; Credit Cards

The price can only grow if demand and buys come in from new investors.

Bitcoin won't be useful as a currency for decades. Just stash them away in the $2000-$3000 range and you'll be happier waking up from a cryogenic sleep in the year 3000.

Name 3 practical things you can purchase with BTC on February 4th 2019. While you work on that I can name 500 things you'll be able to purchase with BTC in February 4th 3019, and one of them includes a weekend round trip flight to Mars. Digital currency will be the only kind by 2200, and quantum time-space continuum particle traveling and vehicle "horsepower" will be calculated in speeds of lightyear by 2500.

Yes indeed. It will come in handy once I am in the market for an apartment after my moon lambo purchase. Thanks for the tip.

Goddamnit, it's because of Bitcoin investing became a meme.... And I'm loving every second of it.
