I'm not sure what i'm supposed to take out of this reply.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:19
You and i both know you're just making shit up.
Good talk.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:18:52
Sure if you live in fantasy land.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:34:42
It's kind of sad how many bag holders won't get this until it's too late.
On an unrelated note.... i have some tulips for sale, nicest you've ever seen. Next internet fad for sure!
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:46:38
Yeah it's very healthy putting your money in something your country bans you from ever making liquid.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:26:25
You're better suited opening a 401k or rrsp if you're in Canada and getting in to something like couch potato investing so you have financial security for you and your spouse. Bitcoin and are too sides of the same high risk coin, and nobody should be getting involved with either if you don't have buttloads of disposable income, with lots of it to replace your losses.
The rich have made their money off bitcoin, the hype is dying... and you get in now, all you'll have are a few rotten tulips in a few years.

@_date: 2018-01-18 20:46:57
Wait until the price drops drastically, then make a whole bunch of posts on reddit about how it'll go back up. Repeat until worth nothing and kill yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:14:27
Good job playing the nerds and getting out before the bag landed.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:57:27
But isn't the point to take all your money out of your bank accounts and put it in to bitcoin?
Just buy them all at once and you'll never need your real bank again.
Well until you want to eat some food.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:55:47
What' the difference between learning about saving money and investing in bitcoin? Both need just as much research to make sure you're making an informed and smart decision. 
You're right though, learning how to budget and keep your finances in check is definitely something that should be taught in school. But it and 1000's of other real life skills aren't, and we all need to take initiative if that's what we want. It's not easy, and your assumption that i've somehow had it easy is absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:33:42
Try being less of a crybaby then.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:58:45
Why would sporting events bring in more money for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:48:13
hahahahahahaha shopping.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:17:43
Enjoy losing all your money :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:16:26
Gift cards are bought with dollars, air miles are the product of purchases in dollars, and an exchange is because i bought something in dollars.
Not to mention all of those things required dollars paid to workers, and used for materials to create.
Buying a beer for a friend still represents a dollar value, as you can't buy a beer with bitcoin, or any other trade-able good for that matter unless ordering it online(after you bought that volatile bitcoin with your hard earned dollars).
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:56:42
Seems like a legit webpage... been in business for generations. Wrote 4 articles.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:00:46
Listening to the internet got you in to this mess... so you return to the internet for more advice?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:02:03
It makes them feel superior while they make the same mistakes those before them did. But it's different this time... it really is.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:23:57
You're never touching a woman.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:10:56
No they aren't, no they won't, and the internet was tangible to be used FOR something. Right now bitcoin is a thought project you all got gamed in to believing means more than it is. It's like investing in the idea of transmitting data through wires, instead of the wires and computers and industries that create them. One has a tangible value, one will expire once the idea is copied.
Also... if your country bans it, say good bye to all your money unless you plan on ordering all your groceries to deliver from Japan.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:55:04
Betting on advertising of blockchain services? People using Bitcoin in Korea as regular currency to the point travelers would as well?
You've never actually been to Korea have you? I ask that knowing you'll probably insist you have even though you haven't.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:56:07
Yes, because dollars are what you need to buy things if you leave your house.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:33:28
Of course, a lot of people aren't equipped to handle wealth... and where it might suck that only a few have it. The reality is most people would fuck themselves with it, and we likely wouldn't be where we are with civilization if they had it.
Some people are better at financing good ideas than having them, some people are better at having good ideas than being able to finance them.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:40:22
Well we weren't speaking to eachother, and what i said upset you to the point that you thought whining to me about it was going to somehow change anything.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:50:58
Because it's not tied to goods or services, and requires no real investment or labour to create. So the entire market is based on speculation, but there's nothing tangible to speculate on but price.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:04:19
Didn't like being ridiculed in your last post, so decided for a second time around?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:20:14
You just lost some more after the crypto you invested dropped again today :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:52:34
Looking at numbers on a computer screen is as good as eating.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:56:59
What have you used it to buy? This is a serious question.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:30:42
If you're looking for a woman's opinion on aesthetics, on reddit in the bitcoin sub is not where you're going to find it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:29:29
You have a lot of friends who choose not to save money then. Anyone can open one even if their employer doesn't provide one. That's called a perk at your job, not a right to everyone working.
It's up to them to decide to save for the future.
Who cares if it represents a problem, that's the world we live in. Learn to play within those rules, manage your expectations, and you'll come out ok. Think there's any way to suddenly generate a buttload of cash with no skill or work involved means you gambling on luck... plain and simple.
You have as many odds of winning the lottery as you do picking a financial winner on no real capital investment.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:03:53
I thought i just established that wading through your history is tiresome.
I'll assume the dodging of the question means nowhere.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:10:34
On reddit... fine maybe it's a remote possibility, in the sub, nope sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:18:35
Yeah definitely; people would rather look for some kind of organised villain holding them down than accept that the world is just random, and that sometimes random can turn out badly for them regardless of the good they do.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:00:37
so where would you buy like milk from with bitcoin? Your history seems just filled with you internet yelling at people about how great bitcoin is.
No real like info.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:10:50
Yeah there really aren't lessons on how not to be a mark, aside from being taken.
Even then some people will still double down.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:27:06
You gotta take a verification pic like a camgirl.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:39:10
I think you should call an ambulance, you seem to be suffering a stroke.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:33:13
Neither. A slow bleed out to death, after all those wall street guys lose the money from the contracts and proceed to liquid their remaining assets. Then the market will return to the nerds and a normalization/stagnation in price.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:06:26
There isn't that much controversy though, this is what happens when you immerse yourself so deeply in a concept that you lose track of the fact that everyone on the outside is like "meh". You get so embroiled in the euphoria that you ignore any and all outside information that doesn't fit with your narrative.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:11:34
I'm not the one asking for investing advice from people that already burned you on bad investing advice.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:22:01
I saw your reply btw.
You don't even know what a 401k is do you?
Log off the internet a few months, i think you've had enough... it's rotting your brain.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:22:56
Well yeah but i mean, we have those villains in the current age group as well. Shkreli's a great example. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:03:49
It's like they think saying it on reddit will make it come true.
It's like a super nerdy version of The Secret.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:24:50
No you don't, you just make stuff up on the internet to feel like you matter to the world.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:17:01
Which of these places have you personally bought a beer using bitcoin from?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:11:03
lol you think this isn't how bitcoin works as well?
If you have lots of money, it makes money. Doesn't matter what kind of money it is.
Basic laws of compound interest apply to all currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:58:51
Because there's a lot of computer geeks there. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:09
Why do you come here? Is your aim to find people to join you in a collective fantasy and cry like a little baby anytime someone who doesn't drink the koolaid shows up to inject a little reality in your life? You need to find a more productive(and less financially irresponsible) way to spend your free time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:32
So you're just saying this stuff then? You don't like have any proof?
A grocers website that says "bitcoin accepted" just your anecdotal "i say so, so it's true"?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:28:38
no it isn't.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:52:04
Where did you get anger out of anything i've said?
Is that how you make yourself feel better? He's making perfect sense... oh but he's just angry at bitcoin so can't be right?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:43:04
You're never touching a woman.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:01:46
You have really drank the koolaid huh?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:42:00
It's not bad, that's a decent income and you could build a solid retirement fund just putting away a 100-200 bucks a month in something a lot more secure. You just seem to imply you guys haven't really been saving much month to month, so you're not sitting on like 50k capital to start with.
You're not going to make buttloads of money without buttloads of money invested. That's how compound interest works, you don't start seeing massive gains until you start saving a lot more money.
Just google "couch potato investing" it's safer for the long term, and you won't have daily heart attacks watching the market hoping for the luck to swing your way. If you ask me bitcoin's ship has sailed, the rich got in, bought large swaths, then sold and made money. Everyone on this sub is full of shit for the most part on their gains.... because really if they'd gotten loaded they wouldn't be on reddit constantly talking about it. They'd be living their loaded lives.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:23:51
For people with no importance to feel important?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:08:21
I think you've had too much internet, it's starting to rot your brain.
Bitcoin isn't changing anything, other than the balance sheets for all the guys sitting on massive piles of the stuff. Meanwhile people on Reddit watch their family savings evaporate in to an industry not based on goods or services while they spend their day screaming about how bitcoin is the solution to their problem of laziness.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:45:38
Financial literacy is only a secret to those who don't want to learn. There's literally libraries filled with thousands upon thousands of books you could check out completely free of charge if you really wanted to take the time to learn about it.
I'm sure the rich force us to be lazy and not do that too right through some bizarre chemtrail conspiracy or some other horse shit too right?
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:30:18
You're not helping yourself any. Here's where you laugh it off and let it go.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:38:25
I'm sure this reply seemed real sharp in your head.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:43:44
So am i. Like it's a pretty basic one.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:34:16
Credentials? The fuck you goin' on about?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:42:09
If you don't understand the basic fundamentals of investing, why would you think you know well enough to manage your own portfolio of investments?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:19:47
Your mom isn't your "landlord" 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:23:04
How seriously you took that joke is more telling than the words you used to reply to it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:24:36
I wasn't being a dick, it just seems like a lot of you get pretty offended over being asked if you even understand what it is you're doing.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:28:32
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:56:22
I asked a simple question too.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:33:41
I figured your answer was going to be comically along the lines of "yeah i know i'm not an accountant, but i talked to one" so i deleted the question to help you safe face admitting you aren't in any way certified to give tax advice... Let alone quit your job to do so.
