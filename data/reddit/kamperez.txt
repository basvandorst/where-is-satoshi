Exactly. No one says gold is too expensive to invest in because it's $14K per lb. If you want to invest $500, buy 500(ish) mBTC. When the value goes up 10%, so does the value of your investment. Everything else is semantics.

My thoughts exactly. Remeber that a corporation is not really a "thing." It is a legal fiction. The "legal" part implies reference to some "law." You must incorporate under the laws of a particular gov't, BTC doesn't have any laws with regard to incorporation. More importantly, even if there were laws on this, the governments you're doing business with would have to recognize them, usually by treaty. That's not going to happen.
If you do business through this "corporation" in the U.S. and an issue arises, you will be sued personally. Any references to a corporate structure will fail, because any foreign corporation must also incorporate in the U.S. to be recognized here. Now, I'm a lawyer, but not a corporate lawyer, so I can't speak as to the nuances. For example, there may be treaties between the US and certain foreign countries that would prevent the exercise of jurisdiction over you for doing business in the US, and divert that to your corporation. This definitely won't apply in your case because the blockchain has no diplomatic relations with the U.S. So you see, what you've create here is essentially nothing, a fictional legal fiction.
On another note, I would not try to sell any of those shares you've created. Your articles of incorporation reference "applicable statute" governing dissolution and indemnification. There is no applicable statute. When this thing goes south, you're going to be in some serious hot water.

If we are at 1% penetration and 10 years away from reaching the peak, then the current valuation of BTC is on point. If penetration is higher or we are closer to peak, the BTC is currently undervalued and you should buy, because the price will increase.
That's what the chart says, I make no claims as to the accuracy of this information.

I tried that, but a swarm of bees came at me out of nowhere!

Perhaps, but: 'Murica!
