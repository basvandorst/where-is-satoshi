The OP is self funding a way to make bitcoin and minecraft more fun, not to give you a part-time job playing minecraft.

Why the fuck didn't they send out an email? I get an email from bitfloor every other day for every little thing but they couldn't tell me this!? I have to find out when I randomly log in today and see that everything is frozen. I have over $3K USD in there, wtf do I do now?

Porn, sex toys, cam shows, used panties, pretty much anything you don't want on your credit card statement is an opportunity for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:13:49
Yup. Sell at the peak, ignore bitcoin for a couple days, buy back in.

I wrote my own. I just used  and interfaced with my existing Conky installation. I don't see myself switching/ Mine is perfect for me because I wrote it for me :)
EDIT: It looks like yours is Windows only and closed source, is that right?

There are other sites like [BlackMarketReloaded]( and also products are shipped by users and not the site. Shutting down the site (if even possible) would only be a hickup. It's like shutting down MegaUpload to stop piracy, ya, like that did anything.

I thought he was trying to say the first polished stamps as a way to say the first stamps that were well done. Which also implies that they might not be real stamps but just nice proof of concepts.

If Bitcoin crashed I'd also buy a ton more coins. I just want to sell my existing ones at a high value before that happens :)

Great point.

Are there going to be orphaned bitcoins? If I sent bitcoins in the last hour or two will they disappear forever!?

Piracy and drugs are illegal but the piratebay and silkroad are doing fine.

I hope you're joking. I happen to like the Unity engine a lot so that has forced me to write full games in C but its a far cry from the best language ever.

On bitfloor It dropped from over $50 to under $40 in an hour. I'm pissed my transaction didn't get confirmed fast enough for me to sell at $50.

This needs more heat? Most companies don't accept bitcoin. I'd say this requires exactly the same amount of heat as everything else.

Bitfloor has been nothing short of perfect for me, even during the latest traffic spikes.

This is bitcoin we're talking about. The whole point is that these bots could send their profit to a master account. The master account might not even use Mt. Gox.

I can buy a Sasha Grey Deep Throat masturbation toy on there? That actually makes a lot of sense. I'm surprised there aren't more adult stores that accept bitcoin for people who want to protect their privacy.

and drugs. Don't forget drugs,

Exactly! 
In normal currency trading you worry about the entity controlling the country. If Russia invades Poland, I'm not going to be investing in Złoty.
Jmdugan's comment only touched on the things which would disrupt core Bitcoin security, but that isn't what affects Bitcoin prices. The price of Bitcoin revolves around the psychology of the users. Consumers care about where they can spend it and investors care about security and returns.
As long as you can use Bitcoin to buy drugs and gamble, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. But the price is still based around consumer confidence. I look at Bitcoin more like stocks than currency, because it changes rapidly and the price is based on what people think other people think that its worth. But it's still not an accurate model.

Linux man. I guarantee you spent 10x as long compared to if you had a GTK environment.
Also .NET means almost everything you're doing isn't cross OS compatible. The port would need to be a full rewrite and I know most *nix users would rather have a widget type app then a standalone program. So we're talking Conky, Screenlets, or Gnome/Xfce panel applets.
But hey, don't give up and keep posting updates. A couple quick criticisms on your blog.
1) It took me a a few tries to figure out where to download the program because the link is just the word "here" in a slightly lighter colour, no bold or image or anything. 
2) I really doubt most people would be comfortable with running an exe file they downloaded directly from some blog, **ESPECIALLY** when the file pertains to their bitcoins. I mean this is a closed source executable that's official distribution channel is some blog and it's target audience is people with bitcoins (presumably installed on the same machine as your ticker). You seem like a good guy, but you get why I would never install you program in a million years right?
That's all mate, hope I didn't discourage you too much. Make sure to subscribe to and come join the light side of the force.

One suggestion for the site, make the shipping info easier to see. As someone who lives in Europe, I hate creating an account, signing in, adding the item to my cart, going to check out, entering my payment info, entering my address, and then finding out its going to cost $30 to ship a $10 item to Europe.
Amazon is by far the worst about this.

How long does it take for transactions to be processed? It takes like half an hour to verify a bit coin transaction entered the blockchain

No offense, but how old are you? I'm trying to be friendly, but IIS is shit and .NET is shit. Please don't tell me you're another MSCE.
I thought you were 16-21 in which case I figured you didn't know any better and I was going to offer free hosting for your app, an invite to my private github repos, and some mentorial advice. But now I'm not sure.

Why is "Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm" ranked so high?
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:14:38
That's what I'm thinking, its gotta be a computer glitch

You should have capitalized Polish, the title was confusing.

Did you seriously just repost a reddit comment to get extra traffic for your shitty blog? You're pathetic and a leech on society.
Here's the original comment:
That guy deserves the upvotes, not this fucking loser.
