There are two parts to that. In some cases you might not care about some outside party or other chain being able to verify it. So it would be enough if all the parties managing the chain can. But, of course, interoperability between chains will be important in many cases and verifiability in that case is indeed a tricky problem. There are lots of ideas there, but there immature at this point. Should be a solvable problem though.
Of course, it's true that a big public blockchain makes that easier so for some instances that will be the better design choice.
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:07:22
Eris is a bunch of tools and a blockchain design. So them integrating Eris means it's very easy to deploy an Eris chain on their servers. Of course, this is mostly useful during the development stage, because the servers will be under Microsofts control, which kind of defeats the point of distributed control/a blockchain. But during the development and testing process it can be great because it automates a lot of the manual work a dev usually has to go through.

Thanks for the feedback shah256. I think you have a point regarding the 'soft ball questions'. We tend to outline the show by asking: What are the most interesting things to discuss? But it might add to the episodes if we specifically ask ourselves: What's the strongest criticism to the guest's viewpoint. We'll try to do that.

That's very interesting, but are you sure you're correct? I know Thomas Voegtlin well and was just talking about the block size debate with him today and he does support the increase and didn't mention these issues.
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:05:28
Yes, that's exactly right. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:07:45
The problem with this is that $6,000 is an incredibly low amount when 2,000,000 transactions are made each block. More transactions means the bitcoin price is higher and that means the incentive to attack is higher. So only $6,000 revenues per block will mean a very insecure network.
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:49:52
Good meeting you and thanks for listening! It's awesome you've been doing it for so long:) 
Okay, I get your criticism. We'll try. If you were referring to the blocksize episode, I particularly agree there. (See comment above)
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:47:02
We definitely didn't try to avoid critical points, just didn't specifically look for them. But yes, there is definitely a balance and 'on-air arguments' certainly aren't are thing.
I think you mean the episode we did with Mike Hearn. I totally understand that criticism and I also felt that we did a bad job in being balanced there. I've been trying really hard to get someone on from the other side (Greg Maxwell, Adam Back or Jeff Garzik), but all of them have been ignoring our emails. I'd still love to do that episode, just not sure with whom.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:46:19
It might work, but it's not somewhat doubtful.
Assume there is enough space in the blocks so all transactions can be included. Then miners should include all transactions that pay more than the marginal cost of including it. This might be close to zero or it might be determined by how much more slowly the transaction makes the block propagate (because of the size) and thus increase the risk for the miner of getting orphaned. So the Nash Equilibrium here is for everyone to pay fees that equal the miners marginal costs which will be very little. (In particular, it won't cover amortization of the hardware.)
The other option is that you create an artificial scarcity of space and then people have to outbid each other to get in the block. That might create more revenues for miners but it might also lead to a slow/expensive/unreliable network that nobody wants to use.
This is why Mike has brought up the idea of assurance contracts as another way to pay for the security of the network.
(By the way, I'm strongly in favor of increasing the block size limit. It's true that there are important questions unresolved about the economic viability of PoW &amp; Bitcoin, but not increasing the block size doesn't solve them and is a sure way we never even have to worry about the long term, cause there may well not be one.)
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:13:07
There is some truth to this, but it can delay Bitcoin's growth and make mainstream adoption much, much harder.
@_date: 2014-11-23 07:45:09
When people tip (e.g. in restaurants) it is generally because it is a social convention and what they do is seen by others. They know if they don't they're seen as cheap/parasitic. Nothing like that exists online. Expecting that culture and social pressure to emerge online is unrealistic and without it tipping will remain a minor sideshow.
Even if someone has the massive audience to make tipping viable, I have no doubt that there are always much more potent ways of monetization. They'd be leaving serious money on the table if they relied on tipping.
I honestly think (and our experiences running a Bitcoin podcast for close to a year supports) that the idea that tipping could replace advertising is totally delusional.

That's not true. Remittances are not net neutral. 
Think of it like this: If $104bn in remittances are made with bitcoin per year and if a remittance on average 'locks up' a Bitcoin for one week, then $2bn in bitcoin are needed to perform those transactions. This would be equivalent to a fund 'hoarding' $2bn in bitcoin and never doing anything with it.

We did a podcast episode with Ascribe CTO Trent about how the blockchain is used for ownership of digital art: 
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:06:00
The point is that Bitcoin will continue to be an interesting speculative asset in a way other currencies are not until the whole world uses Bitcoin. 
The Robert Sams Seignorage Shares would solve this with a dual-currency model. But that's not tested and working right now. Ethereum doesn't have a solution either at the moment.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:55:10
No, he actually claims that this isn't a problem that will be solved with increased liquidity.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:16:59
Exactly! But the point is that Bitcoin is simultaneously used as a speculative asset and as money. (Currently, mostly the former.) So his point is that since it will continue to be used as both, the volatility will not go away and that will hamper its usefulness as money.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:52:15
The basic idea is that there are two currencies. One is a stable cryptocurrency, the other is volatile. 
The money supply of the stable one increases if demand increases and decreases if demand decreases. Then the value would be held constant, which is obviously great for transactions. The volatility is absorbed by the volatile coin, which gains in value if the stable currency is used more and loses if it isn't.
This way you can have both the speculative and transactional uses of Bitcoin, but they are separated so speculation doesn't negatively impact volatility &amp; thus adoption. It's the best of both worlds, but as mentioned hasn't been implemented yet and there are some aspects that aren't trivial.

95% of who? Bitcoin users? Core developers? (What's the definition of that even?) 95% would also mean that just 6 out 100 could block any change.

Good point and I agree that sidechains could help somewhat. But even sidechains requires changes to the Bitcoin protocol so who decides if those happen? And the governance question at least pertaining the main chain would remain.

I don't think you could use voting by full nodes as meaningful, since it's cheap to spin up 1000s of nodes to change the voting. The only voting I could see is people voting with their coins. (i.e. 1 satoshi = 1 vote) And that would certainly be a radical departure. I'm not sure how it could be done technically either.
(I think letting miners decide the course with their hashing power is also flawed, since we can't assume their interests will always coincide with maintaining the system long-term.)

One minor thing, why do you think that Gavin would need a money transmitter license if he was a BDFL?

With governance I mean the process by which decisions are reached. Bitcoin has always had a governance process, whether it was explicitly discussed or not.
Maybe one could describe the current governance process as 'Change happens when the 5 core maintainers reach consensus. One can become a new core maintainer if the existing 5 agree. Whoever disagrees has to fork the code and convince the network to switch'. Is that what we want?

What I found most remarkable is how high the cost of accepting credit cards is. We often think of the ~3% and the issue with that is that it doesn't leave enough to give a significant discount to consumers and still make economic sense for merchants. But when the real cost is 8-12% as he pointed out, then it makes total sense for merchants to give people a 5% discount for paying with bitcoin and I think that will be enough for average people to jump through the hoops of using Bitcoin and put up with the volatility.
So I became quite a bit more bullish on the success of Bitcoin as a payment system during the interview.
(The only caveat here is that of those 8-12% a significant portion will be fixed costs that the merchant bears regardless. So the real savings for the merchant in accepting the Bitcoin payment will be somewhere in between 1% and those 7-11%, if we assume accepting btc costs 1%)

To be honest, I still feel that fears of hard forks are overblown. I indeed learned a lot from Eric and enjoyed the conversation a lot. I think segregated witness is pretty awesome. If it was up to me, I would be in favor of an immediate hard fork increase to 4MB or so and adding segregated witness as well.
That being said, the interview made me more optimistic than I had been in a long time about Bitcoin. Maybe with segregated witness it will be possible to have a good pace of innovation even if the current hostility against hard forks prevails.

Excellent question.
First, there is a high chance that SegWit will get activated via the NYA/SegWit2x proposal before August 1. In that case, there will be no UASF on August 1.
But let's assume that doesn't happen. Then there may indeed be a UASF after August 1. The important thing to recognize about UASF is that the amount of mining power supporting it is crucial for its success. Let's say only 10% of the hash rate support UASF. Then a block will only be mined every 100 minutes on the UASF chain. The capacity will be just 10% of what Bitcoin currently has. In other words, the chain will be practically useless until the next difficulty adjustment. And the other chain, will be so far ahead that the UASF chain will never catch up. In short, a very low hash rate means that the UASF chain will have no chance of survival. Only one Bitcoin would likely survive and it wouldn't be the UASF one.
If the hash rate supporting UASF is above 50% then it could actually work reasonably safely. Miners mining other blocks would get orphaned, but the UASF chain would be the longest, so the minority of miners would probably capitulate and we would have a UASF Bitcoin. 
If the hash rate supporting UASF would be significant but no majority (&gt;30% and &lt;50%), then there would be a high chance of ending up with two different Bitcoins. The UASF chain would be slower (and thus shorter), but the capacity would still be sufficient for the network to be semi-usable until the next difficulty adjustment. If the UASF chain managed to gain more traction and would come close to catching up to the other chain, the other chain would likely hard fork (e.g.  and the chains would never come together again. Else all transactions would be wiped out and the mining rewards lost.
Overall, there is a very high risk with UASF that we would end up with several competing Bitcoins. This would certainly crash the price of Bitcoin, lead to a huge amount of chaos and damage the reputation of Bitcoin permanently. How one can argue that this is somehow the "safe" path is also something that puzzles me.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:07:15
Luke's argument that hash rate is irrelevant is non-sense. For UASF to activate a block has to be mined, so obviously you need hashing power for that. Then for that chain to continue, you continue need hashing power. 
The only scenario in which the UASF chain could survive without significant hashing power support is if they hard fork and change to a different PoW.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:22:26
You're seriously clueless. Somebody needs to mine a UASF block for it to activate.

This is a short story competition. The prize is payable in bitcoin: 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:53:03
That's incorrect. The UASF miners don't just need to find one block, they need to find another difficulty adjustment period's worth of blocks before Nov 15. Else BIP148 expires and SegWit doesn't even get activated on the UASF chain. (That is unless they HF to force a difficulty adjustment or change PoW)
@_date: 2015-02-05 09:32:48
Thanks! Here is the video link: 
Let me try to answer the questions:
1) I believe the sidechain creator can set that to whatever way they want. So having a 100/1 ratio or 1/1 ratio or whatever is no problem.
2) Yes, they have their own blockchain. That's kind of the idea of it. (Though with this block extension idea - see video, maybe that's relaxed a little.) Regarding the PoW of the sidechain, that's a great question and we'll address it with them. It's also an interesting question if a sidechain could have PoS (though Adam &amp; Greg don't think highly of PoS)
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:37:41
Yes that's correct. If 10 sidechains coins are issued per btc, then the there can theoretically only ever be 210m sidechains coins.
The merge mining means that there can be no block reward like in bitcoin. There are different ways of rewarding miners. The first is that miners just receive the transaction fees of the sidechain. Another possibility is demurrage. So for example, every block some small percentage of the coins held on the sidechain go to the miners. (So each block your balance might decrease from 1000000 sidechain coins to 999999, etc.)
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:05:02
The thing is if the hash rate on UASF chain is less than 16% SegWit would never even activate on the chain. There is a deadline for SegWit to activate and at &lt;16%, the UASF will not mine blocks fast enough to complete the activation period in that time.
Of course, it's true that even with 15% you can continue some chain, but I don't think it has any chance of survival.

@_date: 2015-02-05 11:44:51
I do think you're missing something. In the end Bitcoin is the ultimate arbiter of the scarcity of the bitcoin monetary base. So any bitcoin sidechain will always be 'subordinate' to Bitcoin and the security of a sidechain can never be higher than the security of Bitcoin itself.
If people develop very powerful sidechains, they might well surpass Bitcoin in terms of usage, but that would only solidify the central position of Bitcoin.

Yes, I think a zerocash sidechain is one of the projects they are most excited about.

Yes, will be out on Monday. We'll be editing it as well so there won't be the gaps and interruptions

Indeed! Indeed!

It seems you can't even pay with bitcoin. Not exactly a good sign for a bitcoin conference...

This is an interesting idea and theoretically it could be huge for bitcoin. I also think that raising the money would be possible. After all there is substantial wealth in the bitcoin community and increased publicity will increase that. 
But...there is no way that the TV companies would air a bitcoin commercial. The banks, government etc would simply say 'no, no' and that would be the end of the story.

Just withdrew some LTC from there. Everything was perfect and fast.

I agree regarding hedge funds, but VCs have strict contracts with their LPs and there is no way that they would be allowed to buy bitcoins.

It's practically impossible to operate a bitcoin ATM without a bank account. You will need an account to deposit the cash put into the machine, transfer it to an exchange account and then repurchase the bitcoins. 
If you don't have a bank account, you'd need to do cash purchases of bitcoins which would be inconvenient, doesn't scale and you'd end up taking large currency risks.
