Well, it's really none of your business and I certainly won't go into any details on reddit but I'll shed a little light on some of the hats I do wear in support of our 5,000+ employees and roughly 350,000+ daily users.
I currently hold RHCSA, RHCE, CCNA, CEH, CCSP, CDOP, AWS Solutions Arch, VCP5-DCV and MCSE certs. 
Some of my responsibilities include systems, security, network arch, DBA, webdev etc....
I wear more hats here then I have time to start listing off. I may not work specifically in crypto currencies however, our environments share many similarities. Every environment is unique but that doesn't mean that an observer from the outside would have absolutely no idea the types of challenges that others might be facing. With more than 20 years experience in enterprise systems, just by looking at the amount of manpower they have available and the types of technologies powering their systems I can gather a pretty good idea about the time frame they should be looking at to implement segwit and from my perspective it appears they're intentionally dragging their feet. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:06:44
I'm certainly guilty of this and honestly my own experience tells me I should know better. The hours upon hours of meetings and sometimes even meetings about other meetings is a subtle reminder that we all have other factors besides technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:34:43
Calm down there skippy. I work in large scale enterprise IT so I do have some understanding of challenges that can arise from such a change. My only issue is that we are coming up on nearly 6 months and coinbase is still in the planning phase while other exchanges like bitstamp and kraken have already deployed segwit. It looks like at this point they will be many months behind most others.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:59:36
I would recommend you take a look at some of the various crypto mining subs. There's usually one for every crypto coin.
Just a quick non-technical run down so you at least have a starting point. Over the last year it's been far more profitable to simply buy bitcoin and hodl than it is to buy equipment and then put it to work mining. This is mainly only true for Bitcoin and maybe 2 or 3 other coins. There are several ways available to mine depending on how you want to mine and which coin(s) you choose. Some like bitcoin, litecoin and dash can no ONLY be mined with expensive dedicated ASIC mining machines. Some are mined through proof of stake which is essentially the same principal as earning interest in a savings account. Some are mined by CPU only like vericoin. Another option is proof of capacity or hard drive mining which currently is limited to burstcoin. Some can be mined with CPU or GPU's and others like ethereum can only be mined with GPU's. Basically you'll need one or more of the following if you want to mine any coin and it be profitable.
* CPU i7 6700k or greater. You can also build a farm of single board computers for CPU mining using the Odroid XU4 or Raspberry pi 3's. 
* GPU nvidia 750ti or greater
* a large amount of one of the proof of stake coins
* 25 TB or more of HDD space that you can dedicate to mining.
* Current generation ASIC miner

You certainly made that abundantly clear.
OP doesn't know about bitcoin but claims it's a bubble by trying to compare it to things that aren't anything like bitcoin. The problem OP, is that you don't have anything historically available to compare bitcoin to so just by making a comparison to something like gold or tulips your assumptions are automatically wrong. 
Bitcoin is as revolutionary for finances as the internet was for communication. Nobody here knows how the future will play out and how new technologies coming to bitcoin such as lightening network or atomic swaps will affect day to day use. Bitcoin transactions might be so fast and cheap in the future that there's no need for any other form of currency or it may take on a completely different role where it ends up being used entirely for consensus purposes and a store of verifiable value. Who knows? The only thing I do know for certain is this is revolutionary and will shape the future in ways yet unseen.

Most miners who mine alt coins I would imagine like myself are doing so on multipools that use profit switching algos to automatically mine whatever coin is currently the most profitable like nicehash, zpool, granatgas etc...They never hold or receive the alt coin they're mining. Instead the alt coins are instantly exchanged for the crypto of the miners choice by bots. I ASIC mine both sha256 and scrypt on multipools and get paid in bitcoin for my hashing power. I earn more bitcoin per day than if I were to join a pool like slush and mine bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:04:58
About $4 per day more for each ASIC machine. It quickly adds up to a lot more when you add all my machines together.

Most of the FUD from Dr. Chen Wu demonstrates a clear lack of understanding which I honestly don't find surprising. Many financial specialist try to compare crypto to other more traditional markets or investments but this isn't anything like those markets and will always behave differently. He clearly doesn't understand where bitcoin has value or why.


This is also clear disinformation and demonstrates a lack of research on the topic. I mean honestly, no value other than supply and demand? Did you really write that with a straight face?


Nothing with the recent fork happened overnight. This also wasn't value or money created virtually from thin air. Real people have real investments in both hardware, electricity costs, hundreds of thousands of man hours and real work backing and supporting both of these networks. With labor, capital and investment comes value that's based on many real tangible and intangible forces. 


Maybe for centrally controlled ethereum this is true. 


This is true for everything in life not just crypto currencies. 
Honestly if you want to give accurate information to your readers, spend a little more time learning about the subject and don't take information as truth from those who aren't involved and only have a small grasp at the general concept. I understand that reporters today are paid for clicks, not for reporting accurately so we really don't expect much more than what this piece delivers. The truth is that the future of money is changing and we will all be better off because of it.

Just be aware that it will be a long time before 7nm can hit the consumer market strictly due to the fact that 7nm photolithography machines are just now coming out for companies to purchase. The first people to have access to these will be large established chip makers like Intel and amd. It will be many more months before others get their hands on these multimillion dollar machines and then many months after that for development, testing, design etc...I wouldn't count on 7nm asic before close to 2019.

I would argue that while bitcoin mining might be consuming a lot of electricity it's also become far more efficient in terms of hashes per kWh. I would also argue that regardless of how wasteful people may think this is, the people using that electricity are paying for and choosing to use their electricity in this manner. Simple supply and demand.

The most energy efficient coins are those that don't have to be mined at all or those that mine by proof of stake only. Just seems like most people don't really want those coins, probably for multiple reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:42:26


This is something that practically the entire burst community has been screaming for and seems to be in high demand. Thousands of burst miners are looking for another proof of capacity/proof of storage (whatever you want to call it) coin since burst has become somewhat toxic over the last year. Burst has a transaction volume that varies anywhere from 40-150 bitcoins daily. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:44
I'm not disagreeing, I simply pointed out that the total number of hashes per kWh created is more efficient than in the past. I understand that the number of hashes on the network doesn't matter in terms of difficulty and block times but one could argue that more hashing power could be an indicator of confidence since it's essentially proof of invested capital and network support and with more confidence comes higher prices. There seems to be a correlation between hashing power and price. Take litecoin and dash as recent examples. As soon as ASIC hit litecoin the price almost immediately skyrocketed as a result, the same appears to be happening with dash. Is this directly the result of ASIC and hashrates rising exponentially? I'm not 100% positive but the time line seems to match the correlation.

Your not wrong, just wanted to clarify that this is now mostly the fault of exchanges not enabling segwit for use. As soon as we can get most wallets and exchanges to actually use segwit transactions we will all get some much needed relief.

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:29:36


It very well could be. I would say that the vast majority of people have only ever heard of Bitcoin. Many of those people still believe it's a scam because the only news they've ever heard about bitcoin is associated with ransomware, silkroad or that Isis uses it. This is the typical response I get from most people. Out of all the people that have actually heard of Bitcoin only a small fraction of those are even aware that altcoins exist most think there is just Bitcoin. There's almost 7 billion people on this planet and probably less than 10 million are aware of crypto. If Bitcoin fails then you can bet the majority of media outlets will be screaming and pointing saying, I told you so, Bitcoin is a scam! Since all altcoins seem to be tied to Bitcoin in one way or another you should expect the demise of Bitcoin to bring the crypto world back to the very beginning.

I think the correction we'll be looking at is a pull back from $10K with the price hanging around $5K for a few months before this train takes off again. I doubt bitcoin will ever fall below $3K again in the next 2 years.

I don't think we will see a correction that last more than 30-40 days until we reach $100K which I think will happen in the next 3 years.

I don't think OP's bet is entirely unrealistic. He probably could have waited things out a bit and bought in at a little lower price but who knows what's going to happen. We could end up back below $1K. I fully believe we will see a $10K bitcoin sometime in the next 5 years or possibly sooner. I also believe we will see $100K sometime before 2030 but I expect there to be some big dips along the way.

That's about the same time period I started buying and holding. Unfortunately I could really only afford to buy 1 coin about every other month during that time and then half a coin at a time as the price continued to rise. I have several whole coins now but not nearly enough to pay of anything substantial like a mortgage yet. I believe we will get there in just a few short years though. It kills me though as I started reading about and becoming interested in the idea of bitcoin when there were around $2 each but stupidly I didn't buy any like I should have.
