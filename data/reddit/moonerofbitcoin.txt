Here is some info but not about fees. It's about setting up a LN node on a RPi. This is going to be so dope.

Check out opendime\[.\]com.
There is a battery powered reader that can confirm the balance on an OD Stick. In this scenario you hand a stick to a vendor, she reads the stick and confirms the balance. She hands over the goods/service and the buyer hands her the stick. No network needed and the reader can fit in your pocket and uses almost no power.

Not much better out in Cali. People are pissed everywhere. There was a mini riot at the Ft. Lauderdale airport over 9 flights being cancelled. Move out to the country, much better.

Well of course it's going to drop. That's OK as it will recover at the same time as raising overall support price. Shit, I'd be worried if the thing never dropped as that ain't normal.

To be fair, I don't know offhand of a wallet that offers that functionality and I understand the usefulness of such a thing. I'm sure something exists like that. Seems dumb not to have that functionality in many wallets.
