Also may I suggest donating to Wikipedia donation fund?
Every year I feel like the barely are able to afford running based on the ads they send out during donation time. I feel for the amount they have done for the internet and value they provide for education and information on pretty much everything. They may be something you could look at alternative to a charity

Because it's $15 to make a transaction....


Prove it.


Hurr durr I'm too delusional to see Bitcoin has some scaling issues to work out
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:18:55
I actually just did this days ago and I'm so glad I did
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:09:35


Exactly. Watching the market for the past few days throughout the day, it's fluctuated from $4250 down to $3900ish. That's not stable at all, but then again, good for day traders
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:27:46


How about a long fiat buck?
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:20:55
Neat. I was here for this

Hey it's me your brother
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:05:01
But low, hodl high 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:52:13
I think it'll drop to $3700 minimum over time then slowly climb back up. It seems like $4400 was the peak, and now it's correcting, holding steady for now at $4100. There's a lot more sells going out right now then buys so I still think it has some room to drop today.
I'm setting up my buy orders now in case it does happen to drop below $4000 tonight
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:03:54
I mean. You can call it a crash, but I think the market is just very unstable right now so it's hard to tell if it's actually a crash. We dropped to $3800 over night and now we're back at $4100.
The next couple of days should tell us if we're in a crash
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:56:07
Well I can't help it that I didn't have money the one week bitcoin decides to climb $1000
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:53:17
Ugh, still annoyed they devalued the amg name by slapping it on every trim that options the amg package
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:10:50
Hey, if you bought in at $3700 like I did you'll still make a pretty penny. It's all about long term, that's the game I'm playing
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:15:14


I have $60 in bitcoin up from $50. Do I count?

The value of the token decided by the market as well as usage in real world markets (Venezuela, Brazil, etc), Darknet markets, and legitimate markets (steam, etc.)

Congrats to all the hodlr's who have kept this thriving community alive since it's inception.
Also those gains are probably nice.
The real question is, where's that dude who bet it wouldn't pass $10,000 and has to eat some balls
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:42:20
It's a God awful chart, the x axis goes by year and they decided to only start year 1 at 2017? Wtf

You call it a bad investment, yet it's made people millionaires? If I invested in Bitcoin just from last year, I'd be sitting on around $9,000 of profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:56:34


As a pc gamer, the fact you don't understand that bitcoin mining doesn't use gpu's is hilarious. Go yell at @_date: 2017-11-29 07:53:52
Go to their website and make an account with them

No please. My dream of owning 1 whole btc will never come true at that rate
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:01:45
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:13:16
If Bitcoin could just stop increasing in price until I land my full-time job later this year, that would be great.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:19:55
Who says I'm complaining? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:40:16
Which should tell you something about the current market. Bitcoin is in for a correction, nobody knows when, but I'm weary with investing now after the plateau around $4300-$4400 we had for a week.
Stable prices are what gives me confidence to invest so I don't see an immediate loss in investment even though I know the price of bitcoin is going up long term 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:44:23


Me too thanks
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:20:12
Oh, I'm definitely not saying btc won't continue to grow. It will. I meant that investing when at an ATH is a very dumb move because any small fluctuation will lose you money.
If you're in it for the long term, then investing in btc is great, but I personally would never invest more than maybe $1000 at its current price. I feel we're in for a correction, we've gone like 400% in the past 6 months alone and only had 1 stagnation.

Welcome to the world of crypto, where coins are the new religion and you have to follow the principles of each coin and defend them to the death.
Or at least this is 90% of the people in it
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:44:23


Me too thanks
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:40:48


Bought at $4000 then $4200. I'm now at a net positive for the first time in weeks. I call this a success
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:37:52
Every week I have the same reaction when Bitcoin does it's mini flash sale.
"Oh wow, is it friday already?"
*Bitcoin drops $400*

TIL Bill doesn't want to make money
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:42:39
It's not exactly a cheap space to enter into. It would be akin to competing with Intel and Amd, the sheer billions required for just the initial capital and chip manufacturing is massive 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:06:49


Jesus christ, I wish I had even a tenth of that to spend. I'm in college and have a decent chunk in btc and some alts. And I've made something like 60% profit over the past 3 months, but just thinking if I had more money to invest makes me itch a little.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:03:50
Not to mentuon this is the absolute worst point to invest in bitcoin since it's at its all time high
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:09:39


I'd be interested in seeing some sort of metric that shows how much go to these scams. I mean, if you're using something like shapeshift, you probably have enough know how to not click on the ad google listing
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:27:39
I'm panicing by buying as much bitcoin as possible because I don't think we'll ever see bitcoin this low for a while
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:31:51
3 in that color is what I meant, not the model itself 
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:11:27


You mean a clearance on purchases of Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:17:34
The average going rate for a lambo from gotham exotics (using them because they have a bunch of places country wide) is usually around $1500 for 2 days for a fairly new model, aventador/huracan. 
A private party has rented out to me personally for $1200 for two days for a Gallardo spyder in matte white, only 1 of 3 in existence I believe. So it's definitely possible to find a good deal for them. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:22:24
Yes. Matte white was a special run color Lamborghini did for the Gallardo spyder and only produced 3 cars in the particular color. This makes them very rare and command a higher rental price than just a regular gallardo
