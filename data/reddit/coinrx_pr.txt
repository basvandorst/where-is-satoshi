**CoinRx.com is NOT a scam**
Over the past two weeks there have been reports that all Indian pharma drop shippers have had problems shipping or packages stuck in Indian customs. You can read about it here:
This is partially true. Inspections have taken place throughout the country. Most of the the bad actors have been shutdown, however the licensed ethical operators (who follow all the laws and regulations) have also been negatively affected. They are assessing the 'damage' and re-shipping any orders which have not been delivered or seen sufficient tracking movement. It will take a few more days to determine which customers been affected, clear up the backlog, and return to normal shipping times.
We have no intention of scamming anyone nor any plans to leave this business. In fact, over the next few weeks we plan on adding over 1000 new pharma products and the ability to pay with various altcoins (Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc).
We appreciate the patience of all our customers and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us anytime.
P.S. please message us your customerID so that we can re-ship your order.
**tl;dr Don't worry, CoinRx.com is not going out of business and is commited to helping customers get their orders.**

The same medicines sold in a US pharmacy and manufactured in India. 
Did you know Dr. Reddy's is an Indian pharmaceutical company listed on the NYSE?
