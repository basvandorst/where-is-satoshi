That's a lot of work to bust a personal user.  And if you're buying this way, you probably have education and a job, and cops prefer not to bust civilians.

I took [this screenshot]( at 12PM EST (GMT-5). It took a while for me to find them - this is from the most popular weed page. Definitely looks targeted to popular items. My shipping buttons seemed unaffected, though I didn't attempt a purchase.

When the Feds cracked down on online poker, they attacked payment processors. 
 I imagine they'll attack the entrance and exit nodes like BitInstant, Dwolla and US banks which hold checking accounts into which bitcoin withdrawals are made.
Edit: IIRC the Federal Attorney General for the New York district and maybe a couple others played whack-a-mole with payment processors for a while. You could get money in w/many debit cards (maybe MC, but not VISA?), but cashing out became a real hassle at times. There were backlogs for periods when no cashout processing companies were available. Some banks (BOA?) stopped accepting checks from these cashout processors. Then finally, some PokerStars (which company's servers are legally located on the Isle of Man) execs were indicted. I think one was arrested in O'Hare airport. Then the big poker sites said 'enough is enough' and changed their policy to 'no US players'. :(
The above is a player's recollection of how that happened. [Link to wikipedia's Online Poker - Legality](

Bitcoin is used exclusively by débrouillardes. Ain't no silkroad merchants paying taxes.  It'll be interesting though if foolproof phone apps make it possible to pay a kid to mow your lawn w/bitcoins.

We're talking about different charts.  The one I linked is just price and volume.  The one you linked is cool, but not a depth chart.
@_date: 2012-07-20 01:35:46
Well, there's no price over time data, but the bar form of the depth chart ls interesting for visualizing where the demand is built up along the price axis.  Looks like there's a lot of demand for bitcoins at $7.50 and even more people who want to sell bitcoins at $9.  
@_date: 2012-08-11 08:14:27
BTW, I used to play PokerStars all the time and often paid the light bill with it.  Now that's not an option in the US, are there any Bitcoin friendly poker sites with significant volume?  I seem to remember finding one once with like 12 players on it, so that's not really what I'm looking for.

I'll pay you a fee to borrow a bunch of bitcoins today.  I'll return them to you in 3 months.  I'll take $5000 worth now.  I'll take the lowest fee bid.

Yes, we get you're a genius. But, for the layman, is it better than not encrypting and pretty easy?

I am not Vanessa Selbst. And I think she spells it a little different.  Maybe because she's fslexic. Also I'm pretty sure you're the first person to notice the reference.    I still really wanna gamble with bitcoins, though.  But poker only, really.  Maybe sports and politics too.  It would be cool if Intrade took Bitcoins.  I'm not sure, but I imagine there are shady online casinos with bullshit games who'll take your coins.  
Edit: You've inspired me to email PS about bitcoin and start talking it up on the 2+2 forums.  I'm doing it now.  Oh, and PS is famous for excellent email communication  and CS.  Y'all should do it too. Stars rocks, they just need to start taking coins, dammit.
P.S.  Some articulate person knowledgeable about bitcoin should write a form letter for we US players to send to Stars and Cake to convince them they should take bitcoin.
Edit Edit:  A quick 2+2 search turned up [Seals with Clubs]( which is no PS but may be promising.

No, no. The rake is higher than 2%. *Skillful* players have an edge, but overall EV for poker is more than 2% negative.

I used to play quite a bit on PokerStars (I won $4,700 in a big tournament once). I've emailed their customer support twice about bitcoin. They're famous for excellent CS, so I'm sure real humans read them, but I got a brush-off both times.

Drop the quotes. Poker, objectively, empirically, *is a game of skill*. Watch old episodes of the final table of the World Series of Poker.  The best players consistently make it to the top.  [Wikipedia entry on basic strategy.](

Oh, no, I said I'll double your money if someone gives me .5 and I get my balance up to 1.5. I added my 2+2 poker forum username because I used to post there when  I was playing and I have some good history with poker-chip/money trades.  I'll probably just buy in the regular way, but sometimes poker players are friendly like that.

I think Poker Scout was citing the other poker-news site, gambling911, as the source for the information that a major site is planning to accept bitcoin. Gambling911 is not an operator of games. There are very few 'US facing' poker sites. I wonder which it is?
