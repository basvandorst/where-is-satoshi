very interesting for sure, but this concept is not very related to bitcoin.  The two primary components of Bitcoin are the Block Chain and the Transactions Formats, neither of which are displayed in the paper.

Bitcoin's popularity has grown exponentially in recent years as a new form of digital money that transcends geography and national governments. This paper describes a system for 1) Asset Issuance meaning the creation of digital property 2) and Asset Transactions meaning the exchange and trade of that property. Many of it's internal structures are derived from Bitcoin technology, thus many innovations in the Bitcoin world carry over to this platform. It is truly Peer-To-Peer, meaning there is no central server required. A very high level of transaction integrity and security can be achieved. It has several advantages over Bitcoin, namely speed of transactions and no need for 'mining'. The system is suitable for a wide range of applications, it is powerful enough to do high volume securities trading, secure enough to trade precious metals, and simple enough for Community Currency implementations. In this paper we will describe the core algorithm of Confidence Chains, in other proposals we will offer more details regarding asset issuance and related features.

how is defending yourself from a lunatic looking to defame you 'trolling?
Chris' already disproven claims are an 'official statement'?
Yes unfortunately I did work with Chris.  The reason why he's sending sock puppets on here to flame me is because I have PROOF about his activities.  Hes obsessed with destroying my reputation.
Just please read the paper if you're interested in p2p exchanges.

that would explain a great deal.  I used to follow the project back when Ryan was working on it.  We had a number of chats about the technology.  Clearly this thing is a scam, and Ryan is gagged by law.

clearly, some kind of criteria for membership must be enforced.  Satoshi recognized this problem as did Ben Laurie.
"Both Bitcoin and my alternative proposal suffer from a problem for which there is no known solution: creating consensus in a group with open, changing membership."
I would also note that I tend to beleive that many of the ideas of Community Currencies are untenable, but I maintain a neutral stance on the issue.
in Confidence Chains the identity weight function is left open for the currency designer to define.  In a sense CCs are a generalization of Bitcoin technology.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:43:47
surprised?  Is there anything of any substance whatsoever with Open Transactions?
the only thing this guy has done for well over a year is blab away about how great he is.
No one has actually implemented anything he claims his software can do.  Most of the features are half baked.  As a matter of fact, he didn't even write all the open source code!  he outsourced parts of it to India and then open sourced it in his name.
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:55:40

the COIN_DUST issue is really one of capacity.  These transactions were banned because it is thought that the network as a whole will not perform if these transactions exist.
Just to give you an idea: Bitcoin carries roughly 50k txs per day.  The NYSE carries 1.2 BILLION txs per day.
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:40:26
there is another option besides Proof Of Stake,  
Confidence Chains offers instead Distribtued Authority, and peer to peer exchanges.  It's the most suitable option for a stock exchange.  The problem with a PoS system is that there is no valid consensus on the ORDER(ie chronology) of the transactions- the order book.  Confidence Chains solves this problem.  It allows the negotiation of the blockchain according to the indenity distribution.  Many configurations are possible.  I think Color Coins are not right for stock exchanges because of capacity issues primarily.
Being that it is an altchain, any kind of transaction type is possible, including an enforced dividend type system that requies stock issuers to distribute dividends at specified intervals.  Other kinds of mechanisms are also possible eg. futures, options, derivatives, etc.  You can use Bitcoin tx formats as is.
so specifically, you could have a chain for each exchange, or even sub-chains within chains to allow for a kind of 'scoping' for asset types.  The paper was recently published and I haven't had the time yet to explain other features of the concept.

"The second type of activity involves a convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository. The administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another."
Open Transactions?  calling all OdomBots!
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:32:38
So we rely on the direct participation of the Issuer to not only honor the VALUE but also the OWNERSHIP of the assets.  That is a serious weakness of Color Coins.
Confidence Chains has none of these problems.  Actually you can trade assets without the direct authorization of the issuer.  This is a key feature.  The only system that comes close to this capability is Chaumian E-Cash - and in this case it only offers ANONYMITY, as in there is no way for the bank to know who is making the transaction.  The bank still has the ability to freeze all transactions.  Confidence Chains also mitigates this problem, **no one single node can shut down all transaction processing**.

It's not just a regular 'fuck up', it can be seriously confusing for the user if they decide to use a regular Bitcoin client with their account containing color coins and then **suddenly lose all those assets**.  That's a pretty serious **onus** you have put on the user in order for their assets to be secure.

so just curious, why would you make a statement like "Are you not worried that Open Transactions will replace the need for your product?"  if you don't even understand how it will do that?
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:28:11
what if I'm using a regular bitcoin client and it attempts to take those outputs and combine them with other outputs from totally uncolored transactions?
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:31:43
given the scale of the project it's plausible that Ryan is on some kind of retainer and required to say positive things about the technology.

@_date: 2013-06-14 14:40:57
"You definitely can do that with colored coins."
certainly this is one of the features.  But to revisit your earlier comment, we were discussing the scenario where a coin was inadvertantly DECOLORED.  Your suggestion was to **appeal to the issuer** for a replacement.  That's not a solution to this problem as far as I'm concerned.  Sorry, Alex.  :)
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:07:32
It requires the use of a special client.  There are several techniques for implementing Color Coins.  They have not been clear about what happens if I attempt to move a color coin using a regular client.  Do I lose the coloring?
I like the idea of Color Coins, but I have questions as to their viability.  I think performance and capacity are going to be serious problems.  
"He expects native colored coin support in an altcurrency before bitcoin."  This is also something that doesn't make sense in the Color Coin project.  The whole point of Color Coins is to allow the use of the *existing* block chain.  If we are in the altchain world, why don't we just redesign the Tx format?  Furthermore, why don't we just drop the whole notion of mining altogether?  It was these conclusions that led to my invention of Confidence Chains.
"Building a colored coins technology that is binary-compatible with Bitcoin will be problematic, he asserts, because of what he describes as high transaction fees."  again, Confidence Chains factors out Proof of Work, Mining, and thus transaction fees altogether(although they can be implemented if desired).  Again the PURPOSE of Color Coins was backward compatibility with the existing block chain.  If we want Peer To Peer Asset Issuance and Transactions, then Confidence Chains is a far more optimized(and elegant) solution.  It can also be used for other functions such as p2p exchanges and auctions.
the proposal covers many similar use cases: 
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:57:05
so Ryan, you are no longer involved with the project?
@_date: 2013-06-03 02:40:50
pretty sure also that the original developer Ryan Fugger is being paid to say positive things about OpenCoin and the 'new' Ripple.

Chris your little spam empire is about to come to an end.
He's actually sending sock puppets on here to claim that OT is going to replace Coinsetter?  He keeps doing this and he's going to have a rude awakening.

how will it do that?
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:48:58
I think the 'same amount of work' part is questionable here.  Seems in theory it would be more work to merge mine.
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:54:23
it looks like youre another one of his sock puppets.  In EVERY CASE, Chris attacked me first.
seriously: WHO ARE YOU?
why does it seem there is an mob of anonymous people on all these forums promoting Chris' agenda, who make dull blanket statements about how great OT is(but dont seem to understand anything about it), how wonderful Chris is, etc.  Meanwhile OT has ZERO real users?  You don't think this starts to tell another story?
did I mention that Chris is a professional Internet marketer/spammer?
Ultimately: WHERE IS ALL THE SOFTWARE CHRIS KEEPS TALKING ABOUT?  Why would people be loyal to a software platform that does precisely NOTHING?
at least once a week he announces some new great feature, but hasn't implemented even HALF of the things he's already claimed.  That's not how an open project functions.  This whole thing is going to blow up in his face, I'm just sick of this leprechaun creating all these distractions in every open information channel on Bitcoin.  He's abusing the community in the extreme.
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:31:16
Chris, who else would create an entire reddit account just to respond to my points about Open Transactions?
are you some kind of psychopath?
@_date: 2013-06-24 02:52:32
hold on there.  Was the money in a webwallet type service?  Those accounts are seizable without any kind crypto-trickery.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:00:42
why does everyone suddently want to do everything with the block chain?  It's like the Bitcoin community learned how to use a hammer, suddenly they think everything is a nail.  There are many cryptographic voting protocols out there.  You don't need, nor would you want, a block chain.
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:22:56
the basic characteristic of anonymity in Bitcoin is that:
**we know what money goes into what accounts...
but we don't know who has control of the accounts.**
so in your case we know that funds went from B to A and then to C.  Even though we don't know who might have made account A, we DO KNOW that the funds went from B to C.  We can increase the size of this chain however we cannot hide the fact of where they came from and where they went.  Ultimately ONE of those accounts will have some kind of identification associated with it.
People give out their identification all the time.  For instance Coinapult has a massive database of e-mail addresses to bitcoin addresses.  If they were to ever share this data with Google, you could put real names on many bitcoin accounts.

why do you 'highly doubt that'?   people sign gag agreements all the time. 
has anyone ever asked him candidly if he has an agreement with OpenCoin regarding what he can talk about, and what he can say about the technology?
seems to me that what Ripple is today has practically nothing to do with what it was originally.  I think they're just using the name and the appeal to sell a proprietary system that probably allows for monitoring of transactions.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:02:14
youre right... they just know how to a Block Chain works and decided it can solve EVERY problem.
for instance why on earth would I want to use a block chain for messaging when many secure messaging protocols exist which don't require it?  'bitcoin community answer' : because it's cool
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:23:42
probably because they pay him?  ;)
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:31:04
just curious, what do you believe OT can do?
I'm making no such claims, and I dont really view the idea as a competitor, as I dont directly profit from it.  It would great if an open source system existed that OT pretends to be.  Not only does OT not live up to it's claims in terms of maturity, it's probably not even possible to make a system that fits all the claims of the 'lead developer'/owner of the code.
If you worked in cars and you saw someone selling a toyota and telling people it goes 300mph, what would you do?

Chris means 'toxic' in the same way Ben Benanke means 'toxic' - as in his extremely poor sense of judgement and foolish actions coming back to haunt him.
this is obviously Chris.  Who would bother researching this so extensively?
Chris: get a life.  I've seen many people do what you're doing, and it didn't end well.  The last 'currency messiah' I knew ended up with dozens of people chasing after him.  But it won't matter much will it, because practically everything you're doing is under some silly name.  I can't believe *anyone* buying this stuff at this point.
so you are now quoting yourself under false identities?
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:54:15
there are problems with Colored Coins.
a better idea: 
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:19:37
true, but it's a corporate technology.  The basic issue with Ripple is that we don't really KNOW exactly what it is in terms of 1) technology 2) licensing 3) ownership.
The name is a proprietary term so we can't really expect it to behave in the same way as other open source projects.  Color Coins is open source.  So is Confidence Chains.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:07:20
here's a longer technical explanation about why the claims of Open Transactions don't add up:
It's really amazing that people ignore the very simple fact that Open Transactions *has never been used for a production system*.  People can't seem to believe this, but the fact remains- it has lots of fanbois(and sock puppets looking like fanbois) but absolutely no users.
So if youre a forum lurker who lives in your mom's basement, OT is for you.
