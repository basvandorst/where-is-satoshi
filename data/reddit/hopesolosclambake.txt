That's the thing is we're being killed by a cludge, waiting for a fix. If it we're me, up the block AND work on lightning AND shove the entire block chain up Ver's blown out sphincter.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:33:42
He's a sales dickhead. End of story.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:11
Basically banking on lightning at this point. Either it'll be a coup or it'll be a slaughter.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:56:32
At least you're getting fucked again, eh?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:54
We do have a blocksize problem though. Everything's a great idea until volume strikes, then it's a card-castle.
Still hodling, but Lightning Network better be some next level shit.
PS: fuck Roger Ver and BCH.

Chances are there's at least one Asian awake at all times. Think about that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:11:28
I don't want to be part of anything that Ver signs off on these days. Still, ad hominem aside, what's the reason? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:42:20
Coinbase. He wants you to keep your shit on Coinbase, his partner, and sell your coin and pay them fees. As an "inevitable" outcome.

Segwit? But Brondo's got what plants crave.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:15
They're not there to have a discussion. There's vested interests in that room for Bcash.

SoCal-ism is really just about riding the waves of life and soaking up the sun whenever you can.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:04:46
Just do the calculations by hand.

Dude's not a coder he's a dickhead who got rich running a hardware parts business.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:40:45
He's exactly what is effective in America. An annointed authority that when they speak people get lost in the words and forget what the question was.

I'm also pro banditry. I love it when my skull is convexed for me and my money stolen. Free market!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:47:23
True sociopath.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:14
Yeah they've been fucked up for me since BCH got listed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:44:31
He also thinks selling bombs is a non crime.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:57:46
Because women don't really marry poor husbands.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:36
I tried 2 days ago, still pending. Gemini too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:30:58
He sold parts online. He's a know nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:49
He was an hero.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:41:01
This is what I don't get though, monkey-patch the fucker until you have a proper fix, don't just let the customer wallow.
Either they have a vested interest in the fees or ... ???

Popularity === intentional nerfing. Now everyone use my unpopular coin and wonder at it's lack of popularity related issues.
