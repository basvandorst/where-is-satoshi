I hear some say their card doesn't work, my Wirex card got swallowed by the atm, did this happen to yours too?
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:13:06
Because it is not an ICO that people can pump

Are there main net wallets available already? How did you do it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:47:57
By buying BTC, but %wise there is way less profit to be made than by pumping a new coin by 30x

Wirex debit card same story

I hope people that live on fiat that is based on dept have a back up plan. I was living outside of my country of origin and my native currency (what I was still earning that time) dropped 25% over a few weeks as a result of QE. Dept isn't getting less and QE will not stop. I think being full in BTC is safer today than being in fiat. The world is changing fast, see how 'rich' countries got in trouble in 2008 and never really recovered. After a bull market of 9 years (only on free money) it is 'safe' to say that another crash is coming soon.

For all the online marketeers, Torguard has an affiliate program too! Set up a LND channel with them, buy the VPN and start to promote it! This way you can promote LND and earn money on it, so actually it is an affiliate program for LND too! I go work on this and promote them on my websites soon! If they get a huge inflow of customers by accepting LND payments many others will follow = huge adoption!

Before the 2x fork i discussed a lot with big blockers and they always said that 80% of the users were brainwashed and thats why they are supporting core. Another thing they said is that users will follow the miners, and I said that miners will follow the users (so I was brainwashed again). The reason that 80% of the users is backing core is unprovable, but when the Bcash attack (using the flawed EDA) occurred they managed to get 70% of the miners to mine Bcash and the users / money didn't follow. Now there is a proof that the users decide and not the miners (and don't call it brainwash again!)
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:15:01
This is way to deep for the moderate Bcash fan. They just want to push on the button and send a cheap transaction. This is even better with LND, but their leader told them that this is centralized.

@_date: 2018-01-16 13:06:53
Haha, please explain? The crash of 80% in 2014 was caused by the hack and collapse of almost the only exchange in the world. This was a huge deal. Beside that BTC was that time very immature. Today actually nothing happened, the fundamentals are extremely bullish, there is a huge group of strong HODLers and we are down already 40%. Even if something really bad was happening it doesn't make sense to go lower than 60% from all time high. We might go lower now (I think technically at worse 8000 = 200 day MA makes sense), but soon the next bull run will start.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:35:07

@_date: 2018-01-02 10:31:15
LND is there but not really consumer ready yet, an idea: Design a smart contract on RSK where ideas to implement LN can get funded using shitcoins (like Bcash, they are so proud to be used more for donations), these shitcoins get automatically traded to BTC and become a bounty for the one that writes the code of the certain application. Applications that are most needed will get the most donations (market forces) and the highest reward. The release of the bounty can be set by minimal amount of downloads, votes on the platform or a combination and can of course be given to multiple devs since it is open source. We seen the BTC community is very generous and this could boost the innovation on LND 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:33:03
I am sure I did, and if I didn't you can try normally 3 times

Roger always say that 2nd layers like LND will be build on Bcash as well and even work better because the lower fees. But this will be hard / impossible right without Segwit? I was quite sure about this, but I didn't hear Lopp counter this.

Simply? Ask the 2x dev (s?) how simple it is to make a working block size increase. If the community was stupid enough to let it go through we would have seen an enormous mayhem!
Beside that there are other reasons to not SIMPLY increase block size. As that it is not a good idea to SIMPLY increase the money supply to counter a financial crisis (we will see the result soon).

Mainstream media is controlled by governments and big banks. It is really strange that there has never been a (mainstream) journalist that saw the potential of bitcoin before the blockchain hype began in 2015 / 2016. 
They say the government is there for the people, but by censoring the mainstream media many missed out on HUGE gains. And the hilarious thing is: after years of advising to not get involved in it now they want a part in the form of tax.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:39
I think you can't say there is or there is no scalability. Scaling happens bit by bit and it looks like it is going exponentially soon with RSK and LN. I think Bitcoin is ready to go mainstream as digital gold already, but not yet for daily payments. However it looks like it is coming soon!

Bullshit, this confusion is holding back adoption of crypto in general, I think many people who want to get involved get distracted when they get confused immediately and stop their Bitcoin journey or move to hyped alts and get burned in the next bear market. Not even speaking about the ones that lose funds. Without all the Bcash attacks, confusion and spam the BTC price might be way higher today than BTC and BCH together.
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:32:22

They should, creating a dangerous situation for a victimless crime is bullshit
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:04:05
My point is that confusion is bad for adoption overall and is damaging for the entire industry. Since Bcash is not Bitcoin by any measure I will not confuse people by calling it 'Bitcoin Cash'. If you feel offended by that is your problem, I have a proper reason to call it Bcash and won't change it.

Nice calculation but it doesn't make any sense. In this year alone Segwit, sgnor signatures, LN and RSK could be all be available for the Bitcoin network (if BU wasn't blocking this innovation). I think it is realistic to expect new solutions will come every year and this will scale exponentially. I think the only point you can make is that it is impossible to scale everything on chain for 7 billion users (make that calculation lol)

Many people will sell low and buy high. I keep my BTC investment till this BUllshit is resolved. Not because I am not afraid for what is coming, but because I want to take the risk and know that if BTC won't die from this it will come back way stronger. I will lose all or get huge returns, Im not gonna trade in between. I only hedge small amounts in alts with my income, but if this fork issue is past, this money will probably flow back in BTC (not my money, but the market's money that is invested in alts, they will crash)
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:57:00
Bitcoin is a network of 'trust', and the fact that it isn't easy to changes the rules increases the trust enormously. I totally agree with this tweet. Because it is not easy to change the basics of Bitcoin, the market will be forced to come up with other solutions like second layers and efficiency increases. These 'harder' solutions will also bring other positive side effects and will expand the use cases. BU might be a short term solution, but will harm the trustworthy reputation of BTC and slow down innovation (because the pressure to solve problems will decrease). Please people take the slow, secure and innovative way to build this till now very successful Bitcoin network! 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:32:15
I totally understand what you do, I did same with Ether when I was on 100% profit (sold half so I couldn't loose anymore) and I wasn't sure about the future of Ethereum. 
Only the title of your post suggests that you are very bearish on the future of Bitcoin, for the readers that are only scanning titlels. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:36:00
I agree 100% with your post. Seeing all the possibilities for Bitcoin made me unbelievable bullish. Payments is only the top of the iceberg and guys like Roger are only focused on that use case. The best times for Bitcoin were just coming with multiple updates, apps, side chains and LN coming soon and this was reflected in a very steady bull run. The decision of the SEC was only a temporary hit on the price and when the bullshit of BU shouldn't show up we would be on new highs already. That the BU supporters have other opinions I understand, but if they really love Bitcoin they should support Segwit, because SW is the basic for a lot of new innovation and a good first and secure way of scaling. In the past I always respected Roger Ver, but his denying of SW made me very suspicious (he is afraid to lose personal reputation if Core does scale or is willing to destroy or take over Bitcoin). BU supporters, please ask your 'leader' to implement SW in BU and let the market later decide to HF or not. 
Im very disappointed about this situation, for the first time sinds I learned about Bitcoin I am afraid that it will fail.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:26:03
Very bullish, more secure, faster and cheaper than Ethereum and using a coin that is more widely accepted and available. 
Also I don't understand why RSK is never mentioned in the scaling debate, it will be a big deal.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:16:49
Do I understand it right if I read this like this?:
The consensus for upgrading is decentralized in 3 layer, the miners, devs and users (including wallets and exchanges). In my opinion there are 2 possible reasons why BU is so popular under miners:
1: They want to block segwit to keep the fees high and fill their pockets in short term, so they are only signaling BU but don't want to fork to BU (BU don't support segwit).
2: The miners are willing to take the power over Bitcoin (maybe forced by the Chinese government, it comes same time as the regulations on the exchanges). In this case they are willing to fork, to get rid of the other miners and form one block of miners with the same goal. 
So by forcing Segwit in October, core will trigger the ultimate test of this 3 layer decentralization. If the BU miners are only signaling to keep the fees high, they will accept Segwit to be able to keep mining for the biggest Bitcoin economy (economy of core is way larger) and if they really are evil and willing to take power they will fork off, but then let them fork off!!
I can be wrong, but if this is right I am fully supporting this action.
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:49:09
I think BTC will rise the coming years / decennia steady because the expanding use cases and adoption. On top of this a few huge bubbles followed by a crash will take place and I think the 3rd one is now starting. 
Because the Bitcoin network is growing year after year, the price after a crash will be higher than before the bubble. 
 
For an answer why the price is rising so strong now I didn't hear anyone mention the technical aspects: Segwit, Lightning and RKS are coming really soon!
Off course I agree with the other reasons mentioned here and also the coming ETF will add a lot of value, because it will make Bitcoin easier available for investors and I think the coming rise will be mainly caused by adoption by professional investors (Here is a lot of money involved!) There are so many bullish fundamentals!!!
Please understand that a rising bitcoin price will attract thieves. Now it is extra important to secure your bitcoins well. Don't keep big amounts on exchanges or online wallets, but choose a secure way like a hardware wallet.

The combination of pump / dump and the EDA flaw of BCH is quit dangerous. Im happy the EDA will make BCH way less profitable very soon and the fork will avoid this for future events. It is bizar that a flaw in an altcoin can damage Bitcoin so hard because many people don't know what is going on and value BCH because many miners are mining it. In combination with the pump of some big block wales of course. I wonder how the ones feel now that lost a lot of money because they followed their pumping and dumping leader. Hope the community becomes smart and get immune to this pump and dumps
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:14:47
I learned:
-That a flaw in an altcoins difficulty adjustment in combination with a pump and a lot of misinformation can seriously damage bitcoin
-That miners follow the money instantly and money follows miners slowly (now i know for sure core would win when 2x did happen with 80% hash rate backing)
-That the exponential support in BTC price is holding strong
-That a manipulated price explosion is almost on its end when the volume doesn't come for 80% from one exchange anymore but spreads over all exchanges
-That Slush pool is very reliable and is the fundament of Bitcoin
-That a libertarian who want to start his own libertarian country misuses his power in a free market and is using other people to enlarge his own power / wealth (very disappointing because i am a libertarian and hope free markets can work)

@_date: 2017-04-09 08:27:37
I hope more eyes will open and Bitcoin can move forward again. Roger maybe didn't know about ASICS boost, but there wasn't much intelligence needed to see that blocking Segwit by BU didn't make any sense. Before the ASICS boost news came out I already wrote that the purpose for blocking Segwit was: or avoiding loosing face when Bitcoin DID scale after Segwit, or being pushed by an government or bank, or filling pockets with mining fees as long as they are high (blocking segwit, so LN will delay).
So in any case Ver had been very stupid to be used by the miners or he had a bad intention. This all was a big deal for Bitcoin, the launch to the moon was just underway!
My respect for this guy is gone in any case, except when he apologize to the Bitcoin community and forse BU to implement Segwit immediately.

An online in-browser wallet can be hacked, your private key can get stolen. A hardware wallet will protect your private key. Another advantage is that you can manage multiple wallets and different cryptocurrencies and protect online accounts like wordpress, Gmail and dropbox with only one device and one recovery seed.

I don't understand that BU supporters always mention the all time low in cryptocurrency market cap. of Bitcoin as a scaling cause. Bitcoin was in a very strong bull run and captured a bigger part of the crypto space every day till BU came up. Without BU Bitcoin was probably on an all time high in price and crypto market cap as well. And many of us should be way more wealthy.
Thank you BU (llshit)!!!

@_date: 2018-03-20 14:26:13
He suggest that hubs that never close the channel can do fractional reserve banking, but I think that is not correct. All the Satoshi's in the payment channels are backed by an unconfirmed transaction, so you simply can't create them out of thin air. When you update your wallet to a higher amount it have to come from your own unconfirmed transaction or from someone else on the other side of the payment channel. I think this guy made up a nice story, but left some details out to make it look realistic.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:26:47
I don't agree, there is a cycle that is repeated multiple times already in the history of btc and since all the fundamentals are very positive (pure technical / cyclic selloff) it is likely that it will happen again. All previous cycles started lower than where it ended after the crash, and this will very likely happen again.

Take them off Coinbase anyway, but don't store them on any exchange in general. Keep control over your own keys, then you will have coins on both of the chains. A hardware wallet or paper wallet is best, hardware wallet might be easier (paper wallet is complicated to create 100% securely).
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:36:39

I don't really agree on the chance of 50 to 80% that it becomes worthless. I think 1% is more realistic. I can't come up with a cause that BTC becomes worthless other than a huge hack or bug, what is highly unlikely in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:24:47
I think there is no way that bitcoin could ever collapse, if a bug or attack creates a critical situation consensus under the community will always be reached to fix the problem + an eventually POW change to wipe off the attackers. A huge crash in price of 90+% could happen if it comes this far. However bitcoin = the community and as long as the community exist bitcoin will exist. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:54:49

Bitcoin is a ledger where millions of people agree on who owns what and that is protected by the (far) biggest unhackable and indestructible super computer in the world. If there was a company doing this, does the stock have intrinsic value?
Yes of course!!! This is a service that is amazingly useful, not even mentioned the deflationary and decentralized characteristics!
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:20:21
I agree, a POW change should not be done. Bitcoin is not Bitcoin without POW, POW is the factor that makes BTC so enormously strong compare to other crypto's. Certainly mining centralization is a huge problem, but I expect that if 2x fails the situation will only get better afterwards (mining takes off in other countries like Japan / lifespan of chips get longer). However it is good to have the code for POW change standby as last resort when the hash power behind core is smal after the fork and 2x miners are so pathetic to attack the core chain. But I think / hope this will not happen

The funny thing is: The people who are complaining most about altcoins taking over Bitcoin, are the ones that are delaying LN and side chains by blocking Segwit. (BU)
I am very sure that activation of Segwit will boost Bitcoin and take many altcoins down. The only reason for this trend of rising alts is BU. Who is gonna use Dash or Monero if you can use LN?

Maybe the got in shorting 4 months ago and now they start long.

Agree, focus on improving the protocol, educate others and keep the f*cking government out of this. Now crypto will be cashed out to pay bureaucrats and govs will see more reason for strict regulation. I don't agree on this lawsuit.

exactly my thoughts

I think it is temporary, a new application is easier to build on  a new blockchain, but it isn't better. It will be more expensive, less secure and not profiting of the network effect and infrastructure. 
I think finally Bitcoin will enable all these applications too, but it will take some time because it is way more complicated. E.g. RSK will enable smart contracts and LN will enable instant, almost free an anonymous payments. Other applications will follow later on.
This will make all the anonymous and faster alts obsolete and later also the other alts.
There is only one internet too

I think also because many existing businesses and altcoins will become absolete when 2nd layers come live.

Very excited indeed. Does someone know when RSK will be launched for real use? It should be somewhere around now right? There is so little information available.
RSK promises to be faster, cheaper and more secure than ETH, but there is no hype at all, almost nobody is talking or writing about it. 
I think RSK will be better than ETH, but ETH is hyped more and banks and big companies are way more invested in ETH (probably because they see an opportunity to take over control). 
Sold half of my ETH for bitcoin yesterday, because I expect Segwit soon and side chains will bring huge innovation to BTC.

Is possible, but I suspect that the consortium of banks that was investigating how to use blockchain, meanwhile also was investigating how to destroy Bitcoin, before Bitcoin will destroy them. Probably they didn't find a way, tried to attack via BU but failed....
What is an easier way to pick the 2nd coin that is way less secure and decentralized, take control, hype it up to overtake Bitcoin and make all the new innovation happen on ETH what they control instead of BTC. The combination of the ETH price tripled after the banks got in and the coming change to POS makes me suspicious. They could have stake of more than 50% already.

1:1 will be automatically i think. When someone buys a smart coin, one BTC will be locked up. Now the supply gets smaller so the price of BTC will go up. Next smart coin will be for this new price. So it doesn't matter if you buy a smart coin or a bitcoin, both will be subtracted from the BTC supply pool.
