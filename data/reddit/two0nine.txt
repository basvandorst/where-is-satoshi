I don't think that is simply a matter of it being over peoples heads. I'm curious as to who Satoshi is for a number of reasons.  So, it's not irrelevant to me. At the same time, having authored Open Source code the idea of what that means and implies is not over my head. I understand what you're trying to say but I think that you may have oversimplified things.

**Civil Rehabilitation Law**
The Civil Rehabilitation Law was introduced in April 2000, replacing the Composition Law. 
The Civil Rehabilitation Law may be applied to all corporations and individuals, including joint stock companies, limited liability companies, medical corporations and educational corporations. The purpose of the Civil Rehabilitation Law is rapid rehabilitation before a corporate failure becomes more serious. 
The party applying the Law is normally an obligor. A creditor may also apply, however. 
The management rights rest with the former management in principle. However, there are cases in which a supervision order (supervision committee members are selected and given guardianship over a business owner) or an administration order (an administrator is selected and appointed and manages the business in place of the business owner) may be issued based on an application of an interested person or the official power of a court. 
The approval of a rehabilitation plan requires the approval of a majority of creditors present owed half or more of the amount of reported credits. 
If the approval of creditors with three fifths or more of reported credits is obtained, a procedure to investigate and determine credits may be omitted (simple rehabilitation). 
If approved by all of notified creditors, approval for a plan can be obtained immediately (approved rehabilitation).
Japan’s Civil Rehabilitation Law was intended “to enable application for rehabilitation procedures and the commencement of such procedures prior to the occurrence of bankruptcy factors.” [1] Holding the creditor meeting is arbitrary [2] to enable a debtor to continue with the execution of its business and management/disposal of its assets, [3] and otherwise sustain operations, while committing to corporate rehabilitation.
Although the Corporate Reorganization Law applies only to joint-stock corporations (kabushiki kaisha, or KK, in Japanese), the Civil Rehabilitation Law covers all companies, including foreign-affiliated businesses. Although management can begin corporate rehabilitation on its own prior to the stage of collapse, the law was enacted as a “process to prevent business failure.”
Under Civil Rehabilitation Procedures, assets and liabilities are reassessed as if bankruptcy has occurred, [4] and expected bankruptcy dividend amounts are established. This assessment of assets is conducted, in principle, on the basis of selling price, [5] and a dividend based on the liquidation value is applied to the rehabilitation creditors (principle of liquidation value guarantee [6] ). However, civil rehabilitation companies continue their operations in principle and do not actually liquidate, so any earnings from their remaining assets can exceed reassessed liquidation value, creating a framework in which a business can be rehabilitated swiftly.
Corporate rehabilitation has been limited to a select number of companies in Japan. Among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many companies are unable to find financial support and are forced into bankruptcy (i.e., liquidation) without any prospect of reorganization. According to a survey by Teikoku Databank, only 2,841 of the companies that filed for protection from creditors under the Civil Rehabilitation Law obtained approval for their rehabilitation plans. **That accounts for only 66.7 percent of all applicants.** [7]

edit2: Line breaks are nice! ~~I'm reading it to say that if gox can show 50% of lost credit/coins then they could be granted the ability to try and move forward. I think that would be under an newly agreed upon set of operating procedures as well. But yah, that's my optimistic/biased guess as i'm sitting on goXcoin~~
edit3: Edit2 was probably wrong. Except for the part about line breaks being nice. corporate rehabilitation ++
