Also curious

I a lot of my friends and co-workers are aware of ETH existence, they don't know much about it yet though. However, looking at the fees and time it takes to do anything with BTC, I am getting really nervous on what to actually hold. I think it might be a matter of time until BTC continues to loose market share.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:41:26
Aren't a lot of coins rivaling bitcoin? For instance LTC, BCH, maybe even Monero?
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:40:46
I see a lot of controversy regarding Lightning Network. Is there a release date for LN? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:52:16
Use Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:32:16
Give it a rest. You guys attacked Ethereum few years ago.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:55:42
I hate coinmarketcap for their advertisement. Use livecoinwatch.com instead
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:35:20
While BCH picks up the slack, a little more each day.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:36:25
Dude this is not a healthy approach! It is not like BTC does not have any better competitors to take its place. LMAO!
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:49:28
We need BCH to be added as well.
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:19:00
Hahaha I indeed lived up to my name. More than I would like to admit, could have made so many better trades haha. I guess you live and you learn.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:08:34
Thank you! I never saw anyone use it, that's why I wasn't aware.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:05:54
I just did....
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:56:08
If each of the citizens purchases $200 worth, that's 5.6billion added to crypto!!!
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:11:23
Does it work just like the BCH tip?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:16:45
No wayyy $89,999.99. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:47:41
I'm not sure about DOGE.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:46:35
You're grasping at straws man haha
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:05:49
You guys are ridiculous... 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:19:16
LOL, the 2nd grade insults I expected from this sub. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:39:57
You must be a scholar... /s LOL
@_date: 2018-07-07 22:24:08
People don't spend Bitcoin because fees make it unfeasible.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:14:21
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:57:35
Buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:46:49
Thus why this was intended as a joke... Because this is a Bitcoin subreddit...
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:16:24
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:14:57
Sorry, I don't claim on-chain transactions are more anonymous. Although if anonymous transactions are the priority both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash would be a poor choice. As I said, claim in which states big blocks lead to centralization has been debunked. Please recall that Bitcoin never had a blocksize limit until around 2013 which was artificially put in place with the intent to remove it in the near future.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:03:47
LOL. Use Bitcoin Cash instead.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:53:13
This is a delirious comment... Yes LN eventually settles on-chain but what happens in-between is not recorded. Bitcoin was always designed to permanently store all transactions on chain, it's what blockchain is. Also larger blocksizes leading to centralization has been debunked over and over.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:32:15
LN is more representative of our current banking system. Yes your transactions are somewhat more private, but they're not anonymous.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:28:02
At this point getting initial investment would be great...
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:56:47
I very much agree with you. The internet evolved to be easier and more reliable to use. Opposite of what LN has done...
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:28:08
Delusion. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:44:56
Take financial advise from a rat....
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:14:59
OK, thanks. I appreciate your help!
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:06:37
LN basically does Bitcoin transactions without registering it on the Bitcoin blockchain. LN has veered Bitcoin from having all transactions secure and stored on the blockchain as intended by Satoshi, his whitepaper, basically what Bitcoin was developed for.

Who is the "World" indebted to? ...
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:04:01
Fair time to buy
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:59:37
I received one BCH tip, and that is really cool. I am trying to find out if there's one for BTC to rival?
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:06:41
Or outsource the job to India, you'll save a ton of satoshis. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:37:21
Bitcoin is the future, as you can track what the politicians are spending our money on.
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:11:46
Lightning Network did nothing to alleviate complications, and foster ease of use... It did the exact opposite... 
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:54:55
If we can do that now, how come I'm hearing the news where billions of dollars cannot be accounted for and are missing?
