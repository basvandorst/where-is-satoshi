Yup. These events show a major vulnerability in crypto, mainly that the exchanges, asic miners, and whales hold way more power than we thought. 
Like, let's say that I have one of these new crypto credit cards that people are trying to develop and I go to purchase something at a store and it's denied because my funds fluctuated 10-20% because a major exchange introduced an altcoin. It's beginning to appear that this is not a currency but an asset and payment system for international transactions only.

THIS is exactly why I have a problem with this. This is not an ORGANIC coin takeover, it's an attempted at a FORCED coin takeover by many bitcoin elites and insiders. While it's good that BTC is independent of any banking institution, US exchanges, television networks, etc should be monitored by the SEC. 
These figures are trying to disrupt crypto's egalitarian-anarchic nature by colluding and creating crypto hierarchies of power.

Amazing how people are saying that people on this sub are just "salty" when this kind of swing is INCREDIBLY bad for the adoption of crypto in general. The Chinese miners and Bitmain have been trying to pump the fuck out of BCH for months and it's showing that users have less power than coordinated miners and whales. I was very concerned last time BCH swung and BTC dipped in a mere weekend and this is an attempted mirror of that situation.

That's the strangest part to me. There was no organic build up to this online in the past few weeks. If people were really concerned about fees and speed and thought BCH was better, they could have switched on a different exchange long ago. But suddenly it's like "Coinbase added it? Wow I just realized that BCH is better than BTC!!". Very strange.

"Conspiracy theories" ... the CEO of Coinbase himself has admitted that this looks like an inside trading leak and is investigating. Hard to call this conspiracy when the actual CEO admits that this looks like insider trading/insider leaking.

I think I lost a few brain cells reading this. "With crypto, there cannot be collusion because it's decentralized, yet I can only buy and withdraw my crypto in USD through 2 or 3 centralized exchanges".

Many people like you discredit people with shitty pro-BTC replies as being "cultish" when there are actual valid arguments that this shit is worrying as fuck for all crypto.

These buy orders D:

Last night I was thinking to myself, "this is actually starting to go mainstream now", after I had neighbors asking me about Bitcoin and where/how to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:18:41
Did the same. When you see that vertical line and you start having 50k BTC in your eyes, you realize you are being delusional. It is more mainstream than ever but that doesn't mean everyone will buy. People coming in seeing a vertical cliff are going to be skeptical about buying in right now.
The market may be irrational and keep going up but you should be proud that you secured yourself some REALIZED profits in the meantime.

"I suddenly realized the superior technology of BCH at 4pm today and suddenly swapped all of my investments from BTC to BTC. People only buy cryptos that have the best technology" - Every fedora tipping BCH supporter here.

I love holding currencies that can fluctuate by 10% in a day because of the actions of an exchange. You're talking about technology like it's the reason for this change rather than the actions of Coinbase. Boy do I wish investors invested because of tech alone. I've got news for you, most of the crypto investors who invested in the past year did so because of a 20% interest in tech and an 80% interest in gains.

"Fake news!"

I agree, but (if it happens), this transition should have been gradual. What happened here seems to be a mix of leaked insider knowledge by Coinbase (Coinbase CEO saying that they are going to conduct an internal investigation because they are also suspicious that the price rose before the announcements) and a coordinated effort by Chinese miners Bitmain and Antpool to delegitimize Bitcoin and convert Bitcoin miners to BCH miners. Coinbase really fumbled here with underestimating the power that they have gotten in recent months and they need to start acting like a US stock exchange that has the SEC breathing down their neck at every move. I'm fearing the the SEC could get involved here and it would be VERY bad press for cryptocurrencies in the USA. 
On the mining note, the fact that the last BTC drop and BCH rise in Nov. also coordinated with a change in BTC difficulty shows that there is either too much power in the hands of major ASIC miners like Bitmain or that there is a vital flaw being exposed for POW cryptocurrencies where discrepancies will inevitably develop between mining profits and market value causing miners to jump ship on a coin very suddenly. In light of current events I fear that it's the major ASIC factories moving their weight around for political reasons (and ultimately financial as a result of the politics) that are beginning to cause a problem. 
Anyways, my main argument is that today's events didn't come from a coordinated awakening of the masses to the benefits of BCH, but from the poor (and possibly coordinated) actions of some of crypto's elites. The Coinbase thing stinks of an SEC investigation, particularly because the CEO himself admitted that the price rise of BCH pre-market price rise smelled of an insider leak. And what if that leak made it all the way to Jihan and friends?
(For the record I made some good money on BTC but I don't currently hold. I was just worried in Nov about the flippening and I'm VERY worried now that Coinbase is caught up in it.)

I may get back in but it's a bit too volatile right now.

I think they would just need this but at double speed

Man, I really can't wait for the next series of whale wars.

It's true that Crypto is a new game from traditional stocks but that doesn't mean its market patterns and value are completely immune from certain traditional market tendencies.

I know a lot of people here are libertarians but this is exactly why the federal reserve exists. If crypto becomes a haven for whale manipulation, the US government will eventually ban it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:18
If the takeover actually happens, all of the public support that came in the last year is going to disappear and the crypto market is going to crash. How can anyone have any faith in the value of their investment if a clone/fork coin can be created and take over the old coin through whale manipulation? What a troubling day.
