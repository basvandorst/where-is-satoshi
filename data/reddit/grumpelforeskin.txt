I feel your pain. I've had near a near 1k bank transfer sat waiting with cex.io waiting to be approved since July 23rd. Its gone up an insane amount since then and they won't even tell me why there is such a a delay :(.  It brings a tear to my eye.

Yeah that did seem to be a theme. I think with cards they're bound by specific laws and your card issuer can get on their case about it if they mess you around, it probably also leaves black marks against their company if they get loads of chargebacks. I read somewhere they're not bound by sinilar laws with bank transfers so, well screw customer service.

Don't get your hopes up. Read [here]( the comments [here]( and the reviews [here]( Honestly I think they're about to disappear with everyone's money/coins. Just be thankful it only cost you 100 euros. Good luck.

You must work for them. They are the shittest exchange I have used and I'm far from alone feeling that way. Read these reviews at  [Trustpilot]( and read the comments on the article  [here]( These people have had my bank transfer pending for over 3 weeks and the best customer service they can muster up is a canned response telling me to be patient.  All the while Bitcoin goes up in price and the actual investment value lost increases. Joke company and I would implore anyone to just go elsewhere. I'm unfortunately prepping myself to just say goodbye to the money they're "verifying".

I found Coinbase fine for bank transfers because the limits are so much higher (card limits sucked), my money was also in my Coinbase account 24hrs after sending it from my bank.  Otherwise I've also had good but limited experiences with Kraken and Bitfinex. I'm sure others here have more seasoned advice though.

Yes, thank you. I managed to get my deposit and was able to buy coins and move to my wallet with no hassle. I guess you were just really behind with things.

I suspect CEX are about to go under. There are an insane number of people missing coin and fiat deposit / withdrawals and just getting generic responses back from CEX. They've even stopped bothering to defend themselves on here. Good luck.

Nope.  No credit still and have stopped responding to my support tickets asking for updates (3 days so far).  Not sure what else to do :(
