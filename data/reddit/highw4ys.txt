That Dennis twitter guy seems to be seriously butthurt about BCH somehow. Most people oppose BCH, but he's like above average unhealthily aggressive towards it. Is there any special reason for this?

SegWit supporter here.      
Please explain how having or not-having a public mailing list, roadmaps, weekly meetings or whatever is in any way related to zenzorship. Reading threads like these is what's really getting on my nevers, because they don't add anything to the SegWit vs. BU debate. Can we please just stop this "lol lol we're better than u"-blah and focus on the important stuff? It makes core appear in a bad light!
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:09:55
I lol'd when I read *start*.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:46:02
I *partially* agree with your OP, but that's probably as close as our opinions on that matter will get.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:11:59


That's still not in any way related to zenzorship      


*This* is about zenzorship, I agree.

Okay, a nonbiased question from my side: What dimension would you expect / estimate these miniscule fees to be in? A few cents? Maybe even less than a single cent? (Based on current $-market-value of course)

Guys, seriously, if this is the prevailing mindset right now, please update the Bitcoin FAQ sticky post in this sub. The first four videos in there include a lot of potential Bitcoin uses and visionary stuff that apparently nobody wants or cares for anymore. I guess it's outdated by now and will give Bitcoin Newcomers a false impression of what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:32:21
"Terrorists"...? *facepalm*
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:24:14
It would still be completely impracticle and thus useless because of *fees*. Even if fees stayed at 1-2$ and never grew any higher, they would still ruin half of the possible future uses of bitcoin mentioned in those videos.

German guy here. I don't know how much of this article is true, but please keep in mind that BILD is the absolute **worst** source of information from germany. They are infamous for spreading FUD in epic amounts, their sources are usually shady and dubios.    
In this article for example they state that *"an expert"* told BILD that all banks will charge for cash withdrawal in the next 1 or 2 years, without ever mentioning who that expert is or why he is an expert, which makes me doubt that this "expert" even exists.    
Even the headline is lurid af. It says "Customers of Sparkasse have to pay for cash withdrawals", but when you read the article, you find out that only *in a few very small regions* there are *a few bank account types* which will have you pay for cash only *in very few cases* (like 20¢ if you withdraw cash more than 5 times per month).    
This article isn't even worth the time reading it, and much less worth the time that I just spent making a reddit comment about it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:41:23
Okay, I'm a Bitcoin Dolphin then. Because the phrases "Terrorist" and "Bitcoin Terrorist" seem to have about as much in common as I have with a dolphin.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:42:48
Just a quick FYI:
This is not the top comment.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:39:10
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:55:49
They do it from time to time and there already is enough proof of it.      
I'm not a frequent redditor, but I've been checking out both subreddits over the last few weeks. The other sub is completely useless, but the fact that even this sub that is said to be supporting *my* point of view is always so full of kindergarten and zenzorship-drama is slowly making me feel kinda lost in this whole debate.      
Maybe reddit does not have the right community to talk about the future of bitcoin. Or maybe it's just me. Maybe I should stay away from reddit for a while.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:04:25
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:10:18
Exactly. Every sane person here just keeps hodling on to both, BTC and BCH. It's the most clever thing to do right now.
Just keep your coins and take a break from the toxic reddit community for a few months, you can come back whenever you want.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:53:20
Huh? I didn't even say a single word about market caps...
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:25:02


Nobody ever said that, moderating this sort of thing is completely fine. It starts getting dubious whenever you remove legit people's posts simply because of their opinions.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:57:57
Nobody can forsee the future, so please be aware of the risks. While I think investing in Bitcoin is a solid idea, invest only as much as you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:37:36
Dude, neither you nor I can forsee the future. If you don't understand that the cryptocurrency with the 2nd biggest trading volume in the whole world **might** stay alive and gain a lot of value as cryptocurrencys in general get more popular, I'm sorry for you.
I prefer BTC over Bcash anytime! And dumping all Bcash now just because you don't like the coin is a decision you can make for yourself, but it's aweful financial advice to give someone else. They might bitterly regret it if Bcash keeps growing.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:40:06
While I agree with you, I can still understand *a part* of the "censorship!"-screaming crowd. Moderation did go way overboard here from time to time.
A while ago I made [this comment]( it was completely harmless and upvoted 9 times, still it got shadow-removed after a while and I have no idea why. All it said was "Let's be honest - that's an awful comparison".
Also, why did you sometimes sort comments to show the most controversial ones first by default, instead of the most upvoted ones? This happened really often when the top comment was constructive criticism that didn't quite fit this subreddits narrative, and it often made toxic shitposts appear on top instead.
I know that changing the way comments are sorted by default is in no way censorship, it still feels like a cheap way to influence people's opinions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:18:42
Sometimes posts got removed not because they broke any rules, but because someone didn't like your opinion.
There was [this thread]( a while ago. I posted a comment that merely said *"Let's be honest - that's an awful comparison."*, it was upvoted 11 times. You can still see it [in my post history](
Then it got removed. My harmless statement is nowhere to be found now, and the thread got changed to show the most controversial posts first instead of the most upvoted ones.
You can agree or disagree with my statement, but I think that removing it was a way over the top reaction.
I feel like it's gotten a bit better though in the last few months.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:18:56
Adam Back said that beyond a certain point side-chains won't solve scaling.
I'd guess that once side-chains / LN / etc reach their limits, we'll either go for an old-fashioned blocksize increase or come up with something completely new.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:12:27
Are we really that desperate just because of a dip?
It's getting embarassing
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:41
so does LN tbh
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:25:25
doesn't matter if 80%, 10% or 1% want to fork themselves off of the network. if they want to fork, they can fork.
i just don't get why they'd want to do that, i can't think of any user group that's interested mid- or long-term in S2X. bigblockers have their BCH, rest is happy with BTC. no money to earn by mining S2X.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:15:32
I think the way you did this is very good!
You present who he is and why he is a very controversial person in a neutral way.
This is the absolute best way to introduce new people to things and help them form their own opinions, forcefeeding them with premade opinions is really unhealthy for this community in the long run.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:03:41
I feel you bro...

Far more important for this subreddit:
Does chaturbate support UASF?

The information you're looking for is at 
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:51:40
Fully agree! We should rely on verifiable unambigous facts only.
And I love alpacas.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:48:00
Thanks for confirming! (:

This will either be heavily downvoted or deleted soon

Guys, this twitter propaganda apparatus is getting more cringeworthy and alienating every day.
This *is* a valid concern, but maybe confirm if it's true *before* tweeting about it? Otherwise this tweet is just as FUDdy and useless as saying "I heard samson mow is planning a nuclear strike on San Francisco :( I hope this isn't true"
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:55:26
The same thing is true for 90% of the people in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:29:17
Does that mean it's also absurd to say you support UASF, while at the same time opposing EC?
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:26:42
It's really hard to tl;dr this, but I'll give a very very very basic idea/guideline about what's going on:
SegWit and BU are two different approaches at shaping the future of Bitcoin (they do not *per se* exclude each other). Asicboost is just a way to make bitcoin mining more efficient, you can ignore it for now until you undestand the basics behind SegWit and BU.
Please be aware that it'll be almost impossible to get objective unbiased information on the SegWit vs BU debate on reddit. I recommend you check out both, this bitcoin subreddit and the btc subreddit. The truth is somewhere in between. Be careful whom you trust, there's a lot of shady stuff and propaganda going on on both sides.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:53:35
I was shocked about how such a manipulative and narrow-minded post could be upvoted to the hot page and even be gilded. Then I felt great relieve to find so many voices of reason among the comments. Thank you guys! My hopes for SegWit are still alive.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:43:17


Agreed. I don't give a fuck about Roger either. I also agree that we shouldn't give mindless trolls any attention.


The big problem is that this whole thing has turned into the pot calling the kettle black. There are so many lies, propaganda and baseless accusations flying around this sub, that get actively supported and spread by big names of the pro core side. Roger was not the only one that turned this into a political game, both sides are equally guilty of that. It may be hard to accept, but the side that we root for is not any better. Why can't we just stop blindly and mindlessly following big names, and start asking questions and thinking critically again?
Change can only happen if we change ourselves.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:51:39
Probably unpopular opinion: Samson is awful at promoting the ideas that he supports.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:29:09
This is wrong and no way to measure UASF support. I'm running a core node too and would love to see SegWit activated; I strongly reject UASF in its current state though.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:55:37
Took the survey as well.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:30:38
I haven't read up on Schnorr in detail yet, so I really have no idea.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:36:21
Unproven suspicions do not belong in a survey that tries to be objective at all.
And sorry, but your changed version is not objective either. I'm pro SegWit as well, but if a technical reason is valid or not is *always* subjective. There are 20+ mining pools and only **three** of them support SegWit. It's not Wu alone that blocks SegWit. More than 30% of miners do not signal *anything at all!* Of course it's hard to get a majority if a third of the miners doesn't vote, this is just as bad for BU as it is for us.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:35:55
I'm not him, but he's saying that **UASF** wasn't tested thoroughly.
And I fully agree with him, I support SegWit, but not UASF.
And I'm convinced that all the big companies that expressed their UASF support so fast do not completely understand what it is all about, and merely jumped aboard some sort of hype train.
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:05:56


While I'm a SegWit supporter and thus deem myself a Core supporter as well, this is the kind of (american?) over-the-top blind fanboyism that I don't get. It can be dangerous. Even if we support them, we should never stop criticizing and questioning them, their motives and ourselves. They are definitey *not* the brightest people on the planet, they're only regular humans like you and me, some of them might be taking a shit while I'm writing this.
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:52:45
I thought about that for a while now and think you're 100% correct. Users, miners and developers all want bitcoin to succeed. Yet we've been played off against each other, and progress is stalling ever since. Trying to find new ways to shove our opinions down each others throats (UASF) is not the way to go. Bitcoiners need to get off their high horses and give a fresh new start a chance. However, looking at this sub, I feel like it's too late.
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:07:59
The double standards in this open letter downright hurt when reading them.
I can't even... wtf man.    
If I know one thing for sure, it's that *this* is *not* how we're going to solve our communities problems.
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:39:10
did you consider this or may there be conflation of UASF and BIP148 in your list as well?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:43:11
It's not dumb but clever.
The more popular it becomes to use Bitcoin, the faster adaption and use cases will increase, thus increasing Bitcoins value.
Spend your Bitcoin on stuff and immediately buy new BTC. Increases demand as well.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:55:53
cringeworthy kindergarten tactics.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:14:55
I think you misunderstood.
Save as many Bitcoin as you want to!
You wanna save and hodl 3 BTC? Just buy 3.1 instead. Use the 0.1 BTC to buy stuff from time to time, but always replace the amount you spent as soon as possible, so that you can rebuy at the same price that you spent them for and don't have to pay extra.
It's not "either or", you can just do both!
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:10:12
Wow, this one is really low effort.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:49:41


That's not how compromises work, and there's no real reason to assume that compromises will get bigger every time

Yeah true, which is quite sad. Blockstream's actions are cringeworthy sometimes.

Samson Mow, the biggest dimwit in human history.
I always feel relieved when I read the comments here and see that this clown doesn't really have community support.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:17:45

I'd love to see a **Samson Mow** flair so I could filter that one out...
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:53:50
At least they tell you that you're banned.
Some of my most harmless comments got shadow-removed here without anyone telling me, just because they didn't follow this reddit's narrative I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:28:24


Ahaha omg wow, you really need a break from this subreddit echo-chamer if you seriously believe that opposing BIP148 is the *exception*.
You gotta leave this "cave" once in a while and take a look at the world outside.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:53:50
You must be the guy making those facebook pics saying "like this pic if you love your mother, scroll down and ignore if you want your mother to die". What if I told you that I'd always support SegWit but I'd never support the horrible idea of enforcing it via BIP148? Mind = blown? The world isn't as black and white as you want it to be.
