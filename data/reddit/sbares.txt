If only there was a word for that��

Reading very closely, I can get your comment to make syntactical sense, but the sense ends there, soz.

Evidently, yes they do. And their reasoning would be sound if the orders were real: If the order book is deeper in the right direction, then you are less likely to be margin called in the short term. Leading to additional margin trading in one direction, which leads us to:


They profit massively from the liquidation trades. 


No, lol, If the money they have is fake, then it is just that, *fake*. Printing 300,000,000 USDT does not make them 300,000,000 USD richer; using them to manipulate the market does (probably not by 300M$ but by some ammount).

Exchanges manipulating markets to liquidate margins.

For exchanges that let their costumers trade on margin, a sudden price jump in either direction is a guaranteed profit. There is *some* evidence that *some* echanges (*cough* bitfinex *cough*) use spoofing techniques, ie. create large fake buy/sell walls so people will think they can safely sell/buy on margin. Remove the wall, and optionally use some of the billions of fake dollars you have printed to move the price in the right direction, and voila, your very legitimate business made a shitload of cash from gullible fools. [Rinse and repeat](
Welcome to the unregulated market.

Incentive is a whole lot better when you are guaranteed to profit from it.


You vastly overestimate the intelligence of people who trade in such a volatile (and unregulated) market, let alone on margin.

"Only", lol. Liquidating millions of dollars worth of positions hardly generates negligible fees. They even charge an additional fee from the ones who are so kind (read: gullible) as to take the credit risk for them...


Using their insider position, they can guarantee that their bot will cancel the order before its executed. By extension, it needn't be a real order in the first place. Besides, risking fake money that you print yourself is hardly any risk at all.
EDIT: Oh and


Is pretty funny in multiple ways. You think I'd consider that, given me calling people who trade bitcoin idiots? You think I'd want to empty my piggy bank and take a loan to get 20 btc in the first place? You think I don't know exactly what will happen to my money? Bruh. Besides, I don't have to, there's plenty of historical order book data, of people/exchanges having done just that, only in actual bad faith.
