Yeah nothing but also the most popular U.S. exchange

But this is not something hard to do. This is what I am talking about. Assuming nobody was trying to cheat him, he could ask them nicely for his money and he would get it back if they are honest.
But if they are not honest, it's game over.

So there is no way to know the state of the channel if you have to go from a backup?
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:42:33
Can you tell me how to determine that your state is not outdated? It doesn’t even seem possible?
Say you backup from 10 sec ago. How to check if not outdated?

LN is not trustless

Wait so it wasn’t even user error then? There’s nothing he can do if the peer orchestrated or knew about the backup and wanted to take advantage of it?
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:08:21
Doesn’t matter because if his peers wanted to they could have screwed him over regardless once they realized he lost the current state.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:49:07
Should there be a way to close that can request a state from the peer and if both sides agree to that state, it can be closed, even if it wasn’t the final state.
I guess there would be other things to work out but it stops one from being trapped and tricked. If the peer refused to send a state you at least know they are trying to fuck you.

I bought a ~8$ Runescape (5$ + fee) membership from blackmarket trading site as a teen with bitcoin early 2010, I think March/April or so. I remember seeing the option pop-up, and then remembering my friend at school had "mined" some. He sold me what twice what I needed for the trade for 20$. (Told me it can only be mined on PC's and not on my e-mac.) So i can buy another code for later.
This was easier than what I had been doing, buying Itunes gift cards from the mall 5 miles away that I had to secretly bike to, selling them online, and buying the RS phone codes via paypal from sellers. I had very strict parents (but I had a computer and I had enabled root user that was hidden so their parental controls did not actually work.)
I used to to buy one month of membership, and left the rest in the wallet as I was able usually sustain by buying the phone codes/pins for 1-2 mil gp, but was just low on money that month.
Anyway. 8$ of BTC, even bought for 10$ in March/April of 2010 was lost with that e-mac. I think BTC was less than 0.01$ like half that.. so 8$ of BTC was more than a thousand BTC.
I think ATH value would be more money than my entire family has earned in their lifetime, combined.
My computer was then thrown away in June 2010 when I bought myself a new laptop for college with saved money, and it was not worth trying to sell.
Btw this friend suffered a similar fate with his few thousand BTC when his laptop died, and he got a new one as a present and just never bothered to save the few $ of BTC on it. He went to Community College, then learned Japanese, did 2 years abroad in Japan, finished a CS degree when he came back, and has never mentioned bitcoin on his facebook ever since.
Tl;DR: two teens threw away a few thousand BTC in the summer of 2010.

What the fuck. O R A C L E

You should be really careful about holding onto people's money for them. You can get into a lot of trouble if that money grows large. Just an FYI. If this takes off I would seriously recommend you to go speak to someone knowledgable in the financial services sector or at least in online payments.

Try adding some more popular social media instead of twitter. Twitter (supposedly) has as many active users as Reddit, though many(most) of those are of course bots. So imagine gating your login behind a Reddit account.
It's too limiting.
I know Google and Facebook have very standard one-click logins, for example. So does Twitch/Amazon I think for gaming related stuff.

I mean some people have twitter account named St3ve and others are named Steve, it doesn't make sense to ban St3ve or Steve if the other came first.
Also account activity is not a good way to weed out scammers as scammers would just make lots of free transactions between their own accounts to make it look like a highly active one.
