What if passwords where dynamic?
Like, you would set them with a graphical interface (similar to things like Yahoo Pipes or LabVIEW).
So your password could be something like: the first word of the Times on that day concatenated with the first word of the Guardian also on that day concatenated with the temperature in London at that time multiplied with the temperature in Paris  also at that time. This is just an example. You could configure your dynamic password to be whatever you wanted. You would have building blocks you could drag to a graphical canvas and you would wire them to hardwire the graphical password as you wanted.
Maybe the example I gave is a bit silly, I'm not very inspired but you get the idea. A dynamic password that you would set to have parameters that would be different every time you had to input the password.

Nice and concise but quite cliché oriented. Nothing new here. It lacks a bit of pepper and salt,,, I think.

This is not a 100% p2p app. The site could be shut down.

The only thing you can do right now is search on twitter for

The developers that did  and  must already be thinking of doing a good 'streams aggregator' for Stremium.

They should instead make bitcoin legal tender.

I like to explain it with an email analogy, where a copy of the sent email is also sent to all others to keep the virtual balance of everyone up to date. 
Everyone's mailbox gets part of a global spreadsheet that keeps the virtual balances updated.
Miners verify the transactions keeping the network secure and receiving as rewards bitcoins that enter circulation.
Bitcoins only exist as virtual balances associated with bitcoin addresses, as a result of previous transactions. What you need to keep is the private key of that address, that is like a password that allows you to spend your bitcoins.
