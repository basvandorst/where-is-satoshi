Apis are good for building things? I want to build this new idea.
I need a system that lets me know who paid who, when, how much, and can reject transactions that follow the rules. The blockchain does that.

The blockchain is established.  Most of the APIs I need to transfer value and track it are in place.  I have to write 90% less code by using the blockchain.

I have. 200 page book I'm putting out tomorrow that is much more specific.

Basically yes. Except that is a decay on money you hold now and in the future.  So if you move your money quickly you  1. Don't have to pay it, someone else does, 2. You get payments from the next guy down the line.
