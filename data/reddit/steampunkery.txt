I still think of Mycellium as that Minecraft block.

It's not. You asked for what current currency STARTED as a collectible. I have news for you. In the early 1900s and mid to late 1800s, silver was very much a currency in the US. Ever heard of a man named William Jennings Bryan? Maybe Google him sometime.

Oh I'm sorry, I don't carry my 700 pounds of gold around with me. We have this thing called paper money that's lighter but still carries value. 
"Wait! The gold standard doesn't exist anymore," you shout
Yeah that's because we'd need a metric shit ton of gold to back all the money in America. It's not possible. 
The original commentator is correct, most currencies START as a collectible and evolve from there. 
Bitcoin has value because we GIVE it value. It has no inherent value. Therefore, it's what? A COLLECTIBLE

Spoken like a true dumbass. How do we know there's no backdoor? BECAUSE WE CAN SEE THE DAMN CODE, YOU DIMWIT! Also on a similar note, Satoshi didn't create blockchains, dumbfuck.
