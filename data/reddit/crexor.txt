I'm confused as to why he keeps comparing it to the dollar, and that unlike the dollar it is not backed by gold and therefore it has no value. It's also scary to me that someone would take financial "advice" from someone who does not realize that it's not 1970 anymore.

It has not, for 40+ years now.

I LOVE that they used the same footage of Charlie.

I agree with you, he says bitcoin has no value, because there is no "gubment" backing, and no gold backing etc, and that its not a currency and that it needs "gold backing." I agree with him partially, because bitcoin behaves more like a commodity than a currency, but the only reason the dollar has any value is because people equate it to having value and being stable, that I can exchange x dollars for y number of product, I see no difference between that and bitcoin, except the lack of government involvement/regulation/protection, I can exchange goods and services for bitcoin, I can purchase gold and silver bullion with bitcoin, and I can trade bitcoin for dollars, yuan, yen, euro etc, I'm just confused at how this guy is some sort of financial analyst that anyone takes seriously, he changes his mind every other day about bitcoin, by his own argument, the dollar should be a bad investment, it has no gold backing and strictly government backing, and is subject to congress and the treasury meddling with reserve rates, bond rates etc, causing just as much need for concern.
