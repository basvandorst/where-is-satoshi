The exploit made use of the forum apparently. And I think that the forum users typically skew towards being high-volume pro traders. That's why the victims got scammed for some pretty ridiculous amounts. I was the first person to get scammed apparently and coincidentally I just happened to have the least in my wallet (.14btc). They reimbursed the victims (including myself) anyways but nonetheless luckily it was .14btc in my case and not more.
I tried alerting everyone on the forum but the forum would literally kick me out. lol.
I suspect someone in the hacker group (unless it was just one actor) had a decoy contact me. Because I was contacted by a client shortly before the hack. Literally 4 minutes after I replied to the client, I went to the dashboard or maybe the forum (I can't recall my steps 100%. I think I was about to turn my ads off for the night), I was prompted to "login", entered 2FA code once, error, entered it again and then I saw my balance was 0'd out. I forwarded that client's username, email address and phone number to LBC support to investigate.
It's probably unlikely that localbitcoins would be able to successfully prosecute a cyber-criminal internationally over $28,500 USD or whatever 7.95 BTC (the total sum of this hack) is worth. But who knows. If the hacker is sloppy enough, they could be traced with a court order. That person contacted me with a gmail address. Gmail has to be linked with a valid mobile phone number.

Someone else reported something exactly like this.

someone claimed to have lost 11 btc in one of the posts above but he didn't post the address. Unless he's trolling, this hack might be bigger than the 7.95btc that went to 13WaahhsiGph4ysmQtjVhVTdgQUSL62KJr
This scammer better watch his step from here. He hasn't moved his coins yet. He knows we're watching.

Not yet. Their forum seems to be down now too.

You were given $5,000 to buy and fund a bitcoin ATM? Dude this smells like a potential scam waiting to happen. Did you get paid via cheque, bank draft, email money transfer or something like that to buy bitcoin for a business or someone? This is a common scam.

I personally wouldn't keep my savings on a site like LBC. I kept .14BTC in my wallet because you need 0.04 BTC just to advertise. And advertisers like myself always need some bitcoin in their wallet for sale.
You don't need a Ledger or Trezor to store your BTC in cold. You can boot Tails from a USB offline. And sign transactions offline. And then broadcast them with a watch-only internet connected wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:22:45


And who do you think you're buying bitcoins from on there? Advertisers. Advertisers need to have a certain amount of bitcoin in their LBC account for sale. You need 0.04btc minimum in your wallet just to advertise on localbitcoins. I only had .14btc in my wallet at the time luckily but sometimes I get buyers who want to do $1,000 orders so I usually keep about $1,000-1,500 in my wallet. Some of my clients trade with me out of escrow because they trust me. But typically buyers do not want to trade off-site for fear of getting scammed so you need to deposit some btc on the site. It's not recommended to keep your life savings on an online wallet. I have cold storage for that.

My account was the first that got compromised and I had 2FA enabled. It was a man in middle attack. The attacker found an exploit in localbitcoins' third party forum software. When you go to the forum, the attacker hijacks your browser and changes what you see on the screen to fool you into thinking that you are being asked to login again (LBC periodically logs you off as a security measure). When in fact the attacker is sending you straight to your LBC wallet on the back end and the 2FA code you enter is for withdrawing the bitcoins to the attacker's wallet. This is hidden from your view. What you seen on your screen is a fake decoy login page. Presumably with a url similar to localbitcoins.
The media reported it was a phishing attack and this is not accurate since there was no log of the attacker's IP in my login history. Another user on LBC also confirmed the same thing. This was a javascript injection browser man in middle attack. This type of exploit has been done before in a different way before - it would change the QR codes on exchanges to the QR code of the attacker's bitcoin address.
The only way to prevent this kind of attack is to look closely at the url or look at the SSL certificate before you login/enter 2fa (or grab a bitcoin address/qr code since that is another common man in middle attack). You have to know what the website's real SHA-256 SSL fingerprint in the first place in order to cross-reference for authenticity though. I have lbc bookmarked and never go to google to find localbitcoins  (since this could lead you to accidentally going to a phishing site) so I figured that the odds of being phished were 0. But if a part of the website has vulnerable code (like third party software) or if the DNS itself has been compromised, then you can still be attacked. A nice short cut I think would be to bookmark every login page, every withdrawal page, every deposit page, etc. so that you can quickly look for the bookmark star before you enter your credentials or make a withdrawal.

I safely withdrew the bitcoins to my private wallet so the site seems secure (but who knows really). I screencapped and copy and pasted LBC's SHA-256 and SHA-1 fingerprint for future reference.
SHA-256 Fingerprint	3F 27 74 3F 81 B9 68 A9 CE BA 42 4E E1 EF FD C3
8A 77 D4 28 DC 2C F7 A7 8D 7F C7 FE 7C B9 D7 D2
SHA-1 Fingerprint	79 7D 3C 8A 74 6D 39 A7 A9 EB 50 97 D1 55 2A 62 30 44 AC 83
LBC has been light on the details but I think to prevent this attack in the future what you need to do is click on the padlock icon to the left of https:// then see if it says "connection is secure" and certificate (valid). Then click on certificate (valid) and cross-reference the fingerprints with the ones above. This is assuming that the attacker was able to exploit the third party forum software and having the forum link redirect you to a cloned phishing site in order to man in middle attack you to steal your credentials.
I would advise that if you are going to login to ANY site where you have crypto inside, you should grab their ssl fingerprints and save them in a text file and print them on a piece of paper. then before you logon to each site you should cross-reference the ssl fingerprints to make sure that you aren't being phished.

Yeah I think I was the first to get cleaned out. 0.14btc. 5 victims going to one wallet. And that's just one wallet we know about that belongs to the attacker.

It was definitely a server-side hack and not a phishing site since my login history on LBC does not show any other IPs but my own. If the hacker logged on with my credentials, then their IP would show. I got hacked 4:42 AM EST and this doesn't show on the login history at all. Only the transaction history.

Really? Brave browser actively kills trackers, ads and upgrades you to https whenever possible (handy as sometimes sites don't default to https, which can be potentially dangerous if you are on a site with sensitive info or financial transactions). And monitors malware/phishing (obviously it's not going to be perfect for this). Brave has optional "Brave ads".
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:03:17
11 btc? Post the address and txid please. We need to track down this fucker.
I thought it was just 5 victims related to that one address. but it looks like there may be multiple wallets.

There is a Meta Mask extension for Brave explorer as well. Not just Chrome. If you don't want to use Chrome. Brave is more private and secure. I think you should be able to import your Meta Mask seed from Chrome to the Brave version.
Some of my online banking doesn't like Brave and my Proxy doesn't have an extension for Brave so I don't use it all the time.
I'm happy that Ledger is moving away from Chrome because of the javascript man in middle attack vulnerabilities that change your deposit address (you can tell if the deposit address is legit by checking to see if the address on your screen matches up with the address on your device's lcd screen). There are man in middle attacks that change your copy and paste too so you have to be vigilant as well when sending crypto from your PC.

Yeah Brave is based on Chrome software. Except it disables trackers, ads, etc. Chrome works with my online banking but Brave does not even through Brave is Chrome-based. So it must be disabling some sort of cookie/tracker that my bank uses.
