I don’t have $16k...

I did not know that. Thank you.
Is mining even viable anymore? Or could I get anything at all mining with a laptop or pc I build at home while I’m on the road at work? (I’m a trucker so I’m never home.)

What’s this? And why does it have a screen?
I’m new to cold storage.

No shit. I wish I had one.

Now THAT shit seems complicated

How do I get into this to at least gain even my returns back? I could change my life with one damn coin....
I gotta do something.

Is trying to mine anything with any laptop or pc I can build even worth while? I’m gone for work a lot but can easily set this up to run while I’m gone.

Literally one coin could change my damn life...
How the hell do I get into this to try and get ANYTHING at this point...?
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:07:08

My head just asploded.

I will have to do just that, Good sir. I am now going to tag you as 'Connoisseur of Bacon'
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:09:28
I love your stuff!
But seeing your new ad on the front page made me really wonder, as I have never actually thought about it before...
"How does one MAIL bacon!?"

The biggest dream I have is to be able to cash this out before fuckin cancer takes my ass.
Like, I wish...WISH...i had $5k i could take out right now cause there is a motorcycle that looks like my dream bike I found and the dude only wants $5k for it.
I checked my bitcoin and im a bit of the ways off :(
But someday...I hope im able to make it to the day where I have enough to cash out and ride once again before its too late.
If not, Im going to end up finding someone to give my keys to under the condition that when they cash out...they buy a bike and ride with me in spirit...
