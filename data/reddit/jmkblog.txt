Norway wants to be cashless by 2020
Other Nordic countries incl. The Netherlands are thinking along those lines as well.

This isn't about encryption or terrorism,  but about the elites' total apocalyptical fear they will no longer be able to control the masses. Time to revolt against the elites then.

This whole article is a straw-man argument. Allowing  bootleg copies of a Hollywood film would destroy Hollywood dominance and spur independent entertainment. Big-budget films, whose sole purpose is to maximize the producer's profits, would no longer be made, but much better films would be, for smaller audiences. By NOT oppressing conflicting freedoms humanity as a whole wins creativity.
This article exists to sell another shitcoin.

This is a nonsense comparison, because Madoff was eventually caught and sent to jail. The Evo admins need to get caught and go to jail. Stop pretending Bitcoin crimes are negligible.

Ah - that's explains where this [investment]( went. You're making music videos. I think your priorities are wrong.

I'm surprised. Why a crowd-fund now? They had two investment rounds previously, among others from Roger Ver etc. It just means their burn rate is too high and they don't generate any income. I know Bitcoin companies that actually make money. Don't invest.
