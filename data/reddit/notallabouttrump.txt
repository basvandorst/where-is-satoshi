The one about the mod
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:45:47
Interesting, thank you for your response
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:48:02
Yeah and you don't even want to post or comment in fear of backlash. And it's like hey look here you pretentious know it all motherfuckers most of you (*"not a single one of you" *-&gt; this is a mistake and over generalization on my part) have not been able to politely respond in a semi detailed fashion without throwing emotions and their own opinions in the mix.
It's a hard question to some degree but it seems like everyone has just settled on their realities with a lack of tangible evidence and logical lines of reasoning. Maybe I've missed all posts or comments about what in reality from premise to conclusion makes a crypto the real bitcoin. But it seems to me at some point there's just a leap of faith covered by an overwhelming amount of confirmation bias on either side. I would like to know whether or not I will have to make a similar educated leap of faith or if my reality what bitcoin truly is can be factually and logically supported.
*and fixing a stupid generalization that arose from heat of passion rather than critical thinking. Thanks to others who contributed to this thread and left emotion and pretentiousness out of it.

I didn't mean irrefutable completely. I just meant ones I lacked the knowledge to know what the true reality of the situation is
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:10:04
Would you say there is not enough actual evidence to reach a true conclusion? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:05:38
So if I post some comments from r/btc could you refute them for me?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:35:11
So I've seen the exact opposite response on r/btc. Who actually forked? Was segwit also not some sort of corporate take over?
And btw I'm not taking sides I really want to clear things up for myself as well as all the people I inform on the subject. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:31:06
That's not the factual evidence I'm looking for 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:50:59
Lol not in this thread of comments. It's funny because you definitely added good info above but are representing the people you say I belong with right now. I think you should calm down a little and take it easier on people just seeking some truth...that also happen to be leaning your way. Help the community out don't demonize knowledge deficits. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:18:35
Ah okay, I saw that being explained, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:14:03
Here's a link to the thing I'm talking about 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:33:36
Interesting, what's the major drawbacks? I don't find the argument and scare tactics they're espousing about chain death to likely occur
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:17:15
Better yet want their wallet addresses? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:33:36
Sorry but I want my reality to be based on real tangible evidence not some feelz you have. Sorry you couldn't give any actual arguments
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:37:48
How does your first point affect which coin is the real bitcoin? 
I'm not trying to be a dick and it can come across that way when written in text, so my apologies for the first response. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:35:23
I'll give it a listen 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:03:26
I highly appreciate your contribution to the thread and the information you've provided to me. My comment is of a general sentiment from "know-it-all" I've seen from both subreddits. 
I'm just expressing my feeling as well as others in how they are addressed for just not knowing something or asking a question.
Sorry if I was seemingly directing it a you. I'll edit the post.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:13:05
What are the implications of an attack? Could you expand a little more so I can understand the point better? Thanks
I also won't be doing business with coin base anymore because who comes out with a statement one day saying x then the next day saying not x, actually you. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:56:42
I hope most others in the community would reject your nasty sentiment. It's remarkable how salty one individual can be when nothing occurred besides them seeing non offensive, help seeking text on the internet. Glad you had to exert any energy to respond to me today. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:04:16
Lol you must have fucked her to death no worries though cause my aunt's are still ready to have fun. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:47:10
So would this be the only actual definitive source of settling the argument or is there a structured argument with evidence someone could present which could lead to a stronger foundation of the real reality of bitcoin? Thanks for the reply btw
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:00:36
This would be better as a train. Ethical dilemma meme
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:31:51
Thanks for the reply gives me some reference. Would Satoshi be the one who could actually settle the debate? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:35:03
Could you explain why this might be wrong? 
"So what factors at the heart of bitcoin make it bitcoin?
The only two are that it uses the genesis block and has the most accumulated work. That is the entire definition for what is bitcoin.
What makes me VALUE bitcoin is much longer.
The 21 million cap being at the top. Of course if miners ever tried increasing the cap a fork would form to keep it, that fork would (with 99.9999999% chance) become the most valuable and therefore gain the most hash rate. Thus being "bitcoin"."
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:30:54
Well you can actually use the scientific process at a low level to validate some Einstein's claims. But beyond that giving up so easily leaves me with little hope for actually reaching a factual reality rather than one based on confirmation bias.
You say there are 3 pillars. Someone else told me two.. Which is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:03:28
I've read plenty of retarded stuff on. R/Bitcoin albeit less but it's still there. Like your comment now, retarding the progress of a real discussion... 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:44:57
I know a lot more than the average person on bitcoin, and I'd say most people on these subreddits make me seem like an average person. So I'm asking from a perspective of a lay person. 
What defines what bitcoin truly is? And why does this distinction lead to bitcoin and bitcoin cash?
It's like being hit with propaganda that is reality shifting. I went over to r/btc and read some points that outright I couldn't refute after being a subscriber and avid reader on r/Bitcoin. If a semi knowledgeable person can be led astray from an accurate reality then how can we ever expect lay persons to know the difference?
