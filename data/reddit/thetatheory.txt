Filled out the form as requested, Charity is to help families of organ donors.  Very often the donor recipients (like me) have many avenues for assistance.  But the families that suddenly lose someone often see that loss of income, and little to no life insurance, and funeral costs, making paying the bills difficult or impossible.   The registered charity I volunteer with/for helps take care of these families - paying these bills for them when needed, ensuring they can go on.

This is why I sold before the big lift and am not mad I didn’t make it filthy rich. 
I don’t believe in it, in its current state. 
It’s too difficult to use.  There aren’t failsafes that the general public needs.  There are just too many things keeping it from being a successful mainstream or even sub stream currency.  
It’s a volatile stock.  Nothing more.  It’s how it’s being used and I s the only reason it’s moving in price - hype.  NOT belief in its purpose as a currency.

Now tell Susan that and see what she says.  Or if her eyes glaze over.  
And why that's better than a plastic card in her wallet that is accepted at almost every place worldwide, and she has zero liability and will be reimbursed if it is stolen.

I don't think you understood my post.  It's not that I don't understand it. It's that the average joe can't use it.  And until he can, it will remain a fringe item.  
Read the posts in this thread alone and there's so much bank apocalypse talk.  Bad comparisons too (email and Cars have never been hard to use, not even in infancy). 
The issue with bitcoin is and will continue to be its ease of use.

I don't think to the same extent.  
But sure let's say that's true.  Someone went and made it easy for the dumbest people to use.  Go do that with bitcoin.   
But instead every discussion of full of jargon, new words and terms weekly, and no standard or agreement.  
Even google can't get people to use their wallet solution.

US.  Btc is in Coinbase.

If the transaction comes from Coinbase?
