Ah I was worried about that pretty much all I wanted to know. If network usuals is still up I’m guessing fees are still high which completely ruins satoshi nakamotos goal of it being a currency. Kinda makes me sad I’m just holding for the fun of it at this point not going to expect gains. Anytime soon at least.

Mainstream media and person blogs contain extreme bias. On one scale they hate it or it’s a individual who’s hodling but panicking and writing why they think bitcoin will go skyrocketing again. So I just wanted to get it straight from the source. There isn’t exactly a crypto currency catch up sub reddit so I decided to post it on here if you don’t agree with what I have to ask or say or simply are to lazy to help a guy out move in with your day this isn’t the post for you. It’s that simple buddy boy.

Have you seen “legit news sources” they lie over exaggerate or under exaggerate stories depending on what one will get them more clicks. 
I want to get it yes from strangers but people who have stuck around while it’s in the dump so I could see if there was any good news.
But yeah I can tell it’s all lows I’m only hodling at this point to help satoshies dream but it’s pretty much dead at this point but who knows many people have said what I’m saying know befor the boom always a chance it will come back even if it hits $1 which is extremely unlikely.
