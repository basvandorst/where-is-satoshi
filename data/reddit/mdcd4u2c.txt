It's not supposed to, it's supposed to be a hedge against fiat currencies losing value by retaining it's own value. My point was it's stupid to look at some arbitrary number of bitcoin 5 years ago, calculate what it would be worth today, and then claim it's the biggest bet ever. If I had bet someone 1 oz of gold in 1600, that bet would be worth £1,000 today, versus about £1 back then. That doesn't mean anything. 
People in the crypto subs really just live in their own little world.

Wow... this is just plain wrong on so many levels. Not only is the source article comparing 3 year old currency data with the most recent bitcoin data, but they're comparing literal notes in circulation (M0) with all bitcoin ever mined. So basically, tailoring the data to fit a narrative.
IMF provides quarterly data on all the currencies the article talked about so there's no reason to use 2015 data, and M2 is the actual amount of money that can be used in the economy, not M0. If you're going to use only M0, you have to also then account for bitcoin that has been lost forever, but even then it's not a legitimate comparison.

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:50:51
Let me hold your hand through this like you're holding on to your bitcoins:
So said the following:


You see, the author here first tells you that he agrees there is a clear inequality in BTC holders. You can tell this is what the first sentence is about because the [Gini coefficient]( is how economic disparity is measured by some. Then, he provides you with a counter-argument, the crux of which is to say that BTC "one percenters" (my words, not his) are different than fiat one percenters because of a fundamental ideological difference. Though this is the foundation of his argument, he builds on it by explicity stating that BTC one percenters would like to "make BTC work." This is clearly a subjective term, your idea of "working" is different than mine, but the definition of the word is not important in the context of my rebuttal to him:


Here, I argue that much like BTC one percenters have a vested interest the BTC "working," banks have a vested interest in the USD working. I'm drawing a parallel here. Notice--I did not say he was wrong, I simply stated that his argument is moot because he is implying some difference in the motivations of fiat one percenters and BTC one percenters, while I am saying they are all human, and as a group, will behave like all other humans. 
Go ahead, take a second to really let that sink in, you'll need it for this next part! 
Okay, got it? Great! You're doing just fine. :)
Following my comment, replied:


So we have another piece of the puzzle here. The author is now illustrating what his idea of BTC "working" would entail. As you read the rest of his quote, you have to remember that we assume he's talking about BTC one percenters because it would be logical to continue talking about the same people you've been talking about thus far unless otherwise stated. Anyway, the author claims that the BTC one percenters want more people to have BTC because of their [kindness]( He then illustrates the types of things these one percenters may do, such as send BTC to oppressed peoples. 
With me so far? Buckle up, we're going to start getting into the weeds here!
I replied:


Here, I made use of a seldom used literary technique known as "sarcasm," which some of the more advanced readers can spot by my excessive use of ellipses and overall tone of argument. As such, you have to assume the things I argued here are *counter* to the point I am actually trying to make. Therefore, since I said that BTC owners *are* a new breed that *don't* have self-interest and common human motivations, you have to assume that what I'm *actually* saying is that they *are not* a new breed and they *do* have the same self-interest and motivations. 
Feel free to stretch your legs at this point, I know that last bit was tough to get through.
So to quickly summarize our argument:








Now this is where *you* jumped into the argument and said:


This was tough for me to decipher, and do you know why? Your first sentence states that I do not have faith in people, yet your next few sentences tell me to start a "humanitarian coin," which, most would argue, requires faith in people (not only to carry out some humanitarian task, but to adopt the coin). You can see my confusion here--do I not have faith in people, or do I?
Regardless, I didn't want to argue semantics, so I "read between the lines" and followed up with:


Here, I argue that the motivations of normal rich people and BTC rich people will be the same, and so they are likely to act in the same fashion, despite what one may claim about ideological differences. Then I followed up with some more sarcasm, but see if you can decipher it on your own!
You followed up with a counter-argument (though I use that term loosely here):


Any normal reader now may be confused because you imply in your comment that I have been arguing *for* communism or some sort of equality drenched utopia (feel free to look up that word if you need to). Yet, not only did I never argue *for* equality, I explicitly stated, several times, that BTC will not achieve any sort of "equality" in the same way that fiat currency cannot do so. Are you with me?
Go ahead and just sleep on all of this tonight and really internalize it. Once you do that, I think you'll come to the same conclusion I came to: you're a fucking dumbass.

The value of the dollar goes down because of inflation, hence the value of the nominal amount of USD you paid in taxes went down also, so there's no need to add a deduction. You're paying the same in taxes as you would had the dollar not inflated but you're paying with less valuable currency.

Aa for your gold asteroid....... If we're hedging against the most ridiculous of tail risks like a surprise asteroid attack, Bitcoin had quite a bit more plausible risk associated with it. What if an EMP knocks out the grid during some kind of conflict and the vast majority of people are unable to access their Bitcoin?

Is your argument that USD without gold backing isn't as sound as bitcoin with the backing of... no one? I'm not arguing that bitcoin doesn't have some value, but if the only thing that gave currency value was what was backing it, bitcoin doesn't have a leg to stand on.


You mean like bitcoin hard forks? When each person that owns 1 bitcoin is also given 1 bitcoin cash, or 1 bitcoin gold, or 1 bitcoin private, that is the same as inflation. Just because bitcoin has a hard limit on the number of coins that will be produced does not make it immune to inflation, since as we've seen, an unlimited number of forks can occur. If, instead of letting the USD inflate by printing more USD, the government and Fed decided they were going to credit people who have USD with a new currency called Dollar Gold, that would still be inflation. A rose by a different name.


Why do you think that's a bad thing. Is it because that's what you hear from people or have you actually thought it through? Because I've spent a lot of time thinking about it. I don't mean to be argumentative, but I'm asking anyone reading this comment to step outside of what you've *heard* and **really** think about it. Come to your own conclusion, but here's my opinion (included some definitions for those who may not have heard of/looked into other terms concerning inflation/deflation) with sources where necessary.
1. Inflation - a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.
2. Deflation - reduction of the general level of prices in an economy and an increase in the purchasing value of money.
3. Disinflation - reduction in the *rate* of inflation.
4. Reflation - the act of stimulating the economy by increasing the money supply or by reducing taxes, seeking to bring the economy (specifically price level) *back up to the long-term trend*, following a dip in the business cycle.
5. Stagflation - persistent high inflation combined with *high unemployment and stagnant demand* in a country's economy.
6. Equity - the value of an asset less the amount of all liabilities on that asset.
The general argument against fiat in most crypto subs is inflation, i.e. the fall in purchasing power of traditional fiat currency. I'm coming at this from the perspective of living in the USA, because, well, that's where I live. However, it should apply to most *developed* countries. We're a debt-based, consumer-driven economy. Comparing to other developed countries, we are generally towards the [bottom of the list when it comes to savings]( Therefore, when inflation occurs, we're losing value on a relatively small sum of money that we choose to save (as a cohort). 
On the other hand, when inflation *does* occur, it also means that by definition, asset prices increase. You can [see the relationship between the two]( So while you're losing purchasing power on the 3-8% (8% is the peak savings rate for the US that we haven't hit since the G Depression) you're saving in cash, you're gaining the same percentage on your assets. The biggest asset for American households is their home, worth orders of magnitude more than the amount of cash they have. So would you take a 2% hit from inflation on the 3% of total assets you have in cash to get a 2% boost on the 70%+ of total assets you have in the form of your home? I sure as hell would.
I've heard people argue that you don't really get to benefit from this asset appreciation since you don't technically own your home until it's paid off. Okay, fine, let's talk about it in the context of equity. Home equity is the value of your home minus the outstanding balance on your mortgage, it's the fraction of your home that you actually own. The amount of money you owe on your home is locked in during closing. Whether the home appreciates in value or depreciates, the amount you owe is the amount you owe. So if the *value* of the home rises but you still owe the same amount to the bank, your *equity* gets the full benefit of the increase in value. 
But let's assume you don't have a home, you're a millennial like me. In that case, most of your "assets" *are* your cash holdings. Then you have no reason to want inflation right? It's not that simple. As I said before, we're a *debt-driven* country. For example, I have tons of student loans, as do most people on this sub that are in my age range. Inflation means that I can borrow $10 today, and pay you back $11 tomorrow. But in that same time-span, the value of the dollar has fallen, so the $11 tomorrow is worth the same as $10 today. So essentially, borrowers benefit from inflation because they get to pay back loans with depreciated dollars tomorrow, yet they get to enjoy the fruits of the value of the dollar *today*. Again, [inflation ends up being a net benefit if you have no real assets to speak of, as long as you're borrowing money]( I'm sure you've heard that Apple has some $200 bln+ in *cash*, so why would they be [borrowing money]( There's a few reasons, but one of them is that they know that we're approaching an inflationary environment, and they can borrow now and essentially get an interest-free loan, so why not?
Let's talk about deflation. Deflation is the rise in the purchasing power of currency, which, by definition, means a fall in asset values. So apply everything from the last two paragraphs in reverse. You get a 2% rise in the purchasing power of the cash sitting in your savings account, coinciding with a 2% fall in the value of your other assets, which make up a larger percentage of most people's total assets. If you own a home, that means that your *equity* decreases. If you owe student loans, you'll be paying them back with currency worth more than it was when you borrowed it. Deflation is a net benefit for lenders, while inflation is a net benefit for borrowers. 
So let's conduct a thought experiment. Let's assume there's a mass adoption of Bitcoin as the world's primary currency. We know that the number of BTC has a hard limit on it, so by definition, the more that people start using bitcoin, the higher its value goes because supply is inelastic while demand is growing. That's deflation. That means the people who have bitcoin and are able to lend it out will be net beneficiaries, while those of us who have to borrow will lose. 
I saved the most controversial for last. Inevitably, someone will bring up the fact that the top x% of global elites owns z% of the world's wealth, so they get to benefit more from inflation than any of us. While this is true, inflation isn't a zero-sum game, i.e. the amount you or I could benefit from inflation is not effected by the amount someone else gets to benefit from it. This is why things like the housing boom in the early 2000's were able to occur and sustain for so long. *Everyone's* home values increased, not just the top x%. This entire argument is about [labor-share of corporate income]( not inflation. One isn't dependent on the other--we've had a [long-term decline in labor-share in the US regardless of whether we had high/low inflation]( This argument is not for or against bitcoin despite the number of times it's brought up on various forums. Wages and inflation don't seem to be linked [by the Fed's own admission]( or if they *used* to be linked, they no longer are.
I realize this went from one and two liner arguments to a novel, not because I have anything against the commenter I'm replying to, but I had some free time and figured I'd use it to point out a few things that consistently get overlooked here. Take from it what you will.
Edit: I said that 8% was the peak savings rate for the US post-Great Depression, which was incorrect after looking it up. The peak was 15%, although still following the Depression. [Source](

Your statement and the graph don't say the same thing. Your statement implies there have been 3817 days where the price was higher than the preceding day, which clearly is not the case.
Using the logic of the point you were *trying* to make, which is to say how many days has the price of Bitcoin been lower than the current price versus higher, you could present similar statistics about *a lot* of assets because most assets that last 10+ years spend most of their time going up.

If you skim the actual paper and not the garbage link OP posted, it looks like they're basing their estimates for how much hashrate is concentrated to any given region based on the price of the electricity in that region. So while they have data showing *x* hashrate in all of China, the more granular estimates are, at best, a guess.
This methodology makes little sense unless you assume that electricity is the *only* cost of mining, *and* an existing miner is able to either move their operations to where electricity is cheapest at a given time, or temporarily wind down their operation in a more expensive region while another miner in a cheaper region ramps it up.
Obviously, this is likely not how things are playing out in the real world. But it's written in the form of a paper and 99.9% of the people aren't going to read past the pro-BTC headline, so...
Edit: it also looks like they assume that where a market has 90% of it's electricity produced by renewables, that 90% of the mining is done via renewable energy. There's literally no reason to think that this is true. In fact, it's pretty likely that miners are geographically concentrated around one another for the same reason that you see warehouses in cities concentrated in one area of town. Most likely, they concentrate where the electricity is cheapest, which actually helps the authors main argument since 100% of miners in an area with 60% renewable energy could be using renewables. However, like the rest of the paper, they're just guessing.

Thanks for the comment. 
You clearly understand CDOs and CDSs so it's nice to not have to get into that, but where your argument becomes flawed, I think, is when you talk about Fannie and AIG taking on the risk because the American people are (essentially) powerless to stop it even if they knew it was going on. While it may be *partially* true, if you look back at data from that time, banks themselves were huge sellers of CDSs. They made up 67% of the market according to that article, which I have no reason to doubt. I think there was even a part in Big Short where they talked about JPM being on both sides of the trade unknowingly (could be wrong, it's been a while since I saw it). Anyway, you had financial powerhouses like [Barclays, JPM, and Goldman]( with huge exposure to the short side of the CDS trade. 
Granted, they were acting as market makers based on most articles I've read, but if they *knew* that the bottom could fall out on these things, there's no way they would take on that kind of risk even transiently because *when* shit hits the fan there would be no one to buy back the CDSs from. It's the same as the XIV debacle last month, once the contango broke and people saw the feedback loop that was going to occur, there were no sellers of VIX futures left and it spiked massively within minutes. The difference is that VIX is a relatively old measure that everyone knows mean reverts, whereas MBSs (and consequently CDOs and CDSs built on top of them) were not as well understood.
To use your analogy, Clinton and Greenspan (although I would place the blame on only Greenspan) did insure all this nonsense using taxpayer dollars, but their buddies at JPM and Goldman were also doing the same thing. Where the taxpayer got screwed was *after* everything went down when Bernanke agreed that the taxpayer would take on the losses that all of Greenspan's buddies were holding. I'm conflicted on that because on the one hand, it's a moral hazard to bail them out, but on the other hand, if they *weren't* bailed out, the American people may very well have suffered ever more than they did. I say this because I think that if some of the banks at risk had to dissolve, it would likely have rippled to consumer-facing banks and people would have outright lost their savings in a matter of weeks as opposed to just their jobs.

And honestly, if running a few commercials was enough to convince people to go take out *hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt*, those people got a very education on the reality of personal finance.


Here's an idea, if you don't actually know what happened, don't stand so firmly behind your views because you could be wrong. The banks packaged loans *in general* into mortgage backed securities so that institutions like your parent's pension fund could invest in home mortgages. At the time home mortgages in America were seen as one of the safest investments in the world aside from US Gov't bonds and a few other assets. They were so widely seen as safe *by everyone*, not just the banks, that people who spoke up about the possible risks were ridiculed. Again, this was by *everyone* not just the banks. [Government agencies]( were aware, [random bloggers]( warned us about it, [university publications]( talked about it, and even some of the most [successful hedge fund managers *ever*]( warned the public about it. 
This idea of "bad loans" being packaged together and sold to unwitting investors is also misleading and just popularized by pop culture (The Big Short?) as the *cause* of the collapse, but that's not completely true. It wasn't the fact that there were bad loans in MBS that was the issue, it was the fact that people assumed that none of the bad loans would default at the same time. If you were correct in thinking that banks were intentionally misleading the public into thinking these investments were safe when they know they weren't, why would the banks have had such [large holdings]( of what they knew to be bad investments themselves? Maybe it's not that they knew these were bad--maybe they thought, like everyone else, that American housing would never see a systemic and highly correlated collapse across the entire nation. 
That's not to say that there weren't *some* people who knew what they were doing was wrong, but the vast majority of people, including those on Wall Street, thought this was a win win. It would let investors get access to a highly stable asset class to invest in while allowing them to get loans of their books to free up capital to lend more. 
This is what I mean about about the attitude people have of blaming the rich without knowing what actually happened. I mean blame them for everything they did wrong, but you can't offload the irresponsibility of the entire American populous on one group because we were so dumb that "banks convinced people they could afford to get loans above their means." I'm sorry but if you convince me that snake oil is a good investment, I'm as much to blame for my decision to invest in it as are you.

Are you going to blame the government for your losses in crypto if they decide to regulate and the bottom falls out? I mean sure, they played their part but you know the risks when you put your money in. People who bought houses they couldn't afford should have known better. Banks should have known better. The government should have seen it coming. No one is free from blame but this attitude of blame the rich because we struggle to make do is a load of shit.

I don't need a better idea, I'm not arguing for Bitcoin l. Regardless, you're missing the point. You're arguing that you'll make tons of fiat money by investing in Bitcoin, then you say fiat will fail which negates the first argument.

Well, you can see how Coinbase's own estimation without any supporting evidence would be less than convincing. Talking their own book and what not. I mean, of course he's not going to be like "yea, there's not much demand, we're kind of just hoping for the best TBH"

The cumulative volume in the last year is more than the cumulative volume of all the previous years that are on trading view *combined*.

I think QE is an absolute shitshow, but please explain to me how QE is the reason that people's savings are dying? Inflation? The thing that the Fed can't hit it's 2% target on despite desperately trying since the GFC? People's savings are dying because they can't find work, which is a different problem than the printing of money. People's savings are dying because they're *still* spending beyond their means. This time it's not on mortgages, it's on fucking [*credit cards*](


I wouldn't call 95% of the people on the bitcoin sub or any crypto sub a capitalist. 


I agree, but not because they were they *only* ones at fault which is what everyone seems to believe. See my other [comment](

So... You're doing math to portray that the price of Bitcoin can only go up, but then you follow it up with "fiat always fails," which begs the question: if the goal is protection from fiat, why is the supporting argument the future price of Bitcoin in fiat currency? Both reasons for buying into BTC are valid (read: valid, not smart), but the two are mutually exclusive.

You people are really delusional. Using a website called "token enthusiast" as a source for claiming some movement like a "brain drain" is occurring, and even the source itself could only muster up 5 anecdotal cases of the thing they claim is happening. To top it all off, 4 of the 5 departures are related to one another....

Yeah sure but I have no way to tell if there was supervision or not so idk how it would even work
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:39:29
Why's that

That's the point though, it's not as easy as you think. It's one thing for someone on Reddit to be able to figure it out, another for someone who is 40+ and rarely uses phones/computers outside of email, news, and talk and text.

Yes, asteroid mining. This is the reason Bitcoin will be better than gold. Asteroid mining. Mining of space rocks. Are you guys self aware? Is this now a parody sub? I can never tell anymore.
