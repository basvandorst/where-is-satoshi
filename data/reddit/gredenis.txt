Oh yeah that was one too.
What I was referencing though was from max 2 weeks ago who had last year or so 2-3k Bitcoin  (he had more but spent apparently some) and fell a victim to btc theft.

You gotta bump up those numbers, those are rookie numbers!

Yup. There was a story while back on reddit about a guy who committed suicide and Bitcoin was probable reason why.
I though about if I'd bought, say, 4000 bitcoins for 30 cents each, I'd like to think I'd sold 1000 for $5 each, 1000
At $100 each, 1000 at $1000 each, 950 at $10000 each and rest to just see how far it'd go.
I might not have done this but at least there is logic (you get your investment back, and you still get decent return if Bitcoin never made it past $100.

I wanted to start invest in Bitcoin in early 2015.
My company went bankrupt in March 2015 and I couldn't find a job until September 2017. So needless to say, I don't own any bitcoin.
I am a little salty, but I know it's just money and there will be a new opportunities in the future.

I don't think about it at all. My salty is more of "I wanted to buy something in sale but when I went to store it was already sold out" salty :P
Plus on the positive note I got after almost 2 years of being jobless my dream job and my salary is incredibly good so I'm running on high spirits.

There hasn't been any gains, as of yet. The initial investment was 30k, return of investment is currently at ~30k, so unless it's completely different in US, there's no taxes to be paid?

Given your chance of huge payout, I would advice seeing a tax advisor just to make sure. Any information over the internet can be false / not applicable in your state, so play safe, pay for a counsel and be on the safe side and enjoy your small fortune :)
