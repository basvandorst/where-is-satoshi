How is that relevant to being/ not being a ponzi scheme, or legitimizing bitcoin more than any other seller or distributor?
It only shows  that the government simply recognizes bitcoin.

Go on, is there more to the story? Why do you do that?  Do they ask about it from a technological point of view, or more about the idea and reasoning of it? Either way, seems like a long way to give an answer.

Was he being sincere/ genuine when he said it? Colbert's humor is heavily based on sarcasm and low key satire. He may say something that really is happening, but you only know he's being sarcastic by his context. With Colbert, there's the literal meaning of what he says, but it's usually said in a way to.make it sound ridiculous. 
For this statements, reading just the quote with no context, it can possibly be taken two ways.
1. Making fun of "it's from the internet" as a reasoning that it works. Taking a stab at how people can be tricked by something because "it's from the internet".
2. A stab at banks. The reason we all agree with, the true reason that Bitcoin has a chance to survive, because of validity of regular banks.
While I assume Colbert is open minded enough to accept BTC, and recognize it's potential, to most people it is still "something from the internet".

Serious question... 
So I understand capital gains and if you were to sell all your bitcoins for profit.
What if you just spend them? Is it taxed as a commodity, or is the price going up simply "inflation"? The 10 bitcoins that last year could have bought me a tv can now buy me a car. I don't withdraw or exchange the btc, I use them to buy a car. Did their value still increase, and do I pay the tax on that as well?
I think on this forum there is a large amount of legitimate ignorance, but it is mixed in with plenty of arrogance. I just don't know the rules. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:59:40
With regard to mainstream media and the general population, most likely.

"whales" right now who have lots of Bitcoin and a grim view of the market? Seems that this can be a concern, not something that I see as a joke. Which seems to be the case of most of these posts.

As an early adopter, I'm not compulsively checking the price.  Checked a few days ago when it was hovering between 580 and 600, and it's doing the same thing now. And as much as I don't like that this (competitively) small jump is bringing back the gifs and memes, I always love me some Mr. Bean, and that makes me very satisfied.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:09:42
"Worth" or value is a measureable quality. How many units of a good can X buy? One dollar can buy one bigmac. One bitcoin can buy 600 bigmacs.
He starts off with the same value, the same worth of USD and BTC. In 4 years they will both have a different value.
Edit: Being worth something is literally what every economy in the world has been based on. Be it trading, seashells, rocks or currency. I don't seem to get what you're saying, because this does not seem like a concept that's hard to understand.

Why are you comparing Bitcoins to paypal? It makes it sound like it's A service.

You arbitrarily chose two points and choose to compare them. Sure, if you bought when it was worth pennies you're golden. But not everyone did.

That's a selfish approach. Not everyone can predict a bubble. Nothing regarding bitcoin is anyone's fault. But that kind of attitude isn't the way to get people involved. Which seems to be the main point of this post. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:12:16
It was a gamble back then and still is. I remembering reading about bitcoins in wired magazine a while ago, thinking it was a pretty sweet idea but not acting on it. BTC is young. It could take off, it could be a phase or just fail. No real way to tell. You were just being cautious with your money, which is usually a good thing.

The only way I used Craigslist in the past is to search for apartments. On sites like this, seems like there needs to be a lot of trust between you and the seller. Is there any sort of assurance, or legal protection that ensures that you get whatever you bought? Can you go through a basic step-by-step on how to purchase a car for example?

This is a forum with a dedicated goal. If there are posts that go against it, they are deleted. Whatever the mods don't seem fit, gets banned. You go post a picture of a cat in a forum dedicated to gardening, your post SHOULD be deleted. This may be censorahip in the dictionary meaning of the word, but it has meaning and intention behind it. It isn't to hold back your thoughts of excitement or depression. It's to not have to swim through shit to see a meaningful post.
The way people here are talking about this censorship makes it seem like the Gestapo and NSA joined forces to personally rape you.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:45:21
So you make ANOTHER post? Do you want an apology? Acknowledgment? Attention? Do you want the entire subreddit to stroke your cock while you sit on your throne made of your own ego?
This is the internet. There are circlejerks all over the place, this thread joining them. There is no discussion here, just " I was right and you need to know". 
People read what they want to read. Any news can be skewed to give a positive or negative side to it. You did nothing worthy of discussion. You gave an opinion, you gave your speculation, what else do you wany? Some people disagree with you, doesn't make anyone more right or more wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:46:25
It's not censorship, it's idiots taking away from the discussion. There is no point of posting countless memes or emotional personal updates. Whether the price is going up or down, this " censorship" can only help this subreddit get away from it's circlejerk mentality.

Warnings like this pop up here quite often, and I'm surprised every time. 
First of all, I already assume that people who are using BTC are above average intelligence. They SHOULD know or at least be familiar with basic programming, mathematics, technology. With this, I would assume that people who have BTC have a basic knowledge of statistics and probabilities.
The payouts on the gambling games do not make sense, and you logically cannot win, especially over many games. The odds are not in your favor, nor are they even equal. 
After typing this all out, I realize it is true for "real" casino games as well. Some skill in blackjack and poker can only keep you above the water for so long. 
TL;DR: that's gambling- don't do it unless you're able to afford to lose all that you're wagering.

This was an issue when the memes were positive as well. If anything, I saw more complaints then, rather than now.

I meant that Bitcoin would make ticketmaster not needed. Ticketmaster ia basically a monopoly when it comes to ticket sales. Bitcoin would let venues go around ticketmaster and cut out a very expensive middleman in the ticket buying process.
Just my opinion, obviously. But I can't explain why venues can't do without ticketmaster currently, so there is probably a big step I'm.missing.
Edit: so yes, Ticketmaster would hate bitcoin. You are right, and I agree with what you said. I think bitcoin would help venues directly and buyers.

Think you havr enough unnecessary assumptions. Very much sounds like you are talking down to them. Obviously I don't know the email that the litecoin advocate sent, but from seeing just your response, it seems very unprofessional.
Instead, why not simply say...
1. Sorry, not interested
2. I am happy with, amd believe in the future, of bitcoin.
No need to get super defensive and write out a long winded response. Were you asking reddit for advice, or just "showing off" your loyalty to Bitcoin?

If I were to work elsewhere, with a citizenship in that country. So the job is permanent and legitimate.

I mean about the dollar crashing. Many governments still use USD when trading internationally, most oil deals go through using the dollar, etc. It's such an important component of the global economy that if the dollar were to crash, I think there would be many more problems associated with it.
I always viewed crypto currencies as a parallel to fiat, not a replacement. At least not as soon as what you mentioned.
Any articles pertaining to what you said ? I'm just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:13:37
Isn't the issue at this moment the facility of purchasing BTC? I think that peiple's reliance on Mt. Gox comes from either the lack of knowledge on how else to buy BTC or just no other convenient methods.
Personally, I have used moneygrams to buy BTC. Took less than 20 minutes to drive to a CVS by me, make the exchange and get the bitcoins in my chainblock wallet. Never got involved in any of the delay or hacking or maintenance issues of any of these bigger companies.
I think educating people about alternative ways to buy bitcoins would prevent any sort of centralized authority from gaining too much power.

That's understandable. I was always one to just easily accept rules and not question authority. Parents, government, moderators on forums. Just always went along, followed the rules and didn't question things.
I can see where the dilemma is. Some people make it seems extremely tragic, as though their freedoms are being held at gunpoint. They may not be able to post joke memes of bitcoin going down, but I personally don't see it as a big deal. But I guess if these posts get the upvotes, people obviously care.

Too many people on this subreddit think that bitcoins is a stock, or some kid of investment. Glad to see that you're buying it for the intended use, and because of the belief in the technology.
But, bitcoin is still relatively young and not as wide in use. Do you have a way to buy groceries, clothes, every day things using BTC? May be helpful to have some USD on hand, maybe try a 50-50 split until more bitcoin supporters come out?
