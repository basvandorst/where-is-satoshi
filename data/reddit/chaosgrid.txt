They get their information from the longest chain on the network. If there is a hardfork, the longest chain is the correct chain and SPV clients will automatically follow that. Nothing has to be changed there.

Great post! I also have this feeling that it is actually him and he slowly wanted to be found. No human is perfect after all. But we can create alter egos that appear perfect. Satoshi most definitely was such a construct.
I guess we will find out very soon. I don't think Craig will just go completely silent considering his [tweets]( in the last weeks.

I might actually do that but now there is a problem. In the issue you opened, you already conclude the following: "In short, developers (and business plan writers) should not assume future transactions will be as easy or as cheap to confirm as current transactions."
This implies that the blog size increase will not happen. Together with this blog post, it seems like bitcoin.org is now a no-blocksize-increase-bitcoin website and other (even popular) opinions are discouraged "for the good of bitcoin".

Sorry but what the hell?
If anything, bitcoin.org should be a place where users get educated. Instead of such a blog post there should be a prominent page about bitcoins scalability issues because the scalability issues are **non-contentius**! All developers agree that something must be done. There should be a dedicated page for presenting all the options to solve the scalability issue (i.e. waiting for systems working on top of the protocol, the various block size increase ideas and so on).
On such a page, there could also be a guide for users, merchants, miners and node runners on what to do if they want to support a certain way forward (i.e. do nothing, download a different version of bitcoin core or bitcoin XT or whatever, etc..). What this does is increase transparency. Such a page could also include an overview of the current network status and who is running what.
The way you have chosen effectively **removes** transparency and the openess of the bitcoin protocol. It drives the current blog size increase proponents (which there are A LOT of) to go away from bitcoin.org to 3rd party sites (which might become the future true bitcoin websites) to get information from. You say you dont want to harm bitcoin, but what this does is in my view the absolute opposite.

Wow, thanks! I'm really hyped now. A bitcoin eco-system simulator running on a supercomputer is really helpful, especially in the scaling debate!

Let's say sometime after January 2016, with the halving coming up and the ETF maybe being established, there is major interest in Bitcoin. However, BitcoinXT and the bigger blocks patch has not been widely deployed (less than 75% of blocks are XT).
Assume we consistently hit the maximum cap: a growing backlog of transactions means that fees rise to the point where user growth will be limited directly proportional to the block size and its supported number of transactions. 
Now, with BitcoinXT around, in this event we can simply switch the majority of the network to BitcoinXT and within 2 weeks, the first big block will be able to be mined. Contrast this to the alternative, where the mighty Bitcoin Core developers need to reach a consensus **quickly** as regards blocksize. I will guarantee that at least one or two developers will still be against a blocksize increase, which by definition will make that a *contentious* hard fork and nothing will be accomplished.
What I'm saying is that it might not actually be important to run BitcoinXT right now. But having BitcoinXT around as an option to switch to bigger blocks within two weeks after Jan. 2016 will be **extremely** valuable!

It was more an idea to get rid of old-spam-transactions actually. I.e. you pay at a 0-conf accepting vendor and suddenly some miner mines  old spam-transactions which includes a double spend that is actually not really visible in the network anymore because a number of nodes/miners have restarted and flushed their mempools (this might happen if the network is consistently saturated and there will be transactions that will never be mined even though they are not exactly spam)..
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:08:30
It seems like this needs to be solved on the merchant and wallet level: Implement algorithms that estimate the chance of inclusion into the next blocks and if that chance is too low (i.e. prohibited by anti-spam measures) display a warning to the user receiving such a tx to wait for confirmation. As for merchants, it is more complicated because how long should the merchant wait?
I feel like this actually calls for timeout values for transactions. I.e. if a transaction is not mined within 1 hour (6 blocks), it stops getting relayed, gets deleted out of the mempool and blocks containing tx which are too old are invalid (is this even possible?).
Otherwise, 0-conf might soon be dead? Would love some comments from devs on this.

It will also allow private investors to buy on regular stock trading accounts, as you can see here:

So if the relay network is so great, why has it not been implemented directly in Bitcoin Core yet? 
@_date: 2016-02-18 11:37:48
This is not entirely correct. The recent versions of bitcoin core, classic and XT all employ a mempool transaction expiration period of 72 hours. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:43:48


This statement does not make sense. Just because I want to save bandwidth does not mean I want to stop relaying transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:32:32


Or the traffic shaping functionality in XT ;)


But which problem do we have then? We need bigger blocks soon (better: today). Bigger blocks are slow to propagate (for normal nodes at least). A better, faster and more efficient way to propagate blocks (for all nodes) seems like a good solution to that problem.

I actually posted it with XT but it did not appear (auto-censored maybe?).. lets see if this will appear.
/edited the post, maybe it was just reddit acting up.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:26:28
Appear as in the whole post was not visible when I logged out. I'm getting paranoid around here :\
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:13:20
I think these attacks are an indirect result of the language used by the anti-XT folks, deeming it a hostile fork and dangerous to bitcoin. While there is FUD spread on both sides, the action of censoring XT posts on the major bitcoin sites is unparalleled and makes me think that certain people actually like having 10% of the network getting DDOSed to "save" bitcoin.
A lot of people often blame Mike &amp; Gavin for dividing the community, but if anybody is to blame I think we know where to actually look.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:15:28
Nobody is arguing for that. Not every version change requires a hard fork (or soft fork).
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:47:48
This is a really odd scenario. It assumes a crashing and corrupting bug that occurs when the first hard-forking block is mined and relayed. I think this is extremely unlikely since most changes like this are extensively tested. But anyways, it would still arguably be cleaner with hard forks since you can just roll back to the older version. Of course many local copies of the blockchains may be corrupted, but you assume an ideal world where everybody is updated instantly and has no backups. Quite a peculiar scenario.
Btw. this is also a good reason to have many bitcoin protocol implementations so that your scenario is not as tragic and not only one bitcoin full node client software exists.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:07:35
Also check out the proposal for implementing a switch that allows soft forking behaviour for old nodes:

If this is the next bubble and the network cannot handle the increased load at some point, it will be oh so relevant.
