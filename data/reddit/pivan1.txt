Do you have any references of this claim? Not being confrontational, just curious about it. It's an interesting situation if so.

You've already established yourself as a non-average person [here]( As you said you live in a "bubble". Lots of people don't.
I can see where you're coming from though. An average person in a first world/developed country with a reasonably stable and functioning economy and access to inexpensive (read: subsidized) financial services who has no political/idealogical passions and doesn't want to gamble on speculative investing or aren't a merchant  then they may not care. And may not need to care. Maybe some day some merchants and vendors will be Bitcoin-only and then there *might* be some caring, but who knows. We'll see.
But if *any* of the above conditions don't describe you then you probably ought to care. The tiny sliver of people who meet all of those criteria I would wager is small. But it does, apparently, include you. The only other reason would be to just generally learn how it works and how to use: educate yourself by getting a little bit and making a purchase, so you have that skillset in your comfy bubble. :)

Fair point. I agree $2 off for a $100 item isn't much and likely is not going to matter to most. But when I look at how much money I run through my credit and debit cards (for which I do not qualify for points/cashback systems) and I apply 2% as a reduction over, say, a year, that starts getting to a nice little chunk of change. Perhaps I'm too much of the "pen saved penny earned" mentality than most.


That's great. I, too, have had generally positive experiences with charge backs and banks being understanding of theft. On the other hand I've been over-charged by companies I already have relationships with on a regular basis. Comcast overcharging for their service? Local utility error in their service? The fact that they can withdraw *whatever they want* means at a minimum a hassle and a maximum serious financial strife for a short time.
But to be clear a standard transaction type is irreversible. As I mentioned third-party "escrow" services mitigate this. M-of-N transactions mitigate this. So it would be *your choice* to use irreversible transactions. If you don't want to, you don't have to. In some cases you might not have a choice depending on the vendor, but then market forces will give your business to another vendor. You do realize that almost all Bitcoin "market" (ebay) type websites have escrow services built-in, right? In other words this is already has a solution. I'm sure you'll just want to call one number and don't want to deal with every little escrow service. Awesome, to each their own. Diversity is cool. :)
Do realize, though, the irreversibility nature of Bitcoin works both ways. Under reasonable circumstances nobody can take your bitcoin. That's appealing. It rather bugs me that every vendor I use my credit or debit cards at has *carte blanche* to take whatever money they want from me. Without my permission or consent they have that technical ability. Sure I could sue them, or get my credit card company to haggle them but, I dunno, I want to try *new* financial systems. How can make that better or improve? Won't know if we try! :)


Yes, the EMV standards for chip and NFC-based transactions will be great for working in the existing credit card/banking systems. It's about time the US catches to other leaders in this area. I applaud the EMV consortium for requiring new electronic payment terminal support (thus enabling Apple Pay to "dominate"). Consumers stand to be better protected and have easier more flexible payment. Naturally as a Bitcoin fan it's nice to see non-Bitcoin folks get some of the benefits that Bitcoin has. :)


As I explained above I'm not sure an average consumer in a stable and functioning financial system (i.e. a first world environment) will have much need for Bitcoin. So for my part, I'm not the cheerleader to bring Bitcoin to the first world users.
I am going to go out on a limb and say it sounds like you're a fairly smart, diligent consumer. You probably had the wherewithal to search online for the best price for that camera that you already did research on. Then you used your somewhat exclusive credit card (which, likely, you researched on and specifically chose it on your grounds). Maybe you used that particular card because it was an unknown situation and they have the best consumer protection of your available credit cards. Obviously all that was guess work, but I mention it merely to say that's a *lot* of planning and thinking.
I want to be more "free" with my money, if that makes sense. I want to be able to think less about when I spend money - especially donating it. I want to buy stuff from less-than-trustworthy places (read: street markets, international vendors, etc.) without giving them the ability to rip me off.
And, yes, I am one of those people who care about independence from the existing financial systems *even if it means* allowing drug users and terrorists to use and move money. Just like I think tor and Freenet are important parts of this world despite anarchist, terrorist, and worse information floating about on it. While I don't approve of those things our existing system is *too far* in the wrong direction. 
And now for my hippy-dippy rant. :) For better or worse money is the very lifeblood of the world. Unless you're wealthy most people are, more or less, governed by money. While Bitcoin doesn't change that the nature of it's use and control by other people is severely limited and it's accessibility is high. Anybody or anything can own Bitcoin, no rules at all. It's something I deeply feel every person has a *right* (yes, right, as in should be entitled) to have and use, including digital and/or "banking"-like services. Bitcoin is the only thing I see that has that promise in the world right now.
Yes in the US we're doing quite fine and as long as you're not on the blacklist and have your papers you can get a bank account. But I think *that* is too high a bar for people to have to go through to move and use money.
So: "average consumer"? Meh, I could sorta care less. As a *potential* tool to bring financial freedom to many? That's where it's at.
Cheers! :)

For anybody who's curious about the backdoor nature on iPhones: ask yourself this: why, when they have the technical ability to assure no software *other* than Apple software can go on the phone (see security white paper) then why does Apple "let" jailbreaking to happen on their phones?
It appears they have firmware level capability to ensure only Apple-signed software can run on the phone, but clearly aren't exercising that ability. I'd like to know why. Yes some of it comes to end-user support in case of bad software being flashed to the phone (recovery modes) but that isn't a good enough answer for me.

This is fundamentally how Bitcoin works, though. If you don't have Bitcoin you can't spend it. There is no "credit" in the Bitcoin world.
Now if you're saying Coinbase should "float" the risk of NSF from it's customer's so that these things can be attempted then that opens up Coinbase to significant risk *because* the way Bitcoin works. E.g. if Coinbase spends more Bitcoins on your behalf than you have credited to your account those Bitcoin are *gone*. Forever. In the Paypal situation they have charge-backs and the banking system to reverse changes by.
However if Coinbase or anybody else *could* figure out a way to do that, that'd be a cool feature.


Coinbase offers an "instant buy" option where Bitcoin is immediately deposited into your account.


They do have online chat help. They do have email support, too. They have a phone number (which, admittedly, isn't answered for support calls). I've personally held both email and chat conversations with Coinbase.

Pointless? Hardly. It ensures that, despite capitol being thrown at the mining process, the actual mining of blocks remains relatively fair.
Now, whether that's *worth it* to any given person is up for discussion, but I don't think it could be called pointless.

@_date: 2014-09-28 20:50:04
You bring up excellent and valid points. So, not really arguing here but I wanted to at least make an attempt at addressing them, mostly for own ability to explain things. :)


While true (most exchanges or "brokers" (Coinbase/Circle) charge a fee for acquiring bitcoin) this, theoretically, is offset by lower prices of goods/services. Those lower prices are enabled by the nature of lower transaction fees incurred by the merchant by the existing systems.


Yep, a very real risk. If you mean "fraud protection" as in a bank that can bail-out fraud that's true, the "be your own bank" mantra runs counter to that. But consider the situation where "brokers" are acting as banks now, like Coinbase. Since they're the "holder" of your coins they can have systems in place to mitigate and/or be liable for loss of coins. You can argue against and say "welp, Mt. Gox did a great job of that" and you'd be right.
If you're talking merchant fraud Bitcoin shines here, which is why I think you mentioned theft. Since Bitcoin is, credit-based and not debit-based transaction fraud is significantly reduced. And of course escrow services have yet to come into their own, but when they do you now have a *choice* of potential fraud protection, rather than having to deal just with your bank - an all-or-nothing model.


No doubt the legal status of Bitcoin in areas can be problematic. Only thing I can say is that Bitcoin is new and it seems more and more favorable to governments everyday as they get warmed up to the fact that, no, it's not a threat. Also it's fairly easy to exchange out of Bitcoin back into an "accepted" currency if need be.


Yep, a currency that's traded like a commodity with low liquidity and a low market cap is a pretty big problem. I don't have a good answer for this. It's just a fact of life.


The smartphone thing is changing all the time. XAPO, Trezors, SMS systems, Smart cards, etc. On the other hand everything and everyone is moving toward smartphone transactions. Plain plastic magstripe cards have been on their way out for more than a decade. Plus the economies of scale are making smartphones cheaper every day.


This is true, but not necessarily so. There could be a Bitcoin off-blockchain system that conducts it's business at low enough cost so as to enable rewards. That's all pie-in-the-sky, though. 
However as I explained above the lower transaction fees should theoretically enable lower prices on products, perhaps anceling out cashback or rewards.


Not only does Bitcoin not offer this, it's antithetical to the nature of how Bitcoin itself works (i.e. not having reserve banking properties). That's not to say there couldn't be companies that issue loans backed by Bitcoin (and if you count investment as a form of "loan" then this is already happening plenty).


See previous. Bitcoin is like cash or like a commodity. US dollars or stocks have this same "problem." A bit apples and oranges.
I don't think Bitcoin replaces loans or credit. Those are important financial tools. So loan companies and credit cards can still exist with Bitcoin. Imagine paying your mortgage or credit card bill with Bitcoin.
Now this whole response was a rebuttal to your points and doesn't really mention all the pluses of Bitcoins, though they were mentioned in some of the points. Also there's the whole idealistic aspect of people who dislike the notion of banks of reserve lending and government fiat. I happen to believe that for people living in first world countries (i.e. places that have a well established and stable financial system) they may very well not be good incentive to use Bitcoin as an alternative to existing systems. And that's okay. Other places will have an incentives and for those inclined Bitcoin will keep growing.
The future is bright, I say. :)

Sure, I agree with everything you've said except your conclusion. I maintain that it is still technically possible for Apple to have an Apple-only execution environment from the boot environment on up. You gave the example of Safari and Javascript, while that may be true that's a conscious choice Apple's made to allow JIT (and even so I believe a JIT could also be secured to very reasonable degrees). But they've elected not to do this. I'll even argue that firmware/bootloader security, authenticated booting, and protected OSes are way old hat, too. So it's not like this is cutting edge stuff. It *is* possible to have an OS that is jailbreak-free. Apple has chosen not to have such an OS, however, for better or worse. I guess that was my point. Cheers! :)

In all fairness, though, radio offered a better user experience at the time for the use case mentioned. In 1995 we're talking some crappy 20 Kbps Real Audio stream (i.e. near to telephone quality) over dial-up. You had to be visionary to see that these things would be better. But it's not about the relative quality. It's about the belief of what could be.
I mean we look and laugh now but who but the most entrenched would have seen that you can *watch* to a live baseball game while walking down the street in crystal clarity high-def  on a device the size of a mobile phone that is more powerful than a full-size desktop computer was back in 1995.
So, I don't hold it against the audience or Letterman for cracking the jokes and laughing. They simply lacked vision (and really, it was a joke). Think about 14 years from now when Bitcoin is 20 years old. How will finance and banking work *then?*

This generally doesn't happen for rich folks, especially investor types. Generally they don't hold cash. It's all tied up in investments. Return-generating investments. So they get richer.
Only those folks who can't afford to invest or who are not allowed to invest in high-return investments suffer at the hands of inflation. Generally speaking, of course.

I think reject is the wrong word. It's code, it has no opinions about notions. It just doesn't implement centralization. It's not required. Perhaps a better word might be obsolete. Bitcoin obsoletes centralization.

That is a possibility. I'm not sure I'd agree with your "all but guaranteed", though. It's adoption would have to be unbelievably huge. *And* people, corporations, organizations, and governments would have to stop using fiat currencies for them to "fail."
Those are almost impossible barriers, given the current socio-political environment. Again while totally possible, just doesn't seem particuarly probable.

This doesn't change the history of anything. That merely changes files in a source code repository. The history of what actually happened still happened. Nobody can "change" history. If there's something legally culpable that they did, they'd still be on the hook regardless of what some text files happen to now say. But I don't think they did anything wrong.


This isn't possible. Not unless they specifically signed away their copyright status. At the moment of creation the code is owned by the copyright owner. Then, while having copyright, they choose to license under any given FOSS license. But *they still have the original copyright* to all their code and previous code. They can relicense any of that code any time they please. This is how open source works.
Now that doesn't mean they've rescinded the licenses they previously granted. E.g. everyone who obtained the software under that license still has that license applied (unless the parties involved breached the license). So it's of marginal utility to re-license past code (as the licenses are still valid and out in the world) but it's entirely legally doable as the copyright owner can kinda do whatever they want with their creation.
As well I'm not downplaying the social faux pas they did by changing git history. That's a no no and *gives the impression* of foul play. Open source folks are generally an idealistic bunch and Bitcoin enthusiasts even more so. Changing licenses in a reactionary fashion was the wrong thing to do and it was right for folks to get ruffled about it.
I'm just saying that strictly legally speaking it doesn't appear any wrong was done here.
