What's the question?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:09:35
Cool, well thanks for that TIL.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:14:38
Ah ok, I didn't realize that. Isn't that a problem? shouldn't empty block be uneconomical?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:04:43
Ah ok, and that's something all miners do, not just the ASICBoost people?
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:35:31
What are those blocks with 0 size? Is someone still mining empty blocks? I thought they'd fixed that. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:43:50
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:26:59
With that solved is it still possible to mine empty blocks? 
@_date: 2019-07-21 04:45:08
Move the coins to wrapped-bitcoin on Ethereum and use a smart contract.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:16:56
Maybe not but you could do much more interesting things just as store them somewhere where they could be collecting interest.
Also I'd imagine there's more tools to audit and verify the quality and correctness of eth contracts over bitcoin's.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:04:22
They as in the core devs. I thought someone had built a special ASIC optimized for empty blocks and recently there was a change that disabled that. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:16:44
It'd be pretty easy for the Chinese to just start shooting those satellites down.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:49:05
They do that on purpose to collect the barf for the McRibs.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:51:10
I wonder how many of those were inside jobs.

I guess I'm out of the loop but why does he deserve this? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:48:07


Why would that make it sound money?


When ethreum forked the exact same thing happened. 
So if I'm understanding you the only advantage of bitcoin over ethereum is the cap? If ethereum had a cap then it would be the same as bitcoin, is that right?
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:01:30
I guess maybe one day we'll find out. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:03:19


You know that Ethereum has already forked and the people writing code for the fork have nothing to do with the Ethereum Foundation. How is Ethereum centralised when at any time everyone can just choose to go with a forked version that the Ethereum Foundation has no special power over? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:45:32


What does it matter what it was meant to be? If I can settle a debt with bitcoin then I can also settle it with ethereum. Technically there's no difference, as long as the both parties are accepting of both. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:27:16
I wonder if this has something to do with why the Twins ETF was rejected?
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:46:25
Sure theoretically that could work and maybe will someday. At the moment you can only pay for gas with ETH. Unless there is some layer in between that is converting the ETH for you. 
How is Bitcoin sound money and Ethereum isn't? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:21:36
The bitcoin cap could be changed at any time. All it would take is a fork, BCH proves that any idiot can fork bitcoin and enough people to switch to the forked version.
Under your definition of sound money is USD sound money?
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:42:23
What's the difference though? They're both just a number tied to a private key on a blockchain. As far as I can tell the only difference is you can power an Ethereum smart contract with ETH but not with bitcoin. Any point of sale device that supports bitcoin is trivially able to support ETH. I can't think of any usecase for bitcoin that you can't also do with ETH, can you?
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:19:28
How is waiting for 95% support before making a change considered can centralised?
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:30:53
Before the Core devs will activate a change they'd like to make they're waiting for 95% approval from the network. How do you go from there to "core is ebun more centralised!" is what I don't get.

They don't cite their sources.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:26:23
lol what?
@_date: 2019-06-14 10:03:24
I just don't get the analogy to gaming consoles. AFAIK there wasn't a time where the gaming space only discussed Xbox vs PlayStation and that caused Nintendo and PC gaming to die.
Why would a btc vs libra discussion impact alt coins necessarily? Especially utility coins or ones that offer features beyond just payment.
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:26:31
There's definitely been an uptick in these Nazi comics being posted here.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:32:35
I don't think he was criticising that you get your information from reading. Rather that you seem to know so little about your sources that you can't even remember where you read that information. 
It implies that you're someone who just believes what you read without doing your due diligence with regards to checking your sources. 
Obviously that may not be the case but it's a bad sign.
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:07:42
I totally agree. In fact most billionaires are likely hundreds of years old at this point. It's frankly prusperous that he could die at all, let alone in India. I've heard stories of middle managers that have escaped death three or four times already over there.
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:45:12
How does your analogy fit to your conclusion? Are you implying that Nintendo and PC gaming died?
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:07:10
No, try reading my response again.
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:50:29
We're on the same side!
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:43:34
No that's wrong.

@_date: 2019-02-06 19:00:50
Are you the guy who just died in India?
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:49:09
Yeah personally I've never heard of anyone dying in India. Let alone someone with access to a bunch of cash. Nothing about this "story" ""adds"" """up"""""

I was trying to answer this question:


@_date: 2019-06-25 09:35:13
Unless bitcoin.com is charging a $11k tx fee.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:08:15
Yeah I'd really like to see the original report as well. It's frustrating it doesn't seem to be shared publicly anywhere. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:20:08
I was just trying to explain what the other guy was saying. Obviously I've failed to do that. 
It's really not that complicated though. I'm sure if it's important to you, you can figure it out on your own.
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:52:56
I really don't see what's so confusing. No I wasn't talking about Beanie babies. 
Can you really not figure out on your own what I was trying to say? Is it really worth our time for me to try to explain it to you?
I get the feeling you really don't care what I was saying you just want to get mad about Beanie babies.
@_date: 2019-12-20 15:52:04
Why would they have to shut down because of that?
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:28:35
Wow that seems surprisingly plausible.
@_date: 2019-12-20 23:12:55
Why not just stay running for the users willing to answer those questions?
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:01:05
Or are we just saying the same thing?
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:34:01
Really? I mean it could be Szabo I guess but you'd think of it was him he would've done something to prove that it's not CW by now.
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:47:23
I don't think it's that hard to figure out
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:35:24
It most likely mentions a source that told them about the bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2019-04-15 09:16:46
Isn't it pretty obvious it was Hal Finney? Is that not just generally accepted at this point?
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:49:31
What's meaningless about hundreds if not thousands of people being scammed out of their money? I'm also an old fart religiously read 2600 and used to partake. My impression of Satoshi isn't someone who would be ok with watching that happen in their name.
It seems much more likely they're just dead.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:31:19
All it would take is a single Bitcoin transaction to protect all those people. I can't claim to have directly spoken with Satoshi but I can't imagine them being that much of a psychopath.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:22:59
Sure, you can romanticize it however you like but it's kinda strange that actual Satoshi hasn't commented or even touched any of his Bitcoin since Hal Finney died. 
Especially considering all the drama over the last three years and people claiming to represent "Satoshi's vision" you'd think if they were around they'd move some genisis coins from one wallet to another along with a brief message clarifying their vision.
It's weird that someone who clearly cared so much back then suddenly stop giving a shit after Finney died. 
I mean, I'm not a smart person but I'm not *that* dumb either.
@_date: 2019-04-17 05:46:11


It's good to acknowledge we still haven't confirmed this even is the real Craig Wright.

@_date: 2019-01-24 14:25:39
Really? That's nuts, is that meant to come with a new fork? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:51:36
Sure it's good for bitcoin and it's an appealing advert. I just don't understand how you could describe it as "clear". For me it's actually the exact opposite of clear. But maybe that's just because it's not targeted to me. Apparently "DMM" is something most Japanese would instantly recognize. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:31:37


That doesn't sound like the desired response to a "clear" advert. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:06:14
Wouldn't a single Satoshi be a "whole coin"?
@_date: 2018-11-10 10:08:18
What's the gold ETF market like?
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:22:57
Sure, but it's not an advert for bitcoin. It's an advert that DMM now supports bitcoin. 
What you're saying is equivalent to saying the WOMAN is pretty clear for me, what a great advert for women. Or maybe eyeliner? Is it also a really clear advert for eyeliner? 
The point of the advert is for people to use DMM not bitcoin. If this advert motivates to to download some other wallet software and just buy bitcoin on an exchange it's failed in it's purpose of getting you to use DMM. Due to lack of clarity. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:33:46
Nice, that's way better.
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:39:58
That's probably why I said: 


@_date: 2019-01-11 07:38:07
How is it clear? I have no idea what it's advertising other than vaguely Bitcoin. I don't know what DMM is supposed to mean.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:51:53
Ah ok, thanks TIL.

Marketcap is the total value of all bitcoins. Trade volume is just how much was traded. If many trades brings the price down that's reflected for all coins, even though &lt;1% of coins were actually being traded.

Yeah that seems sustainable. $10k for the power consumption of Denmark for free, forever. That seems like something that actually exists not just irrational hyperbole.

That's not all it is though is it? Any business of a certain size will be making regular deposits through a bank and that banks statements will used when filing taxes. 
What happens when that no longer needs to happen? If a business can create a new address for each incoming transaction how can a government ever be able to independently confirm how much income that business has made?
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:57:16


Yeah, you sound like you know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:06:54
Assuming Bitcoin becomes the new global currency. How are taxes collected? How do governments verify how much taxes business or individuals owe?
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:04:22
It sounded to me like he thinks a bribe is something that just magically happens in corrupt countries and somehow doesn't involve cash.

Yeah I think people here are missing what he meant by "the people behind it". I think he was referring to who's working to maintain a stable value so it can be used for national and international business efficiently.
