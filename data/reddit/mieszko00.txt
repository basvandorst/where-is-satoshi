This is a different problem, not the kind of stuff you need to give a heads up before making it public.

Stop using wallets like this, if there is a malicious extension on your browser you would lose your money.

What a crappy job at controlling the interview. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:33:54
No, only the ones who go about 90% of the time defending that company. Specially when they get an abnormal amount of upvotes for a comment that is buried. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:18:30
This is phishing!!!

C'om BitGo ppl, you claim to be "the security experts", at least buy some extra domains.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:36:21
Anti-competitive, why at this point. Such a big market, i thought you guys were bigger than that.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:26:27
I'm tired of these clowns, Coinbase is a bank, they are manipulating votes and misleading people about Bitcoin. We should expose them for who they are in every post.
