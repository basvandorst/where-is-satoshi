I bought a 60 GH/s BFL miner for 65 BTC last year :'(
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:36:10
I tried to switch one of my miner to my own p2pool node. It works fine but cgminer reported 450 GH/s instead of 560, don't know why... I switched back to slush pool and the rate was back to 560.

The computer market is deflationary, wait a bit and you can have a computer with more power and with a lower price than today. So why people are buying computers?
The current system force people to consume (and produce on the other hand) like crazy, everything is done to enslave each one of us : endless debt, advertisements everywhere, currency inflation, etc...
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:04:35
I'm running a full node but it costs me about 15€ per month and I'm limited to 500 GiB of data upload per month which is not enough. I'm doing this because I believe in bitcoin and I want to support it.

The Lamassu machine is far simpler and better : 
I don't care about selling bitcoins, all I want is to easily buy some bitcoins.

Lamassu's machines are far better :

And if the mining costs go up then the price will slightly go down. This prevents the price to go too high.
@_date: 2016-11-11 18:26:50
I also tried and I got some troubles to scan my QR code on my smartphone, the instructions wasn't clear, it took me some time to find the correct distance and position. Why there is no preview of the camera with a little cross target on the screen ?
I buy for 500 CHF and the fees was pretty high: 30 CHF.
Despite of that it worked fine ;)
@_date: 2018-06-12 08:42:56
The mining cost (depending of the bitcoin value and the bitcoin supply rate) prevents bitcoin to get as high as it should be. I predict it will never go above the dickline again.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:55:21
You are correct, it's a sort of feedback loop. But it costs a lot and someone has to pay the price.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:00:15
The issue is that the cost of the network in mining is very high (something like 4 M$ per day right now). It's strongly correlated to the price of Bitcoin. At a certain point the new amount of dollars injected each day in bitcoin will not be enough to cover this 4 M$ and the price will stabilize.
I predict Bitcoin will never reach $10'000.

According [Wikipedia]( it is not. I'm living in Switzerland and I never saw that symbol before.

I think, we can't say that the current inflationary system doesn't work, it just forces people to work and it creates some inequalities. The current issue is that people are trapped in a production-consumption mindset, it will be very hard to change that.

With an ATI HD 6990 you may get something like 3-4$ per day

Yep, I paid with $ and made a little profit... but then I did the mistake to buy a Single for 65 BTC which I didn't receive yet...
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:06:05
I already sent them 5 BTC ... now nearly 1000$

I didn't reflash mine. And it seems we get the same profit.

Does the balance shouldn't be 3.9999?

What will prevent the price of bitcoin to indefinitely go up (rally) then abruptly go down (crash)? It seems there will always be a ton of speculators playing with their new toy.
@_date: 2013-02-28 14:14:50
I sent an email too about the missing confirmation on a recent pre-order. Furthermore there is no way anymore to login to the customer account to see my pre-order: 
It's a bit suspicious.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:27:28
Sure it is and it will always be. If mining becomes less profitable some miners will stop to mine, so it will tend to become a bit more profitable for the other miners.
