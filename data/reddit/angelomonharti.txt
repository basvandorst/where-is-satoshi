The same amount of bitcoin is mined every day. Why don't you take 5 minutes to learn about bitcoin before you bother everyone on reddit?

Judging by china absolutley raping the price of BTC I think its obvious that bitcoin is still at the mercy of government regulation, as decentralized and untouchable people like to think it is. Put me down for banking overlords.

7% is most definitely not the inflation rate if thats what youre implying

If 95% of the hash power goes one way and you go the other... you are the fork

The definition of investment is purchasing an asset with hopes that it appreciates in the future. BTC is an asset. Gold is an asset. Stocks are an asset.

Looks like the floor happened a few hours ago. The drop was from panic selling based in the news of china closing exchanges, coindesk is estimating a return to $3700 as people massively oversold. You have to be lightning quick and confident or you will never buy in at the right time.

The definition of speculation is forming a theory without firm evidence

You could say this after every change in price. I will say though that panic selling never goes over well. Once the panic subsides there is always a rebound

It all makes sense to me now

$3330 is pretty high by todays standards lol

How is that any different from any other bank? If everyone tried to withdraw their savings in cash, the global economy would collapse. Exchanges probably can't and won't accommodate a mass exchange of USDT to USD but thats the way it has always been with traditional currencies.
