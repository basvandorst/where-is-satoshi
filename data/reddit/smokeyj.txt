Forget that OP is an idiot. Do you ero79 (or anyone upvoting you) honestly think someone financing drugs and terrorism would write it down on the comment section on their coinbase account as "drugs and terrorism"? I want to know if I'm dealing with actual retards here. 
I can appreciate an infatuation with stellar regulatory compliance technology or something along those lines. But let's not pretend the security theater that is "our post 9/11 world" is actually making anyone safer. Because then you actually are a retard. 
We should not applaud self censorship. It is not Coinbases job to fight the war on drugs and terror. Today Coinbase is analyzing text inputs, tomorrow they'll be scanning your social media accounts.

It's not contradictory to say my point wasn't to ding coinbase while also dinging coinbase. The *point* wasn't to ding coinbase which is why it was the last paragraph, which I aimed to use a rhetorical device to support my opening statements. Even though I named coinbase, it was just an example for what *all* service providers will have to comply with. 


I can see why you'd think I'm suggesting Coinbase shouldn't comply with the law, but I was trying to say those laws shouldn't exist in the first place. I could have said "It is not Coinbase's job *in society* to fight drugs and terrorism". 
If I was suggesting the former, I wouldn't have made this statement:


So I stand by my statements. I have coins on coinbase. I think they provide a good service. That doesn't mean I'll cheer them for protecting my safety. Whether you can grasp that will remain a mystery.

I realize that. I'm saying putting money in your shoe can serve a purpose. Specifically, it serves a large purpose in an environment that doesn't have interest rates established by fiat. In that scenario the interest rate on currency is determined by the market -- and "hoarding" (deferment of consumption) helps signal what the rate should be.
Consider an environment where interest rates are established by fiat. Long term planning can become difficult because interest rates are subject to change at a whim. If interest rates are kept too low, the economy is signaled to grow artificially -- even if the underlying assets and resources aren't in alignment. If interest rates are too high, resources will be underutilized. I think finding an appropriate signal for interest will rely on some sort of market signal, and that's a good thing for avoiding economic bubbles.

Besides the bitcoin economy.. The one in which you snubbed its participants for savings in a shoe box.. 
Your view on economics is severely distorted if you think an inflationary currency is "socially responsible" because it forces people to invest their money. 
That's the problem. All the market participants realize the other participants *have to* invest their money, and market players are forced to speculate (invest) on anticipated market movement rather than underlying fundamentals.

I think bitcoin the network can be sustained without bitcoin the currency. If a colored coin implementation became the primary use case, miner fees could be paid in colored assets. If I'm trying to send a coin representing a barrel of oil, I make the fee 1 gallon of oil - which the miner could look up the exchange rate and decide whether to include the tx. Which brings up some interesting thought experiments. What if we could price services in any asset, and accept payment denominated in any asset. 
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin the currency is more promising than any fiat system in existence. I just wonder if the next step is phasing out "currency" and simply pricing in terms of assets, or even something like units of energy..

Bitcoin is a digital *currency*. Have you ever heard of a currency that doesn't allow you to purchase a cup of coffee? How does that sound reasonable to anyone. Maybe we should call bitcoin a digital 401k or something along those lines. 
For bitcoin to function as gold it has to have value. That value comes from the usefulness of bitcoin as a currency. You can't have one without the other. You can't just say "bitcoin is past the currency phase and is now an investment vehicle that isn't used for daily transactions". That's a complete bait and switch from the original vision people bought in to. 
Bitcoin is being mined on custom fabricated circuitry designed to perform cryptographic operations sourced from unreliable manufacturers, and we're worried about disk space? The real reason a whole other bitcoin community exists is because discussion on the topic wasn't allowed. Any discussion of modifying the variable MAX_BLOCK_SIZE was considered an "alt coin" and forbidden. It makes a reasonable person wonder why censorship was the solution.

Yet gold is still held by central banks. You can still carry a gold bar worth more than your net worth. From a global perspective a gold coin is highly fungible. That's the one and only reason it has its price. 
I'm not saying the price is justified. I'm long on crypto. But you can't argue gold is valuated as a jewelry or electronics component. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:30:01
I'm just being a butthole. These technologies don't exist. 
People are mad because the temporary scaling solutions were rejected in favor of purism and "off-chain" transactions. Well, those solutions don't exist and now people are on a witch hunt against "spam transactions" saying "hurrr you're not using the bitcoin correctly" because they're primitive neanderthals who couldn't chuck a spear to hit a wooly mammoth. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:19
The things is.. bitcoin has gone through a number of "upgrades", and without them we wouldn't be using it. 
BTC is in a tough spot. What are the chances that it has the best features and configured parameters the first time around? What are the chances that upgrades will be available but won't be activated because of consensus difficulty? 
No one has really solved this problem. Bitcoin is going to become solidified the way it is, for better or worse. A decentralized upgrade protocol is the way forward but that doesn't exist. 
But I'd say something is different about our inability to upgrade this time. Now it's due to a financial conflict of interest between the company that writes the bitcoin code and the people who use it. And it's been a less than honest debate to say the least. They've resorted to censoring the conversation and kicking out people who disagree. It's like the new boss became the old boss..

I remember years ago they used to link to Austrian Economics on the side bar. I wonder if they removed it so they can peddle this "bitcoin asset" bullshit. Hint: it's not economically sound. 
How far away do you think LN is? I personally think Core will be forced to increase the blocksize when everyone realizes how far away (and non existent) LN really is. Core will be forced to backpeddle on every objection they've given to larger blocks and they'll implement it because BCH will be taking their lunch. And of course, there will be no more centralization when the magic number is doubled or trippled. Just my prediction..

You can't have the asset without underlying utility. Gold is an asset because it has utility as a transactional medium. Bitcoin without the utility of a currency/ledger is an arbitrary token. 
We're operating in a completely free market. If you really think an inferior ledger is going to with the *blockchain* space then you don't understand the fundamentals.

Yes I can read a commit log. Yes Blockstream is a malicious entity. They hold the power to control the discussion around bitcoin and use it to manufacture a false consensus (or lack thereof). 


Yes. If you hold this view *today* it's because of the "social engagement" efforts of blockstream. You were convinced, by someone who was convinced, by someone who has an interest in blockstream.

The price reflects future expectations. A bad earnings call can cause a sell off. Investors are on the phone asking where's LN and saying "two weeks" isn't good enough. 
If you're a CEO and choose long term scaling at the expense of immediate service outages, you're not allocating your resources properly. It's like CEO saying they can't pay the server costs this week because they're writing a new compression algorithm that's "totally gonna fix things". 
I dont think this situation is acceptable. On chain capacity should have been increased to the extent it'll hold us over for n-layer solutions. Merchants should be able to buy coffee on-chain today, and when LN is ready just upgrade to that. Some of us believe in bitcoin but stopped believe in blockstream/core so here we are, and we're not all evil.

If both chains adopt LN then why wouldn't people adopt the chain that's cheaper to transact with? And if usable LN is 5 years away, how do you handle transaction volume in the mean time? That's a long time for volume to build up and hit outages / high fees.

Maybe it's just the natural market dynamic, but it seems like bitcoin the startup has turned into bitcoin the publicly listed bureaucracy. Which is fine, but I started investing in bitcoin because I'm rooting for the underdog.

No it shouldn't. How much wealth people have isn't your business. That's the point. It's not here for you or anyone else to take and redistribute.
Many of us don't care that the law was broken. The law is not the equivalent of some virtuous moral code. Those regulations are sponsored by the same cronies you point out.
Just because some non-violent criminals get sent to prison doesn't mean we should want the same for everyone else. Two wrongs don't make a right.

I think the rate of adoption for internet based solutions will spread at a much quicker rate than non-internet services due to the costs of scalability and the level of connectivity. Think along the lines of Instagram or SnapChat. One day you've never heard of them, the next day they're everywhere. That's hard to do with any of the other technologies you listed.

Judging by the vitriol in your response, I highly doubt it. You seem emotionally invested in your world-views, and anything that contradicts said views challenges your identity as a person and what you believe to be virtuous and moral. No offense, but debating with a fundamentalist christian would be more insightful than discussing ideas with you.

Thinking about adoption is interesting too. I think if bitcoin continues gaining traction and stability, small countries with monetary woes will be compelled to make a whole-sale switch to bitcoin. If the option is between a flailing currency or this stable digital currency, the answer might be made for them.
Imagine how the world would look in a place where banking isn't a function of government. Systematic warfare becomes nearly impossible. Market's can't be controlled via fiat. Can we kickstart a bitcoin nation please?

A third-party service would be more likely. Similar to how exchanges trade using an internal database and only use the blockchain for moving funds externally. I could just tell my main wallet to refill my microwallet when it dips past a threshold.

@_date: 2013-11-09 00:58:02
I also got rid of some of my shares after seeing such meteoric rises, but I think if we accept the notion that Bitcoin may one day be a market leader -- then X hundred dollar coins shouldn't be all that crazy because coins really are being undervalued. That said, you have to trust your gut and be happy with your huge upside. Cheers!

I feel they're doing a disservice to the community falsely advertising their capacity. If a merchant decides to try bitcoin and chooses Coinbase, it could leave a bad impression about bitcion.

I think this story is on-topic because it goes to illustrate a key advantage to crypto-currency in a real-life scenario. Managing money is expensive and dangerous. While bitcoins low processing fees and distributed nature is cool, try not getting killed for having a big "shoot me" sign that is cash-on-hand. Stores have signs about "Please dont pay with bills over 20", or "Safe not accessible to employees". I think this has been an understated selling point for bitcoin. No one will try and break into your (physical) store to steal your money! The bitcoin network is the equivalent of a armored truck with a foot of steel surrounding it. 
I'm hoping some people will see this article and say "I've got an uncle running one of those, I'll let him know about bitcoin". As far as the title, I'm open to suggestions. I just feel like appending "Bitcoin can be the solution!" is a little verbose. Good feedback though, I'm open to suggestions.
