Conduction Transactions is only a tiny fraction of the business model of banks. The real money is is loans and investment. Bitcoin won't change that.

Doesn't matter if you think there'll be a financial collapse soon. Apparently many of the very rich think so, they don't even mind negative interest rates if it means they can keep their wealth relatively safe.

But all the TA experts on reddit said that if btc can't hold 8000$, the next target would be 6000$!
They weren't talking out of their ass, how could this happen?
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:23:32
If the bitcoin can't hold the price, the price will go down

Have you looked at the fees from having an open position?
Besides, you can theoretically lose more than your funds in a flash crash if your position can't be liquidated fast enough.

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

If bitcoin rises 1% and then falls 2%, you get liquidated.
If bitcoin rises 5% and then falls 6%, you get liquidated.
If bitcoin doesn't move at all, your funds will be drained due to the fees of having an open leveraged position.

Well, as long as you have debts, you can't trade.
They have your identity, you uploaded your passport to the exchange. They can ruin your credit score if you don't pay, which can have significant impact on your life.
If it's a substantial amount of money, they will probably also sue you.
It's not very likely that the liquidation is too slow and you lose more than you invested, but it happens. If the price of bitcoin falls, and stop-loss orders get triggered, which cause more sells, which drop the price even more, which causes more stop-loss orders to get triggered ([Long squeeze]( this may happen.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:17:06
Then you make profit.
It's hard too not get too greedy, though. When do you sell? At 100% profit? At 300%? 
I played around with small amounts and high leverage, too.
I made some money for some time , but then I lost it all again.
I don't complain, I was aware of the risks a d did it half as a hobby.
It's definitely not risk-free money.
@_date: 2019-12-25 21:06:01
Did you read any of the terms and conditions? If they can't liquidate your position fast enough, you can and up owing the exchange money.
Take a look a on how bad this can go.

Good point, storage should be no issue.
But preventing the phone from going to sleep, keeping alive multiple connections at all times and validating new transactions is probably not ideal for most users.
Better buy a raspberry pi IMO.

SPV is still way better than paypal
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:33:09
I admit I didn't know that the default setting is now 14 days.   
And of course, once you broadcasted the TX and it isn't invalidated by a newer TX that has already been confirmed, it can theoretically still get confirmed even after months (you or anyone else could just rebroadcast it). I wasn't trying to spread misinformation, just trying to give practical advice to OP how he can fix his situation. Since I very much doubt that OP runs an own node or any other node rebroadcasts his transaction, I deemed it as irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-09-15 21:37:20
This is why having stop-loss orders on crypto is riskier than not having them
@_date: 2019-09-18 10:07:37
\&gt; That setting only is for that specific node. Setting it on your node and hoping that someone else doesn't retransmit it is just pointless and foolish.
I mean, you're not wrong, but since there is no incentive for anyone retransmitting a low-fee transaction again, I think this scenario is unlikely enough to not consider it. And OP was transacting to himself, even if someone would do it, no harm done.
\&gt; OP might have waited 48 hours, see no confirmation, assume everything was fine and then send the money again, resulting in recipient getting the money twice.
Nope. First, OP was transmitting money to himself. Second, he has a Ledger Nano S, which of course doesn't reuse addresses. It's impossible that both TX would confirm.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:06:55
Depends on the wallet. Which one did you use to send the transaction?
@_date: 2019-09-22 14:27:50
Sure, that's called a hard fork.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:11:14
Unfortunately, afaik the Ledger nano S doesn't support RBF. I guess you have to wait until is confirms or is dropped.
@_date: 2019-09-18 09:12:54


You just quoted my first sentence and then ignored the rest, where you basically repeat what I said. I was trying to help OP with his situation and get his transaction unstuck, not write a scientific text which would likely have caused more confusion than help.

For every short position, there is a long position that bets in the opposite direction. Futures should make the price more stable long-term. If you can't short an asset, bubbles are more likely, bubbles mean no one trusts the asset as it is too volatile.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:42:29
Of course, but I don't think the Ledger Nano Wallet supports that.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:28:59
According to the default duration is now 2 weeks. If it doesn't get confirmed withhin that period, it will drop out of all nodes with the default configuration and very likely never be confirmed. It as if you had never send the transaction, then. You will have your bitcoins back.   
But I looked at your transaction and it will probably be confirmed withhin a few hours. See [ for the average fees nowadays.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:56:35
The transaction is in the [mempool]( It stays there until a miner picks it up and puts it in a block. If that doesn't happen within the next \~48h, the tx will be cleared from the mempool and never be confirmed.
If you can't wait that long, you can use [RBF]( to increase the fees.
