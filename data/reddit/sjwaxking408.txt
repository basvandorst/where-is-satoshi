Man I conference called my buddies since I was watching. Told them all buy in more with half of whatever the got available to spend for the week and thank me for Christmas lol. 
The other half is for a dip to 12.1k or below just in case, don’t want coal for Christmas !
 We take the safe money over here.

Yeah gdax just broke so go home

Your missing the point all up and down the thread here.
If I don’t pay the taxes my life is potentially endangered by the government , one way or another financially or physically, period. Thats threatening. 
I’m forced to abide by a strict set of rules which leaves the majority of the population stuck in a cycle of poverty, even after doing things “the right way”.

LOL the old story of some young idiot who had some coins stored and forgot about them ������
This is going to be good!
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:24:00
Libra has the attention rn, all good
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:51:40
This the kind of dip a big group of money would profit from shortly �� I wonder .... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:33:40
Got you fam, been in Discord too much 
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:25:31
It’s a lot of sneaker flippers in the game too , by the look of it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:47
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:56:50
Oh this is not good news I imagine 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:39:06
How can these taxes be inflicted on us? I mean if I work under the table and put my cash into bitcoin, sell for a profit , and cash out... how will anyone be the wiser ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:41:45
Binance seems decent haven’t got into using it just yet
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:18:56
Frenzy is already opposite direction right now promoting Libra to the general public. Telling people that btc will be sold off because of Libra. 
It was on the news in CA yesterday.

He got RiPd. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:51:04
Alright sounds like solid advice thanks for the response and not berating me for swing trading lol, I am aware of the underlying tech and because of that have slot of interest in req enj and also iota. I’m going to be buying one for the discount alone since this is something I’ve committed a lot of attention to at this point I know I won’t regret buying the thing on sale.
So then as far as these forks go my best bet is going to be working with exchanges that support forks like binance ?
 It seemed unclear but I think if I had my coins on binance for these past 3 forks gold cash and now diamond I would have been granted the alt coins as well as having then on a viable exchange (binance) to resale those altcoins ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:46
So we blame... Apple??
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:20:09
This is good realistic point .... an alternative would be to deposit the money into your exchange (wait a few days for that transaction) then have the money available on your exchange to make an order (possibly with no fee)
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:42:17
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:36
Yeah what the fuck is going on? Shit just crashes hen bitcoin plummeted I’m heated right now
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:18:25
If you just start putting some money aside into bitcoin now those same grandkids will probably be rich then too ����

@_date: 2017-11-30 11:24:03
Well whenever this dumb ass bullshit is fixed maybe it will look better
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:06:43
Ok that’s better .
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:01
Yeah. Your trying to sell that’s what’s wrong hold that 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:37:45
Idk what your even talking about anymore lol , we’re talking about taxes.
Rich and poor people have to pay taxes, Hell a bum on the street has to pay tax if he goes and buys himself a beer or a burger. 
 Crypto does have potential to be a “magic cure” for these bullshit federal reserve extortions... stay focused on the topic kid. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:18:11
I’m pretty new here too, I’m liking to buy a ledger s but curious about it...
Will I have to pay some transaction fees to transfer to this wallet from gdax , and back?
How long does the process of sending and receiving usually take ?
I don’t have a significant holding I’m more learning to swing trade until I have a reasonable amount to diversify and hold some alts . That said will the ledger male participating in the forks easier because as it is I have been on gdax for the past 2/3 forks and missed out , ledger would have allowed me to cash in ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:51
That was proof of concept ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:07:34
Imagine how those fuckers are doing now if they had a pile of coin and held mostly �� they really lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:24
Well it would mean the exchange got hacked and were fucked out of the money
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:39:10
If you don’t pay taxes here there’s problems.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:43:19
You did. Come back ❤️

This is the moment we all been waiting for ������ and no I DONT mean to sell!
I’ve personally been waiting for these memes since I got into bitcoin modestly in July this year �� and I knew it was coming ! ☝️��
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:08
Quit trolling ��
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:48:17
I had been hearing good  things about binance over the past 2 months and recently saw it’s a top 10 or top 5 exchange now so I’m thinking I can trust these guys at binance . Their pretty good about making announcements about their stance on forks too seems like.
I’m definitely going to put an order in for one today just for peace of mind in case I decide to go the PK route over “trusting” exchanges to dole out my “free” alts in the future. 
And ideally once I’ve hit a decent level or trading power I will stop realizing profits in USD and just hold the profits as btc. At which point I will want to store them off the exchange (:
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:13:42
Bitcoin Cash sub looks the same way... I’m in btc. But god damn it if Bitcoin Cash isn’t lookingnlike btc did earlier this year
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:31:53
Yeah but this was over the weekend for the sale... wasn’t really the time to be spending lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:56:31
This looks like good news �� 
The bill pay service seems like a cool benifit if I could put some btc with the bank and use that to pay phone bills and stuff.
I didn’t notice and am curious how/if btc holds value once deposited... can I pay my bill real quick at 15k value if I think it’s going to correct to 14k That day? 
This is confusing to think about ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:00:33
That doesn’t make sense !  
I hope this is sarcasm because at this point there is no “dollars” .
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:44:47
I’m sad I didn’t sell my WoW account for bitcoin when I quit �� instead of a old ass account I could be sitting on god knows how many coins (likely a couple hundred at least if not more) from back in 2009/2010 when I thought why would I want any of these digital tokens ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:31:32
I can’t even get on it’s probably all set sell orders just dying ��
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:11:20

It was a win ! Right until bitcoin goes up 30% overnight and your not holding any...

Where we going up to 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:45:26
My biggest downfall is not trusting myself and doing nothing. 
That’s a good tip and the goal is definelty to grow my holding power ! Ideally I can work up to 4 full coins at least and then really start the game.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:59:21
Gotta realize you’ve lost this one. You defending a broken system that’s been broken and destabilizing for decades.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:26:50
Oh the forks have nearly nothing to do with my personal trading strategy (aside from their expected impact to the market). 
 Just seeing how Bitcoin Cash is being pump/dumped or finding ground as it’s own altcoin(idk which) , makes me feel like I need to at least be aware/prepared to participate in upcoming forks. 
I have no issue with hodling btc or other alts aside from my trading fund, but I dont want to completely miss out on every fork because I do believe some of them will have more value at some point than just doing a few trades during the high volitility around fork times. 
Your responses have been real helpful, thank you!

Can give or take them to be honest. Not a fan of those terms or those positions but I fully understand their -generally- held by normal working Americans. With a few righteous assholes sprinkled in there we could all do without in our day to day life.

Lol I love seeing these posts and helps to not feel like a bitcoin crazed tweaker ! 
I’m in the same boat telling every one of my friends, and every man woman and child I get a conversation going with. 
More than less don’t understand.
But I have a foundation in commission only sales, and I know the Law of Averages damn it! 
I’ve actually got 2 of my friends onto gdax and looking into Gemini in the last month and they have their first money invested!
I was told by a investor buddy whose word I trust when it comes to money a few months ago, he was told by his brother. 
Long live the coin!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:42
Well if we all just hold now it’s going to be okay
