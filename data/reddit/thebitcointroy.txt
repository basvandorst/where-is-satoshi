These crypto exchanges are sketchy as fuck - they definately dont have big money backing them to such a degree where they can afford high value infastructure

-HODLING works when you get in at the low.
-Bitcoin trades on hype cycles not fundamentals.
-Getting into BTC at the right TIME magnifies your returns 5 - 10X.

This comment is a breath of fresh air from all the bitcoin maximalism going around.

This is a very big deal and an industry first. I don’t think most people appreciate it. I spent a year in Canada trying to get a bitcoin trust approved through the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) - other than the usual “bitcoin is manipulated” - the only legal argument was the fact that there were no licensed custodians that had completed a SOC1 audit by a big 4 accounting firm. Once that box is checked one can literally go to the courts and make an argument against the regulator that they are over reaching their boundaries and utilizing their opinion versus fact in rejecting a btc trust. This is big news and I commend the winklevoss twins for committing their resources and time to getting this done. Legitimacy in this space is key and will help build the next “bull run” although I think we are 3 years from that.
