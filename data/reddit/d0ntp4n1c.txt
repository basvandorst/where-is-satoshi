That's the knowledge I had only I didn't know about the DoS attack portion. Haven't looked into it too much yet since it hasn't...well...launched. lol Thanks for the intel.

Turn dead, back here?

Launches? I'm confused as this article also mentions Darknet launching...have they already? Figured I would have come across a guide on how to access it by now if that's the case...

From a fellow artist its good work. But unknown people asking +600 is a bit steep.

Why would you waste your time arguing with a mac user? They already bought into the golden cow and she's damn pretty no matter how much logic you throw at it. /s Ask anyone high up in the IT world if they recommend mac products. The entire reason they are so successful is they took something that was SUPPOSED to be awesome and free then dumbed/locked it down so tight idiots couldn't fuck it up.

Since foxnews started  becoming disturbingly popular. You can still find it here and there but mainly in online stuff.

The entire reason Android is so predominate was it being open source. That's the reason major players like Samsung went with it. Samsung is actually moving towards their own os, tizen. Had Google forced vanilla Android I really doubt we would be sitting where we are today.

Pretty much what I was thinking. I work in IT and only admit to a rudimentary understanding of coins in general but aren't all the connotations based on the same source code? Technically they are all just Forks right?

Mine was a recent theater I worked at from 00 to 02 iirc and was built. Late 80s early 90s. We had 4 exits I can remember. Our setup was basically a loooong hallway with a quick / bend in the middle. Stairs on either send, roof ladder in the middle or so and the "booth"  door that was the main entrance. That job was one of my favorite. Zero interaction with the public and I got to watch free movies. Unless a tray of film got a bubble every day was cake. Talked a manager of another theater into a tour of the newer ones and I left very depressed that day.

I worked as a projectionist during my teenage years. BAck in the day before digital you had [this]( type setup. There were 12 theaters where I worked and the noise was.....loud. For me I got used to it pretty quick had some of the best naps of my life up in that booth. To this day I have a louder then average box fan that I have to sleep with or I don't get a good nights sleep. Scared to think of what I will do if it ever breaks down as the modern ones aren't near as loud.

This has been locked recently. I purchased instantly last week but today when I went to buy some more I was told it wouldn't go through until monday...
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:58:27
LOL My point exactly. I swear they try and keep this shit confusing on purpose. For all I know I could be wrong! XD This is just what makes logical sense to me and once I have explained it to friends they agree. 
  I have yet to have it happen as they have been instant for me lately and back in the day when I waited a week the prices didn't change that much. If someone out there thinks I am wrong please enlighten me! Socrates said it best "To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge."

Any idea on how long it takes to get verified?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:00:18
You can place an order for, lets say .44 bitcoin for 700 bucks today, but you will not receive said order until monday. On monday if 700 bucks only gets you .22 then that is all you get. Not the .44 that you originally clicked purchase on. While most people that get exchange rates and variances will get this, I have found most people don't really understand money on this level. People who I would consider having an adequate and even some cases high iq levels....

I was iffy when I saw them ask for a social but then saw the tier 2 options. Gonna attempt a purchase and see what happens....

How are you supposed to logically argue with someone who believes in a father figure in the sky who both loves and yet is willing to punish us for ALL OF ETERNITY for 70ish years of mistakes. (american prisons aren't even that bad) Or a guy who murders every innocent first born child in Egypt instead of the one fucker causing the problems? Sorry mate hard to beat christianity with logic

Huh? Are you trying to say to spend the money on bitcoins instead of smokes? Or is some nice person giving me bitcoins in exhange for smokes.

What an excellent counter point. Allow me to [retort]( In seriousness the reason you are getting downvotes is you are basically saying "here's this gift, but if you don't use it ima take it back" You don't give gift cards or any other gift in this way. A gift is exactly that. Something you GIVE to someone for them to do with as they wish. Judging from the quality of your replies to others I'm wasting my time and this will fall on deaf ears but I felt the need to *try*.

I understand it is not an exchange but them running it like one makes good business sense imo. Also how does the wording here "If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Monday Nov 25, 2013 at 12:30PM PST after your funds have arrived." not show what I said? Specifically "you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Monday Nov 25"? (not taking out of context just pointing out)
EDIT: Spelling
  EDIT II: Adding their "read more"
  Due to higher than normal buy volumes, we are unable to provide exact price quotes right now.
Instead of pausing buys entirely, we decided to give people the option to purchase bitcoin at the market price in a few days. Once your USD funds arrive, we will exchange them to bitcoin at the market price at approximately Monday Nov 25, 2013 at 12:30PM PST.
Note that you can cancel your order at any time up until your bitcoin arrive from the transfer history page.
The market price of bitcoin changes frequently. Below are some recent prices to give you an idea. These do not guarantee what the price will be in a few days.

I need .44 bitcoin today and cash in hand. Prove it.
