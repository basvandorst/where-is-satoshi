Congrats on our independence day w/0 UASF(not yet, anyway)
I have been meaning to shift my coins from LocatBitCoin to my electrum.
1. Is LBC safe unlike coinbase ?
2. Is it okay to shift coins now ?
3. In case LBC is unsafe and doesnt support BCC, at least my BTC coin will do just fine right? Perhaps I wont get split ratio-ed BCC.
4. Any major problem when 2x fork happens?
5. Electrum vs mycellium. I think though consensus is towards electrum.
Oh BTW, HODL af \m/

At the time of posting this and as can be seen in the picture the coin was at 1981$ and today, 3141$ !!
That is the pure repayment for strong hodlers ! 
(oh btw I am not going to succumb to the temptation of selling anytime soon cuz, I got my visa to the moon son ;)
Thanks from India to everyone who helped clearing the FUD and; congratulations.

I am going to be alive. Its 2040 when last coin is expected to be mined.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:20:00
Ha ! 9.3k today? 2k seems so puny ��
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:11:14
Ha ! It touched 5k. Jesus ! 
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:02:17
Yes indeed. Its exactly 10% but I guess that 10 comes from the current market values of bch vis-a-vis btc.

Fellow hodlers,
Would you pls recommend what are my options to buy btcs other than lbc paypal?
I am exhausted trying with umpteen exchanges/portals ranging from kraken, coinmama, wesellcrypto et cetera et cetera, you know the pain now!
I aim not to go for margin trading, rather,
hodling for the long run. 
SIDE NOTE:
My risk appetite as of today is 2btc, 
Traders with viable transaction mediums are most very welcome. PM! 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:18:59
Or. It rallies up 4k$ post segwit (and probably 10k$ eventually) and we $ cost avg satoshis instead.
Mr. Moonwalker. Username checks out. Off to moon. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:11:49
Woah! 80 coins? Definitely 13 is the fact under limelight here but still,
Mining? That rig must be in like couple hundred THs?
Or margin trading? 
I can use some pointers. 
PM for the love of hodling? :D
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:21:12
Only if I was aware of those times. Could get my modest core2duo mining gold! 
But hey, never too late into the game, that being essence of this ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:15:20
Ha! Its LBC mate.
The coin is going to bread or mycelium soon and then will hodl through the rough rides of segwit.

What are you my girlfriend now? XD
Nah. I am on a roaming spree across Indian metros. 
Next week itself has check ins at Mumbai Delhi Bangalore. So, roaming!
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:35:31
I see.
But same thing we can do if we use credit card to pay, even if the medium is bank transfer, perfect money, okpay, 
We can still reverse the credit card transaction.

Our boy Bittu is going for the home run

Yes, Bittu's astonishingly, masochistically, intimidatingly,  humongously,  Indian name!
Live with it [`_´]

Thanks much kind Sir.
Its just not everyday that we aim to start (rather end, here in India) our day loosing close to half a grand!

Hi! 
I am midway through reading 'Mastering bitcoin - 2'
Seems like my qns would'v'd answered by themselves had I read the book before.
Still a qn : Apps create bitcoin addresses using RIPEMD of SHA256 of public key which comes from ECM of private key! 
Fine, but how does it ensure that addr generated hasnt appeared already in the blockchain?
Even more so, many apps work offline and provision address. Now if a transaction goes through and once p2p nodes interact wouldnt this redundant address cause chaos as the new node vs PoW consensus blockchain?
Perhaps a global Bloomfilter could have helped?
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:39:53
No kind Sir or; rather GrilledBurger XD

Jesus! You are autistic
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:24:43
For sure. I am reading as much as I can.
A man needs to know behind-the-scenes of the tech when hes knee deep in it already.
Still it'hd help if you could share your knowledge pertaining to some qns above?
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:16:02
Thank you so much. It is at 77 now.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:10:13
Thanks for the pointers. I'v added the book in my next 2 weeks' todo!
By any chance do you happen to have version2 link/pdf of the same book? It has segwit and lightening as new chapters.
But apparently only pre release paid version is available.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:14:19
Thanks much! Thats a lot of effort you put.
I am going to get into the satoshi's ref client code as well as Antonopolous's book.
Those 9 pages really make a person overwhelmed and a lot desired.
Will revert here if I happen to have cross qns.

Hi there! 
I recently bought 400$ worth of coins.
They havent yet credited to my LBC wallet although 3 hrs have passed and num of confirmations it shows is 0
1. is it even possible that block(s)(?) having this transactions' details never get confirmed?
2. LBC just changed my receiving addr. Is this fact the culprit?
3. Is it not recommended to share your receiving addrs?
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:49:47
I know about the possibility of having same output hash is astronomically (for the lack of even more extensible word) small.
But hey, my qn is from HLD pov that how do we tackle duplicates? 
A mere looping over all the addresses for the new addresses being generated is an overkill (read as O(oldAddr_num*newAddr_num))
Perhaps a bloomfilter could help?
By 2nd qn I meant to ask if some old transaction had happened long back and that block is well within consensus blockchain and now we generated same address wouldnt that form false double spend problem?
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:34:33
Just bought in at 2.3k
Day-starts with price change notifications and the adrenaline pump on riding the btc coaster!
It only gets better \m/
