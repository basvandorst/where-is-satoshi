Six of one, half-a-dozen of the other; stupidity is not gender specific.


At least you admit it.


Try to remind yourself daily.

No, and the fact that this is what you took from my statement tells me you and people like you shouldn't be anywhere near monetary policy because you would plunge us all into economic freefall out of sheer stupidity.

You have been banned from participating in r/Pyongyang. Glorious Leader is most Glorious HODLer!

Yes it is.


This must be why it's killed 1.6 billion people in the past 400 years. Prompted military campaigns in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Prompted slavery, colonialism, and imperialism. Oh, then there's the [wage theft of tens of billions by owners of capital]( That looks ethical and moral, huh? Okay.


Why? On what rational basis is the fact that a large federal bureaucracy is necessary to maintain the standard of living for 325 million people "immoral"? Can you even explain that?


Taxes are the only thing that stand between your relatively easy life as it is now, and the life of a 16th Century serf. Taxes provision public goods like clean water and air, defense, public utilities, police, fire response, and roads. Disabuse yourself of the notion that you would survive in a Hobbesian State of Nature quickly, because you would be just as much prey as the serfs Rand believes are so lucky to be wage slaves to the capitalists, piggie.


Enjoy it, because when it's Mueller Time your fever dream is over.

You can't even spell *bottom* and you think you should have **any** control over monetary policy? That alone tells me you shouldn't.

Nah. I'm done playing with my toys; I just didn't have time to clean up last night, Mr. "I don't debate leftists."

It does not; this is precisely why there's been a fork into Bcash and BTC. If the majority set policy then Bcash would have vaporized, but it's still here.

Nah, I'm good where I'm at. I'm not afraid of my worldview being challenged.

[Atlas Sucked]( and other revelations that come to you with a more complete understanding of economics, and political theory.
Doesn't it strike you as odd everything Rand claims as the result of "improperly regulated" laissez faire economics are actually things that happen in an unregulated environment?
A good example that is happening now in Comcast's near-immediate revocation of any promise to respect Net Neutrality on the same day Pai indicated he is rolling it back. But hey, it's the regulations that cause them to do bad shit, not the lack thereof, right?
You need to evolve intellectually, dude.

It's true, what they say--ignorance is bliss.
