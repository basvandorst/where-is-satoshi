This is a scam and a phishing site
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:13:40
Next crash inc soon then. :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:36:44
No it's not.. It's in sync.. This is some serious shit.
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:56:08
Sad to say but it looks really noobish. That's not design.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:13:08
Thanks!! Merry Christmas
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:40:45
Not to worry? I would prefer not to loose money since I can't close my order... seriously
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:53:24
601 comes after 626
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:12:11
No it's not.. It's server side.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:21:18
Boycott it
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:57:34
Bobby seems a bit scared. :)

Get a wallet app for your smartphone.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:10:12
Foil hat on!
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:35:17
I'm was more referring to cities where Bitcoin are being early adopted or has startup companies, meetup groups, stores etc. that accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:03:10
So what is up in Amsterdam? Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:16:54
Well, I've used them 4-5 times and it worked fine every time. They are a legit company so hang in there. No panic.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:22:06
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:38:47
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:45:38
Well the adaption and revolution of using the technology will be centered somewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:44:31
Withdrawing BTC from exchanges usually takes days.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:04:37
I would say we will know in 3-5 hours.
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:10:52
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:12:24
Yes it's very legit. Just log in and it should say when the BTC should be delivered.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:01:52
Yes, if you haven't invested in an ASIC mining rig from the future you will spend more in electricity costs than you will earn back from BTC. Good Luck!
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:02:03
It's not worth buying a mining rig. You will not get a return on investment with the current technology
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:03:56
Vancouver had the first ATM right? What have Montreal to add to the table?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:28:05
 has merchant tools that you can use.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:58:22
I've heard but I truly don't hope so. I would prefer a country with non fascistic tendencies would represent. Fascism rhymes bad with the freedom of decentralization.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:32:33
I would read this first!
Warning - investing in cloud mining GHS with cex.io will lose money
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:21:45
Oh shit.
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:10:48
Please try to make a longer example why Singapore should be nominated.
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:14:58
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:12:56
I would quote this old Chinese saying: "The best time to plant a tree is 30 years ago; the second best is today"
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:37:07
More scam
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:53:56
With the current neo-fascist trends in Greece I don't think that will ever happen.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:25:11
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:37:55
Oh the spam and scam.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:36:48
Going up now.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:42:01
What country are you located in? Try to find a local BTC exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:27:06
Those pictures are from Asciminer - 
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:48:55
Ok thanks - 
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:42:17
Coinbase.com have merchant tools.
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:48:28
Well made!
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:49:16
If you're part of EU just use bitcoin.de
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:14:08
Sound like a scam!
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:21:47
Too many WINS, this is a scam.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:09:09
Guess time will tell
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:02:32
Who wants to go to Pakistan? Raise a hand! Lol
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:16:59
Works fine here
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:33:13


I really would love examples of the current state of Bitcoin use or businesses that are on the forefront of adapting the technology.
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:56:50
Scam and spam
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:11:12
If you had only googled than you would have known in advance.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:17:28
They are smart keeping people assets in cold storage.
