I don't have that feeling at all. I remember the time, and to me the chart looked very good technically. Now, it looks like the aftermath of Y2K Nasdaq bubble. It took years and years to clear away. While I don't expect it to take many years with bitcoin, there's no significant change in the psychology. All bulls who stick their heads out, get hammered down quickly.

It is possible blockchain.info's maintenance break had something to do with it (ref. average_ita_guy's message). However, blockchain.info has been up for some time now, so maybe Kraken has some sort of backlog of transfers to clear.

I agree, though it is kinda sad we're deliriously happy every time somebody in the bitcoin community does *not* steal our money. Honesty should be the default value. Of course, this makes it easy to trust one's coins to Dooglus next time as well.
In this case, I'm not sure it would have been a smart idea to take the money and run. The owner's identity is known, but you never know what beasts you have amongst the clients. And KYC wouldn't help there at all.

I am bullish on a short term. Yet, markets don't go that often from a burst bubble directly into an uptrend. There could be repeated disappointments/deep recoils, which make a sideways trend. If this goes up the way bitcoin goes up, we'll hit $2,500 by the new year, and I just don't believe that.

The news is price neutral hoarding-wise, but price positive in the sense that the bitcoin economy is developing. 
Netflix's annual sales is 4+ billion dollars. If 1% of that were in bitcoin, that would be 40 million dollars worth of coins. If they didn't convert back to dollars, the net impact on bitcoin price would be similar to one of those bitcoin investment funds. I think everybody expects Netflix and similar companies to dump their coins, and they're right. No problem there.

Stop asking this. There are a lot of people who want to trade bitcoin - you know, buying and selling, sometimes both during the same day. The 'solution' here is NOT that everybody just deposits their btc into Armory on their old laptop. For starters, there might be no solution. 
Online stockbrokers e.g. in Europe are very reliable. You never hear them closing shop and running with client funds. I just don't get why bitcoin exchanges couldn't be the same. Is there something in the tap water, that makes bitcoin service providers disappear with clients' coins?

They have been proven to be owned by MtGox, which claims it was hacked and does not own any coins. At the very minimum, SatoshiDice should contact MtGox and ask heads up about the situation. **What reason could MtGox have to send their client funds to SatoshiDice?** Absolutely none, unless it is a hacker or Mr. Karpelès trying to launder coins.


Agreed, but this currency isn't also going nowhere if bitcoin service providers accept stolen money. Freezing the coins and asking for clarification from MtGox and Japanese authorities would be the right thing to do. Just because you don't like the authorities, is no reason to let a bank robber off the hook.

Actually what I wanted was that a borrower would only be able to cancel after 24 hours has gone since initiating the borrowing. In that way, there would be some predictability for lenders. Or, at least some small penalty for canceling only after a few hours. For example, today I had to lend the same money all over again, many times. I lent for 30 days and it would have been nice if the deal would have lasted at least until tomorrow. But because the rates fell, it was advantageous for the borrower to cancel. Lenders do not have the same luxury, we can't cancel those cheap deals when the rates go up.
Your suggestion is not bad either, could even be better. Though I suspect it would be better only for borrowers, as 1-2 day lending offers are way below 30-day offers.

You would lend them for much less than 25% at Bitfinex. There the borrower can't take it out of the system. He sells the coins, and expects to profit because of falling btc prices. If bitcoin goes up instead, the borrewer gets a margin call, and you as a lender are more or less protected.
If one wants to sell short bitcoin, Bitfinex is a good way to go.

I disagree to some extent.

**Old news.** Already last summer the Finnish tax authority declared bitcoin not a currency, but a digital goods. Not unlike a sofa kids buy at [Habbo hotel]( Tax-wise it receives a similar unfair treatment as CFDs do: you pay the hefty 30% capital gains tax, but can't deduct losses. 
Not a problem, though. At these tax rates and rules, I doubt many bother to declare their profits. I, for one, couldn't care less about what the Finnish government or tax authorities think about bitcoin. Translating an outburst from somebody: *A taxpayer is a slave, a worthless dog whose masters laugh at it, while kicking it.*
If one wants to put a positive spin on things: the Finnish tax authority was one of the first to take a stance on bitcoin taxation. That should've removed all uncertainty regarding taxation from bitcoin startups in this country. Also, banks don't harass you in this part of the World, just because you send or receive fiat to/from a bitcoin exchange.

Contrast the treatment of Bitinstant vs. the treatment of [HSBC, Wachovia, ING, Standard Chartered banks](
So, Gox's only option is to comply. The ongoing investigations make it difficult for them to get a good banking connection. Probably the authorities have placed a fixed limit on their withdrawals. It there was no outside pressure, it would not be difficult for them to have unlimited withdrawals.

This money laundering 'threat' has been blown out of proportion. If somebody really has a need to launder money, he won't be using bitcoin, but instead establishes e.g. a luxury hotel, a guesthouse or some business where a lots of cash moves.

About eight billion of value has disappeared since the China bubble burst. New money flowing in and value lost through falling prices, are not comparable. Yet, I'd say a few hundred million dollars is not even going to take us above the previous top. Remember, that was $1,200 and now we're at $450.


An institutional investor could buy their coins through e.g. Exante's trading platform and keep their coins safe at Xapo. However, none of the current exchanges fits the definition of "institutional level infrastructure". All the big ones are still too shady. The situation would change overnight, if some stock exchange, such as NasdaqOMX listed bitcoin. A growth market like First North would do fine. The problem is, bitcoin hardly fits the existing settlement &amp; custody system.

What, exactly, would you like to question? That there are better ways for money laundering than bitcoin? Even the FBI guy at the Congressional hearing acknowledged that. If you doubt the HSBC case, just read the article from Rolling Stone.
I've lived in a crisis area (Balkans), which was flooded with international money, developed into a major drug trafficking route, and was with totally corrupt government.

A day or two ago the orderbook was full of 2-day lending offers below 0.1%. If you offered at 0.15% for 30 days, it did not even show on the screen. Now that bitcoin has shown some signs of life, every 30-day offer below 0.25% gets taken quickly. I can't quantify the difference in demand long vs. short, but think the market would work better with a bit more separation in loan periods.
Would a lending service support btc value? Perhaps, but it could also just make the upswings quicker, because those who borrow to buy bitcoins are mostly traders, not long term investors.

If the exchange requires adequate margins and has a proper risk management system, it is very unlikely, that kind of thing should happen. In bitcoin's case, almost 100% margin should be required from those who sell put options. Selling covered calls is not risky for the counterparty - the seller has the coins, if needed.
The real risk is getting goxxed or zhou tonged by the exchange itself.

Right now the money is good, but not always. One problem is, borrowers want longer term (30 days), lenders offer short term (2 days). This creates a mismatch, where borrowers have unrealistically low expectations. They would do better by separating the loan market into two: "less than a week" &amp; "longer than a week".
Calculating a real return is difficult, because borrowers are allowed to cancel at any time. This is understandable, as they only need it for as long as they keep their bitcoin position. Still, borrowers often borrow more than they need, and cancel the more expensive ones. From lender's point of view, it makes things difficult: you though you had your money invested, but five minutes after you walk out of door, the borrower cancels and your money earns no interest.
I would commit much more money there, if the system were more predicable, e.g. guaranteed minimum 24 hours loan duration. During those times the rates are low, I earn more by arbitraging elsewhere. Recently the rates were so low, I withdrew some money and bought stocks.

There are some risks with that. The Canadian feds could raid the site, or the owner could disappear. I'll give bigger odds for the former than the latter. From what I've heard, the site security is good, so it is unlikely they get Zhou Tonged. BTC betting being a grey area means it is open to interpration from the authorities' side, and the Canadian authorities open to pressure from the U.S. feds' side. 
Also, since the edge is just 1%, P/L swings can be huge, as was the case with gambler whales 'Nakowa' and 'Fuckit'. Apart from these, Just-dice is fine, but does not offer any kind of guaranteed return.

You are exaggerating the effect of Satoshi selling his coins. Sure BTC would collapse, but it seems to collapse every four mouths, so what's new? Also, you're assuming Satoshi has no interest in the amount of fiat he gets, but would sell in a way to effect maximal economic damage to himself. What a strange assumption! Also, you're assuming he would dump his coins on bitcoin exchanges, and not by arranging private placements with investment funds. Moreover, Satoshi gets diluted every day by mining, so the problem gets smaller.
After he would be done with selling, there would not be any Satoshi overhang anymore = better bitcoin. Satoshi selling his coins is definitely not the end of bitcoin.

It is not surprising. Recently Russia has made all the wrong moves. Its banks will be isolated from the Western payment networks. If things get worse, possibly even Western Union and Moneygram will have to cease their operations there. Bitcoin would be beneficial for Russia, but Putin and Kreml do not care about benefit, but about concentrating all power into their own hands.
There will be more underground economy, just like during the Soviet times. Perhaps they will adopt bitcoin.

Also, I guess a large percentage of clients are foreigners, just passing by and looking for a way to spend time. If a credit card is not an option, many people are justifiably cautious about carrying large amounts of cash with them in a foreign city. Maybe not an issue with 100-200 euros.
It protects the escorts themselves, perhaps, as there is no cash for anybody to steal.

The more bitcoin is connected to the business world (retailers, Wall St. etc.), the more they want to keep bitcoin 'kosher' for the authorities.

I agree, but it isn't that simple. For starters, no responsible institutional investor would pour their money in blindly, without observing what it does to the market. If small amounts lift the price considerably, there is no point in investing big, because one has to get out as well.

The Great Depression happened despite U.S. government having all the necessary monetary tools. Some people think the Fed caused the Great Depression with its policy of low interest rates in 1920's. Low interest rates -&gt; boom -&gt; bust ...sounds familiar?
It is a silly Keynesian dream one would not have to face the consequences of a reckless financial policy. Governments eventually drive the purchasing power of their fiat currencies to the ground, to the detriment of citizens. All the QE the U.S. and EU central banks have done in the past years, only makes things worse eventually.
Governments do not need more power &amp; control. They need less of it. The future belongs to decentralized systems, as they're more efficient and robust. You can't trust government money, as it is political money. Bitcoin's blockchain is based on mathematics, not politics.

Seems so, but they made a wrong choice. I'm trying to log in, and their Incapsula gatekeeper denies access. I haven't had any problems with sites using CloudFlare.
Bitstamp should take a long, hard look on what's happening. Bitcoin trading volume is growing, and if they want to remain in the game, they have to stay competitive. At the moment their trading fees are high'ish, compared with e.g. Bitfinex and Kraken. Site downtime, especially on high-volume days, is even worse. The problem with Bitstamp is already in the site design. They have useless features, such as showing the full orderbook. Those clog the bandwith, and then nobody's trading.
I guess those guys keep their eyes on MtGox, and do not notice some smaller players have better functioning sites. MtGox and Bitstamp are like Altavista and Yahoo! of bitcoin trading, some newer ones could become Google.

Sorry guys... Honestly, I'm not trolling, but I call B.S. on this article. 
1) China is not "wanting to dominate" bitcoin. They simply haven't decided on it yet. The Chinese have a large tolerance for 'gray area' activities. The Chinese Govt could still outlaw bitcoin enterprises.
2) As of 5 min ago, Baidu Jiasule's service has netted about 1.38 bitcoin. Talk about 'integrating btc across its vast network of users' is way, way premature. 
Even if the article was highly speculative and based on false premises, it is not worthless. It tickles America's insecurities about China's rise. This is the thumb screw that should be used vs. the U.S. government, to prevent them from going gung-ho on bitcoin.

If I had to guess Nakamoto's identity, I'd say Martti Malmi.

* did the 1st bitcoin transaction
* left the stage at the same time as Nakamoto
* writes flawless English
* Has studied Japanese language 
* interested in libertarian thought
Also, consider the following snippet from an interview:
"Whoever Satoshi really is, Malmi said, he will probably never reveal himself, and that we should all stop caring who he is. 
"He just doesn't want to be in spotlight, he wants to go on with his job and his other projects. He maybe saw possible the significance, the political implications, and didn't want any pressure."

Basically the choice is between money and freedom. Going the Gov't &amp; NSA way will bring bitcoin closer to mainstream, and maybe some short-term profits for investors. In the process, bitcoin will lose most of its revolutionary power. 
Choosing freedom means continuing the fight by adding extra layers of anonymity and resilience. The current bitcoin is good for Europe, China and Hong Kong. So, the fight is not completely lost, even if the U.S. goes forward with its greenlist. 
Like it was said in the vid, you can't have it both ways. If needed, bitcoin can survive without the "foundation".

High price as an indicator of acceptance: I meant the amount of users. For example, it is clear the Chinese had a bubble just a few days ago. That bubble was probably caused by an influx of many new people into bitcoin. Next peak will be higher still, with even wider userbase. The more users, the more useful the currency. If merchants are lagging now, they will follow if/when more people adopt it, and the legislation is there. China is looking good, but it is far from a done deal.
After some point, bitcoin may achieve some sort of critical mass, a point of no return if you will. This will be different for each country. The best chances are in the Third World, where inflationary government fiats &amp; lousy/non-existing banking does not put up much resistance. The challenges there are mainly with technology &amp; infrastructure. Things like internet penetration and reliability, smartphone penetration, existence of localized bitcoin apps.
In my opinion, the most decisive factor for bitcoin's future is, whether those "other blockchain services" appear or not. If yes, it could be HUGE. Currently I think we're overextended, but I don't know what kind of stuff is in the pipeline.

I dabbled a bit with icbit.se, but found their fees quite high. There's the Hong Kong site 796.com. It seems their futures expire daily, so it is more about short-time betting.
Bitfinex is like you explained. Their fees are low (a bit higher for trades routed to Bitstamp). The risk is, you need to cover your short in a hurry, but can't route your order to Bitstamp, and the Bitfinex orderbook is relatively thin.

I was not talking about today's price. Just look at the Chinese chart, check the relative tops &amp; bottoms, and you'll see what I mean. The Chinese market topped at 7588. The next top was clearly lower (around 7032), while e.g. in Bitstamp and Gox the next run almost reached all time high. After the market fell from that top, in China it reached below the previous dip. Not at Bitstamp or Gox.
I maintain: the Chinese market has been lackluster after reaching all time high. A part of the reason is, their all time high was way overvalued (compared to other exchanges). But seems also, they've lost the initial vigor. Also the falling number of Chinese bitcoin nodes supports this.

Bitcoin has been on some institutional investors' radar for quite some time. The small size of bitcoin market cap, illiquid exchanges and undeveloped trading interfaces have thus far prevented them from joining the party. Since bitcoin's market cap is now past 10 billion USD, the size is less and less of an issue for smaller funds. Some may be already looking for an entry point, which is challenging as the chart is parabolic. Regarding liquidity and trading interface, I'd say Exante (Malta) was ahead of the pack.

* High prices do not give Bitcoin any more or less viability.
The utility of a currency to its owner depends on how widely accepted it is (network effect). Higher prices in itself do not make bitcoin more viable, but they're an indication of acceptance. The more users, the more likely you can use bitcoin as a means of payment with somebody else.
* Will merchant or customer adoption grow fast enough to justify the price of Bitcoin?
Why worry? If there's no connection with price and viability (like you claimed), bitcoin will be just as viable at $7 as at $700.
In response to your question, merchant adoption is lacking, also bitcoin transactions as a percentage of merchants' total sales is probably negligible at this point. The good news is, merchant adoption is not everything. It is quite probable other services (such as notary) will be built on the blockchain. Even now, bitcoin has an edge in remittances, it just needs entrepreneurs and infrastructure. But yes, short/intermediate bubbles are not just possible, they're probable.
* Is there a legitimate threat from competing currencies, or future institutionally-backed crypto-currencies?
The threat from altcoins is low. This is because of network effects (see the first question). Any altcoin to replace bitcoin at this point would have to be drastically better. Currently altcoins range from marginally better to worse. A government coin would be a serious contender, but you see, it would be only as credible as the government itself. For many bitcoin users, the credibility of the U.S. dollar is not that great. Why would it be any different with a Fed issued altcoin? Most probably a government altcoin would have worse qualities than bitcoin (less privacy, higher transaction fees, open-ended money printing enabled). A government can force its citizen-slaves into an inferior gov't altcoin, but it can not force them out of bitcoin.
* Is the lack of any "real value" a threat to Bitcoin.
What is the "real value" of your dollars? Is it a big deal to convert some of your bitcoin to fiat to pay taxes? Merchants can exchange bitcoin to fiat automatically, if they so desire. What is the "real value" of those Pamp Suisse gold ingots I own? I don't have a clue. So, I find the question too elusive to come up with a clear answer. "Real value" should be clearly defined in order to be able to discuss it.

There is no way to find out the true elasticity, especially as it changes from moment to moment. Also there is no way to beforehand find out the reaction of different market participants. There are just too many moving parts, so all estimates are just wild guesses. 
However, if you look at the volume, you can guess it is possible to buy $1-2 million worth without moving the market too much. Especially if you spread it to different exchanges. Repeat it the next day and the next, and you may start seeing some effect.
Would any fund really continue buying, if even meager investments would ~~skyrocket~~ moonrocket the price? I doubt it. They would just conclude the liquidity is not there, and stop buying. Also, funds do not look only how to get in, but also if it is possible to get out. Typically, during market crash the volume just dies, or can be found only from a ridiculously low level. No sane investor would try to get in with $1 billion at this point, even if he was able to scale into that position gradually. I suspect when the Feds are done with DPR, they'll get lots of private placement bids for a full amount of those SR coins.

Bitcoin does not fit into Peter Schiff's current business model. He would need to reinvent himself, and that's not  easy. He can't put his clients funds into btc, the volatility and risk of ruin is just too big. Moreover, for those entering bitcoin at this point, the risk of coming late to the party looks substantial. 
He probably gets a lot of questions and flak from clients, who would rather have been in bitcoin than gold the last six months. An easy way out is to explain, "Ok, but it is going to end up badly, I'm not going to put my clients' money into a ponzi scheme". Like any person who has a lot of strong opinions, Peter Schiff has painted himself into a corner.

Putin = FSB. During Yeltsin's time, oligarchs, party officials, random opportunists etc. stole all they could. FSB took control, Putin at the helm. They maybe cleaned the biggest criminals, but also took control of the most lucrative industries. In Russia, the state apparatus became the mafia. Whenever in trouble, they use patriotism to control people.
I guess China is how you described. An average Chinese is in a very difficult situation vs. his retirement. No social security, and because of the One Child Policy, they can't count on children to maintain them in old age. Negative interest rate on bank deposits, unreliable/scammer stock market, housing bubble... No reliable way to save for retirement, except maybe gold and now bitcoin.

When Al Gore invented bitcoin, he did it openly. Later, out of modesty, he decided to keep it secret. So he hacked our brains, and planted false memories about Satoshi Nakamoto.

Higher fees would be counterproductive. It would create miners an incentive to add transactions from those addresses into the block. This is why cartels like OPEC don't work well (= it pays to cheat). 
Refusing transactions from the greenlisted accounts would be better. Also, the major exchanges should tumble withdrawals as a default.

Short answer: the U.S. Senate can't help, they can only cause harm. Bitcoin does not need any "help" from politicians.

Kraken (Sweden), as already mentioned by jespow.
Also Bitstamp (Slovenia) beats MtGox, at least SEPA works fine there. Bitfinex (Hong Kong) is also good, though no SEPA with them, and also not licensed. I'd go with Kraken immediately.

1. Orderbook tells basically nothing. New sell orders appear, if the price rises.
2. Gox is only one exchange, second or third largest. Luckily, there's much more depth to the market than Gox.
One billion can push the market to $50,000, but only if some idiot decides to buy it all in one sitting, whatever the cost. Idiots like that are not employed by funds.
A better way to look at this is, the 30-day volume of the 4 biggest exchanges is about 4.1 million btc. So, it would take about 10 days of all bitcoin exchanges' volume to invest $1 billion. Obviously that is not going to happen, but maybe someone could scale into a $1 billion position in say, 2-3 months, with maybe 100-200% price rise. Less, if he would begin buying during a market crash.

It would be a good idea to have one. Would be in line with bitcoin's decentralized nature. Maybe such a thing could be built on unSYSTEM's current setup, while adding members from e.g. Europe and China.

Read  and similar blogs. If you browse their older postings, you'll find articles like "best second passports" etc. You'll find information about taxation as well.
There are countries that give you permanent residency relatively easily. Some of them do not tax foreign income, or tax it lightly. If you're 50+, a pensioner scheme might work. The real trouble is, Uncle Sam does not let you go easily. Therefore, Better call Saul.

*All* the bills are issued by the Federal Reserve. They are a shady bunch of crooks. Unconstitutional, too. So, if you want to avoid dirty money, go 100% for bitcoin, gold and silver.

Who said their voluntarism is needed? The U.S. Government will require anyone doing bitcoin business in the U.S. to jump onboard the *greenmail*. All the big ones will cave in, trust me. Later, the U.S. will push this idea to the European Union as an anti-money laudering measure, probably successfully.

How about, if you can show you bought your bitcoins e.g. at Bitstamp &gt; 1 year ago? You could send the coins back to the exchange and convert to euros, in that way you would have a purchase &amp; sale date. This leaves open the question, what happened to the coins during that period, but maybe the tax authorities aren't interested in that.

For the Big Boys, whover they be, an asset with just $15 billion money stock is still a curiosity, not a contender.

The U.S. military is a liability to the U.S. dollar. All those aircraft carriers have to be financed somehow, and that's done by issuing debt. Yes, every now and then, the military is used to attack other countries to secure "U.S. interests". Still, those wars just end up piling on more debt, which will sooner or later wipe out dollar's status as a reserve currency.

I wouldn't be surprised. Everybody's seen that video. Likewise with the Gendal Brown video. But... watch them again, they're good.
