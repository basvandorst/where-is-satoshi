I purposely put all my BTC on a Ledger Nano S. It keeps me from selling because I’d have to go through two steps to sell. 1-transfer to exchange. 2-sell. Because I don’t want to be tempted, I keep BTC offline on cold storage. I bought in May and have NEVER sold.

Just throwing in my comment: I ordered two ledgers from Amazon Prime. I read other comments that this was “dangerous” because the retailers were not verified through Ledger. So what I did was set up the Ledger, entered my pin wrong 3x, then reset the Ledger again to create a new seed that couldn’t have been tampered with although I don’t think it was, I’d rather be safe than sorry.

I am the wife. I manage all of our hodlings. My husband and I are equally focused on BTC and are borderline obsessed.

I have also been day-trading. Some days are definitely better than others. Since I bought in so low, I’ve been able to make some decent trades and accumulate more BTC in the process. Gotta love crypto.

I also do not have any expert advice of day trading. It really is a luck thing for me. Because I bought in low, I can technically “afford” to lose on a bad trade. I use Gemini and Bittrex because there you can place a buy/sell order for a specific amount. I also bought some Alt coins that I observed fluctuating enough to at least profit about $50-$100 a Day. Mostly I sell and rebuy BTC.

I bought two more at $5500. It’s never too late.

That is correct. However they don’t trade LTC. Only BTC and ETH. For LTC you’d have to go to Bittrex. They process isn’t as easy to follow but I watched a YouTube video to learn how.

I keep buying. Just because I bought my first at $1300 doesn’t mean I stopped there. I’ve bought more and more and just again at $5500. Today’s high is eventually going to be a low at some point.

Anytime is a good time to buy. I just bought more at $5500

So true. Unfortunately people I have told act like them buying BTC will benefit me. That’s why I I share my happiness on Reddit with my fellow BTC enthusiasts.
