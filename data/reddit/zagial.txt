"Unlikely" really depends on the future, doesn't it? How "likely" are these projections if parts of the world start spiraling into (deeper) financial stress, and that banks are to blame in a big way (again). If the dominoes start falling, you can wipe your ass with the regulations this time, people aren't falling for it anymore.
See, there is no "blockchain startup" to watch out for when it comes to usurping banks. There is however the decentralized Bitcoin network, which people can turn to when they realize that banks are corrupt and outdated, no usurping necessary.


Oh you mean like a decentralized network that can do the whole job? Yeah that does seem like an unfavorable idea, for banks and their puppeted policy makers.


I have a feeling that Morgan Stanley's hurdles and limitations for rolling out the bankchain are very different from the hurdles and limitations of the Bitcoin network. I think only one has issues that are insurmountable.

It's probably not that they really lack the insight. They're just trying to send the message that they *need* to send, for their own good.

My reason for amassing as many bitcoins as possible at any reasonable price remains the same: The system that the rest of the world uses is garbage and is not getting better.

Centralization and decentralization are like yin and yang, alright? Decentralization is expansion, centralization is consolidation, we require consolidation at this time, or Bitcoin is going to decentralize itself into a weakened state. Nothing is permanent, we can move back towards decentralization when the health of this system is not threatened.

Russian users will have to take on more risk and try to stay anonymous, or they could leave the country (which seems highly oppressive anyway). No one knows for sure yet how far the Russian government would go to actually track people down in order to enforce this, or how strict they will really be, because there are many many different types of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency users, will they put someone who bought bitcoin last year and is just holding it in jail? Will they throw them in jail only when they sell or move it? Or will it only be reserved for the bigger players who make a living trading crypto or something like that? Russia has quite a task on their hands to really enforce it. And of course anyone who is wise will know that it is entirely possible to just hide their identity while using crypto, people in Russia probably know how to do this more than most countries.

I think so as well, but unfortunately we're dealing with people who feel the need to try and preserve their old systems, and especially, their own power. The leaders of Russia, Vladimir Putin and his officials, have more power than you or I could imagine. They'll fight to maintain what they have, the good thing is that their ability to fight here is limited, their strategy is fear, and the people will not put up with fear forever, because ultimately it's an illusion. 
Throwing masses of people into prison because they decided to bypass a system that is literally holding them in poverty is ridiculous, it won't be good for Russia as a country if they actually follow through. What they should be focusing on is how to adapt, but that does not suit the personal interests of the leadership, or they are simply afraid of change. Many people living in poverty have nothing to lose anyway. In the long run, this would only generate hatred towards the Russian establishment, leading to more evasion and more civil disobedience. Especially when they feel the pain of what's to come throughout the global economy.
The power will slip out of their hands over time, you can be sure of that. Nothing is permanent, and the human race will progress with or without Putin's permission.

The performance of the network matters more than the halving. The halving will be amazing if, and only if, the bitcoin network is actually suitable to the majority of investors, and promises for the future may not cut it.

"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."
So Bitcoin in its early stages was highly decentralized, that set the stage, it made the environment fertile, it protected the fragile being that Bitcoin was (and it was more fragile than it is now, you can be sure of that). Decentralization gives us all the feeling that its a new frontier, as an example, the early United States. The United States utilized decentralization early on to allow itself to grow and overcome its issues in a very dangerous world. The operating emotion here is fear (of the unknown) but also excitement for the growth potential, and so naturally there will be overcompensation. Decentralization invigorates the people because decentralization creates an environment ideal for smaller operations to thrive, a lot gets done.
When a lot gets done, resources pile up, when resources pile up, all those smaller operations need to (or feel the need to) find ways to utilize all this surplus, and things become a bit reckless due the new operating emotion of greed, and the worry that things can't go well forever. And so, it leads to centralization. Not every small operation within the system can continue to churn out surplus, so competition ramps up, merging occurs, scarcity is perceived, efficiency becomes important, governance naturally becomes more strict and overreaching as a function of business interests and certain individuals accumulating massive wealth over time (and having to deal with massive feelings of greed and the paranoia that comes with it). The system consolidates itself, it becomes tighter, and easier to control by those who have the power to control it.
So Bitcoin isn't immune to this, its nature, doesn't matter what the code dictates, because there are further systems built on top, social systems that heavily involve the old human monkey mind hierarchy system. There's nothing wrong with this either, it's normal evolution. The United States continued to grow exponentially despite its shift from decentralization to centralization. It can take a long time before self destruction and real decay sets in, so long as the "arms" are ultimately centralized properly, usually through trial and error, so that existential threats can be dealt with, this space will be prosperous, so long as you understand how to operate within it.
Most of us here are mainly interested in profit, or other forms of self interest, that's totally normal, we all just need to understand that if we want to operate in this system, we have to go with the flow, position ourselves (and technically, even altcoins are linked to the Bitcoin system, it should be understood), and fight for the best outcomes we can. The ship WILL become harder to change course as it grows from a small boat to a titanic ship, and not everyone on it will have an equal place on the ship, and the ship can either reach its destination and many more, or crash into an iceberg and sink. That all depends on how the Bitcoin system can deal with the increasing pressure of existential threats as it rises on the pecking order.

I'm not saying we need to increase the block size, i'm saying we need to do whatever creates more growth, attention and value in the very near-mid future. It may even involve taking some kind of risk, but that's life. In my opinion we're not in a position to have an endless debate, maybe later when there is more support from the masses. Luckily we can make more changes in the future via consensus. My concern is in regards to other cryptocurrencies, and the state of the world economy right now.

Does it erase all the debt? If not then it would just be a glorified dollar database designed to fleece people more efficiently.
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:10:53
I think it definitely needs to scale. If the market feels the pressure people will get serious and make the right change, that's my prediction.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:33:28
They can't counterfeit Bitcoin, therefore they can't create centralized, massively powerful, corrupt institutions called banks. If they draw up regulations that are too strict for Bitcoin users, people will ignore and evade in ways not possible in a fiat system (in fiat banks conveniently enforce the strict regulations for everyone). 
They can regulate on the surface, but they can't take control of the monetary systems.

I mean as long as it's continuing to spread and grow it will go up in value for sure. When I say moon I mean moving parabolic like it has in the past, which is ultimately good for stability and will help people take it seriously.

Hahaha, wow, so they peg it to the value of the dollar. Doesn't change anything, not all the debt, not all the inequality. They can do this and then watch the dollar consistently lose value, effectively turning the US Dollar into a shitcoin.

Gold/silver may rise first because it's what ordinary people will take notice of if they need a safe haven. I think Bitcoin will rise too. Eventually people will mass migrate into *some* digital currency when things start to stabilize or when precious metals become too rare. No guarantee how that plays out.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:26:07
Yeah no question about that, 21 just guarantees a spot for the entire history of bitcoin, but the true amount for top 1 million is currently much less.
@_date: 2016-02-19 18:34:08
That problem starts to break down as the price begins to break down due to speculation of unresolved issues. People become flexible and accommodating once they're losing money.

Those aren't real money, they're not issued and fully controlled by a government.

Indeed! The working world is a miserable place for most people, and it needs to change. Whatever the kind of risk you and I are taking, it is better than being a mindless drone, I would prefer being homeless if it comes down to it. Long as I can maintain a car to sleep in, a gym membership to shower, basic necessities, a laptop, and some free wifi, I will continue to do my work. But for now, conditions will be fine :)

Congrats! My last day of working as an entry level test engineer is actually next friday :D B.S degree in computer science. I worked about 1 year and 8 months and raised enough money keeping expenses super low living on my own while trading btc, eth, making other investments, and starting a carpet cleaning business with a friend. I should have enough money to go on for over a year even if I make nothing. I plan to sharpen my trading skills, expand the business, and do some freelance software engineering in the crypto scene. Exciting times!

Anything that puts Bitcoin in people's consciousness is good news, in my opinion. It has already endured being banned, laughed at, slandered, etc. This adds to its legitimacy, if they try and regulate it too strictly I believe those regulations will be ignored/evaded.
