I don't find the necessity to waste my time replying to you, child.

My bank did the same thing.
I went to the branch and demanded a cash withdrawal, 5 digits in €.
They called the manager to tackle me, it was absurd and utterly illegal.
After what seemed to be forever, they let me go with approval to WD that amount from an ATM (can you imagine? From a fucking ATM?)
I felt horrible, however the funds are safe with me now and happy in my crypto handbag.
Needless to say - I had the rest of my funds and savings wired offshore.
This was a really bad wake up call.
I live in a dictatorship, and I am a fool for realising this so late.
Edit : the only reason I arrived at the branch for a cash withdrawal, was due to the bank aborting my pending wires, twice!
The buggers also refused talking on the phone with me. Suddenly I was a stranger to them, after being a cucky customer with them for years.
Shame on me.

Hi Big Jim, apart from this post and long phone calls, and the actual receipts for the transactions (which had invalid codes for no apparent reason), this is my documentation.
The events followed in this order :
I've arrived to the Centenario Mall at the city of Cali, Colombia.
I've attempted to withdraw from the ATM, received a verification code and completed the validation process.
Then waited for the confirmations (used a wallet via my smartphone).
Tried using the redeeming code (not sure how it's called in English).
Invalid code - ok time to phone the support line of Sarcoin.
At first I've spoken with a young man who was very kind and friendly, but didn't offer any solution apart from restarting the machine (meaning I've had to wait 30 minutes at the mall, with my partner and her kid. Needless to say, I've started getting uncomfortable).
After 30 minutes of strolling and having sandwiches, I've went again to the machine of Sarcoin.
Tried the code again.
It didn't work, again stating it's invalid.
Time to call the support line of Sarcoin.
Number unavailable!
For the next 30 minutes the number was not available.
By now I'm invested around 1.5 hours in order to withdraw a small amount of around 200$.
Called them plenty of times. 
This time a woman named Monica Cordano answers the call.
She was highly aggressive, cutting me off mid sentences, raising her voice - this is a support line, what is she doing? Who hired her?
Monica kept claiming that the code is invalid because I've placed my phone number incorrectly - however I've told her that's impossible since I've received the Verification Code to this exact mobile number!
She kept at it, blaming me for various faults with invalid arguments.
At the end I've insisted they resend a code to this same number, which she insisted is incorrect, but agreed to send.
Guess what, code arrived and worked.
How did dear Monica summarise the event?
'oh must've been a system malfunction..'
And hang up.
What the hell? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:43:29
The vast majority, yes.
At Colombia it's outrageously high, can get close to 20% with Athena.
Sad thing is the low liquidity, ATM barely has 500$.
This has happened with Sarcoin as well.
