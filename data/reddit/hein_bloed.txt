Is there any project which is about to implement this?

I would love to run a full node, but i have a 1tb quota per month. :(

I am not ... I think its a step forward in the right direction, you are right in the future we need this but more decentralized.

I laughed way to hard thank you

Since LN is like a PoS for bitcoin i think we will get a huge and well connected graph of payment channels quick. People can make money with fees when opening channels. So i think things will adopt much quicker.

Because its a sidechain. Noone forces you to use it.

Yes it does 2x forces you to use it. There is No chance to not use it. Rsk is a sidechain and optional for you. The main chain keeps being decentralized, while you have the ability to use rsk only if you want to.

Tbh we need to be able to deal with those spam attacks. Just imagin an attack from any gov in the future.
Once we have segwit and schnorr will we be able to deal with such things? Just asking

Thats also the way i am thinking about it.
Are there any bips or researches right now on how to compress the blockchain, or minimize the data so we dont need to store 10 TB of blockchain somedays?
If so is it also possible to compress the current existing blockchain more so not every node needs to store about 120gb of blockchain?
Are there any researches going in such a direction currently or is it easy to proof that this will never work?

I think you are right, with a "time-frame-to-pay" this isnt a problem

i am waiting for a official gentoo ebuild.

Of cause she will hold the coins, she is aware of the fact that not much people will pay with btc, but she wants to give the opportunity to do so.
She already has experience with btc and ownes some paper wallets.
I just thought the fluctuating price could be a problem for the customers.
Thank you for your help.

I also had in mind using a timeframe for the payers.
Are there any services online doing this work for me or do I have to write some scripts for that?
