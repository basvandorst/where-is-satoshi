The competition (BullionVault) comments:
 At 00.41am on a Saturday morning UK time (after Toronto trading closed on Friday evening) GoldMoney's recent trading history was quietly published by BitGold. It had to tell the stock-market what it had acquired. Those results made scary reading.
    GoldMoney's sales have collapsed – by 78.7% over three years.
    It lost £9.4 million in just one year – 2014.
    Its net assets fell from £25.4m in 2013 to £13.1m in 2015.
    At its March 2015 year-end it is still posting losses.

Downloading isn't usually the slowest part.
 Your machine has to validate all the blocks, which for me was the slowest part.

I think this would open up the OP to a replay attack on his original "real" bitcoin balance, since this tx could then be replayed on the original bitcoin network ???....
