Yes, no, maybe! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:20:53
Good guess lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:32
Don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:08
Very cheap lesson! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:33:23
Are you trying to make a profit? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:03:30
I definitely don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:22:48
Definitely cool! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:52:37
Localbitcoins works well. Might have to do a few transactions to get up to 21BTC though.

How does this statement confirm anything? I'm sure he just read the same thing as anyone else.

It's definitely more complicated but i agree. Bitcoin screams intelligence. If you cant beat them join them. Go Bitcoin!

Definition of shit post.

Let's be honest, are you really going to give up USD? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:08:22
Ponzi proof! Woohoo! haha
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:14:45
Take your time and do a lot of research. Don't let emotions get the best of you. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:52:27
Look up cold storage. It's possible to do this with electrum. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:55:02
Wow! How could I not invest in this? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:46:38
Edited the post, good call! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:23:49
You don't need to buy a trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:13:16
Welcome to the second Matrix haha
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:21:50
Check out localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:54:20
Nice job! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:23:56

I'm not a fan of ETH. LTC can be useful as a test net for BTC. 
BTC wins like always. 
Just do the research yourself and see if you support them. If you do, you will buy them.

Initial Coin Offering
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:45:00
Just start buying some every month. You don't need to put $5000 in right away. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:32:59
I completely agree with you. Try your best to discern scams as well, almost all alt coins are scams. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:56:20
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:01:14
I'm not disagreeing with you. I don't think everyone should delete their account. Just decided it wasn't for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:24:19
The benefit is you don't need to buy a Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:21:27
Nope, just want to support local transactions. I like the idea of decentralized exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:24:44
Kind of. I would almost go as far as to say all cryptocurrencies are a ponzi scheme haha
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:11:41
In my opinion, the only alt coin worth a damn is Monero. Just my opinion, but the tech is solid. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:09:59
Many reasons, but mainly that their tokens are used with most ICO's. Most ICO's are scams.
