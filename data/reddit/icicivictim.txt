Merchants who integrate BitPay, get credited directly to their bank account by BitPay Inc. Who'll credit merchant's bank account, if they integrate BTCPay?

If BTCPay does not provide an option for USD conversion, then it is neither an alternative of BitPay nor bringing in anything new. There are many API providers who allow to accept bitcoin directly with a few lines of code.

BitPay converts BTC to USD using their internal exchange as per this rate -  This means, customer pays in BTC, merchant receives USD. I wonder, if BTCPay offers the same and if yes, from whom USD will be credited to merchant's bank account?

1 BCC = 0.12 BTC on Bittrex.
Therefore, 1 BTC held Since July 31, 2017 = 5101 USD.
