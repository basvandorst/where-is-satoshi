I've been there once. It's a lesson every newbie has to learn.

Only using Paypal for Ebay until I use up all my Ebay GCs. Yea. Paypal is actually REQUIRED to use an Ebay GC. WTF.

Thanks. I'll have to wait it out and see if things fix themselves. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:26
Yea. People need to know that before buying Ebay gift cards.

Does gemini accept credit card payments? If so, coinbase is gonna see my dust.

You mean Bcash? Don't even let them ride the bitcoin name.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:21:21
What's a good place to sell BCH once this happens? Might as well set up the account now.

A credit card could be useful in that instance. Use a CC to pay the vet bill first. Sell the btc needed to cover the bill. Takes about a week to get that cash and then pay off the CC bill. If you have a rewards CC, even better.

Bless the people behind this bill. Please let it go through.

It's ok, bro. I bought when it was close to 5k. ✌

I love OPs who credit the original poster. So rare these days.

I bought a majority at around 4,700 and then a bit more at 4,100. It's still dipping. I bought at 1k before and sold at 2k during the august crash. Had I not panic sold, I'd have at least a half year worth of mortgage payments covered. Never selling again unless I need money.
Now I hold.

That's beautiful, man. I don't usually appreciate art but that I love.
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:38:36
Glad you hesitated and didn't get scammed.

I bought near 5k. Got the worse timing but definitely won't consider selling lower than I bought.
