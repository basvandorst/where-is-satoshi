Paying $10 on a $200 purchase doesn't bother me that bad.

The man misses the point on a lot of things. But whether he's doing it on purpose is up in the air. I'm pretty sure he's doing it on purpose.

On the first point, I was reading this like "Holy shit! I need to go learn some stuff. I just keep my shit on electrum with the seed written on paper in a safe buried in my back yard!"

Hate to be that guy, but this isn't an Easter Egg.

If this is true then the entire Saints Row franchise, all media and background of GTA, and half the item discriptions and dialogue of The Witcher are all just "Easter Eggs"
  
  
Back in my day, Easter Eggs were something youd have to basically accidentally find by forgetting the controlls after a while and accidentally running through a wall with no collision mesh because you pressed the wrong direction, and then wall and then watch a video or see a joke.
  
  
Possibly, even, finding a random item in a barrel and finding a random NPC that would do something with it.
  
  
Or, at least, using a cheat code to fly somewhere and be told "There are no Easter eggs, go away."
  
  
Pretty sure I found cryptocurrency drives often in Far Cry 4, I just finished it. This isn't hard enough to find, like a child's Easter egg.

 HODLS

The first time I've bought once the price upticked instead of panic selling.
I'm ready for my HODL4life tattoo.

More like the perception of U.S. debt is a fraud.

Yeah about when should I try and cash out? I have some coins stuck in transfer that I guess I'll get and profit off of, but also my coinbase account I threw $100 in and made $12 last night lol

I wish I cared enough about BCH to know it hit 3500 so I could offload the little bit I had.
