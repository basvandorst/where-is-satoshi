They do. Just that the sender creates the invoice encrypts it and sends it to the recipient. The recipient still needs to acknowledge it to receive the funds.

Would have been interesting if they tried it.

I guess I was suggesting that they could collude and agree to split the reward as a way to get enough hash power on board. You never need more than 51% either.. just takes longer.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:59:39
Indeed - it would be nice to have more.

I don't remember mtgox taking cc at all. It must have been very early and short-lived.. like maybe the first hundred customers or something. I'm also thinking it was just PayPal for cc too?

Yea except he spent 100000 not just the 10000 on two pizzas.

Maybe.  Maybe not.. only one way to find out. I suspect the outrage would fade and the price recover. I do think it's quite bad that pools have the ability to make these decisions. We should move to a system where all miners compose their own blocks instead of slaving to the pool. I don't think it's particularly helpful to pretend that it isn't in the pools interest to abuse their power when it might well be sometimes.

Very little chance at this point imo.. be careful of people offering to help - they're quite likely to be scammers.

Ok, but even in that case it would make sense to force them to do it.. they may be able to keep some of the funds due to the miners invested in the current chain but they still get punished a bit.

They need to reveal the preimage from the invoice to their channel partner. If they don't then their channel partner can't claim the funds from their channel partner. It may be the case that your wallet does this automatically without asking but that's just a ui issue.

Maybe.. I'm guessing it'll be optional for the seller so might not be available a lot of the time..

From the interview; "In all, he estimated that he spent 100,000 Bitcoin on a number of items, much of it on pizza."

Couldn't be LN - you have to give the sender an invoice so she wouldn't have been able to forcefully send it to him. Even if you assume she used an unsolicited ln payment his node would have to accept it.

Probably a bunch of withdrawals from different accounts that got batched together into one tx.. probably they all happened at more or less the same time though.

Tbh I doubt very much that you'll be able to do this. Exchanges in China probably won't give you an account unless you are legally resident there.. it would probably also be necessary for you to have a bank account there to receive the RMB - which you would also not be able to get as a non-resident. You could probably pay someone to setup a Chinese company that would hold both a Chinese bank account and a bitcoin exchange account but I'm guessing the cost of setting all that up far exceeds the 18% tax you are trying to avoid. The other solution would be to find a Chinese partner to handle it for you, or get your supplier to directly accept BTC.

The bitstamp fee is only for cc

Three pool operators can't agree to split 7000 BTC? I dunno..
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:34:21
Probably in the future everyone's phones will all have a chip entangled with everyone else's chip.

Probably not as most bitcoins are owned by Americans so BTC would likely track the USD higher vs other currencies.

Is your HK gf resident in the us? If she's in HK I guess the IRS doesn't care what she does with your money.. if she's us resident then it won't be any different than you doing it.

Surely if the attacker is forced to spend the 7000 defending their hack it's still mission accomplished - they don't benefit from the hack anymore.

Uh huh..
