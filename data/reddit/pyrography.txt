It's not going to rise like it did in the bubble. It's going to stagnate after the crash. Buying now is beyond stupid, you're trying to predict a bull trap on a whim.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:54:39
The bull trap has been and gone. It would be rare for there to be another one mid crash.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:04:06
Limited testing for something that won't even be adopted by the majority of the community and has been in dev for years. Yeah, you're seeing things.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:36:41
As a tech bitcoin is severely flawed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:13:22
I already predicted this crash after the bull trap following the dip after the peak. Completely standard bubble behaviour.
Map it against the tulip price crash and it's almost identical. The only question is where it bottoms and no that can't be predicted accurately. What I can and did predict is that the party is over for bitcoin.

That isn't a metric thing. The metric system uses decimals correctly (to mark the point between whole and part numbers) and commas are used only for ease of reading long numbers.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:35:41
You're 100% correct.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:19:39
Good chat.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:04:58
Long term it's the opposite. It has no long term viability.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:59:17
High fees and long transaction times. It's useless as a currency and not a good store of wealth.
It's only good for speculative investing and at the moment with it crashing you will want to hold off.

Imperial system has been surpassed. Anyone using it has been poorly educated.
It would be like teaching someone to use Windows 95.

I dont think you do. You wrote $100.000 which is one hundred dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:39:42
Most people only bought in the last 3-4 months.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:07:41
They are trying to time the market during a bubble pop. It's impossible to do and the most likely scenario is you losing money. 
Best case scenario you make a few % gains in 2 years or so.
It's not recovering from this crash any time soon.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:24:13
It's going to drop to around 5-6k and stabilize there. Buying now is just catching a falling knife.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:06:38
It's not money, it's not a useable currency at all currently. Multi-day transaction time with ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:05:50
Standard market behaviour. Look at any bubble pop graph. Falls to the long term average. 5k might even be generous given that no one considers bitcoin a functional currency or store of wealth anymore.
Could drop to 1-2k and then enter a slow decline.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:46:32
It's hilarious reading the comments from people here who have no idea about investing. Buying now is the literal worst time to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:02:55
End of financial year is March though...
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:07
It'll probably go below that and there won't be a rebound. Every casual investor just got spooked out of the market so prices will stagnate for a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:28:42
That won't help you in a bubble Lol, you'll just get fucked both ways.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:22
By being educated about investing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:46:26
It's a speculative bubble based on a commodity with no intrinsic value. The bubble already popped and it's in a bear trap currently. In a year it will be dead.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:29:25
The huge bubble that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:52:57
Weird way to do it imo. Financial year here, and in most of the world outside the US is not the calendar year. 
Why have it end when everyone is on holiday??
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:41:08
Bull trap has been and gone, this is the crash that will bottom out around the long term average line. About 5-6k at a guess.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:34:27
There hasn't been a bubble like this. It's exponentially larger than 2014
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:42:30
That might be the dumbest way of looking at it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:14:39
Those countries are objectively wrong. The only place I've seen that incorrect usage being widespread is Brazil.. probably not an ideal model of education lol.
You can't just choose how to use a mathematical symbol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:37:47
Haha there's no chance of that happening. The crash will bottom out around 5k and the price will stagnate there due to casual investors being scared off and all the horror stories coming to light. Bitcoin has peaked and now it's dying.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:53:41
The bulk run has been. Usually only one in a bubble pop. Look at the price graph, peak, dip, bull run, crash.
Standard bubble behaviour. Maps almost perfectly on to something like the tulip bubble.
It's possible there will be another but it will be pretty muted. No one is investing significant money right now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:19:25
It'll keep falling to long term average line around 5k then probably slowly decline as it's no good as a currency and no longer a good investment now the bubble is over. Eventually it'll die off.
Invest in coins that have the potential for practical use.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:53:38
RemindMe! 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:26:59
Look at long term averages. Bottom will be around $5k.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:47:45
A smart investor wouldn't hold the majority of their wealth in a super speculative market. Moving it in to real estate is a safe, smart move and when it's time to retire he can sell the property and downsize or move to a tropical location.

It's entirely caused by China clamping down of capital outflow so Chinese are using it to circumvent their currency laws.
