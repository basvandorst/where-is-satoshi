How come the largest investors in Kraken come from Japan? 
Sure, Japanese are famous for planning ahead and being very innovative, but I would think California-based VCs or European 'smart-money' would be more likely contributors to an advancing start-up.

This post seems to be attracting butt-hurt users and trolls like honey-pot. Oh, and what's this, a double-post?
I used Kraken for close to 3 years now and have been a strong advocate of it the whole time. They are *the most honest* exchange there is. When they have issues - they talk about it, when something breaks - they notify, when clients ask for something - they listen.
That's why a lot of pro-traders use them. The other side of having pro-traders on the exchange is that you will be running against bots that have been carefully calibrated and tailored to Kraken. Hence, they have a better feel for order book and can act quicker. From the looks of it, this is what happened in your case.
If you want to be better at trading, use their API. Or at least consult other sites that did the work for you:
Or, if you want to run against ignorant noobs and conspiracy theorists, go trade on Bittrex.

Are you sure you have provided all the info they requested? I know they sometimes have to ask for additional documents for large USD transfers within EU.
I doubt they are short on cash with all this volume they've been doing.
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:02:39
That's because Kraken is fully integrated with Fidor. Still, conventional SEPA transfers take 1 business days to get processed (for most banks), and even sometimes arrive on the same business day!
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:13:58
Ah, so it IS a USD transfer - just what I thought.
So here's what's up: currently, Kraken has a USD payment processor for EU - PayCash ( - who are regulated by appropriate authorities and fully compliant. The downside of that is they very often request source of funds document for transfers over 15k USD/GBP, which Kraken is forced to request from their clients.
Hence, I encourage you to realize that this isn't technically Kraken's fault, and you're much better off just providing that document (income statement, bank statement, stock sale receipt, etc.), unless of course if you're a criminal laundering money.
Moral of the story is: use EUR wires/SEPA for Kraken deposits.

You seem to be substituting concepts here: how are exchanges to blame for declining prices? - Because they allow users like yourself to sell at market prices?
Would you rather have them 'ban' selling, like Chinese did with their stocks? Or have exchanges buy all those coins for themselves?
Exchanges are just mediums. Miners, on the other hand...

Hello there and welcome to an exciting world of bitcoin trading!
To answer your questions:
1. Kraken is the best for Europe: free and very fast funding, top-notch security (never been hacked), advanced trading features, 5x margin, 24/7 customer support, very friendly UI;
2. not nessesarily, I keep most of my coins on Kraken. And have a few on phone (blockchain wallet) to spend;
3. copay.io seems Ok, but I haven't used them, since blockchain wallet does fine for me.
Feel free to ping anytime if you have questions. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:07:44
Filed my claim alright - thank you, Kraken!
May come helpful to some: somehow, your normal gox login password is different from your claim password. When resetting a password, code came to email I used to sign-up with Kraken. It took about 15 minutes, though.

Congrats on making the move and welcome to Bitcoin!
Re: Kraken - best exchange there is, have been with them for over 1.5 years (after having tried Btc-e, Bitstamp, etc.). Kraken's UI is very good, offers advanced orders, margin trading, among other things. SEPA transfers are very fast and FREE (0 for deposits, 9 cents for withdrawal). They have an excellent customer service, also 24/7 live chat I believe.
Re: Wallet - Kraken has a very tight security (in 4 years never been hacked), so I just keep my bitcoins with them.
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:24:00
Forgot to mention (maybe will come useful to someone): when filing a MtGox claim through Kraken, they automatically credit your account with $1000 fee credits, which basically means you can trade about $500 000 volume for free. Nice perk, IMO.

When I initially signed up, it took me 10 minutes to set up account (&amp; verify it), deposit arrived the next day and I purchased bitcoins instantly. So it's not that big of a hassle. Besides, you might need more bitcoins in future.

Hey, sorry to hear about your trouble. I've been using Kraken for about 2 years now, never had a single issue with them. Which is why it is especially strange to hear about something like this happening.
Are you sure they didn't do this for a reason? I mean, there has to be some sort of explanation for it.

I see your point. However, I meant "expensive" = overpriced. Currently, the larger portion of BTC price is determined by **speculative** supply/demand. When the price determinants shift into area of the actual value BTC brings (i.e. serving a certain % of global trade), we'll see some real price movements.

Use Kraken, they are the most resilient and user-friendly exchange.

Apparently they are scared of bitcoin. I heard Raiffeisen did the same early this year, but they eased up lately, albeit asking their customers for confirmations for bitcoin-related deposits.
My advice: try a more bitcoin-friendly bank. Fidor Bank is the best one:  - they are fully integrated with Kraken, deposits/withdrawals take 10 minutes!
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:07:41
Let me guess, is your bank: Caisse d'Epargne?
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:51:32
It's a lot simpler and more straightforward than the rest of exchanges I tried:
1. sign up and fill in your name / phone #
2. wire some $$ (takes 1-2 business days, depending on your bank)
3. buy BTC
Costs are 0.003-0.001% fee for a trade and from 0.01 EUR/USD for SEPA withdrawal. Not sure about the Wire transfer, since I am based in EU. Mind you, Kraken is a San Francisco-based company.
EDIT: bitcoin withdrawal fee is 0.00050
