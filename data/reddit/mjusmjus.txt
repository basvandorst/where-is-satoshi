Listening to this guy screech is awful. Maybe if he calmed down and talked like a reasonable human he would actually get some views.

Yes it did, Bitstamp has been running since 2011.

Agreed, we all know BU, XT and Classic are shit.

Fuck me, sell all your bitcoins before $0 NOW !!!

Is GUIminer still around? 
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:34:24
Of course it is, divide and conquer just like XT and classic.

It's always a good time to buy bitcoin

Why anyone would listen to this dufus is beyond me. He has done nothing for bitcoin, everything he does is for his own gain. He is up there with mtgox and the BFL crew.

Funny, you could replace crypto owners with metal owners.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:16:40
His whole persona is 'The first bitcoin investor', and that video backs him up as a relevant person when mtgox was around, which will be looked at as the genesis period of bitcoin in the future. He values his persona more than his moral character apparently.

I guess the precedence it sets is dangerous enough.

For people outside the US, will this have any effect?

yup. Money is nothing compared to the recognition and respect you get from your peers, or lack of.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:28:17
How sad and depressing it must be working on a project with no public interest and no future.

more like you are a bank and receives 1 BTC in deposit and lend out 9, that's how they do it with fiat, how would that work with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:51:13


That's rich. 
Well excuse me your highness, I wont bother you anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:37:42
easy, watch, I will sell all my coins now, around 15 min after that we will be passed 5k.

So, your 'we' are going to do the same thing over and over and expect a different result?
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:46:59
I am 99% sure this is not your first experience with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:13:40
Ditto, I still play it sometimes. I have still not beaten the game with an amazon. Shit, the nostalgia is creeping in now.

Namecoin is the only other coin I have faith in. But it is not comparable to Bitcoin since it does not try to be money.
