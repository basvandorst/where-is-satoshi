...and you are partly to blame for throwing a temper tantrum over spilled milk, knowing full well the history of milk, cups, and gravity.
It isn't victim blaming.  Everyone with significant funds vested there deserves to let off some steam, however the behavior surrounding this particular hack I find puzzling.  I had BTC there, too.  There is no excuse for not diversifying the location of your coins for protection.  There is no excuse for them allowing this to happen.
You literally created a Reddit account to vent.  Fine.  Just stop with fanning the emotional flames, okay?

Oh - I may have made an error then.  It has been at least 5 years since I've had to do it, so "old version" might be my M.O.

You realize that password protection on a zip file is easily broken, right?  If you need help, let me know.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:32:06
Not in a position to look right now, but a little googling will turn up what you need.  I've broken zip file encryption multiple times throughout the years when the password on a file was not to be found.  It isn't particularly difficult.

Uh...except there is literally no reason for "ljr" to exist.

Gotta start somewhere....right?

Which will become increasingly more difficult to get, using more and more electricity and cpu cycles to mine.

Yup.  Let's ban tornadoes.

Just don't do it?  :P
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:13:11
Well - that's kinda my question.
Let's say I had access to 1u or 2u of rackspace in a climate-controlled data center.  2u to give you room to play.
Just asking for argument's sake.  I know I could get 2u for $140/mo at one point.
What would be the best hardware use for that space today?
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:09:17
So yeah.  You hipster.  You used IE before it was cool.

Not really - I apologize.
I was trying to find a way of phrasing it in less subjective terms.  :\
I've seen some really scary looking rigs - there was a site full of pictures I've since forgotten.
This question can be REALLY subjective, so I thought I could narrow the scope by fixing the cost of cooling and power.  Bleh.  See what I'm getting at though?  It's not so much "what's right for me", it's "at what scale does this make sense"?

Just for the sake of clarity...
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:47:57
Well hello there!
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:54:56
I'd give you crap about not looking me up around here, but I see you only just arrived.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:24:38
So...waitasec.  If you sell Bitcoin via amazon, the buyer can pay with a credit card?
That....almost seems reasonable until someone runs a chargeback claiming they never got their coin.

At $900 I'd give it a shot too.  What could go wrong?  :P
