Hey could you enlighten me? I'm a newbie and recently bought my first 600€ at the 15th sold again at 3300€ and was planning to buy again when it was around €3000 but bitcoin seems to get only higher. I have €2k left now to invest should I wait or buy?

But people dont like the segwit2x coins right thats why they want to leave coinbase? sorry if its a stupid question

So if i dont use bitcoin but another wallet and buy bic there is a chance you get bitcoin segwit2x for free? Atleast if i understand right. which site would you recommend besides coinbase?

Allright I'll maybe take a guess and put it in bic but I heard coinbase isn't the right place cuz I would get 2x coins?

Alt coins are like ETH and litecoin? I'll maybe take a guess at those, thanks for the answer though.

Oeh thanks man, I'll look into that wallet today, could you explain what the segwit and hardfork are, in simple language? You seem to know your shot and you're pretty clear for my noobmind. Also someone mentioned NEO, worth looking into?

Allright thanks very much, will 2x cause a dip or a rise, otherwise I wait a bit with investing.
