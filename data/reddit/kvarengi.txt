China controls Bitcoin already i bet. They got 80% of volumes and 70% of hashing power.

Patrick Byrne: "I started out in online sales in 1999 ... we were doing something as revolutionary as the people who were printing the Gutenberg Bible were. I get that same feeling when I think about Bitcoin and crypto."

It is awesome for running international business. We receive  salaries and bonuses in BTC. Automatically distributed payroll between members of the team.

speculators on BTC are quickly replaced with real businesses  in crypto. This reminds the dot com situation, but 5 times faster

Dont forget - this bubble is coming from far higher price and far higher volumes. It gen get up to 10 000 and than drop to 500. But not lower than it was at the beginning

if you are an early adopter - you already got your portion of rally profit in 2013. Let other guys to ride it now. It is the guarantee of the fact, that the price will hold on levels which the majority of buyers would enter long positions.
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:54:32
Exactly. All the happenings around bitcoin do slightly change people's paradigm of how economic works. They are getting ready to understand how to use Btc drop by drop.

wow cool! We in CoinTelegraph happy to hear that!

Everything "patented" is not revolution. Its an evolution part. I want this evolution to be the blitzkrieg.

Its the biggest-ever bitcoin trading volumes on Huobi

i love this guy) Really waiting for Kim to run decentralized drive sharing tool.

Or to dump. Someone is always really trying to manipulate the price, if you are huge investor in Bitcoin as Winklevoss or mining company like Bitfury you will try not only to pump in comments, but also make some government lobby, reach out press, meet right people. Thats because you want your assets to be liquid and valuable. If you want to dump - than you are a buyer. Both cases are useful for the industry. Good when something goes on.
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:57:43
Forget about coupon - its just "grizzly marketing") The case itself is amazing!

Yesterday we heard good news from China, now - from Europe. A month ago from Russia we discovered that the Central Bank director owns some Bitcoins. US, come on, do you still need this freacking bit-licence??? Obama, its your move. Tell everyone that you are early adopter and show us your GPU miner since 2010th... 
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:57:59
Get hard, pals. The bigger bitcoin influence - the bigger bounties for hackers. We should just get through it. Its like teenage acne on young and beautiful bitcoin face ;)
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:31:51
Wrong case. It is not zero-cost on Huobi. You need to pay for transactions. I can see real buyers on the market.
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:51:42
The best thing is this Video - that they explained how Bitcoin works for the masses. Good Job, guys!

At last someone discovered - adopting bitcoin in the region causes huge economic growth. I bet it should be a trend now. Bitcoin is liquid all around the world - the easier bitcoin usage in local region - the more Bitcoin users from all the world would use it there.
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:17:04
Someday if you would turn off bitcoin payments - you would loose 80% of customers. I think we get there quick.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:27:23
So - HFT volumes are fake now? On classic exchanges (f/ex NYSE) more than 50% of volumes are made by HFT algorithms

Good job, CT. More of daily fraud investigations, please!

 Its a joke? 1st of april only in 20 days... Crypto-news dedicated website trying to sell bullshit stuff for dollars? The summary here is "we don't care about Bitcoin, give us real money, we will contribute more fairy tails for you"...
