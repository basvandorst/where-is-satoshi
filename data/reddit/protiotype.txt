Forgetting about the scale, what I've found scarier are the constant all time highs from the US markets for the past year. Up and up and up. Every few days. It's not right.

Shower thoughts are just thoughts that come from a relaxed meditative state.

I hope we get a "correction" so you can come in.

I was actually referring to the other thing that holds a lot more value going up and up and not feeling right... (edit: dow jones, nasdaq etc)
If bitcoin somehow crashed to 10%  next month, the world wouldn't be fucked.

I don't understand it, but got given it. Learned a little about it. Then accepted a little more. Then learned some more again. And again with all the recent milestones.
I still don't understand it all but am okay with that. I don't fully understand the economy either, but have money in the bank, etc.

What about 21.098k?

It's not really deep thinking. I believe it's like meditation or "mindfulness", which isn't about no-thinking either. You don't fight to push thoughts out or keep them in - they just happen if they happen.
Going for a familiar bike ride, jog, shower, or even washing the dishes or getting "in the zone" when practising a musical instrument and all of those states will feel similar, where thoughts are allowed to wander without stress.
It's a bit like the moments your mind starts to wander and dream (or daydream) as you start to fall asleep without actually falling away too far.
Don't try to think in the shower, but don't try to not think either.

Not even a mention of tulips! Maybe the next instalment will predict that bitcoin will get to tulips level of dominance? Here's hoping!

Everything is memes. Richard Dawkins made it so.

I don't see it a lot; most people seem to be too much "go go go" all the time. Too much coffee, too much alcohol, too much everything.

Bubbles that burst affect the economy drastically (tulips, dot com, junk bonds, etc). Assume bitcoin is a bubble and bursts tomorrow to next week: what will happen?

But it's not - if anything, it's living in a daydream state.

"That's stupid"

Actually, I feel that most people don't want to talk about either.

As far as I can tell, it's all still pretty experimental and hardly past the testing phase:

I haven't checked if Uber is actually the biggest taxi company in the world - if they are, they might also be the "taxi company" [losing]( the most money in the world.

Where did speculate this out of? I was keeping an eye on new smartphones all of last year and not once did I come across any 3D scanning rumours. I managed to buy the Google Pixel though. It's pretty good.

If ever a few ^\[citation ^needed\] tags were needed (about current "facts"), it is in Goldman's Facebook post.

The Kodak story isn't quite as straightforward as he makes it out to be:
