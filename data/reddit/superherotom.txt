It's not, I'm considering accepting cryptocurrency, but there is a little bit of a self defeating cycle going on, which 'm hoping more cryptocurrency themed merchandise will resolve.
Two reasons for not accepting fiat so far:
1: I'm hoping to involve people who do not invest in fit of any kind. Checkout is already a HUGE obstacle for a web venue, and I would probably be wiser to wait until I have some kind of brand awareness to chance confusing people who may already be suspicious of crypto-anything.
2: Accepting fiat excludes me form some very powerful marketing options. Facebook has denied half of my ads due to the wording , at least in their opinion, making it appear like I accept or use cryptocurrency. I have to constantly re-work my facebook ads, and even it-themes sub reddits have rules about how you word payment stuff. Which is kind of self defeating, but I get it and think we can overcome it given time.

No problem! If you buy a mug you'll be my first customer! Lol

Thanks for your response! The most common question I hear from people who don't know much about crypto currency is: "isn't that stuff used for criminal purchases?" Which I acknowledge and then point out that cash, paper currency is also used for criminal purchases, but we all invest in paper currency. I'd be glad to look up a few articles for you, but for evidence you can always punch "arguments against crypto currency" into the ole google. The idea is to put consumer fear into context and dismiss it, which is a great way to market.

Thanks for pointing this out! I didn't realize this was a person's name from how I have heard it used. I'm going to remove that mug until I have permission from Lord Ashdrake, if he is kind enough to grant it. Thanks again!
