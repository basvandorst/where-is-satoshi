I would really like to see this question answered by the dev BTC contributors. I too believe that more ASIC resistant, GPU/CPU miners and pools all around the world would increase the hash power, make it more decentralized, more stable (china miner fud) and the transaction times + fess would be lowered.

My biggest regret in 2017 is that I didn't buy more in the beginning in the 2017. I am buying now in this dip so that I won't have this regret in 2018. HODL mode: activated.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:29:21
Reading about the Japanese adoption and Godlman Sachs opening Bitcoin trading desks. I know the felling.
My first price correction in 2017 was fear, oh no this might not recover, but afterwards it always went higher. And I also understand that fear when you do not invest in the bottom, thinking naaah it will go lower, but then it never did.
I said in june, there is no way we will see 10k till march 2018. And I had to adjust my words to say that we might see 30k till march and more in the end of next year. The tech is new and the best recipe for investment in this market was to hold your position and do not sell untill you really need it.

@_date: 2017-12-26 08:23:53
Segwit is a BTC softfork with a goal of reducing transaction times and to lowe fees.
If you plan to hold longterm BTC no problem, if you plan to trade (specially on weak icos), please educate yourself, because your starting point is weak and there are lots of experienced greedy wolfs out there.

After 45% correction this is an ideal jumping point for another upward movement. The bottom levels were tested and the weak traders were flushed out in a week time. Your 1. assessment also goes for European markets.

Decentralization is what we need. This is why on the long run BTC will win. Nobody wants couple of businesses to control the coin price, which is BCH.

Mr. 200BTC. I see how you are bad at managing your money. Why would you mortgage a house with the amount that you have? You would be paying more than if you cash it at once. IF you are not sure, wait and take your time to think. Develop your own decisions, take your time since this is serious stuff. Basically you are mixing emotions with logic - bad. If you know your wife, you already know the answer why you didn't tell her - let's be real here. Do you understand her or are you afraid of confrontation - if you have this fear then there are other things behind it. Talk to a professional who doesn't know you personally. First solve your limitations and thinking, then move to yout concerns.
My personal advice. No one in your relationship should leave your jobs because of your luck. If this should be a discussion in a relationship, then I am sorry for the kid. Luck has a way of changing fast.

You mean the BTC price increase by 100x? If yes, there is a tendency to increase the electricity consumption since more people see mining as profitable but I wouldn't assume that the increase is linearly correlated. The energy consumption by itself is not the problem. The main issue that needs fixing is the dirty coal burning that is used in some countries. This website has some nice infographics regarding electricity consumption, but some of the comparisons are shallow estimates from not so credible sources: [
I would be more worried, why I am still holding on to an old combustion driven car that burns dead dinosaurs. We need to switch to clean energy ASAP.
