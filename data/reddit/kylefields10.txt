I made the same switch a month ago. Couldn't be happier about the switch.

This is the best news I've heard today.  You do this and I can finally start accepting my paycheck in bitcoins.  I want!

I think it's a sweet currency that works better than the Federal Reserve.  The economic system seems to be systematically breaking down.  Good stuff tends to stick around, bad stuff tends to die off.  It has nothing about "the secret" bullshit.  It has to do with the fact that it just works better.

Can't we all just concede that none of us KNOW whether bitcoin is a bubble or not.  Either outcomes are in the realm of possibility and anyone who says they KNOW the future of bitcoin is lying to you.  So let's all share our viewpoint constructively so we can all hear as many viewpoints as possible and make as well informed decisions as possible.

The thing this guy completely misses is that it would auto correct our out of control debt and consumption problem.  We buy way too much shit, and the result of that is waste and pollution.  If bitcoin we're adopted as a currency, it would likely have a deflationary effect.  This means that your bitcoin tomorrow is worth more than your bitcoin today.  This creates an incentive to save money and spend it on quality items that will last longer.  It makes food, clothing and shelter cheaper and more readily available to those with lower incomes.  It also reduces debts that are currently due in dollars as the dollar would become overinflated as a currency.  Imagine a world where everyone would be able to pay off their debts and live comfortably with low prices and high quality goods.  Earning bitcoins by turing their computer on.  Doesn't sound so bad to me.

Because I have more faith in other people like me than I do any corporation or government.
