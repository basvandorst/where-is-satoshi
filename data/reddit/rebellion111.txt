Whatever "miner" you tried using is either A. not doing shit and they are trying to phish you or B. They are using your GPU to mine alt coins and scamming you.
It could be something else but GPU mining has been long dead, like years dead. I recommend you do a significant amount more research before you try to mine cryptos again.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:46:00
Don't be too worried about it, just make sure you aren't compromised. 
I would encourage you to continue your curiosity in crypto mining. Be patient, learn about it and then jump into mining a coin that you are interested in. It would help to find a coin that can be profitable to mine or in the future might have some value so you don't feel like it's just a waste.

This guy is a piece of shit but everyone needs to realize that, to Roger, Bitcoin Cash *is* Bitcoin. It's Roger's Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash *is not* Bitcoin *to us*, but it is to him. No one owns the name Bitcoin.

The only people confused are you Bitcoin fanatics (don't get me wrong, you guys help us progress) that want specific names for the fractions of bitcoins. The kids playing MC are not going to care or pay attention to what you guys say a Bit really is. We really shouldn't get on the ship that uses the name Bits to figure out measurements. It is not descriptive in any way. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:49:41
He's saying they thought "bits" was better for the NAME in game. You're only confused because you chose to give names to fractions of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:36:29
Bit or satoshis in no way describe a unit of Bitcoin. mBits at least have some measurement adjective to the name. Doesn't matter who came up with Bits or satoshis, the point is that they are confusing and not well known terms in relation to exact measurements of Bitcoin. Therefore you can use the names however you damn well please because they are generic and undefined. 
Anyways, I like that Bits is the in game name for the currency. It's simple and catchy. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:45:04
I made a new crypto and named the smallest increment "Money!". Can you figure out how many zeroes I placed behind the decimal to come up with the name "Money!"? 
Send your kids my way and I'll explain why the name Bits was better for an in-game currency linked with bitcoin than an actual increment of bitcoin.

He doesn't claim to be right? He updates the charts so people can see if there is (or is not) a correlation between stability and price. So far from the data, it's not that the price raises significantly, but that the price *moves* significantly after a peak in stability. Not everything is for predicting "the next bubble".

Am I missing something here? Why in the fuck do you need a million dollar Internet forum? Is there going to be free video conferencing and fucking 3d coffee printer or what? Why did the r/Bitcoin community decide they wanted a new fucking forum? Seems like a huge waste of funds, regardless of where they came from.

Good read my friend. And I agree. I think people just dive way too far into the philosophy of Bitcoin and end up way the fuck in the deep end, drowning. It brings up great discussion, especially with passionate readers, and the discussion is important so people like me can think and learn about Bitcoin. So thank you @_date: 2014-05-03 06:34:28

I would be excited if USAA started doing things like that. I wish some of these financial service companies start taking advantage of bitcoin; like coming up with a BitCard that I can put in my wallet or whatever. Add a camera to scan QR codes and something to put in password/amount and show applicable information. Hell you could even add in wifi/bluetooth capability and make the battery replaceable. I don't want to have to rely on my phone necessarily to be my bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 10:10:38
You have to remember that they are a **bank**. Bitcoin is suppose to let users be their own bank. USAA isn't in the business of creating wallets or bitcoin services, although they may join in time. They earn money off credit cards, loans, and other banking fees. They are trying to use the blockchain technology internally to save money on their own costs, not lose profits (obviously).

We used to see it more but quite a few vendors would post that they did such and such amount of Bitcoin transactions with 0% fraud. It's just so unlikely most vendors don't even need 1 confirmation. I've gathered that if any substantial amount of money is being transferred, people will have more than enough patience to wait for 1-2 confirmations. Compared to credit cards, it's so much more trustworthy. Maybe we will see it more in the future? You may be able to find an article about overstock's report on their Bitcoin transactions out there somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:38:15
Thanks for your answer to my question. Seems like the cost increase will be 1. Data Storage(but it's not huge), and 2. Problems for people on capped connections. I feel really bad for people that have capped connections in general but these two things don't add up to that much extra cost, certainly not double the current cost. 
The replay protection issue seems like something that needs to be addressed to bring the community together. I also side with the on chain scaling although its a technology that we can utilize and innovation and progress will only help the blockchain ecosystem.

As someone who banks with USAA, USAA is so far ahead in the technology realm compared to other banks. I can do practically anything on their website or mobile app. USAA has the perfect user base to test new bitcoin-bank systems since so many users are overseas.
One of the biggest benefits bitcoin brings me is the ability to use it anywhere on the globe. Dealing with multiple currencies and/or payment processors is such a pain in the ass. "Do you accept mastercard here?" "I need an ATM that has English and accepts my debit card." With bitcoin so many issues are solved and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
If USAA ever rolls out some bitcoin tech I'll let you guys know how it goes.

I understand where you are coming from but his comment still makes sense. The common denominator with currencies is the users. He isn't saying crypto-currencies rely on nothing, that would be like saying the constantly progressing universe doesn't rely on time. Without time, nothing happens; without users, neither do currencies.

Misleading. 
They provide a service just as a bitcoin wallet provides a service. You expect for the service to be free when it's not necessarily free to transfer bitcoin between wallets? Your only argument could have been that they don't let you choose the transaction fee, but it's their business and their choice. 
And regarding SegWit, the size of the company usually increases the complexity of everything in that company. Things take a lot longer as there are more processes to go through in order to implement something.
Their service isn't perfect, but they don't deserve people misleading newcomers in order for that newcomer to not even consider them as an option. That's what shady BCH fucks do.

~$600,000 USD weekly volume for Russia, up from ~$227,000 USD at the start of the year. Historical exchange rate applied, but it's about the same as it is today. Also noteworthy to point out that the RUB crashed against the USD at the end of 2014.
India, South Africa, and Sweden are also rising on these charts. 
India at ~$53,000 USD up from ~$30,000 in January. India would be a great place for bitcoin. Bitcoin obviously has some serious growing to do in this country of 1.25 billion people.
South Africa at ~$313,000 USD up from just $74,000 in ***April***. Huge jump here.
Sweden at ~$145,000 USD up from ~$60,000 in January.
For reference: USA has a weekly volume of about $4.75M up from $3.5M in January.
All these numbers were based off the charts and googleing exchange rates.

I think bitcoin would have the strongest impact on poorer people, especially families that have someone working in a different country. Good example is Mexican immigrant workers sending money back to Mexico from the US. They go through so much risk and hardship just to be able to support their family and then they get raped on remittances. I would love nothing more than communities embracing bitcoin to raise the median standard of living. It would spark revolutions.

Ever heard of that story where a guy robs a bank for 1 million, buries the money, and then turns himself in. He ends up being sentenced to 1 year in prison but the trick was he never told the police where the money was stashed so when he gets out he has $1M.
If Karpeles knew shit was about to go down and he was about to be burned big time, instead of going on the run, he hides the coins and lets the justice system take him for a bit.

Dude, let me play out this scenario for you. US Marshals are hunting illegal market lord that uses bitcoin/deep web/newer technologies to conduct business. US Marshals get JOHN SMITH, US Marshal expert on all things bitcoin/deep web/new technologies, and tell him to take Silkroad guy down. He says, "Well I need this computer, and that access, and these resources." And then his boss says, "Yeah that's in the budget, whatever you need." 
JOHN SMITH does all sorts of crazy advanced internet/computer shit and takes down revolutionary online drug market and you think he can't transfer some bitcoins because he part of the US government? 
I am only trying to explain this to you because:
1. You are adding horrible and misleading content to this subreddit. I don't want this subreddit to turn further into a giant circlejerk.
2. I hope you can take a small step off that high horse and try to not discourage new people from using bitcoin because it's *so hard*. If I was new and I saw all this IT shit about bitcoin and I'm not in IT, I'm gonna say, "Fuck bitcoin, it's complicated as shit and basically just for computer nerds." I know this is not the case because I am not in IT and I can find my way around bitcoin.
Bitcoin will not succeed this way. When your mother asks how to use bitcoin, you won't tell her she can't. Yes most of the government is behind the curve, but not these guys.
