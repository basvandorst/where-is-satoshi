There already is a working anonymous protocol called CryptoNote that is more anonymous than dark.  The most promising CryptoNote coin is Monero (MRO) which is working on integrating with i2p as well.  It is vastly superior to drk but Is only about a month and a half old. As it uses a different protocol than bitcoin and all the altclones from LTC to DOGE to DRK it is a PIA for exchanges to implement so it's only on a few small ones (most volume is poloniex). It is in such an early stage that the main wallet is command line only with a very beta GUI wallet for testing.  It feels like btc in the early days but seriously could be a real contender as a competitive alt as it develops and word spreads about it.

The debt based money supply is a scam from the beginning because the principle + interest is never released into the money supply so therefore some form of collateral needs to be forked over in the end. The release of Bitcoin into the wild is just another confirmation we live in a crazy Orwell 1984 world where everything is called its opposite. The masses call BTC a pyramid scheme when the current central bank debt based money system is a pyramid scheme.  but apparently those facts make me a lib tinfoil nut because groupthink.

The brochure is from 2001.

No. It also documented the absolute failure of the government to be a governing body that enforces the rule of law on these very criminal enterprises. The article isn't just alleging that Chase and others sold dud investments they fraudulently claimed were of one quality when they were really of another. The article says the DOJ willfully helped to bury any evidence and suppress any charges from being filed. It's alleging that the fox is guarding the henhouse. It even mentions two of the Chase lawyers who were allegedly defending this criminal activity went on to prominent positions at the SEC.  When one is alleging that the entire rule of law is corrupted at the highest levels of one of the most powerful governments in the world then one needs more than a few short paragraphs.

I don't think he hates consumers, I'm just sure he's a henchman for the banking status quo.  The Federal Reserve is owned by its "shareholders" which are all the too big to fail banks like Goldman Sachs, Citi, BofA, JP Morgan Chase, etc. They call the shots and they have regulatory capture in every place that matters... especially places like Treasury Secretary and Department of Financial Services for NY.  So when I look at who Lawsky's gone after its not our TBTF friends it's a British bank who tride to play ball with Iran (threatening our TBTF friend's favorite scam, petrodollar supremacy) and some low level Insurance companies who tried to rig some accounting shenanigans to make their books look good (Who do they think they are?

Until they use their bitcoin-qt and send it without a miner's fee. Or the  employer moves say 1 BTC to a bitcoin.info wallet and then pays .998999 with a miners fee of .001 and the change is less than 54 microBTC. In either of those "honest mistakes" the transfer can take up to several days to go through.  In most cases these aren't issues but they do happen. In legacy banking paying before midnight isn't an issue in most cases but occasionally happens.  Just throwing out a bit of devil's advocate argument here.

The regulations are basically making many people who participate in the bitcoin space have to act like banks. It's like the regulators read the slogan at blockchain.info "be your own bank" and went "uh oh, we have a lot of new banks to regulate."  This is a clash of the old paradigms with new in the most spectacular fashion.  These regulations are kind of akin to making every guy who creates a youtube video have to get all the permits and FCC licensing that a television station has to comply with. Or making any webhost such as godaddy or a guy who sets up a web page on his own dedicated server at home have to comply with all the permits and regs that every single big newspaper publishing company, radio station or television station has to comply with. 
Obviously they don't quite understand what they are dealing with (which is the decentralized nature of the 21st century). Or they do, [tinfoil alert] and banks are trying to do a "shock and awe" opening salvo on decentralized currencies so they don't go the way the RIAA and MPAA did with regard to BitTorrent.

I think the IRS notice is GREAT news because there has been a lot of speculation about Wall Street moving into Bitcoin in a big way late spring or early summer of this year.  This notice codifies the IRS's interpretation of Bitcoin which allows the big funds to be able to start speculating on Bitcoin with proper tax guidance. Prior to this announcement they really couldn't be making any large forays into the cryptocurrency sphere.  I'm surprised I am not seeing more acknowledgement of this possible interpretation of this conveniently timed IRS notice.

Most digital goods aren't as liquid as bitcoin or there's a central party on the other side to invalidate codes that are liquid. So say you bought a bunch of iTunes gift codes or steam game codes Apple and Valve can just invalidate those gift codes once the money is reversed.

Bitcoin is a surveillance state's wet dream. I'm pretty sure it's trivial to unanonymize most addresses unless the strictest in precautions were taken. But most people aren't up to that task. With military tech being 10-20 years past consumer grade and all the network analysis of social media, ip addresses, and people who have willingly given their info at an exchange I'm sure bitcoin isn't nearly as anonymous as most people think. It's similar to how if one uses all the encrypted phones, text and email in the world, the people they communicate to aren't so it doesn't really matter.
Wouldn't it serve the interests of a surveillance state to publicly bemoan a new form of currency as being "too anonymous and allowing for shady activity" while privately having all the means to track it like a tagged steer? "Lol they think they're being all anonymous as they spend their money here and there. Suckers"
I'm sure the government already knows most of what's going on on Silk Road, given that a recent paper indicated it would only take $11,000 in computing power to remove the anonymity from the place.  To those saying "Well, why haven't they shut it down yet?" Well why hasn't the government shut down every marijuana dispensary operating against federal law? Why doesn't the government use the back door built into all major communications to stop every weed deal done in the country? Who knows? Maybe the time isn't right. Maybe they are operating on the principle of Mao's "let a hundred flowers blossom"  which was his way of saying "go ahead and dissent, we like free speech (it lets us know who to round up later)"
The point is, maybe the anonymity of Silk Road is stripped already, and its just serving as one of the biggest narcotics honeypots the Internet has ever known. Further, the same could be true of bitcoin itself. ICSPA is compromised of all the alphabet agencies with the capabilities to be stripping anonymity, so this whole article could be a brilliant Psy Op to let bitcoin users who want to use it for nefarious deeds think they're so anonymous and proceed with abandon. Just an alternative viewpoint.

There would be some consequences if he were to become dishonest. Friedcat holds a large number of shares himself so if he were to suddenly turn scam artist it would shoot himself in the foot. Now of course he could then just sit and solo mine with all those blades and let his shares go worthless but by being honest he has the potential to turn his millions into billions.

Beautiful.  The amount of Fear Uncertainty and Doubt that article spreads means its a great time to be buying bitcoins. If everybody was on board you run the risk of tulipmania.  If the consensus view is what I'm seeing in that article then now is the time to buy. Just by running the name bitcoin around random people I know they either haven't heard of it or they say things like, "Oh you mean that digital funny money?"  This feels like the gold market in 2005.

Seriously though.

This is kind of a fake argument. It's like the media companies that make books, movies, games and music saying every pirated product is a dollar that doesn't go to their company when the truth is, if the person hasn't pirated and there was no means to they were unlikely to buy the product anyway. 
Every dollar that goes into the ETF isn't necessarily a dollar that would have gone to a place like Mt Gox. If it's a dollar tied up in an IRA or stuck in some other investment fund that couldn't just be pulled out and put in an exchange then the Winklevoss ETF isn't taking that dollar from the Bitcoin economy.
They are performing a service in an area that is currently lacking, which is letting all those people with dollars stuck in places like IRAs have some exposure to the Bitcoin market.
To your second point, I am in agreement with you and do share some of the same trepidation as you.

In this market you literally can buy and sell whenever you want. The market is open 24/7 unlike wall st. By on sale I mean the price is low compared to what it has been trading at and what it likely will be trading at. It is currently trading around 2.5-3 btc a share while the company owner is paying smaller dividends than he had been because he is currently reinvesting money into the company for their new generation of equipment which once online should make the company see its former glory.  Asicminer is the only company in the bitcoin sphere that actually has followed through closely with their plans and do what they say they'll do. They also ship their (overpriced) mining equipment to customers on time and it works as expected.
  The companies referred to in your linked comment are and have been bad investments because there are a lot of btc mining companies that only purchased mining equipment second hand but didn't manufacture their own. Those companies saw a steep decline in price as everyone realized they couldn't keep up with the network hashrate.
Even a lot of people have lost money in AsicMiner if they were foolish and sold this week while it saw a decline in price. It is likely to stay somewhat lower in price until October when their new gen tech comes online.  
Yes all of these are risky, but in context, I was responding to a comment you made asking if you should invest in asic mining equipment. In that context, investing in something like AsicMiner today at its currently depressed share price and holding until Christmas is much more likely to see your bitcoin wallet expand vs buying mining equipment yourself and trying to mine for BTC. (To clarify, not all asic mining equipment comes from the company AsicMiner, they are just one big producer of Asic mining equipment that also mines with chips they produce)
Trying to mine yourself you basically have two options, buying a block eruptor from Asicminer and getting something that might produce the amount of bitcoins you spent on it in a year or so and then costs more in power than it produces by mining. Or buy from one of the other Asic producers and you will maybe get the miner someday and maybe you make back the number of bitcoins you spent on it before power costs more than the btc it produces. In those scenarios the mining equipment itself is worthless at the end and you can't sell it for a nickel. 
With a security like asicminer you face other risks such as it being on an unregulated exchange which could be shut down by some sort of government intervention (though there are fails safes where your pass through shares in AsicMiner get transferred to direct shares off exchange in that event). Or AsicMiner's owner, friedcat could disappear one day.  
But aside from those less than likely scenarios what you're getting is a share in a giant mining farm that pays you a weekly dividend that's on average .0018 btc a week per share that keeps up with the difficulty raises in the network and the share price over time likely appreciates. 
So buying AsicMiner on btct.co is like buying a piece of mining equipment that you could mine with for a year and then sell back to the market for around what you paid for it. Which is a lot better than the scenario where you buy a piece of mining equipment, are out all the money you paid for it, and then maybe make back around what you paid for it over a year and then can't sell the equipment itself to anybody. 
And keep in mind it's all risky, the "conservative" play in the already risky world of bitcoin investing is to just buy and hold bitcoin, preferably with some sort of cost averaging strategy where you just set aside some money and buy the same fiat currency amount each month.  I'm just saying if you're going to get into mining, the more likely profitable scenario would be to buy Asicminer stock.
@_date: 2013-07-07 07:06:16
Cashintocoins.com if you have a Wells Fargo or Chase bank near you. As long as you can get to the bank within banking hours you can get bitcoins from that site within about two hours.

Bonairan. Which has absolutely no relevance to my point.  The USA is "The United States of America" and the culture and citizens are not referred to as USish, Unitedans, USAish, Statans or USAns. They are called Americans. It is unfortunate that the continent also has North, South and Central America as a shared designation. No one gets upset or offended from any other country on the continent when one says they are from America and mean the USA. A Canadian would say they are North American. A Peruvian would say they are South American if they wanted to identify in a continental sense. I don't know where this "stop saying your from America" shit started with Europeans getting all smug when they say it to you. It fits with the passive aggression at the USA for their empire expanding ways but it's one argument they shouldn't have picked. I can understand Europeans giving Americans crap when they say some dumb shit like "2nd world" or "3rd world" but the whole "don't say you're from America" line is crap.

Hey lewicki, the main concern for me when assessing AMC (other than the numerous typos and unfinished parts on their website) is the giant target Ken paints on his back declaring who he is and what he's doing. He is so out in the open as opposed to friedcat and he's raising investment funds on dubious unregulated exchanges. I know it's hard for the US regulators to target the exchanges but a guy in the US with a US address seems like a perfect target for the US regulators to make an example of. Do you have any insight into that potential pitfall? 
Also, he seems to be making his potential mining farm location publicly known. That seems dangerous as he is essentially saying "I have an electronic mint at this location." Will he have the security to ensure his mining equipment is extremely well guarded once it's up and running?
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:51:30
It actually strikes me as a good attitude. He says he uses them and spends them on stuff and doesn't convert them back into fiat. Ideally that would be the proper attitude to further widespread adoption with everybody just having a BTC wallet that they use to buy things and accept money with but not to swap in and out of fiat like a speculator.
@_date: 2013-08-27 03:57:36

After playing for a bit I hit "lose" on the 50% satoshidice 13 times in a row costing me 8 BTC back in the $12 btc days. I never rebought back then because the whole thing pissed me off.

So like Santa makes this nice long list with all the names of good little boys and girls and what they're getting for Xmas. Bitcoin is like Santa but has a nice long list called le blockchain. But bitcoin Santa lets nice boys and girls give each other the presents they have on the list. There are bitcoin elves that make the presents at a rate of 25 new presents every 10 minutes. Some people call them miners. So if Timmy says I want to give Kelsey 5 presents the elves will update Santas list to remove 5 presents from the long number (wallet address) that goes with Timmy and put it  by Kelsey's address.  So everyone in the world can see Santas list with all the presents promised to all the nice boys and girls at blockchain.info and add their own name to the list there and start asking for presents at mtgox.com and then transfer their presents to others. 
Also there will only be 21 million presents ever. And the elves will later only get presents for themselves from skimming the presents they transfer from name to name in small present fees. Oh and you can transfer fractions of presents down to just the edge of a piece of wrapping paper.

To get in this late to the mining game a quick way to jump the line is to create accounts on weexchange and bitfunder and purchase ADDICTION mining shares.  They have a whole bunch of preorders for KNC miners that are day one and day two machines at the head of the line and the shares are equal to a portion of the miners. So each share is around .01 bitcoin and worth 32 mhs so your $7000 would get you roughly 224 GH/s worth and the shipping is slated for the 1st week of September (probably a bit less as $7000 entering the stock would make the price move a bit so you'd get less than 7000 shares). The ROI on the shares even if the difficulty is 80mil is under 2 months and of course once the miners arrive the share prices would go above what you paid for them so you could "sell your miner" (sell your shares) for more than you paid for them.  This is all contingent on KNC shipping according to schedule of course, but as far as getting in on mining in the month of August it's probably one of the best bets.
So in an ideal hypothetical scenario would be: you buy them for .01. The miners arrive first week of September. You receive dividends for two months on them to get your .01 back while the share price climbs to .03 and then sell your shares for that. Then your 70 BTC initial investment is worth 280 BTC.  All possible, but knc could not ship. But everything from them so far indicates they're legit and on schedule.

Create a new wallet address. Either edit the original shared post or add a comment to it on facebook.  Then say "this is the donation address for people to contribute to wallet setup requests anything added to this wallet will be added to my initial .01 and disbursed in X hours" with a link to the blockchain.info page of that wallet ID. Then in X hours when you split up the donations among all your requests everyone can see the transactions on the blockchain evenly split. With regards to my donation just add it to the "donation address" you post.  It will be a great way to demonstrate to bitcoin noobs the transparent function of bitcoin. :) Cheers!
Edit: Now that you have gotten so much exposure, if you do this, it might be wise to add your .01 to this new address through a mixer so 10,000 people can't see how much of your net worth you personally have in bitcoins. :)

Wow everyone got a bit touchy. In standard business if say coca cola is the status quo for the primary cola beverage they are going to conspire to keep it the standard cola beverage in as many places as they can.  More recently in a similar scenario BitTorrent has threatened the old model of media distribution of music/movie labels.  Those labels conspired to try to shut it down by working with courts, ISPs and cyber companies that introduced monitoring peers in the trackers to track IPs of downloaders.  Acting like companies with vested interests (such as PayPal and Credit Card companies who stand to lose a lot in transaction fees if BTC was widely adopted) aren't at least discussing strategies to mitigate the threat of BTC to their bottom line is incredibly naive.  It doesn't matter that its still small and most of the public's reaction is "satoshi will just print all the coins and cash out his ponzi scheme!!!1!" It's something on the horizon that could threaten their bottom line and there's a good chance they are aware of it and strategizing about it on some level.
