only if you think bitcoin is going to shoot back up. If you short a bitcoin when the price is 5k, you sell the bitcoin for 5k, then buy it for less at some point in time and return that bitcoin to the person you borrowed it from, making a profit in dollars.
With this service you give them a bitcoin when the price is 5k, and then at some point in time they will give you more than one bitcoin, but  you would still only be able to sell that amount of coins for 5k.

rational is someone that makes more than they spend on the miner (in terms of BTC value).
Spending 10 bitcoins to make 9 is irrational. Spending 10 to make 11 is rational. If that 11 comes from actual mining or selling/leasing your miner to someone else it doesn't matter, you win.
Also, the number of bitcoins (or amount of cash to buy bitcoins) is the number that really matters. Using round numbers to make the math easier. If you spend 1 coin to buy a miner when the price was $600, and the price goes up to $1000 but the miner only generated .7 coins before it stopped generating enough to pay for electricity. You spent $600 to make $700, looks good on paper, but it was actually silly because you could have made $400 by literally doing nothing.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:50:15
The hashrate would stop going up if greedy people stopped buying useless mining machines.
Miners are in a bad situation because they made a bad decision to spend enough money to buy 5 bitcoins on a machine that will never generate 5 bitcoins.
Instead of ust pumping up the price you should try to educate people to stop buying shitty miners/cloud mining services. If people stopped buying miners the difficulty would level off, some miners might actually make money, and the price can level off to where it should be, not where it's been pumped up in the past.

It's not about stopping mining. It's about not making the silly decision to buy new miners that will never generate as many coins as you can buy the day you bought the miner. Once you buy the miner, you might as well plug it in until you can't pay for power, but it just doesn't make sense to spend enough money to buy 1 bitcoin on a machine that will generate less than 1 bitcoin.

Some are irrational, most got burned by being greedy.
It would be completely irrational to buy a BFL monarch when BFL will have them in hand, but because people were greedy and paid for them up front they will use them when they finally get them to try and get some ROI instead of it being a total waste. Also the miners who rent/lease their miners via cloud mining are very rational, but being funded by irrational/greedy people.
In the real world BFL monarchs (and most ASIC miners) would never exist because they would have stopped trying to make them by now because they would never be able to sell them, but since they were already paid for, they get made and plugged in, making the difficulty go up, and causing the cycle to continue.

That may work according to your logic but that isn't how they said they were going to do it, and not how they looked at things. No one bid for 3,000 coins. You could bid for 3,000 or a little bit less. It just so happens that one person put in the 9 highest bids for 3k and the highest bid for the smallest block.

Yes, it takes 3 advanced degrees to look at 10,00,000 per week and 480,000,000 per year and realize that something isn't right.
Either way, this type of analysis is pointless. The price of bitcoin is irrelevant to a silk road user. If I want $500 worth of product, I'll buy $500 worth of bitcoin. Whether that means i need to buy 500 coins, 5,000 coins, or 0.44453927 coins is completely irrelevant.
To calculate a true "worth" you need to find a reason for people to need 1 bitcoin, and silk road is not that.

The problem can be that it's very easy for these to be actual scams.
If you are running a cloud mining operation, and you know people are going to give you 1 bitcoin and you will provide them with hashpower to generate .8 bitcoins, why bother with the hardware? Or why not pull a Producers and sell 1000% of your hardware?

How much money are we talking about here? 
If you are an employee as opposed to a contractor, they really should be "figuring out the tax stuff."
If you really do own a business you need to fill out schedule C for running a sole proprietorship. Getting paid in bitcoin means you also need to fill out a schedule D for capital gains and losses, and that will just further complicate things.
If you really are running a business, everyone that pays you needs to give you a 1099 showing how much they paid you, and you use that and all your business expenses to fill out schedule C.

People need to stop preordering miners. Any sort of delay really screws with the profitability (if it ever actually comes). 
If people didn't preorder these things, there wouldn't be so many made because no one would buy one of these off the shelf.
But since the money was paid up front, people get them and plug them in to try and make back some of their money instead of watching it all disappear, that makes the difficulty go up, that makes people try to build better miners, that makes the whole cycle start over/continue.
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:29:20
The greed came from people preordering miners that a lick of common sense would have told them weren't going to arrive on time/ever.

If they are running a mining operation, they are mining coins, and sending them to users. There's no real room for fraud on anyone else's part in there.
So they are either incompetent or liars, why waste time figuring out which one it is, the end result is the same, your coins are gone

They are going to owe people forever. According to the example they gave, only 2 people will really be paid back at a time, the guy with the biggest balance and the guy with the smallest balance. They earned 64.68 btc in the best period in their report. the guy with the 2nd highest balance will never see a cent.
If they really want to reduce the number, they can set aside a portion of revenues to pay off the bottom guys in this manner, but the rest really should be proportional to everyone else, because I don't see how the top down method will get past the first guy unless all the big balances have conveniently bailed already.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:33:24
Because you can get more bitcoins from buying bitcoins today than you can get from using that money to buy a miner or a mining contract.
The point of mining is to get bitcoins, You can take x dollars and get y bitcoins, or take x dollars and buy a machine/contract that will give you less than y bitcoins. That wasn't always the case, and may not always be the case in the future, but it is right now.
@_date: 2014-07-31 13:49:26
not enough to change the price. The difficulty readjusts to keep the number of new coins generated relatively constant, no matter how many people are mining. The supply keeps going up, so the demand needs to go up faster for the price to go up.

Paying much more money to mine bitcoins than it would cost to buy them on the market is not an advantage. The sooner you and the miners figure it out the sooner things can get better.
A combination of incompetence, greed, preorders,  and cloud mining is pushing the difficulty higher than it should be; and those bad initial decisions (buying miners) is forcing extra pressure to sell coins, which pushes the price further down, which makes the cycle continue.
Trying to bail out people who did something stupid isn't going to help, its just going to help perpetuate the cycle.
And adoption doesn't make it harder, people plugging in miners makes it harder

But there is only 1 birdhouse made by me and 8 billion people.
Just being rare doesn't make something valuable. Bitcoins are obviously more valuable than my birdhouse, but unless all 8 billion people think they are really valuable, comparing the number of coins to people in the world is useless.

-ev bets are -ev no matter how many times to you them or what the odds are. A bet that you win 98% of the time but has a negative expected value is great until it isn't.

That appeal might be pointless, if he is DPR, he can get convicted on stuff without using the info on the server (if it was illegally searched/seized which we don't know). Worst case if it was illegally seized, by the time they sort it out the trial in Maryland gets him for being DPR and soliciting murder.
There must be other ways for "DPR" to go to jail besides what's on the server, otherwise he would admit to being DPR and say that it was illegally searched.

You must not have looked at very many speakers lists at bitcoin conferences in the past.

You're honestly better off letting him show up and trying to get him to answer some real questions about his bullshit
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:58:47
paycoin was created from the ashes of a failed cloud mining operation. Lots of the people with money tied up there were trying to get involved in bitcoin and weren't smart enough to realize they jumped into a scam.
This ending badly will take a lot of money out of the crypto world and a lot of potential users will be turned off.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:24:10
I don't care when he said the date was because I'm not stupid enough to get involved in this obvious scam, but the whole thing is bullshit.
I definitely don't have the time to sort through and find the exact lies but it's all horseshit. Amazon, 20 dollar floor, never obsolete hashlets, completetly fabricated mining pools, etc, etc.
If you feel like trusting that guy with your money, that's your business, but don't throw a hissy fit when people call you out on your bullshit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:53:44
Same logic applies to mining, which makes cloud mining even more insane.
Bitcoin isn't going to really get going until someone comes up with a plan besides "take advantage of people who are bad at math" because that seems to be the only businesses that accomplish anything here.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:40:25
He's kind of in trouble. All the info is on the servers, they tried to say that getting the servers was a 4th amendment violation, but the feds (and judge) said that they were registered to Dread Pirate Roberts, so only that person can even attempt to argue that.
So he can admit to being DPR and try to get the server thrown out (but have to deal with a whole bunch of other shit) or let the info into the trial and continue claiming he isn't DPR.

and then ross admitted he started the site and got arrested while sitting at a laptop logged in to the site.
Usually you try to argue that the cops did a shitty job because they just came up with one suspect and focused on them, changing suspects midstream shows they did a thorough job.

Since when does getting people to give you money to literally do nothing mean you don't know anything about economics?
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:07:24
Yes, but there's a big difference between being able to give his bullshit answers on his forum or his video chats and in person with allegedly competent people around.
I doubt he will say he's robbing people straight out, but it will be a lot harder for him to bs his way out of questions in person.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:12:49
Not sure that this is a bomb that people are making it out to be. He thought it was Karpeles, and then eventually got turned on to Ross, who invented the site and got caught red handed running it.
The fact that DHS looked at multiple suspectsdoesn't really mean anything.

If you can't figure this out on your own just ring your call button, and Tommy will come back there and hit you over the head with a tack hammer because you are a retard.

How did you not make money selling paycoins on paybase for $20 and selling them at other prices with a spread from the price you were using to buy them?
How much money did you make selling Hashlets to people that mined hashpoints that people bought because they were told they could exchange for $20 paycoins on paybase?
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:49:50
Does that track coins in actual addresses or just the numbers they claimed on the site?
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:33:23
How is that non-factual?

didn't that have some sort of payment plan. Wonder how that's going to turn out.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:51:10
Geniuses gave them bitcoins and money to hold and didn't get it back, that's a scam.
Whether they took it themselves or were too stupid to stop someone else from taking it is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:28:00
Are they claiming that paycoins are a commodity that falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC? Seems like that would be a lot harder to deal with than just buying or selling the coins for 20.

Why is Josh more trustworthy when he lies about everything?
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:11:06
The problem is that the big mining machines will still exist somewhere, and can get plugged back in if the difficulty gets low enough.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:41:00
Get your priorities in order.
All the people that should be throwing their money at bitcoins to bring the price up are throwing their money into the pit of GAW. You guys have to slay that beast before you can continue with the main mission.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:35:06
there are people spewing the same nonsense you just did in every one of those scam threads on bitcointalk when people try to point out how these are scams before they collapse. You can't fix stupid.

better for him than anyone else involved.

And the source from amazon on the record saying that they are on board with paycoin is?

"we will purchase paycoins for at least $20 per coin the second Paybase launches."
"we will buy your xpy for $20 each with NO verification and as soon as you open your account!"
These are not ambiguous at all, and they are both 100% false. How could anyone defend this shit?
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:09:43
There must be evidence besides the server showing that "DPR" should be in jail, otherwise why wouldn't he admit to being DPR?

If Ross is acquitted that doesn't stop them from finding and putting the real DPR on trial
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:54:31
The only reason the coins have any value is because he said he would buy them for 20, if he openly sells all those coins he won't get much for them.
The exchange is just the next new thing. He makes a promise, everyone gets excited, the promise falls through, he says "don't worry, you can make more money doing this, it will take some time" and then the cycle starts over again.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:34:34
not sure about Gox, but Neo was a scam from day 1. He ripped people off with some concert thing before, and he did it with Neo. Neo never actually did anything. They talked a lot and spent a lot of people's money, but they never actually did a thing.
He's all over the place to get people to give him more money.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:35:31
The genesis block had over 96% of the coins that exist today, if they wanted to control the price they could right now.

Bullshit? From GAW? Surely you jest.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:04:19
Can you sell coins for 20 on paybase right now?
The answer to that would be yes if there was a floor.

I'm sure your great grandchildren will appreciate that when bitcoin inflation finally stops in 2140
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:25:56
No, because you couldn't get cash out of there.
You needed to buy bitcoins because you could withdraw them, so it was ok to pay a premium for the coins because you could get them out, but couldn't get the cash out.

It's tough for these legitimate people trying to business with bitcoin. 
The scammers are going to fuck everything up and bring on government attention/intervention faster and harder than if they didn't exist, so they want to step in and help. But they always wait too late and just end up stepping into the shit and dragging everyone down.
