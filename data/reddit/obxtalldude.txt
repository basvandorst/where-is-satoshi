There is wisdom in this post. When my car mechanic started talking to me about stocks was the day I should have sold.

Good try, and I'm slightly encouraged that there were a few people on the thread who got it.  I like the line "when was the last time your bank account dropped because the bank lent out your money?".
But those bankers who don't get it... I guess abstract thinking and banking are not a good combo.

All I want to do is have more regulations for banks and higher taxes on their profits because they're basically guaranteed to make money... literally.

I suppose you could - wouldn't the "bitcoin tokens" be a store of value like a dollar though?  Or perhaps just the promise of bitcoins is all you need to "create" bitcoins?
Interesting concept - I'll have to think it through.

No need to change the underlying mechanics of our economic system, it works fairly well.  We just need a fairer distribution of resources.  Which requires electing liberals.  So... vote.

It does work pretty well.  I just don't think people realize how much money banks make, literally and figuratively, from the practice.  My only argument is banks need to be regulated as utilities rather than private entities since they are so uniquely positioned and such a huge part of our economy.

Wait until people understand fractional reserve banking.
Never mind, people never understand fractional reserve banking, and so long as the mass delusion of of the dollar continues everything will be fine.  It would take an alternative delusion to upset the balance.
