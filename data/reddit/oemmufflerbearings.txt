Tried to cash some out to cover some hardware costs, sent it with a low TX fee (90sat/byte).
All it did was pend for like a week then get returned, and now it's worth far less at the very time I need to cover $350 for the GPU I just bought. Would have been cheaper for me to just pay a higher fee.
On the plus side the next one I sent at 100sat/byte finally went through, due to the coinbase outage and subsequent mempool clearing.

Honestly that barrier is what put me off it.
But you could still mine them fairly early on, even just using a basic PC.
Although that barrier is what made me a fair bit of returns. I'd been mining for the last year on nicehash that pays in bitcoin, never cashed it out, then it surged. I don't have a life changing amount, but my motorcycle fund is looking a lot better nowdays, previously had enough for a helmet, now I can almost afford the rest of the bike. Didn't cash some of it out for the first time until like 2 weeks ago, used it to buy another GPU.

Canadian, with RBC, and this was during 2010.

Yeah I was going through a phase so I just did it anyways. 
The annoying thing was I had it on one of the many extra drives that I had to remove from my PC to make room for the second GPU. I guess it made my wallet safer to be on a drive sitting on a shelf in my closet.

Same, could have been though.
I remember thinking "I'm not paying $25 for a goddamn bitcoin". Oh how I wish I could go back in time and kick my broke college student ass. Hindsight is 20/20 though.

Most? 
I’ll let you in on a little secret, banks aren’t interested in your financial well being, and responsible use of money, they’re only interested in making money off of their customers.
And the most effective method of doing that is giving you just enough credit to financially hang yourself, so you can spend the rest of your entire life making interest payments.
As a student I told them my income in $0, fuck all, they gave me a credit card with a $2000 limit, and have tried to up it every time I call them for anything else. My friend (also a student) asked for a line of credit and got $20,000. 
And I’m Canadian, don’t even get me started on 18 year old US university students who are raking up 6 figure debts that can’t be discharged. Whose repayments are constantly going to be fucked with, applied incorrectly, and purposely made difficult to re-pay. 
Or all the fake accounts Wells Fargo, and TD Canada opened, this is literally outright fraud, I can’t think of a better example to drive home just how unethical and relentless banks are. They’re literally scammers. 
And I say this all as someone who isn’t in debt, has excellent credit, and is in excellent terms with my bank, I’m just aware they’ll try and fuck me the first chance they get.

Probably US tech workers. Were probably the first ones savvy enough to know about crypto, just from being surrounded by that sort of environment. Also they gave them 6 figure salaries fresh out of school.
So tech + disposable income + young (so they still make super risky investments), means if they were fucking around with crypto like 2-3 years now, they're up orders of magnitude of their initial investment.
In dec 2017 it was up 50x from Jan 2016. 
Having $100,000 in crypto a month ago means they had $2000 worth in Jan 2016.

Funny story, people were actually using their credit cards to buy thousands and thousands of coins, from the mint.
They then collected a lot of air miles and various other CC rewards, including cash back. Then went and paid their credit cards using the newly minted coins they had ordered.

Have you even been to ? A lot of people have a lot of money "missing" and haven't been able to get ahold of support people for months.
Seems like they're fine until they aren't, then it's just a stone wall with a sign on it that says "Your money's gone, now fuck off".

But the point is, it also could have halved, or even gone to 0, you couldn’t have predicted the future.
I’m sure there’s several week spans people who cashed out thought that about Apple or Cisco, but there’s also several week spans people who cashed out at a profit probably thought the same about Enron. 
But at the moment you cashed out, you made a profit, and that’s what matters. You got 100% of your investment back, and then some. Don’t get hung up on the “what if”s.

The richest guy I know always says “There’s never a bad time to take a profit” 
I take it as you can’t predict the future, but if you’re up, you’re up.

He sounded so logical and reasonable until he dropped the 20% bombshell.
I can’t imagine having that much riding on this.
Unless it’s like his first week of worth after graduating and his net worth is going to double his next paycheck.

I got spooked by the Tether thing and cashed out half on Monday.
So my cashed out half’s reaction is “hahahaha holy shit”
Then I remember my remaining half and it’s “awww” 
Then I realize I got it all for $0 through mining with GPUs I already owned in the first place and my reaction is “Meh”.

I’d just been reading lots of articles that made me raise my eyebrow, and when they fired their auditor, that just seemed like a bad sign.
The thing is, the only news there is currently is like a 2 month old subpoena.
Honestly I’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
Or maybe that’s not what’s affecting this at all, I didn’t study Finance or Economics in school, so these are just the speculative ramblings of a programmer who should probably spend more time doing his job rather than reading articles about crypto.

Depends how much you pay.
At Canadian rates, it’s like 0.07kWh. 
For me that’s 10%, and that’s at the current reduced profits (and with power hungry AMD cards).

That’s why I bought GPUs.
My girlfriend asked me “What if it goes to 0?”
“Then me and my boys are all going to be gaming with kickass graphics”. 
Hell my friend dabbles in crypto but spends the rest of his time gaming on a 2GB 760. The crash will be more of a favour to him than it is going up (Because he’ll likely get my spare R9 Fury). Hell my other broke friend might even get my main card if I can scoop up a cheap VEGA finally.

I can afford to fix my car if it breaks down, but I’d be sad about saying goodbye to that cash. 
It’s like some people don’t care about any money that they didn’t immediately need to pay their bills within the next pay period. Then again that kinda explains a lot of consumer habits. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:59:57
Why wouldn't you just one 580 in your PC and pause mining when you want to game?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:19:14
Yeah, I’ve only added a single GPU I wouldn’t otherwise already own. Paid for by gains I cashed out when I bought it. 
I owned most of this stuff by coincidence because I wanted a second PC for gaming at my girlfriend’s house, and owned 1440p FreeSync monitors. 
I also purposely overbuy PSUs “just in case” (I used to dabble in crossfire with 290s, I wanted to have the power to blindly run anything, so I’ve got a 1000W gold and 850W plat in the mATX at my gf’s). 
Only reason I didn’t expand anymore is because I didn’t want to draw too much attention to my landlord or my girlfriend’s landlord’s power bills, especially when we’ve already got the windows cracked 2” in a Canadian winter just to cool what I’m already running during the evening so we can sleep. I also can’t fit any more inside the cases, and having racks and riser cables would make it way too obvious if the landlords do start to wonder.
