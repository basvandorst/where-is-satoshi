The use of a distributed system gets its greatness from the resilience it brings. The greatest achievement is creating a system that can not be controlled or tampered with by a small percentage of the users.
The second most important feature is the work distribution, something that is a problem with Bitcoins. A user should only be able to use a system if he contributes to it.
The future of cloud storage for example, is a blockchain-like system where users provide storage and bandwidth. And gets a share of the distributed cloud in proportion to his contribution.
The problem with bitcoin is that the miners are separated from the users. Once "all" coins have been mined, there is no incentive to actually contribute to the system. This will however probably be solved long before it becomes a problem.

12 comments and only you Kendall got it right. Feels good to know at least someone else actually understands the fundamentals of Bitcoin. 
For the rest of you, currencies based on work instead of debt will actually require work in order to make a profit.

Screw you guys! This is how it works, FRB is a system that simultaneously allows inflation and deflation, depending on the amount of money you control. 
If you earn and spend all the money you control within a year, then you can not invest them to beat inflation(roughly, you don't have enough to save in any larger quantities is my point). Thus, the work you have performed to earn money is being devalued with time, forcing you to continue to work. The fact that you don't earn enough to save for investments needed for living a decent life exaggerates the slavery further by forcing you to borrow money. Now, not only does the work you've done get devalued over time but you are paying interest to be able to work. Your loans get devalued by inflation, which seems beneficial to you but but the house you've bought will eventually cost you a lot more than if you had been able to save the money without them inflating away. You are living the inflationary dream :)
On the other side is the person living in a deflationary economy. It has enough money to live and invest at the same time. The investments it makes yields profits beating inflation. Thus he is living in a deflationary economy. Its wealth is ever growing, everything is getting cheaper all the time. And guess were this persons yields are coming from? Yes, the inflation ridden worker bee. 
May the odds be ever in favor.

Great post! The technology is so much more than people realize today. Truly revolutionary! In the way writing, book printing and the internet was! We are barely starting to realize the potential.

It's bad if it turns out that Peter is a complete idiot(which i truly doubt). But what's worse is that it turns out he is as greedy and manipulative as the people that he has been fighting all these years.

Please don't say intrinsic or inherent or anything else that tries to separate types of value. Either something has a value or it doesn't. Out of the total value of a cd, how much was inherent and how much was something else? And what is the other type of value? How does it differ from  inherent? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:43:25
Yes, this wasn't really a debate about whether it has a value. Rather some good arguments to use while convincing people it does. Thanks anyway!

Maybe learn to set up Google 2fa next time. Just go to settings and set up backup phone number. Or print offline codes. This is not a problem. Do a remote wipe off your phone as soon you realize it's gone. Change to sms codes to your backup number. Then move to other phone.

So you understood nothing I said I guess. The value of the currency is expressed in how much of something you can get for a specific amount of currency(relative value). You just expressed the value of euro relative to bread. That specific relative value has been more stable than the price of bread in bitcoins, yes.

So beautiful headstone and story. I'm so sorry for your loss. Though i mourn less for you than those who never get to feel the true and beautiful love you describe. I get tears in my eyes sitting in front of my computer at work. Not a religious person but i do believe in something. That we are all connected in some way. Somehow Bitcoin has some philosophical similarity to us humans. Everyone is a node in a decentralized network of fates and souls, individually replaceable and insignificant yet together we are extremely sophisticated and beautiful.

What do you think/hope it will be that replaces democracy the way Bitcoin is replacing fiat?
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:03:24
Jesus Christ that's a thick head to get trough. You obviously live inside a textbook of macro economics written a hundred years ago. If you do not care for the reality of the world then you will never understand the bitcoin economy. Let go of your foolish definitions and there is a chance. Bitcoin lending will be there for you to study in real life in a couple of years. Then you might understand.

If just for once could someone here provide arguments for what the believe will happen! Please don't just be a badger badger badge badger badger mushroom mushroom!

Headline reads: China bans bitcoin.
Loving this article also, one of swedens biggest economy news sites. And probably the worst one in the world. We should really just flood their comment section to make them change the headline.

Cant explain in how many ways this is wrong. But i will try to explain why you are completely wrong. Bitcoins can be lent, you just misunderstood what lending is. Lending is when you posses something and for a defined period of time let someone else hold that something. Creating something out of nothing is not possible in any way shape or form. So for me to create a purely fictional something out of nothing and then let you hold it is not lending, because i did not posses this something to begin with. It did not even exist.
Bitcoins represent a value, this is something that fiat does not do since its not limited in currency amount. The value of bitcoin is related to the work that has been done to achieve it. Fiat has a value in relation to the debt it represents, no proof of work being done is needed, it does not represent a value. If something ever could be created out of nothing, then that something would  by default have no value since it is unlimited in supply. If supply and demand is setting the price. 
Say that i hold 100BTC then i could easily lend you 50 of those, i would have incentive to do this because i could charge you interest. However i would not be able to charge you 6% interest rate, rather 1%. This is because there is no fictional new money created to cover the interest rate. Interest payments would act as redistribution of money from the consumer through the producer and ending up at the lender. The rates would be set by demand and supply, and with the enormous wealth held by a few, there would be a huge amount of "inactive" coins available for lending. This is not easy to understand for someone stuck in a inflationary economy loop. The incentive for lending is the possibility of relative profit compared to the regular deflation that everyone's coins are experiencing. If everyone's money value is increasing with in same rate, then there is no relative value increase. The effective market would soon disregard the deflationary effects since they are equal for everyone.

"Although both parties in a Bitcoin transaction are anonymous, the details of all transactions — the address of the buyer and seller, the quantity, and the date — are publicly known, chronicled in a master ledger now overseen by BlockChain.info."

Rule number one. Prices are relative, there is no fix point, EVER. This is essential to truly understanding economics, sadly it is almost never taught at universities and almost no one in mainstream media or corporations grasps this basic fact.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:27:35
Just pointing it out because a lot of people use the term like it's a absolute truth that value can be separated into inherent and something else. I like the analogy but I'm afraid this term has caused both Peter and others quite a lot of time arguing up the wrong tree so to speak :) Great post, keep it up!

How can i use torrent technology to get and contribute to a distributed cloud storage? Please read the whole text, maybe even some links so you understand what im saying. And please provide your own link to what you are referring to.
