If.. after bitcoin what next future monetary system will we have?

**This is a scam**, most known for binary options scams via Facebook cryptocurrency groups. They explain to you so you can get interest and then they will ask you to connect to their service by you sending money to their wallet such as [blockchain.info]( and then asking for your private key and such, etc.
This is actually "social engineering" you into giving your wallet information to them.

Wow, Paypal implementing bitcoin.. what a prize that would be!

Bitcoin is not the most safe place to put your money as it is volatile.

If there is any announcement such as this, anything is bound to happen such as, verifying your identity but your account is still not verified. So its better to just leave Poloniex.

Very nice colors, seems very appealing to the eye, almost like eye-candy; candy for your eyes.

Bitcoin is slow and expensive, there shouldn’t be an ‘or’ in the title.

When Bitcoin dominates BCash fees will go back higher.

No, this is uncommon sense.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:00:38
Market is undergoing a very bearish period which might be for some while.

How much years are you willing to wait to be successful?

Investing in the crypto market, I just want to invest with bigger funds.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:45:37
 when and if you get your account unfrozen can I have 1 bitcoin out of your 1200 bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:08:27
You must negotiate with yourself, if you should sell now and buy at a lower rate. This would be profitable way back when bitcoin was stable in the $6000's.

I just play with cryptocurrency to make some profit. For me cryptocurrency is all about gaining profit and I skip the real world use-cases.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:02:09
Sell all of it
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:22:16
With the hacked money? I would say so.
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:24:33
A new conspiracy theory would be, exchanges are teaming up with hackers so both parties can have profit. Ex: the exchanges creating mini loopholes for hackers to enter in, and take profit and share with the exchange owner etc.

Post your thoughts

Bitcoins purpose is to be a cryptocurrency, an alternative of cash.

Nice stylish watch!
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:32:31
Another realistic approach you could of went with is putting a percentage of income into bitcoin each week or bi-weekly or monthly.
