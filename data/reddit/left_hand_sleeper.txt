"A market correction is a rapid change in the nominal price of a commodity, after a barrier to free trade has been removed and the free market establishes a new equilibrium price."
"A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a significant cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic factors. They often follow speculative stock market bubbles."
Honestly pretty similar.

Pissed! Cuz I should have sold at 100k and bought back at 50k
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:02:55
Oh ya I'm in india. Totally agree.

What if FUD isn't meant to manipulate the market but actually mask the bubble popping??? So, whales have a longer time to get out by creating little fake FUD stories. So we think that this dip is caused by some small news when in reality it's actually the bubble popping.
**Simplier: what if FUD is created to manage market panic?????**

Bill maher is retarded on many fronts. Dude just spews his ignorance sometimes. But he's cool. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:03:56
Wait you think there is only 5 Bill in crypto?? Or that's how much was lost or pulled out?
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:35:32
How many did you have??? Rough esstimate. Not looking forward to this. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:57:31
800b &gt; 350b ... That's a crash ma dude. Maybe not in crypto terms
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:00:21
Hey hey hey!!! CALM DOWN OP!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:09:37
200-300 b when it was 700-800 b
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:30:29
Have you seen the roads there?
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:56:38
These are not subjective terms.
Difference between a crash and a correction is the speed, %, and duration of the downtrend.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:58:21
That will never happen. Someone will  always sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:40:56
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:55:07
Lmao I never understood people that say people will go to crypto to escape the stock crash
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:39:29

Consider this. Coinbase made $1,000,000,000 in  fees last year. And that's just one exchange. 
So I think it's very easy that there has been between 200-300 billion in the market at 800 billion. If not more.
But there is no way of really knowing.
Edit: and how easy it was for that Japanese exchange that was hacked for $500 mill to reimburse the money.
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:45:19
Dude. I was gonna say this. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:26
Hopefully, I think that can happen but only after institutional investors make it normal.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:30:47
Other than satoshi??

He diddles doodles of crocodiles in his spare time. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:36:31
JUMP FAGGOT!
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:25:22
No way. Doesn't make sense. How could coinbase make a billion in fees, if there is only 10-15 billion. I'm guessing 200-300 b.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:13:27
Wait, I thought satoshi had a million btc???
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:27:35
 That doesn't make sense dude. Crypto just went from 800b+ to 400b. Why would they do this???? Why would they go from the stock market to another market where they can loose 50% in a few days???
It's not gonna happen until crypto is mature, if that ever happens.
