You should not tell other people they do not understand economics, you do not seem to understand it either.
you own (HODL) 21mio bitcoin, what gives the value? you?
a transaction gives the value by writing a product with the price you want in btc. 1 Lambo for example 1 btc. that means 1 btc has 1 lambo worth... in fiat $ ~500'000

right and if you pay $40 fee per transaction too.
funny :), blockstream comes from banks and the people who support blockstream mean they are doing something against Banks. Or would you as an AXA boss give someone 55 million, that working against you?

Did you mean that seriously? wtf That's exactly why BTC is destroyed or too expensive for transactions. 
and at the next bullrun again $5-40 for a transaction? so that only the rich can afford it?
btw. nobody needs a node to transfer crypto, just what it costs to make an LN node (if you want to argue with LN now). The Indian goat farmer can safely use this if he earns $ 2 a day.^^ with this block size only rich can afford to use btc

look at where china was 20 years ago, and what will happen in the next 20 years... china is no longer a third world country, they will soon be first world and every chinese wants to live in a house and not in a Slum!  this is foresight, prepare what will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. If you have a company you know what I'm talking about. 
1mb block it's like an Indian street, but it only works as long as there is no rush hour. (these roads were built 30-60 years ago)

you are probably living in a different world than me. In my world, the transactions were almost free until the last 1\-2 years, since then, the fees are constantly rising... and that's just the beginning?
btw. the poor do not need help, they need a fair system. From this one dollar, they may be able to save 20 cents, and these 20 cents are then protected in a btc wallet in satoshis. Now the national currency can lose 90&amp; in value or go bankrupt. but they still have their satoshis on the wallet. 
guys you have to rethink, you can not keep the same system as the banks had, but make it a little better. yes for us it is good that we pay 90&amp; less than a bank transfer, but that still does not help these people! only when the fee is 99.999&amp; lower, 1 cent or less, that helps the poor.

În my eyes, you can not compare gold and bitcoin... everyone has their advantages in their time. If everything works as it is today, Bitcoin is a good alternative to the Fiat money. For some reason everything would be broken (cheap energy, internet, computer) it will be more difficult to trade with bitcoin, then the gold would be a good alternative. everyone would accept a goldcoin for food, medicine, transports in the whole world (like btc today).
in short, btc is the gold currency on the internet, gold of technological advance, gold for crisis times (described above).
you should have both, 50:50. because the chance that you come from a country, where the national currency was already 10 times worthless in the last 100 years, is quite high. the chance that you earn money in good times with btc is very high, as you earn a lot with gold in times of crisis. (after 2ww you got a house for 1oz).

If a currency crashes, that brings always problems with itself, unfortunately btc works only if there are no problems, so in a perfect world!

a currency is characterized by the fact that it is stable, does not lose 50% or increases by 50%. The people hope the price always rises, as with shares. logically the price drops if there are less users or people who have lost the trust.

you should look at how many btc the top 1% have.... you will not believe this!
how many ppl 0.1-1 btc have... 
btw the FBI has over 100'000 btc... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:45:18
This is normal for a share!

look into the financial world (not just the btc world). the richest families have sold over 70% of their petrodollars over the last couple of months and have spent in euro pound and sfr. Why? 
the crisis of 2008 was not fixed, only with more money worsened and now almost 10 years later we get the receipt.

you do not understand it, right? As I said kindergarten stuff, and you confirm this. you will never win a fight with your childish statements. People like you will not win a case against a bitcoin cash supporter. :) 
people like you are the destroyer for btc which i find very bad
ver, bcash..... copy what other people say and repeat it yourself good job.  people like harm more btc with the childish statements than they help something.
btw. i have some btc and 0 bth, zero!!!  keep trying
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:50:35
dude call it bcash, trashcash, vercash, vertrash, vercoin, trashcashcoin what you want, i dont care. 
I'm just saying that you will not win a conversation like that. 
bcash lul hahahahahha 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:36:55
high? wait for the bullrun
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:33:32
They are not against it, it does not make sense that everyone has a note! Does anyone who sends an e-mail have an e-mail server at home?
the mass can not do that... this sub has over 800'000 users, then there would have to be more than 200'000 notes in this short time.
@_date: 2018-04-12 10:42:52
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:57:23
Slowly a little childish the whole, no work? :)
Edit: thanks for the downvotes :), but people you do not understand how to win a war! take an example between Coca Cola and Pepsi, between MC and Burger King .... you do not win, if you want to destroy the opponent (that just makes him much stronger, look at the second world war)^^ YOU MUST HAVE THE BETTER PRODUCT, if you have the better product on the market you will win without wasting energy on the Opponent.... you have to learn a lot! :) 
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:43:19
because banks no longer exest, at least since 2008
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:59:30
gold silver and crypto, I feel safe
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:35:52
without banks!
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:18:09
then you are a liar, kindergarten stuff. 
then go back to fiat money... there are such guys as you.
in crypto you should argue with true arguments... only then will you beat bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:24:40
1/1 confirming
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:25:02


I think so, you do not have to build anything or why is there btc, because it's funny? I mean many do not even understand what btc was made of (not for LN, LN solves only problems)... look at my post above, get downvots because I've been writing for what btc was built.... 
in short, they downvote satoshis vision... makes sense? 
btw you write "we" who is "we"? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:44:42

Invest your time in research, then you find out. btc without AXA ;)
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:07:15
The problem is the mass, that does not interest that. The mass wants to pay quickly and easily. 
think LN wants everyone to have a note, how many of your family own the knowledge to create a note? think how many notes there are and how many users this subreddit has. With more than 800,000 users, there must be over 200,000 notes.
Like apple earlier, they did not have the best products but the easiest to use, and the mass will always choose what is easy to use and does not have to be much effort.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:42:26
because someone does not accept a coin, then he is a hater?
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:57:00
then i have a question... i support btc but always get downvotes when i write that i support satoshi's Vision. why? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:56:05
lol can not even link the right subreddit, but talk about bitcoin and bitcoin cash^^

@_date: 2018-04-27 06:29:26
no from AXA companie
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:56:01










that's exactly what btc should have without LN
Privacy and LN^^
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:36:51
Is the maintenance of these atm's included in the fees?
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:27:27

@_date: 2018-04-27 08:39:35

@_date: 2018-04-17 07:46:36

lul think about your statement ... why is there LN? what is the advantage of LN ... then you can find out if bitcoin cash needs LN.
