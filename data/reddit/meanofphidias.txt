The only low points for me thus far have been recent. 
Gavin and Mike Hearn actually justifying some sort of dictator-type position should be a huge red flag to everyone in this **decentralized** community that Bitcoin is at risk for some form of subversion.
I.e. Monkey Wrench hacking. If we allowed some form of absolute power - Fiat - in the decision making process we instantly centralize Bitcoin and make it vulnerable to meat sack exploits

Yeah, this is a great example of a fundamental misunderstanding of economics.
Miner's mined when bitcoin was at sub pennies and the entire block reward was less than a penny. 
Miners will still mine if bitcoin is at 1M. 
You seem to think this is arithmetic. That somehow their is some imaginary code or law that miners will always receive the same amount of reward. They won't. That's the point. It's not like huge mining farms will spend billions in costs to hold you hostage paying for coffee. They'll shut down if the reward isn't worth the effort. The market will find the equilibrium.
You could honestly be the poster child for what public schools produce.

Increasing the block size is moot and unnecessary at this point. We're talking about the role of the block chain and how the Bitcoin ecosystem works. 
The easiest way to look at it - this is a fork in the philosophy of Bitcoin. Either you consider the block chain isolated and good for only securing Bitcoin transactions and whatever side effects we can squeeze out of that or you consider the block chain a platform with many roles. 
Just increasing the block size is pointless because their is no end to human want. We will find a way to fill blocks regardless of their size and this just puts us on a trajectory for a tragedy of the commons situation. 
Developing ways to build off the protocol enables us to isolate risks on sidechains and further development that way. Want to try some experimental feature? Make a side chain and peg it to Bitcoin. If your idea fails Bitcoin does not care. Today, we would have to introduce the change in Bitcoin and if it fails Bitcoin suffers.

The transformation of the world using a sound currency.
Probably in our lifetimes. Current nation states will go by the wayside like religious organizations/The Monarchy. Some third world or yet undefined digital nation will be like the new "America" and there will be some sort of revolution, albeit violence is unlikely.
States will continue to print their own currencies but future generations will view it like Gen Xer's view arcade tokens. Luddites will continue to serve the state just as they currently serve the church. Governments will still require taxes be paid in their sovereign currencies, however everyone will just convert crypto at the last second before the tax deadline to make a payment. Eventually the state will ask for donations once it can no longer support its military raids with it's monopoly money. 
I can only guess at what will go away, I have no idea what it will be replaced by. Just because I cannot think of the solution does not mean someone else won't.
For those choosing dollar denominations as their metric... The Moon landing is when you denominate things in Bitcoin. It's when people say "A dollar is worth X bitcoin" not "A bitcoin is worth X dollars"

nLockTime ensures a transaction cannot be mined until a certain block height.
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY allows a transaction to be mined but it cannot be spent until a certain block height.
nLockTime allows for the transaction inputs to be spent in the interim between now and the required block height. So, by the time the tx is mined it may be invalid - the tx already spent elsewhere.

CCN Report [Alex Gorale]( asks the question: 
"What happened to the 5800 bitcoin you explicitly mention here:
At the bottom of page 7 of the bitcoin foundation meeting minutes and why should anyone consider you anything but a thief?"
Matonis responds:
"There is no funny business and the story is not much different than the majority of companies maintaining their books in bitcoin during that time period. This is important so I want to answer.
I assume you are referring to $4.6m amount on page 7. This topic was recently covered in depth by Bailey Reutzel for American Banker/PaymentsSource but I will reiterate here (apologies if it doesn't match up exactly). Additionally, this would all be outlined in similar form on the required IRS 990 Form. I don't have exact financial statements in front of me now, but here are some basic points to consider:
a. $4.6m based on March 2nd, 2014 valuation ~$673/BTC because books completed up until that time (of course, if you go back to December 2013, the BTC price was even higher);
b. average Bitcoin Foundation expenses for 2014 of approximately $150k per month;
c. ~90% of assets maintained in BTC as determined by board of directors;
d. Foundation raised in nominal terms approx. $500-650k in membership dues and donations during its existence (price appreciation got us to where we were at the time);
e. January 1, 2015 exchange rate ~$264/BTC
Since my last day on the board of the foundation was December 31st, 2014, that is where my confidential access would terminate. How were the funds allocated is your question, so please allow me to explain (rough ball-park approximation for your benefit because the dates are not exact):
$4.6m (BTC asset valuation on March 2, 2014)
-$1.5m (10-month foundation burn rate at avg $150k/mo)
-$2.5m (approx. foreign exchange loss from BTC assets during period)
=$0.6m (balance remaining at Bitcoin Foundation on January 1, 2015)"
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:36:53
It would take as long as it would take to broadcast the transactions. 
The out counter is a varint 1-9 bytes. So, a tx could have ~~9,223,372,036,854,775,807~~ 1.84467440737E+19 outputs. I would want someone to verify that as I have never tested it.
But, if we still used our ball parked 100 bits for an output that works out to, like, 115 exabytes?
So, I guess, if you really wanted to you could have 1 tx with 7 trillion outputs. That single transaction would be 700 terabytes.
The original poster likely did such:
86400 * 7 = 604800 possible transactions can be **mined** each day, theoretically.
7000000000 / 604,800 t/d = 11,574 days
11,574 days / 365 = ~32 years. 
OP is correct that it would 32 years to mine a single transaction for every human being on the planet. However, it would not take one transaction per person to accomplish that. Furthermore, the transactions would need to be sustained as I doubt any node or mining operating has enough memory/swap to store that many transactions. Also, they would all sit with 0 confirmations and any new transactions would need to include a mining fee greater than whatever we broadcast.
Me being pedantic is more frustration with the echo chamber this sub is now. Folks act like the 7tps thing is a garden hose. 9 tps would break it! Wrong. It's more like the network operates like a reservoir, or dam, that collects transactions. Every 10 minutes a block's worth of water is released from the dam. 
Miners decide for themselves how to maintain their dams
Edit: Correcting my VI stuff. 1 Byte to say how many bytes the VI is. So 8 bytes, not 9

@_date: 2015-06-25 21:56:47
Have you ever done a transaction? I'm seriously asking because the 0 conf debate happened a couple years ago and somewhere on the Bitpay blog they explained how they do it.
It's almost exactly how I described it. Furthermore, it helps if you understand the kinds of double spends and how they may be effected.
Edit: Also, yes, I have no problem accepting zero confirmation transactions as valid a couple seconds after they are broadcast. 
Even six confirmations is arbitrary - sort of. The probability of a miner secretly mining 6 blocks before the rest of the network mines 1 is extremely low. That's what it would take to reverse a 6 conf. Again, the effort and resources that goes into a double spend at the miner level is extremely expensive and blatantly obvious as the input used to pay you will just be in another tx in that block. Making it obvious what happened

"Because Moore's Law" is not the answer. That's really funny though, thank you for that.
There is a fundamental problem of whether Bitcoin handles every transaction from a cup of coffee up to multi-billion dollar transactions, in addition does it handle notarizing contracts? Does it handle land ownership? Should we be recorded GPS coordinates in the block chain in addition to transaction information and full contracts?
The answer is no. There is no need. It's far better and more **robust** to leave Bitcoin be Bitcoin and let other services build out those features while leaving Bitcoin the backbone provider to all of those things.
Sort of like how TCP is an underlying protocol but all those nice things like the internet run on top of it.

Yeah, so how about hitting us with some computer science other than "Yeah we can scale this"
Please, explain it. Just because something works at once size does not mean it works at all sizes. The best strategy forward is making Bitcoin a backbone for all cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency services and decentralizing the features to other systems.
There is zero reason for the notary functions of Bitcoin to fail because something is messed up something related to multisig. There is no reason for the any single feature to interfere with any other and decentralizing Bitcoin is the answer. 
Basically, you are arguing that "There are things in the world that make toast so Bitcoin has to be able to make toast"

Which is the entire point of a sidechain. Encapsulate a few thousand or million transactions in a single transaction that is actually sent to the Bitcoin block chain. 
It's called a protocol for a reason. You build a stack to supplant the protocol. Instead of designing a massive monolithic system you making many smaller, decentralized, parts and they have interoperability. 
The proposal of making Bitcoin into this massive *thing* that does everything will ensure Bitcoin is good at nothing.

Not true and you fundamentally don't understand the point.
I can do 50,000,000,000,000,000 transactions on my own platform or another completely separate cryptocurrency and I can put 1 transaction in Bitcoin's block chain that validates and notarizes them all. It even runs on the same exact concept Bitcoin's block chain runs on.
And if something on my service or the separate service breaks Bitcoin is completely unaffected. There is zero reason to couple Bitcoin to all these services and that's what you lemmings continuously propose day in and day out because you're all fucking morons. 
Make the block size 100 TB, who fucking cares. There is no end to human demand. We will find a way to fill them regardless of the size. The point is the system is untenable if you just keep tacking bullshit on. It's not a solution.

@_date: 2015-06-08 21:19:33
Because multiple outputs still relies on the space requirements and the transaction pool =/= throughput despite what the lemmings on this board solipsize.
Edit: Better explanation in a sec
A Bitcoin transaction is basically two lists. Inputs and outputs, there's a version and some bits that tell you how many inputs/outputs there are and a lock time. Forget lock time for now.
Every Input is a previous Output. Sounds weird, right?
When bitcoin are mined the Input of the transaction is usually blank, it can be anything, but usually it is blank. This is called the Coinbase. The Output for the Coinbase transaction is the block reward + unspent tx inputs. I can include as many outputs in my transaction as I have bitcoin in my inputs. Theoretically. 
In fact, 99.9% of transactions do this. Whenever you send someone coins you likely include multiple outputs - change outputs are the most common. E.g. you send me 1 bitcoin but previously received .5 and .75 bitcoin. Your transaction must combine those inputs for a total of 1.25 bitcoin. You tx will have two outputs: 1 to my address and ~.25 to an address your wallet will generate and you control. In this way, you give yourself change.
The only limit are size constraints and available bitcoin from your inputs. So, theoretically, 1 input could have thousands of outputs. 
However, each output would take about 'many bytes.' Back of the napkin, let's say each output is 100 bytes. Most of it is in the Script. An output script is a Turing incomplete 'code' that has the requirements for unlocking the bitcoin - i.e. using them as inputs in a future transaction. So since outputs have a physical byte size they are also constrained by the size of the blocks. Also, that a large transaction will likely be refused by the miners.
Second part,
Bitcoin can handle many thousands of tx per second. The 7 TPS theoretical speed comes from a basic transaction being ~215 bytes (Actually larger) but each block is about 1MiB (really 750 kb). 1 MiB / 215 bytes = 4,878 transactions. The average block time is ten minutes.
4878 / 600 seconds = about 8.
Like I said, txs are not that small and the miners usually set the block size to around 750KiB
3658 / 600 = 6.09 tx per second. 
We can broadcast many, many more txs at a much faster rate - it happens, actually. The 7Tps thing is sustained. Even if it goes higher, miners have an in-memory pool where they keep transactions. If a miner does not include a tx in a block it remains in the pool. If we did, says, 9 tx per second at the theoretical 215 tx size for ten minutes the next block would likely contain the last 1/3 of those tx that were broadcast before the previous block were mined. They would stay at 0 confirmations during this time. 
To get rid of that tx you would have to mine a different transaction to a block that uses the same inputs - thus voiding the first tx in the pool (This is a known attack called a block witholding attack) or turn off every node running on the network that has a copy of that tx. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:46:10
No. You do not understand economics.
You are literally playing with finding the tipping point between "Only the top X% of storage/bandwidth/hardware performance will be able to keep up" and "We need to figure out the microtransactions Satoshi originally talked about when he shared his view that most transactions would occur off-chain"
No one knows what the number is that you are looking for, only the market does. The proposal to increase the size is reckless, dangerous and could destroy the entire infrastructure. The latter has been vetted and is supported by 95% of core developers (Gavin was the only one I knew of supporting his increase, Hearn is not a core dev) over the proposed increase.

I think that off-chain transaction technology, like two way pegs, sidechains, the lightning network, etc are how Bitcoin will scale. Maybe not those exact techs but it will be impossible for a megalithic Bitcoin to exist.
For Bitcoin to survive it must remain simple. Furthermore, intertwining Bitcoin as the 'parent' of other chains makes Bitcoin the underlying protocol of cryptocurrency in general - not just a cryptocurrency. 
Also, not all features need to be in Bitcoin. There is no reason for Bitcoin to notarize 500,000 documents in a given day. There are plenty of opportunities for notary services to exist that aggregate their records in a singular block chain transaction, however. This still allows for competition, innovation and scaling. Effectively, this strategy gives the same effect without changing or putting Bitcoin at risk.
Additionally, intertwining cryptocurrencies and moving transactions off-chain turns Bitcoin into it's own exchange. Effectively, it would function as a fully auditable reserve currency of every other system that pegs/meshes with it. It would make currency exchanges irrelevant, laundering stolen funds becomes more difficult - at least the audit trail between currencies now exists, and, again, strengthens Bitcoin's position as the backbone network of **all** cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:24:52
Not at all. Services that accept 0 conf transactions usually monitor the 'most connected' nodes in the network. 
There is an extremely high probability the tx has reached the majority of the network once it passes through those nodes, thus nigh impossible to double spend. That's how they do it.
Beyond that, the risk would involve mining. That's very, very expensive and very very obvious.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:37:08
Step 1: Take the current block hash of any other p2p currency
Step 2: Generate a Bitcoin private key from that hash. 
Step 3: Send some dust to the corresponding address
You've just notarized every block and transaction on that network in the Bitcoin block chain and it cost you dust + tx fee. 


So what? Where are they now? Where have they been since 2009? Who cares? This is called a reward and its for early adopters. The rest of the world is free to clone Bitcoin and start something better. That's how the world works. 
Only communist and morons want ubiquitous participation and you are usually too busy wiping the drool off your chins to see that all you accomplish is making something worse so that the lowest common denominator won't use it anyway or they just abuse it. 
If you want larger blocks make a new coin. Nothing is stopping you.

My thoughts:
Even if Google, Amazon, Apple and whomever else you name threw a parade to announce they were all going to be accepting and holding Bitcoin no one other than us would care.
Bitcoin is going to do well because people managing fiat currencies are failures. Bitcoin isn't a neat way to spend money online. That's just been the focus of the past year or so. 
Bitcoin protects you from fiat. That is the main use case for Bitcoin. 
All these companies very much enjoy their soft, cushioned positions at the top of the food chain. They are net companies but they exist in legal frameworks and only there.

You're fine to do that. I would never force someone to participate in my ideology, in fact anyone who would is no longer practicing it. But, you claim private property was stolen from the commons - was my body stolen from the commons? Did some collective possess the ability to control my body, move my limbs and choose what I like for me? Of course not. A human beings body is innately, naturally, private property owned by a single mind. 
Furthermore, you propose that the commons is something capable of ownership. If one individual does not have a right/power/etc how can they give it to someone else. My question being, if one person alone cannot own the commons then how can a group of people come together and become endowed with the ability to own the commons? Of course, under your definition I'm sure the wording you use is "share the commons"
Ultimately, the commons are flawed and the argument has been defeated for quite some time. Freeing resources from the commons opened up entire generations of wealth and spurred incredible advances in the standard of living for thousands of people. 
All of those private services are completely optional. There is no requirement that they exist. Certainly there is no reason why they couldn't be entirely defensive if they did but that's up to the buyer and seller to decide for themselves, not you or I. Unlike your ideal world, though, mine is not a utopia. Bad things happen. That's reality.


Oh yeah? So when I hire 100 people to work for me and I pay them substantially less than what I make, because I'm the business owner, what happens to me in your world? If I take a piece of land and work it myself and refuse to let anyone else work on the land what happens to me then? 
What if I go the other way and entirely embrace your ideals. What if I try to force myself on you because there is no private property. You have no claim of sovereignty to your body - it is not private property, it belongs to the commons. When I try to take what I want from you what is your argument then?


Oh no, it's definitely anarcho socialism and a re-branding effort as well as oxymoron. You think just because Chomsky drops it that it suddenly becomes accurate. You really don't have an economic model. But here, let me recommend some books to you. Maybe it'll help you out once you get out of high school
"That Which is Seen and Unseen" would help you out. 
"Man, Economy and State" is probably a little much for you but give it a go: 
"The Denationalization of Money" this is a good one explaining what's coming up with cryptocurrency in general: 
Really, just trim the link to everyone before "...books/" and there's an entire free library! Brought to by capitalism! Like this internet connection you have right now =) (and most other public libraries and useful public resources in America as they are typically donated by entrepreneurs when they die or funded by donations)
You're flawed because you see your desire to change the current system as anarchic. All you want to do is replace it with one of your own design - it's OK to have a state so long as **you** agree with what the state does. Which is absolutely no different than how it is today, except someone else agrees with what it is doing and you do not. At best, maybe that's revolutionary but it certainly isn't anarcho-anything to switch out the old tyrant for a new one.

You are a minority. This thing that happened to you is important to you because it has happened to you. If you want to start something that appeals to your audience you should go and do that. It is my understanding that the goal of this post, in this thread, where this conversation is taking place has very little to do with your point. 
If it was a Venn Diagram your point would be inside the circle but it would be a very very small part of the circle. Even though you seem to feel as though it would be a very large part of the circle, it would not be. 
Kind of like when you are at work and you have a one hour meeting to address a large issue and there's that one guy/gal who wants to spend 45 minutes of the meeting talking to a minor detail that won't solve what everyone else is in the room to solve. Mostly because it only affects them and they have a hard time understanding that there are other people who are affected by the outcome.

Read it again.
I'm broadcasting both together to all the nodes I am connected to. Tx1 will be referenced in Tx2 at almost the exact same time. No one else on the network will know about Tx1 until it is broadcast through the nodes. Tx2 will follow it immediately. It has nothing to do with how many nodes you are connected to. No one would be able to reference Tx1's hash until they receive the broadcast. 
Unless you've come up with a magical device that can predict what other people are going to do you have no hope in hell of setting up a node that will recognize what is happening within the amount of time you would have available. Further you would need all the other nodes to collude with you not to broadcast my second tx.
By the time a bot could put together the tx using inputs from tx1 tx2 will probably already have completely propagated the network
Edit: We are specifically talking about this part of the protocol
 For each input, if the referenced output exists in any other tx in the pool, reject this transaction.[5] 
"↑ Note that this is not a hard requirement on clients. The network-enforced rule is that only one transaction spending a particular output can be in the blockchain, thus preventing double-spending. Technically miners can choose which one they want to put into the block they're working on as long as no other transaction has spent that output either previously in the blockchain, or in the same block. The in-memory transaction pool can technically be managed in whatever way the miner is willing to implement."
So no. You would need 51% of the network to deny my second transaction that the entire rest of the network would already have and acknowledge in their tx pools.
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:19:16

Either you are appealing to history as an authority on your definition of property (rather, appealing to Proudhon) or you are choosing an argument tailored by Proudhon against a very specific definition of property under **Roman Law**:


Of course, since Rome has fallen there have been others who have thoughts on what constitutes property. How brave of Proudhon, in the 1870's, to address the concerns of socialist Romans. Maybe he could have shared thoughts on, oh I don't know, Locke, Thomas Acquinas, Hobbes, Bastiat - or shit how about property as it was originally laid out in The Constitution - "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Property."
It's easy for leftists to convince people of their arguments when they get to arbitrarily define terms for the opposition.

Just an FYI PhinnaeusGage/Gleb Gamow are shill accounts from known scammers. These accounts are the same person, though. So the person who posted in the Bitcointalk thread is the same person posting this here now.
He and his clan do things like this frequently to disrupt the market. Just browse the securities forum or their post history on Bitcointalk. This is very untrustworthy.
Edit: Link to those interested: 
I believe that is the post where Gleb / Gage threatened to take someone out back and "F them in the ass in front of his Abe Lincoln totem pole" Dude has some serious damage.
This was a company that was trying to raise funds to buy more product to sell in their online store. To drive the price down Gleb and his minions trolled, doxxed and spread FUD until after the IPO closed and then declared "peace" after trashing a company that ran well for over a year - one of the original LTCGlobal companies. 
Also, I have a reliable source saying this was not the USMS. I cannot confirm it so we will have to wait to see on that one.
Edit: Here is another link to the thread that links Gleb to Phinneaus Gage: 
He had to abandon that account because of all the scams. One person was unrelenting and he was forced to settle with them. He continues to scam as Gleb, IPO Magic, RiverboatBTC, and a couple others.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. Human beings give things value. That value is based on trade. 
Further, you are mish mashing utility with value but telling me only certain types of utility actually have value.

No. This is false. 51% just gives you your own fork moving forward. It would take all of a few minutes for people to figure out what was going on. It does not change the history this is why the network can recover from a 51% and self-correct.

The price isn't tied to the dollar.
It's measured in USD because that's common, people know that. If the dollar collapses BTC doesn't go down. It means the USD part of BTC/USD is going to go up.
For easy math, If .001 BTC is $1 and enough to buy a candy bar now and the dollar collapses and suddenly Candy Bars cost $10 that just means .001 BTC is now worth $10 and can still buy a candy bar.
However, in the event of a collapse a lot more will be going on. It's more likely that the relationship between BTC/USD will change even more. E.g bitcoin's buying power will go up. So it could also be possible that .0008 is enough for the same candy bar. 
The one thing that absolutely would not happen is the price of the candy bar rising relative to Bitcoin. It would not cost .01 to buy it now. This is why Bitcoin is not tied to the dollar. 
EDIT: The only distant reason I could see the value of a candy bar rise relative to bitcoin in this scenario is if the manufacturing/transportation/etc costs that go in to its production were to also rise due to the dollar collapse, but even then it has nothing to do with BTC being pegged to the dollar
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:20:57
It certainly doesn't make that redundant. You are still trying to apply Keynesian rules to an Austrian setting. 
You are trying to say that the value of the currency would be greater than the return on investment. That would make individuals very conservative about how they spend. Not eliminate spending. You are mistaking our current situation of "I have to spend this shit currency as fast as possible or it might be worthless tomorrow" with "Inflation stimulates the economy" when in reality it's more like "Investing during inflation is a mass scramble to maintain your level of wealth."
Deflation is a good thing. What a damn miracle it is, that if no one in the economy is able to start a business that will succeed people will still preserve and perhaps gain more wealth on the principles of the currency alone. It doesn't make it set in stone, however. In fact, if my 1 BTC is worth 1 million today and suddenly it becomes worth 10 million tomorrow I can afford my identical standard of living and now I have another 9 million to do whatever I want with. I can increase my standard of living, I can take bigger risks on my investment. 
You continually ignore the reality of the situation. If the total wealth in existence is going up that is a good thing. You're inflationary model destroys wealth.

Yes, they were liberated from people who were not intelligent enough to secure their own fortunes/savings. Outside of disrespecting and neglecting your own body the destruction of wealth, particularly your own wealth, is one of the worst things you can do in your short time on our tiny blue dot. 
Truthfully, how many of them would it have taken to expose Gox sooner if they were protecting themselves and withdrawing? Who can say, but perhaps if the insolvency had become known sooner fewer of this community would have stupid'd themselves out their savings?
Furthermore, it shows in it's entirety how big of an education campaign is needed not just for Bitcoin but to prepare people for free markets. The biggest tragedy to come out of the Gox crisis is not the business failure. It's the realization that a significant portion of the people who participate in this community would be better off sitting it out on the sidelines until we've dumbed it down enough for them to handle it. What I'm saying is Bitcoin 3.0 needs to be the "bumper bowling" version of Bitcoin where everyone bowls a strike in spite of their own best efforts otherwise.

The price wouldn't drop if people were doing that. In fact, the price would go up if fewer bitcoin were available on the exchanges for people to trade.

This is wrong because shitty businesses that fail are a good thing. Free up that space in the market for someone else to try who won't fail.
If your business fails it should fail as soon as possible and minimize the total impact. If Gox does not fail they won't change. They will continue onward doing what they've been doing and only cause further harm down the line.
This is equivalent to "Why you should hope Big Banks don't fail"
The worst case is Gox is insolvent. That's it. That's the absolute worst thing to come out of this. Compared to what the world has seen of late that is a God Damn Miracle and you should just relax and let the market take care of it.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:36:31
Yeah that's a classic allacy. 
You assume that because one person is rich that it another must be poor - or that there exists a finite amount of wealth possible. It's the same argument the labor market tries to use to fit their narrative, as if there is a finite amount of labor humans need to perform.
In reality, those people who "Would have so much money they would not know what to do with it" would spend that wealth. They would maintain their status, but they would absolutely be spending. How much doesn't matter. 
Inflation just outright destroys that wealth and lowers everyone's standard of living. Effectively, Keynesian economics is a system that spites individuals for doing well and instead of leaving people along forces everyone to become equally poor.

Well, that's just not true. The establishment changes throughout history. Granted it takes place on a scale much longer than one human life so it's easy to think the US establishment has been around forever and will always be around forever.
Rome bled out slow like we're doing. Theocracy used to be all the craze in Europe. Monarchy. Republics and Democracies. Shit communism and socialism even had a chance to fail a few dozen times or so.
The one constant in history is that human beings experience periods of radical change whereby they obtain more freedom and liberty than they had before. A new establishment is created and slowly the freedom and liberty rescinds but just like the charts we see of the Bitcoin bubbles each time humanity bounces back and we're better off in the longer run.
I agree with everything else you said. I don't want to communicate that I think the government will just shut off like a light switch. I think they'll exist like churches do now. Effectively moot and the next "establishment" will regulate/control them or just be higher on the food chain. It will be a minor, perhaps optional, part of our lives (well not us, probably but future generations).
I think eventually the establishment will be so decentralized that each individual person will be their own authority but I don't think that will happen in our lifetimes.

HFC as I understand it relies on two things
* geographic location
* having elevated privileges over other users
* very high bandwidth/speed
The geographic location comes in to play because HFC trader bots are looking in to the stock buy/sell queues and inserting their buy/sell orders ahead of other users. The location is important because we are dealing with nanoseconds.
E.g. it takes 7 nanoseconds for a normal person to buy stock. It will sit in the buy queue for 3 nanoseconds. In that 3 nanosecond window the HFC bot must read the order, run some metric to see if it can make a profit trading before it and if so insert it's own order in the queue just ahead of where the normal user's order is.
I don't think this would be applicable in a decentralized form. Although I  have to admit to not taking the time to understand Counterparty's system. Maybe someone else can help with that part.

They don't actually come close to 51%.
the charts on blockchain.info are made based on who is mining the blocks.
This is why you see the "rounds" of 51% warnings, statistically there will be days when folks at 30% will mine 6 blocks in a row, or more blocks throughout the day than other large mining pools. 
There really aren't huge swings in miners jumping pools. It's just a little esoteric math. It's really funny to watch everyone get worked up though

I have three things:
1.) A priv/pub keypair
2.) A passphrase
3.) A password to decrypt the wallet. 
After I unlock my wallet and provide the passphrase my wallet software generates key pairs like such:
SHA256(privkey + passphrase + pubkey + index) Index can be anything but let's assume it keeps a key pool from 0 - 99. 
You can keylog my wallet key and my passphrase but without my private/public keypair that wraps my passphrase it won't matter. Now if you get a copy of my wallet that's different. You'd have the passphrase and the password/phrase to unlock the wallet and you could pull the key pair or use the wallet on comparable Bitcoin software.
I'm not aware of any wallets that do this yet but it was detailed in one of the BIPS I think.
Another added advantage of this is being able to reclaim keys. E.g. you are using a wallet that holds keypairs at index 99 and 17 from the formula I mentioned. If you lose that wallet but still have all the data used to to generate the pairs you are fine.

Pittsburgh's Mellon Park took over a year to repair. It sat like a scar downtown the entire time. Occupy came in, built their tent city. Destroyed the park and then left all their trash there, human waste included.
It had to be completely destroyed and rebuilt afterwards. It only recently opened, as it was kept closed during the process.
But nothing excuses the intolerance they displayed. Their problems were the result of the political system and the laws they create. Corporations and lobbyists are just playing the game, Washington decides what the game is.

This is entirely subjective. If anyone were king for a day they would push their agenda. Whether or not people agree with them or how many people agree has absolutely zero bearing on "right" or "wrong"
You should be free to draw your line, for yourself, where you choose. You have no authority to decide for other people where that line is. 


In regular theft the thief does not stay in my home and tell me what kinds of food I can or cannot eat or who I can or cannot marry. They don't force me to fill out self-incriminating tax documents before stealing from me and the thief will likely only take enough from me to be an inconvenience. Government doesn't care if what they take shuts down my business.
You've done nothing to show how laws against money laundering prohibit theft.


I don't think you understand property rights beyond how to drop them in conversation. Obviously hiring a contract killer, like thievery, infringes on my property. While I have nothing against the hit man doing their job I'm sure they would understand the risks they take.
But let's take the absolute worst case - you hire a thug. A pure, brutal thug, whose only joy is hurting people. He does it cheap and mostly for the pleasure of it. Regardless of whether we have an anarcho society or the one we currently live in this person will exist. Institutionalizing them and calling them police officers or giving them rank in military doesn't change this. 
Truthfully, you already do this with tax dollars. You're just killing people who have a different skin color from you and their in another country. So I don't know why the onus is on me to prove to you that my system would be better just because it happens to have the exact same thing yours does (albeit, on a much smaller scale)


Apparently not. Eight year old prostitution is a thing. A few cases? You've got to be kidding.


You've done absolutely nothing to show that. You've just said "Hur dur this is bad mmmkay and money laundering laws mkkay are good. Good stops bad mmkay."
The reality is these crimes will always exist for as long as human beings exist. You are trying to show that when the punishment is steep enough prohibition works. And it is completely wrong. 
Your argument isn't about money laundering law. It's about prohibition. You're attempting to say "Money Laundering law helps enforce prohibition." And you are dead wrong.

The incredible amount of education and effort it takes to get someone interested in Bitcoin to become knowledgeable about Bitcoin.
It's not just understanding technology. You have to teach people economics, monetary policy, voluntarism. Essentially you have to rebuild their entire perspective on how the world works. Most folks never even ask those questions or are too insecure and stubborn to leave their bullshit political dichotomy at the door. 
That's why we have morons on both sides saying "Hey you know what would be really great? Regulation. If Government made sure everyone was linked to an issued address and could tax the shit out of Bitcoin it would be so much better! Everyone would use it!"

Because that is exactly what we are talking about, this entire conversation.


Let me trim the euphemism and bullshit from that.
"Inflation incentivizes people to purchase because the money is losing value by the second."


This is complete bullshit. If I did work in 1920 for one fiat dollar it has lost it's buying power by about 95% since then. Inflation does the exact opposite of what you are claiming it does.


Yes, inflation does raise the price of necessities and drives non-necessities out of business. Re-read that part where I kept harping on "Inflation lowers the standard of living"


What the fuck are you talking about? You are literally saying "Instead of having a healthy, functioning economy it's better to just crush any small gains made by the poor and completely eliminate any hope they ever have of acquiring any form of wealth."

Rights, if any, are derived simply by nature. Some people like to use the word creator to be more accepting. When they use that term it's a blanket statement meaning "Whether you mean the universe, nature, a God, whatever, somehow through our circumstance as human beings..." 
You have a right to self-ownership. You are the only mind in your body. Only you control your own actions. Only you are responsible for your actions. Everything else stems from that notion. It's called property rights.


No they are not. You are talking about something called governance. Where a group of people organize and form an agreement where they decide what is OK and not OK in their society. This has absolutely nothing to do with rights.


I guess some people are more comfortable being cared for by people in government who they've never met. I am totally ok with you doing that.

Comparing the bitcoin network to the middle man (a bank) is like saying a walk to your refrigerator is the middle man to getting a snack. 
In a decade or two or maybe in a hundred years we will have the standard of living to say the network is a middle man in the sense that today's banks are. Kudos on the skepticism required to be that forward thinking but compared to the present system it is trivial.
 &gt;This is reasonably true, except for double spends
This is a risk and legitimate. It does have a preventative measure in place already - this is why so many places wait for X confirmations. It is a risk you get to decide for yourself and, with the exception of a 51% attack or some derivative of a 51% attack, is at worst trivial as a solution has been found by the market.
I consider this benign as it's more of an implementation issue on the provider end. You can be safe, if you choose not to be it's your fault.


Nothing stops a fractional reserve banking system for gold either, or for turnips, or flowers or really well-thought ideas. How does OP know that someone couldn't implement a FRB of bitcoin and have it be a huge success? In fact, in a competitive market FRB would be nothing like the present system. 
But to OPs point - no one can inflate bitcoin. OP is talking about an abstracted currency backed by Bitcoin that would be corrupted in this manner. Therefore, in respect to bitcoin, this is absurd and benign


And this is neither benign nor trivial but utter bullshit. It's your damn money. It's no one elses responsibility to ensure you are not ripped off. It places responsibility exactly where it belongs. 
OP also ignores that I have, as a consumer, the absolute knowledge of sending payment. I can call Paypal and say "Where is my bank transfer?" and they can say "Ask your bank" and when I call my bank they can say "Check Paypal." There is no runaround. I paid you. It is binary.

Just because what Bitcoin is makes you feel better emotionally than why Bitcoin "is" does not make your 2 bits important, relevant or in context.
In other words, we're discussing the roots of Bitcoin. You are talking about the limbs and branches.

Well thank you government for being a necessary obstacle. Who knows what we would do if Coinbase didn't have to jump through this pointless hurdle.
Thank you again government for providing us with all these unecessary holdups that entrench shitty companies. Way to go Elizabeth. Maybe you should reference her own words in the article where she speaks about her connections...
"While I was working on Capitol Hill for a congressman, I started to see firsthand how many uphill battles there are within the current system in the US. My boss was and still is a phenomenal man with integrity who is truly working for the betterment of his constituents. However, after I learned about Bitcoin, it became clearer to me that one can almost be more effective outside of the system with a technology like Bitcoin. Bitcoin alleviates the middle-man effect, works around red tape and additionally meets the financial and liberty needs of individuals on a global level."
There is no better way for a lobbyist to demonstrate exactly how full of shit they are other than this way.
By the way, are you sleeping with this chick or something? The vitriol has certainly been entertaining.
Well it certainly is wonderful to know that Coinbase's arm is being twisted to make sure they enforce the government's rules that prevent people from keeping the money they earn. Way to go government again! All you've done is give three reasons why the foundation needs to fuck off and the rest of us should continue to ignore legislation as per usual. 


Wow look at that. More government bullshit! Hey, someone should form a foundation so the government can write even more fucked up shit to do so we get to keep jumping through pointless hoops instead of offering things people actually care about!


Please fucking don't. I've read a lot of shit from people beholden to whatever authority they happened to be born under. You, by far, worship your wise and benevolent rulers more than most of them.

I approve of the round table and voluntary efforts. You should not be forced to throttle your success because a large number of people who are not as successful refuse to do anything other than complain. 
I would argue that the spirit of Bitcoin was to be successful in spite of the people who tell you otherwise or cry "fair" or for some reason think that you are beholden to them.
These people bitching, fuck them. Either they are incapable of providing anything of value to help the situation and are therefore useless and opinion moot or they can and they choose to bitch and moan instead and are as much or more unworthy of anyone's attention.
Every solution brings new problems to light. This is just another one of them for Bitcoin. If everyone did what these folks do, the ones who bitch, we'd never even have Bitcoin. 
The key to solving this problem does not lie in hobbling other people so that they may move as slowly as the least common denominators. It lies in getting those who can innovate and bring ideas to reality the tools they need to succeed.

@_date: 2014-09-18 18:43:52
Yes, because using satoshis and converting to bitcoins is so much more sophisticated a transformformation than **using floats to represent financial data**
If you can find 1 example of a best practice published anywhere that says "Use floats to represent currency values" by any of any repute I will send you some bitcoin. 
Your problem is you don't understand how the matissa and exponent affect the mathematics. If you use floats for bitcoins you start hitting problems when the units are around 12 digits away from each other.
For example, if you have 1,000 BTC and you do the floating point math to update your balance after I send you 1 satoshi your balance will still read 1,000 BTC. 
Regardless, you'll find that if you actually read that ambiguous library you allude to it's just introducing additional computational overhead to account to precision issues in floating point arithmetic. So it doesn't matter if you know a library that can do what you claim it does with floats. The runtime is still going to be greater because the machine has to do extra work **every single time** you do any addition/subtraction

No. 
Fiat has value because it is used around the world, recognized by people for what it is, enforced by the US military and for it's monetary policy. Basically everything about it gives/takes away value in the eyes of the beholders. Yes the Government using the military to force countries to continue using it contributes to its value. But not in the literal sense that government says "1 Dollar will buy a loaf of bread."
Democracies are a farce. They are dictatorships. Anarchists, Libertarians and anyone else who loves freedom is for bitcoin because those are the principles upon which it was built.
Bitcoin has value for the same reasons that fiat money has value. It just employs them differently and needs no army to coerce anyone. Even if you don't think the adoption, recognition and monetary policy of Bitcoin is that good that is fine. It's mostly because everyone else is so bad that Bitcoin will be successful.

No, a free market does not exist because of regulation. That is an oxymoron. 
The market you have in the United States - or anywhere else in the world, is a regulated market. 
if you like politicians inflating your currency, if you like funding wars, if you like having no say in how much they take from you go back to your regulated market. If you think the positives outweigh the negatives of the free market stay there.
The promise of the free market is that it gets better over time and innovates incredibly quickly. I am not beholden to anyone who lost coins on Gox. Maybe you like bailing people out.
The thing everyone seems to forget is that these consumer protections are typically paid for twice over due to their overhead in government. Effectively you are being conned to be safe from being conned.

You say it isn't inherently stupid to ask for regulation without knowing what you're going to get but that's exactly how we got here. 


That's not how multisig works and it wasn't available when Gox was purchased and converted to a Bitcoin exchange. The purpose of Bitcoin is being free to succeed and fail without permission. Asking a bank for permission removes the point.
If it really is beneficial to ask a bank permission why havent you started your own exchange? You'd be rich, right? People would flock to your service.


See what I posted first. A minority of people expressed a desire for regulatory clarity and they ended up with crippling legislation. Yay! See it's good to ask without specifying what you want!

This was relevant to my topic about statism.
I get your point. Most of us get your point. Most of us hear your point every time we talk to anyone who is not an AnCap. 
What you are talking about has more in common with a software fork. 
Bitcoin as it was invented and as it exists today is AnCap. Hypothetically, a socialist could invent their own spin on Bitcoin. They could rework the protocol somehow to represent their ideals (Block reward is evenly split somehow?). They could make their own competing coin. 
Regardless, the more compromises to those core AnCap ideals there are the less of Bitcoin it is. I would say the more perverted it becomes. The truer Bitcoin sticks to its AnCap foundation the better it would do. 
Likewise, spin off coins will fail compared to Bitcoin (And Bitcoin itself if it compromises those AnCap ideals) unless it can offer something Bitcoin doesn't. The only way to win against an embodiment of pure capitalism is creating an even bigger, better version of it or violence.

The buying power of fiat is still constrained to the same laws of supply and demand everything else is. If the money supply is increased without an increase in demand for fiat it lowers the buying power of all those bills in circulation.
You're assumption is that the government has the ability to direct the increases in the money supply in such a way that it generates more demand/faith in that currency to bring the buying power back up. 
Effectively it's a gamble. That's why the money is giving to banks and corporations - the increase in money supply "trickles out". The first people who spend it do so with the full buying power of those dollars, it's not until reaching circulation that the newly created currency fully effects the economy. 
Your argument is that government can print money and take a risk investing in business/policy and get a return on every dollar that is higher than each dollar going in. To date, no economist, mathematician or scientist has ever been able to show how government can increase the value of the dollar.
If Quantitative Easing did indeed work there would be cause for someone to say "Why not give government 100% control of all dollars and let them spend everyone's money for them." But it does not work. 
So the only thing left in QE vs counterfeiting is really who spends it. With QE you have some person spending other people's money on other people. That's the least responsible way of spending money. With counterfeiting you have some person spending other people's money on themselves. That's next the next to worst way of spending money. 
Given that QE is so much more drastic than counterfeiting [here](
Approximately $40 million counterfeit bills were in circulation in 2002. Counterfeiters could do this every year and still not come close to the single trillion dollar bailout. 
Still want to see the world in black and white? Go back to FOX/MSNBC and begging your politicians for your freedom.

The original convo did not involve you. You butted in with something completely irrelevant to the conversation. Normally people start new threads for that. 
All your bullshit about who contributes value missed the point of what I said entirely and I explained it to you already but you won't let go of the paltry reality you've created for yourself. 
Get off the internet and go get yourself some help
Edit: If you think Howard Zinn offered anything of value to anyone it just further proves my point. The man accomplished nothing with his life other than inspiring other people to do nothing with their lives. His entire life was a sham and bag of hot air. Idiots like you find him compelling because you never bothered reading a book outside what was prescribed to you growing up. Look at the harm that idiot actor that grew up next door to him is doing every day. Proof by induction that Zinn's life stole more from the world and left a legacy of grifters that he was able to put back.
Zinn presenting limited perspectives in accordance with his bias must have really blown your mind. In reality there aren't "three levels of understanding" that's complete made up bullshit. People fill entire spectrums of knowledge and life is about reconciling your interests with the world around you. 
And originally it was an Eleanor Roosevelt quote and it went along the lines of:
"Big minds talk about ideas"
"Medium Minds talk about events"
"Small minds talk about people"
My point is that libertarian ideals are the only things that ever did a lick of good for anyone in this country without first requiring bringing harm to other people. Now that I have finally outright told you my point maybe you can go back through all your bullshit dialog and explain how your bullshit fiction addresses any of that without having to use entire paragraphs to explain yourself. 
Oh, sorry that probably doesn't fit in to one of the three levels you are capable of understanding in your narrow, western public school upbringing. Really thinking like a 1%er there, great job.

No, you're making up things now. Or is this the strawman you mentioned because you didn't understand what I was saying?
The OP said "You send to a brainwallet" (Remember the OP, the person I was addressing before you decided to be a white knight and now you can't go back on it?)
I said "You don't send anything to a brainwallet." And you don't. The address is what is recorded in the blockchain. You claim that input with your private key. The only thing you send is a broadcast to the network **of the transaction**. The misconception that a lot of new people have is that you are actually holding or storing bitcoin on your computer and when you send it you are sending bitcoin to another computer. That's wrong and what I was correcting
The balance reflected in the wallet is the balance you can claim from the Bitcoin ledger, or blockchain. 
So are there anymore parts of this conversation that you didn't understand? I mean, it didn't stop you from moving forward anyway - you are such the bitcoin guru and all.
And the Mark Twain quote was a reference to:
"Never argue with a fool; onlookers may not be able to tell the difference"
Because you don't even fully appreciate half the words I'm using when I reply and you've successfully derailed this from me addressing the OP to whatever moved goalposts you are making up to try and maintain that white knight status. 
Your limited ability to comprehend what I'm saying left you in a position where you were little more than an ape throwing darts at topics near to what I was saying in hope that you might, by chance, get it correct or otherwise steer me on to a topic you could handle (That's called a red herring by the way.)
So... anything else you'd like to Google and copy/pasta to me?

So there was entirely zero point to being an early backer. I was one of the first 20 people to support you. That's cool, BFL shipped out to their friends and people in the media before the people who paid them too.


You ignored the correspondence. I got sick of your updates about 20 updates in. Like I pointed out multiple times. I don't have hours to devote to reading your updates when they all say the same thing "We messed something up, delays expected" 
Just because I don't blank out and accept your placating doesn't mean I'm ignorant. It just means I'm not as stupid as you are trying to take your backers for.


That's because it was posted before you continued the conversation. I took your cancellation of my order and "Thanks Alex" as a finality. **You didn't continue the conversation until you saw that I was serious about making it public.**


The TLDR is that you made promises you couldn't keep and when it goes half a year behind schedule you get upset at people who ask you question about why.


Results are what matter to people who give you money. I funded a project that made a promise. I didn't fun your science project and your vacation to China.


You never leveled. You preached about how holier than thou you are because you are working hard. Fuck you. You think your backers don't work hard for the money they paid you? You think we expected you to do anything other than work hard? You are failing, not your backers. You don't get to take out your frustration on the people who ask you questions. 
You had SIX MONTHS OF PATIENCE. You gave my questions less than 15 minutes of patience. Honestly, you'll never get my money for anything. 


Hopefully our paths never cross. I try to spend my time with people who make good on their promises and don't string along the people who support them.

Absolutely not. You are arguing there are rights. For you to have a right it means you are entitled to something of someone else's. If you have a right to speak it means there is a situation where someone may not want to listen to you. Instead of what makes sense - the two of you work it out. You can cling to your right to speech and their wants immediate take a backseat to your own.
Just like a right to healthcare requires the promise of someone else's labor; doctors, nurses, anyone who works in healthcare, to make it happen. You don't have any rights because nature doesn't give you any. Any delusion that you've given yourself otherwise is accomplished through threats and violence. Without them there is no way to get people who disagree with you to do what you want.

Ok, want to a fun experiment with me!
Wow, look at this!
Only 30% of Americans even have passports! There were only 61.5 million trips abroad in 2009 and HALF of those trips were to Canada and Mexico. 
So the target audience for that would be approximately 30 million people. Hey that's great but this is for newbies! I'd be willing to bet good Bitcoins that the majority of newbies are not international jet setters. Regardless, I'd bet a large majority of those people are going on business trips and their company or themselves have worked out arrangements ahead of time. Those kinds of people don't really like change, if it works don't fix it.
But I will completely agree. For whatever percentage of people you are talking to you are absolutely right. Too bad that is such a niche, narrow cross section of who this document is designed for the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

So you want to the Bitcoin client to keep track of public key mappings. So you do want miners to keep a full copy of the blockchain and it requires trust. This one fails, not to mention +/- some variance is actually a lot of variance. Especially since the hash rate is constantly changing as miners drop on and off the network.


Except it will never be accurate. The "some variance" you mention is much greater than you are making it seem

It is completely unrelated to his silk road activities. In fact, the people smashing down the door shouldn't have done it in the first place if it is true he didn't sell anything illegal on silk road.
That's called fruit of the poisonous tree and it's how a lot of evidence is thrown out in court. 
If something in an investigation is done wrong everything that comes from that wrong-doing is inadmissible. They could have seized pounds of cocaine and rescued sex slaves from his basement. If they charged in because of the wrong crime or because they did something wrong in their pretense for going in then he can't be charged for them.
So if they ignore that he becomes a martyr and the justice system is even more exposed at how much they disregard their own rules. If they follow the rules he is a free man.

I saw your last post but you deleted it before I could reply.
I... what? I think you're talking about inflating the money supply. I'm talking about fungibility.
If you increase the supply by a power of ten you do it by moving the decimal point. 
If I have 10 Bitcoin I now have 100 Bitcoin. Something that cost me .1 Bitcoin before raising the price will cost me 1 Bitcoin now. 
The buying power remains the same. I can just trade one decimal past the old satoshi.

This is the market. How you spend your money matters. If you banked with Gox it means you chose to ignore the warnings and promote a horrible business that was hurting everyone. 
Yes, if there is indeed a thief that robbed Gox from the outside I consider them patrons. At least the thief won't be foolish enough to keep those coins on Gox or somewhere similar, perpetuating these horrible establishments.

Wow, I'm just glad you weren't able to comprehend that very thinly veiled insult. 
The part I quoted:


Was a direct reference to your post. In fact, that's why it is a quote. you said that. I was speaking directly to it. Are you with me up to this point?


This is what I said. I said that because what you said was so fucking stupid I didn't have any other words to communicate that to you. The reason I said that was because **what you said was so fucking stupid**
It was so fucking stupid because pool operators don't have that much power. They really don't! But I know, I know, you've been reading about bitcoin for a couple weeks now and you are a really keen expert but really you're just part of the problem - one of the lemmings who chases the headlines **instead of thinking about repercussions to the things they pose for more than a few seconds**
Are you still with me? I'm trying really hard to break this down for you in small words.
The second part of what I said, the dual-meaning if you want to call it that, is that this same FUD that you are spreading about how easy it would be for government to just coerce large pool operators is the same dim-witted and numb-skulled, lizard brain idiocy through which most modern democracies function - hence the reference to statism.

There is no such thing as a bitcoin. What your wallet has is a very large number that only you will ever have (it's that big and that random).

I do not derive my right to property from the consent of others. If I have no right as an individual to own property then a group of individuals together still have no right to own property. Therefore by your own definition it is impossible for a group of people to come together and "create" the right to property.

Then you should know Google and googol are completely irrelevant to one another. Where Bitcoin is a payment system for bitcoins
Thus lowercase bitcoin is valid. Just like any other noun, googol. And Bitcoin is not allowed because it is a proper noun, Google.
But google is also a verb. Lowercase google is fine, "Go and google the rules for scrabble".

I'm not sure I agree given what you say about a 51% attack. 
The redundancy is part of the integrity guarding from the 51% attack. 
A centralized accounting system has a weakness - the accountant. It's much more difficult to subvert the distributed computing power in the Bitcoin network. 
If that is considered inefficient so be it but that's the defining trait that makes Bitcoin so much better than fiat currency.
As an aside, you do know that you do not need to run a full node, thus you do not have to download the entire blockchain, to run bitcoin.

There was this great book, The Denationalization of Money. It's all about competing currency on the free market.
There are many things Bitcoin does well, but there are other coins that do different things. Some of them are very interesting.
 * Devcoin pays developers and content creators
 * Namecoin is a DNS service
 * Datacoin is a storage service
The list goes on. In addition, they have different implementations, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
Anyone saying altcoins are merely tricks either do not understand what altcoins offer Bitcoin, are against progress and innovation, or are punch drinkers that don't understand enough about Bitcoin to realize altcoins are not a threat but a boon.

Well, depending on your stance. If you believe in Bitcoin's libertarian and anarcho capitalist roots then the Bitcoin Foundation certainly has done a lot to hurt Bitcoin in many of our eyes. If you think that legislation will legitimize Bitcoin and you welcome it then I would say Andreas Antonopoulos and the Dark Wallet crew.
Essentially the Bitcoin Foundation is gift wrapping their vision of Bitcoin for legislators and trying to get things included that would help governments.
People like Andreas and the Dark Wallet team are trying to keep Bitcoin as open and far away from government taint as possible.
Make your pick. Bring the down votes I love the pain.

They just accept your bitcoin at a 30% markup and rent from digital ocean. Basically, to use Bitcoin with digital ocean they are making it possible but technically they also have root access to all of your machines.

What my point speaks to is something you are neglecting.
The thief still has those coins for the time while Gox was lying. Unto recently the thief had those coins AND Gox had made up Bitcoins to cover what was lost. See the part where I said:


See these links to teach yourself more about fractional reserve banking
Yes. This is all speculation. However it appears to be true that Gox was operating a fractional reserve. So, the effective supply of bitcoin was indeed increased by the number of coins Gox was accountable for, held in their books when ultimately they never existed because the thief actually had them elsewhere. 
This was one of the reasons why people like me have been saying for years "Don't use Gox"

I'm holding back because you did ask in this thread.
It's just such a foreign concept to me -&gt; What is ridiculous about that? 
If you think about it, a few people control every aspect of all the world's currencies. So if you are looking for an answer in that regard, then yes absolutely fine with that compared to the present.
But let's look at the worst case. Worst case: Satoshi activates his key and spends it. That's it. 
I am totally OK with that too. I would almost bet dollars to donuts that this key is destroyed. Something that is overlooked is that Satoshi put effort in to being enigmatic. What's more enigmatic that 1,000,000 coins sitting inactive for decades. 
Not only that but it's something that could link the person or persons to that identity. If I was interested in anonymity I wouldn't even look at those coins if they were mine.

Well... just curious here - Do you plan on them writing in some connection to a third party web api? 
Because sites like Blockchain.info charts are based on information they store and analysis they run on the entire block chain. Hash % is based on the number of blocks that have been mined by the known/unknown addresses. 
What I mean is, it's not like the bitcoin client can just ask the network who the miners are and what their % of the hash rate they are. I mean, it would be totally groovy if something like that did exist but to me it sounds like a lengthy and involved project with little return in the form of solving the actual problem.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:53:21
Because if they were at &gt; 50% for any significant time they would have won a lot more blocks than what was shown on the charts.

So if I was new to bitcoin I would say this:
  *No Central bank to manipulate currency or accounts. 
Don't know what this is, don't care. 
  *Can not be intercepted, seized or frozen by any entity or government without the private key
That's never happened with my cash/credit/debit/bank transfers why should I care?
  *Peer-to-Peer system redundancy can not be destroyed.
Why do I care if Peer-to-Peer systems get destroyed? What does that have to do with Bitcoin? This is really confusing I don't understand. It's more trouble than it's worth.

I'm sorry. I assume that the folks who come to have a modicum of economic literacy. I suppose I just took for granted that you would understand a little more beyond scarcity and why it is irrelevant with respect to consumerism - in the manner in which you are portraying it, anyway.


Well no fucking shit. Such you're such a keen economist I'm sure you understand that as the supply of those resources dwindle if the demand remains the same then the price rises. As prices rise fewer people can afford it and then they start looking towards alternatives.
If gasoline were $20 a gallon because of a lack of supply you would see a giant increase in the number of electric cars. We have been creating new ways to increase the supply of solar energy. It would be cost effective to switch to competitors. Likewise, if solar energy were provided cheaply and it's use were comparable to gasoline you would see consumers move from oil to solar energy - because of consumerism. 
That's why eco nuts are so fucking stupid. You don't understand half of the things you fight over. They think that if you just yell in people's faces loud enough that they'll just change their mind and do what you want. 
Consumerism is amazing because the laws of economics allow the highest number of people to command the highest amount of wealth to the highest number of specifications they want. Combine that with capitalism and you have a lean, mean highly efficient means of allocating scarce resources in the way people actually want.
If you think consumerism is just giving everyone what they want because they want it you need to go back to school and figure out the definition of the word. Actually let me save you the time.


You're a consumer. I'm a consumer. Everyone is a fucking consumer. Consumerism puts your dollar on the same playing field as everyone else's. The products that do the most amount of good win. It means less war, far fewer weapons of mass destruction. It's the removal of centralized planning and an end to socialism/communism. It's one of the greatest economic revolutions in mankind's history.
Fuck. You.

"I don't get a copy of the transaction for my records?"
"No sir, it's up to you to keep track of that."
"So if I call the bank and say my withdrawal is short $1,000 what happens?"
"The bank keeps would have records that say it wasn't."

@_date: 2014-07-15 20:34:24
No, this isn't password guessing and I believe what you are thinking of was published [here]( On average you need to try about half the possible combinations before a correct brute force "guess" **when dealing with hashed passwords**. A Bitcoin private key is a hash but that hash has a range of roughly 0 - 256 digit numbers. So you can save the computation time just by generating the numbers, thus generating more keys.
At first that sounds like it would be insecure but that's because of how difficult it is to conceptualize a 256 digit number. Showing that was the purpose of that blog.
That blog I linked is off, though. Effectively any 256 digit number is a private key - which is what the blog shows. So if you wanted to brute force every key you would need all of them. However, because Bitcoin addresses are RIPEMD160 you would actually only need to brute force 1 private key for every 160 bit Bitcoin address. I say 1 because there are collisions in bitcoin addresses. E.g. multiple 256 digit keys will map to the same 160 bit address. There just aren't enough addresses for each private key to have its own (256 bits mapped to 160 bits is a lot of dupes)
However, you would still likely end up generating every possible key or end up so close to the upper bound before you did that. 
Just remember the birthday paradox has no authority here. Private keys are just 256 digit numbers.
See [here]( where the Bitcoin wiki explains this.

So I know it's really hip to act all "hur hur I do say, this tech is going to fit in to my ideology" when you are new but let me give you a few reasons why bitcoin is a tool of capitalism.
"[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" - First message in the blockchain from Satoshi
That book was written by Hayek in the 70s. It's all about currency being a commodity traded freely on the open market like any other commodity and the market deciding which one is best.

I think that Eleanor Roosevelt quote is getting popular right now.
Intelligent people talk about ideas.
Small minds discuss people.


Right. You are trying to say that this Democracy is so great because even the most unlikely of candidates could lift themselves up to become president of the most powerful government in history. 
That's your evidence that people really do control government because any schmuck can obtain a position of "power" by virtue of the electoral college.
I'm saying it's naive and ignorant to believe that it matters who is president. 
You're thinking isn't just inside the box. It clings to the box and refuses to step outside the confines that have been defined for you. It's why we call folks like you statists. You don't look at the reality of the situation because government is like religion to you. 
You don't care that the lawmakers don't make laws. You just care that you have the illusion that your vote matters and you find some satisfaction in thinking that because your country's leadership positions aren't passed down by bloodline that you're living on the high horse of freedom. 
I mean, you've got Obama. That negates the Bush Family, Clinton Family, Kennedy, Muhlenburg, Roosevelt's, Rockefeller's.... There's no seigniorage there because one poor black man was able to get elected president. And look at how different his presidency has been! So much change! See, it's still possible for one person to climb to the top politically and turn the entire country around. Shit, Obama couldn't even make George Bush's planned withdrawal time from Iraq.
So yeah. You're talking about a person and trying to use that anecdote as your appeal that "People really do control the government." And I'm talking about the idea that power never rescinds power and to think that those leeches give you anything other than the illusion that you matter is such folly you should give up speaking to other people for fear of spreading your horrible mind numbing cancer to anyone who would maybe believe otherwise.

Really? You don't have a clue how it works.
You think everything that comes out of Washington is a lie except the part about how lobbying works?
Here's how lobbying actually works:
"Hello BusinessPerson I am Senator/Congressmen blah and I just happen to sit on a board/panel or have a hand in writing legislation that affects your industry. Yes well we have a very important vote coming up soon and I bet you would be interested in making sure the write legislation is put in so as to protect your business interests. Did I mention that an election year is coming up and I am in need of donations?"
That's how lobbying happens. Yeah their are lobbyist who are beating on the door trying to get in but don't think for a second that those people are pulling the strings. Responsibility rests with the people who hold power. 
If you removed every lobbyist from Washington more would come. If you removed the powers of the government that enable these things to happen the lobbyist would disappear and the problem would be solved.

When given a choice between abusive parents (government/banks) I would chose the banks each time. I know what I'm getting. They're out to fuck me. Government doesn't just want to fuck me. They want to fuck my family, my friends, my money, how I live my life, what I put in my body. Even when I'm dead government wants a piece of my corpse.
I have zero problem with someone walking in to a bank and taking out a loan, putting their home and vehicle down for collateral and then spending all the loan money on cocaine. 
Government would ban the substance, arrest/beat/raid your home on suspicion and potentially lock you in a cage the rest of your life.

There is an extreme difference between private property and the accusation that you owe the "community" for merely being born. The only thing any individual owes anyone for property is the price.
So in your example of "ownership over the land that you do" when I bought property it didn't carry a burden of debt to my neighbors or anyone else. There were no stipulations other than "This is the price" and I paid it. Two people who agree is all that is required for a contract. 
No matter how many people are on one side you cannot force another person in to a contract if they do not agree. Anything else is disregarding private property rights.
I do want to note that you are trying to use private property to defend your argument but your argument is basically that no private property exists. 


You don't think roads would be governed by supply &amp; demand like any other good/service and the price would not be governed by consumer demand? Interesting. Please explain.


No. I am not. There a number of reasons. The first is no one in all of history has ever shown how government increased the value of one thing without first devaluing another thing more. Would you like to be the first person to do this? I would like to see it.
Second. Pick any government program that you think a person could benefit from and I will show you how the harm it does.
Third. I take no pleasure in the taxation of others.
Fourth. Morally you cannot make this claim. If even one dollar of a pascifists tax dollars go towards building a bomb or funding violence (arguably all government paths require violence but I'm making it obvious for you) regardless of how much "fruit" that person is given they have still been forced to compromise their own beliefs. How do you make amends to that?
Really, pick any of those. Whichever you think is easiest for you. 


Oh please. That's like telling a rape victim she chose the wrong street to walk down. No individual is responsible for the actions of any other individual. Or better yet "Oh you got hit by a car? Too bad, you made the decision to not get out of the way." Just absurd.


My ideology considers aggression a necessary requirement for violence. You can attack me and I can fight back. That is self-defence. 
By extension of my own self-ownership I own my labor and am entitled to the fruits of my own labor. Someone who is stealing from me or in some way attacking/infringing upon my property (my body or things I own - the fruits of my labor) I can defend myself. 
Because I am free to make contracts and form agreements with other people I can hire security firms to provide services I want. I am free to associate with my neighbors for security if I wish, but I don't have to. As long as I am not using violence, I am not aggressing,  against anyone else the sky is the limit for how I defend myself and my property.


Clever use of words. The social contract is not a deal. People are not banding together when you tell them "Get out of town or do what everyone tells you to do" that's conformity to an ubiquitous rule-set imposed by people with nothing else to offer society. 
The people who hide behind the social contract ensure that the threat of violence DOES loom over everyone's everyday life. That's how they make everyone do what they want.

I think HFT is apples to oranges.
If I send them 1,000 sheets of paper that list out or declare my transactions the best case I can imagine is:
  * Put stack of papers in a scanner queue
  * Make some Regex to pull out the data that matters
  * Do Math
I don't know scanner stats off the top of my head but let's assume 10s for the scan and conversion to some sort of OCR for the text. I'm sure there are some that are much faster but it's the government.
That's over 2.5 hours just to get the documents in a digital form. Then they would have to come up with the Regex.
Both of these are so easily thwarted. 
  * Use different fonts/sizes
  * Use different quality printers (the grainier the better)
  * Don't give them uniform data (makes the parsing harder)
So there are all kinds of ways of doing exactly what they want you to do without making it easy for them. This is exactly what they've done to us.

There is absolutely nothing recorded in the block chain other than the public key in the coinbase that could give you any kind of clue as to what pool mined the block - even yours unless you submitted the block.
There is not a mining tool that I am aware of that can give you the statistics from your block. You would have to rely on a 3rd party API (Like from the mining pool) to tell you what the hash rate is. It would still be a system of trust.
"Read the blockchain" is not a valid answer because nothing pertaining to hash rate or the portion of the network hash rate comes out of it. Unless you want mining software to start a trust based system where by public keys are identified and even then you are still relying on trust. 
Not only that but most miners don't have complete copies of the blockchain or even run the bitcoin client on their mining rigs. 
I seriously hope you'll do a little research before giving out answers in the future

That's interesting. I can't find where I said that, would you mind showing me so I don't disregard this as you pontificating about your own masturbatory view of the world. Or perhaps rather your view on everyone else's unverified view? (Also called a strawman argument)


These look like your metrics. You're free to judge others however you want. I think your mistake is presuming others will use the same ruler as you - or want to use the same ruler, yuck.
But see my comment about "pointing a gun at someone to get them to do the right thing." If you were right and people agreed with you why would you need to force them?


Well I would. That's what works for me. If you can't provide for yourself and there is no one interested in providing for you that's your problem, not mine. 
Also, in markets the free rider problem has been disproven... just an fyi if you want to catch up with this millenia, economics-wise 


You are speculating. Neither you nor anyone else on this planet has a clue what a crypto society will, if ever, be. 


This is called socialism but you seem to be presenting your opinion as an original thought. The system you are proposing via crypto is no different than the one we have now. 
Just because you cannot come up with a solution I think you make the mistake of assuming other people won't be able to come up with one either.


No you really do have to prove that. If you are making a claim like "Religion is responsible for keeping order during the Wild West" you need to back that up if you want anyone grounded in reality to take you seriously. 
I believe greed is what kept the peace in the wild west. I think atheists did just fine in the wild west. 
Again, even with atheism, the only thing you are showing is that you cling to the old way of doing things and you point at the upstarts throughout history and say "They are wrong" but really what you show is how more people associate with the idea and how, today, these ideas are stronger than ever.
I think most of your ideals are rooted in fear. This is a beautiful period in history, maybe you should enjoy the ride instead of trying to fit everyone else in to your tiny perspective?

Those are extorted from the public through fascist public/private partnerships. I am not a fascist but having those services because they are the only ones available certainly does not mean I support them. Much less that they could not be provided without the protection government currently affords them.


And those were their decisions, not mine and at best they are the only ones accountable, not me.

Systems of inflation have a tipping point where the rate of inflation grossly outpaces the rate of growth in the economy. 
The bubble starts with "We cannot afford this, print money. If we can gamble this money correctly people won't notice the effect because we'll create enough wealth with it to make up for the inflation." I.e. they think they are growing the pie but disregard the possibility that they could do nothing, or harm, spending it.
So they say "The solar sector needs encouragement. That would be a big return on investment for our money. We should print a bunch of money and 'create' a solar market in the economy. Who cares *why* it doesn't exist. Once it *does* people will spend their money on it."
It's just like any other gamble, as long a you win you are OK. But if they fail, well, hold on to your butt. If I print $1T and spend it on a company and that company fails then the next time they print money they have to make up for that as well. In Roulette it's called the Martindale and it's a guaranteed way to lose every time.

Can Bitcoin steal that business? Can it grow the market? Decide for yourself. 
If Bitcoin takes 25% of that market, without growing it, That's still ~$100,000 per coin.
Then look at credit card, debit, banking, currency, etc. Check all the markets it can disrupt. That's how you get an idea of where it could go.

I don't know but anytime an organization of power decides to take sides in social issues it usually ends up being a bad thing.
Policy is judged based on intention not effect.
Also, Wilson only caved on Women's Suffrage because his wife joined the protests and stopped sharing his bed. He wasn't a knight in shiny armor, he just wanted to maintain appearances and get laid... ever again.
Often Wilson gets painted as a hero to the modern left. He was nothing special he just made a number of very poor decisions that current political paradigms have an interest in validating so as not to harm their own positions.
Edit: I believe he even imprisoned his own daughter at one point for her actions in the Women Suffrage movement but I'm not sure. I recall something about prison conditions for women who had been arrested affecting him personally - I think because she was jailed by his thugs... I mean police.

Yeah, I think that's the dilemma a lot of people seem to have.
What I don't get is why people don't trust the person who made 650M to turn it in to 1B, or so on. Giving to charity is a personal choice, like deciding who you think is a douche bag. No one can tell you when you've made enough and no one should ever be satisfied with just "enough."
Especially when you can take any American and point to just about any of the other 6 Billion people living in the rest of the world and say, even to the poorest in America, "You can afford to cut corners so you can give to charity in other parts of the world." Especially in parts where $50k in America is more than entire families may see in their lifetimes in other parts of the world.

Buffet comes from a paradigm of "Do people need this?" If yes, invest and lobby. If no, go back to step 1.
For an industrialized nation, sure that works. For a digital, global free market economy it fails. It fails miserably. 
Every time human beings encounter a paradigm shift, such as we are now in moving from an industrial to digital era, those who are entrenched in old ways act to preserve their standard of living. Why retrain? Why obtain new skills just to keep what you have? It's so much easier to just keep things the way they are.
It only makes sense that Buffet would be against Bitcoin, he has everything to lose and little to gain.

Here's an ELI5.
You're wallet.dat is actually a keychain. The default is one big key (private key) and 100 small keys (public keys). When you press the "make new key" button in bitcoin-qt it just shows you one of those 100 pregenerated keys until they run out. Then it makes 100 more.
This is the key pool. 
If you have coins sent to any of the addresses in your key pool they will show up when that wallet syncs.
However, if you back up your wallet in 2013. And in 2014 you generate 100+ keys and you send money to the latest key that back up wallet will not have that new public key (It was generated after your back up). 
This is also partly why it is unsupported to run the same wallet.dat on multiple machines. If you have two copies of your wallet.dat and generate past the keypools on both there is no guarantee they generate the same new keys. In fact it is very likely they will not.

This is what we keep trying to explain to you all. 
A chart like this shows up and you just assume miner's jumped ship and this reflects the hash rate after that. Yah PETA moved but that's never been the solution.
GHash never went over 51%. Their hash rate was high enough to get over 50% of the blocks for a period of time. These things are not the same as a 51% attack or having greater than 50% of the network hash rate.

You can take it as hostility. 
You are treating two people who control the same private key as a race condition. You seem to think that if user X and user Y try to broadcast a transaction referencing the same input that it becomes a race condition. It is a double spend.
The only race condition I can fantasize would be you getting your tx to the nodes that references the input before other people do. 
I either addressed it in this thread or another. You can build the tx offline. In fact you could build both offline. When you come online you broadcast your txs to the nodes you are connected, they broadcast to who they know, etc. If you do it that way there is no race condition, according to my understanding. 
It doesn't require you having a bunch of nodes. It doesnt require a ton of bandwidth. It's just the topic is esoteric enough that the 'Best Buy' tech crowd can say the equivalent of "Throw more RAM in it" and sound like they know what they are talking about. It's bullshit.


You do not send anything to a public key. That is just the number that gets recorded to enable the receiver to claim that balance in the blockchain. You may just be getting the semantics wrong, but it's a huge difference and a mistake most people make. 


See above. I don't think you understand transactions.


It's not a concern at all. If anyone were to try and use your tx before you do this becomes a double spend. 
So here is my question to you. If I build both my tx offline, the first is the xfer to the known brain wallet address, the second using that input to send it along to one of my private key pairs, and then I broadcast both txs in order to all the nodes I am connected to and those nodes relay them outward how is someone going to be able to double spend my first input when my second tx would immediately consume it and all other tx's referencing that input (remember, the window of opportunity to use that tx input is in the milliseconds) going to ever beat me to spending it?

No no,
Inflation means the value/buying power is going down because the supply is being increased.
Deflation means the value/buying power goes up because the supply is finite and demand has increased. 
If I have a piece of gold and someone is willing to trade me 100 snickers bars for my gold I could make 100 pieces of paper that people could redeem for my gold - or the person with the snickers bars could trade them 1 snickers bar for 1 piece of paper and then redeem it with me. 
If I suddenly print 900 more pieces of paper I can't give everyone the same amount of gold as before. The person with the snickers bars can't give out the same number of snickers bars as before either. Now, to get the same amount of gold for each snickers bar he has to raise the price to 10 pieces of paper a snickers bar. 
My paper money supply was inflated - artificially because I had no increase in gold reserves to justify printing more paper. 
If, instead of printing dollars, I had double'd my gold supply I could then say each piece of paper is worth twice as much gold when redeemed. The person selling snickers could then lower their price to 2 snickers for 1 paper.
That's a practical example but is similar to why oil prices shot up in the US. Nothing really changed about the oil process. The dollar just got weaker.
A more realistic one is money being saved in a bank. The rampant inflating of the dollar is why you won't be able to buy as much with your savings in ten years as you would if you had spent the original dollar amount today. 
What's really scary is this: Take away the gold and you have the US dollar. 
Once people realize that &amp; the fed's inability to stop itself, to quote Doc Brown, "you're gonna see some serious shit!"

I'll play this game. Even though there is nothing new here.


You like to play the definition game. E.g. "Hur you may define it that way but I do not." This is called a Red Herring. To sate your masturbatory genuflection go ahead and say that but a safe definition for an adult is "an individual who is responsible for the repercusions of their actions"


It is defined by each individual, for themselves and is something they must come to terms with when making agreements or contracts or communicating with others who have similar interests.


Same answer applies. A safe definition of consent is "voluntarily giving your permission to another to perform some action on something which you own."


An externality is a market failure. There is a reality to... well reality. Eventually people get to a point where they stop letting perfect get in the way of good. The idealists love to play this card because they are holding out for Utopia. As if such a thing were even possible. They would point to an oil well that provides billions of dollars in profits and increases the standard of living of thousands of millions of people around the world and say "HAH, that's BAD because it hurts someone." 
The heart of this argument is that it attempts to quantify human life in to a dollar figure, or rather it attempts to trick the person on the opposing side of the argument in to saying "Yeah the value that oil well brought is greater than the value of those people's lives who were harmed negatively." The answer to "How do we deal with externalities" is simple: Each consumer should decide for themselves what they care about and spend their money accordingly. 


You're belaboring your previous point because you considered it "gotcha!" question, when it was actually something Michael Moore asked of Milton Friedman a long time ago. Friedman schooled Moore, like you are learning now because it's not really a question, so much as it is a trap.


Continues from before, this is more like Fox news than actually questioning.


And people should be free to choose for themselves whether or not they want that structure or not. These two sentences are trying to justify the means through the ends. You cannot account for what is lost, or never created, because of the opportunities that are stamped out by this government regulation.
What I mean to say is this. NASA has a lot of fans. People think that NASA is responsible for some really nifty things that work in our day to day lives. They claim that because government spends a lot of money on NASA it creates demand for that kind of innovation. What they don't understand is that those companies would still exist and that money they are being paid would still be in your pocket without government. If you wanted to support them, or patronize their business you would still be entirely free to do so, only you wouldn't have to fund a fucking space program before getting your god damn Tang.
Do you have any more fallacies you would like destroyed today?
Edit: I should note, this entire string of posts of yours on this topic all say the same thing "Life is too complicated for me to understand, I need someone to dumb it down for me. I choose government." I won't stand in your way of getting what you want. All I am asking in return is that you give me the same respect. However, the ideology you are defending won't permit you to do that. Where as mine does. Just on the basis of tolerance alone, I don't understand how a good person could see any value in what you are selling."

We're talking about storing your coins on a web wallet. The risk is what the risk is regardless of how much you are storing there. The amount you store has no bearing on the security/stability of the site. 
Basically, the point is, if you use a web wallet other than the ones that give you the private keys they are not yours anymore. You are gambling they will be there at a later date. As soon as you xfer those coins they are gone. You have zero guarantee of getting them back. If you send a small amount you are mitigating the amount of stupid you will regret later.

You can be anything you want to be. I wasn't disagreeing that there is value in Bitcoin outside of AnCapistan. 
If anything is ubiquitous I think this discussion we're having is apt. I find the beauty in Bitcoin because it replicates nature. It's scarce, obeys rules, codependent/ecosystem and most importantly it's completely voluntary and does it's thing (mostly) regardless of popular opinion. 
I say Bitcoin is anarcho because of those things. Essentially I'm willing to accept the label of an anarchist because I think the natural state of everything is anarcho. We can make as many laws as we want, empower any ideology as much as we want but we can't change the fact that anarchy will always exist.

That said. I don't want a group of people deciding over Bitcoin. It's fine just the way it is. Simple Libertarian principles are like fertile soil to ideas. Democracy kills those things.

This is what I've been guessing:
Gox was operating a fractional reserve. The bitcoins on their exchange "did not exist." So we're feeling the impact of 800k+ Bitcoins leaving the supply. 
I don't think the demand has changed because we all know what happened. Outside buyers will likely slow for a bit and Gox won't be around to artificially push up the price on their exchange.
Of course, it could just as likely be moon cycles and pagan gods ("Choose the form of the destroyer" - eh?). What do I know?

Reporter's can lie, but the name chosen by the person or persons writing the white paper could have been Bill Gates and the same response could happen.
It's also possible that during this guys "closed book government time" others he worked with simply chose that name because he seemed like a good scapegoat. This person also never said whether or not they were involved with the white paper, actual development or contributions towards Bitcoin at some other place outside of the open source community.
I don't believe the person who took the measures to protect themselves the way Satoshi did would go through all that labor and then use his **real life name** as his handle. It does not make sense.

When you said "Bitcoin's supposed utility as a currency or even a store of value is dependent on the world at large recognizing it as such"
I took that to mean that you were saying Bitcoin has value because people recognize Bitcoin as valuable. I'm telling you that whether or not people choose to recognize those values it does not change the fact that Bitcoin is what it is. 
You're trying to use the reasons fiat currencies have value for why Bitcoin has value. While they do overlap in that people recognize it as valuable Bitcoin has actual properties - finite amount, fungible, yada yada yada. 
The point is that bottlecaps instead of dollars is viable because both the tangible thing has about the same utility. Bitcoin and bottlecaps do not. 
Effectively you are saying "Gold only has value because people recognize it as valuable" and that is not true. It's value comes from it's properties - finite amount, real world utility in electronics, etc. Even if you everyone in the world said "Gold has no value" it would still have those properties and those are valuable. 
Paper is just paper and only government can take a perfectly good piece of it, cover it with ink and make it worthless.

It's not like that. It's a shitty world and shittier in NK. Those people are so far down the hole that the only light shining for them is Kim Jung Un holding a mother fucking flashlight and those sheltered people think that makes him a God.
Now little NK with paper wallets and information as to what they are. Explain that they can hold them and it will always have it's value. Tell them the risks, let them come up with their own solutions. Maybe they pool the money and send it with a group of people in to SK. Who knows what happens.

Everyone with Bitcoin keys/address agrees on a formula ahead of time.
See: [SECP256k1](
This means everyone is 'playing' on the same field. When you generate a key pair it exists somewhere on this gigantic finite field. As long as people use the same algo their keys exist on the same field regardless of who they are in the entire universe. 
Whether you use a computer, paper and pencil, calculator, whatever, you are using the same mathematics. That's why it doesn't matter if you are online or not.
Continuing, if you think of our field as a 3d graph and you stretched the graph out across the entire universe a single 'point' (private key) would be about 400 sq atoms. 
Furthermore, something called the Pareto Principle determines the current theory on the minimal amount of matter required to store 1 bit of information. Given that info it would take about 1.75 times the heat death of the universe to compute all possible private keys. Effectively, with current technology there is not enough matter/energy in the universe to store all possible keys.
However, because there are a capped number of units (bitcoin) there can only be so many active addresses at one time. I.e. if every satoshi were controlled by a separate private key. Because of this, the odds of you ever generating a key pair that another person owns is basically not possible.
The reason why it has happened in the past is because of faulty/poisoned PRNG. 
Now, when you generate an address is a smaller number than your public key. So there is a chance of a collision, though also astronomically small.

floats are numbers with decimal places. Floats are not precise, they round poorly. It's a beginners mistake to use a float data type with financial data. A better use is in video games or graphics where it's not that big a deal if your color red is 100% red. 99.98% red is good enough. Or your position on screen is a good example. Who cares if you are at coordinates 1,5 or .9999, 5.000001? It's not a big deal. This is finance, the decimals matter.
Other data types give you precision you need. However, the solution we are recommending is to use the satoshi as the base unit, instead of Bitcoin.
If you use Satoshi you avoid the decimal issue altogether. When you pass that data to your interface/website/whathaveyou you just tell the UI to put a decimal place 8 digits from the right.
It requires much less work, has fewer moving parts, and probably won't break.

EDIT: Keeping myself honest. 30% doesn't actually look that bad once I break it down. If he charged only 5% then it could require selling 200 VPNS for an entire month just to break even on hosting (maybe).  The worst case for 30% is ~4. I think that's very reasonable, when looking at it from a business pricing perspective. So it's quite a premium but maybe just the best the market could do right now.
I thought about different payment tiers, like 5% for $5/month and 40% for largest plans. I honestly didn't want to pursue it that deep because I thought this was so high it would be easy to just trim the premium and copycat. 20% could probably work too but for me this is too much risk/effort for too little return to find out. 
TLDR: Market Forces Gunna Work.
~~So all you did was make an api using digital ocean's awesome web service and you're paying for hosting out of~~ ~~your own pocket but charging 30% markup to anyone who sends you bitcoin and even though you are~~ ~~probably instantly converting it to cash you claim the markup is to mitigate conversion rates?~~

Read the last sentence you quoted... Do you have any idea how much it costs a hospital system to maintain records? Any idea at all?


Who fucking cares? It's a voluntary hierarchy. In a market system the business that refuses to cooperate in the customer's interest loses. 


Oh great, now you make it obvious this is a fantasy you're creating as you go along.


A patient would never write data to the block chain... They would never need access... You have no fucking idea how healthcare records work do you?


Yeah, basically the worst case scenario of this proposal is the equivalent of today's best case scenario. Except under my proposal the worst case applies to the third world and any business who chooses not to participate. Today, it applies to every hospital system, everywhere. There is no universal patient health information database. Anywhere in the world. 
I bet you have no idea why.


You don't see a need for hospitals to have a common agreement on a patients health history? Stop breathing. Yesterday.


Do you have any idea how medical diagnosis work? 
'V9542XA' is enough to record 'Spacecraft crash injuring occupant, initial encounter'
'V91.07XA' is 'Burn due to waterskis on fire, initial encounter'

@_date: 2014-06-17 18:47:33
That is my point.
As you approach 51% your chance of mining more than 51% of blocks for a given window of time increases. This hysteria is from a lack of reading a graph. Ghash only mined over 50% it doesnt mean they have 51%.
E.g. you have a hypothetical dice. It has six sides. On three sides you have the number 3. On two sides the number 2. On one side the number 1. 
You can roll the dice in sets of 100. Let's say 100 sets. Some sets will roll 3 more than 50%. Some sets will roll 3 less than 50%.
Take that analogy and make the dice sides and distribution equal to hash distribution. Make a set a days worth of blocks. Some days the largest proportion will 'win' more than their probability. 
The chart everyone a citing only shows that info.

No. It's math.
For example, I have a digital document. I can hash that document, I won't explain the process as many others have explained it elsewhere. 
A strong hash algorithm gives me a unique value for that document. I record that unique value in the block chain. The block chain acts like a record. I.e. if I recorded that hash value a year ago this digital document must have existed a year ago otherwise it would have been almost impossible for me to know the hash value.

Why would people stop mining after the block reward is gone?
Edit: To put this in to perspective. Why would anyone spending oodles of money buying mining equipment just to turn it off? Yah, everything ends and eventually Bitcoin will too but why would miners - presumably those who hold a lot of bitcoin - suddenly decide to stop and kill their own investments? Even without the block reward they will want to keep mining just to support their own transactions.
Don't forget about merged mining either.

[Anarchy is everywhere...](


Yes. The more state power exists the closer to socialism it becomes until there is total state control. The complete absence of state control is called anarchy, trade that occurs within anarchy is called capitalism.
Do you need a full recap of 5th grade social sciences or are you good now?


And why do you need a state for any of that. Why do you affix government to governance? That's the narrow-minded and dimwitted thoughts that socialism confine themselves to. It's sad.
And this conversation doesn't move forward until you satisfy this:


Where did I say these things? It's easy for socialists to win arguments when they can frame and define terms freely. When you're actually scrutinized you fall apart pretty quickly. Ignoring this, making the failed counter-accusation and then following up with another strawman in the same post is pathetic.

Thinking you'll slide something by regulators is the wrong strategy. 
For starters, you won't. What goes in to a bill is decided by many many dozens or hundreds of people. The politicians are just faces. 
The parts of government that can do harm to bitcoin will know everything they need to know about it. There is no appeasement. 
The best strategy for Bitcoin moving forward is to shed any attachment to nations, countries or other forms of bureaucracy and think about how we can get the world using bitcoin. This is how the nation state starts to die. 
Bitcoin is a peaceful, non-aggressive way to opt out of failed systems, leadership and governments. That is the message needs to be put forward. Then it's not a matter of if someone wants to get involved, it's a matter of when. 
I think we probably agree on those things but that is absolutely no reason to put forward appeasement. 
To belabor more metaphor: Bitcoin is an unstoppable object gaining speed. Government is an immovable object. We don't need to smash the state, we'll just sidestep it and move so far ahead of it that it will no longer matter - just as the monarchy, religion, tribal warlords and all other forms of tyranny to come before it.

Yes but Bitcoin cannot simultaneously offer what Bitcoin offers and an altcoin can offer. Not yet, anyway.
Bitcoin only has one production environment. It's a fantastic production environment, granted. However, just like any other market the altcoin competitors have advantages. 
The cost of Bitcoin's network effect and mass adoption compared to an altcoin is it has to move slow, mistakes are amplified. This translates into altcoins being able to take greater risks than Bitcoin. Yeah, we can talk about testnets, we can point out how altcoins are used to launder stolen coins, etc, etc, but this is still a market. 
A market unlike one any of us have ever seen in our lifetimes. I wouldn't expect it to be exempt from what we normally observe in a market. If anything, we should expect more because Bitcoin is the freest market in recent history.

That's good scifi. 
I think the incentive for ACs is that people want them. Yes, I could run and control one, e.g. it sends me a profit every week/month. However, unless I can justify that money being sent to me through increased business to the AC it just becomes a margin someone else can cut.
I think ACs will eventually become open source projects. Kind of like we have now. The ACs themselves will decide which forks/patches to accept - ideally, but how that is accomplished I have no idea. Perhaps a new digital version of each fork and the best survives. Who knows
I would think a bitcoin nest egg would just be to hedge against competition. Assuming multiple ACs that do something - we'll say a vending machine that orders its own resupply, hires movers to get to better locations based on cell phone tracking data and prices based on market prices from competitors APIs and what the past price history performance for itself has been.
All things equal - same products, same location, same prices, the only real incentive is like Coke/Pepsi. It's brand, loyalty, history, etc. having a nest egg that allows one AC to lower prices temporarily - say long enough to put another vending machine out of business. Is not unreasonable however it is untenable for a long period of time (I.e. the nest egg runs out of money). 
I don't think of ACs as sentient beings. There wouldn't be any reason to "buy its freedom" from its owner. It's much more likely unowned ACs would be released before that ever became a possibility with older version just dying off. 
So I agree, there isn't much incentive to get rid of your AC if you own one. The market would just pass you up though.

No, it most certainly doesn't boost the economy if things cost more. You seem to think that allocated resources from somewhere else means "It comes at no cost to anyone." 
Either it comes out of someone else's paycheck, research, design, testing, quality, supply chain, legal, etc. If the business wants to continue to function the same way prices must go up. Even if you get your way and the currency is taken from someone, some place or somewhere else it still carries are a cost with it that increases the expenses that go in to providing you the same good or service from the time before the raise. 
The article you are championing about Seattle provides no actual data as to why it is 'working.' The only hint of explanation is where it talks about the federal government saving on food stamps and other welfare programs. If that's how Seattle has addressed it then it hasn't accomplished much than figuring out a way to deliver money it takes from people, back in to their hands and at best, is a government band aid to fix a previous government band aid that started festering.


I'll explain it in smaller words for you then. Both statements go hand in hand. Since Woodrow Wilson the American labor market has been saddled with unnecessary legislation that has led to a work force that is too expensive to hire without piling on the workload and doing anything you can to cut costs. Mostly because of folks like yourself who think with their emotions when you hear "That person makes $10 to vacuum the carpet" instead of finding out if that's all the job is really worth.


So you're not defending it right now? You claim it's a response to fix exploitations but do you really believe that is what has been accomplished? It looks to me like all your rules and attempts to force everyone in to an ubiquitous mould have accomplished nothing more than the opposite of what you've hoped to achieve, and worse, forced the largest players in to situations where they've had to become oligopolies to survive. 


Well, my system works and is sustainable. It gets billions of people around the world with different cultures, religions, faiths, ideologies, skin color, desires, talents, skills and wants to work together without violence. Yours is falling apart around the world as we speak. Yours has toppled entired nations and caused the deaths of so many and you cannot point to one example of it working. Yours uses violence and sends men with guns to enforce your will and if the people you try to bully won't comply your system kidnaps them, forces them to be judged by its legal system and cages them and/or takes their property without consent. 
Again, why does my system have to justify itself to yours when you are only interested in the intention of your actions and not the actual effect? The ends certainly do not justify the means and that is exactly what you are saying with your masturbatory nationalism (right or wrong). It's very sad to see such a lack of critical thinking and regurgitation of platitudes without a thought to what they imply.

Dude, government is a machine for creating this exact situation. This is the definition of government.

For bombs and bullets. Some of us don't think the world requires violence - or that somehow an organization becomes legitimate in its applications of violence simply because it is too large to fight against.


[Sure we have.]( People have been contesting your religion/government/establishment since time immemorial. 


Holy shit. You are aware that Bitcoin was created in defiance of governments and their mismanagement of the monetary policy - right? 
What stability? Hey, how many wars were starting by any other organization than government? What's the death toll of governments vs any disease in the history of mankind? How many private organizations develop nuclear weapons? 


What, you mean the worst-case scenario for Anarchy is a system that looks exactly like what we have now? Gee...


Or you need to learn the difference between government and governance. You're making government into religion.


It's just not going to happen. Just because you fail to feed yourself with your napkin math theories and needed to join the Air Force to secure a meal ticket and place to live does not mean the rest of us are incapable of developing skills and talents to offer our fellow man. 
Most of us don't need to rely on government. We are more about taking back the 40%+ of our wages and labor that is stolen from us to support welfare queens like you.

I am not disagreeing that adoption is bad. I'm also not disagreeing that in the long run this could lead to more buyers. What I am saying is that if more Bitcoins are being converted to fiat than fiat is being converted to Bitcoin then the supply of available bitcoins goes up and the demand for bitcoins goes down. 
Market price is dictated by supply and demand. Marketing and advertisement is an attempt to increase demand. When someone who doesn't use Bitcoin sees that they go "Meh." To businesses it's another revenue stream that isn't necessarily being replenished as fast is it's being used.

The value of those systems is determined by the market. Not a bunch of children whose minds are running over capacity from the enlightenment of Bitcoin's data structures.
For whatever reason, the folks who have shown up here in the past couple years seem to think Bitcoin is a fixed, beautiful snowflake that will never be disrupted, have any competition, and gains all of its value from its decentralized nature. Which just isn't true. No matter how many stupid fucking meme's y'all sling back and forth all day it all just equates to jerking each other off.

I'm not disagreeing that is possible.
I'm telling you that it's easy to say that because you aren't forced to substantiate any evidence. 
Can you quantify legitimacy? Can you prove new businesses and users are coming because of TigerDirect and Overstock? 
I would almost bet on new businesses, but I don't think that does anything for the users. I still think the majority of people who don't know bitcoin aren't going to get on the bus because of a store accepting Bitcoin. These businesses are an outlet for holders to spend bitcoin, not to attract a new user base.
So to answer your question, a good marketing campaign is worth the return it gives. I don't think the return on Overstock or TigerDirect accepting bitcoin is worth anywhere near the credit it's given. 
It's not until these organizations begin paying out employees in Bitcoin and creating new bitcoin users from their supply chains that they become worthwhile to us in any way other than to dump coins. While Overstock has begun that for... I think three employees, it's nowhere near any point that will matter for some time.
And even then, that won't be marketing. It will be economics &amp; bitcoin that made that happen.

This sounds like how a peasant would grovel before the master "Oh please sir, only beat me once today.

This sounds like paradise. Because, yah know, if you wanted to rule the world and bring tyranny to people the corporate ladder is totally the best way to do that. Not like government has a massive army that can be used for that. And not like voters are less intelligent than shareholders. Oh and the private sector will probably force you to show a result, where as voters only really care about intentions.
Yeah, all those big businessmen are so greedy they care about nothing other than money but somehow they simultaneously want to bring tyranny to your door.

That scaling technology does not follow a linear growth would be a humble start.

Humor me. What if Kim Dotcom figures out how to migrate Mega storage to Bitcoin? What if Bitcoin morphs into a sophisticated decentralized storage system that only the uber rich (world population-wise) is able to access? Miners acquiesce due to the shift from currency and diminishing block reward to increased incentive from Kim's fee model.

I don't think that part about Hearn is true. He wrote [Bitcoinj]( I don't believe he was ever a core dev or has any code in Bitcoin core (Not to undermine his work. His contributions are tremendous).
Hearn isn't the only one who wants to change Bitcoin. The core devs are treating him the same way as anyone else. Just because Hearn controls XT doesn't make him an exception. 
I'm not aware of any core devs who are against increasing the block size. Even the blockstream devs acknowledge the change needs to happen. Adam Back addresses the issue right (here)[


It's about how decisions are made


This is really scary for me. In so many different words you are saying "I am alright with centralized authority as long as it gets me what I want. Majority dictates what is right." I would not view that as Bitcoin at all. That's a fiat-based altcoin.
To me this entire thing is an attack against how things are made in Bitcoin. I think any organization interested in destroying the technology knows they can't tamper with the software but they can subvert its caretakers.

This is definitely not anarchy. 
It's like saying "Voting is valid within a system of anarchy as long as every individual voluntarily chooses to participate in the voting system. It's just free from the coercion of forced participation." 
"We bought some land and we'll be practicing communism on that land. We're still under the umbrella of anarchy because that system of property rights protects our right to disregard property rights."
There is no confusion. This is an election and decision based on a majority of minority participants that will decide protocol for the majority of participants. There is no difference between what is happening here and the US Congress. In fact, there is no way to say this is even representative of anyone other than those individuals who control the mining pools. 
Yay decentralization!
If the only thing that comes out of Bitcoin is a return to the shitty policies that birthed Bitcoin why are you people here? Just stick with your fiat currency and stop trying to drag the word anarchy down the shitter by attempting to rebrand it like the fucking socialists have.
The only anarchic act would be Gavin and Hearn taking their changes and making a new fork/coin to compete against Bitcoin. If you want 8MB blocks then do it. Whoever goes with you makes their choice. Letting the consensus of the few dictate the means of many is Democracy. The idea that just because some strangers vote something as good for you and me without ever having met us and we have to go along with it is the antithesis of anarchy.

You can't prove that. You can't demonstrably show that some other function will be cheaper for miners and earn them greater profits than using Bitcoin as a payment settlements network. 
The entire point is this community seems to think that to scale you just increase limits. It's not your damn home computer. "Just add more X" does not scale a large system

A hard fork is a separate block chain from the old chain. A fork does not mean that the coins are split between the different chains. It means the coins exist on both chains. 
The fork for Bitcoin XT is like booting an altcoin with premining equivalent to balances at some Bitcoin block height and using their balances as a way of convincing them over to your side. The price they pay is letting you set your altcoins' rules to take place from that point onward. 
Hearn could write XT to fork its own chain without changing any of the attributes. It could be identical to Bitcoin in every way. It would still be an altcoin bootstrapped from Bitcoin's block chain.
I favor this explanation because it respects everything that makes up Bitcoin outside of the source code. It respects the change and governance process that's in place. It respects the original intent of Bitcoin, to me that means that one actor or the loudest voice doesn't get to control things for the majority. It respects the fact that not everyone who is part of Bitcoin exists on Reddit. And it forces you to interpret Bitcoin as and idea instead of software.
Hearn basically made a threat. He is taking his ball and going home. You're welcome to go with him but if you give in to someone like that once they will do it to you every time. This is not the action of a leader, it's the tantrum of a dictator without any power. Maybe he is right technically but this is not how you communicate that.

You just need a mining pool with ~15%-20% of the hash rate. A good reason for a mining pool to hold their coins is to attract this kind of buyer. 
They can sell higher because both sides know what would happen if someone suddenly tried to buy 10,000 coins. $2,830,000 is a huge splash and about 13 - 15 days worth of mining for a large pool. Guaranteed money is always worth more than potential money.

Pricing mechanisms are subject to market forces.
If I put you in a pit with a homeless person and say the first person to kill the other wins $5k it's a lot different than if I put you and Bill Gates in that pit. Gates would probably just give you $10k to go away. At what point did the value of a human life change between those two scenarios? Is your life worth $5k in the first scenario and $10k in the second? Does Gate's value of his own life boost the value of yours in the second scenario?
OP's post is kind of like a high school understanding of economics. It assumes that all exchanges are normalized, miners instantly dump all mined coins and buyers instantly buy said coins. 
It's entirely possible that no one has bought or sold any coins. It's also possible that half the mined coins were sold and only $500,000 were purchased. 
It literally fails to account for every. single. other market force (which is just another umbrella term for any human action in the universe)
The best Bitcoin example are off-chain or off market transactions. Why would a whale like Overstock or any other company buy on a public exchange? Warren Buffet could probably buy every single coin off most exchanges. On those markets the supply would drastically fall and the price would go up. Even slow buying over time could influence the price. 
If a huge buyer wants to get into the market with a large buy quickly they do it outside of an exchange. OP has no way of getting that information.

I have. It's a nice read to get people fired up when they are in junior high.
If you do half a heartbeat of research you would have found that when Sinclair wrote that book the meat industry had been regulated for over a decade.
The act that regulated the meat industry passed in 1891, the book was published in 1906. The act passed under the guise of "protecting consumers" although there was never any evidence presented to show any danger of contaminated meat. 
Furthermore, [historical study]( reveals that the advent of refrigeration in 1880 contributed to Chicago's meat industry dominating the market. Minority businesses (in this case minority means market share, no reference to cultures) lobbied the government. The small businesses claimed (without evidence) the larger Chicago firms were selling tainted meat. 
Not letting the opportunity go to waste, the larger firms also pushed for increased regulation - knowing the smaller businesses would not be able to afford the cost of regulation. 
A 1906 [study by the Burea of Agriculture]( claimed Sinclair was "intentionally misleading", "deliberate misrepresentation of fact", and "utterly absurd."
However, the Chicago firms were right. Smaller business could not afford to pay the inspectors and increased cost of doing business that regulations bring. Many went out of business and since that day forward the US meat industry has organized itself into a state-based system of supply and command. 
Maybe stop referencing fiction books as fact, huh?

Im Kim Dotcom (not really). I want to port Mega to a block chain. Me, personally, I don't know how to do this. I have tons of resources, though. With no limit to block size we're essentially paying for storage. If my business model brings in more money than the cost of transactions and I'm able to pay more than block incentives why would miners not want this?
Of course protocol changes need made, otherwise you are shoe horning gigs of data through script sigs. Regardless, the flaw is in thinking Bitcoin will remain a payment network if we remove the block size. Removing the cap opens up Bitcoin's uses but two-way pegged sidechains insulates Bitcoin core from that while adding those features on... sidechains. 
What we have works. Let's not change something that works just because a better solution to our problem is a few years out.

Anyone who believes in Bitcoin should realize how fucking dangerous it is to make source changes based on a Democracy.
Hearn is extremely good at taking a conversation between other people, quoting them and then taking his time to reply and shape the previous discussion into a very poor position for another argument he makes.
The Satoshi quote he pulls out of his ass - that he used in his blog post - is in regards to mining. E.g. Eventually only specialized server farms will be able to compete at mining. Surprise, it's happening. 
Hearn is attempting to shoe horn that quote into a reply to Maxwell who is saying "Larger Blocks increase the network risk from SPV nodes." Surprise, it literally happened on the 4th of July. SPV Nodes =/= Mining. 
Furthermore, lemmings like yourself are clinging to people who bang their chests when they don't get their way. You don't take the time to understand the dialog and further obscure the value of the discussion by making fruitless posts such as this one.

How do you not get that a spammer paying $5 a transaction would effectively fund the network? Seriously stfu and think critically for half a heart beat of your bleeding liberal heart.
If the cost in participation goes up it severely limits the spammers ability. Do you really believe someone would spend $50,000 sending 10,000 transactions? Of course not, and before you bitch about that being too much - No it isn't. Unless you want to pitch altcoins nothing is better than that and it's still a remittance price people will line up for.

Personally, I think it's a requirement that the coins never move. It's kind like the saying "Eating your own dog food."
But also it opens up lots of questions. Like, what if in 50 years the coins move? What does that say about Satoshi? Age-wise, intelligence wise? Could it be a single person who handed it down? A group of people? A Government agency or body? Is there an ulterior motive? Did we miss something? Is something broken? Is this a thief? A new type of hardware that computes private keys? The list goes on
And the thing is whether it's today, 50 years or 500 years for as long as Bitcoin is relevant those questions will come up. So, to me, I think it's important that Satoshi never be found or move the coins.

Nope. Nothing in Bitcoin is encrypted. Bitcoin uses cryptography.


Nope. There will always be as many bitcoin as have been mined. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin ensures no single entity has control to manipulate policy.
The price of a bitcoin vs a dollar has been volatile in the past. What do you expect from a nascent, esoteric system that is the first of its kind vs a system that runs rampant with manipulation, counterfeiting attacks and sways on the whims of bureaucrats. It has steadily become less volatile over time and my personal opinion is that it will continue to stabilize.


It is pseudononymous. You control access to your funds. When someone "sends" bitcoin they just record a transfer of ownership in a public ledger. Anyone can spend any bitcoin at any given time - they just require the cryptography key to unlock them. 
Those cryptographic keys are stored in wallets and there is virtually no way of proving you control any given key at any given time other than being caught.


Mining bitcoin, effectively, is a computer randomly generating a number in a specified range. Bitcoin is just a massive guessing game for computers. When bitcoin are mined it means one computer has made a correct guess and has been awarded new bitcoin.
This is akin to printing money in a fiat system. The difference is bitcoin adheres to rules. In this case, specifically, the number of bitcoin created and when is predetermined.
Yes, many people will trade government paper and ink for bitcoin but I think they are crazy.

There is a correlation in the community. 
The greater the CS knowledge the more likely they are to say that changing a protocol is very difficult. Pointing to the recent BIP66 fork last Saturday is a good example. 
The less CS knowledge the more likely you are to see an emotional argument.
E.g. "We NEED to increase the block size NOWWWW" is based on nothing. We could make the block size 10GiB and we could flood the blocks with transactions the same way they are flooded now and then we could still say "We NEED to increase the block size NOWWWWW"
Bitcoin will only be able to go so far vertically. What's lost within this particular community (Reddit) is that makes Bitcoin a cornerstone - irreplaceable to crypto infrastructure. 
It's been my suspicion for some time that the most vulnerable attack to Bitcoin is changing the underlying protocol. As it stands now Bitcoin can last forever. The question is in what capacity? 
I want Bitcoin transactions to become very expensive. I think that is the natural end to Bitcoin. Off-chain transactions and side chains are the future of the network. Otherwise we are caught in an endless cycle of trying to make Bitcoin do all the things. Just because a transaction becomes more expensive does not mean it becomes more expensive for the user. This just creates more market opportunity. 
E.g. I run a service that commits multiple transactions of my sidechain or altcoin to Bitcoin. I handle multiple large clients and to attract more business I offer my services for free to ordinary users. We see this model online all the time. It's a very natural process in the free market. 
Not only does that lower ordinary user transactions it makes a lot of things possible on the service end of users. 
The disagreement is further proof this needs to happen. Development needs to begin sharding. The believers in one ideal must innovate their own changes and implement them to compete with other ideals. Those who are most right will win. The only important thing is insulating Bitcoin from these individuals and the best way to do that is as I mentioned - making Bitcoin the backbone of crypto infrastructure instead of the flagship frontend

Instead of trying to think it through from 0 to 10 try thinking of an intermediate stage. The hardest part of explaining the trade aspect of the ideology come from making that mistake. 
Just because a solution does not exist right now does not mean one cannot exist. For starters, we could have the exact same system we have now but replace the centralization via politicians with a vote. I don't think that would be much better but its more of a jump from 0 to .2 instead of 0 to 10. 
Also, once the threat of armed men goes away innovation happens. Seriously, if someone wanted do you believe the technology would or could exist to handle this demand wirelessly? Via Satellite? Via Fiber lines? 
These organizations that do have permission to conduct business in these areas would absolutely lean on government to protect those interests if and when innovation tries to take them out of power. 
Ultimately, most citizens view government as an organization that spends their money better on 'some' things. In that sense, there are plenty of tools to replace them. 
How about this off the cuff, back of the napkin idea:
What if every dollar you spent in taxes was placed in an account for you like kickstarter. You fund the projects you want with that money. 
I would argue that even if the same percentage of voters turned out as they do today that money rotting in an account and doing nothing has a greater economic impact than if it were spent on a bomb. Especially if the bomb is used. 
Free riders? Sure, but I bet the 1% and business would pay for lots of things the 99% would use. Still arguably stronger morally than the current system, though.

The simplest answer is: Just because no one is posting a solution on Reddit doesn't mean one does not exist. Furthermore, the mentality on Reddit concerning taking the financial incentive out of Bitcoin/block chains is the exact same mentality shared by people who say Bitcoin is not possible. 
If anything, Bitcoin functioning as a currency is a side effect of how the system works. People say it's impossible to separate the currency from the technology and maintain any sort of incentive to the system beyond a RDB. They're absolutely wrong. 
Bitcoin, the currency, is just a number written in a file. The real power of blockchains are the control you gain over consensus. If people stopped looking at block chains as a way to maintain units of account and instead a way of controlling a voluntary consensus the power becomes completely apparent. 
Unfortunately, most of the new people in the last four years have no idea what that implies. It takes a completely different way of thinking that participating in state-based economic and civic systems condition out of people.

First, I know this is like a job for you. So enjoy the $.50 per reply or whatever.


I thought that was pretty clear, yes. If I did not say that clear enough then I hope that makes it clear.


If individuals don't have the power to govern themselves from where do they derive the power to govern other people ??
It's not like a ballot box gives people special powers.


And? Religion and government are perversions of governance. Just because you fail to understand the difference doesn't mean that ignorance is ubiquitous. 


If anything, all you can show throughout history is an increasing push for individual liberty vs a decreasing push for collectivism. The perfect metric for this progression is the amount of privacy that exists in the world. 
The only thing your quip exemplifies is that throughout time there have been large groups of people interested in wresting the right to personal privacy away from as many people as possible and hoarding the benefits for themselves. 
However, the longer human history is occuring the more people that prefer individual privacy and choosing their own bias over having others decide that for them.
So if the only response you have is "All of human history shows that people like you are increasing and people like me are going the way of the dinosaur" I'm just fine with that.
Now go find some other bullshit to apply the golden ratio to.

I don't understand what that means. As in, SHA256 becomes broken? I.E. anything you hash with it is predictable? 
I'm not sure I know a definition of compromised where that would really matter to miners. It's just work they have to do. In that regard, it may be difficult to design something that breaks a hash for block/transaction data. I doubt it would affect miner's at all.
The reason for the controversy over algorithm is specifically because of ASICs. Literally, on the physical hardware, SHA256 does not require any memory - it runs entirely through the processors. 
Algorithms like Scrypt and X11 intentionally present problems for ASICs. Scrypt requires memory. If SHA256 looks like this:


Then Scrypt looks like this


This is not how it works, its simply to show Scrypt requires RAM. It takes time to store/retrieve and bus that data. Also, ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. They don't have memory, at least not much and those transfer read/write times affect hash rate, significantly.
The X11 Algo is a mixture of 11 algorithms and the ordering changes, so it's difficult to develop a fixed ASIC Chip that satisfies the permutations.
So none of this really relies on security. The security is a side affect of the properties of the algorithm. It's difficult to come up with even a scenario would a broken hash algorithm would hurt a cryptocurrency.

Great answers but I feel like this is a product looking for a problem. 
A small, cheap POS is appealing to small business but why buy a specialized device? 


Errr, I may have to disagree with you. Responsive design? Also, it's a point of sale so your user experience is a paid employee. If you sell 1,000 You'll still have fewer than &lt;5,000 users, easily.


Wat? NFC scans at a terminal. It would be on the programmer to get the data from the scanner over the web... I'm very confused by this answer


I see, so no web NFC api is already built for you to plug in to the project?


Well... I think you have a serious design flaw. Are you planning on sending the private keys over NFC? On the client side they would need an NFC reader to pick up your POS transaction so they could pull the TX to their device and sign it. Otherwise, they have to beam your POS the private keys.
Is there a way around that yet?


Ahh, interesting. Regardless, NFC is just a form of media. I'm not sure why it's a big lift or a priority given. How many NFC phones exist and how many Bitcoin users carry NFC phones? What are the projects in the next year or two?


So this is just practice with NFC for you until you get the project you want? When those are more mainstream will you be jumping projects and abandoning this one?
Personally, I don't think NFC will last long enough to matter. I think it will get replaced before Bitcoin would have a need for it. Also, I never understood the NFC love from a Bitcoin perspective. The two technologies are just a bad fit.

What does that mean?


Only in a few extreme cases and it would be very, very expensive. 
Even if its in the same ten minute window it wouldn't matter. The transactions sit in a pool and wait to be placed in a block. If you've ever sent bitcoin without a fee and its taken days to go in a block that's where your tx sits. 
It would be lost forever if every network node holding the TX was turned off. If could become a bad transaction and rejected if there were a block withholding attack and the same inputs were spent in another transaction.

No one is "picked" to become a Freemason. If you want to become a Freemason you ask one for information and you pursue it. No one is inducted without them first seeking it out.
"Chosen" = anonymous democratic vote on new members via white or black ball. Hence the term "Black Balled"

No. No. No.
The 3 tx/s is a limit because of the number of transactions that currently fit inside a block. It is DOS protection and a huge time saver for miners. It has nothing to do with the ability of the network to broadcast, propagate or process transactions. 
Either increase the block size or decrease the transaction size. Given the avg tx size is about 280 bytes, not happening. Gavin's working on 20MB block sizes. It requires passing metadata between nodes instead of the full block. That's the problem preventing larger block sizes and transactions per second. 
Technically, Bitcoin can handle thousands of txs per second, no problem. It just takes time to commit them to the block chain.
@_date: 2015-03-16 13:36:40
You don't have to wait, is the simplest answer.
There are a few scenarios that need to be accounted. 
First, the simple double spend.
I craft two transactions, somehow I ensure the network rejects the transaction you see while confirming the second to the block chain. If you wait 2-3 seconds this is mitigated. Large exchanges and processors watch the largest, most connected Bitcoin nodes to prevent this kind of thing. 
This is why you only need to wait 2-3 seconds. This attack relies on poor programming to accept a payment just for seeing a tx, not for the tx making it to the block chain. Once the tx has been relayed through the larger network nodes it cannot be rejected through this vector. 
Once a tx is broadcast miners hold it in a pool of transactions, waiting to add it to a block.
The second way - I send you the tx you want but when I mine a block I put a different tx in the blockchain and it spends the same funds as the ones I sent you. 
This relies on me mining a block before anyone else. No one is going to invest that much time/money/effort just to rob Starbucks of a cup of coffee. Also, this is a very, very obvious attack.

"Since the block hash values are arbitrary within the difficulty range, and those values are contingent upon the transactions contained within, it would be impractical to prove the block chain has ulterior motives beyond storing transactions."
Basically, the only 'discovery' value would be finding nonce's that work for the data in the block to fit Bitcoin's protocol. Those have no further value, by definition, as they only apply to the specific block data in totality.

What are you talking about? 90% of the block size arguments do not understand block size.
The transaction 'cap' is just the number of tx that fit in a block. It has nothing to do with whether or not tx's are valid, accepted by miner's, or double spends. 
If there are more tx than fit in a block, they wait for the next block. Oh no, everyone panic. 
This is such a far off nonproblem. The 3.5t/s (7 theoretical) cap does not limit the number of broadcasts, only how many fit in a block. Worst case: Tx are backed up multiple blocks. Big Deal we'd probably need a power of ten increase in transactions to have to worry about that.

Because the block 'real estate' is also subjective to economics. The folks who want to keep it arbitrarily small are making a flawed economic argument. I.e. hobbling block size to increase demand. 
It then turns into a function of economics where a clone that does it better could usurp the original but it would also have to subvert all the entrenched market share. 
I like your analogy because it does a good job of showing that flawed argument. If miner's don't like fees it just means they sell the hardware for cheap. Then we hit secondary markets, tertiary, etc.

Upward mobility is not a measurement of wealth.
In the US, if you are born in the bottom quartile you have a 70% chance of experiencing upward mobility. If you are in the top quartile you have a 40% chance of moving down.
Also, like you said, the standard of living increase you cite was because of slaves increasing their standard of living. Basically, coming onboard with where everyone else was. That really didn't affect the Standard of Living at all. In fact, it can hurt it until the economy adjusts for the new labor and resources entering the market.
You also ignore that in 1907 the private banking system failed when the Knickerbockers tried to manipulate the copper market and other investors stopped by with an influx of capital. That failure led Woodrow Wilson to signing over control (Read: Nationalizing) the banking system in exchange for JP Morgan bailing out the system.
Morgan sent a crony to Europe to learn from their fractional reserve bank and in 1913 brought it home as the Federal Reserve.
All that happened without a central bank or IRS. If the system in 1900 created the federal reserve then why would you expect it to do anything different now?

The majority of POS devices run on a PC of some sort. There aren't many embedded or specialized systems I'm aware of anymore, at least. 
Again, with NFC you are talking about a small market. Of the 1% of customers who may pay in Bitcoin maybe .01% will use NFC. So, why not buy an NFC reader and keep the current POS instead? Since you'll need one anyway. 
If I'm a business owner I am going to ask you why you are designed a point of sale around .0001% of my customer base. We aren't talking past each other, you aren't selling me.


So what's the difference between holding the camera over an image and holding the NFC reader over the NFC thing? They're even located in nearly the same place on the phones.


There are, literally, handfuls of NFC APIs for web languages. This one is specifically for chrome and written in javascript. 


So you're just mimicking the QR process? It's the exact same only you want to use NFC?
I guess, and here is the only question that really matters, why would i upgrade my current system to one that does the exact same thing but serves .0001% more users? Why when I can spend the same amount buying an iPad, signing up for Coinbase or Bitpay and then I have an iPad I can take home with me. 
There's just no need in the market for this and I'm still reeling from the PTSD you brought up when you said a POS was not a heavy lift. I have five years of memories that disagree with you. 
Effectively, you are building for a specialized device. You may as well call them an embedded device since you are building a point of sale for the raspberry pi. You are going to run into so many problems. 
1.) What if the pi breaks down? Who do I call for support?
2.) I have to buy something more? Why can't I use what I already have? It's not like a RaspPi POS even needs desktop hardware
3.) There is no demand for this in the market.
This is flavor, mostly to say you did it. A weekend hobby project, sure. A business, no way. You are in the payment processing business with this, not the point of sale. Coinbase and Bitpay already beat you to market.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:48:59

Banks would want to deal with Bitcoin to provide services if the banking industry resembled anything remotely close to a market. "Within Law" with respect to the banking industry means "embedded politicians."
Seriously, what do you think the up front and maintenance costs of implementing a Bitcoin solution would be? How long do you think the return on investment would take?

The only reason modern feminism exists is because the establishment it rails against created the environment for it to exist. Without 'the Patriarchy' mdoern feminism wouldn't even be a thought. 
So instead of putting women down, and coming up with reasons why women aren't attracted to fields, maybe examine women instead of the men in that field. Although, modern feminism is a wonderful representation of a group of people who fail to take any accountability for their actions but want all the benefits of doing the work themselves.

Let's replace all the male day laborers with female laborers. Let's replace the boilermakers, the roofers, the truck drivers, the construction managers and replace them with female counterparts.
Now, let's take all the nurses, receptionists and secretaries, day care and kindergarten teachers, the social workers, the housekeepers and replace them with male counterparts. 
Let's rewrite the laws and give men the same privileges women enjoy. Want to marry a man? Be prepared to give up 90% of whats yours to part ways. Want to see your children again? It's at his discretion. If you so much as lay a finger on your husband - or even if your husband decides to tell the cops he feels threatened - you will be removed from your home and possibly never be allowed to return. If you tell the cops your husband hit you, they will laugh at you and society will say you are "not woman enough" for them to care.
Furthermore, men will now have the ability to go back to any sexual encounter and withdraw their consent after-the-fact, just like today's women. If a disaster occurs, women go first. If a ship is sinking Men &amp; children first - Women stay behind and sink with the ship.

I associate Coinfire with a Fox News or MSNBC level of quality. 
First, You linked to an article in this one that belongs to a site where the editor is one of the main GAW pumpers. [See that guy on the far right]( - That's [Scott Fargo]( huh. Wasn't Coinfire spearheading the whole "All the other news sources are corrupt but us" angle? How do you reconcile that, while citing those same people's work to validate your own?
You're going to give us a buzz word or phrase in the title
Your source is equivalent to "[Some People Say](
At the end of the article you will share how it's not 'really' what the headline says but it's kinda close, right... Guys?... guys?
You'll link to at least one other 'source' of news that repeats the same rumors as you.
Ironically, a few months ago you were chastising other editors and news organizations for their lackadaisical GAW coverage. 
In 5 minutes I was able to poke more holes in your story and your organization than your article speculated on 'anonymous' sources.

I don't understand your question? Was my 0 to 10 metaphor cloudy? 
There are far more people on this planet who still prefer to trust an individual or establishment than software. This has the potential to move people along the path from 0 to ten. 
That you don't trust him is irrelevant. That sentiment is painfully obvious especially with regard to where the comment appears. 
If we take Bitcoin seriously we should be supporting all of these efforts. Not just the efforts we perceive to be 10's. 
Whether it's spy resistant or Kim resistant doesn't matter. It's Bitcoin-related and has a positive vector. We should all be sold. 
This is my exact point about millenials. I don't like saying it again, I don't actually know if you are (a millenial), but it's a perfect expression of the sentiment I am speaking to. 
The parts of the Internet that worked - that survived - were the ones built on support. They weren't the ones built inside silos hiding and shunning everything that didn't fit their narrative. 
Even if none of us would use the service, it's still a great thing. I don't know what has happened, but we've gone from a community that realized "Actually, this is good news" to one of "I need to find a way to inject my personal opinion and make some hipster point."
Because that's all it is. It's self-serving. It's short-sighted. 
His engagement is the point!
Bitcoin is not a software battle it's a change in human behavior. It's convincing people to alter how they live their lives. It takes culture, leadership, example, engagement, education, so many more things than software features or requirements.

Sure it does.
'God', a la theocracy, is a hat tip to the past paradigm - what came before the age of governments. 
Roughly, consider -&gt; hunter/gatherer -&gt; warlords -&gt; monarchy -&gt; theocracy -&gt; democracy. It's a progression. All of them serve the exact same purpose:
Promote a small, special interest, group's interests at the expense of everyone else. Part of progress and that civic life cycle is retiring the old ones when they are no longer necessary. Since humans aren't machines these things linger, and technology and innovation don't reach the same places in the world at the same time. So, anthropologically, we have all these different 'eras' existing at once. 
In the west, Monarchy/Theocracy gave way to a Republic that warped in to a Democracy due to tyrants and world wars. Even though Democracy existed on the Earth before it did in the US that was our progression. 
It's sort of natural for the new order to ignore the old. That's the way of a conqueror. Why rile the hornet's nest? Let the churches keep doing exactly as they want so long as we collect taxes. Hell, exempt them from taxation since their power is waning. That will keep them from attacking us. Perhaps the smarter ones will align and support us, we'll favor them as their peers go extinct.
Bitcoin technology will give way to new governance paradigms post-Democracy. Governments will go the way of the church - always existing. Hell, we may even let them keep their sovereign currencies and levy taxes on us even though none of us use those currencies or, technically, live in side their made-up and imaginary borders. We'll just wait until tax day, convert some coins to government currency and be on our way. Eventually generations will change and people will say "Why do we still do this" and give up on the systems. By this point there will be no power to force them to continue paying.
Eventually those who still carry the statist flag will fracture, divide and disagree with one-another like the church or socialism or any other failed civic. "First National Reserve Bank of the Federated United States of Social Justice"; "The Federated Banking Reserves of the Nation of the United States."; "The Democratic Confederation of Mutualist Money Servicers" - just like religious sects decentralize. 
That's how the nation state will die. And that's the hat tip Bitcoin will make in its future, much like the Fed tips its hat to the governance system that came before it.

With how the decimal works on bitcoins we could lose 99.99% of them we could still save it.
The decimal can be shifted left and right so many places (I don't know off the top of my head). 
So if only .1 bitcoins remained - the rest are lost or destroyed the protoco can be changed to move the decimal point so that .1 becomes 100,000,000 or some other number.

Waste of time/resources


Can the government do those things? No. They don't have the ability to keep up.


As an anarcho capitalist you're a wantarcho-notcapitalist.
Bitcoin is a direct threat to government because it attacks the funding. Without other people's money government has little power to do anything


If you think government is required for any part of anything that has to do with Bitcoin you are saying violence is necessary for bitcoin. That's all government is. If you believe that, fine. I think you're wrong. Maybe you should stop genuflecting at the altar of Democracy and put more faith in human beings

First, thanks for asking thoughtfully. 
So friedcat is the ASICMiner guy. He predicted a 200TH rate by the end of this year. I think that's a bit high, but let's say he's right +10%. 
At 222TH a 5GH miner pulls .0113 BTC a day. A year at that rate will make me ~$83 after the cost of the miner.
So worst case, it pays for itself then sits around as a commodity. I want it because it's a piece of history and I'm paying to participate in bitcoin. IMO the people selling shovels always make more than the people doing the digging - but those people's shovels end up in museums =)

I just think we have a difference of definitions. 
I think of Anarchy as life itself - the individual being the highest authority. Anything coercive or violent is what I consider wrong. I own the repercussions of my actions and have to interact with other people accordingly. 
My view of the post modernist is smug. Someone who will find a way to bend a view to fit their definition and then tell people they're wrong for not sharing that definition.
I'm OK with all of that, it's the "You're wrong for not sharing my definition" part that gets me. I think its on people to figure out how to work together even when definitions differ. Where other ideologies would force one side or the other in some sort of mold. 
So, for me, Bitcoin is absent force and the ability to regulate or make anyone do with it what one person or organization wills. For that reason I believe Bitcoin is anarcho.

Besides that, they took a risk. It's not like they opened up overnight. Years have gone in to the current BTC infrastructure.
On centralizing - No it won't. Transaction fees are designed to keep mining profitable to a point. It's also designed to be more profitable just to mine instead of forking the block chain.

It IS fundamentally wrong. You are attaching those services to government AND you are letting the ends justify the means. You have zero proof that those things would not be provided by people for themselves if government didn't tax them and have NO way of showing how it is not theft. You cannot justify theft.


Too bad your narrow minded. There are millions of other people who did not consent. Just because you think it's OK to have your money taken for things you agree with doesn't mean you can force other people.


Wrong. This is entirely wrong. You cannot prove anything government spends on anything benefits anyone. Further you cannot show how government increases the value of the dollar.

No, it is not backed by gold, but it was at one point and it's a very interesting history.
The answers to your questions are a bit of a story but a good one if you'll follow me down the rabbit hole. 
At one point the US gov was obligated to exchange dollars for gold/silver. The bills said they were receipts. You could demand the government pay you the value of the paper money in gold/silver. The value of the dollar in terms of supply and demand was based on the value of gold. 
Hypothetically, If a country held 100,000 ounces of gold and issued 100,000 units of paper money backed by that gold then each unit of paper money is the equivalent of 1 ounce of gold. In other words, the money unit has the buying power of 1 ounce of gold. The country would control the supply while the market determines the demand. Together those factors determine the price (yes, other things come in to play too but this is just an example).
You are correct, gold itself is not money. Gold is not backed by anything - it's valued is determined by its scarcity, it's usefulness and the demand (usefulness helps to drive demand, so really just supply &amp; demand). So gold itself has value because of it's uses - jewelery, circuitry, etc, etc. That drives the demand and because the supply is so scarce and difficult to obtain, the price goes up. 
Paper money was invented because it was much easier to use than gold. You can break up paper money in smaller denominations much easier than gold. Transportation was a big problem with gold and it was nice knowing that gold was sitting in a bank, secured. 
When the US and other countries moved to fiat they sold their gold or, at least, stopped allowing people to redeem dollars for gold. This gave them tremendous power - like what we see now. They no longer had to worry about having adequate reserves to redeem dollars and had figured out a way to exchange faith, and the promise of citizens future labor in to spending power today. 
I'm sure you're aware, fiat is just a system of debt. By nature, fiat currency is inflationary and this is the major difference between currency/money. Where the value of a money is determined by gold, or silver or some other tangible good of value (You could back it with anything, really - livestock, building materials, etc.) currency is not. 
I suppose we could say that Bitcoin is a money because it is backed by the miners, mining equipment and effort but you can't actually guarantee the ability to redeem a bitcoin for those things. So it's really more of a currency - but one hell of a good one. It is not a fiat, it is deflationary (which is awesome), and improves on gold in that you can almost instantly trade with anyone around the world. Because of it's design bitcoin is so valuable. 
I'm at work right now and could probably have done a much better job explaining but Hayek's book "The Denationalization of Money" does the best job of explaining it. Actually, it's eerily prophetic in that crypto currency is almost the exact manifestation of what he proposes: 
 
I hope I haven't talked your ear off with this wall of text. I'm an AnCap/EconNerd/CryptoAnarchist/etc/etc/etc so I geek over these things. I enjoy sharing the knowledge since the Austrian school is so obscured from mainstream thought.

I stopped reading. This author is foolish.
He fails to understand that the people who remain jobless are the ones who do not retrain. Anyone who attempts to rely on skills from 20 years ago is taking a risk. 
Same applies to jobs that would be filled with robots. That human labor is freed to go and do other things. If the only thing you offer the world is your labor, you have to compete with everyone else who offers that. If machines do it cheaper it makes no sense to force the consumer to pay a higher price as a result of your wage so you can avoid having to retrain and apply yourself somewhere else.

For the market open source means a variety of things. It spans a gamut from top quality, multi-flavored, peer reviewed software to made in your parents basement half-broken garbage. 
If it helps, think of it like Linux. It has a healthy market based monopoly. There are still many, many flavors of linux tweaked to meet the needs of the user.
Read F.A. Hayek's "Denationalization Of Money." There is absolutely no reason multiple currencies cannot exist and since this *is* a free market of currencies (wcrypto) plenty of room exists to meet the consumers needs and they should be free to choose for themselves which one is best.

Yes, I mean the organization that robs someone else of their money to make bombs to drop on foreigners and the one that inflates the money supply to fund endless wars. Those laws and things hurt people.
**The answer to what would stop companies from doing the same thing those laws and our current government do is that it's the exact same thing we have now.** There is no difference, your "argument" is a non sequitor as well as a red herring. You're asking someone to make a judgement based on a the turn of events in a reality you create that exists only within your mind and because you think you're so clever when someone doesn't give you the answer you expect for the "big shut down" counter argument you've been preparing in your head instead of realizing you're just a dumbass you heckle them relentlessly for your own masturbatory satisfaction. 
**For the second time you cromagnon knuckle drugged slope forehead mouth breakther: The answer is it's effectively the exact same thing. The worst case scenario of Anarchy is what we are currently living in.**
So everyone who advocates for tearing down those structures and returning to a stateless society understands that their is a risk of us ending up right. back. where. we. are. now. But we have at least the tiniest spark of intelligence - the equivalent of a lightening bug on a football field - that is required to recognize that at least with a return to that state of nature there is a chance, even if only for the briefest of moments, where those people in power actually have to worry about the little guy ousting him from power. **And again, for the third time, to answer your question - Because that is exactly what we have right now and the worst possible thing to come out of a return to a stateless, anarcho, society would be to end up right back where we are at this very moment, in this very country, under. this. very. government.**

If I have a cows and you have cows and there is a field.
No one owns the field, it is consider a common. I let my cows graze you let your cows graze. 
If I brought 10 cows to the field and you only had one I am taking a greater share of the common land. 
My ten cows use up more resources than your one cow. At times, my cows crowd yours out and it goes hungry. You complain because it's not fair. I say "It's common land, I have as much right to it as you."
You can:
1.) Get more cows but this might trigger a "cow arms race." You bring more cows, so I bring more cows, etc. Then, soon, there is no field left to graze. The resources are destroyed.
2.) You can destroy my property - kill my cows. I will retaliate.
3.) You can try to reason with me. I will tell you to fuck off, it's common land. 
4.) We invent private property.
The tragedy of the commons is a double entendre. Some people consider the tragedy of the commons to be a loss of the commons. Those people are idiots. The true tragedy of the commons is the destructive potential of human beings when put in situation where they are forced to share. 
Private property solves this problem. I own my land you own yours. You do what you want on and to your property and I do the same. 
How did we go from the commons to private property? Homesteading. People worked the land, made claims and improvements and then had more of a right to ownership than someone who didn't. Who decided that? Common law worked pretty well. 
Bitcoin is purely private property. In the sense that a bitcoin has 1 owner and any time. Nothing about a bitcoin is shared other than data that is relevant to it's transaction history - which has no bearing on it's value. Bitcoin is more like the Gold Rush of the Wild West. Miners staked a claim and worked the land and reaped what they sowed. 
Yes, I think you are absolutely correct. This is just vandalism. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:31:35
I don't know your gma but this is more of a general observation.
Folks who have lived for so long in one paradigm become the luddites of the next. The prospect of investing time to learn something new gives less of a return the longer you are alive. Furthermore, previous generations thought they could get comfortable, learn one or two skills and apply it at a trade/same job their entire lives.
We won't have that 'luxury' because so much awesome stuff is going to be created. 
It happened during the industrial revolution when 'skilled' labor was being replaced by large machines.
There are always excuses because it makes people uncomfortable. The world moves too fast for them and its a face-saving effort instead of outright denial.
The best part about Bitcoin is your grandma can keep doing exactly what she has been doing. The rest of us who are ready to move on are free to do so and neither will effect the other.

It doesn't matter what your intent. That's how it come across. You need fixing and to change, I recommended ways to do that in my separate post. Do that and you'll find plenty of discussion.
Edit* Reading other people's conversations has been the way a majority of human beings have learned throughout time. It's called reading a book. The more I read from you the more you want it spoon fed. 
Here is what I think you want:
Buy two ATI 6990's goto Newegg and find a mobo and cpu and power supply. Get 1 cheap stick of ram and run cgminer. Join a mining pool. Yay you just built a miner. You can tell all your friends you have a bitcoin mining rig. Congratulations. End this horrible thread.

I suppose, and I'm making the assumption based off your last point, that if you consider yourself imprisoned that makes sense to think that way.
It really doesn't require any cooperation on the "fiat keepers" part. You're just saying that right now it is more practical if there is. localbitcoins is a good example but not the solution. Satoshi Square is a good example but not the solution. 
But I never said I would be that person, either. So don't try to make this an attack on me and then say that because I can't innovate the solution on the spot that it's not viable. My point is that all efforts that go towards Washington are wasted. DC is going to do what DC wants no matter how hard someone lobbies. 
I don't want mutual dependency with people who leech dry everything they come in contact with. I don't want a relationship with an organization that is designed to bleed dry any business/invention it can profit from. Government is filthy.

This is not the tragedy of the commons. You just keep trying to make this issue fit that mold. 
You do not understand value or where it comes from or how wealth is created or destroyed. It's OK, most people don't.
BTC is a paradigm shift. You are attempting to judge it by the current paradigm. This is what's wrong. 
Nothing like this has ever existed and made it this far. We can use what we know about the past to help us understand it but there is no "apples to apples" comparison.

Well, I haven't seen an analysis of when tx will overtake the reward in terms of  
But I believe the tx fees are usually ~.4 - .6 per block. So it's not that much yet, we would need many many more tx, probably a protocol change - so a hard fork of the clients - and the price of bitcoin to rise higher than it is now for it to be where we want it to be for miners. 
Not disagreeing with you, you're right. Just tx fees are no where near the mining return right now. Moar Transactions!

Actually the Internet was developed by private enterprise. DARPA net was a missile system that employed TCP. The only similarity is TCP.
Technically, DAPARNET was beaten by the stock ticker, which accomplished long distance communication over one hundred years before DARAPNET came in to existence. 
And even then, government banned the private usage of anything similar to DARPANET for about 25 years. So without government the Internet would probably be a good 15 - 20 years more developed than it is now. So, shit, we'd have even more than we have now.

I always find it interesting how the person claiming moral/ethical high ground always resorts to "You're going to die, hah hah" as their last resort typically after being confronted with reality.
Good to know the progressives are still bottle dwelling scum suckers hiding behind the guise of empathetic, compassionate bleeding hearts.
Truthfully, the worst part is the inability to recognize that perspective is reality. Even more difficult is understanding everyone in the world has a different perspective. That's why it tends to benefit you if you bother to define your terms before casting judgement on someone. 
Obviously, when you hear the word profit you have your own definition and you refuse to acknowledge anyone outside your tiny microcosm of reality (i.e. your perspective) could possibly mean anything different with that word.

That would hurt the value of the coins but overall the price drop would be the result of people trying to get their money out of mt gox and somewhere else.
Some people would get out of btc, others would go to other exchanges, some would sit on it, etc.
There would be a rebound but until that value is added back in some way the price would be lower. With btc's potential that would be a huge opportunity for new exchanges/models for exchanges to open though.
Don't always think it would be bad if something like that happened. We are smart folk, we adapt faster than we can be stopped =)

Luddite was a good word. Just because you don't understand what it means, the implications or the possibilities doesn't mean there does not exist someone who does.
If the original tenants of Bitcoin were to become invalidated it only means that the door is open for someone else to create something better as the demand has already clearly been demonstrated. 
Government is unsustainable as it is. It costs us a whole lot less to prop up another solution than it does for them to shut it down. That's how our ancestors beat the British and that's how you take the incentive out of an occupier/tyranny -&gt; Make it cost more than its worth.

To me, if the wallet is lost or the coins are unspendable for whatever reason they are not in circulation. I know there is no way to define that. 
I'm interested in knowing about unique bitcoins. For example, you and I could send 1 BTC back and forth 100 times and it would add to the total number of BTC sent in transactions. It's still just 1 bitcoin. 
So it's neither. The purpose is to try to get an idea wrapped around how many of the total number that have been mined are actually being used.

400B is a little low to me. Actually it's very low.
I posted this elsewhere before
Napkin Math Time!
Total Gold in the world: ~ 5.6 billion troy ounces. ~$1300 / troy ounce = $7,280,000,000,000 = Total value of all gold available in the world.
Since this is an estimate, I'm going to use the value of gold in the world to determine a bitcoin's price. This ignores everything that makes bitcoin better than gold. It ignores many, many unknowns and is only a rough estimate.
I'm using 20 million as the number of bitcoin since I'm estimating and the final 1 million will take forever to mine.
$7,280,000,000,000 / 20,000,000 = $364,000 / bitcoin
It's not much of a stretch to see how estimates could go crazy but I don't think this one is too bad of one. I think six figure bitcoin is plausible.

Instead of being forced to lobby government to rig the game in their favor eventually they hit a point where their savings/investments are doing more work for them than they can do manually.

I would send any balances on my crypto wallets on windows to their linux counter parts. Destroy the old wallets.

His Response:
Hi Alex,
Thanks for taking the time to write. I'm not sure about the historical accuracy of your analogy, but I guess I'd ask what's so bad about anti-money laundering rules? However you view government regulation, it seems fair that we should at least keep an eye on the criminal usage of the financial system. Surely we agree that disrupting the financial activities of criminal organizations is a fairly worthwhile use of state power? It's not clear to me where the slippery slope is in this case. What's going to follow from this that will harm the development of the bitcoin economy?

If you think those regulations help you, you are a fool

The number of these posts when the price was rising was tremendously lower than now. My scapegoat is the influx of statists that the rising price attracted to Bitcoin. These folks don't give a damn about the principles they want easy money.

It seems reasonable to me that someone would acknowledge their question as being one that has probably been asked before and then take it upon themselves to find the answer.
Instead this question reads as 1.) Hubris for thinking no one else has ever had the thought or asked this question, 2.) Ignorance for being unable to figure out the answer yourself (It's not that hard) or 3.) Laziness for not giving a damn and expecting someone to answer you here.

That's Keynesian and it is wrong.
When your currency is going up in value you tend to save, saving is good. 
Inflation mindset:
This money will be worth less tomorrow. I need to spend it today on something tangible. E.g. I gotta get rid of this shit before it's worthless.
Deflation mindset:
I need to be careful to only spend on what I need to make sure I am keep as much of my wealth as possible. E.g. This is is valuable. Business better come up with a sweet product to entice me to spend or I'm just going to hold on to my shit.
Edit: More to come, I'm eating lunch
Ok here's more.
Inflation increases the cost of goods. If the value of the currency goes down, you have to spend more to buy the same things. This also means your wage is devalued. If you made $100,000 last year and the supply of currency is doubled then in this simple situation you may still be making $100,000 a year but your buying power has gone down to $50,000. E.g. A snickers bar prior to inflation may cost $1.00. Next year, after doubling the supply and halving the value of the dollar, it would cost $2.00. This is ubiquitous. A $100,000 home now costs $200,000, a $20,000 car is now $40,000, etc.
Deflation drives the cost of goods down. If the supply is constant but the demand increases the value you get more for your money. This is what we have seen with Bitcoin and a huge part of why it works. A 10,000 Bitcoin pizza a few years ago now costs .17 BTC. 
At it's core, this is the Keynesian vs Austrian school of economic thought. The currency/money supply is a physical manifestation of this constant battle. Deflation encourages savings and enables people to acquire wealth. "Hoarding" is what is happening now because the ability to invest bitcoin is small. 
Let's look at ASICMiner as an example. Sure, you could have held on to your bitcoins last August. If you did you would have the same bitcoins then as you did now. But if you invested them you are accepting a level of risk for a chance at a return. In turn, entrepreneurs have access to capital to invent and innovate. Through innovation new things are created that increase everyone's standard of living - more things exist to spend bitcoin on. Everyone's standard of living goes up. It wouldn't have to be ASICMiner, it could be a car company or food or technology. Because the consumer's money decides who gets to create we see products and services enter the market people actually want.
In an inflationary system the entrepreneur has to get permission from a bank to have access to that capital. The power is consolidated with people who control the money supply. The players at the top tend to stay at the top, the mobility between income brackets is diminished and you're encouraged to take high risks because if you don't the money will be mostly worthless. 
Take a look at bond returns. If I am correct (I haven't look in a while) the return on treasury bonds is lower than the rate of inflation. There is no incentive to buy a bond because you are literally going to lose value. 
It's sad to see people continue to argue for Keynesianism. It's a form of serfdom where you are forced to work harder, longer and for less each year. At least with a deflationary currency you have a lasting proof of the value you added to the world.

The bitcoin community was built by people like me. You're our guest. You will not get far.
@_date: 2013-05-16 04:39:46
You really need an economics textbook.
It's not difficult to get bitcoin, at all. In fact, it's one of the easier things to do if you aren't &lt; 13 years old and don't have access to a bank account. 
A government sponsored pump and dump is pretty hilarious, but you should really look up how that actually works. I mean, more than 5 minutes of your time will get you to a point where you go "... Oh... I see how wrong I was and how obviously ignorant a statement that was"
In fact it would probably do more to put money back in people's hand. Regardless, that's a gamble at best and government doesn't gamble. It puts its boot on your throat and steals. They only want sure things. If they can't send their goons in costume with metal badges to stomp it out then it scares them. 
Government would fail miserably at any attempt to stop bitcoin. You should look up how bitcoin works. Again, more than 5 minutes of your time and you will go "... Oh... I see how ignorant a statement that was an how obvious it was that I had no idea what I was talking about." In fact, approximately 73% of total bitcoins are being hoarded right now. The block chain has been traced back to the first miner, they've got over 1 million bitcoins in their wallet alone. Some people speculate this is Satoshi himself (themself?)
An attempt to ban bitcoin would validate bitcoin. It would be like government saying "Yes, this really will disrupt our ability to fuck with the currency supply at our leisure." Furthermore, they would fail miserably. Even if, on the outside chance that they were successful at hindering bitcoin, the whole point of open source is to adapt and change. You need to look up the history of crypto currency. It's something call iterative development and government will never keep up the pace - these people still think the internet is a series of tubes. 
You are basing everything you are saying on the false premise that government has real power. It's an illusion. Get yourself a government job, or because I think you're pretty young, shadow a government job. It mostly consists of inept buffoons who knew someone and they want a cush job that requires very little work and oversight. There is a reason why government does not develop anything useful, especially technology. Before you say "The Internet herp derp" Government banned the commercial use of the Internet for half of its life. Imagine where the Internet will be in 20 years. We could have that now if not for government standing in the way. Not only that, but a stock ticker network spanned the US in the early 1800s long before any sort of networking even existed because of trade and free enterprise. The second half was entirely Capitalism that made it what we know today and the only reason it was opened up was because government thought it was worthless. You think those people stand a chance against a network that is more powerful than the worlds top 500 super computers? Dream on.
Finally, here you need this: 
Even if government bought up a high percentage of bitcoin and destroyed the wallet that would only increase the value of the remaining bitcoin. But that would still funnel billions back in to the hands of the people who earned the money in the first place. Furthermore, bitcoin is designed so that the decimal place can be shifted. Even if .001 Bitcoin is left in circulation the protocol can be changed to turn that in to 100,000,000 or so bitcoin. 
I don't think this is for you and you stand to lose a lot of money and resources and will be left with a bad taste. Largely, Bitcoin is based on Anarcho/Libertarian ideals. It makes sense to us because we are at a point where we don't see the government as something necessary to life. In fact, it hinders life. You strike me as someone who enjoys what government bribes you with using your own money. You should stick to your safety nets.
Watch this: 
It will rob much of the power stolen from people by governments and give it back to people. There is no way the US government could police the entire world's computers. Bitcoin is not proprietary to the US. It was a world technology that exploits the weaknesses in the current system. The BEST, and I am serious, BEST chance government has is to create a competing crypto currency - and I already covered how shit they are at innovating, even when they hire contractors. In fact, Amazon is trying to create its own cryptocurrency and failing. Bitcoin is just too far ahead already. The genie is out of the bottle.
You picked the wrong thread to spout off your gut feelings about what your emotions tell you. You might get lucky if you put your bullshit in your back pocket, meet someone willing to teach you, shut up and learn but the amount of hubris and blind stupidity your shown in this thread really makes me doubt you can do that.
Power structures change. Throughout history this happens time and time again. Instead of being a dick maybe you should take some joy in knowing that you are alive and have the opportunity of participating in one of the greatest paradigm shifts in human history. Liberation through technology.

I know you had to look that up. So I'll use smaller words


You posed the Canadian system as the authority. You said that because Canada gives out student loans and college prices aren't raising insanely in Canada then it must be possible to give out loans without raises in prices.
That's not an argument. That's an appeal to authority. 


You didn't make a counter point. You made an appeal to authority.
If person A sells a product for $100 and you have a range of people who can or cannot afford it. There is a spectrum of consumers. If government says "We will guarantee anyone buying that product will be given $75" then person A can raise the price up to $75 and still have the same consumer base. If they raise it $60 then they may gain a few customers. If they don't raise it at all they have to provide the same product to more people - but now their tax money is subsidizing those consumers. So they have to raise the price. This is econ 101 you tit.


Obviously I know more than you do. And yes, Lays ties to the Bush family (and the fact that he was such a huge supporter of his campaign - what are you going to tell me political kick backs and lobbying don't exist now?) are largely responsible for Enron. It's called nepotism you dimwit.

Further your shallow and demented nature is made obvious by your inability to realize other people judge value separately than you do. Perhaps I have thousands of BTC and just want to let this user decide where to spread it around. Or maybe I took it in to consideration that it was a low amount and only wanted to make the point clear that I appreciated their sentiment. Further still maybe I just collected that that amount through faucets and free offers and that was my first time ever using bitcoin and I verified because I wanted to be sure it went through or to make sure I was doing it correctly.

I see you ignored this sentence: This ignores everything that makes bitcoin better than gold. It ignores many, many unknowns and is only a rough estimate.
But since we are nit picking!




So you ignored this sentence too: Napkin Math Time!


They are both stores of value. Switch out estimate and replace it with baseline if that helps you.


IMO people jump at the chance to point out minutia to make an excuse to talk and feel like they're contributing.
Gold 2.0 is an excellent metaphor for bitcoin. Of course, the finite supply, means of creating/acquiring it, traits that make both a store of value and their divisibility are the major ways they align. 
That's why this was an estimate. Bitcoin offers what gold offers - and more. In this sense it's not unreasonable to see bitcoin replace gold, just as you are pointing out. This is, in a way, a worst case.
TLDR: Spend more time putting things in perspective before going fishing.

No, I think the miscommunication is that the anarchy as an ideology and as a practical application are the same. 
Communists often try to fall back on "Well the original idea behind Communism is..." regardless of what follows, despite hundreds of years of effort, thousands of works published on the thought and how many untold lives that have been lost none of them have or ever will make communism or socialism work.
Marx's lack of a state is just a ruse. The state never rescinds power. It fails on it's face at that point anything after that does not matter.
(It's the socio-economic equivalent of "send your rich millionaire prince all your money to get him out of jail, afterwards you will receive 10,000 times your investment!)
Edit* Or, at least, in the sense that Communism would remove the state is no different than saying "Yeah America is free, the government will just get out of the way." By it's nature the state grows its power. Even if the state consists of 1 person, working for 1 day doing 1 thing it will always, always, always seek to expand its power and never give any back.

The more bitcoin has going for it the more likely it is to continue gaining value. I still think BTC is over-valued ($70 sounds reasonable to me) if you ignore its potential.

This might just be my own ignorance -
Would the protocol be capable of accepting a change in standard? Could we wrap the SHA256(SHA25()) with something else? Like AES512(SHA256(SHA256(()).
 Or would that totally bork mining? It'd definitely disrupt ASICs if it even worked

Literally everyone. I don't care if you road a bike to work. A bank loan/investment played a part in the creation of the businesses, the manufacturing processes, the shipping, the creation of the store fronts that got that bike to you. 
That's why you get interest when you deposit your money. The bank puts it to work making more money. That the US government has been able to waste as enormous an amount of wealth as it has while printing the currency it has it is amazing any bank is able to offer anyone any interest on their investment.

I guess I stick more to the mining metaphor than the co-op.
On the interweb there are bitcoins. Everyone can try to mine them, participate in pools, what-have-you, but this is pure capitalism.
Bitcoins are the resource, mining is the labor. In this sense socialism could exist but it would still be under that anarcho/capitalist umbrella. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:52:44
Good points. 
In this case I'd say bitcoin brings all the strengths to the table it normally does against fiat. It's kind of an "Anything you can do I can do better" situation. However, I don't feel this is an apples to apples comparison.
Resources are being allocated according to what people want - mining. Because it has and is giving a huge return. Consumers have spoken. That opportunity doesn't exist in that form with fiat. If a fiat fund existed that was comparable to ASICMiner (E.g. a bank came in to existence that gave an R.O.E. comparable with what ASICMiner can give) you see fiat being thrown at it. 
Sure, we could fund video games, artists or any other variety of projects through crowdfunding. But the currency is currently being spent in a way that it does the most good. In that aspect it is blowing fiat out of the water. It does that because people with bitcoin are much more careful with their scarce resources and are forced to be responsible with their currency. That's kind of what I mean with deflation vs inflation. If you know it's losing value you just need to get as much stuff as you can as quickly as you can. If it's gaining value you only spend when it's in your best interest. Fiat just can't do that

I don't think you understand what happened.
This customer had a complaint and was complaining about the poor service, lack of communication and all other BS BFL has done.
BFL_Josh (Inaba or whatever) then told that person "You need to publicly apologize to me or I am going to cancel your order"
It's fine to cancel an order for legit reasons - unable to meet quotas, out of money etc. But holding someone's money for 1 year and then canceling it because someone wouldn't apologize to you on a message board for a legitimate complaint is absolutely extortion. Which I believe someone here, or on the board, posted the law which is being broken by Josh.
Edit: Here it is (see d)
United States  Code, Chapter 41 - Paragraph § 875 - Interstate Communication
a) Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any demand or request for a ransom or reward for the release of any kidnapped person, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.
(b) Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.
(c) Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
(d) Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation of the addressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person or any threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

This was my response, sent to author
Hi Tim,
I had some time today to read your article on the compare/contrast of Bitcoin to the Rial. I did enjoy your article but I'd like to share some feedback if you have the time.
This is apples to oranges. You're right. The US strategy against Iran and the Rial is different. Yes, bitcoin is a currency and the rial is a currency but that does not immediately make them the same thing or imply that US motivations are the same for each.
To me, the US position on Bitcoin is more akin to the position it took on settlers in the early American West. Sit back, let the people do the hard work, and then move in slowly, in small ways while over time ramping up the services and tax rates until the towns were either outright assimilated in to the US or they came over willingly - after being bribed with their own money.
This makes your final sentiment "That's not so bad, is it" More akin to "We just want to put our police in your town, that's not so bad is it?" or "We just want to a small percentage of your wage to help pay for services we provide. That's not so bad, is it?" or "Even though we have never played a part in supporting, creating, developing or investing in this we want a % of the profit and the ability to make rules that govern how you use the technology"
The answer to your question is: Yes. It is that bad. It is the foot in the door that government always puts in place with a market sector it eventually or potentially would like to control. This is quite contrary to Iran. Clearly, the goal is the destablize and harm Iran and it's citizens as much as possible - and we wonder why they hate our government. It's clear that Bitcoin is the slow play. The sit back, let the little people do the work and when it's valuable enough for the US gov to take interest make the push for more regulation, thus more control.
That's exactly why these small sentiments that continue to pop up in the Bitcoin community regarding an embrace of regulation are so important to combat. Stopping it now is akin to seeing an oncologist for a cancer pre-screening - the odds are much better before it spreads. 
Ultimately, government intervention and legislation - from any country - may be an eventuality but, fortunately for us, this time the technology and ability is in place to ensure compliance is not. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:37:11
Either this is a very very very layman level of explanation or you really don't understand supply and demand.
There were a number of factors in play that devalued bitcoin.
1.) LTC anticipiation. Lots of people pulled out btc to ltc for the bubble we thought was coming 7/1 with ltc.
2.) USD withdrawals frozen on gox
3.) Winkledouches mainstreaming fund.
USD withdrawals came back. Gox is silent on LTC. Winkleclowns don't really matter that much.
So the bad news is shifting, naturally the price would go back up. Not because of an assigned value

The incentive is there to sell if you can use political favors to ensure monopoly for your market. Then you sell the products that break often that need the most replacing. That's about the only "sustainable" way I can find that works with inflation.
I don't think saving hurts trade. It just forces producers to increase the quality of their goods as people now expect more for their money.

I'm saying it's a ruse. With how you are using "ideally" you can say :anything: and hold it up as an ideology for X. That's what I mean when I use "Hollywood definitions" to describe something.
Ideologically the civic is what is strives to become. That's why anarchy is ideologically and practically the same. The mainstream idea of ideological Communism is a state-less society but that's not true. Ideological Communism is a powerful state that keeps workers content under the illusion of someday attaining a proletariat utopia.

Interesting. 
Maybe you can clarify this for me then. I believe 7tps is the current limit. 
7*60*60*24 = 604,800 Total transactions in a 24 hour period.
What's the total transaction size? I tried hunting it down on the wiki but there is still ambiguity. Regardless, at 604,800 transactions each one could take up 1.5MB before we'd hit a GB per week. That's just absurd. 
The bottleneck isn't the block size. It's the number of transactions we can accept. Until that number is much higher I wouldn't worry about the block chain size

Oh I get it.
Yeah, I consider "Sweat shop labor" to be a pretty good thing. Usually when someone is condemning it they are judging it based on their own standards. I don't think those people understand the alternative to working in a sweatshop is usually prostitution or some other horrible alternative - especially when it comes to children.
So it makes sense to me that people would line up to take those jobs in that area. Especially because most pay more than twice the average wage for that country/nation.
The reality is no one wants child labor. But it's one hell of a better alternative to what they were doing before. People can complain about it, but mostly they're full of shit. They don't offer a solution or when they do it's "Pay them more" but that would remove all reason or incentive to do it. It just demonstrates the lack of economic intelligence in those individuals and an inability to deal with reality beyond what's right in front of their noses.

My original point was deflation increases the value of money, and encourages upward income mobility through savings. You're trying to get me to talk about wages going down and whether or not it become so low that people would be able to afford a living even though the cost of goods would go down.

Effectively they do the same thing.
Money is backed by something tangible. USD backed by gold is money. Currency is not backed by anything tangible, mostly faith, the effort to create it and the way it is designed.
For most people its just a semantic but the convolution was instrumental in destroying the dollar.

Um, I guess I'm misunderstanding you.
You are selling 615 KH for $1,163. I guess you'd still charge a little more for your margins. That still works out to ~.53 KH per dollar.
My $1,500 1300 KH right is .87KH per dollar. I suppose if you add another $320.00 card you could greatly up that density. So it would be 1230 KH for $1492 ~.82KH per dollar. 
Personally I consider my most recent build the bare minimum. The more cards you pack in per board/cpu/mem only increase the KH/dollar. 
For another $1200 I could add 1950KH to just this system and be mining around 3200-3300KH. Total cost would put me around $2700. Upping my density to 1.2 KH per dollar. Now that's a deal - effectively the same as your highest tier.
I'd imagine we're doing the same things, effectively. I just don't understand why you are pricing at cost.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:47:55

You're misunderstanding the question.

What is the total sum of all wallets who do not have a transaction in the past 30 days, 6 months, year, etc. 
That way we'd see the balances that aren't moving. I.e. 6 million BTC are just sitting in wallets and the rest are being traded, moved, etc.

I see this line, constantly.
It's the exact same as the "You won't get any profit from mining" gimmic that's been used for years.
The truth is, there is plenty of return on ASICM. People were saying exactly what you did when it was at 1.5BTC/share.
Some back of the napkin math:
3600 BTC is mined every day.
ASICM has 20% of entire network hash rate.
~720BTC a day. 
At 400,000 shares that is .0018BTC a day per share or .657 a year per share. 
Even at 3.5 a share that is nearly a 20% return. That doesn't even take in to account the hardware sales, of which there are many.
Please, show me anywhere else in the entire world where you can get a 20% ROI and dividends every week?
But wait, what's that you say because I already know you are going to say it "That's unsustainable, there is no way they can keep that up."
Bollocks. They make the mining equipment. They have the funds. They have the resources, they have the skill. 
This is what happens when a person takes a risk, bets big and is right. The purpose of investing is the make your money work. What matters is the dividend and the growth. 
I have no idea how you're making your judgment but I'm guessing you're just parroting what you read on the boards without looking in to it at all

You really need to get a grip. This is blatant fantasy and not based on reality. You clearly don't understand the technology.

I would try to let you save face but no, when you dropped Van Gogh it became a fart sniffing competition.
If by 'minor' you mean small and it wasn't a typo meaning 'miner' I've got a few reasons why these aren't minor variations.
1) The abundance of coins is a better entryway for new people. It's all over every week "hur dur we need to switch to mBTC no one wants to buy a fraction of something."
2) The lower price point is less risky to new people. We want people getting away from fiat. Period.
3) I won't start a pro/con to faster block times. But it has faster block times.
4) You are ignoring the entire network. ASICs decentralized the bijesus out of bitcoin but it also made it possible for mining oligopolies. I don't consider this to be in the realm of reality but a lot of power *could* get concentrated, especially down the road when rewards are low. Yeah yeah, miner fees. Those will never be as good as the block rewards even if the fiat value is someday higher.
5) LeetSauce McGamer UrMomBro can mine. Yeah they can mine bitcoin too but Bitcoin's GPU era did not align with mass adoption/the time when a lot of people learn about it. The return on Litecoin is incredible right now.
The fact remains **we want people to use crypto**. Don't be a fucking asshat because the only thing you have to add is FUD that equates to "newbs beware" just because you read eric vorhees' post about his cynicism to litecoin. 
The ONLY thing you've put forward was a half-thought that equates to "If Bitcoin fails then Litecoin fails" well no shit. So if you bad mouth about litecoin while simultaneously trying to say it's bad because it's like Bitcoin you're a fucktard.
TLDR: This is FUD posted by a newb.
@_date: 2013-10-29 13:20:37
Let me share with you, the words of our lord and savior.
"[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto 
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto 
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
Some claim this quote implies Nakamoto had great concern or contempt for the current central banking system. 
So yeah... I would consider Bitcoin almost essential to capitalism. Maybe not Bitcoin specifically but what Bitcoin enables, certainly.

Ignorance/not knowing what you are talking about is one of the most dangerous things surrounding Bitcoin right now. We need to educate the mainstream.
Honestly, my personal thoughts - most kids are just pussies. I can't substantiate numbers but we attract a lot of kids. The American Millennial is an entitled piece of shit who thinks they are owed something by everyone else. More than anything I hate when those clowns show up, ask a stupid question or cite some dumbass Keynesian logic and then act like I'm the asshole for not politely telling them how correct they are and bowing out of the conversation. It's not defensive, it's telling people how wrong they are in a direct way without regard for their feelings. It's the Internet.

You are talking about organizations that currently exist within the status quo.
Part of the goal of bitcoin is to create organizations that exist outside of the status quo. 
What you are talking about brings bitcoin in to their world. I don't want that and I think a lot of others don't want that. The best solution is a separate bitcoin economy.
When you peg bitcoin to the current economy you are sacrificing all the businesses that could exist in a pure bitcoin economy.

So, so much facepalming here. So much.
In an actual market competition does help to drive price. Producer's do compete, like you are pointing out.
Ford and GM are part of the same messed up American system. Inflation pushes producers to use the cheapest parts, cheapest materials and get it out the door and sold. That works fine so long as foreign markets are held back. That's where tariffs come in. That's why a Toyota is a better car and sold cheaper than GMs and Fords, except in the US where the tariff pushes them higher.
You obviously get the simple economics definitions. What we have is not a market. What we're doing with bitcoin is restoring the market. 
You don't honestly think that GM or Ford would sacrifice the comfy tax payer subsidized cushions they rest on just to undercut each other do you?

You not getting what you want when you want it has nothing to do with the overall availability of ASICs. They are not obscure and they are not difficult to obtain. What you want - which must be a 50GH ASIC a year ago for $1.00 - yeah, that's obscure and difficult to obtain.

Early adopters are rewarded for their risks. You didn't take those risks. You had neither the knowledge, the time, or the inclination to try. You get to live with the repercussions of your actions - that's your right. It is not your right to force those repercussions on anyone else in the name of 'fair'

Napkin Math Time!
Total Gold in the world: ~ 5.6 billion troy ounces. 
~$1300 / troy ounce = $7,280,000,000,000 = Total value of all gold available in the world.
Since this is an estimate, I'm going to use the value of gold in the world to determine a bitcoin's price. This ignores everything that makes bitcoin better than gold. It ignores many, many unknowns and is only a rough estimate.
I'm using 20 million as the number of bitcoin since I'm estimating and the final 1 million will take forever to mine. 
$7,280,000,000,000 / 20,000,000 = $364,000 / bitcoin
It's not much of a stretch to see how estimates could go crazy but I don't think this one is too bad of one. I think six figure bitcoin is plausible. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:58:26
I don't want this to get ugly but I don't think this is grounded in reality.


There is absolutely an American car monopoly in the US. Bailouts, tariffs and policy dictate this. That's why Toyota, despite being a higher quality vehicle and cheaper to manufacture/ship to the US is smacked with higher prices just so American companies can "compete."


It most certainly does not. You are making the assumption that trade for the sake of trade is good. Get that weak Keynesian crap out of here. Trade is only healthy if both sides win. If the consumer thinks saving is more valuable than buying your product that's not a market failure. That's a dilemma the producer has to solve - i.e. higher quality, lower cost, more incentive to buy.

That's basically what you did. You just dressed it up a little bit.
I think you are just digging a hole deeper. If you knew anything about ASIC mining you'd realize that you won't be able to put together a mining rig that comes anywhere near an ASIC... without ASICs.

Everything you cited is political. Government is the only organization that starts war. War is the bread and butter of government.
Private enterprise being viewed as war by individuals is not war. You are attempting to associate one with the other and you aren't going to get away with it.
War on competitors - by innovating, building and creating a better product and having the consumer voluntarily decide for him or herself which to buy - is actually called competition. And it is the healthiest thing that goes on in the entire world. It is the sole purpose for why the human standard of living has gone up since the dawn of mankind.
So you are, in effect, proving my point. 
Governments start wars. Absolutely true. Wealthy people who run business compete. Business doesn't start war because then the money that would be spent on their products go towards bombs. 
There would be more value in the world if all the money spent on war were instead spent buying platinum gem encrusted dildos than bombs. War literally destroys wealth.

Inflation - You NEED to spend them because it will be worth less money tomorrow than it is today.
Deflation - You DON't need to spend them because it could be worth more tomorrow than it is today.
The idea that hoarding is bad is a keynesian ideal. In actuality it is just a way of siphoning money from the poor. Hoarding just means saving. Saving is a great thing.

Someone else said this
Deflationary: No incentive to spend
Inflationary: No incentive to sell
Why, in an inflationary system, would a producer sell you something that's going to be worth more money tomorrow? The only way to stay in business is to build a product that needs replaced. In a deflationary system it's flipped on its head. You have incentive to sell a product that lasts.

There isn't much to know about politics. They're power grabbing assholes. I do know about economics. Apparently you don't?


This is retarded. If someone else can do it better and for cheaper you are short changing everyone because of your **bigotry**. Paint it however you want. You don't want to see other people doing well just because they don't live next door to you. That's fine. You're the one who has to get over it. Not me.


You are very stupid. And it is clear that you cannot comprehend half the words I am using and I do not know how to express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand. You are selling the world short from benefiting from a lower priced good or service because you think the people who live next door to you are better than people who have a different skin color or culture.


It's not a high horse. I just refuse to accept your parsing of your bigotry for anything other than what it is. You would rather see your neighbour profit than know everyone profits. I never said you were wrong. I only pointed out what it was. You're the only who can't get over it. 
Why are you still talking to me? You can try to say it however you want. It won't change a god damn thing. 
You would rather your community save a few pennies than, say, send the job to a country where a child might do the work and be spared prostitution.

Ok first I need to apologize to you if I came across as rude. Recently a large number of people who don't share in the economics bitcoin was founded on have been asking the same questions and starting arguments when they find out bitcoin isn't about hippy communed sharing and playing kum bai ah.
If it interests you read Hayek. He wrote a book on competing private currencies. Cryptocurrency has been the closest realization of his theory to date. 
Basically anything from the Austrian school of econ will make bitcoin and life in general much much easier to understand.

There's something called iteration. 
You see the same pattern occur throughout history with different technology. 
Someone invents something. Someone finds a flaw and breaks it. They succeed or fail. If the idea is good enough someone provides a solution to the flaw. The pattern repeats.
Bitcoin isn't the first attempt but it's one of the best. It 'might' become a standard because it gets its foot in the door first and becomes established but if it doesn't the next iteration of digital currency (next gen entirely) will blow everything of the water.

Point  was my biggest peeve.
"Code to instantly create all the bitcoins"
Whew, it's actually hard to start on it.
* 1 There really is no such thing. If some monster miner was brought online it will only mine coins at an insane rate until difficulty adjusted. Then it could just be turned off and difficulty would be so high it might kill the coin since it would take forever to mine new blocks.
* 2 If some code was forced in to the software it would still require the miners/users to update to that code level. Not going to happen and I'm not an expert in this area but I would bet this would break protocol for all previous versions and just be a fork no one would use.
* 3 I'm not even sure what "no level of decryption could make more coins appear" means. Unless they mean "No more mining would make coins appear"
* 4 It ignores the loss of integrity bitcoin would experience. This wouldn't just shake bitcoin up but would affect all cryptos and probably force everyone to rethink how we architect crypto coins. 
Those are pretty far off base.

The purpose of decentralization is to remove trust/competition/doing something stupid from the picture entirely. 
When multitudes of people work in their own interest towards a common goal the outcome is better than one person. Even if competition is an issue.

Bitcoin is a direct challenge to governments power structure. Especially since the ruling came through that government has the power to inflate the monetary supply and call it a tax. 
Government never rescinds power without massive disruptions. By design Bitcoin counters the measures government could put in place to disrupt. I am still waiting for you to explain how government could use the money it takes from tax payers to destabilize the market. 
Any attempt the US gov makes to disrupt Bitcoin just further cements the effectiveness of Bitcoin to turn them on their heels. Seeing as government isn't very innovative its  weapon is banning/censor through legislation. 
Bitcoin is freedom. Government is not. When two conflicting cultures/groups/whatever meet the more technologically advanced typically destroys or assimilates the other. Government isn't big on being a part of someone else's party and is used to it being the other way around. Politicians are sociopaths. It's terrifying to think what they will do when they are threatened. 
Any action they take to harm bitcoin is proof by induction that bitcoin is working.

You're lumping in private enterprise with government policy. I see you arguing against nationalization, central banking and fractional reserve banking. Of course I agree with this. 
But you still cannot remain honest and say the finance sector does not make money or create wealth or that saving/investing your money does not generate a profit for you. 
My bank, one that exists in the system you claim is punishing me, has made me a great profit. The money I had invested before the proverbial poo hit the fan has scaled well w/ regards to inflation and I wouldn't be surprised to find out I made good money. 
It is absolutely not a theft to offer a service and have someone voluntarily pay for it. If my bank takes some of the profit from investing my money I'm happy to pay it. I would never have made that money investing on my own.
Please stop mixing your metaphors and thinking everything is so black and white. I'll stand with you and agree that the banks working with government are harmful but you cannot say that investing and savings hurts you.

ASICs are a good thing because it is a response to consumer demand.
Everyone involved in bitcoin benefits because of the improved hash rate, the likelihood of a 51% attack goes down. As time goes on, prices come down. Competition enters the market. 
Yeah, you don't get what the early adopters get. That's why they're early adopters. They take risks others don't. That's why some people have had thousands tied up in Butterfly Labs for almost a year with nothing to show. Even when they could have invested in ASICMiner and made mad BTC with that same cash. 
They don't bitch that it's not fair - at least they don't bitch that the community should for some absurdly moronic reason step in and pay the price for their risk.
So who benefits directly? Those who took the risk. Who benefits indrectly? Everyone. Everyone benefits because more wealth is in the world than there was before. That does not make you, me or anyone else less rich.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:47:04
Of course it is.
Greed is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power.
Anything done out of self-interest is done out of greed, whether it be charity or making a profit.
