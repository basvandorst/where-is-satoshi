I remember when I had about 300 bitcoins and they all got stolen from me and I shrugged it off and said something along the lines of "heh Oh well a nerd stole my nerd currency"

Reading everything and not really fully knowing everything it seems like there's an agenda being pushed by one side and coinbase  being punished for trying to prep for what ever way bitcoin goes. And since it's not picking a specific side  this theymos person is trying to make them the black sheep of the bitcoin family. 
But like I said I don't know enough to judge who is right or wrong just in my experience when you see more arguments for why coinbase is *right* and theymos is going to destroy bitcoin and no one saying anything other then that.  You have no choice but to believe it.

Yeah but what's to stop someone from using bitcoin to launder money. 
Person A has 100k they can't put in a bank because it will cause to many questions on where they are receiving the money from.  So they use local bitcoin and purchase 5k in bitcoins from 20 people through local trade.  Now they have 100k in bitcoins they can go and sell though local trade or buy gift cards online or what ever they need. 
That is why people call it a criminal paradise.

I'm kinda new to this.  But at the same time I'm more just curious then I am serious about bitcoins.  Who is theymos. Why does everyone hate him and if he is so hated why does everyone follow what he says/does? 
Reading everything... As an outsider looking in.. it seems there's overwhelming user/fan base support for coinbase and a handfuls on the other end "the elites"  that seems to just not like coinbase?

This is the first step to it not being allowed for gambling.

My thoughts on it are this. 
The current demand is probably an accidental form of market manipulation. 
The price no matter what is going to keep going up and up until the weeks of Aug 1st. I don't know how long before but people will start to sell off ahead of the Aug 1st deadline to get their profit back of what they put in.. Causing it to dip and start  a panic sell from  people by Aug 1st.
After that it will either balance out and resume going up or take a nose dive to hell.
