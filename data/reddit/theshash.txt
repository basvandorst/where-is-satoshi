Wait, are you telling me that the Airlines using COBOL is defensible ?
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:50:22
Your numbers are still wrong. I am waiting for photographic proof. You can't read well? Can't you?

One head of lettuce is 3.5 gallons.
4k lettuces a month: 14,000 gallons per month.
How did he get a permit to draw 14k gallons per month from Cali Water Board?

LOL. Dude you don't know shit about your own stuff.
Your 6kW setup at an impossible capacity factor of 35% produces only 48.96kWh. A single greenhouse of yours needs 250kWh.
You dont have any remaining energy to go around. 
Lol, quit your bullshit.
I wanted this to be real, cause it sounds like an awesome synergistic idea.
BUT YOU ARE FULL OF CRAP.

It was fun and interesting.
I ran my own numbers on the panel, batteries and miner.
Math dont compute !!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:51:30


You still pay upfront for the cost of electricity. His numbers for energy required for his system don't make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:33:47


I will if you post it.
Fuck it. I will write a detailed post supporting you and respond to most comments people write against you.
Btw, I read through all of of them, I like to fact check engineering specially if it is my field. It is fun.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:06:58
Frankly speaking?
I want to believe you. However, after I analyzed the energy used for your miner, your math on the Solar+Battery --&gt; S9 is off.
One question? Why would you have panels flat on the top of the container and horizontally on the sides of your container?
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:34:04
Where is his proof?
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:03:24
You would pay capital costs and O&amp;M costs for the energy.
You don't pay for the premium to be on the grid or if you need more.


Are you doing ocean wave energy using a osmosis membrane? Thought that was super expensive.


Best of luck!

Is this you? Right north of the airport?
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:22:25


Okay.  Even with a capacity factor of 35%(You cant go theoretically higher, forget practically)
It still produces 48.96 kWhs You still need 5 times system to produce 250kWhs
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:03:58
Photgraphic proof ?
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:07:12


Are you using fixed mount or a tracker system. Cause, if you can connect me to your solar designer guy I will pay you to connect me to the engineer who can get something more than 25% capacity factor in Cali. Seriously. 
I am really intrigued, especially on your panel rates. You got a 1MW system for &lt;$0.45/W
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:40:29
Please ban this guy.
Such an attention whore. Other than his system, his math and energy analysis is wrong.
Solar mining is super possible, but this guy is makibg up things.
He can't get the size for his green houses straight. He can't get his energy use straight.
He claims to have a DCDC system but then talks about getting inverters. I think he is running a business but it is all played around.
His main thing is buying and selling miners.

6kW panel: At 25% capacity factor(very very high for a fixed tilt system) Will produce: 13,140 kWh annually. Approximately 36kWh. This is w/o efficiency. Assuming 98% efficiency, brings 35.28kWh.
Your S9 miner uses about 1.4kW*24 = 33.6kWh. 
Which barely matches your use. Assuming that you are able to use the energy and store it in the battery:  15 pack: 72kWh assuming an 80% DOD, 57.6kWh can be stored. Assuming charging and discharging efficiency for 12 out of 24 hrs. 33.6/2 = 16.8kWhs used in the day ---&gt; That means remaining energy is 18.48kWh --&gt; Applying inefficiencies ---&gt; 16.68 kWh:
Now that barely matches the demand....
That makes me doubt your numbers.


Your drawing was way too hypothetical. No one would put an all side facing panel. All would face south and that's it. If they face anything else, that makes no scientific sense.


If you look at my post(s), I have been working with a solar developer. I now design 130 MW systems. Firstly, the sunlight maximum is 34% of the year. That is the MAX light you get, that to at Maximum Power.

I got a quote from a tier 1 manufacturer for 6MW project and I got a Q4 2017 price of $0.50 per watt.
How the hell did he get this rate?

Look man, show me numbers and facts. I went through your posts.
One place you say you are solar + battery standalone, the next you make stuff up.
Also, you did not respond to the location. If you can confirm that your location is the one I pointed in the map, then I may start accepting your numbers.
But from a direct Solar+Battery+S9 miner comparison, your number are bullshit mate. Either that or you don't know the actual numbers and you make numbers up.
If you had the info, you can just post it. Lets see If you can deliver. I doubt so, also I hope you pull the stick out of your ass.

[I am super confused about how to go about finding suppliers for this VERY tiny test. I have a 60 square foot greenhouse. I am running a small swamp cooler in the greenhouse. The swamp cooler runs between 40 and 80 watts. I plan to run it 24/7 nonstop. This is the ONLY thing I want to run. There will be no other electronics connected or running.
Every supplier I contact in the US tells me that I need this system: (3) 260 watt panels..a total of 780 watts (1) 40 amp charge controller (2) AGM lead acid batteries...6V / 220ah (1) mounting kit for both panels ** all cables
The cheapest price I got for this is $2,500. Ummmm....what...? Is that for real? An average of 60 watts running 24/7 in the middle of the desert (ONLY running during the summer) is gonna cost me $2,500? And...I need 780 watts of panels for a portable swamp cooler? ](
[Also, for every $3000 we use to build a greenhouse, we make $900 per month in net profit. Each greenhouse is about 120 square feet. We have enough land for about 10,000 greenhouses](
No. I included that. Each farmhand can handle thousands of plants of this type of crop. The main labor cost is cutting the plant and putting it into the trimmer.
30 small aeroponic plants produce 1 pound of dried bud. An 80 Sq foot greenhouse. We can fit it 400 of these plants in the greenhouse. Each farmhand can manage many of these tiny greenhouses as a full time job.
I based those numbers on our system. We are aquaponic and more efficient than most. You can do it with nutrient solution for about $10 more per pound. Maybe... $15. But still...cheap.
[You do know it is a weed, right? It is a little harder to grow than basil. And does require trimming at the end. That is why you need the trimming machine. Otherwise your labor is very high.](
[This new farm is to test growing using sunlight in a climate controlled greenhouse that is cooled by solar powered evaporators and 69 degree well water that is misted throughout. Our main farm uses no sunlight...only LED and ceramic lights. Our main farm has a solar array to power it. All permitted. All legal. The new test farm will use this new method. Much less solar. About 300 watts per greenhouse. This farm will not be used for bitcoin mining. That can only happen on our solar array..because we need air conditioning and LOTS of power for the miners.](
