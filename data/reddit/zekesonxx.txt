Their backups are encrypted with the same password you use to decrypt it when logging in. Puik published somewhere how to decrypt it yourself if blockchain.info were to ever go down, so you could get your priv keys and move to a different wallet.

Not really. BTC Guild just has a lot of avid miners, and a selection of the total have the new Butterfly Labs ASICs.

First of all, it will take over a hundred years for all the coins to be mined.
Secondly, way before that will the profit from the transaction fees will be worth more than the profit from the blocks.

The way the bitcoin network works is that the majority of users must decide to change for the network to change. If they want to outlaw addresses that start with `1can` (for example) the majority of the bitcoin network must change.
It's why decentralized systems take so long to develop. They have to be sure that the network is secure and bugfree, because if it isn't changing it will be hard.

Even with the K on the end it was still a valid address.

So does Android.


Don't have a official app? Use one of the third-party developed ones.


Name these apps. Do so now.


Android has a fast camera. No faster than iOS's at least.


There are 3 inch Android phones.


Your post is just plain incorrect.


Which means lots of big, official apps get prime and center and smaller apps get much less coverage. Additionally, they're our devices and we have a right to use them the way we want. If Apple devices don't offer that then we're not using Apple devices.

Bitcoin mining is constantly generating SHA256 hashes and then seeing if they work. Think of it like coping and printing out a $25 bill, and then trying to spend it at Walmart. You won't succeed 99% of the time. Now do this millions of times a minute.

Please make a store that sells normal things and doesn't go all GAH over it's bitcoining! Please just make a normal webshop that sells something that isn't all "Look at me I accept bitcoin!"
Too much of the market is itself. Bitcoin needs to be used for more than buying bitcoin memorabilia. Look at Namecheap, they started accepting bitcoin and *DIDN'T* make a fuss over it. Be like them, don't make a fuss over it.

Your parents will most likely try to steal this from you. Protect yourself. If you haven't yet, enable 2-factor auth. Disable any 2-factor caching, I know Coinbase lets you not need it for 30 days, make sure it isn't allowed.
