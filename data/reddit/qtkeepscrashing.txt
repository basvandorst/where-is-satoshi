Think BTC made by AI?

Hm, electrum ONLY allows for their seed generated.. while I can import a wallet, they won't generate one without a seed. Odd...

What are the chances someone cracks a 12 word brainwallet from electrum's dictionary? Have there been security audits?

What do you mean "actual soverignty"?

Ok, will I be able to decrypt the wallet with the same password I used from Armory?
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:56:17
Yeah, cool.

I generated my address in Armory.. and Armory launches Bitcoin-QT to scan the network.

No, are those in wallet?

Reddit, is there a "community investigation of Bitcion as potential means for social progress?"
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:13:42
I agree with . Ridiculous fud indeed.

However, new Bitcoins are created at an ever-decreasing rate, and once this reaches zero in 2140, the number of Bitcoins will remain static. When this occurs, their will no longer be an incentive to maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin transaction system although it is thought that transaction fees will be levied.

Why and how would a fridge pay for electricity? How would it have BTC to pay for electricity?

I think people will want to buy from children the same way people like to support "independent" brick and mortar franchises. Help them survive and expand into something great.

Ok, I found it, its pretty gibberish looking, that would be because its encrypted from armory I suppose? So I guess I can transfer this to ac omputer and decrypt w/ the password.. TY

Theoretically the network could roll back the transactions though, if there was consensus.

Bitcoin was invented to make fast, low cast transactions between mutually untrusting geographically independent parties.
Banks could function as wallet-keepers, investment advisors, loan BTC for your mortgage etc.
