I paid $17 to transfer $100.
That fee is similarly worse compared to international bank transfer charges....(which has a minimum $25 charges)

Hardware wallet is the best way to store the crypto. 
If not, paper wallet. Make sure you create the private and public keys in a offline computer.

Under right circumstances even that one scammer has the ability to manipulate the entire system.  Its like one guy having a machine gun with hundreds of thousands of bullet rounds entering a peaceful town with 10,000 people in it.

Yeah they had this for a long time. I bought one gig using bitcoins last year.

Nope.  
The transaction charges are higher because cryptos in general are extremely volatile. 
Not to mention, its also a price you pay for convenience. Same reason why water is free everywhere, but when you travel, you usually buy a bottle of water. 
If you want little transaction charges, your best hope is peer to peer. (which is usually risky)

short term and medium term is kind of a dire situation. 
I hold BTC purely for the future retirement plans so I have no problem whatsoever.

uh oh.... 
I don't have any issues with bittrex so far. Do I have to freak out about this? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:13:31
Not 1 BTC, but atleast around 0.5 to 0.7 BTC if the momentum continues...

Well, if you feel that way, don't use fiat conversion then. 
Why do you feel entitled to US dollars and be surprised when uncle sam is coming to you?

God. Even if it goes to $1 billion, it still is  mostly a scam. 
Speculation is not a viable means of using currency. The more that the Bitcoin speculation value increases, the more people will hoard it. If the value keeps on increasing, then people will use it only as a form of speculative wealth creation, and not as a crypto currency. This is already happening now thanks to 5k milestone. 
I literally cashed in $500 out of a few 0. Something Bitcoins I forgot about years ago. That didn't mean it was a sound investment.  I treated this as a lottery.   
Educate yourself on basics of finance, OP.  Enjoy this gravy train while it lasts. Bubble don't last forever.

Bro, just because it costs 1500 bucks  create one Bitcoin now doesn't mean it won't drop below that value.
A dozen or so from the top 1% could literally tank the btc economy if they wanted.

So I am quite new to all of this bit coin stuff and a few days ago I created an account in blockchain.info
Despite all the recent news I am not quite confident in investing money. (Maybe I should spend some more time learning about it I guess)
