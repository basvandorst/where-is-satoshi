@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:57
Thankyou, 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:59
Are you okay?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:51:00
Peasant. I hope you cry when bitcoin gets back on its steam train and you watch it crawl up over that 20k mark.
But in all honesty, wellplayed, not too greedy. I got in at the exact same as you at $6,700.
Dont own as much as you though. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:06:12
218 BTC....
Man, i need that wallet,
P.s your friend is a liar
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:20
Do your research like everybody else,
Oh wait, i must of forgot.
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:03:35
What did you see your fee at?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:55:19
Maybe she wants to buy condoms with his new $25
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:22
We just had the perfect dip for you to invest again.
Im slightly concerned about these tx fees and delays. But future updates and segwit2x fork may provide even better chance for BTC to continue right? BCH whales are soo annoying. Causing all this drama for people. But i now know. From experience. Buy on the dip. And HODL. 
ill get out one day. But its not going to be in 2018,
The future of the technology is still young and growing

I started off on the Day Trading. Learnt alot. Got myself a Nano S. took all my winnings and purchased BTC. I was playing with winning but yes i had to buy back in to try and stay afloat today. Bad bad idea. And playing catchup has also screwed me. 
All a learning curve i guess
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:58:12
Coinbase ma dude
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:48:31
I understand and i was taking peoples advice. 
I thought i had until the 12th before it would pop. 
I was gonna just snipe up some free moneys whilst it grew but it happened soo fast. 
Not only did i lose out on BCH But ive lost BTC too.
I never sold any actual BTC Just money from buying into the stocks
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:51:57
I continue to HODL on my Ledger Nano S 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:55:57
How so?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:45:51
Ive made over 15k in day trading. Im still way up. 
Just todays shenanigans took a sting
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:21:53
I may have not made myself clear. 
I didnt sell any BTC. 
I was on day trading with money in BTC. When it dropped due to BCH dramas. I lost my money.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:50:14
Id be getting your own personal wallet ASAP. 
Because right now you have only a percentage of control over your BTC.
And as you paid for it, its yours. Get something to hold it now. Theres even Apps you can download to have something in the meantime.
What i have learnt is that coinbase should only be for purchasing and you should be transferring it pretty much straight away.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:18:20
No they dont have any of my bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:11:03
Interesting. I use the Plus500 app.
I rarely short. But obviously there are times when short is a option. And stop losses seem to be a nightmare because you giveaway the chance for it to turn around before taking a loss
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:46:38
Cant you just enter all the details, with a photo of the front if neccessary.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:31:36
Because i lost AUD currency, not BTC.
I just had my money on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:49:10
Vertcoin eh
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:35:37
Im having troubles visiting the Website without a big green V covering my phone screen haha
Worth investing then you'd think? I like how cheap they are right now. Getting in early is key i guess
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:48:58
Are you here to bring any constructive feedback or just to troll others on their losses, 
Do you even hodl? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:40:18
What wallet are you using? One on their website? I cant view the site on my iPhone *cries*
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:38:50
I concur
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:52:28
Youve lost me
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:09:02
Im In Perth, working at the mines.
I like the idea of shorting following a long haha. Quite cheeky indeed.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:50:26

@_date: 2017-10-31 09:04:13
