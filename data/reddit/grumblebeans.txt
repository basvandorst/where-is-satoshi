woooo bits!

I believe you, no need to dig it up and good point, thanks

Besides for other things mentioned here couldn't governments just legally require ISPs to filter packets that look like bitcoin packets? Haven't considered this in detail but pretty sure this is possible
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:43:58
Since bitcoin is p2p couldn't they just hook up to the network themselves, discover all the nodes, and then block the IPs?
Someone else mentioned getting around the great firewall of china, but I'm guessing that only works because china doesn't care enough to block VPNs
In any case this is all moot because once a government blocks it bitcoin will never go mainstream. It's too complicated to get around for most people and as other people have pointed out no legitimate merchants would accept it

As far as I know, no governments have decided to ban BitTorrent outright. If they did they could employ the same tactics I outlined

woot thanks! :D

would it be possible for the mods to permalink alternative exchanges on the sidebar?

cool, that's not bad. kinda ghetto but does the job. thx.

Not sure if anyone's mentioned this yet but one reason bitcoin would be really good for porn is that the industry tends to have high chargeback rates. With bitcoin once the transaction is confirmed, chargebacks are impossible...

this comment from the page is on the money IMO:
This is the kind of thing, unfortunately, that brings closer the day when the bankster/gov puppet masters get so upset, that they just declare the use of Bitcoins to be illegal. They have the power to do this, and they will, if they deem it necessary. If that happens, merchants will run for the hills, and BTC potential growth will fizzle out.
I hope these guys are not successful, for the sake of any digital currency's survival. And just like Satoshi did when he stated that Wikileaks should not accept BTC until later (which is what happened,) we need more time for people to learn and understand what BTCs are, and how important they are. Otherwise, at this moment in time, we take a huge risk that might kill the revolution before it even gets started.

Can someone explain why this guy is getting downvoted..?

this actually looks affordable. will call them tomorrow. thanks! :)

Can someone explain why this attack wouldn't work:
1) Create an agent
2) Create a bunch of proxy addresses.
3) Send a bunch of bitcoins to and from your proxy addresses via the agent to establish trusted status
4) Wait until a third party sends a large transaction through your agent
5) Steal the money

hmmm, that's not searchable though. and it's going to get pretty hard to navigate as more stuff is added. i'm thinking more like yahoo directory in the early days of the internet.

i wonder if it's a fiduciary duty thing... like if he bought himself and made money investors would be pissed, but they'd also be pissed if he bought it using amazon's money since there are so many risks around bitcoin

Sure, but governments aren't threatened by the power of automobiles. The US government has historically felt threatened by people's ability to exert control over currency and has taken pretty extreme steps to preserve its power. For example, executive order 6102 made it illegal to own gold bullion (with some exceptions) -

sure, but that's not really a good UI for when there are a crapton of sites.  (which hopefully is what will happen with bitcoin.)

might be harder for amazon itself to do the buying though. imagine if amazon couldn't exit the position quickly enough (mtgox liquidity seems kinda shitty and i doubt other exchanges are much better). investors would be PISSED! :D
