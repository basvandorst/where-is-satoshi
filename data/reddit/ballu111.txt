Dec 2017 Bitcoin $20,000. March 2019 Bitcoin $4000.
Seems like bitcoin is more like bolivar than other fiat.

I never write on these forums so u cant call that bitching. I just dont like pumpers blaming people who lost their hard earned money.

So you think we should invest more money after losing 60% of our investment? You have gotto be kidding me man.

U dont know if it will ever go that high again. I am holding in the same believe and I understand that there is no loss until u sell, just dont blame people if they lost is all I am saying. U can say 'dont invest what u cant afford to lose' but loss still matter. Personally, I dont care about few thousand dollars that I invested. Just dont like finger pointing at people who lost is all.

Don't know about other countries but India definitely did not do anything like that. They did replace bills in an effort to curtail corruption but nobody lost their money!
Stop spreading misinformation...

People may not like my answer but it is kinda true. Someone can create the exact same system as bitcoin or something even better. Why bitcoin is valuable is because we make it so. It is incorrect to compare it with gold cos there is only so much gold in the world and you cannot create anything similar to it (pls don't throw the work of Seaborg cos that's impractical).

I think we agree on most points. Any new cc doesn't reduce value of bitcoin. When I say miners 'believe' in BTC, I meant holistically like they believe in future of the project including financial aspect. I understand why we are getting stuck in chicken and egg problem here!
However, it's difficult to replace Facebook cos why would you leave a good enough social network which is already FREE. Bitcoin transfer is neither cheap nor is it fast. A faster, cheaper cc can provide enough incentive for people to switch over is all I am saying!

Are you talking about US govt?

Arguments like these makes people question bitcoin's legitimacy. You are basically saying that criminals, thugs and corrupt people should be allowed to get away by converting their money into bitcoin and running away to a non extradition country!
It's the job of authorities to keep us safe and punish wrong doers. What is wrong with forced  seizure of property that was illegally obtained to begin with? If someone steal my money, should govt not get it back from them cos that will be 'forced seizure'?

It sounds like an oversimplification of a very complex problem. Access was restricted to ease accounting and avoid people with black money to exchange their bills for new bills using other peoples accounts. Everything is not a conspiracy brother! Some are just genuinely mismanaged efforts.

Like you explained earlier, if people start using something else there will be more users which creates more value that attracts more miners which consequently will increase security! Back to chicken and egg, but I agree with most things you said sir! Have a wonderful day..m

I agree to your point regarding value of a fork. But you don't necessarily have to fork, it's possible to have something new and better altogether. Miners are mining bitcoin today but that can change.
I don't think it's fair to compare bitcoin to Facebook which is a value producing company whereas bitcoin is an asset and/or currency. I support bitcoin and own some and I agree they are valuable. The question was whether they are truly rare which I think is only true as long as people believe in it (miners included).

I am unable to understand what you mean. Ownership stays with who? Like if a criminal have a mil of dirty money, govt cannot seize it?
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:34:10
So dirty money should not be confiscated?
