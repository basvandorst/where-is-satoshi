Let's call parallel blocks "siblings", defined as blocks containing the same transaction (and no other conflicting transactions or double-spends) which cannot be decided to come before or after each other according to the DAG's partial ordering.  In bitcoin these would be orphans.  Siblings must share fees.  This can't be decided until the state of the DAG is known. One consequence is that the coinbase should be calculated long into the future, rather than by the miner when he creates a block.  Bitcoin doesn't allow coinbases to be spent for 100 blocks anyway, I'm going to propose not even *calculating* the coinbase until "100 blocks" (or DAG equivalent) later, when all miners can see all blocks in the DAG-tip.
My exact incentive formula is a bit complex and Reddit is not the place for equations, but look for my talk.

I exactly share mining fees in an appropriate way, and it seems very clear that it will help mining decentralization.  I seem to be getting some pushback on enabling higher transaction volume that I don't really understand -- I think people think we can run a global payments network entirely on Raspberry Pi's forever, which I think is a bit silly.  OTOH you can think of higher transaction volume as a side-effect of getting rid of orphans.
The talks will be videocast and slides put online.  I'll have a paper to follow too.

I will present a solution that eliminates orphans entirely at Scaling Bitcoin next week, look for "Braiding the Blockchain".  (paper to follow)

Reading that log...this proposal amiller is discussing is similar to GHOST which rewards miners who commit to the WRONG ledger state.  As is well known, this decreases the cost of a double-spend attack since the miner can still get paid for the "wrong" side of the double-spend.  The "Inclusive Blockchain Protocols" paper by some of the same authors does the same thing.
My proposal (Braiding the blockchain) discards such work -- I really don't think it's necessary at all when you have a DAG, and does not have that vulnerability.

There are two talks about DAG-chains at Scaling Bitcoin next week, one by myself and one by Yonathan Sompolinsky (who also wrote the "Inclusive Blockchain Protocols" paper -- which is also a DAG).  Yonathan tells me he is presenting new work.
To answer your question: yes.  The DAG structure (I'm calling it a Braid) can allow smaller miners to contribute without joining pools, and I'll describe how that works.  In some ways it's kind of like absorbing p2pool into bitcoin.  I'm publishing a paper describing it too.  Hold your horses, it's coming.  ;-)

Since the p2p layer transmits transactions already, we really only need the header and Merkle tree in any case, if I can reliably get the referred transactions from p2p.

In  I give a simplistic idea for sharding.
