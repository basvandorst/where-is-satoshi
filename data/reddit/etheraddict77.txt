You sold 36% of ETH/LTC/ETC to a private party or on an exchange? A customer that holds ETH can withdraw their remaining ETH, not USD, correct? 
Also please post the cutoff time as soon as possible.

Could you let us know what timestamp your staff is currently processing? I have a withdrawal stampd at 16:12 UTC. I think that would help a lot of users waiting for their withdrawals.

Because everyone is selling? Be smart and hold it. The chance they recover it is higher than 50% but market is being stupid saying there's a only a 30% chance. Smart people bought at 20% (0.2)

Yes, stupid regulators. There is regulation A+ that allows smalltime investors to hold equity now.. are they not aware of that? We want equity! If I had like a significant sum on there I would sue the government / regulators not Bitfinex

Indeed. Especially those considering a lawsuit. All they'd do is shoot themselves in the foot. They should read this: 
Then they would realize that this is new territory here. History is being written. Markets are pricing a debt of a company that would have went bankrupt without this IOU. Chances are good they can recover from this. If regulators see the potential this could be applied to all sorts of bankruptcies to actually prevent bankruptcies. Thats a good thing. Lessons to be learnt here.

Sorry but I would rather listen to Wright than that dude. At least he has interesting things to say... 
I am always amused coming here, Wright is one of the few that gets what Bitcoin is about: Global trade everywhere 24/7 giving everyone an equal opportunity to earn. It is capital at its finest - it is how capitalism should have worked from the beginning, not this crony capitalism with backdoor deals we have these days where the rich keep getting the only good deals and limited access to venture capital. 
Wright gets that better than almost anyone I have seen over the years talk about Bitcoin, maybe even better than Ver. I also get why they pump BCH. It's definitely a complicated and loaded question, whether BTC or BCH is the currency play. In my opinion, the market has spoken on this already but who knows what the market decides tomorrow.

Only that it is not decentralized, open, honest. It is controlled by few, centralized and not something I would call "honest". I have nothing against Bitcoin since we all profit from a high BTC price but saying BTC will increase tenfold is ridiculous. It is an industry just like any other, only that the people controlling it would fit on one tiny stage.
Indeed it has changed the financial world but blockchain tech is the real innovation not bitcoin. Bitcoin lost sight of what it actually is: Software. Software needs to adopt to market circumstances and customer demands. Bitcoin stopped adopting and is not a good fit for enterprises or business customers. I therefore see very little speculative value. You are basically betting on a small group of miners to secure a global currency. That is not a bet I would personally make for various reasons, including energy usage, lack of leadership, lack of ecosystem growth, lack of blockchain applications.
I totally understand your view thou but here is a piece of advice from a seasoned investor: Dont bet the house on mainstream adoption. Invest in the entirety of the crypto ecosystem. This can include tokens, bonds, equity of blockchain companies (bnktothefuture) etc
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:30:14
The premise that somehow blockchains need to be secured by PoW will soon be outdated, then we all here can talk again. That is probably the main reason why I am a BTC bear. It is not sustainable and never will be - one BTC transaction costs as much as powering an entire house for a day last I heard. Overall consumption already more than Denmark. There will be more efficient ways

Piece of advice. Look at other tech like Ethereum and protocols that could get traction - you can usually participate and own a stake in a protocol by simply buying their tokens e.g. DGD, MKR, etc 
However since you only have 5000, you should only invest 500 into 3 tokens and the rest in ETH itself. You will likely see a much better return than investing in technology that will be taken for granted in 12 months. Blockchain transfers will be the norm and aside from a declining network effect there is not much speaking for Bitcoin. 
Some more reasons not to invest in Bitcoin: 1 Heavily manipulated, 2 fake volume, 3 outdated consensus algorithm, 4 politically stuck, 5 no adoption by enterprises or banks (Ethereum has both),6  fringe use cases such as gambling are also declining, 7 capital flight and remittance use case is a big fat lie, 8 high amount of insider trading, 9 incredibly poor developer support, 10 toxic community that only screams buy and excludes all other more profitable blockchains, 11 lost status as general blockchain, 12 lost status as payment channel of the future, 13 no known founding party, 14 incapability to fork due to political issues, 15 heavily centralized, 16 operated to a large degree by China so unlikely to receive support from Trump, 17 Losing venture capital, majority going elsewhere, 18 Not a sound store of value due to political issues, 19 ripe for disruption, 20 never took off in a meaningful way, unlikely to get ETF approval.

Did you mean to say 3 weeks?

Mulvaney and Thiel realize that blockchain is the keyword, not necessarily Bitcoin. I dont know if you know this but Thiel supported Buterin:  
I think it is unlikely that Thiel and Co will support Bitcoin as long as the majority of Bitcoin business is done in China. It is much more likely he will go where the rest of the VC money goes: Into the Ethereum ecosystem. 
At least that is my take on this. They can simply make much more money that way so that is a great incentive to boost Ethereum companies (Consensys, Reuters LLC).
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:47:08
Majority of trading is done in China so they dictate the price.  Also Thiel is not pro BTC, he is pro ETH if anything. Bitcoin mining is also centralized in China. Sure China is big but do you really want to support a blockchain that goes down every time China says the word regulation? Bitcoin will face major competition in 2017/2018 from national digital currencies 
@_date: 2017-01-20 13:36:19
No offense but Trump is bad for Bitcoin. Trump is all about protecting US markets. Bitcoin is a Chinese market (90% trading in China) and not a global market. Most mining is done in China. 
Trump will protect the interests of the US economy and the chances of an ETF have gone to less than 10%:
It is reasonable to assume Trump will bolster blockchain companies but that also means shunning Bitcoin companies.

That is what I am thinking as well. Use any pump to cut exposure. They may not be done for good with their pumping game but for now it is too risky to be in BTC and it is now also a moral question whether you want to participate in their pump/dump scheme

I dont think that is a good idea, regulation will introduce a lot of uncertainty in 2017 so XMR, Dash are not good longterm plays. Also 80% is too much in BTC. I would suggest 30% BTC, 40% ETH, set 30% aside for upcoming ICOs where you will make 1-3k each if you play it smart

Russia has some of the smartest people on earth but their politicians keep stifling innovation. I applaud the EU for not interfering with crypto, thats how a mature economy deals with technology that is not controllable.
