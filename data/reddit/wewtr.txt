If you look at the volume at a high resolution (~5 minute intervals at least), you can see that the volume is generally low, except for huge spikes which are coincidental with the price increases. Between spikes the price isn't increasing.

Look at the numbers of bitcoin on the left side. This "explosion" is only ~300 bitcoins a day, whereas the network averages hundreds of thousands a day

Any deflationary currency will inherently cause people to hoard it. This will be one of the first things any economist will tell you when they look at something like bitcoin, and it sounds like some bitcoiners are rediscovering this fact. This doesn't necessarily mean bitcoin will not be valuable.

I think Satoshi's identity/s is sort of an open secret at this point.

Sell on bump.

However worth noting that the actual amount of value transferred (e.g. in USD) has been flat.
