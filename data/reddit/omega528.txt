That's the point i'm trying to say. when the US abandoned the gold standard no currency was backed by anything anymore. But countries still look at the dollar for reference like it still follows the gold standard.

The main difference is the local Venezuelan currency is backed by the USD, the USD used to be backed by gold and all other currencies around the world backed by it. The US doesn't have to worry about this like the other countries since they are the reference point.
the reason why this is a problem is the same reason why the french took a battle ship to new York asking for their gold back.
Here's an article explaining when and how the US abandoned the gold standard.
also remember the debt reductions only good if people had there money in dollars not Bolivares since they get paid in the local currency the wage there is about 60,000 $13 a month.since everything that ins't local is sold in dollars that's a huge problem.

The US is the one that abandonment the gold standard by printing more money then there where allowed too. Ever since then there has never been a real point of reference for currency since there is never a real limit supply like with bitcoin.
