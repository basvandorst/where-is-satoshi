That's exactly what said: that the ability to track was a side effect that was discovered in the system, which was designed around bank &amp; customer convenience. Once that side effect became known to the authorities, they became quite fond of it, but though they'll defend it or push to expand it, they didn't create it.

This is what we call an *arbitrage opportunity*, or a *market inefficiency*. Situations like this naturally arise in currency exchange markets due to differing assumptions, cultural influences and myriad other factors. 
What's important about situations like this is that those who can move quickly enough can turn them into profit. The process of doing so naturally corrects the discrepancy.
As an example, say 1 bitcoin costs 1000 USD or 1100USD worth of CNY. One would then buy bitcoins using USD, sell for CNY, and then buy USD with CNY. Arbitrage bots would execute this loop until the profit in it vanished — and it would most certainly vanish, as the process increases demand (and thus price) of bitcoins in USD while increasing supply (and thus _decreasing_ price) for bitcoins in CNY. 
The profit one can extract from such an inefficiency depends on the speed with which one notices and then abuses the opportunity until it is rebalanced. For this reason, most arbitrage is carried out by trading bots.

My prediction: 1BTC at the end of 2017 will cost $1586.23. 3LMBcXTdn5hTFUhcFHpwzpeJnyeYY34Hfx

I don't know who "Max Keiser" is, but his name reminds me of "Kaiser", aka "Max Anders".
