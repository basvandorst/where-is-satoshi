is there a worth while way of not tying a bank account to all of this though? say you could accept only certain payment and somehow use that to recycle into your LBC or paxful account? there's got to be a way, I'm just out of that loop atm

well I meant crypto's in general, I suppose we are on the bitcoin sub and I mentioned btc in my example but obviously yea, you're not going to be doing this with the bitcoin. but focusing on the coin is not even the point here. transfer from one exchange to another with any coin you want to and withdrawl with any coin you want to that now has a higher value right.

yea exactly, arbitrage, it can easily be done here, and is easily being done by the millions unless I'm missing something in the middle. easy money to be made no?

well I don't know where you'd be stuck for 2 weeks it's near instantaneous to get money in and out if you know what you're doing. buy in one exchange, transfer to the other and it appears as if you'd make free gains. was just wondering if there is anything in place to balance out this but it seems there is not.
but like you say the gains made may not be worth the hassle unless you have a big bankroll

lol, you call everybody else nerds that wouldn't confront him but for some reason you, just another anon redditor would do something? what makes you so different from the crowd you hang out with online? smarten up. Id say on a generalized guess that maybe 75-80% of people wouldnt do anything, but there is crazy people everywhere, and people who lost A LOT in this shit.
do you think the typical CPU nerd would be dumb enough to fall for bitconnect? not really, do you think the typical CPU nerd would listen to some black dude speaking ebonics about investments? I dont think so. you are imagining the wrong people in your head
