Bitcoin is pretty bleeding edge in the grand scheme of things, 50 years is a long time for bitcoin. In theory, there shouldn't be any reason why multisig would be unable to spend after 50 years, provided you have all the keys.

Yeah that's biology and/or physics 101.
The difference between natural restrictions and social restrictions, is that we really can't do anything about natural restrictions in the same way we can do something about social restrictions.
We can collectively allow or disallow laws or regulations, we can't choose to not be affected by the weather.

There isn't any about covering up the theft itself. They were transparent about being hacked very quickly. Because of the blockchain, they basically didn't have a choice. Any lie concerning that would have been immediately noticeable. 


You don't need regulations to have the safeguards of regulations. Business can opt-in to regulations if it means more business.
When regulations are not enforced by laws, are market driven. This is why many unregulated businesses practice transparency and other characteristics of a regulated market in the absence of all government regulation.


Anyone can do they're own analysis and come up with a pretty accurate estimate of most exchange's total balance. It may be more difficult to be 100% accurate for a few exchanges, but because of the way most of them work and the way the public nature of the blockchain works, we don't need 3rd parties to audit that our money is safe. Anyone can audit anyone's money at any time.

Not a free decision. It's not just a fine, it's a fine backed up by threats of violence.
In the same sense, you don't have a real, free decision to not pay the fine, not pay the taxes. You are being compulsed into doing so.
My point is that the regulations indirectly contributed to this happening. If the regulations didn't exist or weren't enforced, it's likely this money, in this way wouldn't have been lost.

The key difference between the two scenarios is that in Finex's case there is force being used. This is similar to signing a contract under duress (except that it's legal in the case of the government pressuring Finex) "pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act that he or she ordinarily would not perform."
My point was that many decision such as deciding the color of shirt to wear, as wear are non-violent and voluntary.


This is the case then. Just because there's repercussions, the fact that they have 2/3 keys means that they are able to steal the money.

You can do a nlock transaction and just post the transactions after the time is expired. This gives you the same effect and is already possible.

You can send the transaction out to a merchant to buy something with the funds as soon as you get it.
That way, as soon as you spend the money, you don't have to trust the sender and you don't have to give an address that you generated or have exclusive control over.

You're talking about something like [Bitsquare]( A decentralized bitcoin exchange with arbitration.
Even in the 3/3 setup, if 2/3 is necessary to spend, this hack may have not been prevented since both Bitgo and Bitfinex signed off on it.


Only margin equity stays put in the exchange, the rest moves.
There's no point to having a deposit and withdrawal wallet.

From what I understand, this is not the case. There were protections in place. Somehow, the hacker was able to circumvent those protections.
It's a very different thing to have protections defeated than to have no protections at all.

What's the difference of a non-finalized transaction and a non-confirmed transaction?


So in the nlock situation, you would lock all coins.
By adding a clearing period, aren't you just delaying withdrawals? If we're looking for blockchain enforced delays, nlock does this. You can create transactions locally, and when the nlock expires, post the transactions. If something fishy happens, you can just not post the transactions.

That can't really work with the type of exchange Bitfinex is.

It actually isn't required to give out your address.
You can technically send someone a private key, this is easy to do using something like [MoneyPackts](

Bolivar is an exceptionally bad fiat currency.
Just because the US Dollar, Euro, and Venezuelan Bolivar are all fiat currencies doesn't mean they're all the same. Being backed and controlled by different governments is a big difference.

Most likely the price Coinbase shows you is the 'bid' price and not the ask price.
When you go to buy (bid) you are matched with a sell (ask) order which necessarily has to be at least the minimum possible amount (probably $0.01) above the bid price. If the bid and ask price ever are the same, the orders are executed making them non-existent.

Nope. The fact that the security wasn't perfect and it was hacked doesn't equate to "swinging wide open with no lock". There were protections/locks in place.

It's still not completely peer to peer. The exchange that backs up the smart contract is effectively controlling the money.
What would happen if the exchange went out of business and closed it's doors? Would the user still have the bitcoin, just exposed to volatility? I imagine the user does not control the private key.

Many people consider bitcoin an investment. Indeed I gave a pizza delivery guy a $5 tip a few years ago and he spent it once it was worth ~$20.
So you could HODL on to those bits and spend them when they're worth more. Just make sure to withdraw them from changtip and hold them in a wallet that you actually control. A couple good ones are Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, etc.
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:08:50
Does this work the same way for bitcoin mining? It would seem it doesn't.
If a miner mines a bunch of bitcoins that are worthless, and the price changes to $400 a coin that is probably capital gains; if the a miner mines bitcoins and the price is $400, that's 100% ordinary income?
What I'm confused about is the rate of taxation applied. Are both applied?
The quote I quoted seems to suggest that in both scenarios, the miner would be subject to the capital gains tax rate.

On more than one occasion, US Dollars have been confiscated due to traces of drugs on the bills.

I'd recommend either selling it for fiat to your bank account. You can do this at several exchanges like [Coinbase]( [Circle]( etc.

@_date: 2016-04-01 12:36:05
TLDR: No. If the bitcoins are actually broadcasted, they should be visible within seconds. Search the address on  to be sure.
There may be an issue with your wallet software recognizing that it's received money. If you want to be sure, get the address that you think received money e.g. [1JUUnFwWqkcgTi1Ru3FbuaPR8KWBLnLhjd]( and search the address on a [blockexplorer](
It's also possible that the person sending your bits sent them using a hosted wallet that can take a while to actually send the money. If the transaction doesn't show up within 10 seconds or less on a [blockexplorer]( website, it almost certainly hasn't been sent yet.
You should immediately see any transaction that has been sent/broadcasted.

If we can get it so that we make content creators are automatically tipped so that tips can accumulate even before they sign up to redeem them, that has more potential to snowball to something awesome.
It would require some engineering and probably would need a few compromises on true decentralization to work but I think it's doable without too much compromise if done properly.

I envision a world more reliant on multisig rather than either extreme of the average joe's using cold storage or the average joe completely entrusting all of his funds to a third party.
With multisig and a third party, we can have a security model in which no single third party has to be completely trusted, however a 100% compromise of all the user's private keys wouldn't alone be enough to compromise the user's funds.
Additionally, third parties wouldn't be able to single handedly freeze funds by refusing to sign off on transactions since the user could have multiple third parties.

Most investments technically "risk 100%" to get any ROI. If you buy a US treasury bond, it's possible the country could go bankrupt and not be able to pay back.

The issue is high transaction fees. Bitcoin needs to have lower, not higher transaction fees. There's no reason they have to be what they are. The required fees with Bitcoins are NOT market pressures, rather they're somewhat hard coded.

We do that by increasing the amount of transactions then network can handle, not the transaction fees. Give us a tps of 4000, cut the fee by ten fold and you'll have a resilient network. Fill that up and the miners will be happy too.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:33:59
While I think in 99% of cases this is practical, there are some fringe times when this would prevent some things.
I agree users shouldn't be to have a higher fee than the amount sent, but this should be implemented at the client level, not the protocol level. 
Bitcoin wallets should automatically decide the fee for users based on the network so there isn't room for error. 
In order to play around with the miner fee, this should be deeply hidden, either in advanced settings, and/or reserved for wallets designed for advanced users.

If the network is able to handle 20x more trans., it will be about 20x more expensive to  clog the system.

Real US dollar's only have two decimal places. While it's possible to show more decimal places like exchanges do, the real dollar amount rounds to 2 decimal places.

And probably not no, most people would give up the bits at that point. It is fundamentally true that you would have that decision though, which is a good test-case to see who really controls the bitcoins.

I'm not familiar with trezor, but if you can get the private key/seed onto a computer, you can make a transaction with it, and force it to broadcast. Edit: Be careful about where you put your private keys. Make sure the computer isn't infected. Whoever has the keys, has the money. Period.
Don't worry about your money, as long as you have the private key, and the money is still in the public key that's associated with the private key, then you still have your money; you're just running into bugs with software that is making it either not show up, or not broadcast.

Just tried to find it and I had to look hard to find it.
Whoever thought of this UI probably wasn't thinking about the Coinbase app as a bitcoin wallet that someone would actually use to send or receive bitcoins from/to outside Coinbase.
So on the latest Android version, you can scan QR-codes by tapping the top-right hand corner of the screen where the 3 little dots indicating a menu. 
Note you have to be in a 'Wallet' and not a Valut (or any other screen). Tapping the 3 dots brings up the menu 'Scan QR', 'My Address', 'Share'.
I wouldn't recommend using Coinbase as a wallet though. Actually, neither would Coinbase. Coinbase's support has actually told me (via their chat) to use another wallet for spending/sending bitcoins instead of directly using them.
Try out a real bitcoin wallet. Like Airbitz or Mycelium. I'd recommend Airbitz though, it's easier to use than Coinbase and it's a real bitcoin wallet meaning only you have control over your money. Unlike Coinbase, no personal info is required.
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:23:55

Gold is much much less volatile than bitcoin.
Still more volatile when compared to things like the USD, but it's way less volatile than bitcoin.
To see just how volatile something is, you can't look at just the price change quoted in USD. You need to look at the price change %.
According to  gold's price changed -0.29%. This is orders of magnitude less volatile than bitcoin.
According to  bitcoin's volatility (at the time of this writing) is 4.69%.
We're already seeing a gradual decline in volatility in bitcoin as  bitcoin becomes more widely used.
The basic concept is that the larger the market cap, the more net value you need to move in/out in order to move the price at. As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, it's market cap should grow, making it more difficult for the price to move suddenly, making it more stable.

Using a hosted wallet means you give up lots of the benefits of bitcoins. You basically make Coinbase a Bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:02:48
There's more benefit to bitcoin than just that for consumers.
Security - You're not losing any amount of security by sending bitcoins to a merchant, whereas with a credit card, you need to trust the merchant to keep your details safe and to not abuse them themselves.
Privacy - It isn't a requirement to give up personal information about yourself in order to buy something in bitcoin.
Accessibility - Many people can't have bank accounts or credit cards. This includes most minors (under 18), women (in some countries), most outlaws, and those unbanked for several other reasons.
Now you may not care too much about these benefits, since you may not care about the benefits. For many, many consumers though, bitcoin has many benefits besides a potential discount.
Also, you don't have to give up the ability to have consumer protections with bitcoin either. You can use arbitration or escrow to protect yourself from problems with the merchant in the same way that chargebacks do as well. It's just not required in bitcoin. You have choices, you have financial freedom.

Cool that it was mentioned. Most people still think of bitcoin as a cool nerdy tech though, not actual money they'll be using anytime soon.
If you haven't already, check out airbitz.co and familiarize yourself with businesses in your area that accept bitcoin so that you can reference them. It helps ligitamize it in people's eyes. Perhaps the fact that Gyft also lets you spend it at many massive retailers like Target, Macys, AMC Theaters, etc. (and gives you 3% off) would be useful.

A small but important distinction. 
I like to look like things like transaction volume averages, bitcoin days destroyed ( where the bottom of the sum of days destroys touches ).
Looking at stats it looks like use of bitcoin is up and averaging the highest it's ever been. Hard to tell what for, but people are using bitcoin daily more and more. Real use. People with a lot of money can move the market easily right now though. Also, I think miners are having a huge part in the decreasing price.

We can't make scammers stop scamming or theifs stop robbing. What we **can** do is improve our security standards in the community. Bitcoin isn't bad security. Many of the 'security' problems that result in stolen/frozen/lost coins are problems of centralization, or bad software that doesn't protect private keys.
Scamming is a whole different issue, but the solution is similar.
We need to focus on what we actually **can do** to solve the issues that the bitcoin community faces. 
We need to have proper security practices be commonplace in the bitcoin community. Multisig, cold storage, Holding your own private keys, etc.
What we need is *easy* to use solutions like Trezor, Airbitz, etc. in order for the best practices to be usable by everyone. Making the best security practices in bitcoin human friendly.

Even without bitcoin, credit card fraud is going to get more difficult with improved security standards (albeit they're slow to market) like the chips in plastic cards being implemented in the U.S. and phones using NFC become more commonplace.

That's still not seizing it. You can refuse to give the bitcoins up even under the threat of criminal prosecution.
You would still end up with the bitcoins and they wouldn't be able to take them. Maybe you would say that you'd pay them so they'd leave you alone, i.e. send them the bits in exchange for your freedom, but you would have that decision and that control. Nothing else can do this. Not cash, gold, banks. Only bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as far as I know.
Short of torture, there's not much anyone can do to steal your bits if you properly secure them.
That's also assuming that they're absolutely sure that you have the bits. If they aren't sure, it's not very realistic to prosecute you criminally for money you may or may not have. Plausible deniability.

Eh... For spending money, use a wallet that's always going to work. Security isn't a big focus, but you still need your money to be sent out.
I know people that liked to use Coinbase for spending and one day a transaction they made got stuck and because bitcoin invoices from Bitapy expire in about 15 minutes, the invoice got cancelled before the bitcoins were ever sent. 
They have to reach out directly to BitPay to recover the funds.
This would be a bigger nightmare at a brick-and-mortar. Having to wait up to 48 hours IN STORE for your money to be sent? Hell no. Don't use Coinbase as a 'spending wallet'. 
Maybe their multisig one could work though. Then you could control when to broadcast the transactions. Although I think that's overly complex.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:56:48
Depends on what level of security you want.
If you want a good simple way to store your coins in cold storage, something like bitaddress.org works well.
It's a open sourced page.
So you would have to go to the website, save the page as a file. Right click, save as.
Then go to a computer that has never and will never see the internet. Lots of people use a live CD or USB of an operating system like Ubuntu.
Then open that file you saved, generate the key by following the instructions in the website and save that key to a USB flash drive. That private key there will be the key to your funds, so make sure not to lose it and make multiple backups. 
Something like this is the best security practices in the Bitcoin space. No one's ever reported losing coins with true cold storage.
Depending on what % 1 BTC is for you though, I'd just move it to a wallet that gives you complete control over your keys. There's many 'real' wallets that give you control over your keys. Airbitz, Mycelium, Breadwallet. Etc. If this isn't your life savings, I'd say a good hot wallet like Airbitz will be fine.
The problem with Coinbase and circle is that their hosted wallets. Essentially, they control your money when you have money in them. They're just a Bitcoin bank. Money you have in wallets like Airbitz on the other hand, is like cash you have in your hand. Only you have control over it. Cold storage is like a safe.

Bitcoin is available for transfers 24/7.
Circle is a business, a new one that's still setting things in as well. They're team is also much smaller than that of a full bank too.
ACH's, even VISA or MasterCard transactions aren't really instant.
ACH's only run business days which isn't even weekdays. Cost about 15 cents which is about 5 times as much as a bitcoin transaction costs.
VISA transactions are instantly charged, but not instantly deposited or available to the person receiving the funds. Those still have to go through an ACH transfer.
Bitcoin does have the potential to make some businesses or at least some big portions of businesses unnecessary.

Google Maps and Bing/Apple Maps probably list the same businesses too.
Bitcoin merchant adoption being in the stage its in will probably look similar across several merchant directories.
The inaccuracy of the example you posted looks like it was fixed 3 days after you pointed it out.
If you know of any businesses no longer taking bitcoin, sending Airbitz an update will fix the error pretty quickly.
Overall, I think Airbitz is more accurate. As time progresses, I think the difference will become more apparent.

The Airbitz wallet does this for you in a transactions 'Transaction Details'.
The USD amount under the mBTC amount is recorded at the time of the transaction. You can also overwrite it with any number you want if the exchange rate doesn't match the exchange rate you used for that transaction. I.e you sell 100$ worth of bitcoin for 120$.
This along with optional categories, notes, and tagging combined with search makes Airbitz a powerful tool for keeping track of all your bitcoin related things. Everything is backed up and encrypted too, so privacy isn't an issue. It's completely open sourced as well.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:03:38

It's not that Bitcoin isn't 'enough', it's that people have different ideas on how it should work. We see this is many different open source projects too. Linux distros have a lot of different options. This makes it a very competitive environment.
Digital currency is pretty unified already though. Look again at coinmarketcap.com. At the top center, (at the time of this writing) the total market cap of everything listed is 4,901,162,875 while Bitcoin's market cap is 3,899,636,730. 
Bitcoin's market cap is the size of roughly 75% of the entire market cap of all cryptocoins combined. Bitcoin is where the majority of the resources (money, development, support) is in.

USD balance will always be an estimate. Check the amount of bits. There shouldn't be any discrepancy with that.
You can then see the USD estimate value by multiplying the price on an exchange * the amount of bitcoin in your wallet.
Fiat value estimates can't be the same everywhere.
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:14:12
So Coinbase is not really a bitcoin wallet. In any real way.
It's a hosted wallet. Coinbase has their wallet and they act similarly to a bank does with USD by giving you 'credits' in your account when you buy/sell or deposit/withdraw bitcoin there.
I'd recommend using a real wallet where only you own your private key.
A good wallet that is still easy to use that gives you complete control over your money is [Airbitz](
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:02:38
Well essentially you're transferring your funds to a real wallet from a hosted wallet.
Just moving coins from account to account.
If you want something to play around with for free, I'd recommend trying out a testnet wallet.
It's the same exact thing as bitcoin, just with worthless coins (since they're occasionally reset and controlled).
You're doing the exact same thing as a bitcoin transaction but using a side-network basically.
This is great for testing things out 'in theory' before trying them on the real bitcoin blockchain where transactions cost real money and mistakes have real financial consequences.
Grab a testnet wallet, like [mycelium's testnet]( and get some free coins from a [testnet faucet](
With testnet coins, you can move coins around all day long.

This potentially would be problematic. Mining rewards require a "proof of work". The proof protects the network from being cheated. 
It isn't too hard to imagine how you could fake core nodes on the network and spam the network with these fake nodes to gather all the fees.
Also, .02%? Deciding on the % number would be controversial. The miners wouldn't like this proposal, etc. 
Overall, lots of problems with trying something like this.
I agree nodes should get some financial incentive though to keep being nodes. I'm just not sure that's the best way to give it to them.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:25:01
Really wallet software should be simple and straightforward enough so that this isn't a problem.
Most wallets throw addresses on the screen. I think this is a less graceful option. Mycelium on Android is a prime example of this.
Addresses are ugly, scary things to people unfamiliar/new to bitcoin.
I still think it's important to own your own private keys though. 
That's where wallets like Blockchain.info and Airbitz.co come in. Although Blockchain.info's security is questionable and has failed at protecting user's funds recently.

It is completely 100% free to take bitcoin. It's the same cost as accepting cash. 0. This is why many retaliers offer bitcoin-specific discounts in the same way gas stations offer a better price for customers paying in cash over credit/debit. Now to protect yourself from volatility (price moving up and down), you'll need to use a payment processor. 
Check out BitPay's [overview video](
Most customers probably haven't heard or used it yet, but in terms of current bitcoin users, yes, but it actually doesn't matter in terms of security. Trust is not necessary to prevent fraud from a transnational point of view.
The important difference between credit cards and bitcoin that you should understand here is that credit cards are a *pull system* i.e. the merchant pulls x specified amount of money off of the card/account.
Bitcoin is a *push system* i.e. consumers essentially create and broadcast x specified amount of money, and merchants wait till they've received it.
The key security difference here is that when you have a credit card's information, you potentially have the ability to charge the entire credit line (often 1,000's of $) for every single transaction from a coffee to a house. The person giving you the credit card information **has to trust you to only take what they're agreeing for you to take**. 
With bitcoin, no trust is required. You give them an address, they send the amount you request there and transaction is done. This is one reason why bitcoin is called a trust-less system.

A quick follow-up.
There was some news about PayPal and Stripe actually integrating bitcoin into their services (with the normal fees) so that adding bitcoin as an option can be as easy as clicking a button.
For PayPal, they published [this video]( a while back and have a page with bitcoin-integration instructions here: 
Stripe is currently testing out bitcoin support here: 
So depends on which choice you want to take :). Bitcoin is an open and transparent platform so you'll have many many choices to pick from. BitPay offers 0% fees but if you're already using PayPal or Stripe, you may want to look into their solutions since it could make your life easier.
Unrelated, but if you're looking to complete the circle, perhaps consider something like [BitWage]( which allows employees to get paid a portion or their whole salary in bitcoin. I don't have any experience with them yet but I already get my salary 100% in bitcoin through my employer directly.

I see a lot of potential problems here...
Ever change to the Bitcoin network requires lots of testing as there are lots of points of possible failures.
Your proposal changes the difficulty, the reward and does some scaling up/down.
I don't see much of a benefit over just increasing block size.
If block size is universally increased, I can't imagine that


Also, I don't really think that code readability is actually as crucial as you'd imagine.
Most people implementing services for bitcoin are probably not using core Bitcoin code to do so. They're probably using some API/tool at this stage. In early development, say bitcoin days when the price was 0.05 - 10$ I'd say that might be more crucial.
I would say that dealing with growing transaction volume is something that the community should start working to solve.


**Only 70%??**
70% of our capacity is being used? Don't know if you mean max block size or average.
Transaction volume is capped now at about 7 tps. We currently have a little more than 1 tps average in a day which is about 14%.
Whichever it is, if bitcoin is going to succeed and gain traction, it's easily conceivable that bitcoin will need higher limits somewhat soon. Changes to the network, especially ones like these need to have time to be ironed out properly.
Also, with more transaction volume, we can have more transactions and thus start moving towards higher overall miner fees, which will have to start replacing rewards as we approach another halving of rewards.

Lighthouse also has some other things to it that makes it more useful than a simple donation page.
Right now though, it's essentially just like currently implemented crowd-funding sites. Just cutting out the 10% fee most take.

Yeah you'll need an exchange like Circle, Coinbase, etc. to buy / sell bitcoins for now but for sending or receiving bitcoins, it's best to use a 'real' wallet.
I enjoy some of the advanced features in Mycelium too, but for the average person, they need a easy to use wallet like Coinbase but shouldn't have to give up their privacy or control over their bitcoins. 
Which is why Airbitz is great for most people. It's friendly and familiar like Coinbase but doesn't take away any of the advantages of bitcoin. Privacy, Autonomy, and Decentralization.
Just make sure to backup your private keys when you use Mycelium. Lose your keys, lose your money. That manual step isn't required in either Coinbase or Airbitz.
Take Care! :)

No. I've requested that in their slack. It makes sense to not include it if you're using the wallet for spending bits on purchases as most users will want fast confirmations and the difference between $0.01 and $0.08 is worth it in that case.


Yes, but within the wallet themselves, the option for custom fees aren't available. Copay has a global setting called "bitcoin network fee policy" with the options: "Economy, Normal, and Priority" which help a lot if you're sending tons of transactions all the time that don't require fast confirmations.

One key difference is the finality of the transaction.
TL;DR - It potentially is secure enough for the majority of use cases, but it isn't as secure and probably can't be.
If doing a high value transaction with bitcoin, bitcoin confirmations are often desired and required.
This is because a bitcoin transaction is not finalized, we only get security of finalization because of the blockchain and the way blocks and transactions are dependent on each other in a forward way making it difficult to 'rollback the blockchain'.
Lightning network is cleaver in that it may increase throughput, lower costs, and give a decent degree of irreversibility; however I don't believe it can ever match the degree of certainty of finality that a bitcoin transaction which has 3-100+ confirmations can.

If Nu has a blockchain that secures the total value of Nu in a publicly verifiable way which isn't controlled by a central authority, then there is no "me" to trust.
The risk isn't that a "me" will be incompetent, dishonest, etc. but that the value will get out of sync too much too fast to be able to back the NuBits.
Coinapult/Uphold/Banks don't have this risk since they (allegedly) hold the actual asset that the token represents.

For people like us, who care about bitcoin or are techy it's not that bad.
There's been plenty of posts on this subreddit of people getting burned out and/or disheartened as a result of asking.
Most people, (likely 95%+) don't care or think about the underlying tech.
They just want high quality (seamless), low prices in the tools/products they use in everyday life. If you don't give them that, they will stop using it.
We need to understand the demographic we're working with in order to understand which solution is probably best for them.
I agree that we the bitcoin community should, but I don't think it's good to use that as the first and best option available to them.
I think the harm is limited if you list it as a option among others, but if that's the only option shown to them, I think that will have a negative effect and turn them off from bitcoin. At least initially. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:58:56
That can happen at two blocks, three blocks, four, etc. I have watched transactions go from 2 and 3 confirmations to unconfirmed.
Each confirmation exponentially increases security, however you never become 100% secure.
It's a matter or risk management. 1 confirmation does add security though.

Miner's can't confirm blocks faster than an average of 10 minutes for a sustained amount of time as the difficulty for solving blocks controls the speed at which the blocks are solved.
That's why blocks can be solved faster or slower depending on the hashrate of miners but the average is always close to ten minutes because difficulty adjusts to keep the rate within a range.

Yes but for most people, that's not a option and trying to go down that rabbit hole usually ends in frustration (since you usually get nowhere) and the person ends up using something else which is ultimately worse.
It's good to have people buying and selling bits on exchanges at first, as they're already familiar with the process and can easily be matched with people to buy and sell peer to peer for goods and services eventually.
Jumping the gun can be counter-intuitive though.

Adding the option of using a third party and voluntarily within the same app isn't pushing users into the arms of KYC.
Users that have the desire to use those services will do so anyways, it'll just be less convenient for them.
Users that don't have the desire to go through the burden and hassle of KYC won't use the service anyways and will not have their privacy breached in anyway. Users should understand that entering in personal details into any app is bad for their privacy. If you're concerned about that not being clear, you can put a big warning message and have the user type "I understand".
By not adding the feature, it seems you're just reducing revenue for your wallet and excluding useful features for your users.

Perhaps you could have a setting to toggle it on/off, or have two separate versions of the app. Although I don't see what negative possible consequence having options in the same app may have. Enlighten me?

Since the security difference between no confirmations and 1 confirmation is huge (even with something like litecoin that has less POW behind each block), making block time faster on average would still allow this and would allow users to get to a minimal amount of security faster.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:55:59
Yes some wallets won't allow you to spend without a confirmation. Many exchanges/banks will make you wait for 3-6 too.
There isn't any restriction at the protocol level and you can always spend it manually if you own the bitcoin private key.

From the user's perspective, this is the same process as something like Transferwise, which only charges 1.5% (no hidden fees), can be instant, and doesn't use bitcoin.
You don't even let users deposits bitcoin? What's the point of using bitcoin if you can't beat the legacy banking system in speed or price?
Really for small transactions, you can accept bitcoin (under mexican laws) and deposit it into mexican bank with very limited or non-existent KYC, protecting users privacy and making the user-experience better.
It would be better to integrate a third-party bitcoin seller like Coinbase or Kraken Instant on the US side to handle the behind the scense sale of bitcoin (1%-1.5% fee and less if you integrate into the exchange (0.2%~ fee)) then integrate with bitso (less than 0.10% fee for high volume) on the Mexican side and have them make the SPEI transfer to the Mexican bank.
Just with those two integrations, the real cost is less than 0.5% with all the exchange fees. Charge 1% flat fee and take 0.5%. No direct counterparty risk to you if you become just a seamless connection for both exchanges.

The protocol, not the blockchain.
Data in the blockchain is immutable. This is true of bittorent too, but the protocol can be updated without changing the immutability of it. 
In fact, the protocol will probably need to be updated in order to keep it immutable. If a security flaw is discovered or something that may damage the immutability of the network.

People won't trade fiat or goods and services for bitcoin if they don't think that they can get fiat or goods and services back for bitcoin at a later date.

From a cursory inspection, it seems BIP75 is simply making a open standard for KYC/AML. That in it of itself doesn't seem like a bad thing.
I hate KYC/AML as much as the next guy, but it only makes things worse if each business is separated into seperate, non-compatible KYC/AMLs.
If I open 5 different account verification to 5 different exchange services, I have to trust each one individually to keep my personal details safe as they all have a copy of my information and I also have to go through the entire verification with each of them. This adds unnecessary friction that an open standard could solve.
Bitcoin is above the law in terms of bitcoin based transactions never ask for permission but individuals using bitcoin have the option of following laws if they choose to. This seems to be what this is. Individuals and businesses choosing to follow KYC/AML laws. Of course with bitcoin you don't need to in order to make valid transactions.

It says you can't use a bank statement either. This is verification for ACH.
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:11:02


I believe if the user has a verified bank account that has been used multiple times in previous transactions. New ACH accounts need to have a few transactions "clear" or "arrive" first. Even for non-instant, it's about 1-2 business days, and ACH being sped up will probably improve this further. Furthermore, domestic wire transfers are available. Beating out your service in both price (for large enough transactions) and speed. Only losing in terms of convenience since a almost always has to be done manually with the bank; although many banks allow you to make domestic wire transfers easily online.


An easy point of reference is how the largest regulated mexican bitcoin exchange [Bitso]( operates. Bitso allows users to "fund and withdraw: $5,300 pesos per day" and "$32,000 pesos per month" with the only listed requirement being that the user must "Verify your cellphone number".


If properly integrated, it can be done seamlessly where the user doesn't even notice that they're using a third-party. A good example of this is how Glidera was integrated into many bitcoin wallets like Airbitz, Coapy, etc. In the case of Airbitz, users could sign up, verify, and buy bitcoins without ever leaving the app.


I was simply quoting the fee for trading on Bitso for high volume traders. This is the actual cost right now that Bitso would charge me if I go and sell bitcoins on the Mexican bitcoin exchange and withdraw it to my Mexican bank account.
Of course for a business there are other fees, but my point is it seems there's a lot of space for wiggle room here.
Right now, if I want to send money using fiat from both sides for a large volume transfer. I can send a domestic wire transfer from my online banking access to a US based exchange like Kraken, buy bits from Kraken, send the bits to a Mexican bitcoin exchange like Bitso, sell the bits and transfer it to my Mexican bank account.
The fees in that scenario would be:
* Domestic wire transfer ($25~)
* Kraken trading fee (0.2%~)
* Bitso trading fee (0.1%~)
On a 20K transfer, the real fee would be about 0.5%~ total. Domestic wire transfers can be available same day too so the funds could be transferred same day.
For ACH and instant, just replace Domestic wire transfer fee with a service like Coinbase or Gemini. 
In the case of Gemini, the only fee I'm aware of that would be assessed is their [normal trading fee]( (I think max 0.25%).


Like I believe you previously mentioned, other countries you're working on supporting will probably have more volume. I think something similar to this may have promise though. I think Abra is trying to be something like this in a way. Although they're definitely moving slow.

@_date: 2016-11-03 07:49:27
The whole point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust any individual or small group of people. That's what a bank is.
It is definitely not profitable for any miner, pool, or other same entity to have 50%+ of the hashing rate. That's why pools in the past have blocked further miners from joining in the past to avoid this. It's not profitable as the confidence in bitcoin would go down and the price would go down with it.

That's not a fair comparison. Having options to use KYC services doesn't make you use them. Any user that wants to maintain privacy isn't going to enter private details into any app.


As long as privacy is the default, i.e. no KYC popups, or prompts when setting up the wallet, then I don't see this as becoming an issue. This is only an issue when privacy is not the default. If you make KYC opt-in, instead of opt-out, KYC becomes the sore thumb sticking out; not privacy.
In another comment the wallet developers said they don't see any usefulness in KYC apps. I can understand that as a perfectly good reason not to include them.
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:38:36
Bitcoin can and will remain fungible no matter how good KYC is as coin mixing is a thing.
90%+ of all cash in circulation has trace amounts of drugs within them detectable by drug sniffing dogs when placed together.
The main thing to protect fungibility is to make all bitcoins "dirty" by mixing them. Then, like with cash, services will be forced to accept dirty/blacklisted bits again.
Bitcoin will force the KYC world, not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:33:04
It's more like running a bitcoin node vs a bitcoin wallet that verifies the blockchain for you.
Most people can't realistically run a bitcoin node. The mainstream option is to have lightweight things. There are some good middle grounds. I think there's a JS based node.

Amounts will vary by person.
If you're from a poor country, and those 10 btc are your savings for the last 10 years. I would recommend a more secure storage.
If 10 BTC is less than 1% of all your wealth, then sure it's probably no big deal to have it on a hot wallet. The added risk is worth the convenience in that scenario.
Increasing the amount doesn't decrease security (unless someone knows to target you).

Yes. Mining is a sell-adjusting thing.
You can follow this logic:
    While mining_cost &gt; mining_revenue:
       highest_cost_miners.stop_mining()
       difficulty--
       mining_revenue++
Eventually it becomes profitable again, but at no time will there ever be no miners at all so long as there are buyers for bitcoin.
The only problem that a very big and sudden price movement or mass miner deactivation can have is short term. The difficulty doesn't adjust that quickly, and in the meantime, blocks will take very long to be solved, so transactions can consistently take a lot longer to get even one confirmation.

Bitcoin is the most profitable coin to mine with the same algorithm. Other alts like Ethereum aren't compatible with the same hardware.
@_date: 2016-11-10 20:32:54


I believe at a minimum they can see that you have a bitcoin wallet installed. That alone could *potentially* make you a target, which could then lead to further attacks on privacy.
Although that's a bit of a slippery slope. Just worse case.
Ultimately software can be flawed, and often is. Information can leak even through many sandboxed environments. iOS isn't open sourced? So you can trust the software and hardware manufactures or you can use open sourced code with firmware you can flash yourself.
This level of paranoia or security might not be necessary for what most users are going to do, but I'm not going to say it's secure and private if there's a lot of potential problems.
So I suppose we can recommend use if privacy and security aren't absolutely critical. i.e. Your activity won't get you in trouble you need to avoid, and the complete loss of funds won't be devastating to you.

For the same reasons you wouldn't install a third party code on a hardware wallet for instance. Software sandboxing has often had loopholes before.
I said even if the private key isn't compromised, i.e. even if the ownership of money isn't compromised because of privacy though. It sounds like your bitcoin activity may be able to be monitored, which damages the fungibility aspect of bitcoin.
In general bitcoins on most smartphones is a very un-optimal solution in terms of security, privacy, etc. It has the advantage of being very convenient though. I can see the use case for small amounts of money where privacy isn't absolutely critical. I still wouldn't recommend it though.

In reality, nothing is perfect, just more or less safe.


The likelihood of *everyone* being against you is much less likely than one centralized authority being against you.
Decentralizing trust is much more reliable than trusting a centralized authority in general.
Of course you can't be sure unless you check the code yourself.
Even if you check the code yourself though, there is likely bugs and/or vulnerabilities that haven't been uncovered yet.
So nothing is perfect.
That being said, hardware wallets that have very few possible code execution path options are probably safer as there's less room for error.

========== DO NOT MODIFY ==========
and then I would send you the password via direct message for you to be able to spend the bitcoins.
The upside is that this is decentralized. You don't have to trust anyone but reddit or social media you're using (since they have the encrypted key and the password in private message). Moneypacket is open sourced.

That's the cost per transaction. If you make about 10 transactions per day, that's $0.90 per day. Still relatively cheap, but I'd hardly call this competitive with banks.
Being your own bank and cheap transaction fees aren't exclusive, we can and should have both in one system. Bitcoin can do that, even if we can't do it on chain right now. LN and other systems will allow us to have cheap transactions we desire, while still letting us be our own bank.
Transactions are expensive though, we need to work towards making them cheaper.

Paper doesn't last forever. Depending on the type of paper, you shouldn't rely on it for more than 20+ years unless it's un-ordinary paper that's correctly stored.
Unless you do the wallet generation offline though, this is hot storage we're talking about. Cold storage shouldn't be kept in one thing on one storage mechanism.
Paper and digital (encrypted) copies in multiple secure locations are probably the way to go.
This isn't about cold storage though. These are hot wallets though. Recommending 13 words to backup for a hot wallet is crazy.
Also, bitcoin itself will be severely damaged in a real EMP. To my understanding though, this is all theoretical, and no major EMP's have actually been used yet, similar to the threat of Quantum computing.

To be clear: The backup is just backing up the  private seed of the wallet right?
Centralized bitcoin banks like Coinbase and Circle give up privacy and control for ease of security.
Now this is a bad option too, and the hassle of dealing with your own backups is probably worth it, but it is a hassle.
Airbitz encrypts the private seed locally and then automatically backs up the encrypted seed. This is basically what LastPass does for passwords, but with Bitcoin.

* No, it's the same related issue. If the Block size limit was something like 200 MB, the attack we just saw would probably be impossible for most small to medium players. It would take a much larger amount of money to cause a backlog.
It IS actually pretty far into the future until we start relying on transaction fees instead of block rewards. Right now, transaction fees aren't even on the radar of miners at all. They're pennies to them. The block reward is much more 75%, probably more than 95% of the total amount of btc they get for their work. It'll probably be 2 - 4 more block reward halvings to get to being "dependant" on transaction fees. 2016 Is the next one if I remember correctly. Then 4 more years. That's a good while.
I'm actually in favor of removing the hard limit on block size entirely, and allowing miners to decide for themselves what block size to mine. This will make Chinese miners mine empty ( or small ) blocks but may make other miners mine bigger blocks. Transaction fees and block size shouldn't be hard coded. They should be based on the market forces within the system itself.

No of course not, in the long term we should remove the hard-limit entirely. But I don't think there's realistically any really big players that will try to disrupt bitcoin in the same way some smaller players are right now.
Right now, we should do one hard fork to stop Bitcoin from imploding by making fees up go like crazy when there's no real reason besides the block size limit for them to go up. We should try to keep fees low while bitcoin is growing at it's crucial steps.

If it's in the blockchain and the address is correct (meaning you also have the private key) then you don't need Mycelium to recognize the transaction.
You can pull out your private key from Mycelium, load it into any other wallet, and send out your funds.
Bitpay's open source bitcore library has a neat playground tool that has been quite useful to me in the past.
You can get your private key out of Mycelium's HD seed there and then create the transaction at:

Well, a miner doesn't have to include a transaction. There's soft-limits that miners can do. Miners have the discretion of not including transactions. It's just progressively more and more expensive for them to do so and thus they're incentived to add transactions into their blocks - but not all the transactions.

Even though the cash is "tainted"; the fact that enough cash has been tainted makes the fact that it is tainted irrelevant and accepted again.
If we all mix our coins so that even a large minority has touched "dubious" sources then companies complying with KYC and AML will have no choice but to either stop accepting bits or start accepting all bits, regardless of their taint.

Technically it's possible to send bitcoin for free. Transactions are instant, confirmations aren't.
Bitcoin can be sent for free and instantly arrive to the recipient.

Consumers are dumb yes, but they do react to discounts.
Also I've had a much bigger hassle with credit cards than with bitcoin. That "insurance" also means your credit card can and most likely will be frozen for seemingly no reason. Bitcoins I hold are never frozen.
There isn't really much to learn in order to properly use bitcoin. Many bitcoin advocates try to explain how bitcoin works. Consumers don't care. Explaining the technical aspects of nearly anything will bore and confuse your average joe. Using it is very simple and easy with today's wallets though. There's even bitcoin bank accounts that sync with your bank.
Indeed it will take time and UX improvements and even then there won't be a big enough reason to switch. Bitcoin will only become adopted by non-consumer facing issues.

Unless all the loans on BTCJam end in default, proper diversification will guarantee that you'll get money back from those who pay back their loans.
Not all loans end in default, even on BTCJam. What's important is the default rate. BTCJam's is definitively hard, and they are working on getting that under control.
With proper diversification, you do get a positive ROI, not a negative one. Now you don't get the 20% advertised, but I find that the problem with getting a negative ROI is often the investors fault, not the platforms'.

You could say the US dollar doesn't offer currency itself either, but I don't think that's helpful.

If the transaction's mined, there might not be much you can do.
Maybe if it's a well known miner, you can ask them for the incorrect mining fee back. 85 BTC is not a small mistake. Miners have a interest in having the coins they mine be worth something and thus are incentivized to try to keep the price up, at least in the short term.

You can't modify a transaction at all, you must create a brand new one.
So you'll need to make the transaction again with a different mining fee, sign it, and broadcast it.
The difficult part of this most of the time is that wallets don't normally allow you to double spend since that can cause problems with normal behavior.
So with most wallets, you'll either have to wait a long time (usually days or even weeks) for the transaction to be kicked out of the memepool completely or manually create the transactions outside of your wallet, sign it with the private key from the wallet and manually broadcast it.
The easiest way to manually create transactions is using some open source advanced bitcoin toolkits.

Real wallets don't require identification. Hosted 'wallets' do.
There are web wallets like blockchain.info (I don't recommend them at all) that don't require identification or personal information to use.
Hosted wallets like Coinbase or Circle aren't normal bitcoin wallets, they function much more like a bank account. They hold your bitcoins for you and you trust them.
With a real bitcoin wallet, you control your bitcoins and only trust that the software you are running was written correctly and doesn't have a bug in it. This is why many bitcoin wallets are open sourced so you can check the code yourself and you don't have to trust in the creators of the wallet in order to securely use it to store or send your bitcoins.

Miners will whatever will make them the most amount of money. In this case, miners think that broadcasting an empty block will make them more money than waiting to including transactions and potentially lose out on the entire block reward.
This strategy is correct, it yields the most amount of money. It's not a choice between making bitcoin work better or not either. If they don't broadcast the empty block as fast as possible, another miner can and will, and thus keeping the blockchain with empty blocks. So the only reasonable thing to do is to broadcast a block with whatever transactions you have ready, as soon as you solve it.

The price of rent is usually more complicated than that. 
I.e. The price of rent going up in one place correlates with the price of rent going down in another, etc.
If your rent is too expensive, that may mean the area is too desirable and/or your income isn't high enough. 
Possible solutions include:
* Getting a roommate to split your rent.
* Moving to a cheaper place.
* Increasing your income.
* Cutting other expenses in order to afford the rent.
There's more than that, but blaming Airbnb for increasing rent prices is a narrow way of looking at it.

It's useless to try to stop this blackmailing simply by not selling bits. Instead, try talking to the victim and convincing them they're being scammed and of the reasons why they shouldn't send the money.

Do you have any plans to add bitcoin as a payment option? It's short of like credit cards, but with 0% processing fees and 0% chance of fraud (since all transactions are irreversible by design).
It's also more accessible. Everyone can use bitcoin without restrictions whereas there's more restrictions on traditional payment methods. 
Additionally, unlike PayPal or Banks, no one can shut your account down or freeze your assets since bitcoin isn't controlled by any one entity. It's more of a utility type service.
It would be very easy to add bitcoin as a payment option. You could use a good payment processor like BitPay or Coinbase.

Try re-broadcasting the transaction with a higher fee. I.e. double-spending the transaction. The one with the higher fee will probably get confirmed quicker.
Most wallets probably won't let you do this as this is surgery level work and most normal people don't need or want to mess with this stuff. So you'll have to use different software in order to make and broadcast the transaction.
Be very careful where you place your private key, it's the key to your money. Bugs in software or malicious users can steal or lose your bits.
Bitpay's open source node [Bitcore]( has [a online playground]( that can easily let you build, sign and broadcast a transaction.
I haven't used it for a significant amount of money before, but it's worked fine for small amounts.
The steps to create and broadcast the transaction would be something like:
* You'll need the bitcoin transaction input. I.e. the address that holds the money you want to spend. Ex: 1LcyrJfz73uwiAKiWo8kdaStXmZc6KwwEU.
* Select the bits you want to spend.
* **Add the address you want your bits to go to in the output field by clicking "Add Address".** By default, bits not sent somewhere becomes the mining fee. This could result in sending the entire amount as a mining fee which has happened more than once.
* Double check everything.
* Click "Sign all inputs" and sign the transaction by pasting your private key.
* Click "Broadcast Transaction" to send the transaction to the bitcoin network.
The process should be similar for most other tools for building transactions. Note that you by giving your private key to the software you are entrusting your money to the integrity of the software. So don't trust your private key to anything without due diligence.
Electrum also has a powerful command line. [This page]( will show you a few basic principles.
You can follow the documentation on [how to create a transaction]( sign the transaciton, and broadcast it and acomplish the same thing Bitcore could do without having to trust new software since you're already using Electrum.

I'd just install Airbitz. No crazy 12 words to have to keep safe. Just a username and password like usual. Airbitz backs up your encrypted private keys for you so you don't have to worrying about backing up the file. 
Mycelium is a hot wallet just like Airbitz, so you shouldn't store anything your not comfortable loosing. This is analogous to cash in your wallet. For real amounts, look into a cold storage solution like Trezor, Ledger, or you can use a simple paper wallet generated offline.
Mycelium is unnecessarily complex to be a simple day to day spending wallet. I wouldn't recommend it to someone new to Bitcoin. I use mycelium for testing things, and for spending from paper wallets, but not as my main hot wallet.

Fiat is cash, which does not provide accountability. Banks do. We can have Coinbase and other third parties add accountability back into bitcoin the same way banks add accountability to untraceable cash.


You can denominate the price in fiat and use bitcoin to take it, using a simple payment processor like Bitpay to handle the transaction easily. It's not hard or complicated.

Conbase's Tosh isn't the only other node in town.
Arguably [Libbitcoin](  is more developed. It's actually being used by real production wallets like [Airbitz]( and alpha wallets like [DarkWallet]( longer being actively developed). I haven't done a side-by-side comparison between Toshi and Libbitcoin though.
Sounds like an interesting project though. Microtransactions are faster, cheaper, and possible on the real bitcoin blockchain, but they're not quite as good as they could/should be. I regularly make transactions for ƀ1,000 (approx. $0.28 currently) and pay about ~ƀ25 as a transaction fee. That's great and not feasible with normal banks or credit cards, but [Lightning Network]( and similar innovations are going to be needed to allow micro-transactions to really thrive.

I'm using Linux (and Chrome OS). The method to write unicode symbols is different for most major OS's.
For a lowercase bit symbol, the code is 180.

A big part of the reason miners care about the Orphan rate is the block reward.
When there ceases to be a block reward, the importance of the orphan rate will be greatly lessened.
It will still matter, and even with an unlimited blocksize they'll still be fees as a competing miner could propagate a smaller block faster and thus get the miner fees while the bigger block with more mining fees is being propagated.

It's not really possible to use digital fiat money without going through some KYC/AML.

To be clear transaction fees were not used in the early days of bitcoin as they were not necessary.
This isn't an issue of getting the right transaction fee. This is about UX with bitcoin wallets. Electrum is a powerful feature rich bitcoin wallet but it is not very user friendly and can cause these sorts of problems.
Two things that need to happen are:
1) Wallets need better UX
2) The community and users need to pick better wallets.
This isn't unlike the early days of the web and both will come naturally in time.

Also, Gyft and eGifter allows you to spend your Bitcoin at major retailers that don't take Bitcoin yet like Macy's, Target, Etc. You'll get 3% off for using bitcoin since they save on the processing fees.

When done properly, Cold Storage is more secure than Coinbase. Coinbase, with all it's insurance and all it's security measures is less, not more secure than properly executed, secured, and backed up cold storage. Since the security is still based on trust that Coinbase won't run away with the Bitcoins and that the insurance will be able to and comply with their guarantee of funds.

This isn't s problem with Bitcoin. This is a problem with Circle. Use a real wallet that is still easy to use like Airbitz. 
Usually merchants like Gyft will give something like a 3% discount for using bitcoin. This comes from the merchants savings of using bitcoin over credit cards.
Otherwise, it's going to be more expensive since you can't really get Bitcoin at market value with a 0% markup, despite what circle advertises. This problem will disappear in time but for now, without merchant discounts or credit card surcharge, Bitcoin is comparatively more expensive.
At that point, the only benefit is privacy, security, autonomy, and ability to be used.

No. That's called an escrow.

No they don't control it. They arbitrate it. 
So in the case of an escrow. If the escrow agent is malicious, he can run away with the money of the buyer and the seller won't see any of it.
With arbitration, that can never happen. The arbitration can only agree to release the money to either party. Also, a arbitrator can't keep the money locked if the buyer and seller agree. The buyer and seller can complete the transaction without approval of the arbitrator.

I've had several orders canceled, even after my account was manually reviewed twice.
The claims of being scammed by Coinbase are based on the Bitcoin price.
If I buy 100$ of Bitcoin when the price of Bitcoin is 100$, then the price changes to 200$ a Bitcoin, I have lost 100$ of potential gain because of Coinbase's action/decision.
This could conceivable be done by Coinbase to rob people of a lot of money. By selectively canceling orders that have appreciated in value, Coinbase could make a lot of money by taking the gains of people's purchases.
There's no proof that is what they're doing, and I personally don't think they are, but they definitely could be and it would be hard to prove without access to their internal info.
That's a lot of people's suspicion. At the very least, they are taking away many people's potential gains and they're possibly reaping the benefits.

I agree that everyone should control their own private keys, but making the user have to deal with backing up and securing their own keys is a bad idea for the average user. Mycelium is a great tool, I use it for cold storage spending and for a lot of testing. 
For the average person though, easy to use wallets like [Airbitz]( is the way to go. Full control over your private keys and your keys are automatically encrypted and backed up.
People need the easy of use of wallets like Circle, Coinbase, etc. but with the autonomy, privacy, and security of wallets like Mycelium, Armory, Electrum. I find that Airbitz is a perfect middle-ground for the average joe.
Also, Airbitz is a great choice on both iOS and Android.

My problem is that people recommend Coinbase for the average person as a way to store Bitcoin, spend Bitcoin, and use Bitcoin.
I don't think that Coinbase is good for any of those things. I only will recommend Coinbase as a place to buy or sell bitcoins.
Too many if my friends and family members run into issues with services like Coinbase and circle. They have the same problems as banks and PayPal like services. Honestly that makes for a terrible experience.
I understand why Coinbase has to be the way they are. Which is precisely why they're terrible for sending/receiving, storing, or use bitcoin. They're a fancy centralized exchange. I appreciate having another Bitcoin exchange. I cringe when I see people recommending Coinbase as a way to do anything but buy and sell.
Bitcoin isn't that. Bitcoin's magic is that it doesn't have to be the same cluster fuck. You can use a real wallet like Airbitz or Mycelium that won't give you crap about anything.
By having people use Coinbase as their Bitcoin experience, we're making Bitcoin seem like the same thing as PayPal or their bank. Not because it's a "nice" experience either. Because of the rejected purchases, closed accounts, delays in sending Bitcoins, etc. 
Give the average person a Bitcoin wallet and do not take away privacy, autonomy, security or ease of use and they'll be able to see why Bitcoin is magical.

There needs to be categories of charities. Want to donate to world hunger? Or want to donate to that charity that is going to feed a specific Eskimo on M.T. Everest? 
Lot's of charities overlap. It's nice to be able to get specific with what your money will help, but most people will probably benefit from simplicity.

I can buy lots of things instantly, i.e. after sending I have the product and don't have to wait with bitcoin.
It's up to the merchant. Some merchants like Gyft take transactions without a confirmation and some don't. Money is sent and received instantly (and can be re-spent) instantly but settlement isn't. Finalization requires confirmations.

Not sacrifice it, they probably just don't need it if it's a small amount of money. An absolutely catastrophic hack would be more easily replaceable than if they had saved up a long time.
It's not that hot wallets can't have any security, a handful of good ones have very good relative security. It's only necessary to go to the more 'nuclear' security options such as HW and PW when either the hot wallet can't be a) secured well, such as if the only accessible device is known to be compromised, or b) if the amount is worth going through the extra hassle of setting up the secure environment. 
PW and HW have downsides as well, and at small amounts that would be relatively easy to recover, the cons of offline solutions often outweigh the pros.

While that sounds good, if widely used, it's likely to happen multiple times a year.
For comparison there is a [2^128]( chance of an address collision.

You may use the key from an address and once you've spent the money from that address, you'd probably not take the necessary precautions about the key since you've moved the money out of the address.

If governments gave control of the title to a private key holder/owner, then all that could be done.

It wouldn't be a good idea to encourage using text scanning to transmit a bitcoin address.
There are some apps that can read text and you could use those to copy it from one phone to the other.
Bitcoin addresses don't have room for error though. This could easily result in loss of funds as the user could send to the wrong address.

Pretty sure it's technically possible, but I'm not sure copay's UI exposes the functionality needed for that type of setup. You may have to manually play around with their [bitcoin-wallet-service](
The main reason why it may be somewhat not intuitive, is that the public seed has to be "...stored on BWS. This allows BWS to easily check wallet balance, send offline notifications to copayers, etc." and "All copayers need to prove they have the secret by signing their information with this private key when joining the wallet. The secret should be shared using secured channels."
So you will have to 1) create and upload the public seed (Very hard without a computer) and 2) Sign the secret and upload the signed version of the secret.
Technically, this isn't absolutely impossible without a computer, but it's a very painful setup.
They do have a page on "[Airgapped Operation]( but that will have to be an offline computer.
I think Copay supports hardware wallets though, that probably is your best bet.

So looking up the bitcoin address you listed on a different blockexplorer shows me 1 transaction of the amount you mentioned with 44 confirmations. Did you get it through then?

They have been net-positive for a while. According to "


The fact that they're a public sector based organization means the liabilities are the responsibilities of the taxpayers as well as the initial cost from taxpayers still ultimately makes it a taxpayer liability. Although you could distinguish between previous and current taxpayers.
