you underestimate how much bonus is paid to people working in wallstreet and finance and banking. Even bottom rung individuals, aka me.

Yea and? 
Im not following your logic. What does it matter whether a surprise or whether it is known?
25000 employees that are very cognizant in crypto receiving on average 100k lumpsum this jan and feb has nothing to do with whether or not they know how much they are getting.

IF op is telling the truth, which is exactly 96.5883% likely to be false, then OP would've had to buy around 200 BTC back 2015, which would've cost him close to $50k USD (Selling 50 BTC @ $1k to make back his initial investment, and then having 150 BTC left at 20k to = $2.8M USD).
 $50k init inv is 10X more than 99% of people have as "willing to lose" money. 
It is also possible OP bought PRIOR to 2015, but OP made no mention of HODL during the 2013 and 2014 massive losses. 
TLDR: 9 out of 10 likely OP is full of shit. And on the slight chance OP is telling the truth, he would've been a very wealthy investor prior to investing in BTC, using an initial investment of about $50000 USD in order to recoup his initial investment, and reach $2.8M USD on house  money.

BTC true value will be in the million dollar range. 
This is if just 1 percent of off shore bank funds are moved to BTC. 
btc serves off shore bank account holders much better than off shore banks. ANNND it serves them better than any crypto as a daily currency.

OP is 96% full of shit.

"just a multiple" of  40 btc @ 400. Yeah That is 16 thousand dollars....
 "just a little bit of money", and having 3X 16k to invest in BTC... GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. just a multiple my ass.

There's a dozen possible reasons. The one I'd guess is OP took out a loan or invested his entire savings of 20k and bought BTC near the ATH. He's doing every little thing he can to be back in the black, as he's going to sleep sweating on his huge losses the last 10 days.
Getting out on social media and hawking fake Millionaire dreams to everyone is the only thing he can do, and so that's what he does.

on the slight percentage that you were one of those, YOU would've talked about how you suffered huge crashes that didn't recover for months and years, and yet when it reached a new ATH you still had the forsight not to sell, you just kept on holding through 2014 and 2015 and 2016 and then 2017. That is the story you would post. Not this bullshit I just lost a ton of money this month. 
The people that did what you allegedly say you did either wealthy before BTC, or they were people that lost/forgot their BTC and then recovered it years late.

I compare crypt to stocks. You buy a stock it has no real value either.  It's like a baseball trading card. Limited quantity and immutable. 
People buy them to hope they appreciate and they know there's a solid exchange available to buy and sell them as needed. 
Crypto has the easiest most technologically advanced (in many ways) exchange platforms.
