When will this happen?

Is this for sending, receiving? Or converting to fiat?

I see. But the transaction could hang indefinitely right?
For example, if I try to pull out all bitcoin to fiat if I sense it'll crash soon. There's a large possibility it'll just hang the transaction will fail right?
Maybe the network and load itself will stop the large corporations or people from buying and selling mass quantities

I've actually been afraid someone with a ton of money would do this. It's completely possible to do, but isn't that also where the limits come in? You can't realistically invest more than 20k per week (using coinbase anyways) and even then at that price that's like almost 1 bitcoin per transaction per week. So maybe?

So you want fiat and now you're stuck?

Oh damn, you should add 2-factor Auth.
If it logged you out, I wonder if it's because you were logged in somewhere else or if it's because your password changed.

How did you get them taken away?

Serious question to everyone, I am new to bitcoins and definitely see it's potential. I want to get into the scene.
My question is, which one do I buy if I want to slowly invest small purchases over a long period of time?
I bought $3500 bitcoins when it was around $3800.
I then bought $300 of Etherium.
I also realized I have an Acorn account that has another $600 in it.
So that's where my question comes from, if I want to invest $5 a day into a virtual currency, which one? Bitcoin, Lite coin, or Etherium?
Help!!
