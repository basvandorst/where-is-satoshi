Why is the price spiking like this? Can anyone give me a synopsis?
I mean, doesn't bitcoin still have all of the same fundamental problems that prompted the bitcoin cash fork in the first place?
Are we all genuinely ok with paying $5 transaction fees for a digital transaction? I mean... is that really the world we want to be living in?
What am I missing here?

I spent around $2,300 on mining equipment (five different radeon hd 6970 cards and some power supplies). I had the fortune of already owning a couple of high-end computers that had multiple card slots, and I live in an apartment complex that includes utilities (water and electricity) in the rent. At the peak of the market, I was making around $75 a day, but then it crashed. The moment I mined a couple of coins, I would sell them. This meant that I lost out on some of the big peaks, but it effectively spread my risk out across the whole period, and when the market was at rock bottom, I only had a couple of bitcoins to my name.
Either way, my equipment finished paying for itself about 5 months ago, and after retiring one of my rigs, I'm making about $15 a week now in pure profit. I'm still pretty much selling every coin I earn, though. If I ever want to buy something with bitcoins, I buy the bitcoins and make the purchase immediately. Call me crazy, but I still don't trust the volatility of the bitcoin markets enough to hold onto them long-term. That's just me being a cynical bastard, though, and one day I'll probably regret not holding onto all those coins I mined...

The only evidence I have is my own personal observations. I've read a number of forum posts where various early adopters talked about how they were selling off their massive stashes of coins and hitting their Mt. Gox daily limits. If I recall correctly, one guy was making around $30K a month, and was set up to continue doing so for some time.
If you had 200,000 bitcoins (which you had paid only cents on the dollar for, in terms of effort), and the market jumped to $15 a coin, do you honestly mean to tell me that you wouldn't cash in at least part of your stash?
Side note: Here's an unrelated experiment for you:
1. Go to mtgox.com.
1. Click the little orange graph chart icon in the upper-left.
1. Switch the chart to 1 month display mode.
1. Look at how the volume keeps spiking every couple of days with anywhere between 10-35K chunks of bitcoins being sold all at once, almost in a regular pattern.
1. What's going on there?

Many of the early adopters have finished cashing in on their massive wallets which they earned while mining difficulties were much lower and people were valuing the coins at much less than a dollar. Now that those lucky few are effectively out of the market, we are left with people who actually paid real money for their bitcoins, which means they value them more than the original miners did. The end result is a much more stable market, and people are finally able to send bitcoins back and forth between other people who have the same ratio of risk/reward.

fairestcheetah, I was able to reclaim both of my two Mt.Gox accounts. I'm willing to bet that yours will eventually be given back to you, as well, if you are patient.

Ok, so, to rephrase: you will do work... for... money.

No way of knowing, really. I didn't really keep track. The difficulty kept skyrocketing every time I turned around.
For what it's worth, to date, I've mined a bit over 104 bitcoins, all total.

You *do* realize that it would most likely take way more than $5,000 worth of work from a team of programmers for any major company to actually integrate bitcoin into their current shopping cart systems, right?
@_date: 2011-06-27 06:49:07
As I write this, my bitcoin client says it knows about 133477 blocks. If you don't see at least that high of a number in the lower-right corner of your bitcoin client window, then there's a good chance that your bitcoin client hasn't finished downloading the entire block chain.
@_date: 2011-06-29 17:34:55
I'm willing to bet that I can get money into an exchange and convert it to bitcoin in less time than it takes the programmer to actually do the work that is requested of him.

You can buy reddit gold with BTC, very easily! Simply find someone who is willing to gift you reddit gold in exchange for bitcoins!
I'm willing to perform this service for anyone who is interested.
I will be basing my BTC &gt; reddit gold price on the current Mt.Gox exchange rates, which at the moment are about $5.95 per BTC, plus fees.
For example, one month of reddit gold costs $3.99, which comes out to roughly 0.67 bitcoins.
All I ask is that you add in a tip (maybe 0.2 to 0.5 BTC) to help cover the various exchange fees and what not).
Here a bitcoin receiving address that I set up for this purpose:
If anyone is genuinely interested, please send me a message here on reddit with your desired reddit gold membership, and I will respond with an up-to-the-minute price in terms of BTC.
After receiving payment with BTC, I will purchase Reddit gold (using my trusty credit card) and gift it to whichever username you desire.

Tradehill might be more secure, but their web-based interface SUCKS. Seriously.

Just withdrew $54.44 from mtgox over to my dwolla account. Yay.

I live in an apartment complex which includes unlimited free utilities, so there were no electric costs.

Two things:
1. [Guiminer](
2. [MSI Afterburner](
Guiminer makes it really easy to start mining, and it gets better mhash/s than even many of my command-line mining tools for some reason. Make sure you add the extra flags "-v -w128 -f30".
Use MSI Afterburner to set up your fan curves and overclock/underclock the card. Overclock the core. Underclock the memory. If you underclock the memory, your card will run cooler, but it has a negligible effect on mining calculations (which are almost entirely handled by the core). When mining, I try to keep my cards running under 85 degrees celsius, and my fans usually run around 70% (which is just under the tolerable noise threshold for me. I actually take the side off of my case when I'm mining, because this keeps the cards about 5-10 degrees cooler while still keeping the fan noise low.
MSI Afterburner also has profiles which makes it easy to switch between mining mode and gaming mode (you don't want your memory underclocked when gaming, for example).
Note: This advice is all based on the idea of mining with a Windows machine. As other people have mentioned, you can also do things like boot Linux off a USB stick and mine that way. I don't like dealing with all the hassle for the limited (albeit probably tangible) benefit, though, because I like easily switching my mining on/off. This is my home computer which I use for lots of other things, too.

Here's a little collection of screenshots I put together which demonstrate why Mt. Gox is still loved by its users. Basically, Mt. Gox has a well-designed, easy-to-understand interface, while Tradehill is clunky and oftentimes rather obtuse:

You need to be using an OpenCL miner to use the -w128 flag, not the phoenix miner, if I recall correctly. I get better results with OpenCL than I do with Phoenix.

You would, if you were using something like a JSON API and client-side AJAX calls. There are even databases (such as CouchDB) which have a built in JSON API and you can directly manipulate the data with REST and JAvaScript.
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:09:10
It's definitely done a lot with server-side Node.js (Javascript talking to a JSON API just makes sense), and I've also seen it done with plain old client-side Javascript AJAX calls, but it can be done with lots of other languages, too.
Technically, you could do it with any language that was able to make HTTP requests and parse JSON (which would be just about any major language out there nowadays).

Another thing I don't understand is why a company like Butterfly Labs wouldn't just keep the mining rigs for themselves? It no doubt costs them less than their sale price to manufacture the rigs and if each rig can earn $5,000 a day (paying for itself in only one week of running), why in the world are they selling them???
It's kind of like selling a goose that lays golden eggs, in exchange for only 6 golden eggs. A farmer who had such a goose and sold it for such a price would be a complete moron, yes?

You should move your money to a wallet such as Electrum, which doesn't require you to maintain a local copy of the blockchain

If you're so confident that it is "fairly easy to implement" and can even provide a time estimate, why don't you just do it yourself?
If you can't do it yourself, then you're not qualified to be throwing out time estimates or statements like, "fairly easy to implement". Just saying. Nothing is worse than a client who thinks they know more than the developer.
