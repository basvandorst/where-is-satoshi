Been invested in this company for a long time. Things lookin good :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 14:06:24
and they can be seen from space, I promise. They aren't made up imaginary lines created by violent men with lots of guns and tanks. THey are real goddamnt!
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:26:34
Look, another mindless, statist piece of shit. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:15:21
Is it?
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:55:59
omfg. Are you kidding me? You post this shit to get people to send you bitcoin? Just fucking wow.
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:27:27
Google is your friend. I know, its hard to use... but you'll get it, eventually.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:53:01
Well said....but Leviathan is alive and well. Bitcoin threatens their complete control they have on the human race. Gonna be a nasty ass fight to the bitter end. Fuck the state.

Considering that Canada is like Nazi Germany and will bulldoze/tear down your brand new home if it doesn't follow 'their' code to a T, I would think that the guy designing the houses to Canadian spec could probably be built anywhere in the world. Even on the moon, which needs to follow US code because they were the 1st to plant a flag on it, which makes it US federal land. Don't try to graze your cattle on the moon, men with guns with murder them and you.

I'm sure you are a very boring person to involve in conversation. I'm sure you've said "Muh roads!" before. Go fuck yourself.

I didn't say anything without 'backup info'. Also, don't be tellin' people what to do, statist.

I've got a good bit of money invested, but like I said, I'm in it for the long term. Going to bury a few paper wallets soon.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:55:50
Wait wut?
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:50:51


Agreed, they are all statists who worship their one true God, the state.


That's the point. Statists = collectivists. It's been this way throughout all of time. Collectivism/the state and central banks are and have always been the single most dangerous threat to humanity as a whole. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:47:16


Always with the voting and the guns. If statism is such a good idea, why is it always mandatory?

I was taking into account the price dip over the last week. Crash was too strong to use, I do apologize. I'm in this for the long run, believe that.

Some of the best, most inspiring ideas of our time were made under the influence, in a bars, written on napkins. Netapp for example.... so go fuck yourself.

I am thoroughly enjoying how much this sub has changed over the years. Humanity is slowly, but surely, beginning to see the light. The light which illuminates the fact that a violent group of individuals, who claim to help and protect humanity are in fact, destroying it. 
Stockholm syndrome is a mother fucker, and we are all indoctrinated from such a young age it takes a massive effort by the individual and by those trying to help them to truly 'free your mind'.
No one, and I mean no one is mentally equipped to understand, let alone deal with sociopathy which is what 99% of members of the ruling class are infected with from birth. I know this all too well, as I grew up with a sociopath, and it was a mind fuck. These are the people in power, whom you are 'voting' for in which you think you are making a conscious, rational choice.

Adam is well respected here. You should watch who you call an illiterate moron.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:57:51
Calling Adam, Roger 2.0 is incredibly disrespectful to a man who has dedicated his life to developing tools for bitcoin to scale off chain. You  should watch your tongue.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:47:34


How am I doing that? By complementing Adam Back and demanding respect for the man? You have a fucked up view of 'sowing dissent'.
Even [Samson Mow]( disagrees with all of you.
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:33:20
You sound like a bcash'er.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:59:06
Adam is a brilliant engineer. He would never promote a fraudulent exchange, especially on that is an early investor in Blockstream.
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:43:57
Adam Back has repeatedly told us all that the tether stuff is FUD. I believe him.
Bitfinex is also an investor in Blockstream. They aren't going anywhere.
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:56:27
Adam Back has [stated]( many times that the FUD about tether is just that, FUD.
Are you saying Adam is an illiterate moron?
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:55:48


Well Adam has said multiple times it is all FUD, so that is enough for me.

My account is suspect because I have been out of the country for two years in a shit hole country promoting bitcoin to the dipshits who continue to cling to their failing fiat currency?
