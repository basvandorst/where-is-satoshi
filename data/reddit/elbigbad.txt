Doubt it or you’d have capitalized Economics

Centralized banking doesn’t work? Degree in economics? Lolz. Crypto is no different than using a credit card except harder.

Serious? You think it isn't because it's a science? It's not a science lol. If you want to talk about economics (like this) it's lowercase. If you majored in Economics (like in this use) it's uppercase. One thing that's for damn sure is you didn't pay much attention.

It's only considered a science by those who are not in the science fields. Overall it doesn't meet the requirements to be a science. Firstly, science doesn't have a political basis. Sure they can call it poli-sci but that's just an idiot trying to correlate the two. Social Sciences do not relate to Natural Sciences. It's not a science in how we define it. It's a name only tag that isn't relevant. Many call it Social Studies. 
Do I have a rationale source for this? Are you kidding? It's called English. I'm not here to spoon feed you but yes it's black-and-white. 
My rational is that it's obvious you're confusing economics, a social science, with that of natural science. Economics is mathematics.  You can't break down a coefficient of drag, a molecular mass, a chemical reaction, a change in nature, etc from it. It's called a Social Science (capitalized!) but absolutely zero people who major in it are considered scientist. 
PS the point of bitcoin lost all meaning when they decided to tie it to backed currencies. The main reason people mine or buy it is for trading purposes, not spending. People are not mining or trading bitcoin to buy the loaf of a bread. They're doing it to sell for a backed currency to use the currency to buy the bread. That's it's fault. Also the fact everyone wants a currency that's free of regulation but then cry when a few people can swing the market or quantities are hacked/stolen. I haven't seen any reason crypto is better than a regular currency and I'm up 80% for the year just investing normally. Granted that's abnormal but I've averaged 16% a year for the past 6 years and that's my own side money. Not including funds, 401k's, roth IRA's, etc.   Guess buying January 2019 call options in GE when it was $12.90 a share before it beat the quarterly guidance of .11 a share at .16 a share.  But by all means it's great reading how all the degrees in the economic world keep coming up with excuses as to why a fake currency that you can't really spend is plummeting lol.
