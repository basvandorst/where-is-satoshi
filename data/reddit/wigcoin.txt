I doubt she's in any danger. Karpeles isn't in any danger. Hell, Kramer wasn't even in danger after his serious fuck-up. When it comes to that kind of thing, I think people are thinking "eh, somebody else will do it".
She does need some kind of discipline though. I agree with you there. As much as I feel for her now, she still needs to be stopped from spreading disinformation and ruining other people's lives. If only journalists were required to be licensed...
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:11:32
Ok I see what you are saying, but I seriously doubt she is faking her distress in that video.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:39:28
100% Agree. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:48:57
After seeing her on TV today, I would not be surprised if she completely fabricated parts of it to make a narrative fit. So sad.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:24:43
Extreme stress will break down one's immune system. Not saying that's the case. Just sayin...
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:38:13
I'm so sorry man. My condolences... Do you have BTC elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:14:16
Yeah, that's the consensus now. Russian maybe?
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:26:08
Are you positive?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:59:17
Thanks will check out.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:56:39
Holy shit.
That was definitely a life-changing amount. Fucking Tong and Karpeles. As another Bitcoinica victim, I feel your pain (though not nearly as bad). Is 1998 the amount with or without leverage? I lost 101 the same way, without leverage.  &gt;:(

"Of course this is assuming Leah is telling the truth and not being misleading."  Well there's your major flaw right there. It's painfully obvious that Leah took some "creative license" to make this story happen. I would seriously question the dialogue of the police in her story, the quotes from Dorian's brother and family as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:41:30
He probably never even said that. I bet it was more of Leah's creative paraphrasing.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:25:47
If this is the case, then Dorian just scored ANOTHER point in my book! Satoshi or not, you gotta love this guy!
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:37:26
So in all honesty, what kind of ROI are you getting on each Terraminer right now? Part of me thinks I can make more on Just Dice daily.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:45:28
Hi Ryan. Your twin brother, Zhou, owes me 101 BTC from Bitcoinica. Please let him know.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:42:22
Wow, Satoshi was doge since '08...
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:15:38
Oh man good eye! Poor girl...  :(  Dorian seems at worst, inconvenienced by the whole thing. Leah is the one that is suffering at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:12:52
Everything I've seen with Leah previously made me want to just punch the wall. This is the first time I've seen this interview and you can see her wearing down. She's in for a world of hurt (if she is not already there) and she realizes this. It's getting to the point that it's physically effecting her. Seriously I just want to hold her now.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:50:23
Could you copy/paste with redactions? I just find it odd that out of all the hobbies this guy has, NONE are remotely computer-related.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:51:11
Actually, she doesn't seem like an outright liar, so I bet you're right. Leah heard "a-hole" somewhere in a different context and ran with it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:11:24
I thought that too at first. Now it's sounding russian.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:16:16
Really? After just one phone call? Was it because she had already left the stuff on his doorstep? Was she getting too personal? Or is it because he is just quick to snap? (Sorry for the 20 questions)
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:59:03
NICE. How long have you been mining? I see a BFL big one in the corner and then something home-made in the background.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:10:53
Thank you man. Sucks for everyone in the community.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:09:41
Are you really with the Nakamoto family?? The thought of Dorian calling her an a-hole to her face just brings a smile to mine.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:18:12
Good question. If she were male and on the verge of crying, I would definitely feel for him. Dunno if I would want to hold him, though.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:28:25
It's everybody's fault for keeping their coins at a centralized exchange?? "I hope the world learns a lesson"?!?  FUCK THIS GUY.  Where's that darknet site with the crowdfunded assassinations again??
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:12:50


I'm sure there are 0 at this point.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:11:24
So basically, "we can't do anything, but this is how much we've spent..."
And they may need more $$$.
That's what I got out of it.
What about you guys?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:40:39
Good to hear man.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:44:32
This whole mess could only have been the product of feminine "logic". Bring on the downvotes.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:02:43
Well the whole thing is going to blow over soon. Leah will have egg all over her face and hopefully Dorian will accept the donation Andreas is putting together for his troubles.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:56:56
For the record, people were discussing this before your post too: 
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:19:35
Um, is this "Ryan Zhou", the same guy as "Zhou Tong" from Bitcoinica? Google around and connect the dots. He's not exactly the most honest guy around.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:19:29
You bring up a good point. Unfortunately journalism is about ratings, so in effect, it's basically advertising. I'm sure there were a lot of people in the organization that saw how flimsy this was, but still let it slide. Face it, they're getting traffic and attention regardless.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:21:36
Her scientific method sucks and she definitely needs to go back to school, but have you seen the latest CNN interview? I'm done attacking her now. She fucked up and she's paying for it, HARD. Now I hope that this mess gets resolved in the most humane way possible.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:05:57
I ask because I have some BTC that I could spend on mining but everyone keeps saying that it's too late to profit. Part of me thinks that it's all a ploy by current miners to keep the difficulty low. I came SO close to pulling the trigger on two Neptunes a few months ago, but was worried about the ROI (and the power requirements).
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:52:07
Have you spoke with him lately? I hope the media circus has left his neighborhood by now.
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:14:11
Wasn't there something similar involving dollars vs gold coins (or kruggerrands)?

I created an account just to "second" m4v3r's question...
What is the reasoning/logic for withholding that information?
The only things that come to mind are:
1. The funds are gone  and/or
2. The records are gone
Not trying to sound harsh, but after the past few days, neither would surprise me...
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:32:09
"certain basic verificatory evidence" - What does that entail, so we can get request it from them?
For the record, this was from PKF's last email:
"We have received further information from the limited partners which we are currently assessing and we continue to correspond with MT Gox with a view to having the account information released to us.  At this point, MT Gox continues to withhold the information and account access.  We are hopeful that we will not need to issue legal proceedings as this will simply result in further depletion of investor funds."

Too bad they only have Airsoft guns there...
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:48:02
This is what worries me.
I want my coins back before that happens.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:48:40
Have you Googled some of the emails in that list?  I did a few at random and many of them are scammers from the Phillipines...  IMHO it's bogus.
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:42:55
The Bitcoinica customer accounts were held at Mt Gox. According to the firm handling the class action suit, they are still awaiting cooperation from them (in so many words).
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:15:48
It's 2013's "Zhoutonged"...
