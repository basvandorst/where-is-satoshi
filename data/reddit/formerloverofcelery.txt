Not suggesting you said otherwise, just adding important and relevant info to the discussion since so much focus is always put on Clinton's emails

Just to hop in here real quick - he has been arrested for crimes during a Republican administration (Bush), while a Republican is president *and controls the justice department*. Trump could easily have this dropped, but has chosen not to (possibly for political reasons).

Like the [transcripts](

He showed moxy, for sure, but dude was kind of an idiot.    
  
Done in by (literally) his first marketing post for the silk road, he got catfished by a dirty DEA agent, and ordered the killing of 4-5 imaginary people (and one real person).
