Hi yerofeyev, we've posted about Bitpost on the Bitmessage subreddit. Other than than, we haven't really done much tell people about these projects. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:36:38
It was inspired by NashX but different in that there is no 3rd party or intermediary for the transaction.

1) if this means losing access to the private keys, then the escrow cannot be released. This is why we only suggest using this for typical cash sized transactions. Such a situation will occur so rarely that the benefits will far outweigh the costs and save money over third party escrow.
2) We don't have any mixing features. Though mixing could be well suited for the use of two party escrow.
3 &amp; 4) We'd like to support optional reputation systems at some point. Probably starting with namecoin signatures.
5) How does any arbiter decide when they have no access to the item in transit? One of the party just *sounds* more honest? A shipping receipt does not solve the problem in your example and neither would photos since they could be taken of another item.
5.a) Yes, those systems rely on coercion to resolve the dispute. Our purpose is to remove the need for coercion by keeping economic interests aligned. Persistent bad actors simply go bankrupt.

Hi dexX7, thanks for the link. We could use it but would probably likewise redirect it as we do with bitmarkets.org.

This is why the client only allows a full payment or full refund and no negotiation.

The seller must also put up escrow so a scammer will simply loose money by not sending the good or sending an unsatisfactory good. The white paper explains this in detail and discusses reputation systems:  
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:37:00
No, it's based on two party escrow which keeps incentives aligned for both parties without the need for reputation or trusted third parties. There's a full description and discussion on these issues in the white paper:

Thanks Aaron :)

There are decentralized markets with no fees. Bitmarkets avoids escrow agent fees using two-party escrow where buyer and seller put up mutual security deposits that can only be released when both agree on payment or refund.

I agree that is a concern but the results from the Ultimatum Game experiments suggest that people are willing to take a loss to punish unfair players at least up to the amount of typical cash sized transactions. See:  . And as long as more than half of the potential buyers are such people, unfair actors will go bankrupt from repeated transactions.

Gold ETFs have been approved. How is bitcoin different than gold in any way relevant to an ETF? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:58:15
How is Coinbase "unregulated"? Are the exchanges in China unknown to the Chinese government? There are US gold ETFs. How is bitcoin different than gold wrt an ETF?

I wonder where they got the BTC for refunds...

Don't buy more than you'd be willing to hold through a significant long term price drop.

Your question suggests you think increasing the supply of a currency increases the amount of wealth it maps to. You can easily show this is false by asking why handing everyone on earth a trillion dollar USD note doesn't mean no one would have to work again.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:51:17
Looks like a scam.
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:09:33
No, it's decentralized (no middle men, no fees) and uses 2 party instead of 3 party escrow.
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:14:43
Yup, we're aware of this potential issue. Bitmessage allows node specific POW settings, so we can increase the pow to fight spam as well as allowing auto timeouts on setting up the tx, auto blacklisting on timeouts, and requiring addresses that have a high POW cost to generate (requiring a number of trailing zeros in the address).

Bitmarkets is a similar project but based on 2 party escrow and is currently working on OSX with Linux and Windows port in progress: 
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:04:31
Open Bazaar is still susceptible to 2 of 3 mutlisig scams where the 2 other parties either collaborate or are the same entity. Bitmarkets two party escrow solves this problem: 
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:06:35
We're in the process of porting it to Windows and Linux using GNUstep (so it will have a single code base). 
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:15:48
I've been told OpenBazaar is not actually working yet. Bitmarkets has been working since November of last year. I don't say this to put down OpenBazaar - they are doing a much more ambitious project (which therefore takes longer) by trying to implement a reputation system, a escrow market and their own messaging system. Bitmarkets avoids all of these by using two party escrow and bitmessage, which makes it much simpler and easier to implement.

Those aren't busy waits in the app, they are waiting for things like the buyer to accept a bid or for bitcoin transactions to be confirmed in the blockchain. Any marketplace will have to wait on these things.

Shouldn't profit be calculated by subtracting what you would have made by investing your fiat directly into bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:38:13
On Bitmarkets, we'll be using GNUstep to port to Linux/Windows. Bitmarkets doesn't need reputation systems or trusted third parties because it uses two party escrow with mutual security deposits.
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:37:29
Yes, profitable in fiat terms. But are you profitable relative to if you had just bought whichever cryptos you are mining with your original capital on the date you first spent any fiat on your project?

In my limited experience, both involve a lot more work than either developers or non developers tend to think.

The time you would have bought them being the same time you bought your mining gear. And I'm only talking about buying then and holding - not trading.
My comment wasn't meant as a criticism. I was only asking the same question I asked myself several years ago when I considered mining: "Am I better off buying the mining gear and power than I am simply buying bitcoin itself with the same capital?" 
I think it's only fair to compare profits wrt default behaviors. If you believe in bitcoin, your default behavior would be to invest in it (not to hold your savings in fiat). Mining would be an alternative way to invest in the same market and should be evaluated relative to directly investing in bitcoin. 
 
Likewise, if you believe the stock market will do well, your default behavior would be to invest in some major indexes (not to hold your savings in fiat). Investing in a hedge fund would be an alternative way to invest in the same market and should be evaluated relative to investing in the major index funds.
