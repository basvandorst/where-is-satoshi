Biggest? Not even close. And they have accepted bitcoin for a long time, they just retract it from time to time.

These fud articles are beginning to look stupid. Never seen anything so desperate in my life.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:24:54
Well... yeah? Your point?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:19:39
A wonderful trade my friend.

I wouldn't call bottom until China wakes up...

35%, fourth highest crash. Nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:44:55
It's going to continue to drop as the chinese exchanges keep shutting down. And when it's truly confirmed that China will will stop trading BTC, it's gonna drop more. Bleeding all the way to the 30th of September.

Good luck being an illiterate.

Then you haven't zoomed out. This isn't even the third biggest dip. 35%, 4th biggest dip.

Judging by the answers I'm gonna guess something that doesn't exist.

If that's your mindset, you should stay far away from volatile investments.

Banks care about control, and when you control the biggest trade resource in the world, you sure have a lot of control.

All of Europe use 30/9, 30/10. No clue where you get your info from.
30/9-17 etc
2017-09-30 if you write an entire date. Just a day is 30/9.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:24:54

Capital gains, pretty much the same in every Country. I'd you don't declare your winnings you're doing a crime. But then again, it's an intraceable currency.

Why? See it as an opportunity to buy more. Why did you even have btc if you didn't believe in it?

Honestly not trying to be rude, just trying to help people not lose faith in what they invested in. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:39:16
Then stop looking at the portofolio and stop looking at the ticker. Go for a walk.

Taxes, fees and not knowing where the bottom is (that's what she said).
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:32:51
Ok then this: Why the fuck are we not mooning now that China is 100% official and done with?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:00:40
Ok then why do you ask if you already know about the alternatives?

If you gain profit on your currency exchange and don't declare it, that's a crime. Same as buying a stock at a lower price and then selling it at a higher price. Capital gains.
