On a probably related note, Bitfi no longer “unhackable” 
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:46:47
Or, hear me out, nobody talks to McAfee anymore.
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:02:36
I mean you’re not wrong but it’s a wallet. It’s not supposed to be predicated in nobody ever seeing or touching it. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:32:24
I mean that IS what people call middle America so you would be right to, I just assumed your comment was in response to something here.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:11:55


Sorry, Linux and Bitcoin. Two of the biggest ones.
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:57:15
Your claims that the NSA could trivially backdoor any open source project has zero merit. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:04:00
Which is effectively physical 
A machine you control has physical access to their machine
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:12:07
The attacker being physically present is a selective definition when the scenarios you describe are all ones other physical attacks can also use to subvert that definition.
Also weird hill to die on. The Bitfi bit is over. May as well move on instead of arguing semantics.
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:02:34
So then what’s your argument for what I laid out?
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:19:40
The current situation isn’t what you’re making it out to be.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:10:26
That's like the 100th forced Venezuelan Bolivars comparison I've heard this week. Everyone uses it as a hot take in hopes people don't google how much that actually is.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:29:38
How is he supposed to do that when he has life w/o parole? You mean flee before he's sentenced?
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:46:09
My understanding was that he wasn’t under the impression they had him caught at the time, hence why the agents had to social engineer his laptop away from him.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:57:29
Perpetually running has been regarded by many who’ve done it as about as bad as prison due to its tiring nature but I don’t think anyone in this thread can judge that unless anyone is a currently wanted international crime boss (not to say DPR is, I think he was but not everyone agrees).
Running probably would’ve just made extradition easier though because countries hate that drama.
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:11:27
Is it? Vendors open up to Bitcoin all the time.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:21:42
Okay. Your claims that the NSA could backdoor Linux and/or Bitcoin successfully are without merit.
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:20:15


You can't use an example of someone WANTING to do something as it successfully happening... with popular large scale open source projects it's pretty F'ing hard to do.


Popular open source projects generally get audited to a pretty aggressive extent


This is "If everyone doesn't read it, did anyone really read it?" logic
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:42:34
Personally disagree with that assessment, but you do you. About 20% of my class did their final technical paper on Bitcoin this semester in college out of literally any technical topic.
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:56:39
I live on the beltway doing cybersecurity - they aren't God. The patch would still have to hit mailing lists, code review, and public scrutiny.
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:21:41
It's more expensive for the upload than it is to store it on disk, you'd probably be losing a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:50:28
The follow up will probably be “he should’ve just been constantly running” which is easier said than done and usually worsens things, at which time I’d cite Kevin Mitnick.
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:20:28
Has unintended side effects, especially if it's a shared host. I'd just leave it to experts.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:57:05
FYI that’s not how open source works
It would be faster to just reverse the app off the device
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:27:59
Not for DPR it doesn’t...?
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:31:58
Except you are significantly more likely to be arrested if you do it in stocks
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:28:40
Why on earth can’t you just exit your tab from it when you’re done caring instead of demand OP tailor their video?
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:29:03
Yikes if you think credit is that simple 
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:33:19
They provide the means to facilitate the credit.
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:25:53
How can you facilitate loans with bitcoin?
EDIT: Blockchain kind of makes sense, 
Bitcoin specifically I don’t get it
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:29:47
A middleman isn’t worthless in all scenarios
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:12:08
It doesn’t get value until it’s traded for materials. Ignoring that, if everyone holds the currency goes stagnant. Only trading something on speculative value is worse than traditional trading because at least in traditional trading there’s non-speculative value (in most cases) behind what you own.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:00:42
Ignoring the fact that it was the top, throwing money at almost anything and just hiding out for 6 months is a terrible idea lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:14:17
Lol I live in the city in DC and haven’t really found anywhere that accepts it
Edit: No idea why this got downvoted, it’s a legit observation
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:19:08
His comment didn't indicate it was open source. Being an open source contributor isn't an all-or-nothing situation.
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:19:54
I just reread this and realized you were calling me a paid MSFT PR guy. This account isn't even anonymous. It's my name. Michael Bailey. I have a history of working on Linux, not much on Windows, and never worked for or represented Microsoft. try again.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:18:44
That's why I'm ignoring it.
Other comments were saying "huehuehue can't believe he took the top", and I'm saying with that aside.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:32:52
This sub is a concerning amount of posts basically saying:
"Something positive about bitcoin!" - Someone who's personally staked their livelihood in Bitcoin's adoption
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:55:45
What does it have to do with BCH? If I was a fan of grapes, and I ran a plane into a building, it wouldn't have anything to do with grapes?
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:48:57
Not the least bit true lol
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:39:02
Is this /s?
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:22:39
Or you can actually use it for what it's intended for rather than holding. It's a currency. Sitting on currency with no intention of doing anything but holding on it isn't a good thing for a currency.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:24:29
I’m not saying you should trade on it’s current market value but I am saying you should be aware of it. If nothing else so you know what assets you have lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:36:03
Your reddit is used to post about your own tweets a *lot*...
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:52:20
What you’ve said isn’t supported by evidence.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:33:59


This is an outdated idea.
Microsoft is one of the major sponsors of the Linux Foundation. They also use Linux. They've open sourced a number of their projects  as well as a number of talks on how they use git.
See  for instance
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:34:12
Didn't know this is Seriously, of course it gets downvoted it doesn't contribute anything lol
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:48:27
or Gitlab
Sourceforge has a questionable history
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:34:12
To be fair, they can show you code that isn't actually in production lol
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:38:22
See hijacking 
Given Bitcoin is an extremely security conscious project that also includes people who many not take the steps necessary to verify downloads that’s concerning to me
I also like Gitlab
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:47:51
Yeah. Basically the moral of the story is if you don't have to trust Keith the Sysadmin with tcpdump, don't.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:27:56
What do you think I’m implying? I’m just saying you shouldn’t blindly hold and should at least have awareness of current conditions.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:20:04
This - somehow I responded in the parent thread oops
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:24:24
No this is just how fraud departments work...
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:28:52
I’m not arguing it doesn’t, but the post indicates it shouldn’t. Gold has material value as a result of its use in commercial applications. Phones have gold in them.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:02:37
Rigs include power requirements though
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:44:56
All of this predates the very leadership today that's embracing open source so I don't see how that helps? ~~Also no idea why they'd tell PR that is the official policy if so.~~ (misread your note) Whole thing doesn't seem very damning.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:10:05
USD doesn’t go offline either, though. This is like exchanges going offline. You don’t have to use exchanges but you also don’t have to use banks.
Also wtf Wells Fargo has always sucked
@_date: 2019-06-09 21:06:49
This feels like a weird thing to celebrate when you consider the actual implications regarding the Argentinian people
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:43:52
I’m not disagreeing with this, but also
1. That’s not what your post says at all
2. You can’t say USD is centralized just  because Wells Fargo is centralized, that’s an oversimplification of USD. A more apt example is the federal reserve. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:13:26
Exactly. 
The whole point is it doesn’t matter if El Chapo got more time because they’re both gonna be dead regardless.
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:15:24
Do you not see similar posts here and elsewhere when Coinbase and other exchanges go offline/by the wayside? Only difference is you can’t walk up to Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:46:32
Only dumb or critically poor people use Wells Fargo because of shit like this. The whole idea of capitalism is voting with your money.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:05:55
For starters, cash
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:47:49
I didn’t say private property
Also yes
That’s quite possibly legal
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:24:32
You aren’t owed any on a private platform
@_date: 2019-04-19 02:58:39
McAfee also said he invented cybersecurity and the whole industry respects him so
@_date: 2018-11-11 04:51:31
Who here even mentioned Monero? lol

Do you use roads? How do you think they actually, you know, get paid for?
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:39:24
Why would it be either? I personally doubt it’s a coincidence but it’s more possible they just did it as a nod to the date. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:34:19
Fun fact, attended his talk front row at DEFCON 22. Dude was a counterfeit Charlie Sheen the whole time. Bragged about his security and people started throwing shit on stage to see what they’d do. It was entertaining but he was pretty much the running joke at the con after that. I always find it interesting (I’m not alone in this) he staked his claim on being respected by the infosec community when the vast majority of the community can’t stand him.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:18:02
....how do you figure? Some CCs have basically no fees
@_date: 2018-11-11 04:55:32
I’m not even loyal to r/Bitcoin it’s just not like you can “come out on top” if you weren’t in the discussion in the first place
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:37:22
You’re allowed to lock accounts in most online exchanges. It’s so they aren’t willfully a part of fraud. Call the cops if it’s an issue.
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:05:16
And yet, you still use them?
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:19:24
Pretty sure you need damages to sue. You'd have better luck getting people who bought bitcoin cash and can argue they meant to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:26:14
Too long to be a title tho 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:53:54


I don't think that's the default for most people honestly. Figuring out something that major is not something anyone expects JP Morgan to. I think the news would call that hacking sooner than anything else, but I guess that's just my interpretation.


tbh not illegal afaik
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:38:59
I personally don’t find it misleading
They committed fraud related to a category. It’s not like when people say wire fraud the wire was what was fraudulent, it was the person.
