I'm not going to pretend to really understand the technology but I know that every adaptation to address a specific use case eliminates the potential for addressing some other use case. Im frustrated that things like Segwit are moving so slowly but I love Jen the big pipe approach with layer two and three adaptations to address specific use cases. Most of the potential uses probably haven't even been identified yet so it think it's short sighted to sacrifice that future flexibility by fixing the fee problem with a bad solution.

"Once you have a list of bitcoin addresses linked to anonymous activity, you can then track the transactions to and from those addresses. By looking at the patterns that emerge, you can build up a "cluster" of accounts and transactions that seem likely to be illegal. "

It's pretty easy to trade CME options overseas or on Globex. There are some international partnerships ( and pretty much anywhere you can buy stocks in us companies, you can also buy Futures and options. 
But I agree with your doubt as to how much the futures market affects the actual market. I'm sure it probably does some but I'm not qualified to guess how. I actually think many of the people who are active in that market and who believe they can influence the actual market aren't qualified to guess how either.

I made the comparison because I think we're closer to the pre-windows PC market than the post windows market. It's not a perfect analogy because Apple is a pc AND an operating system and MS is only an operating system. I was thinking that in a way Bitcoin is like Apple and MS is more like the lighting network. It's a level 2 application and plenty of software developers got right in level 3. Apple was the only one of the big PC makers to even survive as a PC maker. Commodore, IBM, Radio Shack are all either dead or completely out of the PC business.  Apple never regained a dominant market share but it became the largest publicly held company in the world in terms of Market Cap. Right now I think Bitcoin is 1980 Apple and LN maybe has a chance to become Microsoft but that's just as likely to be some other app I've never heard of. I only own Bitcoin, Ether and the few forks that I haven't managed to Changelley into one of those two.

I don't know. I still think that a bit chicken littley. I think of Tether like a money market account for cryptos.  There are about $3 billion of them right now but there isn't any USDT actually in Bitcoin. (I doubt most of it went into Bitcoin in  first place.) But even if did and it is a complete  scam, if someone has traded their worthless USDT for Bitcoin, that person now has Bitcoin and the poor slob who used to have Bitcoin is stuck with their worthless USDT, much like anyone who might have traded Bitcoin for Venezuelan Bolivars or Zimbabwean Dollars. This is just separating the wheat from the chaff, Bitcoin from Shitcoin. Crashing USDT should drive more people into Bitcoin, not out of it.

I still can't completely work out though how this Futures Market will really affect the actual price of Bitcoin because the futures don't directly relate to actual Bitcoins. There isn't a fully developed Futures Market including puts and calls and straddles and all those sort of things so it's hard to say exactly how much real hedging is going on. If you sell a future you're only partially hedged because the price could drop by more than you received in Futures premium and then you would have been better off to just sell the Bitcoin in the first place. You could argue that the guy on the other end of your option might be buying actual Bitcoin to Hedge his position so that creates buying pressure in the market.  Gold miners sell future production on the futures market because they can have a pretty good idea what their future production will actually be. Their mines don't adjust their difficulty every time another miner enters the market. I think it would be pretty risky for Bitcoin miners to hedge future production not knowing how much production there were actually be.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:16:53
I guess I'm not seeing anywhere that anyone has falsified balances.  Just that the auditor has pulled out.  I think if Tether does have the actual dollars somewhere to back these cryptos, they'd be idiots to have it all sitting in physical cash somewhere.  If they have it, it's likely in some form of staggered short term notes or other debt instruments.  How do we know that the issue that caused the Auditor to pull out is with Tether and not with the bank. Some altcoins are clearly shitcoins.  From my experience, all banks are shitbanks.

I think some of the most successful alt-coins over the long term have not been created yet and about half or more if all alts will have a lifespan of less than two years from their creation.

I'm pretty sure if I just hold I'll end up being right in the end.  I really only have to be right once.
If you sell you have to be right three times. First you have to sell when it really is going down and you can never know that for sure. 
Then you have to wait until it goes down enough to make it worth all the trouble and you can never know that for sure.
Then you have to buy again  before sit starts going up again and you can never know that for sure.
If I hold. I just gotta be right once.

There was a time that virtually every home computer in the world was an Apple. (Maybe a few Radio Shacks and Commodores sprinkled in there). It's market dominance was near total. Then several Microsoft based systems came out and Apple's dominance dropped. It was recently still the largest public company in the world. Some alt-coins will be viable and provide a service but Bitcoin has the potential to dominate the space for many years to come.

But there's no guarantee the paper market will be big enough  for 1000 Futures. Right now it doesn't exist at all. They have to be confident they can sell (or buy) enough actual Bitcoin and opposite Bitcoin Futures to actually cause the price change they hope to profit from.

The three long-term capital gains tax rates of 2018 haven't changed in 2019, and remain taxed at a rate of 0%, 15% and 20%. Which rate your capital gains will be taxed depends on your taxable income, and filing status.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:37:12
This is a big issue to me. I have to see at least a 25% dip just to pay the taxes (state and federal) on my long term gains and then I have to hope I don't need to sell again for a full year after I buy back in just to get back to that rate. My hope is that I'll hang onto my very small position until I can retire in a few years and then I can just spend it at the 0% federal long term rate. If I can't afford to just cash out completely now, then I'm pushing the date that I might be able to do that back a year when I try to get cute.

The underground cash economy in India is HUGE, perhaps bigger than the "official" economy. That's why they have basically outlawed cash already and are constantly trying to stop the flow of gold. I have friends in India who say the "official" price of something like a house is like the down payment and then the actual house is usually paid for in cash or gold. The Indian government can't figure out how to tax the underground economy so they are trying to force everyone into the e-banking system. They've already swallowed some pretty tough medicine to eliminate physical cash. It just doesn't make sense for them to allow an outlet in Bitcoin.

They certainly can, but why would they? There is no reason to. They can simply sell the future Naked or if that's too risky, they can hedge by buying a higher strike future to limit their losses.

The Lightning Network is a system for exchanging signed contracts, which entitles various entities access to previously-deposited funds, in a safe and secure way. The bitcoin network acts as the perfect Judge. The bitcoin network can validate any contract with absolute authority and veracity. These contracts essentially act as a mathematical equation to be solved, and the bitcoin network can rigorously and perfectly enforce the terms of any contract submitted to it.
This, in a nutshell, is the genius of the Lightning Network. It is an ambitious and audacious application of ‘smart contracts’; contracts which are not enforced by a real-world judge, but are instead enforced by the power of the bitcoin trust network and impossible-to-hack mathematics.
Avoiding the Old West analogy for a moment, here is a summary of what the Lightning Network actually ‘is’:
● The Lightning Network is an extension of the bitcoin network which uses time-locked, hashed smart contracts to safely exchange value.
● All Lightning Network transactions ARE bitcoin transactions. Admittedly, they are unconfirmed transactions. However, these are transactions which are dependent upon an already-existing and confirmed funding transaction that resides on the blockchain.
● By using smart contracts, Lightning Network ‘transactions’ are not transactions in the traditional sense. Participants are merely signing a contract representing an agreed-upon balance in an existing account. This can be done safely and securely. Not only that, but it also avoids having to publish every intervening transaction to the blockchain. This enhances privacy, security, and has a multiplier effect on the main bitcoin blockchain. It is important to avoid thinking about Lightning Network transactions as something separate from bitcoin transactions—they are not. They actually are bitcoin transactions, and the only thing the ‘network’ part of the term ‘Lightning Network’ does, is facilitate the mechanics of safely/securely signing and forwarding these bitcoin transactions among participants of the system.

Does anyone else think these articles supposedly pointing out the weaknesses in Bitcoin usually end up proving the need for it? There are 51 issues but only a very few are actual problems with Bitcoin (and I do believe there are problems with it in it's current state that eventually must be fixed. And that scaling isn't all if them).  More often they end up pointing out problems that are actually caused by the current financial system. Many of them are problems that blockchain technology could easily eliminate.
  (3).  Bitcoin is a new technological innovation with a very limited operating history.
Pretty general but that's clearly about Bitcoin.
  (44). Bitcoin ETF shareholders will have to deal with K-1 partnership returns for tax reporting purposes.
Does that really have anything to do with Bitcoin in particular? Could blockchains and smart contracts actually make things like this much easier? Doesn't take much imagination to see opportunities there.

I chengellied half of mine into Bitcoin almost immediately and the other half into Ether, I honestly want looking for a gin on the Other. I just wanted a slight hedge and Ether/Litecoin was a coin toss. I do still have a very small amount on Coinbase. I keep about 10% of my BTC there and had some during the split. I think I'll sell the BCH eventually but it's honestly not worth the headache right now.

Good short analogy. The one thing that's missing from our situation is that nobody is actually buying and selling oranges here. They're not selling "oranges they don't own" they're selling "the current price of oranges they don't own".  
With some commodities futures you get the right to buy or sell the physical commodity at some future date (although almost nobody ever does). It's cheaper and easier to just close out the ledger than to figure out how to transport and store a bunch of bushels or barrels of something, but the potential to demand that action exits.  
Bitcoin Futures and options are are more like casino bets on the future price of oranges than actual bets on actual oranges. So the definitions of Long and Short apply, but I honestly have no idea what they will be long or short of.

Both of the Futures contracts announced so far are Cash settled and based on varying baskets of exchange prices but don’t involve any actual Bitcoin. I understand why someone may want to buy some as a hedge before selling the future but there is no reason for them to borrow it to short it. They aren’t selling actual Bitcoin. They are selling a financial derivitive tied to Bitcoin.

I can't speak for all HODLers but I'm absolutely aware that backing Bitcoin is a risky strategy. I do it because I see the alternative lack of risk as almost certain failure. It's like a coach that decides to go for it on 4th and goal to win instead of kicking a field goal just to keep it close. Those coaches that choose to just keep it close almost always lose. The near certainly with that strategy is failure. 
That's actually how I see owning Apple. I think it is likely I could own it and make a little here and there but I'd still be a part of a system that's taking more and more from me every day. Owning Apple is failing more slowly. I think it's almost painfully ironic that Wall Street backers don't see this.  I know at one point I had read that for Apple to justify it's forward PE it would have to sell not one but two iPads or iPhones to EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON THE EARTH.
What? 
How can that even be possible? Three and a half billion people in the world who don't make enough money in 10 years to buy a single iPhone are someday going to own two of them?
Bitcoin is risky and maybe the chance is only one in a million but I'm saying there's a chance.

I think the alt market has significantly muddied the waters for Bitcoin.

Jeff DeGraff of Renaissance market Research brings more bad news to Bitcoin enthusiasts. He advises against investing in Bitcoin if the coin broke out from this year’s support level. "Parabolic moves are notoriously dangerous for short‐sellers … Usually, a top develops that often appears as a descending triangle over months, with reduced volatility and little [fanfare]. Once the top is complete on the support violation, the security in question can often be considered permanently impaired or even 'game‐over'. We are of course referencing Bitcoin as exhibit 'A' in today's market," DeGraff said in a note to clients obtained byCNBC

Don't buy it without their permission. The cost in potential damage to the relationship with your parents is just too high. Instead explain to them that it's really important to you and ask them to consider backstopping your investment. tell them that you still plan to invest as soon as your turn 18 and asked if they would be willing to guarantee today's Buy in price for any future purchases you make after the age of 18. ultimately their concern is that you will lose money but if it goes down and you're buying price actually goes down over the next year then they won't be risking anything.

I think a meaningful distinction between Bitcoin and most currencies, like the Zimbabwe Dollar, is that they are poor stores of value by design. It's true that they can sometimes me managed so that they are a relatively less poor store of value but fiat systems a designed so that they can expand (and in theory contract but that mostly never happens). They exist to allow a certain amount of inflation specifically to prevent people from using them to store too much value for too long. The incentives to use them as a medium of exchange are more compelling than the incentives to use them as stores of value.  The Zimbabwe Dollar is only being mismanaged to a degree. It is mostly doing exactly what it was designed to do, it's just doing that a little faster than some might want. Every currency involves certain trade-off between the medium of exchange and store of value functions. Bitcoin just has the strongest inherent store of value characteristics by Design.
Ironically fans of Fiat currencies love to use the term full faith and credit when describing what gives their currency value. But this inflationary tendency undermines that faith. The power of your bank or your government to stick its hands into your account and take money that does not belong to them also undermines this faith. The full faith and credit characteristics of Bitcoin are somewhat undervalued at the moment but the ability to prove ownership and maintain custody of Bitcoin can also make it a relatively better medium of Exchange. You can't exchange value that's been confiscated by someone.

Anytime that shorts can borrow actual shares (or coins) this is a possibility in theory. It rarely happens because, markets. 
At some point people step in to buy because they believe the price is too low. Since shorting involves selling a thing you don't yet own, the only way to close the position and book the profit is to go out and get it. This eventually causes an upward pressure on prices so "shorting to zero" is probably not possible in reality.
Every Short is a buy just waiting to happen.

Actually, I do wonder about how exchanges work.  I've always imagined that Coinbase was like its own little Lightning Network.  I have always thought they "post" transactions to the block chain when coins go in and out of their exchange but a good bit of their volume is just moving from one Coinbase account to another.  
How do the exchanges really work?
"Today, according to marketcap.com $6.1B dollars worth of bitcoin changed hands. We all know the vast majority of these are flipped back and forth on exchanges (mostly by trading bots), but assuming each trade was for a bitcoin that was not traded further in the 24 hour period, only 753,000 bitcoin are in the 'liquidity pool' (as if bitcoin in themselves are NOT liquid, duh)."

BCashers love to say that they have found a way to solve the scaling problem using a proven technology, but it really isn't proven. Bcash has never really managed blocks that are bigger than 1 Megabyte anyway.  Right now most of their blocks are just in the hundreds of kilobytes. On its biggest volume Day Ever when it did about 8 billion in volume their mempool was getting backed up also. Bitcoin does between 7 and 10 billion everyday and the mempool isn't backed up at all at the moment. In theory bigger blocks might work, but it really has never been tried so there's really no way to know for sure.

Block size has proved to be a remarkably contentious issue throughout the history of bitcoin, keeping Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts at each other's throats. Tribalism aside, both are goofy and outmoded at this point.
Despite the downsides of a larger block size, bitcoin could still have increased it without any real downsides. 8MB might have been a little much, but it was still far preferable to the clogged and useless state of the bitcoin network at the height of December's hype. Bitcoin simply wasn't ready for that level of popularity, which saw it take a step backwards in acceptance. The number of merchants accepting bitcoin actually dropped as it became more popular. Simply raising the block size would have helped enormously, so it's a shame that no consensus could be reached.
At the same time, a bigger block size isn't an actual scaling solution. By itself, it cannot scale to the extent needed, and the downsides make it unsustainable in the long run. But for some reason, the one trick ponies on the Bitcoin Cash development team are at it again.
Bitcoin's own scaling solution, the lightning network, is infinitely more creative, effective and widely applicable than mindlessly bumping up the block size. The only problem is that it's more of a feature for use in specific transaction types than an actual network-wide scaling solution. The only reason it is even being considered as an actual scaling solution is that the inherent deficiencies of bitcoin put more practical solutions out of reach.

We'll, it just so happens that there was a real world experiment to test something similar to this. There was a stripped down and less functional 8mb block coin running side by side with an optomized 1mb Bitcoin for several months and during that time the smaller coin was much more successful. Sadly, the the 8mb coin was ultimately abandoned and no coin of that size currently exists so the experiment is no longer on going.

Lots of confusion surrounding the upcoming hard fork. Some people thinking that they'll end up with two coins (BCH8 and BCH32) and BCH8 will run like BTC did after that fork. They don't realize that the current BCH8 coin will die and only the new fork will continue. I do think it would be hilarious if someone decided to keep mining the BCH8 fork and then they got in a fight over which fork is the "real" BCH.

I think this is also sort of how big runups tend to play out generally. The really interesting thing is that Bitcoin has managed two or three of these.

“Copper is one of the few metals that occur in nature in directly usable metallic form (native metals) as opposed to needing extraction from an ore. This led to very early human use, from c. 8000 BC. It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.”

"In his paper, he also predicts that the market will experience a sustained and sharp growth this year, as institutions approach bitcoin and other currencies with interest as an investment product. But then this will cause an overbought market that will finally fall to its lowest point in many years. Most cryptocurrency related businesses will not survive this fall. But there is a silver lining: he also affirms that after this so-called “cryptocurrency winter”, the market will experience a rebirth like no other, shedding the volatility that it had before, and growing at a steady rate."

I admitted that I don't know whether the funds have actually been transferred to them. But I do know that the funds are available to be able to pay them all. Some of the creditors are actually attempting to prevent the distribution to them because they want the Bitcoin not the value of the Bitcoin on the date of the bankruptcy. The bottom line though is that nobody is pushing to sell. If the settlements haven't been paid yet it is actually partly because the creditors want Bitcoin instead of fiat.

Exactly, we have no idea if they were sold and there are some good reasons to doubt that they will be.

I lived in West Africa in the 80s. The inflation was so bad people just started bundling blocks of bills together without even counting them and trading the blocks by weight. At one point you couldn't find toilet paper in the market anymore. I ask one of the shop keeps why. He pulled out his last roll and a block of bills and said this is how much a roll costs now. But there's more paper in the block than there is in the roll.

Every change in the protocol represents a trade-off between two things, speed and security, cost and centralization, access and trust. Most Alt-coins fail on decentralization or trust from the outset. Bitcoin has not made those trades. If it has sacrificed anything it is quick solutions for the sake of security, decentralization and trustlessness.

The question is whether the "value" that appears to be there now migrates into one of the other viable cryptos or just disappears along with them. Other than BCH, the other top 10 will most likely be ranked in more or less the same order in three years. I've been following the space since 2011 and owned something since 2013.

Yeah, I think the first time you encounter a really revolutionary idea it is mind expanding in a way that makes it a little hard to find your bearings again.  You start probing the extremes a little to figure out where the new boundaries really are.  It's normal part of the growth process and most people find a new stable reality that incorporates this new information and doesn't destroy everything else they believe.  You just have to allow people to work through the process.  
Plus, its an anonymous chat site where you can test out theories and ideas that are maybe a bit beyond what you might say in polite company. People may find a new stable reality but Reddit is not that reality.

1) 2nd later applications like LN. Actually, you could think of VISA as a 2nd later app on regular banking.
2) It's an emerging market so there's a lot of disagreement about it's value. As more people come to understand and use it the price will stabilize. 
3) Forks are crap and eventually people will realize that and avoid them. I can "fork" a dollar bill on the office copier but that doesn't mean you have to accept it as a real dollar bill.
4) Again, 2nd layer. But people confuse the size of the network with the speed of the network. A block is solved roughly every 10 minutes whether you have a hundred or a thousand or a million computers looking for it. Bigger isn't necessarily faster. Smaller isn't necessarily slower.

This is the description on Amazon. It just doesn't sound that even handed to me.
Product description
“A sober riposte to all the upbeat forecasts about cryptocurrency” — New York Review of Books 
“A very convincing takedown of the whole phenomenon” — BBC News
An experimental new Internet-based form of money is created that anyone can generate at home; people build frightening firetrap computers full of video cards, putting out so much heat that one operator is hospitalised with heatstroke and brain damage.
A young physics student starts a revolutionary new marketplace immune to State coercion; he ends up ordering hits on people because they might threaten his great experiment, and is jailed for life without parole.
Fully automated contractual systems are proposed to make business and the law work better; the contracts people actually write are unregulated penny stock offerings whose fine print literally states that you are buying nothing of any value.
The biggest crowdfunding in history attracts $150 million on the promise that it will embody “the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code”; upon release it is immediately hacked, and $50 million is stolen.
How did we get here? 
David Gerard covers the origins and history of Bitcoin to the present day, the other cryptocurrencies it spawned including Ethereum, the ICO craze and the 2017 crypto bubble, and the attempts to apply blockchains and smart contracts to business. Plus a case study on blockchains in the music industry.
Bitcoin and blockchains are not a technology story, but a psychology story.
Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is.

I obviously haven't read it but if the author accepted that as an accurate description I just don't know if the full book is worth my time. FWIW, nobody is building miners out of Video cards anymore and I don't think anyone has mined that way since maybe 2012 or 13. 
People do lots of of stupid stuff to make money but you don't normally hear the money criticized for it. 
Yeah, most ICOs are a scam but I don't see what that has to do with Bitcoin (and this is a BTC sub). BTC was never ICO'd. 
Most ICOs are probably bad for Bitcoin and blockchain without Bitcoin is just an inefficient database. If you think these are rational arguemebts against BTC, you just don't understand it.

I have not seen anything better. Several clone coins have made trade offs that may look good at the moment but in most cases they were tradeoffs that the Bitcoin team considered and discarded. The essence of this whole movement is distributed,  decentralized and open source. The Bitcoin network is the strongest in all of those area. There simply is nothing better.

The creator has not moved a single Satoshi since 2009. There are some early investors who have already cashed out and threw their money at BCH. I'm sure there are developers who own large amounts but whether they are using them to fund outside investments isn't any of my business.  They may or may not but if they do that would be entirely outside of BTC since there really is no way to invest directly in the actual protocol.

I think you can never really know this in advance. People have invested lots of time, energy, and effort into developing the world's most secure open-source distributed ledger. Perhaps it remains to be seen whether there is an actual market that corresponds to those inputs. The problem for now is that we're also reassessing the way we value those markets so what we see as volatility in the "price" is really just a disagreement over the measure we are using. 
In the end, one day we may just not care how many "glass beads" ot "tally sticks" you though it was worth today.

Perhaps it is hoping for too much but one of my dreams for Bitcoin is that it starts to end this tail wagging dog relationship in the markets.  The level of manipulation in some markets (AG, AU for example) makes the spot market for those metals just absurd. People regularly sell several years of production in only a few minutes which drives down the price and certainly isn't the way you would act if getting the best price on your sale was your main concern.  
Unfortunately, there are side markets based in the options price that are many many multiple larger than the $7 trillion spot gold market so if you can move the price in that smaller market you can make big money in the derivitive market.
One of my hopes for Bitcoin is that the  spot ( actual, honest, real?) market will simply ignore the options market. That's the real revolution.
Right now the Vegas casinos (bankers) are basically determining the final score in the actual game. I hope the Bitcoin team will simply ignore the oddsmakers and just go out and play the game.
Just once in my life I want to buy or sell something for what it is worth.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:28:34
Yeah. That's how I see it.
One of the funny things about investing in general is the way the terminology make you conservative. Massive Drops in price are always called "Corrections" as if the price has been wrong and the dump is fixing that. "The Market" is always right but sometimes a small group of overzealous traders can be wrong. None of the talking head are calling this a correction, even though I really think that's what it is. The price was simply wrong for the last year and now it's going back to somewhere near fair value.
If it turns out the price is $100,000 or more at the end of 2020 (as several have projected), could any one now say that it is really overvalued at $11,000? Or that it was overvalued in 2017 at $20,000?  
IF it were to go to $100,000 in a year and a half, then I think we'd still be undervalued now at $50,000. 
There could be a lot of correcting left to do.

Tulips had already existed for hundreds of years and suddenly a bunch of people who didn't really care about Tulips decided to invest in them. Bitcoin isn't a    slowly decaying commodity that suddenly catches the imagination.  It is a potentially world altering technology that  may disrupt the entire world economy.  Imagine if a pest resistant strain of wheat or a vaccine against the plague had been introduced in Europe about the same time as the Tulip craze. (There was a 2nd smaller Bubonic plague outbreak in the 1660's and the memories of the previous plague we're still fresh enough that people were terrified). How much might that have been worth?   Perhaps nobody would have ever invested a penny in Tulips if  the internal combustion engine had been invented a hundred years earlier. People got caught up in Tulip mania precisely because they could not see a truly revolutionary opportunity in the horizon. Bitcoin doesn't cause bubbles. It pops them.

This article presents exactly the sort of argument that makes me wonder how the Financial Industry takes itself seriously (or how anyone else does for that matter).  And I was once a stock broker and financial planner so I know a little about the market. 
The fact is, no relationship exists between Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures other than the hope that this sort of arbitrage will develop.  Buying a Bitcoin future doesn't give you the right to claim actual bitcoin.   So why should a relationship develop between these two similarly named things and any other two things?  Why should I not sell a bitcoin future and buy a Snickers bar?  Surely the difference in price between these two will be greater than the difference between a Bitcoin future and an actual Bitcoin. What if the gap between these two prices never closes because the owners of actual Bitcoin simply don't care how many Snickers bars or Future Snickers Bars I either own or owe someone.  
The Gold futures market drags the price of actual Gold around because the GLD ETF owns actual Gold which it must try and square with its cash flow in and out.  GLD share owners can claim actual Gold rather than selling their shares.  GS options give someone the right to claim or obligation to deliver actual Gold. And the Options, Futures and ETF markets are many times larger than the actual physical Gold market. 
I don't doubt there will be some increase in Bitcoin buying or selling at first because the Banks and Brokers will hoodwink a few into believing there "might" be gold inside a Snickers's wrapper but Bitcoin exists specifically because banks and brokers have been selling Snickers bars and claiming they are Gold for too long. Perhaps actual Bitcoin HODLers simply won't buy it.

"The structure of Bitcoin makes it hard to maintain control. All Bitcoins are accounted for on a decentralized ledger, known as the blockchain, which no single institution controls. Anyone can have access to it, giving free rein to bad actors.
Regulators have not approved investment products tied to Bitcoin because of the likelihood that prices are being manipulated. But exchanges where investors can bet on the price movement of Bitcoin through futures contracts, without having to hold Bitcoins, have gained approval.
Many market watchers have said that for Bitcoin to gain deeper traction with big investors, those investors will have to be able to buy and hold actual Bitcoins.

This is fascinating if you think about it. Why would you ever need to set aside more than an equal value of an asset to offset the risk of losing it? Perhaps because you've leveraged that asset at several times it's actual value in the form of loans? If you only give me one dollar, there really isn't any risk that I can lose more than a dollar. Unless maybe I promise to give that same dollar to eight or ten other people simultaneously. Then if I lost your dollar I'd be in big trouble when just to two of them come ask for the dollar I promised them at the same time.

Hard to address point by point but his main arguments are that it is too slow, too energy inefficient, and too volatile.
So there are lots of reasons to believe that the technology will get faster over time. Actually, it’s pretty hard to think of a technology that DOESN’T improve over time but Lightening Network is a solution that won’t require the underlying Bitcoin network to be that much faster and might allow transaction speeds rivaling those of Visa in the near future. SEGWIT was an improvement to the base layer that made it more efficient and has not been fully implemented yet.
I just have to laugh at the energy inefficiency arguements because they love to take the absolute narrowest view of energy consumption in the banking industry as an example.  Do you honestly believe that the only energy VISA uses is the little trickle that powers those chip readers? All those great big buildings with VISA on them are empty? All those armored cars hauling around dollar bills are solar powered? I think this argument is one of the best indications to me that someone really doesn’t understand what Bitcoin is meant to replace. 
And Yes, it’s volatile. Did they think Satoshi would mine that Genesis block and proclaim it equal to all the money in circulation in the world and everyone would say, “OK. Guess I can just burn this green stuff then.”? If one Bitcoin is only worth $8,000 then it isn’t really a potential global currency. The only way for it to go from virtually nothing to a value in line with any other major currency (or perhaps all other major currencies) is..........volatile.

Now his job is to safeguard those assets until their final disposition can be determined. I also wonder how much this is affected by Japan's recent decision that Bitcoin is a currency. He can't really say that he's cashing out when he sells because the government of Japan has already determined that what he has is essentially cash.

OK,  I mostly agree that for all but the top half dozen or so coins on that list, its absolute crap. I always sort mine by daily volume, not market cap but the top three are always Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and I think that's mostly real.  BCash is sometimes in the top three market cap but not even in the top seven volume wise. I don't know what to think about Ripple.

I'm not sure why people believe that whales are still buyers or in any way manipulators. Some of the biggest whales were just middle income Joes who were into the tech and suddenly found themselves sitting on a fortune. If they've cashed in at all then they are probably comfortable for now and willing to sit and wait. It doesn't make sense to me that someone who  basically hit the lottery to become a multi-millionaire would then risk it all to become multi-millionairier. Whales are HODLers.

Inflationary currencies have been made obsolete by the pace of innovation. When things barely ever changed then inflation was necessary to keep money circulating. In deflationary times you could afford to wait for prices to come down. Now the opportunity cost of innovation far outweighs the benefits of deflation. I can't sit on my iPhone because honesty, compared to the newest one, it sucks. I have to upgrade my desktop because even at two years old it's so slow as to be basically unusable.  Even my toaster has become a pain  in the arse because I can't make my toast pop up  from shower so that it's warm the same time as my coffee.

It is true that the price dropped and that Mt Gox trustee sold but to say that one thing caused the other is a bit of a stretch. I think the big final sell of 18,000 coins at the low is hard to ignore but nothing goes up 4X in a month and doesn't cone back down a little afterward.

It's frustrating that nearly every report mentions that he might sell the rest soon.  He has not said anything to indicate that.

Perhaps it looks bad right at the moment but when he first gained control of those coins they were possibly not worth enough to clear the roughly 450 million dollar Mount gox debt. In the end he sold 1/15 of them and covered the entire outstanding debt. Overall I'd say he looks pretty shrewd.

Take this money from what you would have spent on coffee or a dinner out or the movies. You can't risk your retirement money or your kids school money or a down payment on a house on speculation.

In fact there really is no such thing. It is redundant since technically all radios  are wireless but the term was commonly in use in the US throughout the 1930's.  Telegraphs and telephones both predate wireless communication so people understood that technology when the radio was invented.  Since it was a new invention nobody really had any idea what a radio was. The term wireless radio appeared more often in print than simply the word radio until the the late 1930's when the technology caught on enough for the average person to have been exposed to it and to no longer need the wireless description. 
But that's really my point. Bitcoin is so much more than internet money or virtual currency but it's still so new that the word Bitcoin is still mostly meaningless to most people.

You know, the ironic thing for me is that I actually have more bitcoins now than I had a year ago yet I also sold off the Shitcoin forks to repay my original investment and pocket 4x my original investment in cash.  I also used some Shitcoin to buy a little Ether and I have 3x as much money in ETH right now as I originally invested in Bitcoin.   And the current value of my Bitcoin even now is still 20x the cash I originally put in back in 2014/15.  I didn't just HODL, I harvested the forks and now I have MODL.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:58:54
I did most of my buying in the $200's. My highest purchase as at $505 (and I regretted it for almost two years). I sold half my initial investment a year ago at just under $1,000 (that's my  only Bitcoin sale) and 4X my initial investment in shitforks in Aug and Dec. Technically, if it would drop all the way to zero the worst I could possibly do is about 450%.

One of the things I always told my clients is that "Risk" is a neat investor term but in reality Risk=Loss. All of that alpha, beta, R squared stuff is cutesy but in the end its really just variations of Standard Deviation. That deviation is caused by prices that go down.

I appreciate your respectful replies and I. Did not intend to get into a tit-for-tat back and forth. I think the basis of our disagreement is whether or not it is fair to include cost that are necessary for banks but not necessary for Bitcoin in the comparison. I believe it is because I believe it is those cost that Bitcoin was invented to eliminate. It is possible that I have more confidence in Bitcoins ability to replace those things then I should.

I created a new Reddit ID a few months ago because I accidentally gave away too much personal information last summer so I'm not about to out myself again. I'm hardly a whale but I'm just trying to make the point that a whole lot of people who made long-term investments with 5 or 10 year timelines have made enough to have pulled out several times their original investment and have no reason to consider selling again until it hits some of their upper limits.  Personally, I decided to sell at 1,000, 10,000,  &amp; 100,000 and then pass anything more on to my kids.  I never expected the shitcoins so I sold them instead of selling at 10,000. I'll continue to sell shitcoins that come along but until the total value of Bitcoin begins to approach the total value if all the world's gold, I will continue to believe that the risk to reward  favors HODLing.

That's a pretty simplistic view. How many miners will stay in business at 1 cent? What would the hashrate likely be with those few remaining miners.   
The ability to adjust the difficulty and maintain the roughly 1 block per 10 minute rate is one reason the network will never die no matter the price. Someone will continue to run miners and nodes and as long as just three or more do that, Bitcoin lives.

Maybe the analogy of a debit card is easier in that way. As long as you know your debit card number, expiration date and security code, you can't really lose your debit card. It's just that for  Bitcoin that security code is a really long number so a hardware wallet is just a device designed specifically for that purpose. One of the drawbacks of a debt card is that once you give someone that code you have to worry about what they'll do with it so the other nifty thing a hardware wallet does is assign a new security code every time you use it so nobody can just remember yours and use it again. 
Ultimately, that code is also like the serial number on a dollar bill. Every one is unique so you can quickly make sure your bill is real by making sure nobody has that  same number.
Wallets just help you do that. (I assume you know this but that's how I'd start to explain bit to someone who doesn't)

I'm also not sure that is really true. I read a comparison recently that Bitcoin used as much energy as the entire country of Denmark (about $350 Billion). But Bitcoin processes that value of transactions every 30;days or so depending on volume. From that perspective Bitcoin is relatively efficient already. There really aren't many other endeavors that allow such a long easy cost to energy consumption comparison as Bitcoin because few things are as efficient Bitcoin. It is nothing but computers running on electricity. It doesn't burn electricity and diesel fuel and jet fuel.  I don't know how you'd really even quantify the true energy consumption of the average bank considering cost if transporting it's employees to and from work and feeding and housing them all day. All of Bitcoin's energy consumption is right there in a little bundle for anyone to see, so it's an easy target. But the more you look at it, the more efficient it appears.

I hope, or rather I hope they hope, that this is true.  I have do doubt that the powers that be will attempt to manipulate Bitcoin just like they manipulate everything else.  I think they probably believe they have taken control and are just about to squeeze.  And that might very well succeed if Bitcoin isn't what I think it is.  If I've been wrong all along and Bitcoin is just another new emerging market, not so different from hundreds of others that they've managed to crush, then I think we could follow the path of Gold, Silver, Uranium, all those other "bubbles".  If Bitcoin is really just another way to make money.
But Bitcoin isn't any of those other markets.  It is the Anti-Market, financial Kryptonite to the established powers. It is the One Ring that Rules them All. Its purpose isn't to make money, but to REMAKE money.  They think they can win the same old game, playing by the same old rules.  They don't realize that the game has changed. They are looking at the wrong scoreboard.  By the time they realize they have lost control they will be irreverent, just an amusing footnote in history about how backward those horse-and-carriage financiers really were back then.
 If Bitcoin is what I think it is.

That "migration" would not have been possible because BCH hard forked at the beginning of August and Segwit wasn't activated until the end of August so for those twenty-some days there was no Bitcoin Cash/Segwit distinction to be made. There was only Bitcoin and the coin that forked away from it. Whether BCH remains truer to the original vision is perhaps an interesting debate but that coin has only 1/10 the activity of BTC and far less activity than the pre-fork volume. Its teeny-tiny especially if you take away the volume of those who mistakenly use it thinking it is BTC.  Just before the fork BTC was doing about a Billion a day in volume, or roughly double or triple the current volume of BCH.  If you assert that BCH is the One True Bitcoin, then I think you also have to admit that that coin is failing.

"However, when Bitcoin suddenly shot up on Thursday, the online chatter was mostly about the White House’s military threats against Russia in Syria, its sanctions on Russia and its tariffs on China, with people speculating that Russians and Chinese might be buying into Bitcoin to quietly get their money out of those countries."

These questions are pointless. If someone knew for certain that it would reach a specific level at some point, it would be at that level now (give or take a small percentage for the time value).

This is the exchanges themselves, not traders on the exchange? Their Quarterly estimated taxes were due in Dec or Jan depending on their fiscal year.  The filing deadline vwasnMarch for partnerships and S Corps. Only C corps are due in April but they still had to have paid 90% of their anticipated tax in January.

If you have a regular walket just scan the smaller one (probably the public key) and then you can check the blockchain to see what's actually there. If you want to actually deposit it just scan the other code too. You should get a prompt asking for it.
You should also have an option to sweep a paper wallet. There may also be an option to Import but if you didn't generate the private key yourself then sweeping is safer.

I think Iruwen's answer is pretty good.   Maybe its "cool" that BCH can use great bigh blocks but the reality is nthat they can't even fill BTC sized blocks.  BCH's last 10 blocks ranged from 7 KB  to 436 KB nowhere near 32MB, or even 8MB.  
BTC last 10 blocks ranged from 539KB (which is oddly small) to 1.18 MB. 
So far BCH has only had 6 days in its history where they would have averaged blocks large enough to fill BTC sized blocks.

This isn't a fair paradigm.  Plenty of things that just didn't work out were not "scams". Something better just came along.  Betamax wasn't a scam. Neither was the VCR or the DVD but Netflix has proven to be the most current "future". 
If it turns out not to be the future, that doesn't prove that it was once a scam. There are very hard working and talented people working to try and make it the future.  They may be wrong but they are not being dishonest.

Coinbase is a bank. For now, since most wealth is tied up in traditional banking there is a need for an onramp.

The market is the market. The price is the price. If he's arguing that the valuation is crazy high then his points can't be valid. That's not how markets work. Every transaction basically represents a minor disagreement between two parties over what the price should be, but it is what it is.

Im really sceptical of the MtGox sale claims. The creditors are paid. The remaining assetts don't belong to the Trustee.

I'm not sure why you'd need it anyway. Yesterday everyone was hysterical about BTC fees going up but we're back at 2s/b  transactions this morning. At the moment they are both mostly clearing their mempools on the next block. Most of the stuff I've seen says that BTrash without Segwit has the potential to do about 24 X as many transactions per block. But to really be cash or compete with Visa it needs to be way faster than that. Maybe 10 times faster than that. And that's just assuming the money transfer function. With smart contract and internet of things functions maybe it has to be 100 times faster. It's like adding 32 propellers to a biplane. Maybe youll get faster take offs for a time but you'll never get to the moon.

What a bunch of hoo-ha. The recent drop from 19000 down to 3,000 wasn't the greatest buying opportunity but the impending drop from 8300 down to 4700 will be? Maybe my math isn't that good, but I'm not sure how that make sense.
I get so tired of these silly predictions, it's going to go up a lot but first it's got to go down a lot or it's going to go down a lot but first it has to go up a lot. My prediction is it's going to go..... a lot.

Darren? No way! You're on Reddit!? You don't even own an alarm clock.

Perhaps ironically, I first became interested in Bitcoin after learning of the popularity of mPeza in the street markets in Kenya. It replaced a system that was almost 100% cash and mostly not connected to reliable electricity. 
The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money. Users are charged a small fee for sending and withdrawing money using the service.[3]

You can claim the losses against the gains. 
It's the net result of all short term trades that were closed during the tax year that matters. 
If you had $500 in "wins" vs $400 in "losses" then you made net $100. That's all the IRS cares about.

Not sure how many official diplomas or transcripts you've had to pay for to apply to a grad school or professional license but over the years I've spent plenty.  
This would have saved me hundreds of dollars back at a time that I didn't have many dollars.

I'm not clicking the link until you tell us something about what it says there.

Zero. I don't have any Bitcoin. Why would I own Bitcoin? I don't even know why I'm even reading this sub. 
I dont own any.

You're lucky. 
I found a wrench at Home Depot for one tenth of the cost this sub had lead me to believe and the tax was really small.
But when I got home I found out it was a screwdriver.

Actually, thank you for this.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:04:13
I love how you think..

But I shouldn't have to continue to pay them to prove it over and over again.

You think Amazon is never gonna charge anybody for that?

I love how you think nobody knows why this is happening....

Thanks for your review. I download the wallet but haven't transferred anything to it yet. This give me a little more confidence.

Unless he is buying and selling from himself, it's never just one guy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:30:05
Yeah. Thanks for reminding. You out gotta take a month off with no trades at some point during the year.

I don't know, was this really a crash? Not long ago we are flying at about 3,500 feet And over a fairly brief period of time we climbed up over 8,000.  Now we seem to be leveling off somewhere between 7000 and 8000. I wouldn't call this a crash so much as a minor change in altitude. I think when you're crash there are twisted pieces of metal strewn across the countryside. This doesn't even qualify as a hard landing

Look. I get it. Trey hurt you. He fooled all of us. But if you want YOUR 48,000, you know where they are.  
Do the right thing.
