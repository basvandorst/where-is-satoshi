This person is just donating random funds to random charities, which is awesome! I hope they also build houses for the homeless too, it's a growing problem and I hope they can help them. If I had the funds I would.

Tell them to go fuck themselves because they are nothing but thieves. It's your money and hard work spent

Will it get me more btc?

The human fund ;P I run it!

Bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:15:32
The dollar is an inflated debt backed centralized currency built on an idea of greed and deceit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:49:29

Taxes like this are also illegal because it's not like they helped at all in order to make this achievement.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:35:36
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:57:50
Why would you revert back to fiat? It's inflated and built on debt.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:08:25
I hope you still have that 800 BTC you luckily recovered! If so you are one lucky person! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:30:36
DO you see warning signs before a bubble pops? Next time you take a bubble bath or blow bubbles look to see if there is a warning sign before it pops. That will answer your question. Unless bubble moans loud enough when you blow him you'd know. See what I did there?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:44:44
Sing it to me
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:43:09
It does matter, it only doesn't with that attitude. Not all taxes do what you think they do either with all the corruption.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:41:42
No

You found the article but did you actually read it? Don't carry it and it will not get stolen. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:56:11
Hitbtc was fine. It sounds like you are unfamiliar with all the available exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:02:49
Man there are so many newbies now, most of these posts are coinbase questions that could probably be answered in their FAQ. Unless they don't have this info in there, which wouldn't surprise me since they suck. Glad I left em.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:35:30
Do you not care about money? One thing I notice with cryptocurrency (been doing this for over two years) is it's easy to forget that this is real currency since it's all digital. Remember to treat it like real currency. Keep it safe, keep it secret Frodo.

I didn't know about bitcoin until last year. I would have invested more if I found out sooner because I trust myself over others. I find it fun to take risks.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:16:58
It's going to drop after the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:47:19
Wash your hands afterwards

It is cool thanks for noticing! I didn't know we were bros! Awesome!
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:39:51
Why are people so negative and afraid of change? It's inevitable.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:35:37
Crypto will eventually replace refunds too since it's difficult to issue those ;p

How much was the transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:07:56
All the people who had the Would have Should have Could have bought it low now have their opportunity but instead they just FUD and shit on it. I don't understand humans, you have the opportunity to make up for your regrets but instead you call things a bubble and attack it because you're afraid. I was born in the correction many years ago.

Why did he sell? Whenever someone is going to sell for a loss you have to ask the following questions.
Do I need the fiat?
Why am I doing this?
What is my goal?
Where do I see this by EOY?
When people sell and buy into a coin they forget they are basically becoming a new adopter again because they are buying at a higher price than where it was a year ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:20:27
Hey remember when this was an ATH and now people are dreading this return? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:33:20
The problem here is people going from a centralized currency to a decentralized currency then back to the centralized one. Defeats the whole purpose of crypto. You're supposed to fight the Sith not join them! 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:33:48
Sounds like they lack QA
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:34:08
My exit plan, sit on your hands and don't touch! This also another strippers rule for you. BTC won't go to 0, crypto will survive thick and thin, crypto will win. It's the future regardless of what people say. There will always be FUD because anything that is new and can bring drastic change will always have this. I am sure people laughed at the Ford model T thinking it wouldn't replace their horse. Crypto is a currency and the goal is to replace the current broken system. Will it? Eventually. Will it be BTC? No, but something else will replace it. Perhaps $DGB or something that is fast, cheap and easy also like me.

They will when the centralized currency collapses
