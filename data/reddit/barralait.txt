Hey sorry for the delay!
I think it will impact newcomers for the sole reason that the value that they buy on one day could be completely different the other day. Price is bound to be even more volatile than it is today, and by more volatile I mean more frequently and with bigger dips and summits.
And how do sellers do that? I'm no economist, I'm just trying to learn and understand ^^

Thanks so much for this post. I like your vision and your explanation of how things could be, and this post is definitely precious for my thinking about how to regulate bitcoin effectively.
First time doing this, and I have yet to be able to buy more so sorry for the amount but have 100 bits !

Sorry, didn't have much time to come back here and think this is over recently! Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to post the article once written :)

I guess adoption would be a curve symmetrical to the monetary base curve with respect to the central axis?
I don't get your point though.

Care to develop? 
Specifically: I get the idea that, inversely (or should we say, as a corollary?) to inflation, here each unit of currency would *gain* purchasing power instead of losing it. That's actually great for long-time hodlers and Spartans, but I'm more concerned about the average Joe that will want to enter the bitcoin economy. I feel it's terrible for future newcomers.
Also, for sellers: how are you supposed to fix prices if the currency value is constantly evolving?
Thanks for your answers.

You obviously didn't read my comment. It's not about democrats vs republicans (actually, I'm French and I hardly give a shit about U.S. politics), it's about having the front page of a sub dedicated to **bitcoin** filled with *Rand Paul*. In this case, the post clearly doesn't follow the community rules.

So is this or ?
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:21:13
Yeah I got my eyes on that ofc! Hope they heed the community's advice before going on

I'm saying that 'cause I keep seeing "Rand Paul this, Rand Paul that" posts here. The filibuster of the renewal of the Patriot Act, although a great thing, is not bitcoin related...
From the rules

I'm a law school student in France and currently doing an internship in a law firm where my boss, a badass new technologies lawyer, asked me to start researching what could be a good regulation for bitcoin, allowing it to grow and yet protecting consumers, merchants and fighting illegal uses.
I of course have my share of ideas, but was wondering what the feels of the community are on this subject?

Thank you for this. Most people in this subreddit don't seem to understand this simple fact. Third party sites are the best thing that can happen to bitcoin, and we need good and reliable ones. Shrugging problems away by saying "just be your own bank" is so aggravating...
