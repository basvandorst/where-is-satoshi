I have 7 dollars on bit pay. I plan on saving for a while anyway. Should I just get a hardware wallet asap and send the funds there and just learn more about everything or..?
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:00:13
Why would they do that aren't they a honest company? That sounds bizzare.
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:08:01
Can you say the last paragraph again sorry.. I def get everything else though. I'm def good after that it's great that you told me this much. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:53:51
I guess the main question is, for someone's who's tryin to start out and put anywhere from 10 to 100 dollars in my balance what route should I take? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:34:27
Right seems like that's all I need to know! The real dirty money. Haha idk but yeah makes sense.
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:48:50
So if I use coinomi I have to pay a fee to use it? Sorry to ask 
@_date: 2018-10-31 04:58:13
Ok thanks a lot I'm assuming the booklet it comes with will guide me a bit also.
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:13:16
I don't need to type the seed into the computer right? So your saying keep it on the device Since it gives that option? What do you mean once my balance has a balance some? You mean just a balance in general? Like I said that's pretty much it and I'll be good 
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:24:31
A paper wallet is a software wallet right? And you mean just keep the codes in a safe spot right? 
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:36:18
Fees for using the wallet app? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:22:08
Thanks so when I send to the wallet or send from it I have to plug it into my computer and connect it online? I have Linux is that ok? Lubuntu. How can I check my balance and all of that? Through the device or on my computer? I can't add it as a wallet on bitpay right? Don't need to? 
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:01:43
So I wouldn't see my balance go up in my wallet? I once I attempt to convert it/trade it in that's when I would know the value? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:55:42
I meant address my bad. Bitcoin address or in this case wallet address. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:28:56
Practice recovering backups? You mean like delete the app and put the phrase in? Stuff like that? Thanks for all the help by the way I pick up on almost everything right away. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:09:03
Ohh ok I see. Yeah that's definitly good practice for someone like me. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:05:42
Right I'm so pumped up for my first 5 tonight. Way better then playing the lottery at least lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:00:46
Say that part about the recovery verify function again. Your basically just saying verify that the seed is valid right? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:43:05
If bitcoin goes up is my best bet to sell it on coinbase so they can just simply buy it from me and make it easy? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:18:24
I was going to get a Trezor. So I send the funds to the hardware address which kind of stores the money nowhere? And when I make a transaction that's when it accesses it through the keys? And when I want to use the hw wallet to transfer funds I do that on the wallet by it's self or does it have to be plugged onto the computer? Thanks I know I'll get it im getting ahead of myself kinda but I'm getting into crypto and investing so I'm just asking a lot 
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:42:04
Ohh ok so if I sell to coinbase it handles that for me and gives me an exact amount based on the value minus the exchange fees? It sends it to my bank account or pay pall?  Is it like 5 or 10%? It's not a set amount? Also can I redeem all of the bitcoin for an Amazon gift card? Why wouldn't I be able to get a visa and put a lot of money on it? Thanks that's pretty much it sorry 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:24:25
Ok but somehow it's still secure even though it's connected to the internet? Yeah I was on the right track with saying the funds are stored nowhere. Still a little confusing but I don't need to know about that part. Soo if I want to redeem or sell how should I do that if bitpay is iffy? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:28:44
Redeem Amazon gift cards though bitpay. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:26:25
I have bitpay for now but what other wallet would you sujjest I use? Since apparently bit pay is iffy. I mean Amazon you can redeem instant maybe ill go on a shopping spree lol. And when I get my hardware wallet it's ok to only use a hw wallet and ditch the software wallet right and just sell or redeem using the hw wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:12:38
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:25:14
Meaning sending or redeeming from the wallet. I'm assuming I'll be doing everything on the computer and not the trezor?
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:05:12
Ok thanks a lot. Should I use coinomi as an app? I heard it's the best and you can redeem visas and Amazon cards? Pay pall? That's pretty much it thanks. Well I guess one more thing. If the value goes up and you can just exchange it for visas and things why do people sell it? Dumb question maybe but yeah confusing a little. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:56:54
Thanks for the info. Yeah thats what I meant. Redeeming for a visa off bitpay. Also with Amazon on bitpay since it has an option to instantly redeem. So my options are Amazon gift card, the visa, coinbase, and then a separate exchange where I don't have to pay as much fees?
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:52:55
Is my best bet to just let it sit in the account and possibly grow? Get a hardware wallet? If bitcoin goes up my wall balance automatically goes up with it right? Isn't that the same thing as selling it in a way? I'm assuming you can sell it for more than it's worth that's why? But let's say if I start with 200 it goes up to 2000 I redeem a visa or something that's possible? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:04:29
So what should I do at that point? Send my funds to a hardware wallet? Do I send funds to the hw wallet the same way I receive bitcoin? Through an address? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:46:09
Get paid to like a survey site. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:26:54
Ohh ok thanks so I can transfer to my bank and sell to usd on Gemini? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 05:02:46
Yes I have two just in case one goes down. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:47:39
Well I guess once I'm done delete the account or unlink bank info? Aside from that yeah doesn't seem like much I can do besides use an account that isn't as valuable. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 03:45:10
And just plug it in your computer when you need to. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:32:17
If I'm a guy who doesn't care about my id and I'm not doing anything bad then I'm good kind of thing? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:21:41
I'm just worried since I don't want to screw myself any info at all is appreciated. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:39:00
I guess I'm basically asking. Can I use a bank account linked to a prepaid for a bank deposit or wire transfer and if so which one should I use? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:09:08
Well all of coinmarkets cyrptos are up by a few percent for almost each some at 6 or 7 one is 10 which is cash.
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:32:31
And once I transfer it to usd it stays as usd the exact amount untill I withdraw it from a bank account Right?
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:17:23
As long as it's free? Thanks I understood everything but that you made it seem like it has to be free and not preference. A cost per month impacts something? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:19:33
So local bitcoins is another site where I can sell to usd and transfer to bank? Any other good sites?  just asking since I want a backup or two in case one goes down
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:31:13
I  have a chase liquid prepaid card. So any other card in either name is out of the question? Ok got it. I'm not going to buy I just want to transfer it to my bank account. I can transfer it to a prepaid debit card? And to transfer the cyrptos to usd before I withdraw it doesn't require a payment method right? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:50:50
Ok thanks a lot yeah all my passwords are crazy long. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:09:54
I'm so mad that I didn't buy all the cyrptos like months ago. Hell even weeks ago. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:21:22
You use that to buy right? Soo correct me if im wrong all you need for a card or bank is when you buy and when you want to transfer to bank? I don't need a payment method to sell right? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:31:29
Can you explain that part again? Are you basically saying it's a risk for id theft to use any exchange and I should get a dif bank account after I'm done selling all the crypto? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:40:14
Nah it's from a gpt site. With that said when I redeem 5 they take out like 50 cents is that normally or are they playing me? Lol and would it be 50 cents for 20 dollars or 2 dollars? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:33:45
Yeah I just realized/read a few minutes ago. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:37:14
Like if I'm on the fbi wanted list or some crazy shit? I feel like you don't know mind taking and as you can see I pick up pretty quick and never ask the same thing again for the most part. With that said lmk if it gets too much I don't think I have a whole lot more to ask. So since I'm going to take the risk how can I minimize my risk for theft from my info? Securing my devices on my network and network itself/firewall? Only allowing certain points? For coin base I use the two step auth app I'm not sure if that's better then the phone text but yeah I use that. Thanks a lot. And yeah I'm so glad they allowed me to open a checking account. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:45:09
What exchange did you sell it on? Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:30:33
Say that last part again.. and I can open a checking account I'm going by tomorrow so I'm glad that's out of the way. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:28:29
Ohh ok any other site that does the same that you would recommended? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:19:39
I thought it was just like buying something off a site? I'm just new to an exchange. So if I don't have a debit card that's not prepaid yet will I be ok if I just transfer the cyrptos to usa and it'll stay there untill I can put it on a debit? To do a wire transfer or add a bank account needs to be a non prepaid account Right? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:11:55
Coin market cap
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:48:21
Good I'm trying to go shopping on Amazon!
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:57:24
Oh yeah because that was such a good one.
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:11:40
Right I didn't see a change in my balance. I only have bitcoin 7.75 us. Still though I would have seen a change already 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:20:48
Ohh ok right thanks 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:35:22
I'm just asking your the one that sounds feminine telling me to cry elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:23:35
Thanks, when I order the card am I able to load it right away also? Like if I ordered the card I wouldnt have to wait untill I get it to load money on it right? Can I order the card by just paying the 9 dollar fee and not loading it? I probably wouldn't do that but maybe so just asking. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:02:48
Someone just told me it was because of Halloween but then he deleted his comment I didn't read the whole thing 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:12:14
I'm assuming anything else would be prepaid also right? Yeah I can't use a card or account in someone else's name so I guess I'm screwed well see. I heard there's a few places where you can still open an account like a second chance account. It should work I'm assuming. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:02:35
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:10:34
Yeah thanks I did a test transfer just to see so now I have some balance. I use dif wallets. I'm on my way to chase it's been 5 years I should be out of check systems. Just asking to you know another good site with wallets that can allow me to transfer to usd/withdraw from bank account/pay pall. ( I head pay pall is risky ) I forget why.
