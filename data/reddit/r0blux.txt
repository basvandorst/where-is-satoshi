Bullshit, 25% is for stocks n shit. Cryto is taxed with the same rate as your income and if u hold it for longer than a year, crypto gainz are tax-free

does anyone know what's the tactic behind this? How come some pool accept BIP91 and then change their mind and don't accept it a few hours later...

yeah, maybe try

right-click on the transaction, then details. There you can see the confirmations (probably 0 Confirmations right now). 
Just wait, it takes some time. It took an hour last time when I did a transaction, so no reason to be worried

75% now, we are getting closer :O
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:27:38
Hashrate right now is 6 000 000 TH/s
2% of that is 120 000 TH/s 
An 1099$ Antminer S9 has a hashrate of 13.5 TH/s. 
So we need 8900 Antminers S9 which are worth 10 million USD to even have a chance so bridge the 2% gap...
good luck

Public Blockchain?

not the slightest chance. You have no idea how powerful those ASICs are compared to our regular destop computers. The hashrate of a powerful destop PC might be around 100MH/s. So unless there are 60 million users in the subreddit we dont have a chance. 
Sorry :( I would love to see segwit2x log in as well
