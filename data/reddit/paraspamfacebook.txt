Please read what they say about Bitcoin before this kind of prediction. 
They hate Bitcoin as much as the Euro (Le Pen).

Kraken.... You have no excuses now to return the BTC fees to where they must be. 
0.001 is a stole to your clients rights now... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:25:20
Their spectrum 48k server seems a little stressed...
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:54:18
3 options:
1-it can go up
2-it can go down
3-stay sideways
You are welcome.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:54:04

Panic selling for no real reason. Someone is buying very very cheap....

@_date: 2017-09-01 07:59:14

@_date: 2018-11-12 14:35:29

@_date: 2017-05-25 07:37:16
No one knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:29:53

Can't wait to see:  (10.000)
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:14:12
I don't see it... Jihan monopolizes all the bitcoing mining hardware right now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:35:34
increasing like this days for 3 years about  1 btc = 100k$
So 20k$ could be a more realistic value.
But with big dips and bullruns in the middle.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:45:54
Not agree, if the "Real Satoshi" starts to move his bitcoins, believe me, it matters.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:16:51
it's just only me or the pumps are accelerating?
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:27:13
1599 $ right now....
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:30:54
"Jihad" Wu just only wants to keep their unfair adventage in their mining hardware. This is not about fees or anything else.
I really think that this will only end with a hardfork not good for anyone.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:12:30
"only if consensus reach 95%" and 95% is impossible without him...
so not, he is not going to accept the fix. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:47:42
this seems the reason....
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:34:08
Big news, that could be a slap in the face of jihan plans.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:24:50
Everytime Jihan appears everything starts to dump.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:28:50
as soons as jihan stops with the fuckering
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:25:47
I don't think so, It's only to gain time
