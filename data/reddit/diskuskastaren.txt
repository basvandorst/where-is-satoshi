Maybe the right translation could be futures. But anyhow, for example, I bought 20 "shares" to a rate of 50€ each in Bitcoin XBT Certificate, (the exact translation to english is certificate in my language but I guess that could be wrong then).

I wasn't clear about my question. I meant to buy a part of a Bitcoin certificate instead of buying the an actual Bitcoin. 
Whats the difference?

I'm going to guess that he meant it as of the top 5 cryptocurrencies atm. But yes indeed very strange for him to say such a faulty statement.

Ah okey! Thanks for the explanation!

Everyone talks about how USD is backed by nothing but faith. But what is Bitcoin backed of then? Newbie asking

The way she ended it with investing in ONE bitcoin is probably going to keep confuse people about the whole ”I can’t afford 1 bitcoin so therefore I can’t buy it”. 
Anyhow, I think she did a great job spreading awareness about digital currencies.
