With Mempool going down some the past couple days....I wonder if Coinbase has actually started implementing batching but not announced yet??
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:55:23






technically yes, but it would take billions of billions of years to try all combinations

For hashrate to go up, is that soley a result of more miners/hashing power coming online? That much new capacity in such a short period?

Basing that on the interviews Mike has given where he touts coins other than Bitcoin, and also on the focus of his investments via Galaxy Digital, investing $15 mill to "tokenize illiquid assets" - which sounds like altcoin/ico nowheresville.
side note: To tokenize liquid assets, rely on BTC as underlying blockchain and use this: 
Also his recent touting of his "great" dinner with Roger Ver and his "disappointment" that people called him out for saddling up to that scammer
**But**...just yesterday Novo tweeted this, so seems like he is seeing the deadend of alts and he may be righting the ship:  
He and Roger:
Investments/promotions of alts/tokens/etc

Thanks and congrats to all the 30+ Devs!

Congrats on your gains. The safe and smart thing to do is calculate your capital gains tax and pay it.
Coinbase will send the IRS a statement on your gains (if CB follows the same process they did last year). 
Services like [bitcoin.tax]( are useful for calculating tax if you have a lot of transactions.

Congrats and thanks.
Is the LN node also a fully-functioning Bitcoin node? I know the LN node is built on top of a running bitcoind service...does that underlying bitcoind service also function as a fully standalone bitcoin node?

1) Eclair is excellent all around, and it supports Lightning transactions. Can't get any better than that.
2) Samourai is great and would be the best but it does not support Lightning and does not yet have a roadmap for Lightning support (to my knowledge).

We will see a steady stream of these surveys, with similar conclusion/results over the coming months.
* crypto is real and will be massive
* crypto = Bitcoin
This awareness is spreading to normie business leaders. "Blockchain" is no longer a shiny object and alts are seen for what they are and the conclusion that bitcoin is it is spreading.

Very cool. Thanks for sharing.
Love the smiles everyone has when a vendor &amp; customer both say yes to Bitcoin.

Digital ads replaced by microtransactions paid by end-users as they browse.

Coinomi will be fine.
Congrats on being at the forefront and helping increase Bitcoin adoption. Let us know how it goes.

I don't see how that will not happen. Micropayments via LN will permeate everything. 
The only reason many things don't have end-user micropayment charges now is because it has not been practical, due to price and transaction time. But LN makes it practical.

I think usually you can scan the vendor's wallet address with your phone wallet app and then on your phone specify how much to send and then click send.
Highly recommend wallet is samouri:

Mass bitcoinization happens not from everyone buying bitcoin, but from everyone *receiving* bitcoin.

You sound as asinine as most bcash supporters. It is like a magnet for assholes.

8 months ago Novo was in prime position to do big things in crypto - no one was better positioned - and he blew it by falling for Brian Armstrong's and Roger Ver's altcoinage quackery.
Now instead of epic gains he is facing another era of historic losses. Poor judgment.

* Square is the main investor in Lightning Labs iirc.
* Square CTO said recently of Jack the CEO, "Jack is all in on Bitcoin"
Perhaps before the end of this year, Bitcoin via Lightning option on Square POS terminals.

1,000 years from now, when people ask, "who made bitcoin?", Pieter will be in the first class, along with Satoshi, Hal Finney, and few others.

Andreas needs to do a pilgrimage to Mecca, spreading his message along the way, and make a documentary of it.

lol what a stretch.
His authority comes from his reputation, not from any control he has over the system.
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:49:11
This is a bfd. Peter has been brutally honest about his experiences with LN and the previous failures he experienced. So for him to now say he is now seeing this as a success...that holds a lot of validity, authority, influence.

ahh my bad jesse. misread that. I was fending off bcashers at the time and had them on my brain.
