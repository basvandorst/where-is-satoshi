I think it's very debatable, whether you can call digital currencies a "pyramid scheme" and also a slight overreaction to announce to never buy anything from e-tailers and retailers that offer bitcoin as one of many payment methods.

We apologise for all the emotion this 2€ fee is evoking and we'll discuss it again in the future, thanks to all the feedback we collected. The fee is however supposed to cover several additional costs in accounting and for the implementation of the payment method itself, which is not as simple as one might assume.
The 10.000$ package and the subsequent ~7.500€ limit *IS* in place because of security reasons, so there is nothing dishonest about it, we just don't want to explain unnecessary details about the BitPay background, that would bloat the FAQ, cause it's unimportant for the overwhelming majority of our customers. As I already said, if we feel more secure with Bitcoin as a whole, we will increase the daily payment limit.

But we are listed on Geizhals of course and we are providing lots of product pictures to the site. Here you can see our customer feedback (which is very good)

What's confusing about the marketplace fee? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:10:14
For now, this is an arbitrary sum set for mere security reasons. We will increase it in the future, if things go well enough.

But we do exactly that:
"For a start, common computer processors (CPUs) basically have the ability to dig up new Bitcoins, yet these can only calculate few (kilo-)hashes per second and are therefore ill-suited for mining in relation to the electricity consumed and time spent during the process. With regard to efficiency, they are being outclassed considerably by graphics processors (GPUs), whereby current graphics chips of AMD’s Radeon series in particular have proven themselves to be exceedingly powerful. Nevertheless, those are again outperformed by ASICs, specifically developed for that purpose and accordingly expensive, which currently show the highest efficiency at Bitcoin mining."

The Caseking Group consists of Caseking.de and Overclockers.co.uk along with several smaller offices in France, Poland, Taiwan and the Netherlands and arrives at a combined annual revenue of about 100 million Euros with about 160 employees in the UK and Germany.

Sorry about that. On the Caseking.de website and FAQ (also on Overclockers.co.uk) we are calling it "virtual medium of exchange" along with "digital currency".

Aaah my bad ;)

Thank you for your feedback regarding the fee. We are currently still trying to tread lightly on this and intend to do this step by step. I took up your complaints about the additional fee and we are going to discuss it during our next assessment of how Bitcoin works for us in a while.

Of course we can converse openly here, that's not a problem. Bitcoin is still something new to us and in an experimental stage and we are always keen on improving just about everything. Did you read our whole FAQ section (in German or English) or just the overview page? The former is supposed to function like an introduction and explanation on some level, but of course would never be able to replace the need for additional research in a Wiki. 
So we are explaining market places and their fees like this: "The various marketplaces of the Bitcoin network, that are being used to carry out the transactions, in general demand a fee for each transaction, on which Caseking has no influence whatsoever."  
What is there left to add, without enhancing everything beyond our intended scope? As far as I know, there is no real standard regarding the amount of the marketplace fee, so a conservative (=higher) number is just better, to be on the safe side and we deliberately don't want to put in any exact numbers, cause every Bitcoin user will know the marketplace fee for the marketplace he/she is using anyhow and of course they only have to add that particular amount. I also believe that it's quite clear, who gets the fee: the marketplace. ^^ So how would you call it instead?
If customers do not add the marketplace fee manually, the whole order will be "underpaid" and subsequently it won't work. Thing is, that this fee is not indicated on our order summary page (which is the legally relevant thing) and therefore we have to warn customers, that there is something coming "on top" of that sum. So the emphasis does also not lie in the word "add", but rather in the word "manually".
Can you name what we didn't understand and give any examples on how we "interchange words" and "somehow throw all infos in a bag and then put it together blind[ly]"? 
Thanks! Und du kannst auch gerne auf Deutsch antworten ;)

Hm nein, ist nach wie vor alles vorhanden.
