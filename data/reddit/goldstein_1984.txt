I didn't have any orders. I had +btc, i just bought 30wdc (exactly that) and still had positive balance. After a few hours i logon, and i have a negative balance. So they took also the little btc that was left lol.
This is crazy, or am i missing something here?

Nah, i didn''t meant my order disappeared, but on the knc site itself, the mercury miner disappeared!
But i still have hope to get delivery in october!

yeah, i woke up: BOOM increase of 46.02%. I could mine exactly 2 days on my merc on the old diff. I might just look into buying a freaking 200 watt solar panel or something, but it isn't exactly sunny here and i have rental with only balcony. Need cheap electricity, so wind turbines or something?

So this was the order:
2013-12-18 17:37:16	Buy	0.00051885	30.00000000	0.01556550
30 wdc bought.
I had like 0.009 btc left (nothing i know, but its principles right?)
After i logon again for a while and have a negative btc balance. Multiple cryptsy support calls, but they don't anwser
edit: 
BTW, this post gets downvoted or upvoted, i don't care. Facts are facts. I bought no other coins. Just the transaction for 30 wdc, from +/- 0.16 total balance, to -0.01 balance. So i bought them for more then 0.17 btc.
edit2: btw, i have seen with my own eyes that the when i logged out, i had 0.009~ btc left. And after i came back its minus 0.01~

I have exactly the same problem
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:49:53
the thing is, i got nothing double. i had 1500 wdc and bought 30. No i have 1530 wdc.
