And you could make your own design. Just search for "tag cloud generator" in Google and choose one. Then feed it with some text, configure it however you like and voila.

Whitepapers are not religious texts. Why BCH people are pushing so hard for dogmatic "interpretation" of scientific facts? All scientific propositions have certain areas of applicability. Network with 100 users and network with 100M users cannot be governed by exactly the same set of rules. It's like intranet vs Internet. Imagine the global Internet without all its upper layers and working merely on the Ethernet/IP layer. You can't build a house by just raising its foundation. You have to build walls, windows, doors, roof, etc.

Yea, the idea of big blocks is equivalent to using the same voltage in your house as that coming out of the powerplants. Let us all use 500 kV for our toasters and coffee machines! The power transformers are evil middlemen! /s

Hey, I would be happy and proud to contribute some native Android development. Lightning is really interesting to me.

They whole idea of big blocks is moronic. Like building 8-lane highway to every single 5-hut village in the world.

The moment a formal leader is "elected" or "promoted" or assigned or whatever you call it then EVERYTHING will go downhill and burn to the ground. I've been in such a non-formal community. Human psychology rules everything including currencies.

So, basically, the "central" authority now is the local LN hub as the middle man. What's the substantial benefit of this vs current banks? There will be monthly and yearly taxes for settlement as the on-chain transaction fee will be times higher than now. The same situation is now with the Internet Providers - end users pay monthly for a shared access to a very expensive backbone network. In the Bitcoin world the blockchain is this backbone. Do I understand LN correctly?

Where are the microtransactions stored actually? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:55:30
Maybe for a small fraction. But for the entirety they have to use not one but a several of the largest exchanges. Man, that's $3B.

Lol, you're far behind in the bidding... 
:D The utter non-sense never cease to amaze!

Increased Demand is the real thing. We've seen it here in Bulgaria with the plastic bags pollution. Plastic bags became so cheap that people started using for everything. As there're very few recycling plants the result was - pollution everywhere. Then the government decided to put a tax on each piece. So, they are expensive again. There's no free dinner. Bigblockers will learn it the hard way.
