I believe the rules are roughly the same: two lowest brackets are taxed at 0%, top bracket at 20%, the rest at 15%.  The tricky part is that you LTCG rate is determined by taxable income + LTCGs.  For 2017 I think the 15% bracket is $37.5k individual, so if you had $35k of taxable income and $100k LTCGs, you would have to pay 15% on most of that LTCG.

You can’t “invite” or “uninvite” the government. They’ll do what they want. And generally the government is more effective at deterring and punishing theft than community efforts.
But back to the point at hand: blacklisting is a bad precedent. It’s effective changing the definition of what is a bitcoin (or whatever else). If we blacklist the gox coins and no one accepts them as bitcoins, then they are effectively not bitcoins. A second theft of bitcoin (voiding the gox coins) can’t make up for the first theft, and could harm unknowing consumers who bought them. All bitcoins are equal valid.

I still disagree.  On-chain transactions cannot scale the size of Visa without becoming as centralized as Visa.  Second-layer solutions will have centralization, and one the LN you'll have to tie up your bitcoin.  Sounds pretty much like a bitcoin bank (not that that's the worst thing ever).

Ethereum isn't the store of value that Bitcoin is. Attractive qualities of Bitcoin are limited supply and consistent, predictable code. Ethereum can do a lot more but that requires more complexity =&gt; more potential bugs =&gt; not as good a store of value.

What part is factually incorrect? That the "pops" didn't actually happen?
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:15:20
Specifically, I'm thinking of the ETH fork and the relative lack of decentralization.  The fork showed that the developers are willing to rollback "bad" "accidental" trades.  The fate of Ethereum is tied strongly to Vitalik, and that itself introduces risk.
Both of these make ETH less like gold.  LTC and others already has BTC beat at being good for everyday spending (not considering acceptance, just features of the currency).  BTC's niche is being a store of value that is resilient to interference from government or other outside influences.

If I sent $1M and payed 52 cents the transaction fee would .000052%, even though the network did the same amount of work as a $43 transaction.  That's why percent is a terrible way to look at this.  All else equal, it doesn't take double the resources to send double the value.  Price per byte is the best metric.  But the price per byte is still too high for transactions with lots of inputs.
If the minimum on-chain transaction fee we can reach is order of 10c, I'm fine with that.  On-chain bitcoin payments will never dominate the small transaction space.

They occur because those networks have so little hash power. You can “cheaply” rent out enough hash power to 51% attack them. 6 isn’t a magic number of confirmations, so if a malicious actor gains a huge percentage of the hash power they can double spend even after &gt;6 confirmations.

First, the mining subsidy won't last forever, and eventually fees will have to be the main source of mining revenue.
Second, it's not about miners getting some compensation, it's about miners *maximizing* their compensation.  Any miner should act rationally and maximize their profits.  On the surface, it *appears* that a miner doesn't suffer a loss by including a 0-fee transaction in an otherwise empty block.  But a miner **does** suffer a relative loss by including a 0-fee transaction in an otherwise empty block because it doesn't force users to pay a fee that the miners could collect.

You get the fee back and it goes back to the original wallet. In the eyes of the block chain, your attempted transaction never happened. As to how long: I’m not sure, but I don’t think that much longer. IDK the exact dynamics of how it works. Maybe someone with more knowledge could provide a better answer?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:23:30
Paying off the debt completely would be a terrible thing because then the Fed couldn't do monetary policy, which is actually useful.  And there's no need to balance the budget.  We can run (smaller than current) deficits every year and keep real debt/GDP constant or even decrease, as long as we keep growing GDP.  As long as we can always make the interest payments, and these interest payments don't eat up too much of the budget, the system works fine.
**Now**, following those policies will erode the value of USD.  That's okay.  BTC crushes USD as store of value.  But a well-managed USD does a pretty good job for "typical, day-to-day" economic transactions.

I don’t know how it will effect prices in the short or medium term. In the long term I think it’s great, as long as Bitcoin doesn’t fuck itself up. Futures will allow for a more mature market to be developed, and options can be built on top of futures. All of this will help the market accurately find the true market price.
The market price of any global, large, mature asset will be driven by Wall Street. If bitcoin is the new gold then I don’t see any problem with volume from big banks driving the price. That’s just how global finance works.

Not true in the US. Crypto to crypto trades make you realize gains/losses. You have to mark the trade at “fair market price”. So if you traded BTC to XMR, you have to consider that you sold your BTC for cash at going market rate and then bought the XMR with all that money.
EDIT: I don’t know if this is fair or not, but that’s what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:21:55
Futures have some technical differences than buying "physical" bitcoin, but those technical differences have little actual effect.  It's close enough that for the purpose of effecting the price, you can effectively consider buying a future the same a buying a bitcoin.
What a future does do is allow you to "own" "bitcoin" without having to worry about protecting your private keys or dealing with crypto exchanges.  This will allow many more investors to get exposure bitcoin.  Every futures trade needs someone to go short and someone to go long, so for every winner there will be a loser.  But futures will expand who is in the market, and then this new market (old hodlers + new Wall Street) will collectively determine market price.

I think Coinbase is fine but they did open their BCH market in an extremely unprofessional way. The proper way to open a market is announce that it will open in 12/24/48 hours and in the mean time people can place limit orders. This fills up the order books before opening.
What Coinbase did is open the market instantly with no orders on the books. This fails to discover true price and leads to wild swings. They had to shut the market down almost immediately.

I think this is generally okay. The whole point of a fee market is competition between users to get into a block, and for miners to maximize profit. One way miners can effect prices is by changing the supply (changing blocksize). Another way is to institute a price floor. They lose immediate profits, but could profit more overall if they convince users to pay higher fees.

Mempool size doesn’t matter, only sum of unconfirmed fees matter. I could send 100 GB of 0 sat/B transactions but that doesn’t mean anything. They aren’t meaningful transactions because I’m not willing to pay anything to have them confirmed.
Unconfirmed fees matter because it shows that’s users want to buy a spot in the block but have been priced out, and those transactions could be confirmed with larger blocks. But IMO miners should never pick up 0-fee transactions even if there is room.

Cloud mining could exist as not a scam, but it's almost always either a scam or way overpriced. It's about economies of scale. It's much cheaper to set up one mine with 1000 miners than it is to set up 1000 mines each with one miner. The problem is that I need a bunch of capital to set up one big mine with 1000 miners. Selling shares can get me the upfront capital that I need.
In order to work, cloud mining needs to be run more like a public company. Instead of buying a fixed X TH/s for $Y, you would a fixed X% of all the profit the mine produces. When the mine makes profits it can either reinvest into more mining hardware, or pay dividends to the shareholders.

That's one effect of trading OTC, but if the OTC trades are large enough then they will effect market prices. If BTC is trading at $5k OTC and $4k on markets, either OTC prices will be driven down or market prices will be driven up; in both cases due to arbitrage.
Another reason to use OTC instead of markets could be lower fees. If you trade $1B on CoinbasePro, someone is paying $2.5M in fees. An OTC trade could be set up for a lower fee than that.
