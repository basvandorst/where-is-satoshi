You're making assumptions and putting words in my mouth. Nothing you said has anything to do with my story. I'm not telling people to do anything, im not telling people to invest, I'm not telling people to give away anything. I'm simply sharing a story about how Bitcoin has given me the power to help others. Yes I am very fortunate for early adoption. You want to spin this story how you want to be my guest but you're completely wrong.

Hey I'm really sorry to hear about your father. I'm happy that you are able to help your mother. Keep your head up and keep hodling, who knows what we can do in the future.

It's the core software opensourced on GitHub. You should Google it and do some more research. I don't mean that to be rude I just think you could learn a lot.

It's worked like this for a while now. Mycelium supports paying these tx's, (I know I know they suck) but maybe some more wallets should upgrade software to also allow people to pay these types of tx's, Bitpay sucks but it's not all on them.

One of the worst Parts about this is if you pay a merchant who uses coinbase* Merchant tools and your transaction is not confirmed within the 15 minutes of allocated time they give you it resets the invoice and then the transaction that did not go through in the 15 minutes of time will be confirmed and sent anyways. They will issue you a refund but it is sent to your coinbase wallet, not an external wallet (even if paid from external wallet). 
As a person who has never used coinbase and only sign up for an account this is absolutely ridiculous to me. I have three refunded transactions in my coinbase account right now and I refuse to give them my identity or cash out in fiat. 
At this point I consider this theft.
*Not sure what the downvotes for. There are two options here. Provide your identity with Id or provide identity with bank account. Coinbase merchant tool is a trap. 
** Coinbase merchant tools not bitcoin merchant tool
