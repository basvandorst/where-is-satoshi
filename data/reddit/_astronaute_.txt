Lira of course, I'm still hodling :) Everyone was making fun of me but look at me now! Just look at my low losses!
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:39:04
Turkish Lira is doing better then Bitcoin since January. I should buy some. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:23:09
I think that the majority of investors at that time where around 60 yes. But regardless, the important part is that 68 years went by since 1950. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:15:26
If you were 60 years old back then, it brings us to 128. 
 
Let's say you were 30 year old, it brings us to 98. Very bullish indeed. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:50:13
In 2018, holding Turkish Lira was definitely a better investment than Bitcoin. That's a fact. 
 
We will see at the end of this year if Bitcoin recovers or not. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:25:13
And you'd be 128 years old too.

Making a guide for a complicated process doesn't make it any simpler.

I will answer your question on December 31st.

Silk road don't need Bitcoin anymore... Montero took that place a long time ago. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:51:24
It feels same "inside" internet
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:19:02
If Bitcoin + LN had 1/100 of Visa transactions, the fees would be $1M per tx. 
  
Let's wait few years for Bitcoin to be able to absorb enough transactions instead of pushing it into the abyss. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:18:56
TA doesn't work, it has been proven scientifically that it is not better then dice rolling basically. 
 
You may feel that it works, but that's just your brain tricking you. No one can predict the future. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:18:02
Well, one could easily  argue that LN is just a tool for blockstream to generate revenue. 
 
Long term Bitcoin supporter here but I don't like where this is going. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:33:59
"People like me"? Argument hard to counter, good job. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:22:58
By your logic, in 2019 it will be around -275÷
Gains are over it seems. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:44:14
Can you at least admit that more transactions are done offchain means less money for miners and more for those running LN nodes?
It's a "yes" or "no" type of question. 
 
See how people are downvoting me? What is the reason in your opinion? Did I insult someone? Was I spreading lies? I did none of those things and yet, I feel I might very well be silenced. 
 
Man, I miss the Bitcoin community from before Blockstream for so many reasons. We were abke to discuss things and have diverging opinions. Blockstream is not a charity organisation, of course they will favour their profit over everything else, everything. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:55:30
We are far from low lol
I'm waiting the prefork price
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:10:05
Try asking about Blockstream's business model. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:05:31
Mate, you are the one who seems ignorant. The BTC is in free fall, if you think this is the bottom  you're free to buy. Just don't pull others with you and be the reason they've lost their money. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:20:08
More returns for them less for us. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:52:15
And you can fork it at will. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:22:31
Anything that ultimately generates profit for Blockstream. They are in it for the money of course. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:22:30
Who controls the police in your utopian version?
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:16:39
Some people are not allowed to buy weapons for good reasons and comparing knives and guns is not very smart. A lot of things can be used as weapon, but guns are the most efficient at it. 
 
I don't consider libertarians as very smart anyway. Try to imagine a perfect libertarian world, a state without taxes and all benefits we enjoy each day. It would be Free For All deathmatch mode.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:35:38
As long as you remain in those secluded small communities of like minded people with the traditional society supplying most of what you need, no harm done. I'm talking about applying it to the whole planet. It doesn't take a lot of thinking imho to see where this can go. It would be exactly like Mad Max lol thank you for the reference :)
 
Of course I would love to live in a fair environment ruled by fair government but the human nature will never let us have it. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:34:33
You are maybe not aware, please educate yourself on the business model of blockstream and where the money from LN will go. 
 
They basically move gains from miners to LN and blockstream. This is the model being implemented currently. It doesn't benefit miners despite the fact they are securing the whole network. 
 
I would like to be proven wrong instead of being silently downvoted. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:40:28
Guns are more efficient at killing even though you can find anecdotal evidence of killing multiple children with knives. If I have to chose between a madman with a knife or a madman with a gun, Ill take the one with a knife. Anyone who sells them illegally should be severely punished. Those who have to buy guns illegally should not have access to them because they are not fit to have them in their possession. 
 
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:06:24
Bitcoin currently is only a store of value, that's what I usually read on this sub anyways. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:20:19
I didn't say that at all. 
 
Ah I see your logic. That which is lawful is automatically unjust. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:31:33
And all the child pornography being sold as well as weapon sold to criminals. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:33:53
It's still evidence, no one should defend people facilitating child pornography and selling weapons to criminals. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:05:01
Also a reminder, LN is not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:26:11
Their position is that crypto cannot succeed because of that specialised hardware requirement. I told them that other serious crypto projects allow GPUs to mine (Monero). 
 
So now they don't understand why Bitcoin doesn't allow GPUs to mine it (by being ASIC resistant). And honestly I don't know either. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:06:02
*cough* current bitcoin implementation is not in sync with the original white paper *cough*
  
It would be great if someone could write a new white paper for the current bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:13:06
No Bitcoin is transferred until it is written on the one and only Bitcoin blockchain. LN is of no interest to me. I want news about Bitcoin getting better. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:37:25
Downvote all you want but Bitcoin is not ready for another bullrun in its current state. The capacity is still an issue, even with LN which is far from being ready for mass adoption. 
  
Some people never learn from past mistakes. If $50 fees become an issue again we can all say goodbye to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:44:33
Being ASIC resistant prevents anyone from making specialized hardware as it becomes too expensive to keep up with the algorithm changes right? Or are you saying that ASIC resistance cannot be achieved?
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:34:19
It will be as common as cash once the cash disappear.

Safety doesn't exist.

I agree. For me it's like a credit card. 
Once someone figure out how to pay contactless using a phone and crypto I'll be happy.

He said that owning one bitcoin will be equivalent of being millionaire.
That means that if 18 million people hold 1 bitcoin worth 1 million, there would be 18 millions of millionaires in Bitcoin alone. 
 
The total market cap of Bitcoin would be 18M x 1M = 18 000 000 000 000 USD (18 Trillions).
 
That's just not realistic.
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:39:29
Nope, it got rejected today. All ETF will be rejected for same reasons, Bitcoin is not ready for ETF as there is too many frauds and price manipulations going on. Cherry on the top, most of the trading doesn't happen on US exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:24:02
I'm saying that if they approve CBOE request, they will directly contradict themselves: 
 
"The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges.
The bid-ask spreads varied widely across exchanges, the SEC said. The volume in bitcoin futures markets are small: 20 percent the volume of platinum, and 2.5 percent that of silver."
 
The same still apply for all ETF requests.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:12:52
Another DPOS crap, this time with Bitcoin flavor.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:33:01
Once everyone realise the decision with regards to ETF could take up to 240 days, there is a good chance we'll see Bitcoin under 6K. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:17:52
It just went from $0.0000001 to $0.0000002 a year !!
 
Fat gainz
Stupid post talking about meaningless percentage. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:11:38
They cannot approve any ETFs as the underlying reason for the rejection will not change. It applies to all ETF requests.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:28:59
Doesn't sound like you understand how project promises works. 
They promise a lot and don't deliver. They are very good at taking people's money during the sale though, I give them credit for shilling the shit out of their garbage. The fact is, currently they are DPOS with their crappy "federation" of "notaries". 
 
Until they deliver what they promised, they will remain inscribed on the crap ledger.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:21:36
There will never be 21 millions of millionaires.
 
If you really think that number of millionaires will be increased that much thanks to bitcoin,  I suggest you learn more about economics.
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:19:23
Same reasons can and will be applied to any ETF request:
 
"The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges.
The bid-ask spreads varied widely across exchanges, the SEC said. The volume in bitcoin futures markets are small: 20 percent the volume of platinum, and 2.5 percent that of silver."

The thing is, the past is easier to read then the future. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:12:58
This is just an old trick to get masses to buy BTC before the "pump". Once they buy in, whales are going to dump it hard as usual. 
 
And then, we are going to get a lot of "hodl" memes and the cycle is completed. 
 
Crypto is always fun to watch and sometimes so predictable :)
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:38:00
Of course it will be rejected, for same reasons they rejected this one. Too much manipulation and fraud.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:33:12
Just because you are not aware of the money being raised, doesn't mean it is not being done. I know for a fact they raised money. It shows the level of information you are on.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:29:51
Lol, misleading and pretty much fake news.
 
It is just an intermediary service accepting Bitcoin.
