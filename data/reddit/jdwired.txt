Yes, trying to work out where supply and demand curves collide hard.  I am saying processing supply may become fundamentally inelastic, followed by power supply.  If coin prices keep going up as they are demand is already inelastic  
Working through the most likely path and timing of how things will play out is worth thinking about.  It's how to make $$.

Yes I agree.  However as the block chains get more and more popular and price increases encourage more and more mining we will hit limits.
When limits are hit interesting things happen.  Limits come surprisingly quick in exponential growth. 
Pays to think about what those limits will be and how may profit from them.
If difficulty is throttled back because of issues adding to processing capacity while coin price continue to soar would do interesting things.
The chip manufacturers will sell as many chips as can build at a superior margin.
The miners who had gear would recieve more fiat payout while others wanting to mine waited for their chips and would be paying a big premium for them when they recieved.  Current miners would be able to use gear that would be otherwise out dated.
Interesting and we will see soon how it plays out.  If coin prices collapse or stop growing any such speculations will not come to pass.  If they do continue things will get interesting.

I understand it and yes there is a correlation between capacity and work pitched at the blockchain and difficulty.  The coin release determined is a set rate and is adjusted by increasing difficulty to match the increasing effort put at it.
If increases in effort at block chains slow because of limited manufacturing capacity expansion of the computing capacity put at it - that changes things off the course to date.  Hardware that has gone obsolete in a year might last two or three years.  Big difference in a mining revenue forecast.

Renewable is poor for mining because it is not available 24/7; except for hydro.  Mining increases base load which makes adoption of renewable even more problematic.

No it's not.  The battery backup is too expensive.  Work some numbers and you'll see this too.  Other than pumped water there is no economic electric storage solutions in the market.  Euan Mearns covers this very well multiple times on his site Energy Matters; worth reading.

Global warming caused by man is not good science but more akin a weird religious cult fueled by taxpayers money.  
They don't need more money to create the most expensive and unreliable electricity on the planet lol.
Do some correlations of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere vs man's carbon emissions and you'll find there is no correlation.   Like when emissions cut nearly in half after 1978 ans didn't recover for a decade - the change in rate of co2 accumulation did not change.  Or why has the rate not changed from 1958 to today despite co2 emissions up like 10 fold?  Really basic stuff that is not explained.

Is that a pic from the future?  I didn't know it had hit that high.....

And when they are not the miners will keep mining.
Their rigs are depreciating really quickly they cannot afford to turn off when renewables not making power.
So base load of power consumption will increase and that will come from fossil fuels.
Not wanting to rain on any parades; just being realistic.  Work through a business plan of mining and an engineering analysis of the power system you'll come to same conclusion.

Yeah I read their white paper.  Their ICO will go.
Not sure how anyone will bitcoin mine with solar - shut down the mine at night?
Practically no one will mine with renewable needs a base load.

Massive power outage, perhaps from a solar flare or EMP attack

Bitcoin and Facebook are both social networks.  As is fiat currency.  Different functions but without the social agreement to use, none would have any value.
So depending on the social network that develops - or mania - the bubble could go much much higher.
