"So he can't support financially those who want to preserve "traditional marriage" that his faith recognizes as legitimate?"
What are you getting at by starting your rhetorical question with "he can't"? He certainly can, and did. You seem to think that freedom of speech (and in this case, the freedom to spend money) means freedom from consequences. This is a child-like misunderstanding of what freedom of speech means.
"I bet there are tons of tech executives who donate to the Democratic party, a party that supports abortion, which is against the Brave CEO's faith and basically viewed as murder. So he has to just bend over, grab ankle, and take it?"
No, and literally nobody is saying that. Where are you getting this from? Your hyperbole isn't helpful. It makes you sound kind of simple-minded, in all honesty. Anyone is free to be outraged by donations to the Democratic Party. Just as anyone is free to be outraged when the head of an organization supports and funds efforts to enforce his personal morality on the rest of us. It merely protects him from government persecution.
He's the one spending money to violate the rights of others and you keep pretending he's the victim. Freedom of speech means he can say whatever he wants, without government interference. It doesn't impose an obligation on me or anyone else to accept his views, and it certainly doesn't grant him immunity from the consequences of expressing those views in the public sphere.
tl;dr - you are trolling.

"It's not like some revelation that most people think marriage makes sense between penis and vagina people. The real mystery is why marriage should make any sense for penis in butt people or vagina vagina people."
Wtf...
