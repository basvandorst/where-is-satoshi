yeah how about the thousand retweets from family ? how about you guys go in depth and SEARCH for the info go for it  and see the FRIENDS and FAMILY pictures and everything they are SHARING to show support, instead of asking me to go through loops in holes while my lil sister is dying? donate if you want, I'm done trying to "prove" to people this is real, it is real feel free to see all the mourning Ocala,FL is going through.  Come down and see it yourself, I have been trying to be positive but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH from the bitcoin community you guys are the ONLY hardasses in the crypto community everyone has been loving and supportive while you guys sit there DEBATING as someone dies.
Donate if you want, I'm done trying to convince bitcoin

still waiting for someone to point me the right way, I've gone through hell this week idgaf what you really say I have bigger issues at hand than to worry about your opinion. So put the subject aside and direct me in the correct way. Please

how am I full of shit? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:25:49
Believe what you will, don't donate that is fine. But please put that aside if that is the case and just keep her in your thoughts and prayers. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:29:46
How about you help direct me the correct way instead of being a dick, considering I'm trying to help raise funds for my family?
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:06:25
I'm working to get this all set up correctly, please bare with us we are only into day 3 of the situation
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:23:42
I updated the cover picture of my fb, which where the picture was uploaded you are more than welcome to request me as a friend and keep track of the situation and funds same with my twitter.
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:17:06
If you look and see, You'll find post from friends and people that knew her. Carwash pictures. The proof is there, you just don't want to look for it.

The video will have to wait, Doctors have asked for the family to come in... It is crucial that she wakes up today guys. I would love for you guys donate to the family but ultimately please keep her in your prayers and thoughts. It is crucial that she wakes up today.... I'm seeking desperately for any help from any source possible to help her out. But from the news I just recently received, Prayers &amp; thoughts, positive vibes, whatever you may believe in please send that energy towards her.

I need help doing this, I can't post anything on that thread
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:11:41

Thank you

not that it matters but you guys are the only community with the LEAST donations. I'm sick of seeing Bitcoin reminding me of the popular kids at school. PICKING on these other currencies, yet which communities are being sefless?

Video from her friend 
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:48:46
not yet, this only the 3rd day all expensive have been gas/hotel/food expenses for her parents to stay in town. She is in a hospital 45 minutes from where we all live. I'm trying to remain positive and that's what is needed right now.  I just received some critical news that has cause the verification/proof video from the family to be halted. If you do not feel comfortable donation, I completely understand that. However PLEASE keep her in your thoughts and prayers.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:59:07
Just remember which side you stood by during these times.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:09:28
I'm completely new to this and we are desperately seeking help to cover the medical expenses. I've reached out my community of fellow musicians/producers to a music EP via bandcamp and as well as the Dogecoin community since I'm just now getting into crypto currencies. We had a user wanting to help via bitcoin so we decided to expand it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:49:24
they haven't been able to control her pressure the last couple minutes they have to stop her heart to try to get it to go down. Please Send Your Prayers And Vibes we will need them today more than anything....
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:53:26
I honestly have never used reddit until I was asked to by people who recommended it as a source to reach out to the community. We've made a Video, We've done everything Bitcoin has asked from us. There are people willing to donate, they just needed reassurance. The news picked up on what I was doing over twitter and even then so I promoted the bitcoin name proudly, even though you guys have been one of the harshest of communities towards what we are trying to do. I thought that finally having the news article, would help our cause.... I can see your a dick and a smart-ass and tbh I'm the same way, so I get it. But please, understand that this is something delicate,serious and important too me. Poke your fun make fun of me but please remember that this is bigger than you and I right now. This was a freak accident, and it can happen to anyone really. So behind your computer screen make fun of me all you want talk shit. But in real life take a moment and spend it with a close loved one. Because I regret every opportunity missed to spend time with her.
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:17:20
yes... thank you so much. Words can't even begin to describe how grateful we are.

I was asked multiple times by this community for "proof" there it is.
