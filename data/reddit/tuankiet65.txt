And there was somebody said that she should do something more related to science in Science Festival rather than Bitcoin.

I know that, this address is used to "burn" bitcoins

The miner who mines the block with this tx will be a millionaire.

OK, understand now

Nah, when you click on a picture or link that links to "bitcoin:[Somebody address here]", the browser tells Multibit to fill the send address to the above address so you can send some bitcoin to that.

First people mined with CPU, that was the only way at that time.
Then people found that GPU mine a lot faster than CPU, so people bought a lot of GPU and built a rig and mined.
Then FPGA appeared. FPGA is a chip that can be coded to do specific tasks (here is Bitcoin mining). Althrought it didn't mine faster than GPU, it comsume less power.
The final and last generation of mining hardware is ASIC. ASIC (Application-specific Integrated Circuit) is chip that can only do 1 thing: mining Bitcoin. Because of that, it has 2 awesome features: eat less power and mine faster. So everyone buys it and it's the reason why the diff is 4 billion now.
Unfortunately there is no technology that can beat ASIC now, so if the diff increases, there is one thing you can do, that is buy a better design ASIC and hope to get some cash before the diff increases again and your rig is pissed off

If you want to make money, you MUST buy ASIC or you will get nothing with FPGA or GPU.

51% attack is when someone has &gt;50% of the hashing power, not public nodes.
