Congrats on the purchase. I’m just waiting for my bitcoins to clear then I’ll be storing mine cold as well.

I don’t see either on app store? IOS problems?

Can I just store on Trezor? Where else can I store? What are my options?

Can you not transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:41:17
Thanks a lot! Can you have both? Or is it a one thing or the other kind of situation?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:21
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:11:35
Ah yes of course, thanks!

I have a BOA account, I would like to try and buy with my MasterCard to get 2% cash back and just pay it off right away. How do I then transfer the bitcoins account to my mycelium account? Thanks! And sorry I’m new to this...

I have a galaxy tablet and an iphone lol. No PC. Will trezor support pc? For future reference...
