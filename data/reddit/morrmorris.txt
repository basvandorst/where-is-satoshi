This hurts so much, a lot of bitcoins are lost, I hope there'll be way to bring them back to clients.

Yes it's possible, but it costs a lot and I don't think that free electricity will help that much
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:20:33
Why is this happening? What causes that? More info please
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:26:45
It's too small amount that you want to purchase so probably half of it will be fee.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:29:34
So it happened, time will show how it will affect on market.
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:18:41

This is hilarious, shame on you Donald
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:37:11
Yes you can, beside coinbase, there are other services that will not ask you for you personal information so you can try with them.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:24:22

@_date: 2016-04-19 17:10:45
I really like this part "Bitcoin Could Change How the Internet Works"
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:19:07
I use OpenBazaar for a while and have no problems like this.
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:30:29
Congrats, keep on with the great work.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:56:35
Congrats on your release, I'm using mycelium so far, but I;ll give it try with this too.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:38:25

@_date: 2016-04-19 17:42:02
Well, this sounds interesting, jackpot you are mine!
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:28:56
Thanks for info, really nice explanation, so others services should learn from this.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:33:47
It's them, and they are aware of the problem, fix will come soon.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:27:22
Yes it's possible, I believe even more.
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:26:30

I feel happy for you, thanks for sharing that info, spend them wise.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:40:30
It a great idea, but like other inventions, I'm pretty sure it will be find a way to hack that too.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:32:08
I don't think there's such a tool so far, but keep you bitcoins, it's safer that way, i don't see you will gain much if lend it.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:10:00
Nice approach on things, yes this is promising and could be key point in future
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:19:44

Again, great talk by Andreas as usual
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:46:57
 give it a try with this.
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:32:45
"The email did not specify the reasons for the exchange to close, but it said that all user funds must be withdrawn by June 30, 2016." too bad. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:43:16
Probably it's multibit wallet but older version, give it a try with that.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:14:11
What is a LN transaction?
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:24:52
Core is basic and best option for you.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:18:01
