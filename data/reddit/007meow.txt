The guy that OP cited, who has proven to be a reliable source (or as reliable as you can be), thinks bitcoin will go from the $11k it’s currently at to $100-400k? 
Am I understanding that correctly?

What has he estimates that Bitcoin will peak in 2018 at?
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:06:59
What is FUD?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:45:57
I’ve seen estimates from “knowledgeable” people estimating bitcoin going anywhere from
$40k to $100k by the end of 2018. 
What do you personally think it’ll end up at?
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:42:37
I could see that happening when bitcoin was valued lower - going from $400 to $4000, for example. 
But going up to like $400k now just seems crazy to me.

By that, do you mean that it's not a good idea to just leave my purchased bitcoins in Coinbase?
I should move them into a wallet?

Ah yes, the next thing that is millennials are ruining. Reddit comments.

I love them to death, but their insurance rates just aren’t competitive. For me, at least.

How valuable are currencies that are extremely volatile?

The problem is we haven’t seen any growth this year. It crashed from ATH and has been around 6.4-6.8k for months. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 03:42:10
Remember when people kept saying BTC will hit up to $100k by the end of 2018, or at least $20k?
Good times. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:58:21
Last December we were at 18k.
We're currently at 6.4k.
We would have to more than triple in value in the next 2 months to reach 20k. Given how BTC has been doing since last December, I *highly* doubt that's probable.

Paul Ryan is the guy who said “no leaks, that’s how you know we’re a family” in leaked audio where he and other GOP congressmen were joking about Putin paying Trump and Rohrbacher, so.

I wouldn’t be surprised if crypto *tanked* now. 
This is an inherent vulnerability of crypto, and why I feel that we’ll never see it truly take off - too high of a potential for the anonymity to be abused by criminals.

Is there an easy guide to do so for someone that didn’t even understand a 1/3 of the terms in your post?
I’m way too amateur at this.

$65k, 0.25 BTC. 
Bought a good chunk near ATH, so I’m down about 50% of my investment. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:15:56
I have 0.25 BTC sitting in Coinbase. 
I’ve heard that’s relatively unsafe? Should I move it somewhere?
