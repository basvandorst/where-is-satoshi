You know why?  because most people don't understand tax law hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:37:49
Think of BTC as gold, you don't make daily purchases with gold.  You invest in gold, and casually extract the wealth generated from your investments by converting it to another form of currency.  The high transaction fee's should be an indicator of, "hey I should probably be keeping my transactions to a minimum in order to preserve my investment."  Think of it as gold, and you will understand why BTC is better if viewed as a "long term investment." 
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:19:32
Yes, because they will have to pay capital gains taxes on not only the pump n dump strategy.  But also their value exchange in BTC when they trade it back.  Atleast, this is how I read the current tax laws.  Which of course are still being written.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:56:34
I am no expert, but assuming they are not verifying every purchase (aka over drafting occurs because they assume your account has the funds) this would likely mean they are unable to process at any faster rate.  Again comparing BTC to, say, Visa.  You realize the large job they are working with.  Computing massive amounts of transactions every second, in all corners of the globe.  All going through their holding house(s), and then back out to the respective account  and routing   Essentially "FDIC" insured means nothing more than, "we got you, until you don't have the funds."  Kind of why it takes "ACH" transactions so long to clear, and credit card transactions can go instantly.  Because it puts off the timing.  (again not an expert, so I am likely off on a few points).
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:21:10
I'd say less time than that.

Let's solve a math problem.
Which is easier to solve, trick question.  When you need SPEED and EFFICIENCY for authentication, you need to make sure the information is verified.  By solving 4 individual 1.0 difficulty problems - this is the same as solving 2 individual 2.0 difficulty problems.  The advantage I see (in theory) of not implementing Segwit is that you can now send those 4 individual problems to 4 individual problem solvers.  With Segwit you would need to have 2 problem solvers have 2x the computing power - to achieve the same result. *(again a very generalized version of the problem).

An actual constructive suggestion!  Interesting!

Just imagine how the fools invested in shitcoins will feel when they deal with capital gains taxes in about a year :D
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:39:43
I suppose either or might be the situation.  But, we have no idea what the % rate will be.  How they will calculate it, and what the penalties will be for under reporting your gains.  So, therefore I'd rather work on long-term gains - versus alt-coin gambles (which are basically all pump n dump games, not really investing).
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:21:15
Don't forget about the capital gains tax...
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:45:18
Aaaand its gone.  Jk, they will play out for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:26:01
The difference between OT and digital currency is you earn OT.  Capital gains will be taxed HEAVY because its investing - not labor.  Also, when you transfer in and out of the non-alt coin's you will be taxed on the gains of all outside trades &amp; and the gains off the BTC (example).  So by the end of it, you will have already likely spent the money, or have it held up in some other crypto, which you will then need to withdraw - take another tax on - and continue the viscous cycle.  AKA, if you have a lot of $$$ in crypto, go hire a tax adviser or read up online.

Maybe instead of fighting on Reddit, you could have posted all the positives and negatives of Segwit.  Because obviously there are two sides to this discussion, something I need to learn more about, to be honest.

Coinbase or Gemini.
Gemini is not very user friendly, haven’t had a problem with Coinbase.

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:13:07
They are slowly passing legislation across the country.  By 2018 roles around, I would predict that Gemini will be the flagstaff and all other exchanges will be miles behind in terms of regulation / government oversight.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:14:16
Forks are unprofessional.  You want a fork, invest in a equally successful currency and hedge bet against the two.  AKA Ether and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:43:02
The idea was to eventually use Bitcoin as the currency.  Not just to invest and then return back to Faux Dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:40:48
I think this is how valuation has always worked.  If you don't like the way someone plays the game, quit and go play somewhere else.  My prediction is that Gemini will never add another currency purely because there is enough going on between Bitcoin and Ether to keep IT support busy on their Exchange - let alone 2 other Altcoins.
Edit* grammar
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:12:02
This is done in order to control market volatility.  They want to see digital currencies exchanged for years to come.  Not bubble burst before 2018 even starts... apparently like Coinbase would like to see in terms of supporting so many anti-BTC campaigns... Such as launching the very "opposition" of BTC... Bcash.

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:07:59
Those are all problems that exist upon all other exchanges.  Gemini is the only creditable source in terms of a fair shake.  They will become the standard in Crypto.  Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:06:59
Nope, just joined Reddit in order to voice my voice.  Online banks such as Capital One need to be reevaluated in terms of being treated under the fair banking act (they are not allowing them to have full rights to wire transfers and bank transfers).  I have read this information online, now.  All of a sudden, this was not in place prior to my decision to bank with Capital One, invest in their platform, or even decide to invest in Cryptocurrencies.  Which are 100% legit, and are being positioned in a way to prevent access to a market - which is not something that should happen anywhere in the world.  Especially in free market society - like the one we all live in currently.
I suggest everyone contact Capital One and inform them that they would appreciate their participation in local and federal matters.  This has become a bit of a issue - but it is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of market manipulation perpetrated by our current financial institutions.
Please /bump thanks Internet.

If you had a credit report pulled on you (aka opening a credit card or any other method that typically pulls your credit) while also having your money in limbo, because it takes your bank 5-7 days to clear a "simple" ACH transaction it will block your service if you didn't have the funds directly in your account at the precise moment you went to withdraw it on Coinbase.  AKA if you knew your paycheck was coming in 3 days and it said 4-5 days to clear, you needed the money in your account preemptively.  That is, if you were getting your credit ran, because they were accessing your "risk" value, and right now the current *propaganda* is saying people are maxing credit cards, and mortgaging their homes.
They want to control the markets, but they are terrible at controlling what they already posses.  So they make off the cuff decisions.  Bank local, these big name banks are scared.  Don't let them control your currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:56
They are under scrutiny of the SEC and FDIC.  They cannot manipulate markets like Coinbase and the creators/hedgers of Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:09:44
Gemini only represents Bitcoin and Ether.  I could see them backing new security digital currencies (soon to come) but at this time they understand what the market needs.  Some freaking stability.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:28
Consistently, this is why I only use Gemini for trades.  And Coinbase for market watching / holding longterm investments.

Fuck coinbase
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:22:58
Their 401k’s, hedge fund portfolios, and people nor institutions figured the world would take the future of digital assets so seriously.
But just remember where it all started when uncertainty comes with volatility in the near future.
Adoption leads to volume which leads to volatility.  Which means profit to early adopters.  Yes, this is still the early adopters phase.

The same should be said at the end of each “it’s gonna crash soon” - There is a I’m a master analyst - saying it crashed haha I’m right,
And then I’m a master analyst so in my opinion, things have changed.
It’s either gonna go up forever or never be this high again ��I don’t care which one is, either way I’m in.

Wouldn’t it be in the best interest for everyone else who does/doesn’t have tons of USD - to literally stop using, and convert to something like DAI; and make it the new global currency (DAI @ TimeOfSale converts to USD.  Remainder is “acorn invested” into ETH - the store of value for DAI). A new backed currency within a crypto currency system - that branches out and values 65-95 percent of the market at any given time.  Cuz of course you also bullion ETH with the value of BTC - like the good ole days of 2017.
Because artificially one USD and DAI for example will = the same store of value if kept regulated and both available at auction block and micro transactional alternating volume cliffs; like the global forex markets are manipulated x the value backed (bullion/gold) ETH market.  Which IMO has a consist trend for long term market growth and sustainable energy. (Multiplied by the news and tampering of federally serviced USA debt receipts.  Or formally known as the American Dollar).
Both are imperfect, because store of value is often misguided by fueled / pumped / dumped — perceived value, so in the long run - one system will fuck with prices/interest rates - another could offer sustainable growth and/or merely decentralized power of a global resource (I.e. currency/bullion) - so no one man could have all that power :meme: 
Simplified thought.
USD - DAI - ETH - BTC &lt;EOS&gt;
Store majority of wealth in DAI, use DAI for USD purchases and convert the “acorn invested” residuals into ETH.  Which at times has a very lateral moving average + spontaneous swings in value in direct relation to BTC.  So you can store “ wealth bets” against the slow moving changes in wealth between this interlaced relationship.  
Perhaps all within the EOS network so that the running costs and long term transactional fees would remain as uninvolved as possible.  And it would just remain a big ��to the idea of a currency not being backed by other stores of value - not corporations and armies.
It would be like the US economy backing up the German economy. And because the US knew that the British economy could step in and help because they had the Chinese economy who was there to step up and help, just in case Germany over extended to much help to China.  That’s essentially how we are treating crypto/currency right now.  And it’s a little heart breaking, but certainly not permanent.
Once we realize globalization has already happened and it’s not an agenda, it’s reality. I think our society will find a new era of thought. Based upon observational analysis of constructs &amp; the rebuilt; philosophers stone oracle story chapter book ending - right before we essentially enter the times of dramatic global warming and very motivated and modern redesign of other global institutions and ultimately financial markets.
So pretty much everyone wins unless you make a lot of USD and literally never invest it anywhere.  Which we all know doesn’t actually work that way.  9/10 of every dollar is fictitious play money that can be lent out. That would be like buying BTC and getting to borrow out 9 BTC to other people while only storing 1 BTC in your wallet for those people to access.  Basically not your Keys.

For future adoption I predict x4 for a while, and then x3, x2, etc...

I respect this comment. 
We have the to think of crypto as more than just about money.  We are a community.  When the future comes around and we think about how we used to rely on institutions to store value for us, instead of using technology to connect us.  I believe the first stepping stone in the right direction will come from clashes; like these, that eventually remind us the true purpose of BTC.
Fuck the Banks.  Go try to withdraw any money, and see it within 10min.  This technology is purposefully volatile, to remind us how stupid the banking system is.  And how much more sense BTC still is today.  Imagine if we all centered under a couple of the top giants; and also toppled a few of them. Decentralized the funds for community based resources (aka endowment for all).
When you buy something, the bank buys it for you and then covers the tab by taking your money that you stored with them to pay for it.
We could be more powerful than banks, gov, etc., very quickly.  2020 BTC RUN BANK RUN.
And also buy some precious metals after everything peaks again here soon.  The stock market is basically a crypto game when you realize people use their investment accounts to pay for their electric bill.  Ok boomers, I see you with your monopoly board.  Flip it upside down guys.  Take all your cash out of the system - see what happens.  Your institution will try everything they can to stop you.
Do it anyways.
