Pick me pick me ಠᴗಠ

Yup, just got that now.  Well, congrats!! (had that 2hJ... out of the website a while ago. Fumbled at 1-yard line :)

the hex version of 2hJZoD5CEfo1FhVr6FKvqtoEdFFGPP8Ay4xBqA2xsNUW is da1259a03e4211fa3516156be852afaada047451463cff00cb8c41a80db1b0d516 , not what you have in your .png?

I caught the 'o' and messaged during the game. Just compared to my solution and I have the capital X too! Guess that's the 4th dimension: depends what time you did the contest.

please clarify:
so back to brainwallet, throw it in as the private key, hit compressed, grab the uncompressed private key
(i was doing this hours ago, still isn't working for me..)

Sure, count me in

I used notespace/cscott and wrote my own "KEYSPACE". (Just because I didn't want to spend time trying combinations without my extra character. Each character is 23^3 x 4) Will get changetip figured out next - this is my next challenge, which should hopefully be easier )

I'll let you do the big reveal It was a bit of a scramble after I cracked it because I started thinking how much it would suck if I finally got it, and somebody else did too (unlikely, I know) but was faster than me at the import/transfer. Then when I saw a couple of confirmations, there was some serious celebration (and I'm still smiling now). Thanks again - it was a lot of fun following the development of this challenge and I learned a lot I wouldn't have without it.

As ghetto as this sounds, I kept my 'new character' set to 4 characters at a time (like I would do say -?%$ , then revisit after). The reason I did this was because I thought the only way I'd get it was by understanding the hints, himself and some luck - not just a blanket scan over UTF-8.  My computer is pretty dated too, so I was worried it'd light on fire ;). (It actually just shut off a couple of times due to heat until I cleaned out a massive ball of dust/lint from the fan, and I had to re-run some characters). I should probably consider using the reward towards a new laptop the more I read over my replies, but I don't have a lot of btc, so I figure I'll hang onto it because I think bitcoin in general will be huge! This is a great start.

As 1 extra note: I almost felt creepy I spent so much time reading everything you've ever posted on reddit looking for clues. I feel like I know you at this point probably better than I should hah. Like I said in another reply, I even started googling for types of bulldogs (e.g. 'olde'), unicode dog symbols, ...  Is there a stalker badge/trophy I should be expecting in reddit?

I did the same picking 3 from the revealed set, plus 1 extra, but the extra I added I hand-picked based on some guesswork. Lots of luck involved. My hardware wasn't too good and I was only able to get through roughly 45 characters in 2-3 days. Definitely tried some from en keyboard (approx. 25)
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:54:17
I started when the hint first came out 16 days ago, ran a few characters I thought it'd be, then gave up that same day. Then my OCD kicked in 2-3 days back and I tried again. (My cpu was pretty active over that 2-3 days). Part of my challenge was I started on a Core 2 Duo (pretty old linux laptop), then for the last few days moved to my quad core laptop which made it a little more tolerable, but not much hah.

The hints were helpful definitely. I did pick up on &lt;3, but my failing was thinking it was literally '&lt;'. Tried this v* early (around 5th/6th character). When I took to eyeballing unicode characters, I couldn't resist the open/black heart actually because of the initial attempt at a heart with &lt;3.
@_date: 2015-03-13 05:53:38
Got it.. Thank you !
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:21:43
Don't forget just tacking it onto the character set at the beginning still has you trying all the combinations tried before (without your heart). You want to use 3 characters from the original, plus the heart present always. I didn't use the keyspace source code that was there already and wrote some that would do X..., .X.., ..X., ...X where the . came from the clue and the X was my new character. It's 23^3 x 4 per character (48k).
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:21:55
On my quad-core laptop, I think each character took me 30 minutes or so. On the Core 2 Duo I started with, ~ 2 hours.

It feels like 2 groups of users are being blurred into 1 here.. There are the Evolution users, which their UX consists of Evo's design, and the site developers/designers, which their UX (if you want to call it that) consists of Bitcoin APIs, technology, etc.
Evo's UX that let them control large amounts of BTC wasn't well designed from the perspective of their users. That said, it was very well designed from their perspective if their end goal was running off with everything they could get. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this was your point: how could users support/fall for Evo's UX?
From the developers/Bitcoin/Bitcoin APIs/technology side of things, there is definitely still room for improvement (and a lot of education required). However, do you blame email as a technology because you can phish/con/spam users over it? Over time, smarter email clients have been developed that filter spam and try to identify phishing, as well as users have been better educated. I expect the same will happen with the Bitcoin ecosystem.

With a straight-up scan, I'd be right with you. The characters I used were chosen largely based off of the comments/clues that gave. (Specifically "memorable", some hints dropped re: native language, ...)  Funny one: I tried to scan the unicode 'dog' and 'dog face' because of his nick and love of bulldogs (? ) even.

Bithalo might be of interest to you if you haven't seen that one yet

Early on I scanned '&lt;' thinking he combined it with the 3 for a heart, then got really fixed on the word 'bits', spelt with the circled s at the end.  I tried a bunch of t's figuring it was unicode b, 1, some t, circled s. (E.g. the circled large/small t, the t displayed for some other currency on the bitcoin symbol wiki). There were a couple other wild guesses in the middle, but I went back to looking over the unicode table for likely candidates (manually) and when I saw hearts again, thinking back to &lt;3 I gave the open heart &amp; black heart a try. there is a 'fat heart'. I know you probably love bitcoin that much too but thank you for not using it!

pop in here so I can tip you $5 (no reply on the original thread; went through the process of loading some bits into changetip so I can send you some)
