Okay, tell me what makes it so special?
Besides being backed by some community that's willing to pay their hard earned money for some virtual coins.
That's the only advantage bitcoin have now from other cryptocurrencies, the biggest community. 
I bet that if most of the community would proclaimed Bitcoin Cash as a real Bitcoin or even BSV lol, then you would be praising BCH or BSV.
Because code is open source, then you can even create bitcoin by yourself. In fact there's a lot of versions of bitcoin that I couldn't even count.

I haven't read more bullshit than this in a long time.

Evolves into global hard money? How's that? 
Bitcoin in current shape isn't a better solution, than banking technology currently available. Every major change to protocol can split the chain and community. Currently is being developed second layer protocol (lighting network) , but that's only because it's need to be done, just to make this project to survive. Technology behind the bitcoin may be considered impressive 10 yrs ago, but now you have a lot of competition from financial startups and other crypto space companies.
What major economic problem is solving bitcoin that it should succeeded?
That's only virtual currency used by a small group of people, nothing more than that.

I exactly know what Bitcoin is. You just another BTC maximalist blinded by your greediness.

Bitcoin is just virtual currency and there's still high risk that it become worthless.
Central bank could create their own bitcoin, instead buying it from the market, it's open source after all.
Destroying its own economy, just to buy some virtual money isn't much clever, right?
