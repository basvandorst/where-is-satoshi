When trading on Binance, is there any way to completely trade all of a certain coin?  For example, it only shows trades to 3 or 4 decimal places (can't remember for sure), and forever leaves you with a very small balance in everything you trade - between the 4th and 8th decimal place.  Is there any way to get rid of those small balances, or are you forever losing out because of the rounding?

No it won't even let me click send. Also tried refreshing it like you say.

How do the candle graphs work on GDAX, when the components are: high, low, open, and close?  If the market is open 24/7 what are they using for open and close, especially in the 15 minute intervals?

How do I zero out a Bitcoin Cash wallet on Coinbase?  I want to transfer it all to another wallet so I have 0.000000 BCH, but when I say "send max" it says I don't have enough.  Transaction fees are zero, so why cant I send it all?  I have to keep decreasing by a penny until it says ok, but that way there will always be a microscopic amount left over.

Can't find it, not sure if I have the right one. Can you post a link?

GDAX certainly wants a lot of very personal info and my drivers license. It's that a safe /good idea? Why do they need all that?

Ah, makes sense. Thanks.

I'm looking to get into bitcoin as a type of piggy bank.  I'd like to have it so that I could periodically deposit between $10 to $500, just to dump in money as I have some extra.  I'll do all the reading and research of course, but could someone just say I need to sign up for x, y, and z and use x method.  And I'll read up from there.  Thanks.

I signed up for Coinbase to buy, and set up a recurring weekly purchase from my linked checking account.  The first purchase went through, but is the price paid the price of BTC at the instant the order was placed?  The receipt says it make take 8 days to receive the coins.  In other words, is the market price at the instant the order is placed locked in, or is it the price 8 days from now?
Also, why is the price paid as listed on the receipt higher than the price that their ticker quoted at any time?  In other words, what I paid was an all-time high that hasn't been reached yet.

Thanks - would you say not to worry about hardcore security until I get a balance of over $1,000?  In other words, just use the Coinbase account until then?
