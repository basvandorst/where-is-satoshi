want me to spoon feed you? google it yourself. you don't know anything about tax on investments. you said you pay tax on bitcoin every time you make a sale - it's gotta be a total b/s.

After the discussion, I decided to sell and buy back my coins. This way my 1099, if gets issued in 2018, will show a smaller amount of gain. After the discussion I think it's just a matter of time until Coinbase/GDAX starts to issue 1099. I maybe charged with transaction fees, but I think it's worthwhile pre-preemptive move to sell/buy back now. Thanks for the great discussion to all.

Thanks a lot! What I'm making the best out of it is that each withdrawal and deposit over 10k matters most.  For the holding, since the exchange doesn't know what's in your wallet and just like you pointed out that the value fluctuates so rapidly on bitcoin - I think it's has to be a less of a factor.

I think LA Times is definite that S. Korea is banning anonymous trading.

I like XRP but I think there is some truth in your argument.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:11:21
I think this is the reason for today's big swing.  South Korea is to ban anonymous bitcoin trading.

$500 minimum to hand-over identity/tax info sounds about the same same as mandatory 1099.. looks like golden years are over.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:08:36
I know. I'm just trying to decide if I need to do any tax planning in last two remaining days in 2017 because I'm concerned 1099 may become mandatory in 2018.

I think my last (3rd) bullet point is moot because I'm sure it takes more than just trading in foreign exchange in order to qualify for earning money overseas.

Are you including all bitcoins in your 2017 tax return? Are people really doing it?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:52:13
You are suppose to pay tax every time you make an exchange at a gain regardless it's BTC to ETH or LTC not just BTC to USD.

Provided we know how these Whales swim, everyone should play the same game - piggy back riding on the whales.  See the pattern they play and follow.

There is additional 6% or something you have to pay on investments due to Obamacare.  So, the long term rate becomes like 21% (15+6) and the short term rate becomes like up to 41% (35+6).  What tax rate did you pay if you really paid tax on your bitcoins every year?
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:14:35
I agree that they been just giving the ramp-up time to the exchanges. There is no reason they will treat coin exchanges any different from stock exchanges where you get 1099 for any amount of gain or loss.

Wow, you know a lot about these topics. Do you know it's 10k for each withdrawal or 10k in proceed or gain for each sale that the coin exchanges are currently required to hand over the information?

Do we also pay that 'investment tax' on bitcoin as well?  I guess that's why it's 40% tax on the day trade?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:45:00
I think this is the reason for today's plunge.
Don't panic yet. There is a resistance at 13500 with 224 buy orders. Hope it will stand.

Sales tax or something similar to VAT on bitcoin is such as horrendous idea.. Not sure if I will trade on U.S. coin exchanges anymore after that..

Not sure S. Korea has capital gain tax..  Either way, S. Korea is a whale not a fly. It's a herd of whales.

I bought it around $3000 in July. If I sell at 20k in 2018 and pay 40% in tax- with all that investment tax things being added. That's like 7k in just tax.. I can't complain since I still made money, but 40% tax rate is a bit too high.

So, are you doing it yourself? I'm yet to see a person who is actually doing it. Neither I'm yet to see a person who follows every tax rules - things like unpaid sales taxes on things you purchased from other states. I never seen people doing that voluntary.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:25:47
Do you pay that 'investment tax' on top of capital gain as well?

I hope Trump administration doesn't tough the crypto, but I'm afraid there is a big chance they might. It's on the headline everyday.

If you don't know Investment Tax, I'm not sure if you ever paid tax on bitcoin anymore.

Guys, do you think Ripple will over take bitcoin as its current pace?
