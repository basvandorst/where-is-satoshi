Doubtful the US is going to ban bitcoin.  As an aside, They’ll make plenty off of taxes on capital gains anyways.
Risky investment? Fair enough.  In my opinion, it’s long term potential presents a passive investment opportunity of a lifetime.

If the US bans crypto, all other nations not banning crypto will continue to see their value increase, leaving the USA behind.  It would take a global alliance of countries simultaneously banning bitcoin to contain it... and that might not even work to cease it completely, just slow down the inevitable.  
Do you really think the all of the nations would unite to ban it? China and US and Russia and the European nations?  Doubtful.   Whoever doesn’t embrace it will be left behind, and those who do embrace will reap the benefits.

First I referred to this
The text/stock ticker I used was “BTCUSD”.
When initially opening spreadsheet, it will automatically pull the stock price.
To refresh current value in my excel (2016) , under the “Data” tab (in top toolbar) is an “refresh/refresh all” button.  Tap that to update.
I’m assuming there are some macros out there to auto update periodically but haven’t looked into it.
