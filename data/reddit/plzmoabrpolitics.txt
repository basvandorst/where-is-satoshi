It's actually cognitive dissonance.

purse.io is a scam and there's been hundreds of posts acknowledging this.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:24:49
Great sales pitch, see how many people want to use a currency with $2 (and rising daily) transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:48:37
I believe they call them bag holders.

The way purse.io works is a victim like yourself orders an item from Amazon and sends purse.io bitcoin.  Purse.io sends your order out to its network of credit card fraudsters who then use a stolen credit card to buy your Amazon item.  Purse.io sends that person in bitcoin.  Essentially it's a method for criminals to turn stolen credit cards into real money.  You then receive your stolen merchandise (if you're lucky) and get a little visit from the police because your item was purchased with a stolen credit card.
How do you think they offer such discounts, cause they are nice people?

When bitcoin XT/classic/unlimited nodes skyrocketed did you also think it was a false flag then or did you blame the other side for cheating?
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:36:10
Lmao yes let me know how that works out for you in a couple years when the price is 500 again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:18:10
Lol "accredited business" I literally loled.  That's hilarious.  I guess the weekly "purse.io stole my money" posts are all fake news right?  I suppose the guy who had his house raided by the police for using purse.io is fake news?
Lol you guys crack me up, you couldn't spot a scammer if the person literally told you he was going to steal from you.

The only thing funny is in real life the girls are running and you are chasing.

It's always been embarrassing.  Even if you raise the block size, the problem just gets pushed off.  It doesn't matter if bitcoin has 1mb 2mb 20mb or 100mb blocks.  Bitcoin will never be a real competitor to Visa or Paypal because of this.

It's almost as if a payment processor who built a company around low fees is going to go out of business if fees remain high.  I'm sure they're the only ones though, everything is fine!

Only if your an economist with a PhD.  But if you got your economics degree from Youtube like a bitcoiner, then no.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:09:17
According to the devs and mods here, bitcoin is not a currency either.  It's a settlement network.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:02:53
So bitcoin is in such a state that "spam" as you call it, can essentially make bitcoin unusable for everyone else via high fees?  All the businesses and people who can't afford current transactions because of "spam" now suffer because blocks are full?

Has Reddit made these non public?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:33:13
Oh look yet another account that has been hibernating for months or years comes out of the woodwork to give a generic one line comment in support of UASF.  What a totally organic movement you guys have here.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:50:57
Wow an online poll brigaded by bitcoiners shows the public would want bitcoin over traditional stocks.  Surely the moon is near!
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:59:04
That's funny cause the core team and the moderators of this sub chastised bitcoin XT, bitcoin classic, and bitcoin unlimited for doing the exact same thing.  Can't wait for the official statement from them letting us know why it's actually now OK to do that.  Just like how 3 months ago clients that significantly alter the bitcoin protocol without consensus were the worst thing ever, now they're the greatest.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:58:53
So much for decentralization.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:42:25
Yes and when bitcoin XT nodes skyrocketed you guys blamed for cheating.  Now that BIP 148 nodes are sky rocketing, you're still magically blaming DELUSIONAL

The transaction fee of the second donation is more than the donation itself.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:02:58
Literally every thread about scaling talks about Jihan. So much of this decentralized system appears to rely on one person.
Weird!  It's almost as if the "decentralization" buzzword is about as honest as the "micro payment", "fast transaction", and "cheap transaction" buzzwords.
One by one bitcoin talking points for why we should use bitcoin seem to fall apart.

LOL could the astro turf be more obvious?  Gimme a break.

So in order to secure the money of the future you need to get hacked first and incur massive losses?  Makes sense, where do I sign up?
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:40:27
So bitcoin is just like a mini banking cartel with a handful of powerful companies controlling things?
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:48:30


Boy that's ironic for a UASF supporter huh?
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:21:12


People who can afford a $1,000 conference are the ones who have the most stake in bitcoin.  The most stake in its success.  If only 3% of those people support UASF, that tells you all you need to know.  UASF is an astro turf campaign promoted by shit tier memes on sock puppet accounts.
