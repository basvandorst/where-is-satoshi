Is that for just bitcoin, or all 3? I had to wait 6 confirmations to deposit PPC on Friday?

I can safely say, I do not receive any financial benefits from any of the companies I have listed in this thread, or in my comments. So no. I am not endorsing VaultOfSatoshi as my main choice. I have provided a few other examples. You are also welcome to check [these guys out]( as well. I think they are fine establishments. I heard mixed opinions about CanadianBitcoins but that could just be heresay.

No, anyone is free to use virtex. Just don't expect much in the way of service. There are times where I use Virtex too; reluctantly. But no worries, just bringing other exchanges to light. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:34:26
+1 Very good
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:44:38
for new clients only? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:33:56
That sucks, yeah I heard about that. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:33:33
Can't wait to see it sky rocket. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:16:53
Typically I will perform all the trades I most possibly can, and then cash out after garnering all the profits made. Having other exchanges at my disposal is convenient too, so I can make use of daily limits anywhere. But that's part of the logistics of day trading. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:16:19
Not gonna lie, they've screwed me over several times in the past. Haven't disclosed them here for fear of being identified by them.. And of course they have my personal info
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:23:44
Depends where you are, if you're in Ontario (Toronto) they have a store called 'bitcoin decentral' on 70 Spadina Ave. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:28:26
Not sure as I haven't used them myself. All I know is they don't require ID. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:04:16
Props for that. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:54:04
They could use faster confirmations, I agree with you. Their 100 coin limit applies to what, litecoin? PPC? or all? I haven't encountered that yet. Did you verify?
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:59:03
I've had an account at virtex since the end of 2011. The issues I'm talking about have crept up within the last 6-8 months. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:57:37
Personally I haven't any issues with them. I get the USD funds from Vault Of Satoshi to my Canadian USD Chequing account with BMO. Once the fiat arrives, I change it to Canadian. So there's no real difference, since I'm reporting the gains in Canadian after conversion. 
Edit: To convert the USD into CAD, I do it with the BMO online banking. It's pretty convenient imo. No real trouble there. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:35:13
It's not too terrible of an option to deal with virtex, but the point of the post is to present the fact that there are other exchanges available, other than virtex. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:21:18
Thats strange, because on VaultOfSatoshi, I did over 400 PPC today. That would explain the orders of 99.99. But I've seen other orders at about ... 1450 PPC or 500 PPC .. so not sure why you've hit some time of limit. Try to call them. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:35:46
Have you tried calling them? .. that is.. if they have people to answer?
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:16:08
Over 60% mined, and you're saying we're in the 'early' days. Good game. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:07:13
If you missed it, my point is, there are other options that Canadians should be made aware of. Period. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:56:46
I couldn't agree more. Try calling Joseph now: 1-888-812-2525 - You just get some pissed off sounding guy who wants nothing to do with you other than you fees. 
Anyway, I vented my frustrations about virtex. Nobody is perfect, but they can most certainly improve on a lot of vital things.. in the mean time, there are a few other canadian exchanges I am presenting to everyone here to show that there are options. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:13:11


I've heard some mixed reviews about CanadianBitcoins. But yeah, the other ones are good. Bitcoiniacs are behind CoinTrader.net too. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:06:00
Yes, you're right, in the description I provided it says that it's bitcoin only as seen [here]( 
When I said [this]( I meant all exchanges I mentioned combined. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:25:36
If you buy, it's 1.5%, and if you later decide to sell, its yet another 1.5% totaling to 3% (for a complete round), and vice versa. Used to be 3% to buy, and 3% to sell, total of 6% for a complete round. Imagine that. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:34:14
It's a nice exchange imo. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:58:08
No proxies were needed, the account is still local. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:35:50
You're welcome =)
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:17:38
should be buying ... all the time. LOL jussayin'
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:28:27
I wanna try it. Make sure it's available in canada.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:09:12
Mission accomplished. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:27:34
Yes, and yes. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 04:48:18
It's up there for anyone who missed it I suppose. I see lots of reposts on Reddit for the same very reason. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:10:25
This is about depositing my friend. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:27:51
See last screenshot. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:30:07
I'm not sure because I have a hard time reading chinese and need to have it translated. 
Sample of their orderbook: 
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:19:42
You figure a Reddit username registered 4 days ago by the name Luka_Magnotta would have already been registered by now such that someone in the future 25 years from now wouldn't be able to use that name, or remember who Luka Magnotta is. Just saying.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:34:06
It's not a foreign account though. It's a normal chequing account with online banking. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:28:38
I think it's well within context. Crappy customer service. Underwhelming performance. I'd say it's pretty relevant. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:15:24
Thanks for pointing it out, upvote for your original post! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:20:41
I signed in with QQ. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:40:50
I heard that too, but you know what? With China, anything could happen literally at any time. This ban could be on major exchanges so the government could ponder on how to deal with the currency in the mean time, you know? So perhaps once they figure what to do, they may resume things like normal. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:20:58
I made the account *in* china. Signing in through a canadian ISP doesn't change the type of account I have. That's like you going to China, signing into your canadian bank account... and it suddenly turning into a foreign account because you're overseas. Doesn't work like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:43:04
I'm gonna attempt to deposit CNY and buy BTC... with screenshots. Updating soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:49:37
You'll never know until virtex hires more than 9 employees. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:37:02
If you're feeling risky, you could always leverage. I borrowed $1000 from the bank to make $300 back in 2010. After that, I returned the $1000, and worked on that $300. $80,000 later, I didn't regret it. Getting over the fact that I was on the hook for $1000 was a bit nerve wrecking though. Good luck. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:11:44
I like this point. I like this point a lot. [14 year old facial reaction]( 
But yeah, I wish I could have done this back when I was 14. Damn. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:51:19
Probably a bad idea to utilize a brain wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:37:06
Well, my friend is chinese, and I now owe them a beer. Lol! That's the simple explanation. 
Long one involves me being in china, having opened an account while I was there during that time. Don't really wanna get into those details; so the first explanation works just fine! haha
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:27:54
Oh no worries! I was in china when I made the account, so it still has my old details. =P
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:35:36
Well I can't explain the situation going on over in china. All I know is that this exchange makes it possible for people to deposit CNY. The ban is related to banks and third party payment processors. Maybe the ban is being reconsidered, not sure. Either way, the end user won't be punished if a company isn't complying. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:31:42


Lol!!!! We have a winner!!! So yeah, no, that dude is Japanese.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:28:53
Posting a video would require extensive video editing as my personal details are available when logging into the exchange, which I would like to hide, not to mention the time it would take to edit. So no vid unfortunately. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:19:04
I don't think that everyone *just* figured it out that the Chinese government can simply choose whatever it wants to do, and change it's mind whenever... take Russia (a [democratic]( country) suddenly becoming "anti gay" right before the olympics in sochi. Point is, any government is like that my friend, not just china. Not tryin to defend them, just pointing that out. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:45:22
Lol.. well good to know. The bank account I opened was not with bank of china. I used one of their other banks, still major, but only in china. I guess you could say that my account is no different than any other chinese person's account. Standard chequing account with online banking, no minimum balance, no fees.. etc. 
Thanks for the appreciation!! All I can say to the promise of a crash is... keep buying.. no matter what, and eventually things will play out in your favour. Time is the ultimate essence.
