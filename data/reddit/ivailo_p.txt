Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:39:38
Can you, please, elaborate on that? A simple version and links would be perfect. Thanks

How close is the future society to the **Biblical** prediction for the end of the world ... not being able to buy/sell unless having the mark of the beast (and how it connects to the bitcoin, face recognition, any pgisical/virtual trackers and what not new tech)? Thanks

I like this simple explanation. In short... Bitcoin will be in less trouble than the rest of the financial world?

Especially the second point. So, why does not everybody, who like Bitcoin, start working on creating a very SIMPLE 2-3 sentences that explain the advantage of bitcoin and start spreading it - sone people will believe it, some will research it... But somehow this needs to be coordinated - can ordinary people do that?

Hahaha... Good one!

I keep forgetting it is an open source software! This should be emphasized more frequently!
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:13:41
That is so true! So then... How can it be made more convenient? The banks, I guess, will die to become the middle man and to continue staying in the  game
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:41:05
True... But it is hard to voice that to people who are against Bitcoin.

There is one guy - he is smart but old... for him everything is conspiracy... Bitcoin had been created by US government to control us and to be the next scheme to get our money. It is difficult to say anything against such a simple and wrong argument. What should I say in response - should be another simple thought that can penetrate his thick skull with simple logic?
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:05:00
Oh wow I am going to definitely use that one!
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:46:25
Hi, I want to learn... Can you, please, point to good source? Thanks 
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:42:53
The video is good... But most people will not 'waste' true time watching a video. They want to be convinced with... just ONE SENTENCE...
@_date: 2019-02-09 02:41:59
Thank you for that point of view ! Unfortunately for me, it is getting even more confusing ... I want to believe but  ...
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:28:59
Can you elaborate a little bit more why you think it will stay at 1k and later goes to virtually zero? Thanks
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:04:19
I really appreciate your response! To me it sounds very realistic! Thanks
