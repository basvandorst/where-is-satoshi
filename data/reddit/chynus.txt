the repost finds you!

Just to be clear, I know how Bitcoin work and how I get them.
It was just a small (sarcastic) reminder to don't tip every stranger in this sub with one post or a account created 30 min. before.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:28:49
Hi, and thanks for the giveaway
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:36:23
Thanks alot.
@_date: 2014-12-31 10:35:30
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:35:51
Thank you very much for the tip I really appreciate it but no need to tip me.
P.S. I guess I know the basics I'm into bitcoin since 2012 :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:47:18
You don't get it, if I google it or read the FAQ I get no tips.  
Thats not how it works! /s
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:36:37
I second this, use [Changetip]( would be perfect for this.

I want the movie "Coinado"!!! 
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:07:17
Sounds good.
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:48:36
You can torrent the blockchain that goes a lot faster. [**Link**](
@_date: 2015-05-01 02:54:12
I'm ok with the testnet version address really not that mutch hassle. I copy paste the address anyway so not mutch difference. 
 
From my other post:  


With that everybody should be happy :)  
...but after reading the most comments I highly recommend to add a QR-Code in the near future too ;)
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:11:57
You could try [bitbandit.eu]( (Slot machine) but with this high stakes you would probably play 5+years, lol  
[Some info](

If you're living in Germany you can grab a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B for 34.90€ at [ebay](
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:13:07
It works with chrome on android. Just go to  **  and **not**

Edit: Wow seems to be working, thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:35:18
Yes, no first hand experience with the re-release but it should be back:  
[reddit:Mycelium is back in the iOS app store](
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:06:09
May the pw is incorrect? Maybe you need to use the Bitcoin-Qt password if you dump your keys to electrum?
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:17:27
You can watch your address and confirmation here:  [**blockchain.info**](  
just copy + paste your address there
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:24:35
Ohh didn't know that, thanks for the info too.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:18:35
Mycelium is android only anyway for iOS I think breadwallet is a good choise.

Just set up a fullnode and read a little bit about mining.  
You will quite fast come to the point that mining is in no way worth any hassle.  
(Except you want to plan a mining farm ;)  )
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:45:36
You are not the owner of the Bitcoin, so it's anyones fold but not yours that you lose the Bitcoins. /s  
  
Dunno, but maybe the people think it's safer cause they don't trust there Computerskills?
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:03:29
Just [choose one](  
I prefer Electrum (especially for software-wallet newbies) but thats up to you.
@_date: 2015-05-04 06:04:15
Of course, but if you want to mine just to learn you can do that just with your GPU or a cheap "USB Bitcoin Miner" (Just look at ebay). But be prepared to earn next to nothing.

I have and the only thread before is the "stickied post".    
Didn't found any newsarticle, sry
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:37:28
Ok, didn't knew that thanks for the info/clarification.
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:02:04
Second this, but want to add Mycelium is available for iOS too. 
Edit: Spelling 
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:53:32
Keep in mind that the seeds restore no imported keys, iirc!  
If so, my plan would be dump them in electrum make another new wallet with elecrum and then transfer the bitcoin to it.  
You can import your donation keys after that but take care of your privatkey.
Edit: Grammar/Spelling
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:26:14
Ha Ha, good luck with that ;)
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:17:07
Bitcoins via PayPal is the fastest way to get scammed, just saying.
@_date: 2015-08-31 11:33:35
Congrats to the ~~winner~~ winners!
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:55:11
If you have a money-transmitter-license then it should no problem.

Or use a one year for free VPN  [**OkayFreedom One Year for Free Promo**]( :)  
Edit:    Without any ads, or limits(?) and any other bullshit  
Edit II: Unfortunately they don't support Bitcoin as payment option yet. Feel free to drop them a message  
at **support and ask for the option to add btc as payment.
@_date: 2015-04-25 06:26:13
Dunno how legit they are now, bought my gametimecards in the past there without problems.
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:09:15
Nice suggestion. Post that [here]( and you may get a small tip for that.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:00:25
Thanks for the donut ;)
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:43:43
Just don't do It! Never!!!  
Paypay an Bitcoin doesn't mix up until you want to get scammed.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:23:50
...and please avoid the western union option.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:40:10
Maybe something like [an up to date bitcoin price chart on your website]( from bitcoinity.org
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:45:23
Not a "Hooray news" but still belong here I guess.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:33:57
Just as workaround start TOR change the network settings in Bitcoin Core to [this]( restart Bitcoin Core and see if it start syncing.
@_date: 2015-09-03 03:56:58
If you choose to connect over TOR make sure you use the [right port and SOCKS Version](
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:52:45
[Link]( for the torrent
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:00:10
Just you "2 Factor Authorization" it doesn't protect against everything. But at least the keyloggers can't do much without the OTP
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:26:57
Looks like your Bitcoinclient is not connected to the bitcoin network.
Firewall or a antivirus blocking? Everthing in the Client network settings looks normal?  
Edit: And of course make a back up first!  
Edit II: If you cant connect through port 8333 maybe try to connect over tor to bypass this.
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:58:30
News about that from [techcrunch](
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:05:16
Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:44:59
Would prefer a "linked address" with a "copy adresse to clipboard button" next to it.  
With that everybody should be happy :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:28:58
Of course upvoted!  
Thanks for doing this, hope you had a good night.  
And maybe you found some spare btc under your pillow to tip ;D  
Again, nice move from you!
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:28:46
Always depends on the outcome, IMHO ;D

Hey, good morning Sir

Before you start marketing bitcoin you need a easy(self-explaining)-btc app and a really easy and hasslefree way to buy bitcoins.  
Then you can start your awesome marketing campain, imho.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:53:22
With the different that you need there customer-service on a regular basis, you can't say that about the TREZOR.  
And I pay nothing for my Bank account anyway!
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:18:45
Congrats, this is one of the things TREZOR needs so now the average joe can order his HW-btcwallet (with a CC) in his well known/trusted onlineshop.

* **9 x 6+2-Pin-PCIe**
* **5 x 6-pin PCIe**  
  
Not enough? ;)
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:14:50
Like the idea, one step in the right direction if SL offer a good discount.  
You could make marks like x discount after 50 sold, x discount after 100 sold etc.  
Every BTC-user should have a TREZOR or a similar device (if they get released anytime and are secure like TREZOR).
A perfect price for me would be something like a good wallet (50-60$ and if I have something to spare for devolping etc. I would give extra 10-20$ depends on my budget) but i willing to spend a little bit extra for the SL team.Who devolpe a great device!
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:05:32
Thats why it only work with 230v with 16 Amp
