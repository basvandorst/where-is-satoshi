Can someone point me to an explanation of native segwit. Interested of adding to my backbend. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 23:05:45
I am still mad about them breaking accounts.
Had to refactor a lot just for that

Mt gox ate a whole btc back in the day
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:32:55
Thanks! I ll have it ready for when other parts of the code have support for it.
@_date: 2019-03-31 11:32:26

Mate I have used btc since 2012, I just do not know if lighting is in bitcoin core and if I ll have to recompile it on prod to the new version if I want segwit :P . also fuck bchabc and bchsv just fuck em (and etc's buggy bs geth fork).
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:44:48

@_date: 2019-03-31 11:24:18
Can anyone please clear for me the pros/cons of ln and bip32 /n segwit?

you have a pen with a unique just yours one of the kind color
you write "FIRST" on a public wall that other people with their own unique pens also write things on.
to prove that your message was the first one on the wall you need to write something with that same unique pen again to distinguish yourself from all others.
the person with that first message and pen on bitcoin is the creator known by his handle as satoshi
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:16:25


yeah that is a snag


that is roi right there
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:44:39
lol no, the money is on high frequency trading and having a 1% better algorithm than the competition
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:39:30
sure that is why you must make it 3% faster
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:21:25
i think i saw this on the trolbox of btc-e back in 2013
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:25:47
i would give you gold but i bought btc
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:51:30
What I do not get get is that if you want something with lower fees, why not use xrp or ltc or eth or a at least semi competent alternative to bch
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:18:30
oh i read \`19 not `09

I like litecoin. Was more worth back in the day to move around small amounts.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:31:46
CRC not confirming
@_date: 2019-02-07 07:45:53
I know about lighting that is why I said back in the day
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:35:58
who even gives a shit who satoshi is? sure as fuck satoshi wont just come out to promote him/her/theirself or and shitcoins
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:37:55
What is that address?
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:54:19
yeah i would really like a more factual and less circlejerky sub to be honest.
more interested in the technology, less to posts about BtC IS So bEtteR ThAn USD
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:42:34
i still do, but i like lighting too
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:27:47
before ln we had ltc
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:41:18
Not even needed. Just use a new address each time and do not mix inputs
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:21:29
Nice circlejerk

Until you can print your own hw wallet, you are just as safe writing it on an encrypted removable volume or going with an offline wallet that makes txs which you then relay from another pc
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:42:08
Not how math or economics work
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:41:59
Still convinced that the latest drop was due to sv abc split. I having to support it.
The twats on their fork did not even change the default ports causing you to have to to have 2 different interfaces/ ips for running both btc and bch daemons.
The worse part of all of this, is I think they drink their own coolade
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:05:16
For android look for bitcoin wallets on f droid. They are all trusted and compiled by source without relying on third parties (if you trust fdroid and consider it first party)

i hate these words. i get physically angry when i see them.
i do not even have to read them. just the shape of `hurt` and `itself` enrages me.
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:49:16
that is simply not true. you need to own malicious nodes in the network to track someone.
especially true with P2EP that is coming and partial spend avoidance (as of 17.0)
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:33:56
Because that is dumb and we all know it.
60$ fees are not benefiting anyone 
e: not talking about a fork but something akin to lightning 
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:16:06
Errm no it can do with ~ 600MB with pruning enabled
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:20:57
That is some 2015 9gag shit right here
