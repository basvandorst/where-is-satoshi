Just be careful, there's been talk about fake ledger nano s' being sold on amazon

Bakkt is just as big of a deal as a Bitcoin ETF, if not more so

Not necessarily. Most ETF's in stock markets do hold a number of different stocks, however with commodities (like Bitcoin), the ETF is only tied to a single asset. Same with gold ETF's, they don't contain other precious metals or assets. 
Someone could propose a crypto ETF, but AFAIK the recent ETF's are Bitcoin specific.

If Bcash ever gets a futures market, the second it gets enough liquidity someone will short and attack

Neither is sending Bitcoin from one exchange to another, but the option for p2p still exists. Same with lightning

It really depends on timing. If your fee is right, and it's been awhile since the last block was mined, you can have it confirmed in a few minutes. Of course 0-conf is usually a good enough option for most people, but LN will definitely be a welcome improvement

Yep, blocks have seriously opened up a lot more space. I moved some Bitcoin to my Samourai wallet for a few cents, and it was broadcasted to my wallet almost instantly. 
If businesses want to start accepting Bitcoin, now's the time

Doesn't Bakkt accomplish the same goal for investors though? A custodial service which offers a regulated exchange and the potential for adding Bitcoin to your retirement fund seems to achieve  the same goals as a Bitcoin ETF

It has to do with the cost of running a full node, consensus, and decentralization 
As blocks get larger, there is more data that needs to be downloaded and propagated by each node every 10 minutes. Storage wouldn't be a huge problem in the short term, but over time the extra blocksize adds up, although storage has generally gotten cheaper and larger. The main issue is propagation, or how fast the whole network can receive, verify, and (possibly) send blocks. As blocksize increases, this becomes harder, due to bandwidth constraints, which causes nodes to drop out of the network (see Ethereum)
If miners started mining blocks above 1mb, nodes wouldn't propagate those blocks because they violate their personal rules, and would result in a hard fork
One of Bitcoin's biggest advantages is decentralization, which is hurt when individual users can't/won't run nodes due to bandwidth or storage issues. Big blocks can worsen this

BRB, gonna go replace my houses heating unit with asic miners

Looks cool, but I wish I had enough extra BTC lying around to test it out. I'm gonna have to wait for that 0.1 BTC rounding to drop a bit lower

I figured it was just growing pains, but I'll definitely try it out when the option is available. 
Just out of curiosity, what do you realistically see as the next minimum denomination, and when do you think the wallet will be ready to change to that denomination?
