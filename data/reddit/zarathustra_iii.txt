Thanks. You're stripping your true face. Such behavior of the small blockers helps a lot to marginalize their power.

Yes, and **zero** increase until half a year **after** the halving.

Their core coin that will be forked into an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:27:42
I still bet that the attack will not be successful. Difficult to imagine that the community will be this stupid. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:51:43


Yes, could be even more with the next wave of adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:15:36
Yes, and that will be the decision of the whole Bitcoin Marketplace.
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:40:48


Peter_R is not going. The 'committee' decided to ban him, despite (or because) his success in Montreal, while *several* blockstream core devs are allowed to speak. Surprise!
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:01:04
No problem. We now have DBF (destroy by fee). 
The destroyed txs will show up next time at Viacon, Monero, Litecoin.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:00:57
Very good approach for Litecoin, Viacoin, Monero. They will be happy to collect the transactions that are Destroyed By Fee (DBF).
Will the community be stupid enough to accept such an approach?
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:47:27


His alternative is running already.


He did discuss, but he didn't want to discuss endlessly.


Todd tried it as well. Is it bad to explain them the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-06 21:47:37
It does. Fidelity effect.
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:50:15
All in all, seems to be even less than a x2 capacity increase:
For how many month will it be 'the solution' in 2016, the year of the Great Halvening? April or even May?
@_date: 2015-12-27 08:20:59


You are using an implementation that has the opposite of development. Censorship, DBF(destroy by fee) and all that BS.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:47:17
Schopenhauer and Nietzsche are the most quoted German philosophers.
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:15:08


We know his view about this so called exploration: it is a tactic to prolong the stalemate.


That's a lie. Not good.


Everybody is working for someone. The conflict begins where an implementation is the only implementation and at the same time dominated by several people delegated by the same company.
@_date: 2015-12-27 08:03:23
Your Core coin will be the altcoin.

All you can is ad hominem. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:00:45
Yes, and that will lead to a situation where the pressures of the **marketplace** will enforce the decision.

@_date: 2015-12-01 19:25:51
It was mainly about scaling and it contributed the most for some people.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:20:17
His speech got banned.
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:50:10
No, they shouldn't anymore. They should stay with their crippled new coin. There are other implementations available that keep satoshis coin alive. There is no need to march with the totalitarian traitors of a libertarian project.
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:00:43
Spring 2012 - spring 2013 we had a 10fold txs increase!
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:48:07
I think, the market won't accept it as a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:11:32
Peter_R.'s paper is not allowed by 'the committee' to be presented.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:42:16
Yes, indeed, populist. It was for 'we the people', but not for the totalitarians and self declared elite.
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:48:40
Spring 2012 to spring 2013 (halving between) the txs tenfolded.
The core 'solution' is ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:18:23


Oh yeah! That's why Switzerland as the one and only direct democracy is the worst place on the planet! And that's why XAPO fled to Switzerland!

The problem with Blockstream is their conflict of interest. They were able to delegate **several** devs into core developing. It is high time that they get competition by other dev teams, which they obviously are trying to stop.
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:05:40
Incredible how you argue. Cherry picking a timespan that represents the 2 year correction phase.
Look back to 2012. 30 fold increase since then!
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:05:48
That's happening. Thanks to the behavior of the 'mods' on some forums. Decentralization makes progress.
@_date: 2015-11-25 09:23:31


I guess because the other subreddit is the uncensored one. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:46:00
Yes, that's what I say. A lot of proposals and still **talking** about a lot of proposals, despite full blocks! Even the core of the core wasn't able/willing to find a consensus among themselves. I'm curious if the industry will put an end to this tactic after Hong Kong.
@_date: 2015-11-21 07:44:12
But Todd says "Bitcoin is poorly designed". 
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:10:08
Gavin 2013:
"We can speculate all we want about what is going to happen in the future, but we don't really know.
So, what should we do if we don't know? My default answer is "do the simplest thing that could possibly work, but make sure there is a Plan B just in case it doesn't work."
In the case of the block size debate, what is the simplest thing that just might possibly work?
That's easy! Eliminate the block size limit as a network rule entirely, and trust that miners and merchants and users will reject blocks that are "obviously too big." Where what is "obviously too big" will change over time as technology changes.
What is Plan B if just trusting miners/merchants/users to do the right thing doesn't work?
Big-picture it is easy: Schedule a soft-fork that imposes some network-rule-upper-limit, with whatever formula seems right to correct whatever problem crops up.
Small-picture: hard to see what the "right" formula would be, but I think it will be much easier to define after we run into some actual practical problem rather than guessing where problems might crop up."
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:09:47


Peter R. is the one who is fighting for competition in development, which means decentralization of development and therefore more security to the whole bitcoin project.
It is disappointing that gmax leaves the scene instead to welcome all kind of competition. The bitcoin 'community' should become a competing community instead of a one party system. That's communism and doesn't work.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:25:23
I am not as pessimistic as Mike. I really think that Core will be **forced** to act very soon. The blocks are full and you know it. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:17:25
Gavin is also part of Core, but they are not part of blockstream core.
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:39:46
All in all, the opposite of progress happened. There is a fight against competition and decentralization of development  and a lack of decisively and publicly positioning against banning tactics and censorship. That behavior disappoints me the most.
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:24:15
So even among the core devs there is still no consensus and they intend to talk about several proposals again? That's exactly what Mike predicted. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:40:42
LOL. Garzik is on the side of those who want to raise the limit, in opposition of those who don't really want: the Blockstream devs.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:47:02
They are only talking instead of raising the limit. Talk is cheap.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:30:06
Congratulations to the core of the core ! Awesome job!
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:37:39
What the majority even in this subreddit thinks can easily been discovered if you look how the majority votes. That's why randy's post is on top and not the censorship cheerleading ones. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:03:25
And no increase in 2016, the halvening year. The year around the last halvening saw a 10 fold transaction increase. I would be surprised if they'll try to sell the community this solution. Wouldn't that be suicidal?
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:33:36
The self destruction is stickied. 
They're deleting again. In this thread. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:24:57
Looking at the votes, the community seems to believe that the mods are the real trolls. How is this possible? 
Should the mods learn something from this fact, or should they ignore it?
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:28:11
It is unbelievable what's going on here, but it is the reality!
How is it possible that the mods cannot realise what they are doing?
@_date: 2015-10-14 08:31:23


ad hominem, 
which is mostly allowed if it goes against big blockers
@_date: 2015-11-26 12:55:18
Did you reallly come to a consensus proposal within the Blockstream devs?
@_date: 2015-11-22 20:39:06
This censored subreddit seems to be organized (Organized violence).
But those tactics help to decentralize the communication.
This complicity of authoritarian development and communication will not survive.
@_date: 2015-10-16 08:12:50




Do you not understand? "It does not matter whether you claim to be acting upon your conflict of interest or not - the conflict of interest is real and could be affecting your bias."
If you want to argue honestly, you have to admit that it is a fact that this is a grotesque situation when an anarchist peer-to-peer environment is represented and controlled by a development team, in which several members of a single company are working.
In a trustless environment we do not want to be forced to trust you and your company. 
What are you intending to do against this unhealthy, disproportionate situation?
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:28:48


Yes. They fork themselves off the community together with its cheerleaders. Censoring, banning, centralism and corporatism should not have a future with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 10:24:03
Since authoritarianism is the most disgusting thing that is hurting bitcoin, there is a good reason that some users engage in this matter firstly and mostly.
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:59:22


Ridiculous conspiracy theories won't help to hide the truth.
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:21:19
Competition is no problem. The problem is a one-company-sponsored development without competition. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:41:48
Yes, and since that didn't happen at core, Mike and Gavin wrote a BIP, an implementation and tested it. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:14:21
Great, the days of the 1MB core stalemate are numbered. It won't be possible to prolong the stalemate any longer.
@_date: 2015-10-14 11:00:08
Other bitcoin subreddits represent other members of the community.
Their opinions are as valuable as your opinion.
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:04:40
The cheerleaders of the censors are those who left the community.
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:10:45


We are free to enlighten who ever and where ever we want, as long as we are not censored and banned. Look at the comment at the top of this thread. Food for thought.
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:09:33




If the final decision makers don't behave benevolent, the XT software will fork the same way as core already did. 
„Does XT make Mike and Gavin dictators?
Some people are portraying XT vs Core as “Dictatorship vs Meritocratic Consensus”. This isn’t right.
Gavin and I can’t be ‘dictators’ because all we do is write software: if we go crazy, or do other things you disagree with, XT can be forked in exactly the same way as we did.
But that’s not the real reason that statement is wrong. Many don’t seem to realise this, but Bitcoin Core uses exactly the same leadership model as XT for everything except the block size debate. Virtually all code changes in Core are not made by consensus, but rather, by Wladimir van der Laan (the maintainer) making a decision by himself.
We can see this easily in a disagreement that flared up on Monday:...“




Not being able to fork the protocol and prevent competition is even more dangerous for Bitcoin. This at least is my view (and the view of many other bitcoiners). 






Yes, but in a different environment. This new environment represents competition and different competing implementations, because there is no consensus.


Yes. Why should it be viewed as negative? Normal market behavior. Competitors are presenting their solutions and products. 




As I wrote already, I would be glad to see you activly and loudly fight against censorship in our bitcoin environment. 
Reddit is a voting system. All sides try to collect votes. It is a market and it is competition. It doesn't help to accuse each other of collecting votes and construct conspiracy theories against each other and censoring opinions, based on such theories. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:12:56


Ad hominem.
This public community (Bitcoin) is dominated by devs who work for one company. This is a fact, and that this fact is an unhealthy fact should be crystal clear to everybody. Either the community may exempt from this domination, or the project is a failure.
@_date: 2015-10-17 13:39:56
If txs volume soon increases ubruptly - which it did several times, especially around the last halving (tenfold in 1 year) - there will be implementations that are ready and others that are not. The latter will be forked out of the game. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 10:36:43


As I explained already, we are not forced to stay here and enlighten others. We are free to do it as long as we are not banned. Many are already. But that won't help them to stay in control. Either they stop such behavior, or they lose. It's their choice.
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:59:47


Yes, but it is irrelevant what you assure and what I assume. This is our argument. It is the disproportion which is the problem.
Mike is the only one who represents circle and other companies, but Blockstream delegates several devs. Many community-members don't like this disproportion and don't want to tolerate it anymore, and that's the reason why they are organising competition for core, which I see as a very healthy development, while others defined this competition as an attack and applauded to censorship agitations, to DDos, to faked nodes and such anti-bitcoin-behavior. 


That's all okay. But now, as you see, many individuals and companies are not in consensus with the core developers anymore. Those developers, companies and individuals are not your enemies; they are just competitors.


That's your view. The new situation is different. Bitcoin is a market, and this market is ruled by competition. The consensus story is over since core failed to reach consensus on a key question. 


Everything can change. Once upon a time the main bitcoin forums have been moderated pro bitcoin. 
Now it's the opposite. The moderators are acting anti bitcoin and as a consequence, the community is forking. 
I never read your view about this excessive banning and censorship behavior. I would appreciate if you as a charismatic individual would fight loudly against such selfdestructive behavior.
