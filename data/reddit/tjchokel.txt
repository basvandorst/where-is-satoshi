Tom from CoinSafe here.
Thanks for your feedback! I wanted to reassure you that this has been part of a 6-week process, and any users who had a non-trivial balance were contacted a while ago and went through a stricter withdrawal process. We still have a few stragglers that we are helping set up their own cold storage, but I'm happy to announce that we have returned all but ~2 BTC worth of funds.
While we are really excited about our new direction, we are still big cold storage proponents. Anyone should feel free to contact support if they ever have any questions related to storing bitcoin!

It's coming! The first step was getting the app out there :)

This limit would only be on transaction requests coming from our app through the API - we definitely don't want Coinbase limiting user withdrawals!

Email support and we'll help you out!

Before any funds are transferred, the merchant (or the cashier) must enter their admin password to confirm that the cash has been received. This must be done for every transaction, so while the thief might have a new phone, the bitcoin would be safe.

We go to great lengths to keep all sensitive information secure (all data is encrypted on transmission / within the database, all databases are secured with two factor authentication, all calls are heavily logged and monitored, etc). Our previous business was providing Bitcoin cold storage as a service, so we know a thing or two about Bitcoin security!
That being said, whenever giving a third party access to your API credentials, we recommend creating a separate wallet with a small amount of funds. This minimizes the risk for all parties and makes accounting easier, and you can always top it off whenever it gets low.

Cold storage guide is back up at: 
Also, we've decided to keep using CoinSafe.com for our new venture (CloseCoin was just a placeholder).

This is a good point, we will look into it!
We also let the merchant manually override the required 1 confirmation in cases where they trust the customer, it is for a small amount of money, etc.

Currently we don't. 
Eventually we plan on offering additional services such as international remittance, instant bitcoin cash-out, etc, but we feel strongly that our current product should always be free.
