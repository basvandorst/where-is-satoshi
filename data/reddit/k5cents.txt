I think "intellect" is too complex an idea to be reduced to IQ or median income. The skills it takes to write a persuasive, well research paper on campaign finance reform are different than those needed to write effective and efficient computer code. I think we need more science in the arts and we need more arts in the science. I can use statistical coding to help improve policy analysis and STEM students can use philosophical theory to better their scientific endeavors. Us vs them mentalities don't help anybody.

2/4 of the recipients are my grandparents. I'm not expecting them to get into day trading, follow Bitcoin, even buy any more crypto at all.

Maybe LTC is my only option right now though.

This is some infuriatingly reductionist elitist shit if I've ever seen it. All liberal arts major students are suddenly idiots? I'm a political science student with a love of future studies, so I own a little. Painting people with broad brush strokes of "smart" and "fucking idiots" is ridiculous.

Mostly I figured they could simply hold onto the paper wallets until fees are fixed or the coins are worth enough to spend a little of their own money to withdrawal them. I'm really not sure.

You'll here it all over the place, but it's worth reiterating: ONLY BUY WHAT YOU CAN LOOSE.
If I were less lazy, I'd link you to some of the horror stories (particularly on of users losing their life savings buy investing. Bitcoin is probably the "safest" cryptocurrency, and it's definitely the most established, but THERE IS NOTHING GIVING IT VALUE beyond what people agree on.
Make sure you know the base technology behind Bitcoin. Do your research.
Choose a quality exchange and wallet (forget what people say on here, Coinbase is perfect for beginners).
Use dollar-cost-averaging to mitigate risk (spread an investment over time in small chunks, that way your less likely to fall victim to a flash crash fucking you over).
And, again, don't put any more money into cryptocurrency than you can afford to lose. It's safest to consider investments as sunk costs in your budget. 
Try not to check the price every hour or even every day, unless you're ambitious enough to attempt some kind of day trading (which I strongly recommend against). 
One last time for the people in the back, don't put any more money into cryptocurrency than you can afford to lose!

You send bitcoin to the private key. They open it up to reveal the private key and scan that private key into their app of choice (if they wish). Just owning the private key QR means they _have_ the bitcoin. Whatever they chose to do with that private key at that point is up to them.
I'm doing the same thing. I think the physical paper wallets represent a lot of what's cool about bitcoin. After they open the cards I'm gonna offer to help them set up a digital wallet if they so desire.

Yeah, most _new_ Chrome OS devices. But my Chromebox desktop is likely never getting Google Play support (although I have Linux, so that is a workaround).
I'm still very much anti-Android apps on a laptop or desktop interface. It just sucks. Poorly designed and poorly running. 
I'm now reading that you can still _use_ and even _download_ Chrome Apps from the Webstore, but you just won't be able to _search_ for them. 
I've extracted the CRX file just to be safe. As long as the Ledger firware supports support for the deprecitated interface, it should be fine.

I'm probably the only person on Earth upset by this. The only computers I own run Chrome OS; I have a Chromebook Pixel and a ASUS Chromebox. I bought my Ledger specifically for the Chrome OS support.
This post says the update "will also break compatibility with the Chromebook platform." Will the current Chrome App remain on the Chrome Webstore for people like me?
I do have Ubuntu side-loaded on my Chromebox, but prefer to do most of my work in the standard Chrome OS. I suppose the Android app will work on most Chromebooks going forward.
Edit: Even if it is removed from the chrome webstore, perhaps the Ledger team could provide the .crx file needed to download the app. I'm just hoping they don't end support.

In my opinion, the fact they don't _need_ to be durable is part of the beauty of Bitcoin and hardware wallets. 
The coins aren't on the device, you don't need to freak out about durability. The coins are on the Blockchain where they are _invincible!_ 
It might be nice to have a durable device so you never lose access, but your coins are never more than a replacement device and backup seed away.

Chrome Apps ≠ Google Chrome, or even Google. Chromebooks have zero possibility of any malicious software watching or intercepting anything. The Ledger is still securing all the cryptography, the Chrome App (which is developed _by_ Ledger Wallets and is all Open-Source) is just the interface.

It seems like there needs to be an effort to shift the narrative from "storing your Bitcoin" to "_accessing_ your Bitcoin." 
From what I understand, all the Bitcoin are stored on the Blockchain, you just use your Hot/Cold/Web wallet to manipulate those coins via a private key. 
There are no coins _on_ your Ledger or on your Desktop, just a key that lets you _access_ your coins.

Your hardware wallet kind of *is* just a sheet of paper with your seed on it, since you need to write down the private key seed when you first initialize the device. Those 24 words are just as capable of controlling the coins as the hardware wallet is. But you can hide that paper in a safe and "hide" the device with a PIN, which is much easier to interface with on a regular basis.

Make sure you put some of that energy to use mining! My biggest problem with Bitcoin is the energy consumption; but that's not a problem inherent to Bitcoin, that's a problem inherent to our energy infrastructure. Solar, wind, and hydro totally undercut the energy argument against Bitcoin. In fact, as Andreas has talked about, mining actually incentives renewable construction by making a feasible store of value when (traditional) demand falls below the uncontrollable supply.
