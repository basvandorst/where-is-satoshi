Thanks. That helps. 
Do you have a link to some examples or use cases? I can imagine scenarios, but I'm not sure if my imagination is meshing well with the reality. 
What I'm not understanding is what I do with my XCP, or how that XCP relates to BTC. I've bought &amp; sold XCP on Poloniex, but I've not actually had an XCP wallet. 
Do you have a link that can help me understand that there?

Put them up for sale in several exchanges. Spread them around, e.g. some at 460, 461, 462, etc. Then just wait for your orders to get picked up. 
Or just do it on 1 exchange and slowly feed them into the order books as you're comfortable with. 
Now, if Bitcoin goes mainstream with people being paid in BTC, then it won't matter --- you'll just be able to pay for what you want in BTC. 
If we're talking simple, normal bubble or high/peak scenarios, then most likely it doesn't matter how you do it as the volume will be there and you can simply sell into the market depth with no significant impact, unless you have a LOT of bitcoins.

You can get the same net effect by buying and selling different crypto on different exchanges, e.g. buy DOGE on Cryptsy, sell it at Poloniex, buy LTC at Polo, sell at BTC-e, buy BTC at BTC-e, etc.

It's far from unrealistic. You can make a decent amount of coins then trade them for others and increase the amount of BTC you have. It only takes a bit of time, patience, willingness to learn, and willingness to take a few risks here and there. 
By mining different coins, eventually you'll hit one that sticks and it will be profitable.

You need to keep the amount of information very restricted when creating a message. Explaining Bitcoin is far too much in 30 seconds for a Bitcoin payment company to get in.

Yeah, but a lot of those are from Coindesk, and everyone knows that the truth of something depends on whether the publisher is owned by News Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, CBS, and Comcast. 
Also, The Guardian is suspect as a source because has published leaks from traitors. 
And Business Insider often publishes right-wing, free market stuff, so it can't be trusted. 
The Register? Like, can anyone take them seriously when they publish the BOFH electrocuting people? 
Now, the BBC, there's a reliable source! They never [fake photos]( or [dub in audio to change stories](

No. 
It is not moral to inflict violence/aggression on others. Ever. 
But something not being moral doesn't necessarily mean that it is immoral or amoral. e.g. Eating an apple has no moral significance. Unless you're an apple. :P But seriously... 
It is morally permissible to inflict violence/aggression on others in defence of oneself or others. 
Voting is the same. Voting is an act of aggression against others. 
If self defence is morally praise worthy, then voting to end voting is morally praise worthy. 
But, meh... whatever. Using technology like the Internet and Bitcoin are far more effective.

* It's illegal

* Conclusion: Lots of risk

The current USA only imprisons more than any other country on Earth, and still has the best constitution.
North Korea and China also have lovely constitutions. 
At some point it makes sense to give up on what simply doesn't work. Governments don't work... or at least not for people.

I can't see throwing people out of their homes as anything other than unbridled evil. 
"Gee, I'm sorry that you lost your job and your spouse died, but you know how it is... the law is the law and you do owe those property taxes... I'm sure there's a shelter somewhere for you... I think there's an orphanage that you can send your kids to so that they're taken care of..."

Whether or not he is right about there being cancer viruses in vaccines (or whatever) doesn't validate or invalidate other things he says. 
He is right about a lot of things. Heck, a lot of what he says is just reporting news from AP or Reuters. 
He makes no pretense to be neutral, which is admirable. In the MSM they're so horribly skewed it isn't funny, and they pretend to be neutral reporters. 
At least with AJ you know what you're getting. You can take some &amp; leave some.

It would stall and no transactions would be processed. Bitcoins would be then completely worthless.

Do you understand how these systems work at all? That's just a silly statement. You have at best the illusion of control. You do not actually have control as you need to trust a third party. This is what Bitcoin is about - fuck the third party and take control of your own finances.

Yes. There is. He's a statetheist, so, violence is the only thing he's capable of understanding. Check out his comment above [here](


The people in don't advocate violence, but he can't see through that. He's not capable of understanding sarcasm either. His entire existence is consumed by his zealotry for the State. 
He can't conceptualize anarchy at all. He probably watches MSNBC and assumes that he's being told the truth. 
When he says:


He's just parroting the MSM. He wouldn't believe you if you showed him evidence that police officers act as agent provocateurs either, because that wouldn't fit in with his world view that he holds so dear.

So, this?
    name_new &lt;name&gt;
Where the name is the "key". 
Wait a few blocks for it to register on the blockchain, then:
    name_firstupdate &lt;name&gt; &lt;rand&gt; [&lt;tx&gt;] &lt;value&gt;
Where value is the "value". 
I'm more familiar with Huntercoin, and that's about what I'd do to create a player there. 
So, just for example, I might send name as:
    AliceAndBob
And the value as:
    Got married to each other today on the blockchain.
I'm not sure of the Namecoin transaction fees for length. A lot of that work is being done in Huntercoin now.

No. It won't.
Because you can't tip fiat from a wallet that YOU control. You must fund it first, which is a serious impediment. The additional costs in fiat tipping are just insane. It's not worth it when you have a $0.50 flat fee to tip plus a percentage... This is why crypto is so much better. i.e. In a digital world, fiat is idiotic for small payments while crypto is not.

Some major points to hit:
* Fiat is doomed due to abuse
* Fiat is a tool to steal from people through inflation
* Fractional reserve banking is not possible with Bitcoin
* Bitcoin ETFs **CANNOT** be resolved in bitcoins and **MUST** be resolved in fiat (examine what would happen if the gold/silver ETFs all demanded delivery and you'll see why this is true)
Look at what Andreas Antonopolous has to say. Search YouTube for that. He'll blow your mind.
Look at the actual charts (log) and see how volatility is decreasing while BTC is increasing against fiat. 
Look at what Gary North and Peter Schiff have to say on Bitcoin and the rebuttals to them. 
Look at predictions of the traditional Keynesian economists and how they fail to predict anything, then look at the Austrian economists and see how they perform. Next, look at the debates over Bitcoin by the Austrian economists. (Gary and Peter are Austrians.)
Look into crypto-anarchism or cypherpunk. That will give you the basis for what Bitcoin is about. Also look into anarcho-capitalism. You cannot separate the underlying philosophy from Bitcoin - you don't need to agree with it, but that doesn't matter. People **CHOOSE** to use Bitcoin because it is good for them. They agree with the politics of it (or apolitics if you will), even if they publicly denounce those politics.  by There are tonnes of resources out there. 
Good luck with the paper! :)

The Bitcoin protocol **IS** the enforcement. The more people that use it, the better. But everyone can see that Bitcoin is a better way and personally beneficial. Even socialists use it. Bitcoin is toxic to socialism. But, socialists are still greedy and selfish (probably more so). 
All that is required is for people to use Bitcoin - they do not need to agree with the underlying philosophy.

Meh... Not so sure. If people continue to say "fuck banks" and continue to lose faith in government, cryptocurrency will still continue to rise as a populist/grass roots technology. Sure, it won't make it into high finance, but who cares if it's being used daily for groceries and the like? That will likely all be much slower though. 
But the entire idea of "regulate Bitcoin" is entirely misguided - you CANNOT regulate Bitcoin. Period. End of story. 
You CAN regulate how people use it... There's a big difference there, and currently people are using the wrong language to describe what the regulators want to achieve. 
"Regulating Bitcoin" would mean opening up vi and typing code. Well, not really... but they would need to pass regulation on the actual code itself, which is just silly.

It competes with their business. If people used Bitcoins, they'd have no need for foreign exchange outlets. FX businesses would be shooting themselves in the foot if they encouraged Bitcoin. They would have short term profits, but they'd also be accelerating the broader adoption of bitcoins and that would undermine their long term business.

That's irrelevant. Products are regulated all the time, and some products are illegal due to laws/regulations. Jurisdictions matter. Bitcoin is outside of any government's jurisdiction due to its decentralised nature. But, there are people inside of their jurisdictions that can be controlled. 
The fact is that they cannot regulate the production of Bitcoin. It's not possible for them. It seems that most people don't quite understand this though. Pointing out that they can't helps reveal that governments are not all-powerful. 
Clarifying that governments are only trying to regulate how people use Bitcoin also helps expose that they are not all-powerful. 
It shifts the focus and clarifies what they are trying to achieve, i.e. restrict your freedom.

Yes... IE is the best browser to use, but you can get by without it. You can use a Mac even. This has been true for a few years. 
I've been dealing with this shit for a VERY long time (and you have no idea about just how much pain I have endured dealing with Korean banking over the years). Think back to the beginning of Internet banking in Korea... (I even did work for some of the early payment gateways there and got to see the tech side up close from an insider perspective.) 
Back in 2002 or so, you had to use IE for Korean Internet banking. It just didn't work otherwise. But that was then. This is now. 10+ years is a long time to get things done. 
The ZDnet author there just doesn't know what he's talking about. He's just parroting some shit he read with zero experience. In fact, he's fucking lying and probably a piece of shit shill. 
Here's the proof (Korea Exchange Bank):
The line that starts "MS IE(" just says that the information below is for non-IE users to read. 
The next line says that you can use online banking with the OSes and browsers listed. 
(I'm paraphrasing.) 
Below the OS images, it literally says:




Similar on the right side there. 
This is not new. 
So, no. Buddy is just full of shit &amp; doesn't know what he's talking about. Both the poster above &amp; the shill at ZDnet. 
Korea is a fucking amazing country, with a wildly techno-savvy population that just adores new gadgets and technologies. 
Some of the coolest shit out there comes from Korea. 
If you want to find out what will be popular next year, go to Korea. You'll see it on the shelves.

I think that hate is a given and doesn't need to be said. KYC and AML are just control mechanisms by overreaching states. What I do with my money/bitcoins is none of their business. 
KYC and AML presume a level of guilt in a society where you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. There is no justification for it whatsoever. KYC and AML are simply tools for tyrants. 
But, you wanted "hate for the businesses collecting KYC information"...
I fucking loathe any business that asks for any information that isn't 100% necessary for us to complete a transaction. This includes banking, online services, exchanges, etc. 
Very, very rarely is it ever justified for a business/organisation to ask for any personally identifying information. 
Yes - personal information is needed in banking for loans, but certainly not for deposit accounts with positive balances. 
No - personal information is not needed for services such as utilities that can be prepaid or guaranteed with a deposit. 
I regularly refuse to use services that require personal information when it is not needed, though I am coerced into using others. I boycott and buycott aggressively. 


How is that not solved by signing already? 
There is zero legitimate reason to address KYC or AML with bitcoin given that addresses can be signed to prove ownership. The ONLY reasons are for control and domination - neither of which end well for people. 


The problem there is that hashes can be used to identify people. If someone doesn't actually need the KYC information, they certainly don't need a hash of it. Well, unless there is some kind of nefarious game being played against the interests of people. 
Purchases can be recorded, along with the hashes associated with those purchases. That information can be passed upline then sold or disseminated. You cannot solve the problem with hashes when you attach personal information there. There are ways around that and they will be exploited. 
Eventually you'll just end up with KFC needing KYC "hashes". I don't mean that as an exaggeration. Big Data right now is extremely scary, and what they can do is terrifying. Attaching any kind of "tack on" to bitcoins isn't going to end well when the problem is a non-issue thanks to signatures proving ownership. 
So the hate you're getting here is merely the same hate for KYC/AML nonsense. If you hop into bed with them, well... you're likely to contract the same disease...

Andreas, while your presentation was excellent, I wasn't surprised in the least as you always seem to perform at 110%. :)
What did surprise me was how amicable the senators seemed to be, and how more than a couple questions were positive or at least not overtly negative. Your handling of the questions was stellar, though at times I was thinking, "Ok, yeah, I understand that, but man... that's a lot to unpack for anyone not very familiar with cryptocurrencies." 
Did you get the sense that the senators really understood what you were saying, or did you get the sense that here and there you had some "deer in the headlights"? (I hope the former.)

True, but it then requires monitoring not only the email, but also the web connection. i.e. Multiple connections need to be compromised. 
What I pasted above was only part of the email. Other parts of the email let me confirm that it was from the site itself, and was not intercepted (unless the server was compromised). i.e. It had all the products I had ordered, and since the web connection was over HTTPS, the TLS/SSL connection would have to be compromised or the server itself.

What about Canadian expats? Maintaining an address in Canada seems a bit onerous of a requirement simply to trade bitcoins/litecoins/CAD. 
To be honest, the KYC/AML requirements are just way over the top. Driver's license? What about people that don't drive? 
The system is exclusionary and broken. Now, I'm not blaming you for this, but the requirements need to be addressed - whether that's by companies like Virtex lobbying the government to pull their heads out of their asses or whatever... 
I was verified last year, and when I went back to trade again... god... more KYC/AML horrors to deal with. I've already been there and done that. I now get this message:


That's a pretty damn scary message. There's no way in hades I'd send coins under those conditions. I'm not one of the bad guys, but because of a few assholes out there, now I need to deal with this? Really? Being heavy handed with your customers isn't a great way to foster a healthy relationship. (I get that you are coerced by government into a lot of things.) 
I get that there are a few bad people out there, but why must everything be completely fucked up for the regular people out here just because of them? Aren't there already laws on the books to deal with fraud and the like? Must we punish everyone because of 1 jackass?

For you to mine like that, miners would need to sloooooowly drop out of the network and the difficulty would need to adjust down. It would take a very long time for that to happen, but eventually, with you as the only miner, and with the difficulty adjusting down sloooooooowly to a manageable level for you, then yes.

This might be helpful:
To be honest, New York regulators have their heads so far up their asses that they'll never see the light of day ever again. I wouldn't hold out much hope there. Hope for the best - plan for the worst? (I can see Texas creating regulations just to get people to move there and spite New York...) 
But you may be able to get a company set up outside NY or outside the country and simply run it from where you are. Lots of Bitcoin companies in Panama...

The number changes, but the 9 figure is really only theoretical. Some countries have no reserve requirement, so the number is undefined, or infinite if you want to put it that way, or incidental/accidental. It all depends on the country and specific institution.

If you're trying combinations, what you're looking for is a Cartesian Product, or Cross Join. Here's a start:
Come up with as many possible variations and types as possible. When you run the Cartesian Product, you should have tens or several hundred or thousand.
I had a similar problem with a FreeNAS password. This utility I wrote was for user IDs and passwords:
It's *similar* to what you want. The source for it is available as well, so you can have a peek or modify it if you need. 
I have some other software that I wrote a while back for a mobile device artificial intelligence project that I worked on, and it uses Cartesian Products. I'll see if I can dig it out and see if I can instead work it into a kind of password generator and perhaps a wallet.dat cracker.

Dang! Property didn't exist prior to government... Man, have I got a lot to learn! 
But that's some seriously cool shit to know! 
And guess what I found out! Government had been around since darn near the Big Bang! I didn't know that either until today. I checked it out, and it's true. 
Godvernment defines what a "day" is! (And “night” too.) 




So, obviously there were no days prior to Godvernment. That would just be absurd. But even if there were (which is just silly), those days wouldn't be "real" days - they'd just be fake days because they weren't officially recognised by Godvernment. 
Silliness aside, "that there is a legal definition" for property doesn't mean that the definition creates property. 
Even animals have "property". For proof, just go into the den of any mother bear, or try to take a dead zebra away from some hungry lions. Their arguments are, um, convincing? Is that the right word? :D

Fiat currencies distribute debt over the entire system in order to obfuscate the nature of the debt and mimic fungibility. When debts are not repaid, the impact affects the entire system and destabilises the fiat currency. We saw this in 1997 during the Asian currency crisis. 
Bitcoin-based loans have no such weakness. Bitcoins themselves are fungible and do not need to mimic fungibility like fiat currencies do. So defaults in loans there only affect the parties to the agreement, and not the entire system. 
The entire nature of the loan in the fiat vs. Bitcoin system is fundamentally different. 
The criteria for making a loan in each system are different.

But this is a common pattern - The Blacklist and Person of Interest - ideas are sold on 2 shows. Watch more carefully and you'll see this very often. In a given week 2 similar shows will have identical elements in the plot/story. 
This is very common in The Simpsons. Paired up with that is American Dad sometimes. There are a few.

I sincerely hope that you only plan on limiting the freedoms of the people within your own jurisdiction. As I don't live in your jurisdiction, I will not comply with any of your regulations unless by accident it happens to suit me. 
I also hope that you do not limit the freedoms of the people you purport to rule over in such a way that you prevent them from interacting with me. It's a big world, so there are likely other people that I can interact with, and it would be to the detriment of the people of New York if you stifle their ability to interact with others. 
Your government has a record of stifling freedom. I hope that your department departs from that trend. For the sake of the people of New York, and for those of us outside that may wish to voluntarily interact with the people of New York.

I have a glass on my desk because the state says it's ok for me to have that? 
Oh, FFS, this is just so utterly insane. 
Sorry - but NO! My owning my pencil or car or butt plug or whatever isn't contingent on the state saying that I'm "allowed" to own that. 
Do you really believe that the state gives you permission to own your own property???
I own myself without any permission from the state. I similarly own my own property without any permission from the state.

No. The same thing could not have happened with Bitcoin as your transactions do not need to be authorised by a 3rd party. 
If it is a case of fraud prevention, then it's fraud prevention *not* working properly. For the cop, yes - a complete idiot. Also the wait staff. They only need to pick up the phone to call it in and they can get authorised that way. 
This is a good example of a traditional payment system breaking in ways that Bitcoin can't, with the consequences of being arrested for the payment system breaking.

I think at the core of this all, we are in an information war. A war of ideas. 
A lot of people have some very violent, aggressive, evil ideas about how they want to force others to do what they want. They often don't even realise what they are saying. 
Now, to win that war, killing them all is probably a bad idea. It didn't work for Stalin, and it didn't work for Mao. (Incidentally, probably the most successful state there is North Korea.) 
But slowly getting people to realise that murder, violence, aggression, fraud, and theft are bad ways to behave... well... If enough people actually understand that, and accept that, then we have the start to what could be a beautiful era of freedom, peace, and prosperity.

Vitriol? I have not yet begun... 
But you asked for it you fucking shitlord. 
You're a complete fucking idiot talking about what you know nothing about. 
I'm a citizen of a country in the EU. You know fuck all about me. Go fuck yourself in the face with a chainsaw. Or the ass if you prefer. I don't care. Just please use a chainsaw. I don't care if it's made in China.  
Fuck yourself and all your EU-loving cocktards. There are a fucking shitload of us out here that hate the EU and want nothing to do with it. Fuck your socialist overlords and fuck you for being a socialist ass-monkey for the commie shitknobs in Brussels. 
The EU is a goddamn disgrace. It fucks everyone in Europe. Nobody in Europe is better under the EU. The piss-lickers in Brussels are nothing more than criminal asswads. In a just world they'd spend the rest of eternity in... I'll skip that graphic description. ;) 
In the few hundred of years since "Europe" has been, nothing but shit has come for my people -- slavery and starvation and misery. 
Europe has been a blight on humanity for few centuries. What the fuck qualifies any European to not continue that blight? 
Have I told you to go fuck yourself with a chainsaw yet? ;) 
Please take your fucking shithole of Europe and fuck off. You bring nothing but death and misery wherever you go. (I'm assuming you're a mainlander European - Tell me to fuck off if I'm wrong.) 
You're probably some socialist piece of shit that wants to rape everyone that's productive so you can coast by doing fuck all. 
Fuck Brussels. Fuck the EU. And fuck you. 
Now, was that some decent vitriol for you? If not, I'll really have to try a lot harder.

This is kind of one of those areas where I really enjoy programming. 
I've stripped an old project that suited your problem, and written up a password combination generator:
It's there with full source code. 
As I'd mentioned above, it's based on a Cartesian Product. The blog post explains more about how you can use it to crack your own passwords. Well, actually to generate a password dictionary that you can use in another password cracking utility. 
I've not written a wallet.dat cracking utility before, but if I have time, I'll try to have a go at it and see if I can get one working. 
So, that'll help you generate a list. Hopefully reading through that will help you focus enough to get down the right general words and characters so that you can get your wallet back. 
I'll also post this in the Bitcoin Talk Forums. Look for "RenegadeMind" there. 
**If someone would be so kind as to look through the source code, that would be appreciated. Just to ensure that it does what I say it does, and that it's not some kind of malware. There are douchewads out there posting fake clients with trojans and crap.** 
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:38:07
I either think in full coins or satoshis. That works easily enough. 
100 million satoshis? Sure. That's an easy number to work with. Anything less is easier. 100 million isn't a big number today for most people to understand. Above 1 billion and things get hairy. 3 groups of "000" are good. More? Not so much. 
Satoshis work pretty well when I'm talking to other people as well. Given they understand Bitcoin and other coins, but the math is easy that way. 100 million = 1 BTC. Think of it as cents vs. dollars. Kind of. Or maybe not. But close enough. :)

No. Regulating production is not the same as regulating usage. 
Look at how milk is regulated. There are prescriptions on how it must be done, e.g. pasteurized, etc. (Same goes for other products and how they are manufactured.) 
For milk, regulating human behaviour would be something like "you not allowed to use milk for an enema" or "milk may only be drunk from glass drinking vessels and not ones made out of plastic". That is regulating human behaviour in relation to milk, which is distinct from regulating the production. 
The current way people are talking about "regulating Bitcoin" at best ambiguous and at worst simply wrong. 
Yes - it is a convenient shorthand, but it's still confuzzling the issue.

Anyways... we're looking at the modern fiat currencies imploding under the weight of debt and interest. They're as good as cooked. Bitcoin doesn't suffer from the abuse that fiat suffers from, so, there's one angle for you to look into.

But it won't be a collapse. They can't manage a collapse. It will only be a series of crises that they'll use with the Hegelian dialectic (problem, reaction, solution) to consolidate control as they pit people against each other. 
People keep saying "collapse", but it won't be a "collapse". It will be engineered crises. Totalitarian tiptoe. Slow and methodical. There won't be any Mad Max scenario.

That's what I was wondering. The first "altcoin" was exactly this -- alternative distributed decentralised DNS.

This is what the war on cash looks like. 
Governments are bankrupt, and any single transaction that is beyond their ability to steal their cut from is unacceptable to them. They're jonesing for money, and eliminating cash is one way they'll sink their vampire teeth into you.

I guess it depends on how you transact. I've dealt with Korbit and been very happy. That might be one fee, but... It's Bitcoin. I'm sure you can find a way around that. :)

There will be no global "collapse". It will be a crisis, but not a collapse. The crisis will be managed, and people will be forced to give up more rights and surrender more of their wealth. 
Bitcoin will help fuel a real economy/market there.

I would love to see it happen, but I won't hold my breath. It would revolutionise finance the world over very quickly. I'd expect revolutions (or coups) more frequent than in Thailand. 
The best I would ever hope for would be to see the BRICS set up a basket of currencies for oil purchases (similar to SDR) and include Bitcoin in it. 
That would still disrupt a lot.

No, but it will gain popularity as banks fail and resort to bail-ins, like in the March 2013 Canada economic policy paper on page 145:


So the purchasing power of Bitcoin will go up. 
While that won't save the world, it will save the butts of some people who had the foresight to buy bitcoins before the crisis. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 16:52:36

But it is. The point of a large amount is asking just how much you really and truly believe something.

As easy as it sounds, that is way too hard a lesson to learn without experience. 
What people should probably do is just panic sell, then they can kick themselves later and try to remember how they felt when they sold, and try to overcome the "panic" and anxiety next time. It's an expensive lesson, but it works. 
Hands up if you learned the same way as I did? :D

That's completely true. The market cap is a barometer for how volatile an asset (stock, currency, etc.) will be. Even the CAD moving a few cents is more than most Bitcoin volatility in terms of actual purchasing power.

The calculator wouldn't be able to handle Apple, or Facebook, but could barely manage Microsoft.
In November 2008, APPL was at about $13.25 or so. It's currently at about $97.50, which is around a 28% annual increase. 
In the same time period, MSFT has delivered about a 15% return. 
Since it's IPO, Facebook has delivered about 45%. 
And that's not even looking at any penny stocks where hundreds or thousands of % aren't uncommon/unheard of. 
They're out there. The incredulity that Bitcoin could double its price in a year is simply ill-founded. Other stocks have similar performance. 
EDIT: Corrected a stat.

In the same time period (last 8 years), the Down Jones Index has delivered 12%. The S&amp;P 500 Index is similar over the past 5 years. 
Yes, Bitcoin is a risk, but the incredulity of the rise of Bitcoin simply isn't justified when the **basic averages of the stock market indices** is sitting around 12%. And the calculator maxes out at 20%? 
Any fund manager not getting 12% needs to get fired. If you can't beat the index, just... wow.

If you buy now, it will drop for a while, and you'll feel bad. You can either wait until it goes up, in which case you'll be very happy, or sell at a loss while feeling bad, then wait for it to go up and feel bad even more. 
The halvening is coming up soon, so the new coin supply will drop in half. That will put upwards pressure on prices.

Buying that much BTC is still rather difficult to do. You need to accumulate as there aren't sellers out there that will sell that much. (Or not easy to find them.) But even if it is a small amount for them, it's still "dipping your toes in the water".

Bitcoin mining cannot be done on general purpose computers, such as Windows or OS X machines. 
It can only be done on dedicated computers with special ASIC chips - Application Specific Integrated Circuits. 
Research "Bitcoin mining" and you'll find out more. 
Or just don't bother and save yourself the time. You'll need a LOT of money to get into Bitcoin mining. Thousands to start at the most basic level...

I've been running a full node for about 3 years now. It's not caused me any problems at all. It takes up a bit of bandwidth, but nothing to complain about.

That's kind of right, and kind of wrong. 
What will happen in the "cashless" bank run is that people will simply purchase large ticket items that can hold their value. Obviously gold and silver are 2 of the best, but those aside, people will purchase jewelry, cars, household appliances, large amounts of food that keeps well (e.g. tinned food), ammunition, or just about whatever they think they'll be able to sell or trade for. 
Businesses will purchase (stockpile) stock/inventory, e.g. a metal working shop purchasing metal, oil, machinery, etc. 
In that situation, there will be instantaneous inflation. Recognising the "run", stores/merchants/sellers/manufacturers will raise prices. How fast and how high they rise? Dunno. But that's what will happen. 
There will still be "runs", but the nature of them will change. 
I think that the "cashless" runs will actually be more destructive as they will cause inflation that you wouldn't see in a normal bank run. Some sellers will eventually simply refuse to sell as the value of their products will go up more with them simply sitting on their inventories. They'll wait out or do some kind of dollar/cost averaging and sell slowly over time as inflation kicks in. That "holding back" will contribute to further inflation though, so it's a damned vs. damned situation.

Contact domob. He's one of the Namecoin and Huntercoin developers. He's been working on some things that could really benefit Bitcoin. Specifically, blockchain pruning. It may not sound like a big deal, but, well... look into it for yourself to understand it. 
You can find him in the Huntercoin forums here:
Register and PM him. 
To give a bit of background/info, the Huntercoin blockchain is like the Bitcoin blockchain on steroids. It's massive. Cutting that down to size for regular users is a major advancement. 
Namecoin is the first Bitcoin fork, and Huntercoin is the only Namecoin fork.

The other thing to remember is that different exchanges have different volumes. A very small exchange could see a spike like that from a much smaller volume, while the same volume on a larger exchange could result in almost no movement. That then gets to the "depth" issue.

Ah... ok. That makes a bit more sense now. 
Here's a set of alternate titles in English that might fit the "feel" better:
* Bitcoin purchases shifting mainstream?
* Are Bitcoin purchases shifting to the mainstream?
* Is Bitcoin going mainstream?
* Bitcoin: From dark web to main street
* From drugs to stocks &amp; consumer products
But, those are just a few suggestions that you can play with. I may have missed there, but those are a few ideas anyways. 
Getting the "feel" in translations can be rough. 
Do look into remittances though. That's a big market for Bitcoin, and it's just starting to get rolling. Andreas Antonopolous is the  source for info on that.

Different sites configure their paywalls differently.

As for priority, she doesn't need any priority with Bitcoin -- the network takes care of that already. And we've already established that she can't affect the network in a sane manner.

I doubt that would work. The exchanges often require KYC info and follow AML, so you have to register accounts. You'd need to send the BTC, sell, send to your bank account, then send from your bank account to the other bank account. 
However, different institutions act differently, so who knows?

Andreas is pretty much the only source you need, but others can add new perspectives. 
Check out Jeff Berwick for a rougher, passionate take on Bitcoin. (The Dollar Vigilante and Anarchast) 
Peter Schiff doesn't really like Bitcoin, but he accepts it. His perspective is worth understanding. 
Alex Jones isn't a Bitcoin fan, but he started accepting it as well. His position is similar to Peter Schiff's. 
Check out James Corbett's interview with Roger Ver here: 
For information on money, Bill Still is a good resource. Check out his documentaries and Youtube channel. 


I've not mentioned specifically conference videos above, but only content that is interesting or solid. 
For conference videos... it's hard to beat Andreas. He's simply charming. 
If you're looking for presentation skills, don't focus too much on Bitcoin presenters. 
Mises.org has a truckload of presentations available online on their Youtube channel. I'd recommend looking into Tom Woods as he's simply a bloody brilliant, stellar presenter. He has charisma out the wahoo. Also, he does talk about Bitcoin from time to time. 
Jeffrey Tucker... Must see. He's charismatic, intelligent, well spoken... Any conference video from him will do. 
For a rougher, more rugged, in-your-face kind of presenter, check out Larken Rose. There are many presentations with him out there, and he does talk about Bitcoin a bit. You can think of Larken as a "tough guy" compared to Jeff Berwick's style which is more "hippie" or "happy go lucky" or mellow, but not a bit less intense. 
Jeff Deist! Again, a great presenter. He talks about Bitcoin sometimes as well. 
Lew Rockwell! This is your go-to guy for hard core, solid information and devastating arguments. He's a bit dryer than Larken or Tom or Jeff or Jeff, but he delivers the goods. 
Anyways, I hope that those don't overwhelm you, and that I've provided enough descriptions to help you choose the style of presentation that you want. 
Personally, I think Tom Woods has the most effective style as he's very positive, uplifting, and energetic.

Yup. The purchasing power of a dollar has fallen by about 2 orders of magnitude in the last 100 years, with that accelerating. It's reasonable to assume that with accelerating declines in purchasing power, rather than a linear 100 * 100 (10,000) or 4 orders of magnitude, we might see far more. 8 orders of magnitude isn't an impossibility as that's only an acceleration factor of 2. 200 years is a long time. :)

I visited the Korbit office a couple months ago. It's fairly large with quite a few people in there. I suppose that should be some kind of indicator of its backers having a good deal of faith in Bitcoin in Korea. 
Also, there's no arbitrage opportunity on the Korbit exchange, which is a good sign. 
I'd like to see Naver, Daum, Bluehole Studios, Gamevil, Hangame, ESTsoft, NCSOFT, and a few more turn on to Bitcoin. 
When a few companies (or key influencers) in Korea hook into trends, it can very quickly explode nationwide. I think if NCSOFT started using Bitcoin, the rest of the gaming industry there would very quickly follow.

Fair enough.


No. Doesn't happen. It doesn't work that way. 
The amount of mining power for Bitcoin is **MASSIVE**. You cannot try to buy up that amount of power without it being noticed. Which gives people time to react...
Also, the major mining companies that she'd be buying into are merely pools that aggregate mining power. Miners would see what is happening, and pull out. She'd end up with assets worth nothing. 
And if she could get an attack in, it would stop there. It would be noticed and people would pull out. 
You can't just buy up 51% of the mining industry. It's made up of many, many players, and all of which have an interest in keeping Bitcoin alive. 
The only way for that to realistically happen is for a state actor (a country) to (in secret) set up factories and manufacture the infrastructure then dump all that mining power on the network at once. However, that is an insane amount of money to spend. It's very far from practical. If you can afford to spend that much, you'd profit much more from actually mining and participating in the network -- and **THIS** is one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin. 
There are miners on this forum that can explain it far better than I can. But that's a quick version of why a 51% attack isn't going to happen. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:27:01

Was just a tad long. He's just not willing to give a [charitable read]( 
Or he doesn't understand the Bitcoin ecosystem at all. 
One of the two. I don't know which. 
The fact remains that using a cryptographically secure system that eliminates the idiocy of having to show up in person to put ink on paper is still far better than the primitive systems currently in use. 
With Bitcoin, I have absolute proof and nothing else matters. 
In the current system, they need red tape because the system simply blows donkey balls. 
This isn't particularly difficult to understand for anyone that has actually taken the time to figure out the basics of cryptography and some of what strong cryptography implies.

Why would it be overvalued? The Bernankoin is based on the same principles from Nobel Prize winning economists that world governments and central banks use. It **MUST** therefore be superior to Bitcoins in every aspect. 
No. The true value of the Bernankoin is par value with the USD. 


This is entirely possible. If they were smart, they'd outlaw all crypto currencies except for the Bernankoin. 
Only lolbertarians can possibly look at the increasing levels of people on food stamps and conclude that people are getting poorer. That's just stupid. Look at the stock markets! They're up! Therefore everything is just grand and wonderful! 
The sooner Bitcoins are banned and replaced with Bernankoins, the better. Everyone will revel in the prosperity brought about by the sound economic and monetary principles espoused by such revered demi-gods as Keynes, Krugman, and, our namesake saviour, Bernanke. 
To the printing presses! We must save the economy!

True. The problem where I am is that it's still not that easy to buy bitcoins as there is no local exchange. So, in order to transact in bitcoins, I've got to wire money internationally, making it not worthwhile. 
But, yet again, that's just another illustration of how bitcoins are far superior to fiat when you want to send money somewhere. $20~40 in fees vs. $0.02. No brainer.

You need to be able to predict where the prices will be higher/lower several days in advance, then wire money there, wait, buy, send the bitcoin to the other exchange, then trade, then wire the money out, wait for it to arrive, rinse, repeat. Not really a very easy thing to do.

Fiat means "let it be so" or "by decree". Governments force pieces of paper to have value by decree. Those pieces of paper otherwise are only good for burning as they're simply too small and hard to wipe your ass with. 
Bitcoins have no such decree. It is the voices of everyone that participates in the bitcoin ecosystem that gives bitcoins its value. 
If you want to twist the traditional meaning of "fiat", then you could say that bitcoin is "democratic fiat". However, that is kind of an idiotic way to look at it as all things have subjective value, e.g. paintings by famous artists, gold, diamonds, art, etc. You're eventually then going down the path of calling everything "democratic fiat", which is kind of absurd as it dilutes the meaning of "fiat". Language dilution is another topic though. :)

No. I'm not sure what you mean there. Perhaps we're already on the same page, and the "trick" eluded me.


That's what I was driving at. Central planing always fails. Central planing is analogous to collectivism, and distributed systems is analogous to individualism. 
I didn't want to say that directly though. I was trying to drive that point home there for other readers to realise. I know I don't need to convince you. But there are other people out there that don't understand these principles. 
And again, like you've stated - these are truths that are independent of either of us. What we believe is irrelevant. Facts are facts. You don't get to destroy reality with your own opinions.

True. But what about online wallets? Will we see BTC banking? And then there's always "we're going to throw you in prison unless you cough up".

Get something like Keepass and store your password in there. Make certain to have your Keepass password safe though, or you'll be in the same predicament. Likely storing it on a piece of paper in your wallet could work as long as you don't leave instructions on what it is, e.g. on the back of a photo of a family member, etc. Lots of ways to write down passwords relatively safely. 
But, using something like Keepass helps as you only need to remember 1 password then. The thing is, you have to back up your Keepass database religiously just as you do for your wallet. A USB hub with several USB memory sticks is a good start.

I thought about it and what it would take to actually make it work, but it requires too much capital. 
You have to have BTC and fiat on hand in each exchange with enough to last you a few days while you send fiat through the banking system, which is sssssllllloooooww 
If you run out of BTC/fiat in an exchange, you're then stuck until bank transfers get through.
Now, there are other ways to get money around other than banks, but 6-of-1 -- you're still dealing with bank deposits and dealing with extra time. 
You also have to make sure that you're incorporating exchange and wire fees into how you work,  so that means larger money transfers are more profitable. If it's more than $10k USD, then you're a terrorist and hate puppies. etc. etc. 
It's not a poor-man's game.

Bitcoins are unique. Other currencies are simply pulled out of the asses of private banks ad infinitum. The market cap on them is impossible to calculate because the amount can never be known. 
1) Market cap = amount of currency * price
2) Price = market cap / amount of currency
From this we can see that the price of fiat is zero because any finite number divided by an infinite number is zero (for practical purposes and not for theoretical mathematics). 
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:43:41


Kind of makes me wonder why you're so angry then. 


Name a country? How about a continent? Asia. All over Asia you can find many examples of people who don't need the government to coddle them like scared little children. It seems there are far more adults in the third world than in the first world. 
If you've ever been to Asia and taken the time to look around, you'll have seen it already. 
Since freer trade has opened up with Asia, poverty has declined massively and well ahead of projected targets. It wasn't laws or regulations that have helped people lift themselves up - it's been the determination of people to better themselves with access to freer markets. 
You only need to open your eyes and look for examples. They are everywhere. 
Or, conversely, have a look at Washington D.C. and the taxi industry and how it is being usurped by startup companies that help people get rides around through simple mobile applications. Again you'll see how a freer market with mobile applications beats a heavily regulated industry that relies on regulations to exclude competition. 
Examples are right in your backyard. You have only to look for them.

I program, and I can tell you right now that anything done will be out of date in a while and will need to be redone. (Lots of programmers will do this so that they get repeat business.)
What you want is a script that pulls in data that **YOU** create and outputs profitability. That way you can update it as time goes on without needing it to be reprogrammed. 


That's not reasonable. There are simply too many variations out there and too many variations that do not have complete specs. It's not going to happen. You'll need to settle for a "best effort". Nobody is going to compile a database of thousands of cards.
Check here for some more info:
There are many, many cards out there. Some cards aren't even listed on their manufacturer's site. You're asking for an impossible task. "All" cards and ASICs isn't possible.

Look at how insanely stupidly difficult it is for a lot of people to buy bitcoins because they need to deal with the banking system. 
Look at how you got screwed out of getting your $120 BTC because of the banking system. 
Ask people how easy it is to use bitcoins... 
That's enough reason to get on board the bitcoin rocket and say goodbye to the antiquated, slow, unreliable fiat banking system. 
Well, that and bitcoins are only going to go up. So, you can ask yourself whether it's better to buy at $1,000 or in a couple months (or whenever) whether you should buy at $2,000 (or whatever). 
There are enough bitcoins for everyone to have 0.003 BTC. Today you can buy 0.003 BTC for about $3. How long will it stay like that?

The moment 1 major retailer adopts bitcoins, there will be an avalanche of the rest following suit. But this will take some time. I'd say end of 2014 or 2015 maybe. 
We'll see a few small or bitcoin related companies paying employees in bitcoins, but we won't see broad bitcoin payment for employees for quite a while. However, once we see some more mainstream companies paying employees in bitcoins, the price of bitcoins will be astronomical. This is the main thing to watch for in the future - people being paid in bitcoins. Once that happens, everyone will accept bitcoins as payment. Any "hold outs" in the retail or commercial sectors will hop on board then. 
What will be interesting is to see which of the retail or commercial/industrial sectors adopt bitcoins faster. Bitcoins are a massive improvement for a payment system over LCs and the like. So, we could see suppliers asking for bitcoins or importers looking to pay in bitcoins. If bitcoins are used in trade like this, that economy will spread bitcoins throughout the rest of the industrial sectors. I'd expect to see a cascading effect there, albeit slowly.

Oh fuck no! The long transfer times are an artifact of the banking system. I could get into some gory details, but suffice it to say that every time you transfer money, it goes through a few systems and a few banks take their cut. That takes time... because... 
They also use that time (called the 'float time') to abuse your money and use it for interest. The longer a transfer takes, the more money they make. 
The reality is that all your transfers could be instantaneous. If you look at banking in South Korea, bank transfers are quite literally in real time. That doesn't happen in the west because western banks are far more interested in raping you than serving you.

What you outlined above is one level of regulation, but we also currently have actual regulations being passed for what can or cannot be produced/farmed. e.g. How certain breeds of pigs are being exterminated in Michigan, etc. Again, it all goes back to regulating people, but there seems to be something there nagging at the back of my mind about the relative invasiveness of different regulations.

That was a LOT easier to read. ;)
But honestly, a 40 character password like that is pretty darn hard to remember. Mashing 2 of your favourite quotes is easier and can give you an arbitrary length. e.g. Take a verse out of the King James Bible and a modern quote. Here's a simple example:
First Samuel 8:11 concatenated with a JFK quote:
And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. The best road to progress is freedom's road.
Now, that's actually still a bit poor, but you could interweave the text with 1 word from the first quote then another from the second quote, etc. 
That then limits how much you need to remember but still gives you an enormously large password. 
If you forget that password, but remember enough information, you can still brute force it. e.g. You remember that you used a KJV First Samuel verse with a short JFK freedom quote. 
But brute forcing a 40 character random password... not so easy. 
That whole thing goes back to the random password vs. pass phrase debate. There are good arguments on both sides. I happen to be partial to crazy long pass phrases for some kinds of passwords. Pass phrases are completely unsuitable for a lot of web sites though as many web sites limit the number of characters you can use to a very small number, e.g. 12 or 20. I've seen web sites that limit password lengths to 8, and even 6! :O
I do like the way you have the wallets serialized there though. That adds a very nice bit of meaningful information.

The RCM is a money grubbing scam. Just have a look at their site. Read through the BS they vomit out in the descriptions of their massively overpriced baubles. 
The only thing remotely worth buying from the RCM site is the $20 for $20 coin. Everything else is hype, except if you're a numismatic freak. 
The RCM doesn't even sell any RCM bullion, e.g. the Maple Leaf gold/silver coin, etc. They don't even sell the 1.5 ozt Polar Bears there. 
MintChip is a dismal failure from an organization that wants to remain relevant, but simply can't due to their nature. Having the RCM come up with a sane crypto-currency is like asking a leopard to go vegan while it changes its spots. 
They've entirely missed the point that decentralization is a good thing.

Supporting logic in 6 parts:

[Part 4 - Run on the Banks? Or Run on the People?](
[Part 5 – Compound Interest as Invisible Slavery](
[Part 6 – Summary &amp; Additional Resources](
Have a read. Part 3 is probably the most important as it illustrates the fraud most clearly. Bitcoin is built on mathematics - not fraud. They are not compatible. Cryptography &amp; numbers do not lie.

I hate to hear that, and it sucks to hear that you got slammed there.
For any computer that you do any kind of monetary transaction on, or use any accounts related to monetary transactions, e.g. email, you really need to harden them some and be very careful about what you click on. 
Chances are that you got hit by a keylogger that stole your password and ID. That then allowed the attacker to steal your BTC. It is far less likely that the attacker guessed your password through a brute force attack at MtGox. 
I've written brute force attack programs in the past, and over the network like that (for administrators, not criminal behaviour like this), they are far less likely to succeed unless you have a very weak password. 
For the network (Chinanet Jiangxi Province Network), my guess is that it's just a distraction from a zombie or proxy. 
I hope that you can recover from the loss quickly. :(

I really have little sympathy for people that just download whatever if it's "free" and then complain. 
There is no "free" with most of these. People need to understand the licenses before they use them. Look for GPL software instead. 
And if you don't like the license, then don't use the software. It's really pretty simple. There are replacements for most software out there, and there are commercial versions that don't do nasty things like that. 
If you're using Microsoft or Apple or Google software, you're already being raped, even if you don't know it. 
Reading licenses is a real pain in the butt. I hate it. Quite often I don't read them. But I've also got enough experience to know when something is fishy, and I install very, very little software, and then I only install software that I know I can trust.

Another thing to think about is how a large part of the world counts in Chinese (not just the Chinese - the Chinese number system is broadly used), and you count saying things like "five thousand ten thousands" (50,000,000). So that sort of mixing units isn't really all that strange.

If I want service X, I'll simply pay for it. But forcing me to pay for things I don't want is simply racketeering. 


And that's the extent of the logic of people that support taxation - you people always end up resorting to name calling and blatant logical fallacies. There is no reasoning with you. No logic. No sane argument. Go directly to logical-fallacy-land. Do not pass Go. Do not collect basic textbook on logic in order to create valid arguments. 
Here's a simple example: Is it possible for you to open up a restaurant and sell alcohol without a license? Of course it is. So why do you need to allow government to rob you of your money to create and enforce laws that serve no peaceful purpose?

A friend of mine sold off all his bitcoins a while back. 2 weeks ago he pulled out his old wallet.dat, checked, and saw 0.043 BTC in it. He's traded it up to 10x that now. In 2 weeks. I wish I could manage that. He's reading the exchange he trades on, and dealing in a few crypto-currencies. 
At the moment, I'm just reading up on trading to educate myself more. I've probably lost more BTC doing stupid trades than most people will see in their lifetime. 
Day trading is very possible. People do it. I figure that if I set a budget, I can play with a low amount of bitcoins until I at least double it, then work up to slowly larger amounts.

The most important thing (for me) is that we simply have the FREEDOM to do what we want with what belongs to us. 
You may want a bank safety deposit box. I may want a pack of hungry hunting dogs with a taste for blood surrounding a 15 cm thick steel safe in my basement kennel/panic room. Both are perfectly fine. Though I imagine there will be some good innovation coming along so that you don't need to go to the bank and I don't need to feed a pack of dogs. :)

Some coins are novel in some ways, and some are just scams. 
NMC is good. It's like a decentralised DNS and a lot more. Very useful. 
XPM does some funky prime number math that is useful for mathematicians. It actually does have a purpose, though somewhat esoteric for most people.

I used bitcoins to develop a secret formula that gives me the super-power of not shitting my pants when bitcoin rises spectacularly.

Getting the difficulty isn't a problem. The problem is the database. Even with that list you posted (which is fantastic), it will be out of date in 6 months with new cards released, etc. etc. 
But the list above only further illustrates how futile it is to be exhaustive. It's not just the chipset, but the manufacturer, etc. etc. 
It's more practical to look at a general range for a chipset and output based on that. You'll never actually be correct in any given calculations anyways, so building in a certain level of margin of error is a better approach. e.g. Difficulty will increase, but you don't know the rate that it will increase at, so you've got a stochastic variable there and no way to truly be accurate. You can only give a "best efforts" calculation and state your assumptions along with the results. e.g. We expect a 10% per month increase in difficulty, blah blah whatever. 
There is no perfect solution to this problem. We are talking about stochastic variables, and so you're left with dealing with a margin of error and assumptions. 
The database doesn't need to be perfect. A better approach is to go for a slick UI that is fun and easy to use. e.g. My range idea above could be spiced up with a jQuery slider and a readout that updates with the names of different cards, etc. All of a sudden, you're not really trying to be "accurate", but you're trying to make the whole deal a bit more fun and entertaining for the user while they're getting some valuable information. 
Blah... I'm actually working on a similar problem at the moment, though I am not looking to program it into a web site first, but rather program a desktop client for myself to use for mining and trading. I'm just framing the problems for myself at the moment.

I'm not so sure that BTC will "stabilize" for a LOONNNGGG time. 
Increased adoption of BTC will continue to drive the price up. Scarcity will prevent it from dropping. 
The rate of BTC entering the market will affect the price, but if it trickles in with difficulty factor increasing, the effects are likely to be minimal or largely unnoticed. 
a) With increased adoption, and a slower rate of increase, I think more people will be willing to spend BTC. Also, people that are "all in" will have to spend BTC. 
b) Not sure. I think it all depends where they are being spent. 
c) My guess is yes. 
d) No. We'd be better off without usury entirely. Let that remain the domain of other currencies. 
“Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes the nations laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognised as its most sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.”  ― William Lyon Mackenzie King

Nope. No such things as roads before taxes. No roads in North America prior to 1913. In fact, taxes also provide water infrastructure, and there was no water prior to 1913 either. Back then, people had to grind stones to get their water. Life was hard, because there were no roads to go out and gather stones for water.
Shall we go on? 
Tax is theft.

Just one question for you: How do you reconcile the fraud of abusing float time with bitcoin where there can be no float time? 
I didn't read anything else on your blog though, so I couldn't comment. (Didn't know it was yours.) I didn't like that specific article though. (Well, I hated it, as you can tell.) You're far too willing to go down a very dark path there. (Yes - I'm rabidly against FRB and have been for decades.)

The litecoin client has an integrated miner. 
As for possible for BTC, sure. Anything is possible. But there are already miners out there. I'm sure the devs have better things to do and that their time is better spent elsewhere. 
Check out BitMoose. It's got a GUI, a few options in it, and is pretty easy to use. 
For the BTC client as it is, since it needs to sync with the network, I think that's sufficient to convince people to keep it open.

I know what you're saying. People don't read. They don't follow directions well. I don't think that's going to change. 
From my reading of a lot of these posts, I get the sense that a lot of people are confused and scared. They see the next big thing, but... They're trying to step out of their comfort zone and just can't manage to do it quite yet. 
A flat page isn't going to help them. They need personal contact. They need to say, "this here is my situation exactly... what do you think?"
So, even if they did read an FAQ, I think the emotional side of it all is something that just can't be addressed through research.

I think bitcoins could really do a lot of good for people in India. Heck, India could become the next China and drive bitcoins up even further and drive greater adoption, and perhaps even spark employers to start paying in BTC. 
I'm hoping that somebody gets on top of it. I would love to, but I just don't have the capital to do it. I have a lot of the skills, but not the amount of money I'd need to do it... SOMEBODY is going to make a fortune by getting the ball rolling in India.

I'm currently working with the API. What would really help is if you could post some additional sample code and "lorem ipsum" transaction results for different scenarios.
What you have right now is "ok". It's all highly polished, but it's thin on actual content. As a developer, I don't care so much about the polish as I care more about sample code and easily understandable explanations. 
A developer oriented blog would be a cheap and easy way for you to simply quickly write things up on the fly and publish. Wikis are more focused, and might be a bit harder to "get to", depending on how you work. (They're also not really open for "comments".) 
If you have a look over at how Samsung handles developer relations (I do a lot of work for them in this field), you'll see that they have a very strong focus on developer education. This is THE key to increase developer adoption. 
The issue is that you have developers that just don't want to read through a dry API that has little documentation and figure out what everything does by pouring through source code. Been there - done that - not fun. 
Blog posts with sample code lets you communicate with developers on a much more intimate level where you on only get the information out there, but you get developers interacting with you. This creates an emotional attachment, etc. etc. etc. I'm blathering on about developer evangelism...

Well, I really hate to disagree... but I think you're simply being too reasonable and sane. I don't for a moment think that there's a speck of sanity in Ottawa, and I don't think they will ever stop trying to siphon off as much of your labour and wealth as they possibly can.
Imagine this... You get a tax form and on it they've added some new fields where you are required to enter any crypto-currency you own, etc. etc. It's a "crime" to "lie" to them. 
Now imagine you're in a store that accepts bitcoins and you pay in BTC. A surveillance camera takes a snapshot of your face and ties you to your tax form. The police show up and things don't end well. 
The potential is there. Whether it happens or not is another matter. If BTC transactions ever become popular, I'm quite certain that the likelihood for what I described above would rapidly climb towards 1.

Localbitcoins.com or cavirtex.com or vaultofsatoshi.com will get you BTC locally. 
All the exchanges seem to require info and verification in order to wire money there, but I've not checked that for BTCChina.com or BTC-e. 
Likely localbitcoins.com can get you your BTC fastest. 
However, you might want to try emailing the people at Vault of Satoshi - their customer service is stellar from what I've seen. They will likely help you and authorise you very quickly. You can then likely do a direct deposit and rush things. However, do call them up first or email them. They're in Brantford, Ontario.

That's actually not true anymore - even unconnected systems could be vulnerable. There was a recent article at Ars Technica on the topic. There are other methods too. Some have been presented at Black Hat. 
Here's the Ars Technica article:
But, other than flat out black hat techniques, bitcoin cannot be "regulated" by government. How would they ever manage to explain the need to mandate that all computers have rootkits, etc? That's a bit of a stretch, even with our out of control police states (right now that is - things could change).

Easiest way is to buy it with bitcoins on an exchange like Cryptsy or BTC-e. There are others as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:23:06
Well, if you're flipping between BTC and ???, it doesn't really matter what currency it's in. One is as good as another as long as you end up in BTC. 
But, if you're initially buying or looking to cash out, yeah - maybe not so great. I've not checked what banks they support or about wire transfers. Sending BTC works much easier. :) 
Then again, if you can buy BTC somewhere, then it's good to trade there. e.g. Buy at Vault of Satoshi, then flip it back and forth at BTC China to scoop up a few extra mBTC or BTC.

Not really. 
You want to keep bitcoins, right?
So you take ALL your money and put it in bitcoins.
Now you're hungry and need to eat... Spend bitcoins? :)
It makes sense to buy and hold as much as possible. This makes bitcoins like gold and precious metals - a store of value - but still far more liquid. But the real benefit is in bitcoins being deflationary - you have more purchasing power later on - so you save X amount now, and you get to spend X + Y% more later. 
Where I live it's not that easy to buy bitcoins, and there are no local shops that accept it. But if I could spend bitcoins instead of fiat, I'd put every cent I had in bitcoins and be done with fiat entirely. We're not there yet - but we're getting closer with more and more merchants accepting BTC and more people using it.

My guess is that this is still the beginning. It's probably better to think of the price of bitcoins in terms of orders of magnitude. It goes up by 1 order of magnitude every 9~10 months or so. That doesn't mean it will continue that way, but that's been the pattern so far. 
So, at the moment, you can buy bitcoins for 3 figures. Next year, probably 4 figures. The year after? Maybe 5 figures. Who knows? It might slow down, or adoption may increase and it may accelerate. 
More merchants accepting it will help bitcoin, but that's not the real thing that will accelerate bitcoins - people getting paid in bitcoins will entrench it. With people being paid that way, merchants will be forced to accept bitcoins. The more people paid in BTC, the more merchants will take it. 
The thing there is that people spend what they are paid. Their pay goes directly to groceries, gas, bills, etc. 
So, while people complain about people hoarding bitcoins, that's just people saving, and that will decrease as people begin accepting bitcoins as a part of their regular salary/wage. 
**BRAIN FART:** That would be a good way for the FBI to get rid of their stolen bitcoins - pay them out to government employees.

I like a lot of what he's got to say there, and he's definitely pointed in the right direction. 
It might be difficult to be creative enough to eliminate taxation theft, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. It just means work. 
There's nothing wrong with paying for things you use. But there is something very wrong in being forced to pay for things whether you use them or not. 
It's impossible to have a moral system with violence, coercion, fraud and theft as it's foundation. No system that coerces people has any legitimate authority. 
I think he needs to go further in that article. Good start though. :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:07:38

While I don't think it would eradicate gangs, it would certainly help to chip away at one of their revenue bases. The more it was used, the more it would chip away. 
But I think you'd find gangs just going into other businesses, e.g. hijacking transport trucks, etc. 
For decreasing prison populations... I'm sure that the Police State would find other things to throw people in prison for, like, oh, maybe pure milk or growing tomatoes or competing with big agra. Oops... They're already doing that...

Here's an article I wrote where the most important thing is float time:
It's part 3 in a series of 6 articles. 
In that article I walk through how float time is open to abuse and can be used for fraudulent purposes. 
The important part to understand about it is how it acts to store energy during its abuse. This is a critical part of the world financial system, and nobody ever mentions it. 
For a lot of online trading, float times are near irrelevant. 
When you start looking at lag times, then the non-fraudulent aspects of how it is important become apparent, though that's an entirely different topic than I go over in that article.  
Other things to look for with float time are how overnight lending rates abuse people's money. Again, this is abusing float times, etc. etc. 
As a side note, float times in online banking differ in different countries. In South Korea they are non-existent as transactions are pretty much in real time. Canada or the US? Not so much. 2~5 days to send money? Sigh...

This is very slow. The biggest problem I see there is that once you actually understand FRB and just how sinister it is, the implications are simply terrifying. This causes some people to simply reject what is blatantly obvious - that FRB is fraud. It's fun talking to economists and finance PhDs about these things. They're very often completely oblivious to what's right in front of them. 
This is my own take on FRB in 6 parts:
[Part 1 – The Mechanics of Fractional Reserve Banking](
[Part 2 – What is Money?](
[Part 3 – “How” Fractional Reserve Banking Creates Money and “Why” it is Fraudulent](
[Part 4 - Run on the Banks? Or Run on the People?](
[Part 5 – Compound Interest as Invisible Slavery](
[Part 6 – Summary &amp; Additional Resources](
A lot of the stuff there is nothing new, but I have added some new things to the topic, which are mostly in Part 3. There I walk through exactly **WHY** and **HOW** FRB is fraud, which I've not read elsewhere. 
While some parts are a bit longer, I've tried to boil things down in to an easier way for people to understand FRB.

Wikipedia articles are anything but from a neutral point of view. You can go through the talk pages and find time after time massive disputes on exactly that issue. The resolution, almost without fail, is to rather than actually have a NPOV, side with mainstream propaganda. Popular lies are better than inconvenient truths at Wikipedia. The only way that gets solved is through "brigading" where so many people edit and participate in the talk pages that it's no longer possible to marginalize ideas. 
I used to donate to Wikipedia. When I started noticing the large number of skewed articles, that stopped.

US banks warn Fed interest cut could force them to charge depositors
By Tom Braithwaite and Stephen Foley in New York and Robin Harding in Washington
Leading US banks have warned that they could start charging companies and consumers for deposits if the US Federal Reserve cuts the interest it pays on bank reserves.
Depositors already have to cope with near-zero interest rates, but paying just to leave money in the bank would be highly unusual and unwelcome for companies and households.
The warning by bank executives highlights the dangers of one strategy the Fed could use to offset an eventual “tapering” of the $85bn a month in asset purchases that have fuelled global financial markets for the last year.
Minutes of the Fed’s October meeting published last week showed it was heading towards a taper in the coming months – perhaps as soon as December – but wants to find a different way to add stimulus at the same time. “Most” officials thought a cut in the interest on bank reserves was an option worth considering.
Executives at two of the top five US banks said a cut in the 0.25 per cent rate of interest on the $2.4tn in reserves they hold at the Fed would lead them to pass on the cost to depositors.
Banks say they may have to charge because taking in deposits is not free: they have to pay premiums of a few basis points to a US government insurance programme.
“Right now you can at least break even from a revenue perspective,” said one executive, adding that a rate cut by the Fed “would turn it into negative revenue – banks would be disincentivised to take deposits and potentially charge for them”.
Other bankers said that a move to negative rates would not only trim margins but could backfire for banks and the system as a whole, as it would incentivise treasury managers to find higher-yielding, riskier assets.
“It’s not as if we are suddenly going to start lending to [small and medium-sized enterprises],” said one. “There really isn’t the level of demand, so the danger is that banks are pushed into riskier assets to find yield.”
The danger of negative rates has deterred the Fed from cutting interest on bank reserves in the past. If it were to do so now, it would most probably expand a new facility that lets banks and money market funds deposit cash at a small, positive interest rate. That should avoid any need for banks to charge depositors.
About half of the reserves come from non-US banks that do not have to pay the deposit insurance fee. Their favourite manoeuvre is to take deposits from money market funds and park them overnight at the Fed, earning millions of dollars risk-free. Cutting the interest on reserves would stop that.
Lowering interest on reserves would also affect money market funds, said Alex Roever, head of US interest rate strategy at JPMorgan.
“[It] would decrease the incentive for those banks to borrow in the money markets, which in turn could leave money market funds short of certain investments and force them to bid up the price of their next best options,” he said.
Richard Gilhooly, strategist at TD Securities, highlighted some benefits to the Fed from the possible cut: “[It] would not only anchor short-term rates near zero, it also stands to boost the profits for the Fed as they pay less interest to banks,” he said.

A bunch of people deposit fiat.
A bunch of people deposit bitcoins.
They all trade. 
The exchange takes a cut of the fiat and the bitcoins from each transaction. 
At any time the people can pull their money out of the exchange. 
The exchange runs off of the commissions they charge. 
No reason for less than 100% reserves, and every reason for more than 100% reserves. 
You're confusing a vendor service with an exchange.

worth of electricity per day,” meaning the cost of “producing one bitcoin is about $2.50.” With Bitcoins currently value at 100 times that, you can see why companies offering ‘mining’ equipment are doing such good business.
Wow. Such a wonderfully intelligent report and brilliant reporting! /s

Sorry - I think their only support page is that one. Try Google Translate. That should help.
Their support email address is just "support" at btcchina.com. They speak English, so you'll have no problems. 
As for funding accounts, I did it in BTC, so I can't comment on bank accounts.

Mining bitcoins won't get you anywhere. Mining other alt coins profitably takes time. If you can mine BTC with free electricity and/or hardware, then that's a maybe. 
Check out the reddit though. Lots of good info there. 
I know a guy who does some pretty heavy duty mining and he says to just forget it. Look into Cointerra - you'll see just how scary they are. Guys from major foundries and the like behind it. They're going to RIP up the market with some nasty equipment. Game over for everyone else out here in poorville. 
If I were you, I'd buy bitcoins as cheaply as possible, which would mean a local exchange to avoid international wiring fees. 
But, they're fairly liquid, and I'm a bit of a risk-taker, so I'd pour as much in as I possibly could and still have my bills paid. 
So, the question is how comfortable are you with risk, and do you have an emergency plan? e.g. A sibling that can help cover you for a couple weeks. 
Then again, it could all go to pot... risk risk risk... sigh... 
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:40:58

1. Tomorrow the value of your fiat will be less while the value of your bitcoins will be more.
2. 3% of the prices you pay go towards payment processors when using fiat systems. With bitcoins, it's almost nothing. 
3. They understand that  and  give them more purchasing power and that their money will go farther with bitcoins than with fiat. 
But, most people aren't rational and don't make logical decisions. So, who knows?

Perhaps a few entertaining examples might help. :D
The Internet is an illusion. It doesn't really exist. 
That's because ISPs are privately owned and run, and since the government doesn't run all the ISPs, we must be suffering from a mass delusion about this interwebs thingy. 
Now, finally that governments are taking over the medical industry, health care exists. It did not exist prior to that. Hypocrates is only an illusion. There were no doctors prior to socialized medicine. 
Only countries like China and North Korea have news, because the news there is run by the government. News does not exist elsewhere because it's not outrightly run by the government. 
Grocery stores are also an illusion. However, once we surrender the idea of food entirely to government, then food will become a reality and we can all eat. Aren't you hungry right now?
This entire "who will build the roads" thing is just idiotic. People build things. Government is just an inefficient tool to get things done in the most expensive way possible.

You're missing the point. Government overreach and the creation of a near infinite number of laws only creates crime rather than preventing it. Stop making everything illegal and POOF! Crime goes down. Most people in prison are not there because they did anything "bad" - they are there because of legislation. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:53:57
It seems to me that you have only pointed out that debt is bad. I agree. :) 
However, if transactions are measured in items, and not currency, the concern becomes moot. 
e.g. I "buy" a carton of eggs from you for 0.1 BTC today, but I want it on credit. You tell me that the price may change by the time I settle up. I say "ok". Next week, I come back, and settle up, and the price of a carton of eggs is 0.11 BTC, or perhaps 0.09 BTC. Either way, I still pay for the eggs. I'm not paying more or less BTC if you take the perspective that the price of eggs relative to BTC changed. 
It can work. It only depends on whether you're trapped inside the box, or whether you can think your way through it.

They would purchase quietly over time as much as possible. They would inject $1 billion into the market and the market cap would rise, though not necessarily by $1 billion - it could be more or less, though likely much more. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:23:39
It depends on what you mean by "stable". 
Bitcoin will only reach a relative stability in the distant future. Its deflationary effects will continue to dominate its value for quite some time.
In the distant future, if bitcoins achieve widespread adoption, they will become more stable and the volatility that you see will instead become market forces pushing prices down due to increased productivity.

2~3% is really high. Like, really, really high. 
But yes, you do take some risk. 
The way I look at it is that I have XXX in fiat and YYY in BTC. I will spend my QEternity fiat first and get rid of that crap debt-based shit. 
Fiat is fucking garbage. Ask Peter Schiff. :) All the gold bugs and silver bugs will tell you the same thing. (I own silver and gold as well.) 
But why not trade in fiat crap for bitcoins? Keep what you need in fiat for a few months of living, and get rid of the rest?
I have some amount of fiat for living because most of the merchants where I live do not accept bitcoins. At the moment... But that will change. More and more are taking BTC. 
So, for me? Fuck fiat. I want to put at much as possible in BTC and let the currency collapse leave me laughing. The currency collapse is coming. We had one in 1997 and 1998 in Asia. The Western currency collapse is coming... :( 
I lost a truckload of money (for me at the time) during the Asian currency crisis. Not going to let that happen again. 
For now, I'll keep bitcoins and spend them. Funnel fiat into BTC and let it appreciate. Spend it.
This is **ENTIRELY** about **purchasing power**.

Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins. It is impossible to introduce more than the currently mined amount. 
You can think about it like this... Imagine you're way back when the first bitcoins are being mined and you have 100% of the first 1,000 bitcoins mined. You lend them at 10% interest to a friend. (We'll ignore newly mined coins here.) Your friend comes back, gives you the original 1,000 bitcoins, but can't pay you the other 100 bitcoins because they don't exist. How does he resolve the payment? His only solution is to resolve the payment in another currency. 
Now, fast forward to today. The same holds true. However, there are far more bitcoins in circulation, and nobody has 100%. So, it is possible for interest resolution to be faked in bitcoins. What would happen is that resolution would be done in another currency, but prior to making the actual payment, that currency would be used to purchase bitcoins. This would add additional deflationary pressure on bitcoins as it would increase demand for them. On the surface, it might look like resolution is done in bitcoins, but that would be misleading. Resolution CANNOT be done in bitcoins. It MUST be done in another currency.

Take what you can spare and buy. Don't use money that you can't afford to hold on to for a while. That is, if you have $500 and have already budgeted $450 of that for bills and everything else, then use that $50. 
If you're a gambler, then maybe more... 
I don't know if we'll see the crash/correction some people are talking about. There are far too many people buying right now. If this continues, it will be a while before the BTC price starts to taper. By that time it might be over $1,000, and a 25% correction would be $750, which is still over $600 now.

But that's really no different than something like locking your car doors or whatever. It's just a different way to take care of a different asset type.

Here you go:
New UK Bitcoin exchange to bar US clients
By Stephen Foley in New York
A new Bitcoin exchange launching in London on Tuesday will bar customers from the US, citing diverging regulatory approaches to the experimental digital currency.
Coinfloor, which is being pitched by its founders as a forum for high-frequency trading in Bitcoin, will open initially only to customers in the UK and the rest of Europe.
At the same time, the Bitcoin Foundation, which acts as a US trade group for virtual currency businesses and advocates for Bitcoin, is planning to set up a non-US headquarters, to reflect the possibility that the centre of gravity for innovation will shift abroad.
Mark Lamb, founder of Coinfloor, said his company had ambitions to move into the US eventually, but “legally it is not safe to open up to US customers in the beginning”.
He added: “Partly because of regulation, we think there is a larger market in the UK and in Europe and then in Asia.”
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has told Coinfloor it does not plan to regulate its business, which will offer a way for customers to swap British pounds for Bitcoin, in competition to existing European exchanges Bitstamp and BTC-E.
The UK agency has been monitoring the growth of Bitcoin but has decided it is not widely used and therefore does not currently require formal regulation.
An anonymous computer scientist created Bitcoin in 2009 as an alternative to fiat currencies. Transactions are conducted through a peer-to-peer network of computers, outside the traditional banking system, and the number of “coins” in circulation is capped.
The value of a Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly as speculators have debated whether it could be widely used as a currency for goods and services. Last week, Fortress Investment Group’s Michael Novogratz became the most senior finance industry figure to admit buying Bitcoin, saying it might become a useful payment mechanism in emerging markets.
Coinfloor, which is based in the City of London, has received seed investment from Passion Capital, an angel investment firm led by Stefan Glaenzer, former chairman of online radio pioneer Last.fm and a founder of auction site Ricardo.de. Another backer is Taavet Hinrikus, an early employee at Skype.
The exchange goes live for customer registrations at 9am on Tuesday with trading expected to start a week later.
Passion did not reveal the sum it invested in Coinfloor, but said its average investment is £190m.
Bitcoin exchanges operating in the US are required to register with the US Treasury and to implement anti-money laundering checks. Most states also require money transmission licences, though few have set out policies regarding virtual currencies.
Banks have been nervous about working with US exchanges while regulation remains unclear, and several Bitcoin entrepreneurs have received subpoenas from state authorities asking for information about whether Bitcoin can be used for money laundering.
Peter Vessenes, founder of Seattle-based CoinLab and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, said that innovation could shift out of the US to other jurisdictions.
”The way the regulatory dance works in the US, I think you will see more innovation elsewhere,” he said. “It is harder here.”

Given how BTC is rising, I think you're better off simply buying rather than mining. If you want to invest in mining, just buy mining stocks. 
For day trading, look at BTC-e and BTC China.

They have made the argument that they can steal your savings though. The 2013 economy blah blah paper from Ottawa detailed this in how they plan on "bail-ins". 
So, it might not be too far of a stretch to see them try this later on with bitcoins. The cases are very different, but Ottawa has very sticky fingers. There is no low that they won't sink to.

Steak vs. hamburger is a bad example. What you're suggesting there is that CPI reflect falling living standards, which really defeats the purpose of the CPI. Pretty soon the CPI is zero because people fell from steak to hamburger to carrots to tree bark to starvation. i.e. If you build in a decreasing standard of living, you're debasing the CPI and things ain't gonna end well. :)

Yes, it's useful like that (similar to PayPal - though PP requires 1 extra step), but it's still a centralised system. That puts it within reach of the kleptocrats. That risk is either one you're willing to take or not. I'd much rather stay as far away from that risk as possible. Distributed is not decentralised. 


It seems a lot like Megacoin. Pre-mining stinks of being a scam.

True enough. While the 24/7/365 thing is nothing new, the relatively small size of the market and the unpredictability of people coming into or getting out of the market really throws a monkey wrench into a lot of traditional forex theory. 
I'm curious to know what some people are using for charting, e.g. Meta Trader 4, etc. 
Thanks for the response though. 
Seems like not too many people above feel like being helpful. Kind of a shame as in a lot of other communities people are extremely helpful.

1. A quantum computer capable of breaking bitcoin would destroy all encryption. Bitcoin would be your last worry. 
2. It's open source. At any time, anyone can fork it. The thing there is, who would accept the fork? Without a compelling reason, forks would be rejected by the community. 
3. Those problems are already solved. The protocol is secure. For GUI bugs, those are entirely unimportant as they do not affect the protocol unless someone is a complete retard. 
4. Anonymous banking is good. Fuck taxes. They're theft. Look into crypto-anarchy. 
5. There are no problems unless you're a statist bent on complete control. Bitcoin is about financial freedom. It is an extension of crypto-anarchism and meant to give you the ability to do with your money what you want to do without being raped by the state. 
Make no mistake - bitcoin has its birth in freedom and liberty. It is about giving you the choice to do what you believe is right without the iron fist of the state beating the shit out of you. If you want to pay taxes, and you believe that taxation is good, then you are free do to so. If you believe that tax is theft, and do not wish to support unlimited wars of aggression and imprisoning people for burning and inhaling flowers, then you are free to do so. 
Bitcoin is freedom. There is no problem with freedom for people that do not initiate violence against other people. The choice is then yours as to what you do with your freedom.

No. It doesn't work that way. They are used to printing money for nothing. Buying up BTC would only drive it up. They can't play the same game they're playing now with it. That scares them. Right now they control the money supply, which they can never do with bitcoins.

Head on over to and check it out there. That's probably the best resource around. You'll be pointed to pretty much every other good resource out there by reading there first. 
But don't bother mining BTC with what you have. Mine something else. 
I mined a bit of Philosophers Stones (PHS) and Primecoins (XPM) doing purely CPU mining and was more profitable than what you've described. e.g. I've been making what you did in 1 or 2 days. On old crappy hardware even. 
So, just try to pick something that will work for you.

Donated on day 1. :)
I think it will be much harder for them to do what you've outlined than is practical. They would have to force millions of people to start using new software, and in the meantime people could adopt a "counter-client" that actively destroyed whatever they were trying to accomplish. suggested a solution to the disaster proposed by CoInvalidation - white/green/red/blacklists. 
They could never push legislation through fast enough. They'd have to do it world-wide instantaneously and then they'd have to get everyone to start using new software immediately. This could never happen. Online wallets could be affected easier, but for the millions of people running desktop clients, nope.

How much has the fiat currency you paid for your BTC dived since you bought your 0.5? It's probably worth counting that in orders of magnitude, e.g. 10x, 100x, etc. 
Do you think you can hold on to it for another order of magnitude increase? Or is $500 today worth more than $5,000 in a year? 
If the latter, my guess is that you owe money to some pretty shady people with baseball bats. ;)

The vulnerable points already likely know it. There are quite a few people out there that could talk about some pretty obvious kinds of attacks, but those that would be directly affected by it should already be very aware of it.

I'd say keep them. Bitcoin is strongly rooted in cryptoanarchy, and by extension, ancap, etc. 
If someone likes all the wonderful possibilities of bitcoin, then there are certain to be aspects of ancap that they like. 
Bitcoin is simply antithetical to statism. 
While bitcoin is a neutral tool, it's neutral in the sense that you don't use a jackhammer to cook dinner. i.e. The right tool for the right job. Bitcoin is an excellent tool for ancaps, but is entirely antithetical to a strong statist position. 
But, do whatever you want. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:05:15


Yes. 


I had a near battle with my parents. I had to fight to get my mom to buy bitcoins. She wouldn't do it herself, so she gave it to me to do for her. (We have a very good relationship, so money isn't an issue or problem in the family like with some people.)
I also had to fight a bit to convince my sister to spend some fiat crap on bitcoins. She's got lots of money to invest, but only gave me a tiny bit to buy bitcoins for her.
The joke is on them. 
I just emailed them about an hour ago and told them what they'd made on their "investments". I'm expecting a couple emails similar to "HOLY FUCKING SHIT! WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ME TO INVEST MORE! YOU ASSHOLE!"

There is a world-wide currency war going on right now. The USD is under attack as the reserve currency. It will die. 
But it's still useful at the moment. So whether or not it's going to last until the end of time doesn't really matter. The question is whether or not you can use it now and the reasonably near or mid-term future. I think the answer for Bitcoins is a resounding yes.

Word gets around very quickly in expat communities, and I'd guess that there would be enough people knowledgeable enough to help others. From what I've seen, expat communities tend to band together to help each other. There are already systems in place to make wiring money much cheaper than through Western Union or banks. What happens is you have people with accounts set up in 2 countries, then they accept deposits going in both directions, and simply send out the money on the other end with no international transactions taking place. They're much cheaper than banks. I've used them in the past, and they've worked out well for me.

Yes. It is possible. However, it may be against the Google Play Store's terms of service. I won't comment on that. 
Enabling purchasing with bitcoins is very simple. You only need to setup an authorisation system similar to how most shareware or "try before you buy" software works. This has been done many, many times by many, many authors. 
There are no special considerations on Android. The only real consideration might be "how do you use your mobile device to capture a QR code if the QR code is already on your device?" 
But, like I said, this may be against the GPS terms of service. All my Android releases have been free, so I've never checked on that.

I wish! 
The current rate of increase is about 1 order of magnitude every 9~10 months or so. **IF** that continues, then we should expect to see bitcoins valued at 10x what they are now next August or September, which could put it at about $10,000 by November. But 10,000% would put it at about $80,000. 
However, will that rate continue? It could increase or decrease. What happens if a bunch of major retailers start accepting bitcoins and paying employees partially in bitcoins? Could we see an acceleration? Certainly. Anything is possible. 
I'd love to see that. I'd go out and blow a few bitcoins on a new house. 
So, let's hope that you're right (and not just being sarcastic). ;) 
Anyways, for my prediction... the most important thing to watch is people getting PAID in bitcoins. i.e. Employers purchasing bitcoins then paying employees in BTC (at least partially). 
Large employers could make significant gains here by temporally arbitraging their payrolls. Buy purchasing at the right time and paying $$$ amounts in BTC, they could keep the difference (or lose if they're not careful). This is a great business opportunity for an experienced trader/trading firm to hop on - offer payroll services in bitcoins for a fee + % of gains. 
Imagine a large employer offering to pay employees some percentage of their pay in BTC. The news alone would spark greater adoption by people, merchants, and businesses. 
Another industry to watch is the shipping industry. Will we see companies start opting for bitcoin escrow over LCs? It's a far better option for a lot of companies. Shipping btcFOB or btcCIF? x) Of course there's room for innovation there. While BitPay has solved the consumer/merchant problem, the same problem hasn't really been solved for international commerce the same way. The problem there is largely one of attitudes and people sticking with what they know, so any new solution would need to (at least initially) address the problem of long float times inside of escrow (which would replace an LC).

What can help is to figure out what you are going to buy, then make sure to buy enough bitcoins for that, then spend bitcoins. By cycling as much fiat into BTC as possible and then spending that, you do the BTC economy a great amount of good. 
e.g. If you can spend $200 a week in BTC, then buy at least $200 a week. But, it takes discipline to remember to wire to an exchange, etc. etc. It's not a lot of planning, but you do need to think ahead a bit. 
I look at my bitcoins as money that I'm going to spend. I have zero intention of "cashing out" ever.

But what about the printed money that was used to buy actual assets? e.g. land, legitimate businesses, etc. That's all just proceeds of actual crime. It's difficult or impossible for that (the value) to be returned to the people it was stolen from.

Imagine you bought a few months ago at 250, and the next day it tanked. But you held onto your bitcoins. You'd still be ahead 60% in a few months. 
Now... Name 1 fund manager that gets 60% in that time. 
Don't think about the price right now. Think about what it means to you. Perhaps that 0.5 BTC could help pay for university in a couple years? Perhaps it will help you out with getting a car down the road? 
Think of the time frame and then look at its performance. 
I'd say buy now before we hit the S curve and it takes off. And if you want, think of it as a big lottery ticket if that helps. 
But, you know your situation best. Read around and do what's best for you.

My response for that kind of thing is, "Don't look at the price. Look at the order of magnitude. You can buy now for 3 figures. That will be 4 shortly. In a year it will be 5. You're not buying what you think you're buying - you're buying decimal places."

Peter focuses on the physical aspect and how gold has physical value. 
Bitcoins have informational value, which he largely ignores or dismisses. His argument is that if it doesn't have physical value, it has no intrinsic value whatsoever. 
This is my take on it:

The order book prices are executed in order first by price then by the order they are received. 
In your example above, the highest order is for $730. Now, imagine John and Jane both want to buy for $730. John wants to buy 0.6 BTC, and Jane wants to buy 0.4 BTC. John enters his order before Jane. 
When you sell, John is buying 0.6 of your BTC then Jane is buying 0.4 of your BTC, for a total of 1 BTC at $730. 
Since you're selling 10, you've got 9 more to go. And so on down the list it goes. 
The above responses were correct, but I figured that this might help fill in a few gaps for you.

FYI - VoS has been nicely profitable -- just in case you're a trader. ;)

Abolutely! Right now that is what is needed - more people accepting bitcoin for purchases. Forget speculation - commercial usage and adoption will drive bitcoin more than anything else. 
E crypto, libertas? :D

I only wish that I had more liquid fiat to pour into bitcoins.

Don't forget to vote in the poll that's very small and half way down the page. They'll play it up later. At the moment it's 58/42 for using bitcoin. Get that number up for BTC!

Shitty. Sorry that didn't work for you. 
I logged in, and the site seems to be perfectly fine as far as response times go - it's pretty snappy. Considering the network path for me to connect (it's long &amp; far), the response time issues are likely from your end (your ISP). 
Anyways, good luck with it all. I hope you get that all sorted.

I donated to the Dark Wallet Project as well, but I did it in fiat, because well, as you know, fiat sucks balls and bitcoins are good. Why spend bitcoins when you can get rid of fiat? 
However, that the Dark Wallet project is about bitcoins played the  role in my decision. I wouldn't donate if they were some other wanker project.

Assume the environment is hostile, then take precautions against it. Run some AV software, a firewall, and a VPN. 
Being paranoid usually stops "them" from getting you. :)

Hahaha! I like the mirror thing. I didn't think of a "QR-selfie". Though I'm not sure about any QR code APIs on Android as I don't use those myself. I'm much more familiar with the Samsung Mobile SDK, and AFAIK, it doesn't include a QR code API. 
Yes - I realize that it's silly to have a QR code as since you're already in the code, you can do whatever you want. My point was (supposed to be) that the QR code is pretty much moot.

Seems to me that this is entirely relevant to bitcoin. 
Each time another bank tanks, and the central banksters start stealing from people, it scares people out of fiat. Where do they go? What are their options? 
Or other assets like land, etc. 
But still, this seems relevant to bitcoin - it seems to me like just one more reason to buy bitcoin and get out of fiat and the bankster system.

It means that they want you to use it on the exchanges in China and not with merchants in China or at banks.

It is also good to know that gold is manipulated. Blame Goldman Sachs for that. The precious metals market is one big scam. ETFs have ruined the market. Heck, even copper is manipulated.

I'll give you $10 for it. I need doorstop and that seems like a cool one. Heck, I'll give ya $15, but you pay for shipping. :) 
Or you could use it for a doorstop. But you'd be out $10 that you could have made!

Wrong. Well. Not wrong, but may be wrong sometime soon:

Whether it's legislation ABC or XYZ isn't particularly relevant to whether or not you become poorer. THAT you become poorer is the problem. So be it tax code or some other bit of "law", the path to pilfering your pocket is right there.

My bet of 1,000 BTC is that the sun will rise tomorrow and bitcoins will still be here. :)

So, you're saying that I should put sell orders progressively higher starting at $1,000,000 per bitcoin? :) That sounds like a party to me!

Learn from Apple... Let's see...
* Every tiny bit is proprietary and incompatible with anything else
* Must rape users for every penny possible
* Promise the world, and deliver shiny globes
* Sue everyone for any reason
* Steal designs from others, then accuse them of stealing from you
* Make markets proprietary and exclude people you don't like
* Rape market participants for as much as possible for the privilege of participating
* Attempt to shut down all other markets and claim that they infringe on your copyrights and patents
* Attempt to patent every word in the dictionary. Continue with more lawsuits
* List goes on...
Seriously? Apple? Apple is part of what is wrong in the world. Not even Microsoft is as douchey as Apple. BP and Exxon takes notes from Apple in learning to be douchier. The executives at JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs wank-off when they hear about Apple douchiness. 
I can't think of a worse example to imitate. Well, unless you're trying to secure a very special place in Hell for yourself.

Just keep reading up on it. There are things in it that are really, really not obvious to most people, and even most of the bitcoin community is oblivious to some of the best features of bitcoins. 


The most important thing is for people to be PAID for the work they do in BTC. Once that becomes more common, Bitcoin will become unstoppable. This is the single most important factor. e.g. If you're a merchant, and I get paid in bitcoins, and you want my business, what are you going to do? 
I WISH that my clients would pay me in bitcoins.

I wish I could liquidate my silver for bitcoins... :'(

AFAIK coined "CoInvalidation" to help point out the absurdity of what they are doing. "CoInvalidation" is fast becoming the accepted term for the insanity that "CoinValidation" is proposing. I'd stick with CoInvalidation.

I saw a similar hit piece somewhere else. Bloomberg or something. 
I say BS. From all the calculations I've done, as well as many others, the cost of electricity is not really all that significant. 
This is just some nonsense to get the environmentalist anthropogenic catastrophic climate change radicals screaming to kill bitcoin with bad information.
No, not bad information. Irresponsible and malicious information. 
The information is based on this:
* Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cent per kilowatt hour. **In reality some miners will be more or less efficient.**
The people that I know that do serious mining aren't consuming that much power, or anywhere near it.
Once again... BS. It's just another hit piece.

Right now they are sitting on 0.69% of all 21 million bitcoins. That they stole. Why would they buy more when they can just steal them from people?
