Don t know where you live but check on how much tax you 'll have to pay before selling your whole crypto asset for those numbers... being rich has a cost ;)

it's only 22:30 here... and weibo (the local twitter/facebook) has dedicated news page that any chinese with an interest in Bitcoin follow closely... I am sure the impact has mostly been done already.. Price has been dropping since 18:00 on the biggest exchange in CNY 
Honnestly not surprise that taobao is fighting this one of their biggest cash cow is alipay (an equivalent to paypal)... But on the mining hardware I'd like to see how they'll forbid Scrypt dedicated computer : 
They already fail badly at forbidding obviously fake goods...
Seems to me I can still buy them...

I had a somewhat different experience but that goes along with what you say about China and bitcoin making foreigner life much easier. I recently left shanghai after 3 years staying there. My new job is in Romania. Being used to have unionpay (an equivalent of visa/mastercard own by Chinese bank) accepted in every major European capital I looked on their website before leaving and saw a city bank branch would offer an atm service for my Chinese card once in Bucharest. 
I figured out that it would be much more convenient and cheaper (0.5 to 1% commission) to take cash from there once I would arrive than spending hours in my local bank converting RMB to RON little by little (as OP has said it already, Chinese bank loooove paper work).
What a disappointment for me to discover on my arrival that the local branch of City bank had closed it's ATM and basically all it's b2c services (apparently only one week before my arrival).
Reaction : local bitcoin sell. That same night I was meeting in a big hotel lobby a guy who gave me cash for bitcoin. Was able to live, pay my rent and deposit until my first paycheck. Thank god (or satoshi) for bitcoin.  Even though I was not so happy to have to sell some of my bitcoins... It was still such a release to not have to go to a western union bank transfer or to have to sell my watch :) bitcoin are already global and a very efficient reserve of value wherever you can go. As for the RMB that remain on my Chinese account I guess I will have to wait a bit for a trip to London or Paris to convert them into Euros. I am sure you can Guess what I ll buy with them...

Some taobao merchant accept payment on delivery... and very few of them decided it was a way  for them to get noticed by displaying banners that they accepted bitcoin...
(most transaction on taobao are done after a negociation through a chat window on the taobao shop pages... so adding an extra manual payment option was no problem for them)
As said before Alibaba group is beyond taobao, the owner of the local paypal (alipay)... So that is no surprise that they don't support bitcoin as a payment method for the merchant of their plateform... Merchant whom again are very few to accept bitcoin. 
Anyway if you are chinese, for 75% of your online shopping you'll talk with the customer service through a chat. Nothing can stop the merchant from offering this option while chatting with their client. of course this directive will probably slow down the spread of bitcoin as a payment on taobao, but anyway alipay is pretty reliable and I don't think so many chinese trust taobao merchant enough to pay in advance without the intermediation of an escrow plateform like paypal or alipay.

I want to see them trying to ban anything on this marketplace... it is still florishing with fake goods despite the commitment they made in the past.  
those are obviously made for mining... yet they will still be live tomorrow I guarantee. and if "Scrypt" or "asic" becomes censored terms on their plateform don't worry chinese are used to censorship and their creativity to replace characters with some that look similar is unlimited :

The marketing argument to buy a phone or a tablet that generate money without having to think about it would work for many people. 
I only discovered bitcoin recently (maybe 1 year and half) and even though I looked into  mining I thought it was too capital intensive and probably too complex to do for me (I know I am probably 99% dumber than the rest of r/bitcoin) 
But they also make the argument that Mining is at core a decentralised/distributed process. So having millions of tiny devices doing this distributed calculation could still earn a fair share of the blocksfor 21's pool. 
Their share of the mining blocks could be huge in the long run as their chips spreads and since bitcoin can be divided into lots of tiny satoshi each little machine contributing  could still be rewarded (minus 21's pool commission). 
As the adoption grows so does the value of bitcoin and the value people view in having a phone "21powered" rather than one where they need to setup an app to put bitcoin they had to purchase on a marketplace / trading plateform. 
There is probably lots of technical roadblock that some of you seem to foresee much better than I do, but from a mass market adoption point of view... Geez this is exciting.

I don't understand people trying to convince themself and this sub that not having the ETF approved is a good thing... 
It's not the end of the world for sure... but  the value of XBT would have gone through new high if  the ETF would have been approved and we would be drinking champagne and posting "too the moon meme" right now...
So please stop presenting it as a win...
Like you say : 


It's a lost battle... but the war is not over

This is sick... I wish there would be something similar in Romania. The fees asked by my bank to convert euros to Lei are always too high for my taste. And the number of ATM is really impressive. Thanks for sharing this OP.

Ho but wait till trumps try to evict the fed chairman...  that's when the global economy will lose the confidence it had for more than 60 years... he s such a useful tool !

Oh I see... if you prefer to hear the news  from a complotist media or the Kremlin own  be my guest...
 
Here is also a little bit of foxnews for an even more complete picture of this news.
Comparing BBC and huffpost to infowars and RT does not make it less true. Soon trump will launch a procedure to replace the head of the fed he appointed himself.  and that will be a terrible news for investors confidence in the dollars... not necessarily for bitcoin (or euros and RMB..)

Just go check your great leader tweets. You re so endocrined by him about news report being fake that whatever source I ll provide you, you still won't believe he is unhappy with the current direction of fed reserve. And when trump is unhappy with a manager what does he do : he tries to fire him or get him fired.
