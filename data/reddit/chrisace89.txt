The community has to review and test the code before the miners just accept new software. The current lead developers could introduce a bug now on purpose or on accident. That is why the more people who review and work on the code the more likely mistakes will be caught.

It's a volatile currency at this time but it is also a asset. It's volatile like stocks but once it gets big enough the volatility will slow down. But there are only ever going to be 21 million coins which means the value of these coins have to be well over 100,000 to be any significant player in currency. If bitcoin becomes stable at this point of about a 8 billion market cap then I would consider it a irelivent as a currency.  So if bitcoin is going to be a big player it has to grow and it can't grow without volatility.

Eactly, coinbase and circle are the beginning of bitcoin banks. Just like when people say bitcoin replaces credit cards, makes no scenes. Bitcoin is a currency like the dollar, credit cards are a service on top of the dollar and there will be credit card services on top of bitcoin. Basically all services that currently exist for the dollar will exist for bitcoin eventually.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:25:58
Pretty much. Lol
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:43:39
I notice a lot of people comparing bitcoin the currency to credit cards which is a  service on top of currency. 
No one gets promotional offers from the US dollar. I can guarantee you there will be credit cards built on top of bitcoin as a service. Companies like coinbase and bitpay will be sending you junk mail promotions in the future.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:24:09
I don't see how comparing internet "adoption" to bitcoin "downloads" means anything. A graph of bitcoin adoption would give a better picture. 
Also when I compare bitcoin to the internet I am trying to state that bitcoin is as important and a breakthrough as big as the internet . Adoption might take longer because restructuring our financial industry is a lot different then just allowing free flow of information. The regulation for bitcoin is going to be a long battle unlike what the internet had to face. 
But who knows bitcoin might be napster and just die. Maybe etherium is the next big thing but I definitely feel something big is going to come out of crypto currencies.

Doesn't seem like it. The bitcoin panel kept saying bitcoin is not a ideal way to buy and sell drugs because it is not anonymous. They kept saying there is a public ledger not ideal for illicit activity. Regulators never argued that point.

"WHAT IS TRULY REMARKABLE IS THE STORY OF ZERO TO 6 MILLION."When people write the history of this thing, of bitcoin, they are not going to write the story of 6 million to a billion. What is truly remarkable is the story of zero to 6 million. It has already happened! And we’re not paying attention! That’s incredible. That’s what had one chance in a million and it already happened.
Bitcoin, the community, we are going to add more than 1 million this month, we will be at 10 million by the end of the year, and if it keeps growing the way it has, it will be at more than a billion within five years. Each one of those people are infecting new people so that a few more join each month, and it’s then that payments start to happen organically."
I love this part!
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:33:46
No you are right, 8 decimal places is not enough. If the smallest unit is 4 cents that is to high. Not only that if bitcoin does become the world currency it would most likely be over 10 years from now. At that time the money supply would be higher which would make the smallest unit worth more. 
Even saying all of that this is a super easy problem to fix and that would be just to change the code to allow more decimal places.

This podcast was so stupid and over simplify complicated issues. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 09:35:55
You keep jumping around so lets stick to your main point. 


You have no idea what OPEC winter production is this year, What are you talking about? Also if they produced more in the past. And I mean our very recent past like last year. Why did the prices not drop last year like they have this year?
Edit I almost forgot and I cant leave this out.


That entire article was stating that OPEC will NOT DECREASE production. I never said OPEC decreased production I said this is the same production they always have.   Some member of OPEC wanted to arifically limit supply to increase price, that is dumb because that just means more market share goes to shell in USA. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 09:06:21


Isnt this simple supply and demand. America now produces more oil than ever because of shell. This creates more supply with the same demand. More supply same demand = less prices. OPEC is producing what they always produce. 


Once again your saying OPEC increased production and they did not. USA Increased production. But you never say the price went down because of USA you only say price went down because of OPEC.

Please ad Storj and the getgems coin to your platform. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:48:46
This seems to prove my point. As you can see in the chart they have produced more oil in many years in the past, then they do now and oil prices were still higher. Seems to be the difference now is that America produce more oil than any country. Which was not true in the past. America producing is a steady increase while OPEC fluctuates between 29million and 33. Which is why I said this is standard oil production for OPEC. So I don't understand why everyone says OPEC should cut production when USA cause the increase in supply. I don't think anyone should cut production because I love these Gas prices.  lol

Good question, I know you can't lose any bitcoin during a fork but I'm not sure if the software developers have to send out a updated or not for that wallet  to see the new blockchain. 
But let's say you are using a wallet and there is a fork and your wallet no longer has support from the develops and it's not seeing the new blockchain.  All you would have to do is move your private keys to a different Wallet that sees the new blockchain.  That is why during a fork people will not accept any bitcoins because they don't know which blockchain is real.

Basically when there is a fork you have two blockchains and can basically spend the same bitcoin twice, once on each  blockchain. In the past this fork only lasted for 3 to 4 hours. Basically if we were to have a fork the bitcoin ecosystem would stop for a while, while we wait for one of the forks to win.  During the fork business would not accept any bitcoin because we don't know which fork would win. Once we find out which fork wins everything goes on.  
Ways to have a fork without stopping the ecosystem is to say that the changes won't take affect for another 500 blocks so that gives everyone a chance to change to the new software days in advance, or not change to the new software. Whoever has the majority hashing power when we get to that block wins and the network never stops.
Im not a programmer but have been involved with bitcoin since 2012 so I'm pretty sure this is how it works but maybe someone more technical can explain it better.

@_date: 2015-01-15 03:48:53
Creating your own token depends on what type of product you are building.  For example Storj.io is a decentralized storage program. What makes to token valuable is that you need the storage token to buy storage on the platform.  Getgems is a social messaging app and what makes their token valuable is that you need the token  to advertise on the platform to all the users. 
So if your going to try to create a token to make funds your product needs to have a use case for the token. Otherwise if you need money you need to do more of a kickstarter type of crowd fund.

Interesting,  so hard forks have to do with hardware changes and soft forks is just a software change?

Show me any evidence that OPEC increase production. They are producing the same amount they produced last year. Also 5 months ago was around the time the price of oil started to drop.

I thought it was bad for miners to create big blocks because it increases chance of orphan.

Google now is awesome I literally look for new things to tell google just to see how google now will interpret it and feed new data to me. 
For example im on vacation in San Francisco right now. I was late to catch the flight because of a friend so I was freaking out that I was not going to make the flight. Google told me I needed to leave 45 minutes earlier than I did. 30 minutes before I missed my flight, because you must be at airport at least a hour ahead to check in bags, google now updated me saying my flight was delayed a hour. Totally relaxed all fears because I knew I could now make it. Keep in mind the entire time google is monitoring my location and flight details with out me having to do anything. Some people think that this is a breach of privacy. I think google is building something special with all the data it has and will own the future. 
I can give so many more cool example of google now and how google monitors all my data to give me valuable information but this is a really divisive issue, you either love it or you hate it. I absolutely love it and can't wait to get my moto 36o to have google now on my watch.

It's not the cause of ransomeware, bitcin just made it  easier and more convenient.  Similar to how the Internet made it easier an convenient  to hack into data bases sitting at home in your undies.

your balance and credit is held in dollars and then instantly converted to Bitcoin when you make a purchase. They might be using bitreserve on the backend.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:08:16
Looks great
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:17:44
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:16:08
This is a guess but what they probably do is have a business account with a company like bitreserve. Give all clients credit in dollars and then convert the exact amount they need in Bitcoin when the client makes a purchase. That is why there is no valitiliy but you get all the benefits of Bitcoin.

This is no dangerous than when people  meet up for Craigslist items. People should do this in public places. 
But I see huge potential is just local business become teller, or a gas station. It's so easy to set up I don't see why all business won't have this . 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:42:38
What if you are just a corner local business. I seems like a nice little way to make more income.

We are in uncharted waters here.  Not only is the dollar getting stronger everyday. What is going to happen when companies like tether put the US dollar on the blockchain?  Not only is the US dollar the reserve currency but it will be the first fiat currency that can move around the world like bitcoin.

Why do these t-shirts cost 25 dollars. I remember when I use to make shirts I could get them made for like 4 bucks a piece.

Really nice. I'm going to check this Wallet out. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:14:14
This is for average people not bitcoin fans and with this app you never have to touch the physical 200 dollars because you can get the digital dollars with your debit card. (which are really just bitcoins) 
Also with this app you don't have to worry about volatility.

It's Facebook, this corporation is large. You think he is trying to sell credit cards numbers on the black market or something? 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:38:00
Even if he did do that I don't see how giving Facebook a credit card number is anymore dangerous than shopping anywhere else with a credit card. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:40:41
How would you send 200 US dollars to someone in mexico and then they get the equivalent in pesos on local bitcoins?

That's fine I totally agree. I'm just saying there will be no large adoption until this is easy and bitcoin is nothing without large adoption.

I wish people would stop bashing Coinbase. Coinbase is one of the best companies in this industry and it would be a lot more difficult to get coins with out them. Also they are just following the law they don't want to have unhappy customers. Buy I would not doubt if this post was fake anyway.

99% of people in here think it is a great investment and currently at a great price. You have to look at the tech and ask your self if this technology is usful and has applications for a many people. If yes than the price has to go up if not than you would not be asking this question. 
Alt coins just makes things 100X more complicated. I personally would stick with bitcoin and play a little bit with counterparty assets like gemz or storj. What I like about some of the counterparty project tokens is that you need the token to use a feature in the software which gives the token a reason to exist. Unlike alt coins that are basically bitcoin clones.

Awesome!! Industry bitcoin remittance leader. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:36:30
Well i think the first and most obvious reason for this decentralized ledger is bitcoin a currency, also I think decentralized storage like Storj.io has amazing applications,  also Getgems. 
I think the new type of crowd funding by using a token and giving the early investor a way to be apart of the company is really powerful. It allows anyone to get in on ground floor of a idea. It's like giving people stock of a company instead of kickstarter  method of buying the product. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 05:26:00
Thanks, I think you are right.

I don't understand this idea. if I'm walking down the isle of a store and I see something I want. Why would I scan and have the item shipped when I can just take it off the shelf and have it right away?

I think your missing the fact that America does not owe china bitcoins they owe China dollars. So if dollars become worthless because of bitcoin then the trillions of dollars USA owes won't really be that much money. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:17:47
I don't think it's possible to calculate maximum because we don't know how many coins are lost and we don't know how fast adoption will take place. Full adoption in two years from now or full adoption in 2050 will have different values. If 10% of coins are lost vs 35% of the coins that would have a affect as well.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:20:27
I disagree with you completely. First when we live in a digital world why does our money need to be tangable? Bitcoins have so much potential and I think the price we see today is cheap compared to what is coming. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:22:40
I think there will be tools coming out making it very easy for people to be there own bank. With wallet mixing and other tools I don't think the government will ever know how many bitcoins people really have.

They should show wallet accounts with balances in them and explain bitcoin is similar to online banking except a lot easier to send to anyone anywhere with anyone's approval.
