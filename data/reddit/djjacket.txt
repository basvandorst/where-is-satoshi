Some of these coins only have a mintage of 45-1000.  Your "list of wealthly" and early adopters globally far exceeds that number.

Most likely BitPay since they are both in Atlanta, GA
Although it does seem that they may integrate with many Bitcoin Processors - "After registering with a bitcoin processor, all merchants have to do is activate bitcoin as a payment option in the POS back office within NCR Silver."

I agree with the bitcoin.tax website service.  I have been using it for years and found it very helpful.  Allows you to import trade information from all the major exchanges and also manually input anything.
Use my referral link :)

I see you linked the bitcoin.tax site above.  That platform does a great job of importing trade history for many platforms to allow for the calculations of the Short Term Gain/Loss calculations you reference above.
It also allows you to choose a Like-Kind trade evaluation for BTC-&gt;ALT trades to see how that would affect the tax calculations.  I chose to be conservative and do taxable events for each trade and by using the platform, it would be easy for me to go back and change my selection and determine if it is worth it to re-file returns should the IRS put out guidance that Like-Kind classifications are acceptable.
I purchased their service to allow me to import all my transactions from trading activity, purchases, and mining. I found it VERY helpful and I would not have been able to perform all the calculations and scenarios in a spreadsheet without a ton more work.  I highly recommend it.   The link above is a referral link for my account.

Yes, that is a capital gain.  Your basis for the coins is the rate when you mined them and when you sell them you calculate the difference to determine capital gain/loss.
