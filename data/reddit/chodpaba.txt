I think the same can be said for large individual suppliers of hashing power that don't necessarily need a pool. To me there is little reason to even participate in a pool if you can get paid at least once or twice a month, and I prefer that more miners do this for the sake of diversification. 


It is to me as well. And this is where I think that smart contract networks like LN can help to introduce some geographic diversity. As a portion of fees move into these networks it is a natural hedge for miners to diversify into supporting this aspect of the network as well as liquidity providers, which I think will also require the operation of full verifying nodes. It does not completely solve the problem but I think it offers some encouragement in the right direction.

Who knows what will happen beyond 5nm? But my point is that the effect of technological deflation as a result of Moore's law has been called prematurely dead, by some. 


Centralized mining is driven by the fact that the newest, latest custom technology ends up in the hands of a few big miners, giving them the opportunity to suck the profit out of it before anyone else can get their hands on it. This means, effectively, that we can look forward to at least another five years of the dominance of centralized mining.
The only hope of strategies for decentralization like 'utility heating' miners working is a leveling off of the performance/cost advantage for new ASICs. Because it does not work economically if you have to replace an expensive 'heating element' every two years.

Even Sealand has similar problems with security, the natural elements, etc. Liberland appears to lay in a rather flood-prone and ecologically sensitive area. Access by roads, bridges, and air will all require the cooperation of its neighbors. And then there is the issue of emergency services, which initially would also have to be supplied by Liberland's neighbors. I don't hear any Liberland proponents speaking honestly, or with any nuts-and-bolts detail about how any of these issues may be addressed... It's all just 'beacon of freedom' crap, and it smells kind of fishy.

I beg to differ. Just having a worker means that you supply hashing power, not that you control it outside of where it is pointed and whether it is running. The pools set policy. Yea, still ten individuals control 90% of that.

Scalability is only an issue for platforms that are actually adopted. Which can happen quickly. As we have seen in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum which are struggling to scale on their own. Any new generation of development will realize the most value if it focuses on scalability. Those platforms which can not scale will be recognized for their limited value. 
But the ultimate scaling feature is interoperability. Those platforms that have little facility for interoperability with their peers will suffer as they become hemmed in compared with their interoperable counterparts. There are several 'dark' platforms, for instance, that lack an ability to be used with smart contracts which places powerful features like atomic swaps out of their reach. But among those 'dark' platforms that are so extensible, they will ultimately attract more value than their more insular counterparts. 
So, more important than the ability of any single platform to scale on its own, I think, is an ability to work with other crypto platforms. We are now long past the days where it is useful to introduce a new project without this ability.

Yes, it is brilliant news. Security experts have long warned of the problem posed by mining being so concentrated in a single jurisdiction. It compromises the security assumptions of the platform, which requires a diverse network. As well, trading shouldn't be centralized either. This is forcing diversity on miners and traders alike.

I would like to believe Mayer's forecast but I feel that it is much too aggressive. A new ATH by the end of the year seems reasonable to me but I think it could go much lower in the interim.
The healthiest long term path the market could take, in my opinion, would be a decline to the $4,000's by mid-August with new ATH's coming in 2019. I think this would bring much needed confidence in the longer term price levels we will be seeing. Which will still melt faces.

It doesn't work that way. Mining is not just about producing coins, it is the means by which transactions are added to the blockchain. Furthermomre, the reason that mining is so resource intensive is to make it an expensive proposition to attack the blockchain, it provides security.

Oh, I totally get that cryptocurrency platforms are not Buffet's cup of tea. But I do not believe that he really understands how to value them.

Warran Buffet is not a VC guy. Even so, I believe that crypto investors can learn quite a lot from him about investing in general. 
But to quote Buffet: "We don't own any, we're not short any, we'll never have a position in them," he said. "I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about," he added. "Why in the world should I take a long or short position in **something I don't know anything about.**"

But this is not usually how wallets work without using coin control. Left to their defaults they will usually spend from the larger UTXO's regardless of age because this is usually cheaper. Using smaller UTXO's may mean adding inputs to a transaction and thus raises the transaction fee so these tend to get older. 
But it seems to me that if you are identifying individual UTXO's there would be a tax-planning benefit that could override any possible increased transaction cost from choosing UTXO's based on age instead of size. Sure, it adds a level of complexity, but this is not anything that couldn't be handled by a spreadsheet. And since you can determine the exact basis for each and every UTXO then FIFO and LIFO become irrelevant.

Always? So far I have not heard a compelling argument for why you could not simply report the exact basis for each UTXO, It is not just a matter of the internal working of the wallet, it is provable on the blockchain.

I am not talking about XMR or Dash. I am talking about Bitcoin, here, in r/Bitcoin.  But even if someone sends you payments through a mixer, or you send a payment to someone else through a mixer this does not effect the provable cost basis for the UTXO's in your wallet. They come in at a certain time, at a certain value, and they are spent at a certain time, at a certain value. 
Regarding the example of change created from older coins, this does require some examination. In that specific instance you could be placed at a disadvantage. But most active wallets are not like that, and you would likely be able to choose UTXO's that do not place you in this situation. Under certain market conditions you may even be able to avoid a taxable event. For some, this could very well offset any privacy concerns. For instance, if instead of legal tax avoidance someone is otherwise leveraging the privacy of transactions for illegal tax evasion, this incentive for privacy may be neutralized.

Compared to the current daily USD equivalent volume for Bitcoin of $12,511,500,000 that is actually 5.8%... That will change by the hour so to be fair you might be able to find an instance where it is actually 10%. But that is not now.

Where LN really helps with centralization is it reduces the need for real-time settlement. Since this is thought to reduce the number of transactions which hit the blockchain it should make it easier to operate full listening nodes. Which, if those become more centralized it is bad news for the security assumptions. 
If you are really that concerned about it then run a LN node yourself. And maybe even run a full listening node to boot. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:26:13
That depends. If you always use new addesses though it is still possible, but unlikely that the extent of your blokchain activity will be discoverable. With diligent coin control these efforts can be fairly well frustrated.

Because centralized payment hubs still have to have pathways to everyone who uses them... ABC payment processor for store XYZ will have to have paths to each of XYZ's Bitcoin paying customers. And each of those customers are free to have as many channels open with each other as they want. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 04:53:31
How small would the pool of listening nodes have to shrink before miners would consider paying to expand the network?
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:12:32
I think this probably has more to do with overhead on the network. If all paths are possible with fewer channels this is what you want, versus a lot of redundant channels in excess of that amount. Which is what you would have if everyone tried to open channels, with everyone else. 
But let's say someone opens a lot of channels for the heck of it just as LN is taking off, but they have a node with a slow connection or hardware. It could *temporarily* bog down the network until more connections are opened to route around it. And the topology of the network could end up being sub-optimal because of this. I think this scenario of starting up the network is what the devs are talking about. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:36:57
Those volunteers are Disappearing though... And they must also download the data, even though they are not validating it. 
Am I incorrect that the original conception was for validation to be more decentralized than it now is? Within that original framework it makes sense to 'pay' for the network through block bounties and fees. But the function of validation and running the distributed network has largely become separated, with no means of compensation for actually running the network.
This needs to be fixed.

I really don't understand why a business would not want to open channels to its customers. What is the disincentive? It is just a Bitcoin transaction. In order for there to be any enforceable regulation it would have to be exposed somehow to banking networks, no?

If they are prevalent, and they serve as hubs for large numbers of LN channels then this makes LN work better.
The issue of centralization you are talking about really has nothing to do with LN. But rather the use of large payment processors full stop. But if they are prevalent, as you say, this is less of a problem than if there were only one or two. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 23:43:03
Those efficiencies will buy us some time, and we should implement them. 
So, I agree. First things first. But we will eventually have to face up to the costs.  
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:50:13
It is 'currently' impossible. 
But even as efficiencies are realized for operating full nodes there is still the spectre of Jevon's Paradox to contend with. Whatever capacities are realized will get used up. And while we can *hope* that technological deflation keeps pace with demands on the network, this is no guarantee. 
There has to be a way of costing out the network that is actually tied to the demands placed upon it. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:11:15
Those are hardware wallets, not full nodes. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:40:43
Well yeah, that's in the whitepaper. That is why they are working so very hard to get LN up and running. If we are left to large blocks for scaling then running full listening nodes can become prohibative, and would become more centralized. With LN the number of transactions which hit the blockchain are reduced by deferring settlement. This won't entirely eliminate the need for growing blocksize but if it reduces the rate of on blockchain transactions things are a lot easier on the full listening nodes and it remains more likely that many of us will continue to operate these nodes. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:35:15
Let's take the extreme example. 
ABC payment processor has channels open to *every single LN node*. But one day they get mad at me and close the channel they have with me. All I have to do is to open a channel with *any other LN node* connected with them and **BOOM** I have a path open to them again.
Now, if they really wanted me to not gain a path to them then ABC payment processor would have to keep *very few* channels open. But this also means that it is *harder for others to do business through them*. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:10:56
Then you base the compensation on download data. This is what causes costs to be incurred. And that bandwidth is more important for some operators than others, they can pay. Pool operators, for instance, need lots of connections to the relay network.
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:32:49
The same way you do with transactions, with a fee, on a market basis.
If you are offering to pay for connection you set your nodes message fee to an offer value. If you are offering to sell a connection you set your nodes message fee to an ask value. If you accept the deal the connection is made and payment is held for delivery of the agreed amount of data. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:40:06
But what has happened is that while "generate coins" has become more centralized, the relay network still has to be distributed in order for the original security presumptions to remain valid. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:30:00
Because of that distinguishing factor, providing proof that specific transactions occurred. That proof is built into Bitcoin. Such proof is not built into gold and has to be provided as an adjunct.
Gold has a proof problem. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:54:00
The security model for the network requires nodes to be in many hands. Should large miners also dominate the network there are two ways this can threaten the network. In one instance it becomes more possible to create choke points should an operator who controls a large number of nodes be compromised, say by a government, or other hostile entity like a bank.  And in another instance, if miners become uncooperative it becomes ground for some to propagate their own blocks rapidly while denying bandwidth to other miners.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:23:55
Of course it is currently not possible. This will have to change. Efficiencies can be sought, as you mention, but [Jevons paradox]( always kicks in. Whetever capacity there is will get used up. 
Sure, it is not very interesting to a pool operator to pay for relay bandwidth as they are presently getting it for 'free', but it is interesting to all the node operators who supply it. At some point, if there are to be enough relays, some encouragement by way of compensation may well be necessary. And those who need that on-network bandwidth will gladly pay for it if it is required for the continuation of their business models.
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:21:05
Large payment hubs *decrease* centralization and *increase* network connectivity. 
If a payment hub has access to say 10 channels that means it is exposed to all of the paths those 10 LN nodes are connected to... And vice versa. 
If a payment hub has access to 1000 channels that means it is exposed to all the paths those 1000 LN nodes are connected to... And vice versa. 
Larger hubs mean *more* connectivity--not less.

If they are already using a Bitcoin payment processor then LN is completely transparent to a business. LN is just handled by the payment processor. 
If a payment processor has very many channels at all they could not very well pick-and-choose who they are exposed to through LN. The larger the processor the more exposure, they would not be able to exclude anyone without somehow managing all the connections of all of their customers. What are they going to do, boot you off if you open a channel without their permission?
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:37:03
The question becomes less critical if there is a means to compensate full nodes. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:04:16
It would not necessarily require micropayments. Contracts for connections can be bundled and settled in convenient sized lumps.
For instance, if someone offers a bid for on-network bandwidth, or an ask for selling bandwidth it can be for any sized data bundle. Once the agreed upon bundle is delivered the contract would settle. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:51:50
The most decentralized topology possible is one where *every single LN node has a channel open with every other LN node*. It would not even take any where near that level of connectivity to make all paths possible. Break one channel and all paths are still possible. 
The most centralized topology possible is where all the nodes are connected in an open daisy chain. Break one channel and part of the network is cut off. But even so, this is easily healed. 
Given this, I hope you can see that larger hubs of channels lead to less centralization (single points of control for access).

Proof for gold accounts. Nuff said.

Providing proof in both cases can be costly. Continual audits for gold accounts, which includes the entire chain of custody if it is ever moved. And you had better have access to an x-ray spectrometer if you stack phys, that is, if you really want to be sure. Then everyone who trades with you has to accept your proxies for proof, or provide their own.
It is ungainly.

Gold does not have the potential to upset the status quo, but bitcoin, or its underlying technology, does have that potential. And that is what this is about. To this end it is absolutely the case that Bitcoin does not operate in a vacuum, quite intentionally. 
Imagine the value that gold would have to someone who had little exposure to it or any of the meanings that have built up around gold. Someone from a culture that did understand gold as we do could easily exploit the lack of understanding of the gold virgin who perceives gold as valueless because it is useless directly as food, for instance. 
This is where we have been, and still are in some respects, with Bitcoin. And all the problems that have been encountered, and will be encountered with Bitcoin are part of that process of changing a paradigm.

Very simply, they don't rely on gold. In all reality they rely upon a web of trust. Gold relies on trust. And if gold  did not rely on trust, such as if it were actually used to fuel international commerce, the routine use of gold for transactions would look every bit as 'dramatic'. 
Bitcoin does not rely on trust in the same way, because it has licked the 'proof' problem. 
I reiterate. Gold has a proof problem.

@_date: 2017-02-03 02:57:44
The industrial scale miners clearly do dominate mining. And it is only by virtue of their self-restraint that they do not carry out such attacks. If they choose to collude there is really no way to keep them from doing so. If the CPC chooses to intervene with majority hashing share miners within their jurisdiction they can certainly do that. 
If you change the POW they can amass more hashing power faster then anyone else. They have relationships with custom hardware shops in Wuhan and Shenzhen. They can dominate any POW. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:30:37
Those interested in making a power play would gladly confuse the users.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:00:15


As long as there is an incentive to mine there will be someone leveraging that incentive. That incentive forms the very basis of Bitcoin's security model. If you actually succeed in eroding the profit incentive for miners you also erode security, which requires exponential growth to stay ahead of technological deflation. 


I am saying that all incentive systems lead to geometric distribution curves. 


Okay, you close up shop. If you wish to hand over power to those who hold a majority of the power, go right ahead. I am saying that your motivations are perverse. By making mining *more* difficult you accelerate the centralization of power. Just as handing over control of the blocksize to miners effectively crowns them as central economic planners for Bitcoin. It is foolishness to hand them more power willingly, and perversely, that is exactly what you propose when you are advocating for changes to the POW. 
At this point about the only thing Bitcoin stakeholders can really do is to carpet places like the Columbia Valley in mines. But the bar for doing that is getting higher and higher. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:54:36
Not quite. You refer only to attacks which are rational to the interests of miners. There are many more possible attacks possible if those miners are coerced by another party. Up to, and including the cessation of mining. This forms the basis of a Nash Equilibrium whereby arbitrary demands may be placed.
Given the level of difficulty supported by such hashing power, if it is removed it could be a very long time before another block is generated, effectively shutting down Bitcoin. They can then throttle right back up to attack again, and again if their hashing power can not be balanced. But the point of doing so would be moot since the value of Bitcoin would be destroyed by then. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:27:13


I have been around Bitcoin since about 2010 and this idea has been talked to death. The simple fact of the matter is that idle stock will never be able to compete with new stock which can be purchased at a lower unit cost. It's a bit like Ron Paul telling Libertarians he can be President, they like the way that sounds but all it really does is to safely isolate them to a political backwater. That is exactly what would happen with SpareHardDriveCoin.


I told you what I am proposing. Carpet the Columbia Valley and places like it with mines. 


It is not dead. It just can not really be evenly distributed. But it should at least be distributed across several political jurisdictions instead of being concentrated in just one. 
So you can dispense with your strawman. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:38:23
If they can mine what you want they can dominate what you want. 
How do you fire them, if you sell Bitcoin to buy Ether, for instance, and they mine both? It all requires different hardware, but that is not a barrier to an industrial scale miner. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:14:35
Although I am not entirely convinced that we could not see successful attacks which could lead to centralization. It all seems very nascent at this point.
But we are left with a bit of a catch-22 when it comes to changing the POW for Bitcoin in that the miners themselves would have to implement it. It seems that the only way forward would be a completely alternate coin. 
This has been my criticism of the btcfork initiative though, that they wish to capture the value of Bitcoin seemingly as a branding effort rather than addressing the inflation of newly minted coins. But I think it could be done with a sidechain that does its own verification but also allows coin creation to occur with a proof-of-burn on the original chain. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:20:52


That's kind of what I thought. What about GPUs, how many total shaders?


Yeah, everyone knows where to get the consumer miners. There are better deals to be had but you have to get them in MW sized chunks. And as you should know it takes about a month to get a shipment from China. 


You have to order early and often, they go fast because the bigger miners buy them all up. But there is more than one. There is indeed little hope for the home gamer. Like I say, the bar is high and getting higher. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:21:55


So, that only requires that industrial miners obtain massive amounts of storage. Which can be manufactured at higher levels today than at any other point in history, for a lower unit cost. 


Coming from a consumer perspective, of course. You are not their customer. As far as competing for hashpower it is *very* efficient. But for industrial customers only... That is where the game is being played... Not in the garage, not anymore.  
Edit: But if it makes you happy I will read the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:11:57


Again, it costs everybody money. It costs the Industrial miners less than it costs everyone else. 


If it has to be GPUs the industrial miners can have dozens of GPU ICs and associated components mounted on a custom board. 
But really, anything a GPU can do an ASIC can do better, while they are massively scaling GPUs they can also hire to have FPGAs or ASICs to do it better... This road is pretty well trod. I don't care how many different hashing algos you you switch between, it is possible to architect generalized hardware to meet all the necessary parameters for processing cores and memory to quickly go from one to another if need be. 
Even if it were possible for you to purchase the same exact custom hardware that is available to the industrial miners in any quantity, they will still have it a month sooner than you and for less cost. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:21:19


There is only a limited supply of such GPU's, not enough to complete with even an specialized FPGA harwardware implementation, which could be deployed pretty rapidly.


I don't think you understand. They would build them in order to guard against obsolescence. Right now it is not necessary most are pretty happy with the current hashing algos. But if it were to become necessary then a more generalized hardware platform will be developed. 


As long as it is possible for a small group to dominate hashing that is exactly what can happen. So far everything you have proposed would make them more powerful still. China can provide the cheapest power for transmission tier customers, Chinese companies have all the capabilities and scale to manufacture any electronic design. Any existing stock of leftover GPUs you happen to have lying about can quickly be swamped out by the next generation of chips. It is much more likely that *you* will be the one left with a useless heater that you are paying way too much to power. 


There is no amount of brute force that you can bring to bear to change the dynamic of unequal distribution of capital or hashpower, that won't make it even worse. It is going to take a solution that the world has not yet learned how to solve. 
The distribution of resources always tends to follow a geometric distribution curve. And if you are using a hard puzzle to limit distribution, as Bitcoin does, then this distribution curve will only tend to get steeper as that puzzle gets harder (with increasing difficulty), which is exactly what is happening. You may think that you can change that by changing the nature of the problem but as long as it relies upon: 1.) Cheap electric power and 2.) Computing hardware, just know that there is presently a single state jurisdiction where it is easiest to procure both of those items, in spades.  
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:44:42
So, in practice, a hostile fork.
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:34:50


It costs everybody money. It costs the industrial scale miners less. That is the advantage of economies of scale. 
Even so, just as they would have to adjust to a change of platform so does everyone else. And the same dynamics which resulted in them dominating the hashrate in the first place would work to place them right back in the same position. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:21:17
Well, we both know that users disagree about these things.

@_date: 2017-02-03 19:57:18


Sotage, memory, whatever you want to call it can be obtained by the truckoad (straight from the factories, on actual trucks) by Chinese miners. And for the same reason that new supercomputers overshadow clusters cobbled together from discarded PS3s so will any new technology vs. existing stock. 


The capacity needed for competing with industrial miners (for direct monetary incentive) far exceeds the capacity for other less monetized applications. No matter how 'general purpose' the hardware. Sure, have fun calculating a more accurate value for Pi. 
 &gt;I agree we don't hand things to the miners, and we either fight them on it, or we toss POW into the dustbin of failed ideas.
It hasn't failed, it works great for majority miners, just as POS works great for majority stake holders... This is the problem that has yet to be solved.

It doesn't really matter if miners have ties to the CPC, they are at their fingertips, being tied to fixed physical infrastructure as they are. The CPC or the PBOC can intervene unilaterally any time they decide to do so. Including, with games to dictate blocksize.

Not necessarily just CPUs, specialized hashing hardware, parameterized with all the computation cores and memory necessary to switch between any of the proposed algos. Proof of Space is a memory hard algo, so instead of a lot of cores they need a lot of memory... Big whoop. 


Both can be turned into heaters if the POW is dominated by miners with the advantage of scale and cheep power. 


Exactly why we should not simply hand more power to miners. Which is what happens if we allow them to dictate blocksize. 
That doesn't mean that crypto is dead, that just means that it becomes yet another tool for the powerful.

This is where solutions like the Lightning Network come in. Settlement of smaller transactions is deferred until they are bundled together to be settled on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is only the complexity of the transaction that impacts its cost. It doesn't matter if the transaction is for .005 BTC or 50 BTC the transaction cost is the same, so it makes more sense to bundle many .005 BTC transactions together and settle them at once. This is an oversimplification but I hope you get the jist.

You are just simply flat wrong about that. The rate of available new data storage and processing power available every year is increasing exponentially. That is not a recipe for any kind of sustainable resistance to centralization. 


No, it is nothing like that. This is the flaw in your thinking, which seems to be focused on existing, static infrastructure. While what we are dealing with is something that is alive and growing and adaptable. 
Every time you create an incentive this also forms the basis of leveraging that incentive, as a meta-incentive, to obtain more of it. And this leads to centralization of power and geometric distribution curves. This is not the dam, this is the very physics which enables one to build dams.

Um... This is basically an un-tested inference. I do not know of you can prove that this relationship holds true with the growth of the user-base. It may very well be that newer users have fewer transactions, for instance. Or that the rate of transactions per user increases with the number of Bitcoin accepting vendors over time.

*Actually* the number of listening nodes matters to miners. Specifically, the number of listening nodes they can connect to compared to their peers. Because this affects how fast they can propagate their own blocks and prevent them from becoming orphaned. 
So, on the one hand, the cost of operating a full (listening) node determines the ease of adding those nodes to the network, and so their number. But on the other hand miners have an economic incentive to connect to as many of those nodes as possible.
It would seem to follow then that a miner would be willing to seek an advantage by *paying* to connect to network nodes, and that the creation of a market is possible.

People have been preaching an end to Moore's Law for a while now, but we still have a path leading up to the 5nm process node and maybe even a little bit beyond. Even so, that just marks the end for silicon, which is all that Moore's Law makes claims about. How long before me are able to commercialize 2D materials like carbon and boron? Who knows. 
But no matter how efficient the chips become there really isn't anything to prevent the highest efficiencies from being claimed by the biggest mining nodes first. Which is critical for getting the best margins. Even a 'heater' application will eventually produce insignificant hashing power unless it is continually upgraded. This may not be very important for someone who just wants to offset heating costs but it is still important in terms of how decentralized mining is.

The evidence is that as the number of Bitcoin users has increased, as shown by transaction volume, the number of full listening nodes has diminished. Everybody can see that. The addition of SPV transactions confounds the ability of this data to explain the decrease but it is easy enough to see that as it has become more costly to operate full listening nodes fewer people are willing to run them. As transaction volume increases this cost is likely to increase. There is nothing tying the increase in transaction volume to technological deflation.

I believe there is a relationship between transaction volume and the cost for running a listening node. As transaction volume increases it becomes more expensive to operate a full listening node in terms of storage and bandwidth. With technological deflation it should become less costly over time to operate these nodes, but I am concerned that there is nothing tying an increase in transaction volume to technological deflation, which it may easily outrun. 


I have addressed it in other comments. Relay nodes still must connect to the larger network and the depth of this connection still affects the rate of propagation. The affect of SPV transactions confounds the data relating to a decrease in full listening nodes. Both the cost for operating the nodes and a removal of the incentive for operating them by the availability of SPV transacitons has contributed to the decline in the number of these nodes. But I still think that it is easy enough to see that as the number of network nodes declines the basic security assumptions of Bitcoin come under greater threat.

Incentivize verifiable bandwidth. This is no different that solving problems for M2M transactions for any autonomous service. The smart contracts can even be structured on a market basis depending on criteria like demand, latency, and up-time.

It is actually the converse that I am arguing. 
Ver is claiming a correlation between block size and the number of full nodes without any evidence. If there were a causal relationship, as he claims, then there would be positive correlation between the two. Correlation by itself does not prove causation, but conversely if you have causation you do also have correlation. 
As it stands we do have correlative evidence to the contrary of Ver's claim. This does not prove the hypothesis that increased user adoption leads to fewer full nodes, particularly since there is also the affect of increased SPV transactions confounding this data. But I do believe that a more reasonable theory has to take into account a cost/benefit analysis for running a node.
a.) Increasing costs in the form of storage and bandwidth act as a disincentive to operate full listening nodes. 
b.) The availability of SPV transactions remove the incentive for maintaining a wallets on a full nodes.
c.) An increase in the rate that transactions occur also increases the cost for operating full nodes in terms of storage and bandwidth.(restatement of point a) 
d.) Technological deflation should reduce the cost for operating full nodes over time, but there is nothing tying the rate if transactions to technological deflation which it would likely outrun.
e.) If the number of full listening nodes declines this increases the risk that Bitcoin's security assumptions will be violated.
f.) Without a concrete incentive for the specific task of operating full listening nodes we risk a tragedy of the commons as the cost for operating those nodes is absorbed by fewer charitable volunteers.
Edit: some words.

Mining hardware has a limited useful life anyway. The silicon has to be changed out periodically with advances in technology.

@_date: 2016-01-25 17:38:32
That is cute, but I am not talking about ASICs. As in the case with Keccak you would need the complexity of a full processor. A hashing motherboard could be stripped down to support as many processors as you can reasonably fit in a form factor. More so than you could get using off-the-shelf GPUs, for instance.
There are efficiencies to be found that are simply not available to the general public. But yes, you can implement a full processor in an ASIC if you have the IP for it.

With each step (16nm -&gt; 10nm -&gt; 7nm -&gt; 5nm -&gt; 4nm) only the first to develop the tech will get the mining profits.  7nm is already coming out a year ahead of schedule (2017) and I expect that 5nm will come ahead of its 2020 schedule as well. 
Will there be a gap where the rest of us can catch up? I don't know.

At that point they may even seek vertical integration and start their own foundries.

Not true. But this is the nature of a tragedy of the commons, that all benefit from a common resource, including those directly responsible for maintaining it. But if this is done exclusively by volunteers it is all too easy to conclude that 'sombody else' can volunteer. 


I am just as lost about what to do about this. 


As long as the cost for operating a node stays in reach of a fair subset of users then, fine. But for scaling to become truly massive then I agree we will have to solve the problem of the division of labor between miners and network operators and how they are compensated. 
But I do not think that any fixed share can fairly represent this division. Because, well, things change. Rather, I expect that it would be more fair to allow a market to develop for network connections. It would require that miners have an incentive to connect to as many nodes as feasible, and not just to each other in order to propagate blocks, and to discover as many new transactions fast as possible. It also requires that the the operation of nodes be verifiable in a manner that defies spoofing so that connections paid for are actually delivering. I doubt that this can be something that is really on the development radar until more pressing issues are resolved. But I hope it is looked at seriously before it becomes a crisis. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:31:55
It is not very exciting given current transaction rates. But as the rate of transactions increases the relay network will falter, or it will be incentivized, Chinese miners will become disadvantaged is it takes them longer to propagate blocks and discover transactions beyond their borders, and more vulnerable links in the network are taken down by governments or banking goons.
It is going to become increasingly important to miners for their own benefit to diversify their connections.

Let's see what that looks like: 
22nm came in 2012 with 14nm on 2014, that is an increase of 2.47
Then Altera comes with 10nm later this year, another increase of 1.96.
Then by 2017 Xylinx will becoming with 7nm, ahead of schedule, another increase of 2.04.
Who really knows when 5nm will be available but that is another increase of 1.96 but the half-node 4nm will probably only be another year with an increase of 1.56
And with each increase of die density also comes an increase of processing speed and efficiency with each step. Should the big miners get most all the advantage from these gains for the next 4 or 5 years? I am thiking they probably will in any case. What is worse is that when productivity gains slow down what we know of the rest of industry is that this is when M&amp;A activity occurs, resulting in even larger conglomerates.

The Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal are neoliberal institutions, they have adopted definitions which suit their political agendas. They consider trade agreements (regulation) to be conducive to trade. The 'freedom' only comes in the form of trade barriers that are easier to navigate by virtue of becoming participants to these regulatory agreements. At the same time these agreements actively bar non-participants which do not meet the agreed upon regulatory requirements such as reporting standards for banking. 
Weak states are excluded from these regulatory regimes because they do not meet the same standards. This is all due to regulated trade, it is only 'free' within a narrowly defined framework.

I understand that contract law requires a substantial legal infrastructure to function. 


A gun is ultimately always part of the equation. 


This is exactly what happens in failed states, and makes the enforcement of contracts unpredictable. My position is that it is better to observe the rule of law, ethically and transparently. Regulation that works to ensure such ethical and transparent dealings is exactly the sort advocated by the likes of Adam Smith.

Yes, I know what you said about this, but that is just so much propaganda. Somalia clearly has virtually no enforcement of regulations and therefore virtually no protections. Hong Kong has more enforced regulation and therefore more protections. The difference is that the rule of law is operable in Hong Kong, allowing businesses to predictably execute contracts.


Such lobbying is a problem that requires a remedy. In the U.S. anyway this would mean at least that we restore the secret ballot to congress. 


Sorry, I thought you knew the difference between power generation and power distribution. I agree that consumers should be able to choose where they source their electric power from.

Whether you call it 'the government' or you call it the SFS, or the ISO or the Bar Association the fact is that governance happens. The organizing principle is that standards are desirable because of the efficiencies they afford. This extends to the kinds of contracts which are tolerable to society.
Just as international industry standards have evolved so has jurisprudence. It is a matter of history and culture which dictates what is more tolerable and less tolerable due to the fact that we have iterated it. I happens that governments have the role they do because, collectively, we have chosen to embed much of or institutional memory in them. 
Even if through a perfection of neoliberal machinery all these functions are farmed out to privately owned bodies it is still a de facto 'government'. If you comply with their institutional guidance and from that enjoy the kind of efficiencies that everyone else does it will likely cost you less than if you tried to go it your own through non-compliance. 
In reality though, governance requires a mix of public and private partnerships, just like we have today. Because we have already iterated guild systems mixed with sovereign rule and merchant organizations to get to where we are today. 


You mistake me for an idealist. I hold no such belief. But I recognize that in the absence of such a body, another will arise to take its place. It is not that I, personally, think that this is the way it should be, but that history informs me this is the way it will be.
You may continue to model your desired utopia contrary to the lessons of history but I speculate that as you act on such a model it will prove to be costly to you.

The the index of economic freedom is basically made up by the neoliberal Heritage Foundation, we have already covered that. It describes well-ordered (regulated) economies. Of which Somalia certainly is not. 
I am not really seeing any conflict with my description and your bullet points. Somalia *used to be* socialist and now they are not. They have formed some transitional governing bodies becuause they do not have a formal government. But if they can keep the peace between the regional landlords they may yet be able to achieve some stability. And with enough regulation they may yet be able to climb the ranks of the Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom.

It is hardly an apples-to-apples comparison. Hong Kong's economy is concentrated at the top of the value chain, where the most value is added.

Believe it or not, courts have regulations, and even private regulators will, as part of a best practice, will require of industries that they follow certain protocols due to the way courts and municipal record keeping functions. Do you remember [MERS]( and the robo-signing scandal? This is an example where a private company tried to bypass regulation. It was streamlined alright, so much so that it did not reliably preserve the provable and complete documentation needed to securitize mortgages. As a result many contracts were thrown into disarray because there was no effective oversight to ensure that state and county recordation regulations were followed. It is not a matter of Legal infrastructure and regulation being the same thing, but regulation exists in part to ensure that that infrastructure can function effectively. 


And yet. aggression would continue to occur for other purposes, despite being prohibited. That is why.

Have you ever worked for an ISO 9000 company? I am presuming not, because if you had you would know very well that such standards are very quite literally regulations. They regulate the workflow of every aspect of quality management.
But it does still ultimately come down to the gun. ISO 9001 lawsuits are numerous. Should such a certified company fail to comply with the standard while holding out that they do comply with the standard this is actionable. In the event of a judgement a court may order that assets be forcibly transferred to the plaintiffs. 
ISO standards themselves enfold numerous government regulations, violation of which may also be actionable. Which, also may come down to a gun in order to be enforced. Even such standards as weights and measures are de facto regulation. If products are marketed as being of a certain weight and purity when they are not, this again is actionable. 


But this is the thing. Governence arises. Should you ever achieve such a vacuum it will quickly be filled, and probably not to your liking if you are not the one to fill it. 
You may not see a need for violence but as long as there is someone, anyone who recognizes that it may confer them some advantage you will have to deal with it.

This is not a treatise against regulation. The Heritage Foundation just wants regulation to be more efficient. To be less costly, take less time, and to be less complex. 
In order for this to happen for international commerce there has to be agreement on these regulations to eliminate duplicate and conflicting requirements. This is effectively a *consolidation* of regulatory requirements. 
Any elimination of regulation advocated by the Heritage Foundation is a tacit acceptance of the consolidation of regulatory frameworks with the only criteria that they be simpler, take less time, and be less costly. But this is only true for participants to those agreements who can meet the requirements of those agreements. The use of certain permitted standards for product fitness, banking, shipping, etc. Standards make commerce more efficient. 
Those weak states which do not promote the meeting of these standards, even defy them, serve to exclude their citizens from participation in these commercial channels. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 03:56:33
That's true, but they are not paying nearly what the home gamers are. What's more, that is their only business. When they decide to expand their operations they just add miners. But for someone who is using a miner as a source of heat for an industrial process they have to expand the whole process to add more 'heaters'. And there are limits to such an expansion that are unique to each business. Limitations not faced by the professional miners. Such an application will never be able to keep pace with the miners. It is much more likely that a large miner will profit from selling waste heat to industrial tenants then 'heater' applications will ever decentralize mining.

Not really. If the silicon in hashing utility heaters is not continually upgraded it will necessarily represent a diminishing segment of the total hashing power. Which makes it useless for decentralization purposes and can only guarantee diminishing returns even for 'free' power. It can only have the desire effect once Moore's Law peters out. Which I would not bank on.

Let's say that an electric water heating element is 4500 watts with a 2% duty cycle. That is 64.8 KWH/month, and with electric power cost at $0.1/KWH the monthly cost would be $6.48. 
Now, you really need a full 4500 watts of capacity to heat up the water as it is used so you can not get by with a mere 90 watt heating element even if it runs 24/7. It would take to long to heat the tank back up after someone takes a shower. This means cramming three and a half S7 Antminers worth of silicon into a water tank and running it only 2% of the time. 
For one thing that is one premium priced water tank. Let's say you can get the cost down to $2800. At best you are going to get about about $10 out of it, total, before you start having to pay a net positive on the electric again. But even as you continue to run it just as a 'heater', the portion of hashing power it contributes is getting smaller and smaller.
You could then get the next latest-greatest upgraded silicon for your heater but it will cost about $8,000 next winter when it first comes out. You'll maybe make $160 off of it before you have to pay a net positive for electricity again for your hot water tank. Unless maybe you run it at a 100% duty cycle to heat your ventilated attic or something, then it might just pay for itself.

Oh, you are referring to those cherry-picked spurious correlations. Nothing more than statistical slight-of-hand. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:41:04
I just did a simulation to compare the sensitivity of the two correlation tests to the proposed price manipulation scenario. The simulation was set up to compare a pure stochastic against a simulation of Tether creation. And a 'manipulated' stochastic against the same simulated Tether creation. The 'manipulation' was set up so that there was a value increase effect whenever the value of the stochastic process dropped below a certain level. What I found was that neither one of the simple correlation tests were sensitive enough to reliably detect the difference. Now I am convinced it would take a much more sophisticated approach to show systematic manipulation, or the lack thereof. It would probably take something like Hidden Markov Modeling to unravel it.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:01:59


I reiterate. There is no such thing as a reliable 'permanent sign-on'. This is not a secure arrangement. It has to be managed. Connections can get lost, data can be spoofed, and if you have a dumb contract that just reacts to what it is being fed without verifying it things can go bad very quickly. This is why you need setups like witnesses and oracles for interfacing with data outside of a blockchain. What's more, a single connection is fragile, you really need several connections to several banks. Now this is no big thing if you are talking just about connecting to servers at data centers, but at banks or not like that. They have several different systems that they have to manage, and it takes a person, or persons to authorize procedures. One day blockchains will allow all this to be managed more seamlessly and automatically, but today is not that day. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:49:03
Okay, I see what you are saying. You are saying that it is not as sensitive. This is not the same as claiming that using percentages makes no sense, because the point of the analysis is to show the differential between the claim of the conspiracy theory, which uses cherry-picked, spurious correlations, versus an aggregate of daily trading over one year's activity. 
Even so, were there to be any significant correlation this might indicate a causal relationship. But there isn't. If anything was found it was a *negative* correlation. Which rather debunks the claim that the creation of tethers is a prop to Bitcoin market valuation, if anything it has a very slight retarding effect on price, if you can say it has any effect at all. If you don't look at this effect as a daily differential, however, the effect of funds coming in from the outside on the scale of the market over the course of a year is all you can see, which drives both Bitcoin market valuation as well as Tether creation.

That is a claim that can only be supported by cherry picking data though. Any time you have two different time series there are going to be instances where spurious correlations crop up. But the correct way to show that such a correlation is significant is to look at it over the entire sample set that is of significant length.

How is the USD valued? Basically, it is valued by its purchasing power, and when it comes to monitoring the value of USD by a continuous metric this is done against a weighted basket of currencies. The DXY
The fantasy of Bitcoin maximalism is not really useful for any kind of realistic economic model. Tiered money exist for a reason. There is no single instrument that can be applied flatly to all situations. 
In reality Bitcoin will persist amid a constellation of financial instruments with different properties. Take for instance how Bitcoin may interact with Lightning Network. The use of payment channels means that whereas the total supply of Bitcoin may remain fixed, liquidity can still be managed within LN. The amount of liquidity available is determined by a market feedback mechanism. Where there is less demand liquidity the fees that liquidity providers may demand will be low, and when there is greater demand liquidity providers will be able to demand higher fees. 
This may be considered analogous to how bond interest rates operate. When interest rates are lower it is easier to borrow, thereby expanding liquidity. And when interest rates are higher this tends to contract liquidity. Perhaps contracts will evolve to allow for longer term fee rate and liquidity guarantees if there is a need for it. Or hedging instruments like transaction fee futures, or liquidity futures to be used by large liquidity providers.

Because this actually what gives you a reference point. It establishes a norm against which you may test your hypothesis. 


The fact that Tethers are created in batches gives you an indication of deposit activty. This is actually how Tether is supposed to work. Tether creation is based on an algorithm which responds to market demand. But it is not issued until it actually shows up in a trader's account. Tether creation and issuance are two different things.


And this is *supposed* to occur in anticipation of demands for liquidity.

I think we have been talking a past each other a bit here. I see your point about the methodology now. But I am not convinced that the alternative is any better. It does not really detect any effect on Bitcoin market valuation because Tether creation is driven by the same influences. There is really no other objective measure that I can see which proves a causal relationship going from Tether creation to Bitcoin market valuation. And it is actually only positive proof that matters. Negative proof should really not be incumbent on anyone.

And so this is the problem with all private blockchains. All Venezuela has to do though is to share this blockchain with its trading partners so they can independently verify its state.

The problem with that is that you can not actually own a Tether wallet that allows you to independently verify any of that. Tether can only operate on a centralized exchange where it can act as a market maker. Only the exchange verifies Tether. Until someone can crack that problem it's a moot point. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:51


Nobody is saying that it is false, just that it does not tell you anything meaningful about the affect of Tether issues on market valuation. 


It is actually a pretty normal statistical test. This is actually why you have probably seen the conspiracy theorists apply the same test. This analysis is intended to debunk the conspiracy theorists.  
It is well known that when you compare two time series like this that there will be spurious correlations that pop up from time to time. It is also a pretty well known bit of statistical slight-of-hand to use such cherry picked data to spin just about any narrative you want to. But small sample sets are not usually as valid as larger sample sets. You risk a very common pitfall of statistical analysis called 'over fitting' if you rely on sample sets that are too short a time period, in the case of time series data, or data that has too few samples. 
The goal of the analysis in the article is to demonstrate that over a larger sample set the thesis of price manipulation over time does not really hold. That because a longer time series was used, this analysis is more valid than an 'over fit' analysis that uses less data selected specifically to support a pre-determined conclusion.

@_date: 2018-02-04 14:07:02
That is basically how the whitepaper explains it. But in practice it seems to be a little more complex if you look at the [Transparency Page]( It looks like issuance is in tranches of, I guess, $1 million on the Omni layer and some other amount on the Ether layer. It is not entirely clear to me. So, it looks like when dollars come in they are not issued immediately until a certain threshold is met. 
But then there is another amount on the Omni layer that is quarantined. This is $30,950,010 USDT that was discovered [stolen from one of the Tether treasury wallets]( 
So it is not quite real-time $1 for USDT issuance.

More gibberish, that is kind of like saying your trades should not matter because they are such a tiny portion of the market. But the market is composed of many traders just like you. Just as we get from year to year by a matter of days. 


That is not how weighing works. In this case the samples are equal weight. 
The baloon/pool analogy is complete rubbish. If you change the amount of air in the baloon by a random percentage every day the level of the pool will also change by a very tiny percentage, but always in the same direction as the changes of the balloon. The correlation coefficient would be 100%.

Kind of like you like to try to call cherry-picked data **composite reference points**.


You are right. It is not accurate to say that Tether's algorithm necessarily creates Tether during periods of "high deposit activity". The algorithm creates Tethers in anticipation of demands on liquidity. 


The algorithm does not only authorize new tethers, it also destroys them. 


Same to you buddy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:29:23


You could say the same thing about Bitcoin versus many different cryptocurrencies. This does not reveal anything unique about the relationship between Bitcoin and Tether. 


If this were actually the case you would be able to see it in daily price movements over the same time period. 


This is just gibberish. I think we can agree that a change from 100 to 101 does not **mean** the same thing as a change from 1000 to 1001. They both change by the exact same amount. But the difference in what that change **means** is captured when you say that one changes by 1% and the other changes by .1%.

But the money is not being put directly into Bitcoin, it is being put into Tether. From there it can go into anything in the exchange that is paired with USD. The price of USDT doesn't go up because new supply is created to roughly match USD deposits, and Tether acts as its own market maker. 
Generally, as USD has come into exchanges it has flowed into Bitcoin and other cryptos, but at any time traders may decide to sell cryptos and hold USD for a while. There are absolutely no guarantees for market valuation on any time scale for any asset. It is all driven by whatever the collective belief of market participants is at any given time. 
The fact of an inelastic supply makes the prospect of value fluctuations even worse. Supply inelastic asset classes are widely known to have extreme value fluctuations because instantaneous demand is difficult to predict.

In part, by promoting exchange between instruments and experimenting with ways to make them work together. 
To misquote Voltaire; if alt-coins did not exist, Bitcoin would have to invent them. It serves to demonstrate the principal of ecological diversity that is a feature-not-a-bug of crypto-currencies. Should any attack, economic, social, or technological, be proven successful this informs an immune response through the various projects' developers, ensuring that the most secure and usable systems survive. 
Having a plethora of payment options helps crypto-currencies to remain fungible by routing around the hostile infrastructure of legacy systems. And it is this that helps to drive value in this growth phase regardless of any real or perceived inflation. The economic balance is that between inflation via proliferating instruments and shifting market share, and crypto-currencies are demonstrably siphoning market share from legacy banking and currency systems, with plenty of room to grow.

I do not dispute that there are unanswered questions about Tether's viability. I just think that it has been demonstrated that Tether's influence on market valuation has been overstated. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:19:50
Well... As Tethers are issued to traders they use them. This is pretty expected according to the way Tether is supposed to work, as money comes into the market. The conspiracy theory claim is that the issue of Tethers was inflated in order to produce an outsized Bitcoin price movement. The statistical analysis in the article demonstrates that this is not the case. Over the course of the last year there there is no significant correlation between percent daily changes in Bitcoin price and percent daily changes of Tether issues. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:13:31


Okay, let's say those data points are left in, the correlation is still pretty low at -0.17168. And it is a negative correlation at that. Which would be an indication of Tether issues having a slightly retarding effect on price... You are not helping your argument here.
  
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:55:12
You are right. There are degrees of corellation. The degree of correlation can be expressed as a coefficient where 1 is completely corellated, basically all the ups and downs match up, down to 0 where nothing matches up. And it can even be negative, which means that the ups and downs tend to go in the opposite direction. 
The analysis in the article showed that the daily percent Bitcoin price change compared to the percent change in the amount of USDT issued on the same day over the course of a year only has a correlation of -0.08335, which is slightly negative, but it is a very small correlation. Which means that the daily change in the amount of Tethers issued does not have any significant effect on the daily price fluctuations of Bitcoin.

One might think that blockchain technology could make the accounting more automatic and transparent. But in this case it is not so simple. It requires interfacing with legacy banking infrastructure in a manner that will be accepted by their own accounting practices. Then, doing the same on the exchange end. It is not simply a matter of creating something that only requires verification on a blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:40:55
But there isn't a correlation, that is what the analysis shows. 
Think of it this way. Some days a trader deposits USD to add to his USDT position, and also decides to buy some Bitcoin, but he is not always selling all of his new USDT to buy Bitcoin. And on other days he may decide to sell some Bitcoin even though he also decides to deposit USD and add to his USDT position. On the other hand he may decide to reduce his USDT position by withdrawing USD. On those days he may also decide to buy some Bitcoin. But on other days he may withdraw some USD and also sell some Bitcoin.
All of these different possibilities can be happening with different traders every single day, in different combinations. This is why Bitcoin price does not always go up when new Tethers are issued, and it does not always go down when USD is withdrawn and the amount of Tethers is reduced.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:28:01


The basic idea is to provide a layer of isolation between U.S. government regulators and foreign exchanges. It is supposed to make things easier for their users that want to trade in USD paired assets but have difficulty sending USD to foreign exchanges because of the regulatory uncertainty of banks regarding cryptocurrency trading. 
The way it is supposed to work is that every time a trader deposits USD they are issued a roughly equivalent value of USDT. The value of USDT is kept close to a $1 to 1USDT peg through Tether acting as its own market maker. 
Based on one interpretation of IRS regulations it was once thought that you could trade crypto to crypto as a like-kind exchange and so avoid taxable events in trading them. But that is all over now that the new tax bill has passed in the U.S. which clarifies that property transfers do not qualify as like-kind exchange. So there is no avoiding taxable events in trading them.

@_date: 2018-02-04 16:20:02

**They** don't spend the tethers. Tethers are spent by the traders they are issued to. Tethers are created in tranches of $1 million on the Omni platform. But they are only issued to traders as deposits come in. So at any time there can be a difference of between $0 and $1 million Tether that have been created but not issued. Even so, if more than $1 million in deposits come in over the course of a day there is not going to be a lot of time pass between when Tethers are created and when they are issued. It is not really going to have much of an effect on the analysis.

You mean you have to cherry pick the data so that you only look at times when there is a lot of deposit activity. 


Tether is *issued* when it is made available to traders who have made deposits. The conspiracy theory claim does not attempt to differentiate the two. In any case, if there is a difference between Tether issues and deposits 
 over time this would show up as an outsized influence on the market over time. It does not, as the daily data shows--over time.

This is **not the same thing** as Bitcoin addresses. So on one hand the apparent centralization of economic control could be worse because one person may actually control several wallets/addresses.

But you are making an argument about Venezuela's motivations for creating El Petro.

If you are concerned about the possibility of fraud then take your funds out of Tether. Take your funds out of Bitfinex.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:22:42
We are in agreement as far as Tether's influence on market valuations. But when it comes to corellation it is not actually the level that is meaningful. If you are trying to say that tether issues *changes* Bitcoin market valuation than you have to look at it in terms of that *change*. 
Expressing that change in terms of percentage is done to normalize for scale effects. There is a great deal of correlation between Bitcoin price and total Tether issues over the course of the year in terms of scale. But this does not tell you anything about the causal relationship between the two as this is simply an effect of the market getting bigger as a whole. This is why, in order to get to the nugget of that relationship you have to control for scale.
So looking at the relationship between Bitcoin market valuation and Tether issues in this way makes a lot of sense. This does two things; it looks at the thing you are actually trying to measure, which is how a change in Tether issues and the change in Bitcoin market valuation relate to one another; and it normalizes scale so that  this comparison is not swamped out by scale effects. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:57:48

Lol. That is not how markets work. The issuance of Tethers and the buying of Bitcoins are two different things. It is perfectly reasonable that on some days a trader will *both* add to a USDT position by transferring USD into an account *and also* choose to *sell* Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:34:36
You are correct. As the author states, his analysis is not proof that such manipulation has not occurred. But rather than beginning with an hypothesis, the conspiracy theorists seem to have begun with a conclusion, and have choosen to spin up a narrative based upon that conclusion based upon spurious correlation. Leaving competing theories to prove a negative. Which is also a bit of a red flag for cognitive slight-of-hand. 
Even assuming there is market activity peculiar to Tether liquidity events the conspiracy theories already presume a chain of causation that could be explained in other ways. Tether's liquidity algorithm *should* anticipate demand in response to market activity, authorizing Tethers in advance of the need to issue them. As well, it acts as its own market maker to preserve the peg. These are normal, expected functions of the service and it would actually not be surprising to observe artifacts of this activity in trading data. But the fact that in aggregate Tether does not appear to be exerting any appreciable pressures on the market is rather remarkable.

This has to do with a timeline of expectation for improvements in mining hardware, and therefore the hashrate, which underlies the security of the blockchain. 
A case has been made that due to failure of Moore's law we may expect that the advantage of Chinese miners will be eroded, and mining centralization will solve itself as better mining hardware is more evenly distributed to a broader market. But nothing has failed, Moore's law is continuing at pace, and with each new generation of hardware the advantaged position of first movers is further consolidated. Which I believe will continue to be the case in the years to come.

Bitcoin is poorly designed to reduce Gini. 
What it does seem to do though is to redistribute *risk*. That is to say, those most heavily invested in Bitcoin take on greater risk. So, even as the Bitcoin Gini goes higher the riskiest positions are at the top of the distribution. 
This is the inverse of more traditional investments. Small investors only have access to few markets, where risk is increased in the form of percentage of fees, and limited acces to more  privileged assets. While large investors have access to all markets, including privileged markets where risk is minimized.
So as large investors increase their exposure to Bitcoin they actually assume risk proportional to their exposure. There is no bailout for Bitcoin. There is no burning down of the casino and re-issuing of chips.

That is not a claim that I am making.


But growing will pushing decentralisation (more need to run nodes), making bitcoin core more useful (implementing HD wallet, making easy to use, etc..). Incentivise the node can help too, optimisation of the code to reduce the bandwidth can help too (see thin blocks).
I think that incentivizing nodes is key.


Again, this is not a claim that I am making. I am rightfully pointing out that there is, at present, nothing to correlate technological deflation with the potential demand for transactions. And that this relationship **can** be unsustainable unless such sustainability is engineered in. 
If nodes become too expensive to operate from sheer size of the blockchain that has to be downloaded every day then there will be fewer nodes. Even with total growth of the system nodes will become concentrated in the hands of operators that have to tie them to complex business models in order to maintain them, and will be relegated to geographies with higher bandwidth connectivity. All that is even before we get to the actual message traffic. 
I think it makes sense to offload much of the message traffic to sidechains and focus on Bitcoin itself as a settlement layer, the 'central' bank so to speak. Which will have to grow, certainly. But you can not simply *assume* that technological deflation will always be sufficient to prevent bottlenecks. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:03:19
It is still a problem for nodes that support the network by accepting incoming connections. True, you could use a proxy, but then you are paying twice for bandwidth. While it sucks to have your connection individually DDOSed (It has happened to me) it will suck a lot more if the number of nodes accepting incoming connections falls to a level where they could conceivably be simultaneously DDOSed. 
And I have seen that it is often the case that people choose not to run listening nodes for the very reason that their specific IP address is broadcast, and placed them at risk for attack. There should be an incentive to offset the risk that they are taking, and the cost they are incurring.

@_date: 2015-11-23 20:53:20
I actually think that this could be a tricky technical problem to keep the bandwidth from being spoofed. 
But once it can be measured reliably nodes should be able to set the reward level just as miners do, in order to provide an efficient market for the service. I expect that the way it would work would be in the form of 'transmission fees' just as we have transaction fees. In this way allowing the nodes themselves to negotiate the market price, if the fee is set too high they don't get the traffic. It would actually be fueled by nodes that have to charge a negative fee in order to connect to enough peers to get the bandwidth they need, like mining pools that have to keep connection speed up so that blocks don't get orphaned. 
On the one hand, the whole network is in jeopardy if the number of full nodes drops too low. It opens up the possiblity of the network being brought down by simultaneous DDOS on all nodes that receive incoming connections. But on the other hand, mining pool operators would be able to pay for as much network as they think they need. Or anyone, for that matter would be able to pay for the network just by setting their 'transmission fee' to a negative value. 
This is all pretty off-the-cuff on my part, feel free to punch holes in it. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 16:49:47

@_date: 2015-11-13 02:23:11
There is nothing to secure if there is no network. Under a regime of bandwidth dictated by as much transaction volume as will present itself, how are network nodes to be compensated?
One may argue Moore's Law yadda yadda but there is nothing tying transaction volume to technological deflation to ensure that it is actually a sustainable relationship. If nodes become expensive to run, and more bandwidth-limited reaches of Internet topography go dark, then the operation of the network itself becomes more centralized.

ASIC resistance does not really have much to do with centralization though. The use of ASICs is just an optimization strategy. The way that this leads to optimization is that as an optimization strategy the development and deployment of ASICs represent a high bar. This allows those who can perform the optimization to have an out-sized advantage over those who can not cost effectively perform the optimization. 
What is being proposed here is to make optimization even more difficult. I fail to see how this can be expected the move the needle on centralization the other way. Those with the resources will learn to employ a hardware configuration that works best, and then they will scale it. In this case scale and exclusivity are still what drives centralization. Unless that positive feedback condition can be broken you still don't move the needle on centralized mining.

I am suggesting that the state act as a clearing house for Bitcoin smart contracts. These contracts would not even have to be settled in real time, they could be settled daily. Sure, it could be done on Etherium as well, the state can replicate the taxpayer-facing function of a 'visa gift card system' without completely re-inventing the wheel, and with comparable, if not better, security. 
But I am sorry, a Visa gift card system simply can not handle the size of cash transactions that are involved with the daily deposits of vendors, and their payments to each other, which is whom this system would primarily serve. The Fed does not appear to be amenable to it and Visa would balk via their TAC. 
As well, the system should reduce the amount of raw cash that is changing hands as it absorbs some of these vendor-to-vendor transactions as well as tax payments. I am suggesting that the system could be further expanded to absorb at least some of the consumer-to-vendor transactions as well.

If the bank were engaged in writing and buying IOUs then yes, they would still be creating money out of thin air. Much as California did in recent memory, and which Illinois is till doing... Even without forming an official bank. Effectively issuing their own defacto currency. Which is fine, as long as there is enough growth in the ecosystem to absorb the issuance of new IOUs.
In the case of using bitcoin as a medium for deposits and withdrawals, instead of issuing IOUs, one of the main purposes for the state would be to serve as a sort of lender of last resort to underwrite a limit on exchange rate risk. But it is hard to know the extent of risk with a supply-inelastic asset class like Bitcoin. And unless there is an all-Bitcoin ecosystem there has to be exchange rate risk for someone. 
This would not necessarily be the case with smart contracts, which could be used more-or-less as instruments for deposits and receipts backed directly by depositor's cash. minus a dunnage for running the system. And then traded directly between depositors, which would include the state. With the state as the official exchanger of those depository receipts to and from cash. The more   participants there are the less need for doing cash exchanges, and the more efficiently it can be run. With the state accepting the risk for loss of actual cash deposits. 
It is not a bank in the traditional sense, just more of a depository institution. But should there be a need for different types of transactions it would just be a matter of introducing the contracts to make them work.

So what is to keep big miners from having custom GPU boards made which are 10x better than the GPU boards that you can get? They still enjoy economies of scale that you can not hope to touch. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 06:15:47


What are you going to change? I suppose you could use a more memory intensive algo, but then the big miners just make boards with more memory on them. At every turn it is their scale that provides the advantage, there is no technology that can be adopted that will deny them a cost advantage compared to a hobbyist. After a few iterations all the hardware options get covered. Certainly, the big miners won't like having to put out the capital for equipment, and some of them might even wash out... But that only results in *greater* centralization if there are *fewer* *bigger* miners. 
It is a futile exercise. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:46:07

You are referring to 'ASIC' resistance, which does not really touch the issue of centralization in the general sense. Currently, the most advanced ASICs are in the hands of the big miners so I can see that it is easy to make the leap that ASICs cause centralization. But this is not the case. 
It doesn't matter what the technology is if it is cheaper to obtain and implement at a large scale versus a small scale. This is true no matter what resource a particular algo intensifies. And once a range of parameters is known a generalized computing architecture can be arrived at to speed the optimization-- and I expect that this would most cost effective for those who implement it at scale. 
It does not really even matter very much at all if the hardware is even at a slight cost atvantage at scale because there are so many other factors that result in out-sized scale advantage. For instance, industrial electric costs versus commercial or residential costs. There are only so many miners that can buy industrial power in Wenatchee, WA or Liaoning Province, or pay the chip foundries and fab shops in Shenzhen to provide them with custom wares. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:40:19
It would seem that there is a balance to be struck, which in any case requires a consensus. 
In either case it seems that mining is doomed to become more centralized. Should the operation of the network become more centralized as well? If centralization is something that should be minimized then how do we keep the operation of the network from becoming more centralized as it becomes more resource intensive? I do not think that anyone has adequately addressed this issue.

The trick here is ensuring that unique voters are bound to their voter registration, while at the same time preventing the voters from being identified by their vote. and keeping registrations from changing hands. 
Exposing information about how individual voters vote is tantamount to the creation of a market, and allows costs to be imposed on voters positions.
This is what happened with lobbyist influence in the US Congress when the secret ballot process was ended in 1970. While it purports to serve to open the process of government, what it actually does is to create a market for individual Representative's positions. Since that happened there has been an explosion of lobbyist influence on Congress.

Should the 'End the Fed' chanters get their way there would be nothing between us and the BIS, which would be at least a powerful and less accountable to the US. 
Public banking has been a powerful tool to keep the private banks in check. It has made capital more available in places like North Dakota and even Costa Rica. And has kept Fed banks like Citi and JPM from running roughshod. 
Imagine if Citi and JPM instead of being Fed banks, if they were under the aegis of the BIS... Right now the Fed has its fingers in the BIS, and we want them to remain a powerful influence there.

This is precisely why I suggest that the state step in, as a buffer between the taxpayers ant the Fed. Fed banks are interfering in this case with the operation of businesses which are legal in the state of Colorado. The Fed is seeking to stifle the formation, and operation of a capital market.
It would be a departure from the norm for the state to form a depository institution but it is far from revolutionary. North Dakota and Puerto Rico have formed their own banks out of the necessity of being under-served by the Fed for reasons of geography, and to adequately represent local capital markets with banking services.
Today those local government banks have more-or-less been entirely subsumed by the Fed, and can not operate today as they once did. But I find  it is entirely reasonable to expect that Colorado could operate a state-owned bank, albeit with a very limited charter as a depository institution to do the same. Colorado businesses are unquestionably under served by Feb banking, not for reasons of geography, but certainly for lack of interest in the needs of these local businesses. And at worst (likely) for directly antagonistic political purposes. So yes. it would be politically risky for the Colorado legislators to take such a stand, but here is where we go back to the bread-and-butter issue. Do they just go along with the status quo and hope for things to get better with federal decriminalization, or do they do what they can to help local businesses and their own state to prosper economically?
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:31:28
Yes, they are all part of the Federal Reserve system. But, as originally conceived, the BND was not a Federal Reserve bank. If a State were to do something similar today it would be met with quite a bit of resistance. But it has been done.
Through swaps and other agreements even foreign banks are brought in line with the Fed. Should it become necessary they can be cut off from other banks who have also accepted the same agreements. This keeps them in line.  So for practical reasons it is most likely that any such state-owned bank would also be brought into compliance even though it doesn't have to be formed that way.
What Colorado would have to do is to form such a bank with a very limited charter, so as not to appear a threat to the Fed. But for it to have any chance remaining independent it would have to de-facto issue its own currency. The fungibility of said currency would be limited. Exchanges would have to be implemented somehow, and regulation for formal agreements... Sound familiar?
Bitcoin and smart-contracts would seem a natural fit for such a state-owned or state-chartered enterprise. Which would be a great boost to Bitcoin. But the more functional it is the more of a threat it is, and the more it will be attacked. The challenge for lawmakers would be to craft the bank in such a way the state would not immediately be buried in an avalanche of lawsuits and regulatory action.

I suppose they could use Visa's systems but that does not really address the cash bottleneck, and I think their overhead would be higher. They would also have to deal with all of Visa's TAC, which could be problematic in that it keeps the Fed's fingers in the pie. 
The point being to create a buffer between taxpayers and the Fed. Bitcoin offers the kind of infrastructure for managing the states smart contracts, taking care of dunnage, allowing depositors to exchange funds at will, pay their taxes, and keep their cash safe once it is deposited. A 'consumer' contract could be added to the system as well, perhaps with lower spending limits that could be used with participating vendors incorporating loyalty programs, etc...

The result. it seems, is that the Fed is forcing Colorado to create a parallel banking system. Colorado could do what North Dakota did in 1919, and form a state-owned bank. 
Over the years, the Fed has reigned in the BND and I expect that they think they could do the same in Colorado if a state-owned bank should be formed. But I doubt that states getting the idea that they can start their own banks is a preferred outcome for the Fed. For one thing, it may allow for interstate commerce that cuts the Fed out of the loop between States with their own banking systems.

So, what I hear you saying is that only the wealthy will be directly exposed to Bitcoin exchange rate volatility and the poor will not be as exposed. 
I expect that as long as the Bitcoin exchange rate continues to increase the Bitcoin Gini will also increase. But there is a limit to this growth, at most, determined by the growth of the economy as a whole. At some point the growth of a rising Bitcoin economy will clash with the larger deflationary economy and the limits of Bitcoin growth will become defined. At this point I would expect the Bitcoin Gini to decrease as those holdings are pushed out into the larger economy.

You rightly point out the problems with a state-issued currency. I was just providing a corner case for such a pathway. But thank you for helping to make my point.
It would be the case that a state is issuing its own currency if it produces its own debt instruments that are then exchaged. And this is problematic for the reasons you cite.  I believe it is also the case that a state could operate a depository institution that is backed by cash deposits which could function substantially like a 'visa gift card system'. Except that that since it is making its own decisions, as determined by its own lawmakers, instead of following Visa's Fed-dictated TAC it can handle cash transactions of a size, frequency, and from the party of its choosing. I further postulate that the state could act as an agent to facilitate transactions between the participants of its system which would reduce the total amount of raw cash transactions that would otherwise have to occur, increasing the security of its taxpayers, and possibly even reducing their operating costs.
I postulate that this system can be facilitated through the use of smart contracts, either using Bitcoin, or another blockchain like Etherium. I think this would be a boost to any such system. Or course, the state could implement its own blockchain but I think there are advantages to using an established blockchain.

Yes, it is absurd. Because, at a certain point you must have some inflation for any currency to be issued. At one point a certain amount is circulating, be it zero, or a greater amount, then if you wish there to be more of it you must inflate the supply. If there is greater demand for the currency than is being supplied then it will increase in value compared to other mediums of exchange, as in the case of Bitcoin. 
But, for a new currency such as Bitcoin there has to be sufficient supply to feed network effects. So, there has to be a balance. As a supply-inelastic asset class this balance is difficult to reach because demand is variable, which results in wide price swings. As it turns out, the math is not actually all that simple.

DVA may be better on the matter of method effectiveness, but not necessarily for use effectiveness.

No, I don't miss your point. I just think you are wrong.

I can see the price taking maybe a $700 hit due to the uncertainty and then popping back up again. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:54:48
LOL it was only a month ago that everyone was excited about $2300.
Welcome to Bitcoin.

Average tx fee in the last block was $3.18

I am asking you to quantify the difference in this case, specifically...
It is your claim.

I would venture that the price of such connections would be compliance with certain banking regulations... Like all of them.

This is a bug, not a feature, it gives global banking a foothold. Try untangling it and the ultimate response will be an intervention via the New Zealand military. If you can take it over, they can take it over.

The users of Bitcoin do not pay for inflation, they pay transaction fees. Inflation is not a fee. Miners incur expenses in order to earn block bounties and fees.
There is not accounting for total assets as it relates to Bitcion, so 'market cap' is the best we can do. But as far as the expenses incurred by BoA, those expenses are not just incurred on their market cap, but on the total amount of assets they manage.

Sorry, but no. Not really. It's a misnomer. You are talking about Neoliberalism. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:32:45
So, what is your claim (speculation), based on simple math, of what the value of Bitcoin would be ex inflation? $440,491,500?
That seems rather absurd given that there would be no Bitcoin in circulation.

This is interesting since Soylent has stopped accepting Bitcoin. Once they adopted a subscription model there was no good way for them to do monthly drafts for subscription payments via Bitcoin.

Just hang on, I think we may have another week of this before it jumps $100 again. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:03:12
I can see it dropping as much as maybe $80 in the interim, but the more likely scenario is that we are on the way to $4000 by the end of July.

I don't really doubt you, but is you want to sell it I might suggest you be more explicit. DCA is a pretty low bar for your average passive investor. Because it is easy, it is more likely they will actually follow through with it. Now if you want to make the case for a little more involved process it bears showing the exact advantage as well as a walk-through of how to do it.

@_date: 2017-06-26 17:52:16
That doesn't exactly explain a whole lot. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:06:22
Not necessarily. Ether seems to be behaving as a beta trade for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:19:09
WTF does this have to do with Bitcoin?
