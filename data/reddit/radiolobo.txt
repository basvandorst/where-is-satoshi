If you aren't already mining, it will take A LOT of money to start now

Looks like an easy way to loose some coins

I'm happy it went down and then sad it went back up, I need to buy cheaper

How did I miss this earlier

This. When I first heard about Bitcoin I read up on it and found out what it is and what it does. Learned things like buying some and getting it out of exchanges and into my ledger nano. When I told my friends about Bitcoin the only thing they care about is the price. That's all they care about.

I can relate

I went to a local comic convention with a friend who's really into comics. I am not. Every time my friend got into a conversation with sellers I would just ask "will you accept Bitcoin?". Every single one said they have heard about it but wouldn't accept it at this time. I believe we are still in the early stages

Scam bruh

I'm not worried, I'll take another chance at $3k

Most fear what they do not understand

I've used lightning to buy some gift cards and it's pretty cool. Its fast and it works. I wonder just how many people are buying BTC blindly without knowing it's true capabilities
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:23:05
I remember when they were saying this about $6k 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:27:01
This is very cool
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:57:45
Cool I might check it out
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:41:02
I'll be stopping by there soon. Know any spots to buy a beer with BTC? Lol
