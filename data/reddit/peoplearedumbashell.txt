Awesome! I actually found it by searching the playstore for trezor

Aaaaaah ok. That's where I was confused. So my wallet "should" handle the fee for me by asking about it. I don't necessarily need to do it on my own...?

Airbitz is pretty cool and easy to use. The CEO seems like a decent guy too. The app shows local stores that accept bitcoin and locations of ATMs.

How do transaction fees work? How do I calculate or account for them? 
Example: 
I visit an online store. They want x bitcoin for product. I sent x from my wallet. How does the transaction fee get in there or how do I put it in there?
Another example:
I have x bitcoin in an online wallet like localbitcoins. I want to send x to my phone or pc wallet. How do I deal with transaction fees in there?

Yes! Forgot to mention that. I browsed a lot of the apps and so far airbitz is my favorite. I also tried it after watching a few presentations from the CEO.

But how would I account for that or add it into a payment to some vendor? If a vendor expects a payment of $20 and I send them $21 dollars wouldn't they just keep that? How do I specify that a small amount goes to the fee?

If the company exists in the US it is compromised by default! Stop posting US companies!

Right now, localbitcoins and airbitz. I just haven't actually made a transaction yet. Trying to get a grasp on things before I move money around.

That's hilarious

They seriously need to update the UI on their Android app. It's fugly. That holo design goes back to ice cream sandwich (2011).

His legs look way too small for his torso. This pic just doesn't look right

Fuck iiiit

Nice try

So.... Who is doing it?
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:09:37
Yup definitely a reddit issue. Mass pm is extremely risky. I don't know if that should be allowed at all. And if it is allowed, the minimum should be a year old account or possibly more.

Oh no problem. I have my mri right here

This is actually a REALLY good lesson on how the media twists people's words to fit a particular narrative.
Take note people: this happens everywhere and ALL THE TIME.

I'd have to agree with you. Switching is definitely the best option for maximum privacy. Kind of similar to tumbling your coins

Hijacking real quick but I'm considering buying one but I saw that they are working on a version 2? Should I wait?
