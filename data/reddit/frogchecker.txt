unfortunately still some traders trying to play hot potato, immediate purchase of 10,000 shares when labcoin announced they would clear things up tomorrow. That's absolutely insane, I beleive this is the 5th time they have made that promise. There is only one reason why they would not clear it up right now when it is urgently needed, and it's pretty obvious as to why they wouldn't.

if you read this and rush to buy shares you are beyond help.
very similar sounding update was given in regards to bitscalper
   &gt;"What it is clear now, is that we did not run away with the money, we are coders, very well grounded in the financial field, and we're developing more and more infrastructure. The facts are all against your theory Matthew. Even if you use fancy words. I hope you seriously reconsider your position in a few weeks when you see that everything is working smoothly, also contact me if you want to see a part of our codebase."


This was final excuse given to shareholders previously (on bitscalper scam)
   &gt;"Ok, this is too much, i just noticed that someone stolen the few hundred coins i had transferred this morning to start the withdrawals. Probably someone who had gained earlier access and kept it silently, hoping for the better. I'm starting to check logs and whatever i need to find out where the coins are gone.. suggestions ? i am left with no words, sorry guys.."
till this day, coins have not been recovered and it goes down as yet another bitcoin scam
