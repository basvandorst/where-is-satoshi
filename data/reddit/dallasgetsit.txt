Kids these days and their Bitcoins and Britney Spears!

It's a great way to save a fraction of your income, in my view, because I think as more people adopt it for online transactions/donations, it will rise in value and ubiquity.  Of course, nothing is guaranteed, but I don't see the same inhibitions to adoption many of the Jeremiahs do.  Another obvious reason to use Bitcoin is the fact it allows you to send and receive money instantly from anywhere in the world - it's like a better PayPal.  That alone makes it an extremely valuable protocol.
@_date: 2012-10-24 16:14:25
Eh... In a sense he's correct.  Money is a tool, a means to an end.  When money is very-trustworthy (like Bitcoin), its value is an expression of respect for others and yourself.  That's a kind of self-love, or egoism along the same lines as what Nathaniel Branden talks about in his books.

I wonder how this compares to gold, in terms of new ounces mined each year vs how much already exists above ground.
@_date: 2012-09-24 21:21:04
I heard gangs in Mexico cut off people's heads for USD.  Nasty stuff, not sure I'd want anything to do with that currency.
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:09:55
It's data that's useless for anything other than communicating value.  So unlike gold, which requires a lot of labor to dig up, or federal reserve notes, which are backed by demand for bonds (which are themselves backed by the labor of American taxpayers), you can't make a regressive case for bitcoin's value.  Although you sometimes see people try by linking the value of Bitcoin to electricity needed to mine them.

The client could be updated to verify the special block against the prior blocks, so there'd be a seamless transition.  I'm not a programmer but I don't see why this couldn't work in theory.
@_date: 2012-12-14 17:40:33
Not at all, we were one new to Bitcoin, too.  We didn't invent it.  Bu we researched it, understood the economics behind it, understood the CS behind it, and understood the powerful political implications.  We weren't dismissive, and we certainly weren't angry at the advocates of Bitcoin.  Throwaway-o is just referring to the naysayers and partisans who spread misinformation and negativity because they feel threatened by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-15 23:57:42
We shouldn't gloat when this happens, though, because remember the goal here:  to make the best goddamn money the world has ever known.  If a lot of honest people are losing their savings, it doesn't help the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2012-12-31 21:06:52
I'm not sure that's a redefinition, but whatever.
@_date: 2012-12-14 18:33:54
But Bitcoin is just 0s and 1s.  How could we get rich from that?  /s
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:11:43
Careful, taxation is justified in the same way!  "it's just 1%!" and then it grows...
@_date: 2012-11-15 23:51:41
Yep, but the inflation is already baked into bitcoin's value.  So even with the increase in supply, the value of BTC will likely keep increasing from here, making it a deflationary currency.  Odd how that works!
@_date: 2012-10-08 20:16:31
You could still have trust about the contents of each account without 100% of their transaction histories, right?
@_date: 2012-12-24 14:56:16
What?  All those people using dollars and euros will benefit from central planning!  Haven't you read a macroeconomics textbook??  /s
@_date: 2012-12-14 17:41:53
Haha, awesome.
@_date: 2012-12-31 21:00:18
All means of savings are wildly speculative.
@_date: 2012-11-17 19:24:00
Have you read Menger's work on the origin of money?  Entrepreneurial vision isn't what causes something to become a money.  Bitcoin protocol has qualities that make it an ideal candidate to be money - electricity usage isn't one of those qualities.  It's like saying gasoline is what gives cars value.  Cars would still be valuable as a means of transport if they used water or Thorium as fuel. 
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:23:43
Right, but if that could be achieved without electricity, Bitcoin would still be valuable.  It's the protocol that's valuable, which is only information.
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:38:54
If the protocol could verify all transactions such that double spending of coins is impossible *without electricity*, Bitcoin would be just as valuable as a means to measure value.
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:36:36
Now we're getting somewhere!  :)
Can you be any more specific?
@_date: 2012-10-08 20:17:14
Thanks, this is what I was looking for.  Any links/details related to this?
@_date: 2012-10-08 20:13:02
No, you could trust the network to verify it.  Once something like 80% of nodes have verified, the unnecessary data could be deleted.
@_date: 2012-10-08 20:15:07
Right, but doesn't electrum still rely on others having the full block chain?  I'm talking about making it so the entire network doesn't need the whole history.
@_date: 2012-09-28 01:25:36
Yeah, no sympathy.  High levels of interest + anonymity means shady.
@_date: 2012-11-03 13:57:29
Zerohedge is a huge audience of Wall Street insiders and guys who manage billions in money.  It's like their Drudge Report.  So it's a great big billboard exposing all those power players to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-03 13:59:44
Yeah, that's what they tell people like you.  But they secretly refresh the site a dozen times a day while at work, and discuss it with their colleagues.
@_date: 2012-11-17 19:36:41
I've never heard of a tool "being useful to fulfill an entrepreneurial vision" before.  But whatever floats your boat.

This is a glaring example of a someone who's fallen for two common fallacies:  the labor theory of value and the idea that value resides in physical space.  Bitcoin's existence is a dagger in the heart to both of these outmoded beliefs.
@_date: 2012-11-17 20:19:31
I've read so much about Austrian economics it would blow your mind.
"Entrepreneurial vision" is not a thing.  It's a phrase.  Bitcoin is valuable because it has all the qualities of a good money.  Not because of a "vision".
The "vision" you're referring to is an effect of the fact Bitcoin has the other qualities of a good money - it's highly-divisible, tough to steal, never degrades over time, instantly transferable over long distances, avoids government intrusions, private, etc.  (You may be able to think of more)
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:18:43
It takes a hell of a lot of labor to polish a turd - doesn't make it valuable.  Bitcoin's value comes from its ability to accurately communicate value while bypassing government intrusions.  The electricity is a sunk cost - Bitcoin would be valuable even if it required no electricity.  Heck, it'd be even more valuable!
@_date: 2012-10-24 16:18:05
Money is just a "get out of jail" card according to statists.
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:34:27
Also you'll note that my argument wasn't that Bitcoin is valuable regardless of how scarce it is.  My argument was that electricity has nothing to do with its value.
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:32:46
Then explain this:  why doesn't the price of Bitcoin (as measured in dollars, for instance) align perfectly with the price of electricity?

"Sending money is now as easy as sending a text message."
Compare it to another familiar protocol.

I actually thought it was really easy with Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:40:44
Even if they were successful in shutting it down, it would confirm the "Bitcoin thesis", and thus the incentive to start a new digital crypto-currency that's not as susceptible to attack would be magnificently high.  Maybe the new currency would somehow start off where the old Bitcoin blockchain ended.
@_date: 2013-01-06 19:30:42
Depends on the services that spring up to help people get started.  Almost every small town has a few teenage geeks who can go around explaining things to their elders.  Think of it as the Bitcoin "geek squad".

Tipping people on would be a delight.  Especially people who are making the case for the Austrian view.  Imagine all the butthurt liberals watching real money fly right under their noses.
@_date: 2013-01-19 15:12:33
It reminds me of The Poptart Tragedy.
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:20:06
Sucks seeing everyone else making money, eh?
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:42:47
...and then that causes inflation to rise, which lurches interest rates higher, which forces even more govt spending cuts.
@_date: 2013-01-29 18:07:15
Hmm yes that does sound underhanded.  They ought to have some sort of hedge on the Bitcoin price rising.  And I don't understand why they take so long to deliver.
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:25:56
There's definitely a distinction between someone who doesn't get why Bitcoin is a big deal, and someone who actively blasts it without offering substantive solutions/alternatives.

It's bizarre.  Of all people you'd expect to "get it", you'd think they'd be the first.

Heh.  And dollars can be inflated while Bitcoins can't.  That makes for a deadly combo in favor of BTC.

The question is:  will the stock market correct before the dollar depreciates rapidly?  Corporations are holding on to a lot of cash, maybe in anticipation of a correction.

Somebody sounds butthurt.

There will be a correction this time, not a crash.  I think the floor might be around 18.
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:49:41
Excellent post, glad to see acknowledgment that the market will be greatly incentivized to come up with solutions as the transaction fees rise.
@_date: 2013-02-16 16:50:57
Keep sitting on the sidelines, bro.  ;)
@_date: 2013-01-29 16:33:24
Maybe it would be a good idea to pre-empt media efforts to describe Bitcoin.  We need to be proactive by having a standard Bitcoin "explanatory paper" that's well-translated into many languages.  Email the link to newspapers whenever something big related to Bitcoin happens.
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:10:25
The hoarders will disgorge as the price FALLS, not rises.  Bitcoin is currently a Giffen good.  But as it becomes more widely adopted, these boom/bust cycles will become fewer and less frequent.  And yes, over the long term Bitcoin will be worth trillions.  But it will be a scary and bumpy ride up.
