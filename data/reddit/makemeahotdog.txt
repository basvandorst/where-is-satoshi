Indeed. They can't wait to sell their oh so precious coins for worthless statist slave fiat. It's the endgoal for every bagholder here. Dirty fiat dollars. Lots of em.

Bitcoin is absolutely unusable to the average person. In every aspect. Buying them, using them, storing them, security. 
On top of that it could crash overnight and lose 50% of its value. 
Older people and children won't be able to use it. And let's not forget the transaction limit. A few big supermarkets is enough to fill up the transaction limit. 
Bitcoin is one of the worst currencies for these people to move to. 
Everybody out there in the real world understands this. Just this sub seems to live in an alternate reality. 
Edit: go ahead with the downvotes but man up and at least tell me where i'm wrong.

Nobody here gives a shit about Greece. Actually most here are crying tears of joy that the country is going to shit because they think it will make their coins worth more. Which won't happen in the first place. Apart from a little pump and dump. 
Nobody in Greece even considers buying bitcoins. They prefer not to lose their money again. 
Now i will get downvoted because basically i'm saying that the "hodlers" won't get rich because of Greece. And they won't accept that.

Nobody knows.

What lifeline? Nobody there gives a shit about Bitcoin. Do you realize this? Outside this sub it's non-existant. Not 1 Greek is thinking hey maybe i should put my money in Bitcoin instead. And rightly so. It's one of the worst things they could do. 
Anyway, it's like saying beanie babies are a lifeline to the Greeks. Or anything else really. Because it isn't. It simply isn't. As soon as you get out of this sub it's non-existant.

No. Of course not.

Financially sound? How can you completely ignore Bitcoin could crash 50% in a day. Pretty much ANY currency out there is a safer option than Bitcoin. Do you really not see this? Bitcoin lost 70% of it's value in the last year and a half and you suggest people should buy Bitcoin if they don't want to lose money. 
How can you people just be so delusional. This shit is truly amazing to read.

Excited that a country is going to shit.
