Pardon my ignorance. But could you explain like I'm 5 how does you testing a solution on one bar for 1 night means that solution scales for the whole planet on the long term.

How do you know that? You can't say that without knowing exactly who to whom and for what that transaction was made. It could have went from or to a centralized exchange.

This is good for Bitcoin (tm).
You don't overthink it. You just accept it.
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:50:26
Pardon my ignorance. But doesn't that defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin very existence in the first place? Isn't the whole philosophy behind all of this to cut the middle man and give us freedom?
Why exactly would anyone ever buy anything from an arbitrary brick and mortar store with Bitcoin? You can't use the "I don't trust the banks!" card here because you are trusting banks anyway. You are just picking which banks to trust at this point.
I really hope Bitcoin succeeds. But until we find a technological solution that is fast, simple and reliable enough to let stores use it directly without a middle man. Than I see no use for Bitcoin other than the current price speculation as a get rich quick scheme. Which is why most people are really into it.

Coincidentally you only "got curious" when you saw the price mooning at ATH.
That's not being "curious". That's being greedy for an easy make-money-quick scheme.

I'm a startup junkie. Been to many meet ups of local tech startups and investors. A couple years ago almost every new start up had "blockchain" somewhere in their pitch. Nowadays if VCs hear the word "blockchain" you can literally see their eyes roll. The blockchain bubble already burst long ago.
The "bitcoin sucks but blockchain will change mankind" meme is only parroted by people who have no slight clue of what blockchain really is, what problem it solves, and which ones it doesn't.

So does every centralized crypto exchange. ¬¬ Yet those are how 99%+ of people use Bitcoin. It's the de facto way BTC is used on practice. Going against the core idea behind what Bitcoin was created in the first place is how BTC is actually being used by virtually everyone who believes they're part of some "bitcoin revolution".
This isn't any worse...

Last time I suggested Bitcoin could work fine without PoW, I was called a communist, vegan, literal tree hugger. Which I'm none of... 
This sub isn't about the technology and potential of crypto currency for our freedom. It's about Bitcoin and lambos.
To answer the original question: yes, Bitcoin could work fine without the need for mining. Instead of making BS ridiculous excuses ignoring scale for the energy spent with mining, like the article cited. We could have just been using Bitcoin without that problem if the community really wanted.

Believing crypto has value and believing it will take over are 2 separate things that are not necessarily together.
You might believe crypto has value, but there are barriers outside of the technology that could hold it back. For example, by far and large most people who buy Bitcoin use a centralized exchange. That completely defeats the purpose of crypto. It completely defeats your argument of the value of crypto being that you don't need a third party. You might argue that you think all these people using centralized exchanges are wrong and stupid. But, humans are humans. And that's what they chose to do. Crypto might never take off because of that: the potential is there, but people just don't wanna use it.
And as for your point B. You are missing the possibility that maybe Bitcoin has some inherit drawback in how it's built that would require a radical change that could break trust to fix (ie. a hard fork). Regardless whether one specific change is good or not. There are reasons beyond the technology that could mean the change wouldn't work. Maybe it's not popular because, again, humans being humans.

Since PoW is not the only solution to the problem it solves, and certainly not the best or most efficient solution. Then by definition PoW is that wasteful.
The only reasonable argument you can use to counter is that it's not an intrinsic Bitcoin problem. It's a PoW problem. Bitcoin could solve this by switching away from PoW to one of the many other solutions like ETH did.
But until Bitcoin does that, then yeah, it's a huge waste for the environment. Just because you support something you don't have to pretend that something is perfect and can't improve.

Guys it's all part of his plan..
McAfee dumps Bitcoin price down.
Bitcoin is worth less than one cent of a dollar by the end of 2019.
McAfee buys literally all Bitcoin and mines all remaining.
McAfee puts his Bitcoin for sale for one million dollar each.
Even if no one is willing to buy it then. Technically it's still correct to say his prediction was right. No dicks were eaten.

That's the kind of useful things we should care about instead of worrying about day to day price.

@_date: 2018-12-29 15:49:22
What you are misunderstanding is that as long as new coins are being found, supply is increasing, not staying the same. The rate of new coins being found reducing means the supply is increasing at a slower pace. It does not mean supply is reducing. Supply for Bitcoin has always increased and will keep increasing until all coins are found.
Until that happens, for the price of Bitcoin to be stable. Demand would always need to grow to match the ever growing supply.

@_date: 2018-12-29 15:24:20


Technically, you mean if the growth in demand stays the same. If demand does stay the same, while new coins are still being made, then naturally, the price goes down. Even if the rate of new coins is lower. Price has only gone up, ever, because demand has increased faster than new coins are found.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:02:25
But.. almost everyone who buys Bitcoin uses a centralized exchange.. which means, most users don't really believe in the technology.
So, if its value is the belief of users... Then it has very little to no value.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:01:00


That literally couldn't be further from the truth. And *definitely* not what Warren meant...
"most successful wealthy people" didn't make their wealth speculating in, as Warren himself puts it: "an asset that doesn't produce anything". Warren included.
If you're going to follow Warren Buffett's advice, then you should not invest in Bitcoin. As he has made himself very clear what's his opinion on the matter.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:05:53
"But centralized exchange is not bad, once you don't use one anymore."
...Do you really want me to explain the obvious?
Banks are also not all bad. I mean, you can just take your money out of the bank. Man, why did we even start this Bitcoin thing in the first place? Banks are actually not a problem at all....
