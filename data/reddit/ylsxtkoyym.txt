OP, listen to this guy. There's nothing wrong with playing with Bitcoin with a bit of side money, but betting your entire future on a single asset (Bitcoin or not) is a dangerous idea. Unless you enjoy wild mood swings dictated by whatever a single number is on any given day, you need to diversify and take it slow. Retirement saving is definitely one of those things where slow and steady wins the race.

In reality though securing that private key is incredibly difficult. The cryptography is sound, but the fact that cryptocurrency operates in an open networked system makes it *very* vulnerable to side channel attacks. Read any [industry standard security engineering text]( and you'll see that cryptography is just a relatively small component in establishing identity, ownership, and integrity. You can't claim to have a trustless system when anywhere along that chain -- whether on your computer, your ISP, or your local regulrations -- you're using something without full knowledge of its implementation.

This is just post-hoc rationalization from people who want things now for free.

Honestly, I do want to be proven wrong, because that would mean someone came up with some really clever new technology that makes the world that much better.

If a serious enough disaster warranted that, I doubt they'd have the means to collect and convert the Bitcoins into something useful.


Free peer-to-peer electronic transfers are pretty common these days. Sure, there's a 2 day clearing period for cross-bank transactions, but there aren't too many circumstances where a buddy needs his $5 *right naow*. In the UK, though, these things are instant.

Not completely, but you can mitigate the problem by preventing the voter from bringing back proof of how he voted (i.e., polling places) and devising [clever ways]( for the voter to ensure his vote was properly counted without letting him reveal his vote.

Any sort of online voting scheme carries huge risks for tampering, coercion, vote-buying, denial-of-service, and non-auditability. You don't have to just secure the votes. You have to secure the voter.

Being tamper-evident can be a serious vulnerability in and of itself. An adversary can throw any election in question by merely triggering those tamper indicators.
Internet elections are an incredibly risky endeavor, regardless of what technology you use to implement it. Ultimately, you're not gaining a lot (compared to existing in-person voting systems) for all the cost and hassle it takes to do it correctly.

I'm really confused. If you're somewhere where cell phone signal is spotty, it's highly unlikely there are a lot of WiFi networks to buy access from. If you're somewhere where there are a lot of WiFi networks available, you're probably somewhere with a lot of people; enough for a phone company to justify building a cell tower to service that region.
You need to think about the system you're proposing in the context in which it's going to operate.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:00:22
It's really not a hard concept. The blockchain is just a distributed ledger (or timeline or historical database) with certain integrity guarantees, 51% attacks notwithstanding. It still needs to find a compelling problem to solve though.

Bitcoin is cryptographically sound but is really susceptible to a large number of side-channel attacks with next to no chance of mitigation after the fact. From a security engineering perspective, this makes it insecure.
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:31:30


From a technical standpoint, make new payment methods just as easy to use (and use securely) as credit cards. This means ease of use up front, ease in preventing attacks as a matter of course, and ease in mitigating the effects of attacks. In my opinion, Bitcoin does none of that. It requires too much work on the user's part to use it properly. From a social standpoint, it doesn't help that Bitcoin is associated with fringe political views, scams, and illicit markets. Even if Bitcoin's usability and security problems were solved, most people still aren't going to use it unless it's perceived to be better than what they already have.

I don't understand your explanation. You can make software open source, but how can you get qualified people take the time to review and fix it, especially for niche custom software running driving specialized IoT devices? Even the Heartbleed bug was in the wild for over two years, and that's in a library that practically everyone uses.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:10:52
It has physical protections; it's only vulnerable to those who can physically get to it. I don't have to defend my cash wallet against Chinese hackers. I didn't have to do anything extra to get this benefit.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:08:54
I'm not so sure about the economics of that. Places that aren't covered by terrestrial ISPs and cell phone companies tend to be very low density areas, like [here]( (I know because I've been there and there's practically no cell signal to be found anywhere in Arizona north of Flagstaff) How can they ever hope to recoup the cost of deploying WiFi there when 1) people are already very price sensitive to WiFi access considering free is the norm and 2) traffic density there is so low? The only possibilities I see are set prices low enough that people are willing to pay for it, but you probably won't break even for decades, or set prices really high and hope enough fat cats go through that area willing to pay thousands of dollars for access.
Where do you propose your system would work best?

Everything is on a rising trend if your baseline is inception and you're anywhere before death. It's meaningless.
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:39:51
Because you're ignoring the whole system, which you shouldn't when you're evaluating how secure something is.


The default course of action with fiat is quite secure. The default with Bitcoin is questionable at best. Bitcoin can be more secure under ideal circumstances, but those ideal situations are rarely attainable in practice (i.e., too hard to carry out or too easy to ignore). Bitcoin can be as secure as cash *only if you go out of your way to make it so*. That's not something you can assume that happens because it's not the default.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:54:29
How much cheaper though? [This]( is the current competition, and users don't need to worry about renegotiating with multiple WiFi routers when they're on the move.

Put yourself in their shoes. Think about what you would do if someone tipped you Litecoin or Dogecoin.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:30:05
Then I hope for all of us you don't touch security engineering with a 10-foot pole. Writing off defaults and human behavior is recipe for disaster. A system that, by default, pushes users to behaving in suboptimal ways is an insecure system.
If you actually do want to learn instead of talking out of your ass, here's an excellent industry-standard textbook on the topic

I'm a critic of the techno-utopian outlooks surrounding the blockchain, and this is is exactly why. The blockchain is a really interesting technology, but you sound like a loon if you go around trying to graft it onto everything without explaining what problem it is you're trying to solve in doing so. What benefits do you get out of these blockchain-driven locks, for instance? I'm not seeing anything that justifies the cost of having increased complexity and a significantly larger attack surface (i.e., an Internet-connected lock has to defend against the whole world, while a simple mechanical lock only has to defend against anyone who can physically get near it).
Identify the parameters of the problem you're trying to solve, then pick the best tools to address it. Don't go around with a hammer thinking everything's a nail.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:08:19
Bitcoin, in the typical case, has all the irreversibility of cash with all the attack surface of fiat, with none of the protections. That's why you have to consider fiat, of which cash is a component. You have to consider the whole system for a fair comparison.
Bitcoin's defaults, as they are right now, really suck from a security standpoint. Fix those defaults and it'll be more secure.

But you're not giving non-enthusiasts a reason why they want Bitcoins in the first place. Unless you want to buy illicit goods online or pay off Cryptolocker crooks, anything you can buy with Bitcoin you can also buy using dollars.
Additionally, with the majority of American cell phone owners having smartphones and the requisite data plans, mobile connectivity is already a mature and saturated market. Why would people share their WiFi? And why would people want to get access through those? Is there a use case in the context of a developing country someone can elaborate on?

You seem to be under the impression that large organizations are wasteful, and in some senses (like the amount of work each individual worker does for the wage they get), they really are. However, those same large organizations can use their heft to acquire things at much lower price than individuals or small groups can ever hope to. It's the magic of economies of scale.

It's not "frictionless" when credit cards are mainstream, Bitcoin is fringe, and you're asking end-users to use the latter option. "Removing the burden of credit card processing" is not a priority for the people you're ultimately trying to get to pay for this service.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:10:52
It's pretty safe to hold cash on the street because you're only vulnerable to those near you. This is why I said there's a big difference in attack surface between cash and Bitcoin. Security is a systems-wide property. You have to take everything into account.
Edit: And our current employment and financial system does nudge people to keeping their money in vaults through convenient direct deposits and reversible electronic transactions. It's easier to be secure with fiat as a matter of course than with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:57:19
I'm comparing defaults to defaults. I don't know what strange mental gymnastics you have going on there.
Cash: In your hand, vulnerable to those physically near you.
Fiat in general (for the majority of people who get their pay in checks or direct deposit): In your bank account, vulnerable to the entire world, but generally strictly regulated and insured
Bitcoin: Online, vulnerable to the entire world or bad actors, regulatory grey area, irreversible
You can make Bitcoin more secure, but by default (i.e., how you acquire it and use it), it really isn't. The typical case for Bitcoin sucks compared to cash or electronic fiat. The best case for Bitcoin (which requires user initiative and intervention which you can't reasonably assume), *that's* comparable to fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:36:43
What exactly is your primary goal here? To build a bandwidth-sharing system? Or to use Bitcoin? I'm asking because those two can exist entirely independent of each other, but you seem to be shoehorning the latter into the former for no good reason.

Your firing is pretty funny. That you won't stop coming up with shit ideas further fuels this comedy train. Are you an actual engineer? Or just an "ideas man?"

@_date: 2015-02-22 20:39:22
But again, you're not required (or even pushed) to do this. In fact, the path of least resistance in using Bitcoin is to have a 3rd party online wallet to manage your keys for you. You have to go out of your way to securely maintain your private key yourself.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:28:35
That's a pretty tough assumption to make. You can't conclude Bitcoin is secure just because the cryptography is strong. Cryptography is just one component in designing secure systems. If crypto were all that mattered, then we'd all be using one-time pads for our secure communications.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:22:40


Which is the default action for *an electronic currency*, so we can reasonably assume that most people do this. You have to go out of your way to get the benefit you mention. I stand by what I said earlier: you can make Bitcoin as secure as cash, but you can't assume that this is the norm because it's too easy to ignore that measure.
Cash, by default, is more secure than Bitcoin. Electronic fiat, by default, is more secure than Bitcoin. Fixing Bitcoin's defaults to compel or nudge users to using paper wallets as a matter of course will improve its security.

I guess what I'm driving at here is what's the point of the blockchain in all this? As it stands right now, blockchain consensus is based on trapdoor functions: hard to compute, but easy to verify. I'm not seeing how this technology can play a part in producing outcomes like getting people interested in fixing bugs in critical but super niche software in the first place. You seem to be proposing a highly technical solution to a highly social problem. Can you reconcile that for me? Am I misunderstanding something?

I think in the typical case (where you don't have well-funded persistent threats focusing on you specifically), Bitcoins are less secure than cash by virtue of the fact that Bitcoin lives online, and therefore exposes a larger attack surface. With cash, in the typical case, you only have to defend against threats that are physically nearby.
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:37:00


Yeah, and it's been reasonably cheap to do so since machine tools have been around. I don't understand why someone would add layers of complexity to a system without getting an obvious benefit out of it. That all these blockchain visionaries don't ever talk about trade-offs suggests to me that they're either incompetent or malicious.

If that's the case, they'll do what OPEC is trying to do right now: use their market position to drop prices and drive the competition away. These people aren't idiots. Again, large organizations have the benefit of economies of scale. You can't compete with them directly because they have the capital to withstand what you throw at them. That, and they're already past the point of building out their network, where most of the costs are.

@_date: 2015-02-22 20:00:58
None of those are required to use Bitcoin. They're merely best practices and recommendations, which users are more likely to ignore than act on. [Usability is a key security feature](
It's the same reason why passwords are quite insecure even though we have password generators and managers and 2FA available: it's easier to ignore those recommendations without affecting your use than it is to adopt them. Build a system that compels or nudges users to those best practices and you have a secure system (well, until adversaries adapt to the new measures).
