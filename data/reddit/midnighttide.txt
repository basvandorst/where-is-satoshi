Seriously, naive?  The big banks walk because they own the politicians.  
I don't care about the "if we didn't bail them out everything would have collapsed" line of rhetoric either.  So what, they got bailed out - this time.  The big five banks in the US hold hundreds of trillions in derivatives, the Chinese are cooking the books to give impressive GDP numbers every year.  The entire damn system is corrupt.
Let the damn thing fall apart already, it is only QE holding things together anyway.

This is a horrible attitude to have, because it defeats the purpose of bitcoin in becoming mainstream.  That is, making even more profit.
bitcoin holders should instead of being smug about being on the train should want others to have a chance in getting a ticket.

Well to be honest, likely all business convert to fiat.  Crypto has a long way to go before it can seriously compete with fiat, still lots of work to be done.
(and why would they hold it, it is still a speculators market)
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:16
I can understand where you are coming from, especially from those who had hundreds / thousands of bitcoins stolen.
I would want to kill the motherfuckers if it happened to me.

Yes, at some point the governments around the globe are going to attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies, I just fear that it will no longer be decentralized.
I know the banks are itching to get their hands involved.

I have a few buttons....but I won't be buying any more of them.  Try to have conversations on here is almost impossible if you don't go with the group think.  I have tried to tell people that a majority of b itcoins are being hoarded and even with all these merchants.....people don't really use b itcoins to purchase from them.  Tiger Direct, Overclock....numbers of bitcoins purchase have gone way down.  Sorry for spelling, typing on smart phones is new to me.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:35:53
sad that people will simply ignore the truth
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:23:46
Well lets see how long people will actually spend their bitcoins on Expedia or will we see a large drop like overstock (over time)
A step in the right direction anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:01:35
Because you have a limit (21 million coins), you have a lot of coins being lost every year.  People also are simply holding onto bitcoins as an investment, not a currency (upwards of 50%)
Sadly all I am seeing from a lot of the crypto community is greed when the promise was Bitcoin / alt coins was the answer to decentralizing the market and eliminate the central banks.  (especially from the early adapters of crypto)
and no I am not bashing bitcoin, I believe it is more of a investment coin while Doge could become a spending coin - both can have their place in the market.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:33:43
If everyone is so worried about it, simple solution.  Miners start leaving and the hash rate goes down.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:18:24
Talking about an image problem.  Talk like that does nothing for the reputation of cryptocurrency, regardless of what coin you hold.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:44:26
The figures do not lie, the issue is already a problem.
I guess you could say that bitcoin is like a savings account, while Doge could be a checking account.  Converting currencies online is becoming quick and easy and with the easy going / easy to learn nature of Dogecoin perhaps people will want to spend Doge and invest Bitcoin. 
I am not aware of Freicoin so I can't speak of it.
Also, many people say you can not regulate crypto, I would tend to disagree - if you want to buy something from a merchant the government will have a say as to how the transaction will take place.  Not to mention all of this can become mute if the global fiat economy doesn't blow up in all our faces.
edit: As to spending, people really are not spending Bitcoin, people are saving it because many think it will only increase in value, that is why I believe it is an investment and not a spending currency.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:15:00
Same could be said of any cryptocurrency.

He might have run off with all the mintpal funds, millions of dollars.
I don't think anyone involved will be forgiving him.  I am still surprised that the Mt Gox dude hasn't ended up at the bottom of a harbor yet.  (and same goes for Moolah if he has stolen the funds)

I wouldn't go down any dark alleys Mark....you don't have the protection like the central banks / corporate CEOs have.  Well that is if you didn't make any deals with the elite in trying to deep six the crypto world.

I still don't understand how some of you think a global economic collapse is good for bitcoin.  Hey, there is nothing to eat but damn, I got some bitcoin in my wallet on my computer.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:21:45
Perhaps, but what do you think will happen to many bitcoin holders (who bought in during one of the highs) will think when their coins are worthless by that attack.
The battle will be waged in the reputation of the idea.  Which at this point is rather fragile with the Mt Gox....and people still talk about the Silk Road.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:46:47
I would rather have food, water and ammo.
edit:  Spelling, damn smart phones
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:42:34
and what does bitcoin offer then "being the first?"
Nothing really....and you have a marketing nightmare not to mention an-cap nut bars whose very nature will make mom and pop public run away from cryptos.
I thought you guys were turning a corner when you introduced bits, started tipping more and saw some actual discussion on how to help others......but I see that was just a passing fad.  
(I gather all this negativity towards Doge is that many of you bought near the high and are desperate to squash anything that may be considered competition.....and those early adapters who hold most of the coins)

Thing is though the time between them pulling this sort of thing is closing rapidly.  June, then December and now.
It has the appearance that they are losing control....and if the central bank just prints this problem away (we are talking trillions of dollars) then it will be interesting to see if they can hide the inflation.

@_date: 2014-02-26 00:16:22
It is just something the crypto community is going to have to ride out, there are articles all over the place saying how bad crypto currency is.
Was only to be expected since governments / large corporations hate the ideals of crypto (and who owns all the mass media)
The only thing I am worried about is how long will it take for the damage to fade away....
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:53:57
True or not (I believe it is true) but it all depends on the people you are talking to.  The general public doesn't see the banks as being criminal, all you are doing is portraying cryptos as conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:20:29
Don't turn this into a pissing match between coins.
A lot of crypto communities are willing to help, and if that means if turning Doge into bitcoin then so be it.

It is that kind of shit that reduces confidence in crypto, every community.  Oh look at that, some kids can get together and destroy the value of a currency.  Also, what OP is suggesting is simply creating a bubble.  
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:11:40
Oh I understand the why, but still doesn't answer the question that bitcoin, or any other crypto will solve those problems.
and "Bitcoin - the future" is not a viable answer.  I also see a lot of greedy assholes in the crypto community, not exactly what I imagine in a group trying to destroy the power elite.
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:45:59
Because we are actually working towards building public interest in cryptocurrency, to nullify the venom of the Silk Road / Mt Gox and branching out from the anarcho capitalists and extreme libertarians.

@_date: 2014-04-13 17:08:43
Well isn't it one of the ideals of crypto to decentralize the central banks - so if Bitcoin becomes a real threat, you don't think the bankers wouldn't spend billions to eliminate that threat?
The idea of a 51% attack on bitcoin wouldn't be to make a profit - it would be to destroy the coin.

LAV = light armored vech.  We are selling them to Saudi Arabia.
People have been predicting the housing bubble burst for years now.  It won't burst until the QE bubble / low interest rate is unsustainable, in which point the global economy will be a mess.
I have bitcoins, don't believe it will mean anything if we have a massive economic crash.
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:57:38

You are more then welcome to hold your bitcoins but if you want it to thrive you should encourage people to actually use it.  The more people that use it the higher the price will go up.

You can only prop / fake the numbers for so long.  The more you use lower interest rates / QE to stimulate the less effective it becomes.  The number of companies in China today that require government bailouts is staggering.  China has between $25 and $30 trillion notional in financial and non-financial corporate credit.
They will only be able to kick the can for so long before it all comes crashing down.
Now will Chinese flock to bitcoin?  Who knows.

I still think people are idiots for thinking that a collapse of the Euro would be a good thing for bitcoin.  Hey the global economy is shit but I should buy some computer money.

Yes I am well aware of the Cyprus option but if it goes to the extent of the entire EU going that route it means the entire system is collapsing.  Meaning the currency is crap, rapid inflation and everything is expensive as hell.  So you have bitcoins, do you think the grocery store cares about that?
It is all well and good to perhaps have your wealth protected but you aren't going to eat it.  Our current society is nothing like it was during the last depression, I shudder to think what chaos is going to develop when suddenly everything you have is worthless.
Not to mention that bitcoin is barely on the public's consciousnesses other then scam / hack / dope.  I have bitcoins but I do not think or hope that an economic collapse will be good for holders of bitcoin.  Everyone better pray to whatever god they believe in that nothing like that occurs cause that shit won't be pretty.

shhhh....they don't realize they are letting the snake into the garden.
and no I don't have any specific idea of what they may do, but the reason that bitcoin is valuable to many people is a decentralization from the government, allowing GS flunkies into the mix, they are going to try and regulate it where they hold all the cards, exactly as they do now (and screw many bitcoin holders now)
call me a tin foil hat member but just wait and see.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:35:55
I just finished buying some bitcoins from a local but the one question I have from all of this is unless this volatility stabilizes won't most merchants stop accepting bitcoins?  One day your on the top the next you just lost half of your money.  
Now don't shoot the messenger, just a thought.
(Yes, I know it has the potential to sing back up just as fast, but I know some merchants don't want to take that kind of risk......and this will be a problem for bitcoin to become more accepted)
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:02:54
Well come on guys, the entire point of bitcoin is decentralizing those big banks.
Of course they won't have anything to do with bitcoin.  If they can't have complete control of something, they are going to try to destroy it, make it as hard as hell if you want to do business with it.
If you are going to go the bitcoin route just realize you are an enemy of the banks / governments that want to maintain complete control of the economy.
