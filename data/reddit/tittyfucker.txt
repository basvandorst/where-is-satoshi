500k is the paper balance including interest, it's likely a big number of those coins never existed and do not exist.

Say you get paid in coins that are being watched. 
Then you go to coinabul, forums, spendbitcoins, bitcoin-otc, ect (avoid exchanges)
Use unique, one time deposit address to pay. Now the coins have changed hands and no one has any way to know this except for the seller, who has no idea the coins are being watched. No one can inform him he just accepted "illegal" funds either as it's not possible to find out who owns the address. From this point on any following of the coins is useless for purpose of finding the original owner. 
That's the most simple way and leaves you open to risk if the person you were buying from was somehow compromised. If the seller had a system that did the same exact thing (coins go unique address &gt; big wallet &gt; known mtgox acc for coinabul for example) then it's possible to find out who the seller is then petition him of who customer was from some address. But there's lots more you can do before you trade that make it really hard to track and most importantly, even if they did find you somehow they could never prove "beyond reasonable doubt" in a court. After the coins have went from one address to another it's always a possibility they changed hands and now an innocent is in control of them.
There's also things like buying mining stocks or hashing power to create new coins with no trail. Deposit money into Silk Road, instawallet, or other services that combine deposits into one very large wallet, then withdrawal and get different coins.

Rates were 10%/week at first. He dropped interest for less than a week before he absconded. The other rate changes did nothing but funnel money into "trust" accounts that still paid 7%.


He had the ability to handle the liquidity himself and just paid insane interest because he was a nice guy, right?

I know but it's different. Not gaining something is totally different feeling than losing something to the mind. It's much easier to cope with. Morally it's the same though, I agree. I'm not trying to defend him, I was calling him a scammer a few days after the bet. He says he's going to the bitcoin conference so we'll see. I just don't think anything will happen, how far do you think you'd get after assaulting someone in London? I'd guess 1 maybe 2 blocks.

You can't crash the market to double up though. Once it's down you have to rebuy which drives the price back up. You would only get a very small amount of coins for "half price." There's pressure from panic sellers that would make it go down further so he could make a tiny profit but there is also people that bought low to sell higher.
@_date: 2012-07-13 17:37:48
No influence at all. These funds were already in limbo remember. They were in process of returing customers funds and that's what got stolen. So no one lost any liquid asset. Plus bitcoin economy is solid enough now that 360k USD isn't significant.

I don't even know what to say to this, if you really believe this you are very naive. 
Anyway, they could spend their 10mil and we could change the algo once we noticed what's going on. Then they spend another 10 mil and we change it again. Bitcoin is flexible and blockchain would just get forked, life goes on. Then we keep the never ending cat and mouse game going.

Being at the location is not necessary though. Unless you are trying to promote awareness. Everything else can be done online. You get a buyer. Just email them to met at a bank or airport.

If it was pirates address it's proof positive of a ponzi as those funds just sat there. But I don't think it's his personally. I'm more of the opinion he was selling a lot of the coins when there was unnatural stability @ 5 and there's not many coins left. Also explains the sudden shut down and why he is stalling rather than cutting ties right away.

Not really since they are all going off the assumption that it would be powered by the USB. The FPGA single plugs into USB but also has it's own power brick. It's silly to assume the ASIC won't be the same way.

Are you trying to suggest Visa/Master card/ Western Union have that much sway? The government could accept any currency for their drugs. If that currency is bitcoin it only makes things easier for them. You still haven't provided any incentive for them to do so, other than "think about it."

SR selling heroin is much more beneficial than weed though. People who use it are going to do it whether it's sold on SR or not. That you don't have to deal with the people who sell (or use) heroin face to face is a huge benefit. Also, if you don't have your entire social circle using then it's MUCH easier to quit. Weed dealers and users aren't nearly as dangerous.

No it's not. You're just assuming the kidnapper is an idiot and he has to sell the coins on an exchange. When exchanges start marking coins as tainted it will hurt bitcoin as a whole. Mtgox already tried this and it's total bullshit, doesn't work as intended anyway. I actually got my acc froze because I had "tainted" coins from bitcoinica hack, they released after I bitched about it on forums and everyone supported me. Anyway, bitcoin is very good currency for extortion, ransom, and the like. I could offer a lot of different ways you could spend the money without being traced. I've gotten into it somewhat in my posts in this forum already, but haven't gotten into extreme detail as there's no point helping people commit crimes. They can figure it out themselves anyway as it's not difficult.
@_date: 2012-08-12 15:12:22
Ok. I just got $20,000 USD worth of bitcoins. I just deposited them to Silk Road. Then I withdrawal random amounts eventually adding up to what I deposited. Now I have (at least partially) different coins through tor, for no fee. Whenever SR vendors and customers withdrawal they will get "tainted" coins. Now by denying to accept those coins you hurt bitcoin's fungibility. How do you find out who's the kidnapper and who are random users? You can't. There are many ways to do this, not just SR. If you combine different methods it's impossible to find out who the actual kidnapper was. If he did his job well he will never cash out a "tainted" coin. It's very simple to do this.

Well competiton is a good thing. But did you see how this guy (cablepair) reacted on bitcointalk.org when BFL made their announcement? He trolled their thread hard. Said their claims were impossible and would destory bitcoin. Made a thread like "BFL doesn't care about bitcoin" and went on and on and on in a totally unprofessional way. He made such a joke of himself I would never spend a dime on anything he offers. Not to mention like all his products, they will be released after BFLs for a higher cost and less performance.
@_date: 2012-08-07 15:09:22
The biggest issue right now is GPU mining may be obsolete in October. It's a bad time to invest heavily into any mining equipment right now because of the ASIC uncertainty. If the BFL ASIC are as advertised you'd be selling those GPU soon and you'd be very lucky to break even.

Patrick Strateman: CTO intersango. He is phantomcircuit on bitcointalk forums.
With a "speciality in security" He backed out of the bitcoinica stuff the same day it was announced their mtgox account was compromised. He is also the guy on the forums threatening people. Saying stuff like "if you start a lawsuit no one will ever see their money." "Without me no on would see their money." He was demanding respect and saying no one would get anything without him just a couple dsays before the compromise.
Donald Norman, CEO of intersango. Not sure if he post on forums. But if you read genjix posts; him and Patrick were the reasons for the big delays in payments. These two guys are the ones really to blame for the debacle. 
Then genjix. AFAIK he was their engineer, but didn't have much say in things. So he'd just do as told and now is taking most of the heat for Donald and Patricks decisions/failures.

Fiat will never die, I don't think even the most crazy bitcoin supporters think so. If the government can't print it's own money it would cease to exist.

So you say you disagree but then go on to support his point. You won't be buying bitcoins because you already have them, thus no "push". This service is also already available with any reloadable card that allows ACH funding (a lot of them do) and the fee is cheaper. The one thing this card offers that isn't already out there is a way for people to send money to other countries cheaper than western union. That depends on how it'll work in those countires ATM though.

The government invented Tor though, that's a pretty similar comparison to Bitcoin. Think of how easy the CIA could pay operatives in Iran if bitcoin really took off! They have uses for bitcoin as well. There's really no reason to kill it. Like I said, even if they did we'd just move to an altcoin.

But he'll only be able to do this for another month or two. Once ASIC comes out he'll be lucky to make 5 btc/month. Besides, the jail time if caught is pretty high, and $60,000 a year isn't really much. Better off to get a real job.
@_date: 2012-06-22 16:52:21
It was explained earlier in the thread why it wouldn't work like that. So those numbers are wrong. The company could not sell to the public and invest a lot into their own equipment. As soon as a competitor comes into the market their profitability goes into the toilet. So they stick with what they are good at, make the "money printers" and let the customers take the risk. Another thing to mention is they DO mine with these units, while they "test" them for customers. The more customers the more "testing" and they get to sell the unit as well.

Right but there's also upward push of people who are long getting in on cheaper coins and/or daytrading. So 10% &gt; 40% is not at all realistic. It'd be more like drop price by 10% and panic drops it another 2-6%. Bitcoin is getting more and more healthy and resistant to these things.

so tomorrow you will buy btc at minimum 0.2% fee, then likely spend those btc for groceries (as per your example) within two weeks (for ~1% fee bitinstant debit) , where do you live that you have 2.4% inflation per month? Or would you have been better off just keeping the USD and buying with that. That's the whole point, you wouldn't be buying more BTC than now (unless you're stupid, good possibility) That is the only scenario where you would boost (push) the btc economy because of this card. You also ignore the time from USD &gt; BTC but then factor in the time from BTC &gt; USD? Ok.
I have no bank account and can get bitcoins to a debit card in 3 confirms plus however long it takes to sell coins at market (can be instant if I want to sell at buy offers), always less than 3 hours. I'm not talking about sending to bank acc then using that debit card. Not going to hand hold either, though. If you don't already know how to do this you aren't as familiar with btc as you think you are.

ASIC will increase difficulty so much that it would be pointless to run the GPU even if it was free. Like a week for 0.1 BTC or less. So you have to sell them and hope you made enough BTC from now til ASIC come out and get enough in resale value to make your money back. You would never make back the investment by mining, the cards would die before that.
