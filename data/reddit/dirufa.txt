Guess you are talking to *that* guy.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:01:33
Can you provide a timestamp of these communications?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:28:18
That was pretty hard to handle, really.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:00:37
The difference is in enabling this kind of market.
More people get dogs from shelters, less people buy dogs from shops, less dogs will be bred, less dogs will be put in shelters = everyone is happy (except for people making a business out of it).
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:53:59
This is not . There's no proof v7.1 and lower of truecrypt were insecure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:17:11
So many lonely dogs in the world, and you buy a new one? Enjoy your new toy.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:47:48
So this is a new thing, to post puppies bought with cryptos on reddit
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:59:36
FYI, Barilla is the worst italian pasta you can buy. But I understand that's probably the only one you can find.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:44:23
I'll probably give it a try, thanks :)
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:18:57
Actually, there are infinite ʘ‿ʘ
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:16:10
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:19:39
To the moon, definitely
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:42:00
Pretty interesting, you should give it a try :P
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:42:33
I received this too, this morning.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:20:56
Why not 'us'?
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:14:50
Thanks man, I hope everything will be ok at the hotel :)
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:01:40
Guess italian bitcoiners wanting to withdraw some money will think twice into it.
Time for an italian exchange to appear.
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:15:26
Same here, only provided my full name and email, that's all.
I'm loving it!
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:27:37
I remembering solving 2 blocks in a day mining solo.
That's 100 btc, son
edit: With the CPU
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:42:50
Guess we'll just have to wait and see how this goes
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:45:51
Thank you, Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:56:02
That badass face :)
@_date: 2014-02-01 14:48:58
Unfortunately I dilapidated most of my Bitcoins in the past, but I like to think that I helped the project to grow. If only I had today half of the bitcoins I had in 2010... I would be a millionaire
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:14:58
Actually FTW!
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:15:47
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:56:40
I regret nothing :) Thx for your support
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:17:27
"...for 1 year!1"
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:26:27
You need you mind checked, not your eyes :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:10:50
That's what they want you to believe.
I have a close friend how has been working in the online betting industry for quite a few years now. In more than one occasion, talking about his work, he told me that the systems he works on actually log anything a player does.
As long as they are not completely newbies at this.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:34:12
Considering how much I lost in the mtgox affair, I'm lmao while keeping back the tears
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:51:17
Who would do such an invasive change in its infrastructure, invalidating previously used customer's addresses, without giving a decent warning a few weeks before?
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:47:33
I'm in europe, and I've had the Xapo Visa debit card for the past 2 months or so: i fucking love it.
Limits removed, I used it to get fiat cash, buy stuff in physical stores and the web (even a 2k euro transaction) without any problem.
Definitely worth the few euros I paid for it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:59:59
Coindesk app startes crashing, too
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:20:37
I wouldn't touch this with a 10 feet pole without first auditing the code.
@_date: 2016-06-25 01:21:15
"IGG Software, Inc. is a small company based in Putney, Vermont, USA"
So, they are the only ones knowing what's going on? I doubt it.
@_date: 2016-11-20 22:02:34
I live up a hill in the country, and I'm seriously thinking about setting this up to broadcast the price to the whole neighborhood :D
This is awesome!
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:13:03
As old as this is, it sounded hilarious in the middle of a quite serious discussion
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:27:35
Blockfolio ( has been doing this, pretty well, for a while now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:16:49
Oh well, guess I never needed those features :D
I'll keep an eye out for the Android version ;)
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:27:56
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:39:32
Almost no public internet infrastructure. Good luck with that.

This is what I was responded a few months back asking the same thing.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:02:49
Didn't work in my case, I got a human replying "trust us, you'll be fine". Obviously I didn't.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:01:32
I've had the same experience, and none of the data on the document was covered by the watermark. It was only startegically placed to try and prevent reuse. Colour high quality scan. Wasn't enough.
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:37:09
This is so fucked up I just can't wrap my head around it. WTF
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:22:14
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:22:13
This place was cool back in 2006 when I was in Prague, and I'm extremely pleased to know that it's involved in crypto!
Took some picture digging to make sure this was the same place I had been to, and it actually is!
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:22:31
In proportion, so is fiat
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:13:07
Sifu? Or I didn't get it?
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:40:26
404 here
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:00:16
Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2016-10-28 09:22:25
All you need is to be cut off from the internet.
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:34:35
That's the first time I hear about g2a.com accepting bitcoin, and I've used them before a few times. Can't find anything about bitcoin on their website.
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:56:07
I just registered to buy fallout 4, but I have no bitcoin payment option at checkout, only pp and credit cards. What now?
edit: Seriously, why only allow bitcoin payments when dollar currency is used? Are you serious? WTF!
@_date: 2015-11-10 00:32:20
"This payment option is only available if your account shows prices in USD. We hope to add other currencies very soon."
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:37:16
Gonna spam request to this url in the hope that he sees the webserver logs.
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:08:58
Wait, are you serious? 12.5% fee?
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:32:01
Guess you meant the shitchain
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:46:41
When was this picture taken? The price is ridiculous
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:26:52
Damn I lost it on that Lambo
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:07:48
Hi Jessie,
I'm writing you a PM. But this is to publicly clarify that I already lifted my limits a few months ago.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:16:03
I definitely have 2FA activated...
@_date: 2013-06-13 08:00:26
Ha. *Two weeks*.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:09:22
Same here, just made a new post about this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:09:12
Kid, that's a trading system, not a joomla install.
Anyway, what happened was definitely predictable.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:07:21
Can I have that bench?
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:40:25
That's poetic
@_date: 2013-09-04 12:42:29
Too late... but I had a trusted machine, disabled and reconfigured 2steps auth.
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:51:24
Am I the only one not trading bitcoin and waiting for them to raise their value to hundreds of dollars in the next year?
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:13:37
I'm not going to put a single cent on mtgox anymore. I'll just keep my btc in the closet, waiting for their fucking (incompetent) monopoly to end.
@_date: 2013-07-08 10:48:18
"All sales are final"
They already got the money. They couldn't care less.
@_date: 2013-07-26 09:48:42
Update: first withdraw just arrived (July 26th) after almost 2 months.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:02:15
More upvotes would be appropriate.
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:04:42
I'm verified.
First withdraw €1500
Second withdraw €2000
@_date: 2013-06-13 12:40:52
I don't like BBT. It's it made from normal people, not for geeks.
And this is the proof.
edit: I missed 'like'
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:04:17
That's what you get for using .com domains
@_date: 2013-04-30 10:04:21
This is exactly what we need to make bitcoin fly: PR0N!
The market is BIG, BIG, and again, BIG
@_date: 2013-05-30 13:24:10
I went for the verification straight away.
It took a while, tho.
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:58:26
Given the doubt of this being real or not...
You use paypal? That's what you deserve... They've been trying to cut bitcoin's legs since the beginning.
@_date: 2013-10-14 08:14:33
^ ^
This guys is legit
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:25:15
I can confirm this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:27:58
@_date: 2013-10-03 12:53:57
That's what they said long time ago... And look what we have now.
Hope SR goes the same way.
