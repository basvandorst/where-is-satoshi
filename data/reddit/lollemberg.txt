The track goes left right left right left right left right.
When you know this, looking Bitcoin straight in the eyes, you can choose wheter he's going forwards or backwards.
You can even switch direction at will.

How can you blame him? He's playing a game with no rules, how can you judge his behaviour?
I'm sure he's a dick with no interest in bitcoin, but only in money.. 
But really, what did you expect? Bitcoin is 99.9% speculation right now and you blame him for speculating?
Just asking, I don't mine and ain't got a satoshi, but I love the idea of bitcoin. Even though I hate the idea of the speculation on bitcoin

I don't have btc why NOW I should buy something with btc?
I hate banks too, don't get me wrong. I just don't understand why, even in 55 years, I should buy something in btc or either btc should (even for a small part) replace dollars.
It seems to me that btc are worth only for a "small" group of people and not for everybody
For an average joe like me, btc is too difficult, to paranoid and too risky
ok, if a send to my mom in canada from france 2k dollars banks take a big % of that 2k. But that's it, no other pros for me. 
PLease enlighten me I'm fascinated by bitcoin, but I can only see cons.

I thought we already understood that Bitpay is not freaking Bitcoin.
Like NOBODY ever payed DIRECTLY in bitcoins for a pizza, a Tesla, a Lamborghini and on the other big onlinestores over there.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:29:03
They accept dollars from Bitpay which accepts bitcoin for you.
I'm not an expert on economics/bitcoin/rockets, but as far as I can tell, right now is Bitpay that is accepting bitcoins.
Where am I wrong? Why evereybody is excited and I'm not? (I don't have btc or ever had, so I'm neutral on btc)

Bad things happen everytime everywhere for everything. But people still does things and stuff. Life goes on, world doesn't fall.
The hype around bitcoin is too high, the stupid(?) firm belief that price can only go up is too strong.
Don't worry Braz, bitcoin will raise again.

You're a speculator at its finest.
You ask me why you're a dick? THAT'S WHY.
But let me stress it another time: you're in a game with no rules, so you HAVE to find the best and most profitable rules for you. 
And if you find rules that will destroy bitcoin, you HAVE to destroy it.
If btc is good, he will survive if btc is not good, you and your friends will have destroyed it.

Every time a scam happens, I'm happy. Not because I'm poor and jealous. 
But because it reinforces BTC.
The day people will learn that a decentralized system must be used in a decentralized way, it will be a good day.

Thanks, but what I don't understand is that Visa accepts dollars and pays let's say Dell, with dollars.
Bitpay accepts btc but pays Dell in dollars. I don't know or can explain a difference, but to me it seems very different.
I see your point on investors and I'm sure the sistem works (or at least for now), but all I see are marketing moves from big companies and it is only good for them, not for bitcoin itself. As a matter of fact btc price remains the same or it is even going down because to me it's the same if I buy a pc in dollars or bitcoins..
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:29:41
Ok, forget the murder. There's a rock, ok?
There's a rock on a mountain. A big rock on a big mountain. And you want to destroy it. Now the question is: "is that rock so powerfull to defend itself from you?"  
And the answer is: yes, until you use conventional weapons. You could stay there for ages slappin that bitch, but you will only hurt yourself.
Now you really want to destroy that bitch, ok? And you try with a hammer. Guess what, that bitch is a really tough bitch, and now you got a perfect rock and a broken hammer.
You're starting to get mad so you decide to take a uzi this time. Yes, a fucking uzi. Too bad the rock wins again. "Dear Lord" you think.
Now you really really REALLY want to destroy that fucking rock, ok?!  You used natural weapons (your hands), prehistorical weapons (the hammer) and a mother fucking uzi.
It seems there's nothing you can do about it and that rock own'd you really really badly.  
But you're farting filames now, because you don't want to lose. But there's only one weapon left. And now bad news arrive, because the last weapong you can use is the atomic bomb. Yup, Enola Gay is ready to fuck new asses. And it wont regret it.
That's what he's doing, ok guys? He's calling a B-29 and killing us all just because he wanted to destroy a stupid rock, no matter what. And you actually can't do nothing about it when someone calls a B-29 loaded to drop an atomic bomb. Because an atomic gives no shit and fucks you right in the ass. And the only thing that will remaing about you is a fucking shadow being fucked by an atomic bomb that is fucking you right in the sphincter. And her name is Enola Gay.
Funny, right?
Moral of the story: if you call a mother fucking Enola Gay and you beg him to kill us all, it's not that bitcoin should die because it can't defende himself. it's that bitcoin is dead because we chose to die and bring it with us.
inb4 you're comparing a bomb to a digital currency

To the customer, what's the difference to pay AN XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT in btc or in dollars? No difference. So why buy btc and then buy the xbox account?!
Obviously 2009/2010 adopters created money from nothing and now they can gain from that. But people who want to buy btc TODAY why would they buy a pizza, an xbone account or a bike in btc?
I'm just curious, I don't know the answer.

In my stupid opinion bitcoin should have a fixed value in dollars. Volatility is at the same time his weakness but also his power so I know this will never happen for 34535k reasons, but still..

I already said it: r0nj0hn3  is a dick and there's nothing you can do about it. And I actually don't care.
You want a system without rules, but don't cry if someone breaks it.
Then someone said: If bitcoin dies is because it HAD to.
And I just said: It doesn't die until you want to kill it. And kill it really badly.
It's not an argument on rules or not rules, laws or not laws, ffs.
I was just stating that EVERYTHING can be destroyed if you want to.
No matter what. Attacking is easier than defending, because you're in advantage. You can't defend a move/method that you don't know.
Hope I made it more clear, now (english is not my mother language, sorry) 
And I love to think that a bomb named Enola Gay fucks you right in the shit. How can I be more childish?! I don't even know. Sorry, my bad.

I've been trying from september.. Got scammed twice, dodged the third scam for a second. So, no. It's not as easy as opening an internet account.

I *think* he wanted to say: "You can do that only if you're mining litecoins(and even more affordable).. BUT even if you have many litecoins.. you just can't use them".  
Or you could trade them: you buy them a 2.53$ and sell them a 2.59$. Then buy them at 2.47$ and sell them at 2.54$.. And so on.
