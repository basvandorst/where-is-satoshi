oneshitskin idk do you play csgo? best game ever...and its a nice point of view in which you take on this issue. How many coins did you mine per day approx? Did you keep alot?
@_date: 2015-11-03 05:37:48
nope $400 on huobi 
@_date: 2016-05-11 03:22:54
"what some may not know is that Satoshi's coins, and all mining addresses from the first two-years of bitcoin's history, are vulnerable to quantum attack." why just coins from the first years?
