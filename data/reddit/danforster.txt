Semi tangentially, this sounds very much like economies in hyperinflation; like the cases where workers would get paid in the morning so they could rush out and buy groceries before the prices moved on them. Here the movement is both up and down, but as you can see the dilemma is the same. 
In commodities people hedge against these movements by locking prices in futures contracts, but no such market exists for bitcoin.

My concern with bitfinex is that I don't have confidence in the company itself. How well is it capitalized? What is their own exposure if the market totally collapses? What legal recourses do I have to extract liabilities from a company in Hong Kong? Can I entrust tens of thousands to a company that says it is still in beta?
I get the same itchy feeling from their website that I did from reading some MBS and credit swaps a few years ago.

As a followup: I've looked more into setting up an account, and learned that doing so requires one to send passport scans and other personal info to unknown foreign nationals! So it's a non-starter twice over.
Ironically this sort of thing is why I am so skeptical about bitcoin (the ecology of exchanges is still wild-west and totally untrustworthy), but at the same time it means one can't express that skepticism through trading!
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:22:41
There you are assuming that bitcoin can only go up. It would make a poor collateral for someone expecting it to lose value.
However, if you are convinced that the value of bitcoin can only increase, I am very eager to buy put options from you.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:55:12
Another way of saying this is: the most commonly given reason for buying bitcoins is so that you can sell them at a higher price to someone else later on. And the reason that person buys it is because *they* think they can sell it to someone else for a still higher price; and that person does so because they think they can sell it to someone else who thinks they can sell it to...
Basically, the price only increases in value because you can sell it to people who think it will increase in value. Ultimately you run out of those people.

They probably didn't, because there is currently no effective way to short BTC. bitfinex's margin trading lacks both scale and trustworthiness.
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:38:48
Regarding the attitude to critics, I think it is something like this:
The people holding bitcoins now are doing so because they expect to sell them to someone else at a higher price. That someone else, in turn, will buy the bitcoins because they expect to sell them to a third person at an even higher price. And so on. This depends on each person in the chain believing that the value of bitcoins will continue to rise beyond their purchase price. So, anything that challenges the perception that bitcoins' price will rise indefinitely threatens the profits of anyone holding bitcoins. 
Many people come to this forum to boost bitcoins and protect their investments. Therefore those people are hostile to critics.

The web of trust doesn't do much to limit counterparty risk or enforce margin cover. It just says "a friend of a friend said this is a good guy to work with," but that doesn't protect me from that person going bankrupt. 
If someone gets totally wiped out in a market crash, they have more incentive to just walk away from their reputation and disappear than they do to sell their house to cover their debts. So what's necessary in an effective futures market is a way to ensure people have enough collateral for their trades.

following on this: when a bank gets robbed in the USA, the police and FBI relentlessly pursue the robber and throw him in prison. The conviction rate (once someone is arrested) is nearly 100% and the sentences very severe. This creates a deterrent effect. 
This does not happen with bitcoins. 
Look at it this way: physical banks don't even try very hard to physically secure their cash. If you show up waving a toy gun demanding money, they'll just give it to you. It's not the vault that stops thieves, it's the certainty that they'll either spend the next ten years in prison, or running from the Feds. So too the online "vault."

Well, given that I am paid in fiat currency, any bitcoin transactions have to start someplace exchanging fiat currency. Besides, yes, my intention is to profit from changes in the USD:BTC rate.
I'm not at all questioning the money-laundering laws. I feel I've benefited from their protection all my life. Rather, my issue is that none of the available counterparties are themselves trustworthy. 
Within the US there are various laws and civil protections that help me trust the businesses I'm sending information and money to. But bitfinex is not within reach of those laws.

The pound sterling was fairly stable 520 years ago.  For example, a pound of cheese cost about fourpence in 1600 and fivepence in 1700. Bread cost about 1 pence per pound in 1600, climbed to 1.4 pence per pound around 1640, back down to onepence in 1700. Prices of different commodities change relative to each other, but there don't seem to be many times with more than 2 or 3% annual inflation, in the numbers I can see.
(see the bibliography and math in "Average Earnings and Retail Prices, UK, 1209-2010" by Gregory Clark at UC Davis for the sources of those numbers)
As to going broke, I don't quite understand how inflation means your savings becoming worthless. Savings go in bank accounts, which pay interest, which generally keeps pace with inflation (or better). It's not like people just keep cash under the mattress.

In some countries you could run afoul of laws written to prevent exploitation by paying people in company scrip.
For example, in the UK, for many centuries there was a problem with workers being paid in barter goods, but at unfair valuation. For example, requiring workers to buy their own equipment (looms and the like), but only to buy them from their employer, who would of course gouge them. Or paying them in scrip that could only be redeemed at shops run by the employer, again giving them unfair prices. To combat this, parliament passed a series of Truck Acts (now the Employment Rights Act), requiring workers to be paid in "coin of the realm."  So, paying British workers in something other than pounds could be seen as trying to cheat them, under this law.
This came up in Mexico as well, where Wal-Mart there paid its employees in Wal-Mart vouchers that could only be spent at Wal-Mart. The Mexican supreme court ruled this unconstitutional.

No, there's no trustworthy clearinghouse.

This is a well established kind of bet on the stock market. You can make this bet with a put option: sell a contract that says, on (eg) June, he can sell you 5 bitcoins for $500 apiece.
If the price goes below $500, then he can buy the coins on the market and sell them to you at a profit. If it doesn't, then you keep whatever you sold the contract for.  If it goes below $500 and then comes back up, you both win.

The trouble with bookies is they go bankrupt. If the market moves against them, they have no way to cover all the bets. Investment banks deal with this by hedging their positions, but there is no way (today) to hedge BTC options. mpex, for example, overtly says they don't hedge their positions (  ) which means that if there is a big swing in price they are basically guaranteed to fold the way that AIG did. 
I'm not willing to make that kind of deal with someone unless they can either prove they've covered their position, or I have a lien on their property.

I have been going batty trying to find some trustworthy mechanism for trading btc options. bitfinex.com is margin trading, not quite the same thing. 
icbit.se is a futures exchange; I wanted options but futures is a start. However it's not clear to me how they can enforce payment from the counterparty. The exchange doesn't require people to maintain enough balance to cover their positions, its margin call process is rather vague, and I don't see what legal recourse is available against a counterparty who fails to fulfill the obligation. Also their "Rules" page has missing sections and imprecise language, which does not fill me with confidence.
Thus far the best I've found is to make private agreements with known persons, *eg* by adapting the language from a Form 91 and getting them to sign actual paper, but this is obviously not ideal.

It's very difficult to actually withdraw $ from MtGox. So when people sell their coins there, they tend to end up with a lot of $ piled up in their accounts that they can't get out. So there's nothing to do with it but buy more bitcoins. This distorts the price relative to other exchanges.
In a way, MtGox is inadvertently performing the same kind of currency control that *eg* China does, but backwards: it keeps the price of Bitcoin artificially strong by making it difficult to export dollars.
