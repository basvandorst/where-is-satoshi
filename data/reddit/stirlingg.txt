As someone who uses both, I'd say the ledger is better for security, but damn is trezor a better design of use. Mainly for their password manager and touchscreen interface. I really hope trezor gets a more secure design in the future to match the competition

It's currently valued solely as an auto manufacturer. Their cars are great and all, and they have a huge lead in Electric Vehicle and battery tech right now, but the real potential comes with the energy business and most importantly: Self driving.
If they corner full self driving hurdles in the next 2 years, they will have an unstoppable lead in the robotaxi business. All Tesla cars made after 2016 are potentially an asset generating cash flow, where as other companies in the self driving space will have to buy and design their own fleets from scratch. Personally I have one Tesla currently, and two more on order for 2021. Hoping to make a passive robofleet my main income in 3-4 years
I also think their model of complete vertical integration in everything will make their profit margins so massive on their cars in 2 or 3 years that they will absolutely wreck everyone.

You work for Ledger? You're bias seems a wee bit strong. I own a Nano S and X, and a Trezor Model T. The Model T is by far worth it for the ease of use factor. Even with the half baked bluetooth support of the X, Ledger is just not quite there yet in UI and Ease of Use.
Thinking about my password manager being on that small screen vs the Trezor browser extension seems painfully hard, but I'm glad you told me that's an option, it's good to know. I will continue to use my Model T regularly as a password manager. I store 50% of my BTC on it, and 50% on my Ledger X.  
I stand by my statement on the 99%.... 99% percent of people don't fall into the threat model category of "targeted by people with hardware based seed extraction techniques"

Ledger is more secure, but partnered with Intel, and not open-source. Trezor is open source, still secure for the 99% of people who would have it, and has better features imo. A few that I like are: 
1.) easy to use touchscreen on the model T 
2.) Password manager application for your computer browser (this is my favorite part of it)

That's fine, but my recommendation would be to make a new wallet in your Trezor via the passphrase function (more secure anyways), and put your mixed coins into the new wallet. The big rule to follow is just don't mix the two together in the same place. Another good idea is to use electrum on desktop to manage your spends from your secure wallet. (coin control), which will make sure you're not spending multiple outputs of clean coins in the same transaction. Personally I just use mixed coins as super secure long term savings for fun, so I haven't spent any yet :)

if you're using a mobile wallet service, you are showing that your phones IP address is linked to your wallet public key.

You're totally right. It's all the same bullshit with stocks, but at least bitcoin is useful. Save every sat you can. When it's "up", sell a little bit off by buying stuff 15-30% off on [purse.io]( when it's down, keep on saving. I wish I could "spend" my stocks. but I have to wait for market open, sell shares, wait for a deposit to my bank, then transfer it to my cash app card, then spend. lol.

a huge thing.... host all your own data. Synology NAS system is what I use, and it's freaking brilliant. it allows encryption of your drives, private syncing to all devices hosted by you, hosting your own VPN, drive redundancy, and offsite backup (to another NAS preferably). And it's fairly easy to buy a domain with to log in anywhere from. You can even host your own end to end encrypted chat on it, but it's hard to convince friends and family to use lol. No more paying for google drive, apple cloud, office 365 onedrive to spy on your data.

probably on a hot wallet on their phone no biggie
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:24:03
My advice --- Have a spare phone or Ipad with Edge wallet on it.. Accept many crypto types on it, immediately exchange them for bitcoin in the exchange tab of the app.. Following this, each transaction you recieve can be labelled for what type of transaction it was. ie. Sale, Expense, etc. This way you can keep records depending on how official you want your business. Following these steps, you will have bitcoin and other cryptos accepted. Either Sell them or Hodl them for your business. Personally I recommend hodling them, but it may paying your expenses a bit harder.

I think your view of modern libertarian is skewed personally. most liberts i see today just want smaller government to stop people like the dumb lawmakers trying to ban everything. Honestly both sides have points, but I'd rather have the option to choose, and with libertarianism you get that, with government they choose for you, usually for their own pockets. And it's government regulation that makes companies like that insulin one thrive, because they can lobby cronies in washington to regulate competition out of existence too

never used greenwallet, samourai has shady dealings in the past, but I hear good things about their app lately. Personally I use Edge Wallet for my hot wallet on the phone.

I use trezor as my savings wallet and wasabi wallet on the desktop to zerolink coins before saving them..

Edge is definitely my favorite. Easy to use, Open source, All the important cryptos (BTC, BCH, XMR, ETH, etc.) are supported in one wallet, and you can just exchange between them with a few taps and no KYC between them .
it's definitely the most useful hotwallet.
EDIT: And sidenote... as someone who owns a ledger and a Trezor, I highly recommend checking out the Trezor Model T. You probably don't need it, but I love it worlds more than the nano S I started out with

It's much better to replace before spending. (about to buy a 50 dollar product w/ bitcoin? buy 50+ dollars of BTC, then send same day for purchase.) 
By buying and spending the same coin immediately, you don't have the capital gains liability. 
If you're spending from your saved BTC, then you have to do calculations of worth when purchased.

do you have a source on this? I know someone who has bought like 600k total and I see him posting cash app screenies all the time of his buys

can anyone tell me why it would be worth it to pay 300 dollars /  year for a 100 dollar node
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:56:08
I've seen the sentiments and I don't want 2x, but what do I do with my bitcoin if when they're going through with the hardfork regardlessly? 
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:02:47
I'm on your side. We need to upgrade for quantum resistance BEFORE it is broken, not "WHEN IT IS NEEDED". Developers are not innovating bitcoin as fast as they used to. Pushing it til later is a bad time waiting to happen.
apparently googles Quantum computer did a computation that the strongest computer in the world would have needed 10,000 years to do.. If this does not worry people, then they deserve what's coming. It seems like too many people have complete faith in this technology; which is so ironic in a so called "Trustless" enviroment.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:38:10
Only bad news I've heard recently is google's Quantum supremacy. (They have a working quantum computer that is significantly faster than largest supercomputing networks in the world)

I had no idea Overstock took BTC. So awesome. Is there a list of major retailers accepting?

I think the most important part of this small article is the idea of self deployment. There should be a common element to the software that runs a node. right now it's split into many different types. Ie. BTCPayServer, Electrum Personal Server, etc. Why hasn't a universal distribution standard been implemented? There should be like a magnet link on an everychanging torrent with the node platform

According to the articles about the NASA leak, Google is estimating cracking SHA256 within 2 years. Thats a redflag to me; IMO we better have resistance in 1 year or less!

How do I do this without losing money on fees everytime I withdraw?
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:45:41
Maybe it is playing god, maybe not. Bitcoin is rooted in god... or really fundamental laws of nature that are unbreakable, IE. prime numbers being infinite and impossible to easily guess, and that is why people have faith in it. 
Quantam resistance needed will be a factor of making our numbers random enough that even quantum computers can't guess it quickly, but it makes it very slow for miners to be using convential computers. Better to be slow and not broken, then to see the system collapse, though.

Better to use cash app debit card at whole foods, 5% off and you can just sell the bitcoin you have straight from that app!

It's exciting but also scary. I hope it's used for things like election, but i really hope it's not used for data analytics (it will be)
