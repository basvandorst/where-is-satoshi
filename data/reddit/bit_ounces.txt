paper wallet, dollar cost average (buy some bits each week and send it to the paper wallet, keep it a secret until you hand it over)
CLTV should also work, but I think you totally lose control until the specified date is reached.
If you are afraid you can't hand over the paperwallet yourself, you can put the keys in your testament and state they are to be handed over when your children reach 18 years of age.

What kind of comparison is that?
Bitcoin is open, the bitcoin protocol can be updated, there is no way to just make a better product without changes at once being merged into bitcoin. 
This is it man.

Consider this: real USD inflation is way above 1-2%, the CPI numbers you get are adjusted by using weighting and "technological improvements"
With QE and ZIRP now we also have inflated stock- and real-estate markets, which of course benefitted those who already owned those assets most.
It's simply a racket, that's why there's some emotion involved. We are getting fleeced as we speak. Not many people seem to realize this yet though.
