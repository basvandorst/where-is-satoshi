You can donate to Mentor Me India. 
 - **What does this organisation do?**          
    It provides Mentors to underprivileged children. The mentors give them lessons, teach them and try to give and help them achieve a goal in their life.            
- **How can you help?**                
   By donating to the cause. You can even come forward and become a mentee for a child. 1 pair of mentor and mentee costs Rs. 12,000 (0.02 BTC), so with 1 BTC, you will be helping 50 such children study and learn for 1 full year. 
The goal of this donation is much less than 1 BTC but its a variable goal that can be extended once earlier goal is hit.

This organisation doesn't allow direct donation in BTC, so only way I could find was to give my own BTC address and later on transfer the money into INR and give it to this charity.
My BTC Address - **123kZDcipBmvQo5wHppTNwedThHn3vcSDc**
               
For other people looking at this post and liking the idea of supporting an underprivileged child's study can please come forward and donate directly on the link, or to my wallet and then PM me their txn id and details so I can send you some proof. Thank you. :)

ever heard of shorting bitcoins? that is basically buying bitcoins with bitcoins. (not really, but you get more bitcoins in return if price goes down and vice versa)
