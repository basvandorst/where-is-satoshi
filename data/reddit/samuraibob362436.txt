Yes, countries banning bitcoin is good for bitcoin. /s

Governments wanting to ban Bitcoin does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin provides power to the individual over that government that the government is seeking to take away from that individual. That may be the case, but it also may be the case that there is some other, much more benevolent reason.

That is a misleading question. If something is banned, it may be pushed into the black market due to demand that still exists for that item. Technically, the price goes up for that good, but as that good becomes illegitimate (illegal/banned), the overall amount of demand dramatically goes down, as most people do not wish to participate in illegal activities. The increase in price represents the risk involved in dealing with the item, not the increase in demand or value of the item. 
Sometimes, being banned or illegal can actually lower the value of items. A good example of that is stolen property, which often has to be "fenced" to people or businesses (ex: a shady pawn shop that doesn't shy away from selling stolen goods). When an item is "fenced", it is dramatically lower in value than a legitimate item. 
Another example would be the market for banned firearms in Australia. Australia enacted new gun legislation in the mid-90's which required citizens to turn in many of their firearms and dramatically restricted the purchase of new firearms. Today, if you tried to buy a banned firearm (ie: black market) in Australia, they are probably available, but are very expensive. However, most people turned in their firearms as they were legally required to, so the overall availability and "value" of second-hand firearms in Australia is dramatically lower.

True, but the fact that the currency is deflationary provides a disincentive to invest. The investment has to have a higher return for an investor to find it worthwhile.

Deflation also means decreased investing... because why put your money into a risky venture when you can earn a return just by it sitting around, risk-free?

That's speculation, much like Gold. 
Not saying cryptocurrencies are a bad bet, but know that you're speculating and that there isn't an actual increase in real value to match the money you're putting in. It may pay off, it may not.
