That’s like saying “if i put it on a hardware wallet, nuclear war could ensue and it’s worth nothing anyway!”. You’re minimizing your risk with a hardware wallet, full stop. If coinbase goes under and your coins are there, your chances of still having bitcoin after a potential recovery are much lower.

Get out of here with your sensical advice!

I love how you're getting downvotes for sensible, proven investing advice. You can be pro-Bitcoin and still want to diversify.

Which means that blip fell much faster than it rose over those 7 days...

It’s just not sensible or convenient at the moment for a lot if people to transact on a daily basis with BTC. For some people, it’s the superior option and it’s great that they’re using it as a currency. For everyone else, it still helps the growth and future of BTC to buy and hold.

How did you take the time to comment but not take the time to read the entire post? He goes on to say “This is obviously a fallacy.”

Ah, well then you may be out of luck if you’re trying to buy in a hurry. I would say just purchase the BTC directly if it’s time sensitive rather than transferring in USD first.

When you buy BTC on coinbase using a bank transfer, it locks in the price at the time of purchase. It just takes a week or so for the purchased coins to appear in your account.

If I were to invest in ETH and BTC, what percent of capital should I invest in each? I’m looking to hold for the next 4-5 years.
