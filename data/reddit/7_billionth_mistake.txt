Have you "tested" it? I did a little and got banned pretty quick.

Maybe he meant "books", as in, the "order books" of Bitcoin ETF buyers?
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:04:29
Not me, other people.

ok, will do, selling $10,000,000,000 in bitcoin now.

Thank you Core for being the only voice of reason in the Bitcoin world! So much hate for you outside this forum, people just don't know how much great work the Core team is doing.

Thinking Samson Mow may be a bad meme generating bot at this point.

Thanks random smart guy for sharing your unfounded fears about digital currency with us.

TL:DW it makes no sense.

Gavin was never Chief "Scientist" of Bitcoin, there nevre was such a title. The closest thing to "chief scientist" bitcoin has ever had is Satoshi Nakamoto at first and now u/nullc

r/btc is the worst sub on reddit, the only reason they are here is to shit on bitcoin and real bitcoin devs.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:09:04
No, but maybe you should try listening to Core Devs, like u/luke-jr who do know more than anyone else about what Bitcoin is and how it should work.

Bitcoin fees are way lower than any competitor, anyone complaing about fees does not understand basic economics. Please stay calm, pay the fee and listen to the devs who actaully know what they are talking about.

True, u/nullc, Adam Back and team are the best team we could want for bitcoin, some incredibly smart guys here.

Segwit helps bitcoin, you segwit blockers want to hurt bitcoin for some reason with a dangerous hard fork instead of a soft fork. Come one and get with the program already. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:21:58
That is actually a picture of Greg Maxwell in his early days. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:17:24
Just think about, which one sounds better to you, soft-fork, or HARD-fork. Come on and lets activate segwit already!

Why, u/nullc is more of a scientist then Gavin will ever be. Only Greg has stuck around to actaully make Bitcoin work, not like gavin who abandonded the project at the first sign of trouble. I am supried we are not calling Greg Chief Scientist of Bitcoin yet, he is clearly one of the few that actually cares.
