Haha, deal. Sounds good.

How long do you think I'll have to wait for the transaction?

You have purchased with a credit card from coin base? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:57:23
So in Coinbase, I was just able to link my personal account and buy coins.  GDAX platform does not support this?

Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:52:16
Thanks.

How are they different?

I agree fiat is worthless, but at least it’s backed by a promise from a government.  What is Bitcoin backed by. . . an anti-regulatory sentiment of believers?  I contend it’s just as worthless and we’re all just prospecting.

Wow you’re butt hurt.  And for no reason.  You need to get a grip.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:20:17
No, it’s not comforting, I agree.  But who is guaranteeing Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero?  Nobody.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:28:19
Gold backs gold. . . Because there is a finite amount and mankind has beheld it since the beginning of time.  Bitcoin is finite too, I get it, but if it goes to zero, which is a real possibility, then what are you left with?  Gold doesn’t go to zero, it still exists, which is why it’s a backer.  
Bro, you’re so enlightened.

I don’t want to stop Bitcoin, not even in the slightest. The point is that OP can’t predicate an entire argument on the fact that one worthless thing is less worthless than another, when said things are both backed, at best, by the faith of their users.

I agree, that’s powerful, and I am excited to be part of it. But at its root, we give the same respect to fiat currencies.  The point is there is no underlying asset. It’s just like buying an ETF.  It’s made up units derived from something else.  Just because we value it, doesn’t make it valuable. It’s valuable as money because there’s finite scarcity; we just happen to value those attributes.  The implicit promise of Bitcoin is that exchanges and brokerages will continue to mine transactions so long as you continue to pay a fee.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:52:53
Exactly, they’re both worthless.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:46:53
Not, what are the principles and concepts it’s predicated upon. What backs it and gives it value?  Mathematically the block chain is solid and transparent, got it.  Crypto currencies are a time and energy suck!  So much so that’s it’s prohibitive for you and I to mine.  It only works as is because exchanges are supplemented by transaction fees paid in, guess what, fiat!  Exchanges don’t care about the founding principles of Bitcoin, as evidenced by their relinquishment of our anonymity.  Once the exchanges began reporting trades to fiat, Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin.

^username checks out.  The implicit promise to pay their debts and not abandon their currency system so as to not send your accumulated wealth to zero.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:20:25
Mining will have to be conducted on a for-fee basis, paid by requestor and/or sender.
