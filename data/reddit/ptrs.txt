Awesome. So what's standing in the way between every BTC transaction being a Lightning transaction? Would there be a fork involved? 
Dumb it down for me, I am not a very smart man.

You gave a site your Gmail password?!
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:31:45
And the ones who are really smart don't divulge how many BTC they own.

"your own wallet" being an offline wallet? Any recommendations? 
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:22:23
Thanks Rosey!
My purchases in the past have been swift: less than 1 hour. 
Also, the Coinbase app says that the BTC are to arrive by the end of Jan 3. They have not.
Should I be concerned?
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:45:54
Thanks for the extensive reply. 
Would you care to elaborate on "don't use Blockchain and Coinbase wallets"?
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:32:06
I know. I never said it's free. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:32:52
Elaborate please.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:53:21
Thanks for the clear answer!
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:24:50
Also, I'm based in Singapore and using Xfers as counterpart. 
Please advise.
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:45:07
Thank you, very informative. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:03:32
Thanks - support ticket 
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:14:02
Update: Coinbase staff have resolved the issue swiftly.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:31:32
Noted. Is it economically feasible otherwise?
@_date: 2016-01-03 05:07:36
Thanks for the elaborate reply!
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:09:00
That escalated quickly. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:55:38
Noted, thanks. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 09:17:27
Exactly. So what would you recommend I do at this stage? I'm a relative noob in this domain.
@_date: 2016-01-05 09:16:27
Are you sure? In the past my purchases went through in less than 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:54:42
Ok, what's the best way to transfer the BTC / BCH from the paper wallet to an exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:04:03
Thanks for the detailed response. 
Can I use blockchain.info to send BCC to another address? Or only BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:25:11
Irrelevant PRC dumbass.
@_date: 2016-12-31 10:41:43

Interesting discussion on gun rights. 
- had the guy owned a gun, he would have likely died (shootout with multiple assailants wearing bulletproof vests)
- HOWEVER, had the assailants *known* the guy had a gun, they would likely not have attempted the robbery in the first place
Game theory.

of course not. It's a store of value. You don't pay at the store with nuggets of gold, do you?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:12:16
Please don't

If your portfolio only fluctuates by 2k per week I'm not sure I can take your opinion seriously.

Wow. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:49:12
The fact that you can't imagine ever having that amount of money doesn't mean OP is lying. 
Furthermore, OP signed a message with his private key. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:51:24
Better go all in on QRL then! /s
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:24:57
Looks like OP removed their post already. Jesus that was some dumb drivel.

The encryption market?!
@_date: 2011-12-02 10:42:18
So apparently there is an encryption function in the latest Bitcoin client (0.5). 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:28:47
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:39:22
And hope nobody finds it?

Just found out about the conference Deconomy on  - what an awesome speaker roster. 
If I had known about this conference beforehand I'd have gone; how do I stay abreast of leading conferences and events in the blockchain/crypto space? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:38:38
And for the record, I don't hold Bcash but hold a large % of my portfolio in BTC. 
@_date: 2011-12-02 10:04:38
Thank you guys, did not notice the 'encrypt wallet' setting. (I previously used Bitcoin 0.2 where that option was not available). 
@_date: 2011-12-13 10:08:29
Cool, but what's that silver coin with the Bitcoin logo on it? 
What else is in the bag? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:01:55
How so? Genuine question.

Why the fuck would you tell your colleagues you own Bitcoin. Massive OpSec risk.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:02:40
What was the reason you've closed your account with them? 
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:09:50
