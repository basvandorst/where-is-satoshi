B2X is a failed attack. BCH might be a close call. BTC will rising like a phoenix from the ashes. Markets are dynamic, every attack will take us closer to the decentralized future. 
I see these attacks are incentives for the capitalists to get involved in the movement. They are being sucked in. We need them to take bitcoin mainstream. For time being, let them believe they can control Bitcoin.
As a community, we will lose a few battles but win the war

yes, great accurate summary. To those people who say there is no intrinsic value, I ask them to counterfeit this bitcoin currency. The intrinsic value is in not being able to be counterfeited. Bitcoin is the world's most secure safe to store a token of ownership. It is as valuable as the information you are storing. (currency is one such information). Indian National bank SBI is working on storing KYC information of customers using blockchain, I think 2018 is the time when governments will help make bitcoin the unifying currency of the world. Just like internet connects us all without boundaries, bitcoin helps us transact without boundaries.  BTW interesting point on ICO's.. I didnt follow that development.

this is the most brilliant piece written in these uncertain times for bitcoin, no where else you will find a better piece of advice.. twitter+reddit+chatrooms combined. THE WISEST ANSWER i read recently
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:40:59
there should be a website recording their stances and double standards, trying to manipulate the crypto movement for centralization. and name the website like bitscums.com

BCH will win for the next 6 months. then BTC will bounce back with updates to speed up transactions. everyone will jump aboard again. cycles of adoption

true and decentralized street capitalism is better than wallstreet capitalism

How do you think the prices will play out: given Jihan and Ver are pushing for BCH flippening BTC. Low fees, fast confirmations and mining profitability are on their side(BCH). But it could eventually be centralized in future with Miners influence. Will the Bitcoin core survive this intelligent drama and core dev team gets to maintain the decentralized nature of bitcoin. Sends chills down my spine thinking bitcoin could be centralized if we fall for BCH now. I am not pushing any ideas here or taking sides..  I'm totally clueless by what is going to happen. BCH rise could be good for midterm. Say BCH flippens BTC and both co-exist. Ultimately BTC may come out on top with improvements next year.
from what I understand: 
* BTC core is decentralized and will always be run by Core dev team- Best choice for future. 
* B2X was a failed centralization effort by the West/bankers
* BCH is an ongoing centralization effort by the East/miners
No East, No west Just give our community the BEST

true.. one can either be a true believer or pro trader. not both. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:17:18
yes thats what seems to be encouraging, there is a lot of opportunity with bitcoin, these fund managements cant wait longer. Bitcoin is becoming inevitable, while the traditional banking system is surviving on a ventilator support. This if true reason behind the latest interest, would be great. I think the investment bankers will make billions in an year, if they manage to get the approvals from SEC, which could be easier under a trump's government who easily takes the side of bankers for self interests. all in all, super for BTC!

i guess the last crash will be when china makes another move against some exchanges still operating in China, there are atleast half of Chinese bitcoin holders undecided on holding them. 
First they made central bank announcement
Then third party ban
Next cracking down on exchanges which crossed the January deadline, that would lead to a considerable volume sell off from china.
However if USA and Europe countries bring in some good adoption news, the china town effect wont be seen.
Just my guess

if you dont mind, can you explain how bitfinex works, the terminology is alien to me
A trader takes your 200$ and invests for a bitcoin price fall..what happens if price rises?
