You don't understand US law. The FBI is allowed to hack foreign computers, and ask for them to be seized without warrant if they have no reason to believe there is an American with a proprietary interest in them. There is precedent where they did this against servers in Russia.
Furthermore, even if it was parallel construction to hide the NSA's involvement in identifying the servers initially, its not illegal because the servers are international and the communications the NSA tracked in order to locate the servers were international. There is no underlying "poisonous" action. However, the NSA may have reason to want to hide its penetration of the Tor Network; likely that they have it completely compromised.
Parallel construction is only unlawful if it is used to hide a breach. If it is used for legitimate reason, it is fine.
Internationally for US operatives, very few things are computer crimes, and Ulbricht never asserted a proprietary interest in the machines at question, so there was no basis to even investigate if there was a privacy interest brief.

Part 1/2 (part 2 of 2 will be posted in 9 minutes, I'm limit restricted).


There is no objective morality. There is subjective, or context based morality.


Sure you can create morality; or rather, groups can. What is normative or moral behavior changes over time and with context.
This is basic moral relativism, for example, societies which practice cannibalism.


Oh god. I know where this is going. Getting into this as a discussion of contract law is getting into the weeds and irrelevant, because contract law is more or less a creation of the society which you are a part of.
In order to receive the protections of contract law, you must be a participant to the social contract. If you claim you are not a participant to the social contract, then you have no "rights" or "protections" and can be treated as an outsider/foreigner and are only subject to the restrictions of the State of Nature, which are none.
You can either accept the social contract, or we are allowed to kill you / remove you / do what we want with you. (Interestingly, a country like Germany actually requires the respect for all human beings as part of its Constitution, the US, does not, and only grants rights to US citizens, and those who are inside it).




This is a bad argument. Your parents granted your consent through proxy. You have already received the social and cultural benefits, such as access to food, water, protection from foreign entities, an education, etc... Since the contract is, in essence, continually renewed by your continued presence and in the case of societies which allow you to leave, you can terminate the contract whenever you like, the Statue of Frauds is irrelevant.
If you want to trace this back to the point at which the US Government was formed by the Constitutional Congress, yes, some people then were told they could accept the contract, they could fight to oppose it (ie fight for the British or something else), or they can leave.
There is nothing wrong with being presented this choice.


Stop using the word obligation. You are not required to take any action. You are offered a choice with different outcomes. Some of these outcomes might be favorable. Some might be unfavorable. It is up to you. In the state of nature, there is no right not to be threatened. It is only once you come under the protection of a society which you have such a socially protected right.
Children's choices are made for them by their parents, they can sue for emancipation within the system, and then they could renounce. They can also renounce at the age of majority.
In essence, the same way you inherit property from your parents, you inherit their agreement to the social contract.


So what? All of these requirements and protections are social requirements which require you to agree to the social contract.
You cannot raise any of these objections without first saying you have agreed to the contract, that it covers you, at which point these objections disappear.
If you make these objections in the State of Nature, I just laugh at you and say so what, and if I have more guys than you or better weapons, then I kill you if you fight.


More or less. It's a bit more complex because it is not just the Government, but social norms as well. For example, the government doesn't discuss certain issues, but society as a whole will have an opinion on them.


It's interesting that you bring up the idea of God. All concepts of natural law require a Judeo-Christian God. Natural rights come from the idea that man is created in God's images, and there is a superior authority which grants us rights and which to infringe on these rights would be an attempt to infringe upon God's rights. This is in essence the core statement of the Declaration of Independence. 
It was necessary because the governing framework was based, more-or-less, on the Divine Right of Kings.
The Constitution, however, signaled a departure from the authority of God in the natural world, to the authority of man (or collections of men). Nothing is restricted should enough people agree upon it, and authority to rule is not derived from God but from the People.
So in some senses, it is in fact a replacement for God.


More or less, yes.


No, because you used the word "if we are the society" and our society abhors these practices. You're only looking at these practices as wrong because of your position and education in our society.
Frankly, if you were raised as a white male slave owner in the South in the 1700s / 1800s, you would likely not have any objection to slavery, unless you attended University in the North.
Similarly, if you were raised as a Hitler Youth, you would not think the Nazi's actions were wrong.
It's not that one entity agreed to their labor or committed suicide, its that you would be unlikely to see anything "wrong" about the action.
To develop an individual view that certain actions like those are unequivocally wrong requires a lot of thought, and a lot of information— usually stemming from a concept of mutualism (being able to see part of yourself in another being and not wanting  something done to you, so you would not do it to them). This is in essence the underpinnings of a logically coherent social contract.
Remember, not all social contracts are logically coherent; in fact, that is why the US Constitution represented such a massive step forward. It is perhaps the first internally consistent and morally sound social contract (though there are some arguments to be had about Greek and Roman social contracts).


No. You've simply misunderstood. In the State of Nature, all beings have either equal claim or no claim to the entirety of the physical universe. You have no greater right to a particular tree or cave or water, than I do. You have the ability to utilize it, or claim it for yourself, but there's no right and I don't need to respect your use of it. When you assert that this is "your tree" or "your cave" you deprive me of my ability to use it for my own devices, and taken that from me.


No. It's just an admission that it is impossible to live without committing acts of aggression toward other creatures. It is a fundamental component of our natural, resource constrained universe.
If you attempted to live by the non-aggression principle, yes, you would die. 


It's not a right. There are natural abilities. I.e. that which I can do.


Again, it's not a right. It's a statement of fact. I physically can access it, just as any other creature can. If you stop me from doing so you have committed an act of aggression toward me and interfered with me.

To your original comment which was:






No, I just have the logical high ground. Or the high ground of being right.


I believe we all consent to a substantial amount of control and conformity in order to receive a variety of benefits. I think this is an observation of reality, rather than a belief.


That's not an argument against my rhetoric. It's an argument that perhaps we should look into political corruption.
Also, generally, one needs to be a bit sociopathic to be a politician. If you make decisions with empathy or emotion, you likely make bad decisions which do not benefit the larger whole.


Nope. I agree with government motives, and while there is some corruption, I don't think its a priority and I don't see a better or more viable system. We can certainly do more to prosecute and ferret it out, but it is not intrinsic to our societal structure. We were doing very well in the 50s-70s, but the rampant inequality of the last 30-40 years is very concerning.


Actually, the US greed machine will likely be what saves the human race; though we do need to reign in socioeconomic inequality before it becomes destabilizing.
And yes, I will laugh all the way to the bank.
That said, nothing you said is a reason for why you disagree. It's just a giant character attack against me.
It's sad you're not actually interested in defending your position. I'm open to modifying my positions when people make persuasive arguments. Apparently you're not.
To this latest one:


Ironically, if you took the time to articulate an argument, you might change my mind. But you haven't. You're more interested in attacking me.
You can believe in freedom all you want, but freedom only exists in the State of Nature. If you want that, that's fine, but the State of Nature is a miserable and ugly place where there is nothing to stop others from mugging, raping, killing, doing whatever they want to you simply because they are stronger than you.
Rather than focusing on being as strong as possible to survive, I'd like to participate in an abstract and complex society where I can translate doing weird things like making films into money which I can then transform into food and shelter for me and my family, and which I really don't have to think about being attacked by animals or other human beings.
I want these benefits. I love these benefits. If you see that as believing in control, so be it.
But I don't think you realize how shitty and miserable life would be if we gave up our society, and I don't think you realize that modern societies like the US already are the "voluntary" associations Libertarians and Ancaps lionize.
I simply don't believe you want the world you claim you want.

I'm actually a far left liberal. It's kind of hilarious that you missed that.
This comment also makes no sense in response to my above statements. Do you want to post a rejoinder? Or do you just want to put yourself on display as an unhelpful member of the Reddit community. The only thing I said which was mildly controversial was using force against someone who has engaged the US military. The rest was  just a straight reading of US law, and pointing out that you need specific intent for financial crimes in the US, and good luck finding it.
Also, you know that egregious isn't an insult in and of itself, right? I am egregiously what? Or what act of mine is egregious?
You also violated about a half dozen state laws and are headed for being banned if you tell people you hope they kill themselves.
Finally, I have no idea what you think is delusional, but here's a piece of advice. When you find someone has an opinion that differs from yours, and you find they're pretty good at articulating it, you might want to try to understand what the hell they are allying about. They might not be the delusional one- especially when you can't tell the difference between a progressive, liberal Statist, and a conservative, you myopic fuck. Cheers.

I am not picking apart with semantics and accusing me of speaking as though I am in court is a completely meaningless. It's subjective on your part, is a matter of style, and is in no way relevant to anything under discussion. I'm trying to articulate my points clearly because I know others are likely to disagree with them.
You did not give a reason for why and how facilitating drug sales is fundamentally different than importing them. I pointed that out.
You made a claim, and then made a bad analogy. I pointed out that you should have made a claim, explained your logic, and then made a structurally sound analogy if you so liked.


Actually, it very well could be. There are a huge number of Federal Laws governing interstate commerce, and while you could claim that you did not know X was being sold illegally on your site for some violations, not only are their other violations which don't require knowledge / intent (rather, there is a legal obligation to Know Your Customer), but in the case of Silk Road, it is very clear the owner operator knew what they were selling, recruited sellers, etc...
Additionally, when you take a commission of a sale, you are for all intents and purposes treated as the seller.
Uber's trying this argument all over the place and losing; it simply doesn't fly.


I actually don't know that I agree with this. Why do you believe you have this right?
More so, answer this: does the government have the right to find out about a legal purchase if it gets a warrant?
This is one of the issues with Bitcoin / Tor / anonymous transactions, etc...
If the government has a warrant and follows due process, it has the right to know everything about you. To me, that's part of our social contract.


It depends. For example, there was a motel that was often used for drug deals and prostitution. The Police were repeatedly called to it, repeatedly busted people. It was suspected that the owners encouraged the activity, but they weren't able to prove it. Eventually, they lawfully shut down the entire hotel because even if the owners did not know, they should have known. Wilful disregard is a thing.


Because its better for one person to be right and everyone else be wrong, than for everyone to be wrong.
r/bitcoin is a very insular community consisting largely of Libertarians and Ancaps, two similar but ideologically incoherent world views.
If I can get even one person to look at their position and rethink their assumptions, then its worth it.
I already have in the past, so I continue to now.
Why do you think a lot of people disagreeing with me would somehow be something I care about?
You yourself said I make solid arguments.
The world in general appears to agree with me; our society just sentenced him to life in prison.
You really should go take a look at some of the Wired articles on him, especially the transcripts of his chats recruiting potential new sellers, and ordering hits.

The punishment *does* fit the conviction.
Look up the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute. Here's the Wiki since I doubt you can parse the language: 
First conviction is 20 years to life imprisonment.
He was convicted. The Judge has discretion in sentencing.
Arguably, he was a "Super-King-Pin" which requires a mandatory life without parole minimum, but I don't think he was charged that way.

Part 2/2


I'm only going to address the first argument in your link, because without this argument everything else falls apart; and it fails.


Except the three "possibilities" envisioned in the Universe specifically do not cover all of the possibilities, that there is no such thing as a natural right, that no one has a right to own anything, and that we only have the natural ability to exert and support a claim, and no one owns anything until one exerts a claim. See the issue? 






I destroyed the argument with one sentence above, but this statement by the way, isn't even a refutation of the idea that we might all own small fractions of eachother or things. It claims 1) that the idea is absurd, which is not an actual logical refuation of the idea, and 2) that it is not practical or viable, which is also not a refutation of the idea.
This is simply bad logic and is contained throughout the works of people like Rothbard and Van Mises. It's why I roll my eyes whenever I hear someone is a Libertarian or Ancap.


Only because our social contract says we may not. In the State of Nature I certainly can. And that's not even true in all parts of the US.


A limited right of exclusive use as defined by the property laws enacted by Congress, supported by the Constitution and its inclusion of Common Law through the practice of Judicial Review.


Because we have a social contract. But in the state of nature, we can do whatever we want, so we form a social contract which exercises exclusivity over say, the territorial United States. And if an entity not a party to our social contract tried to fly over here without permission, we would probably kill them. That's what a failed invasion would look like.


What is wrong with the US killing off an indigenous population in order to establish itself?
Right of Conquest was a part of Common Law (pre-existing society) until about 1963. All of these acts occurred prior to 1963, have no conflict in the State of Nature, and had no conflict in the general "laws of man" at the time they were undertaken.
Based on its own rules it quite literally is the legitimate owner. This is a bad argument.


I've never said you have the obligation to do so. I have said I have the ability to hurt you, kill you, tax you, imprison you, do whatever the fuck I want to you if you are not a party to our social contract because you don't get those protections, and in the State of Nature the only thing stopping me would be if you are stronger than me; which is unlikely given in this case I have 300 million friends who will help me.
You are asserting that some part of this is "wrong" or "hypocritical." But you can't point out what part is wrong, and it is not hypocritical because my code of conduct, behavior, and ethics, only apply to those who also participate in the same social contract.
To those who do not, good luck.


In the State of Nature, if there is a mugger or rapist near you, you should either kill them or leave if you don't think you can kill them.
But the Universe does not care, and there is nothing intrinsically stopping them from mugging or raping you. The only defense is mutual defense through the creation of a social contract. You can argue that holding you in one against your will is wrong because it constitutes a violation of that contract, but we don't hold you in it.

But the Universe does not care, and there is nothing intrinsically stopping them from mugging or raping you. The only defense is mutual defense through the creation of a social contract. You can argue that holding you in one against your will is wrong because it constitutes a violation of that contract, but we don't hold you in it.

The punishment *does* fit the conviction.
Look up the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute. Here's the Wiki since I doubt you can parse the language: 
First conviction is 20 years to life imprisonment.
He was convicted. The Judge has discretion in sentencing.
Arguably, he was a "Super-King-Pin" which requires a mandatory life without parole minimum, but I don't think he was charged that way.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:59:58


There is so much wrong here.
First, it's not the harshest penalty possible. He could have been sentenced to death under the CCE Statute if the killing actually resulted. His intended actions would have exposed him to this sentence.
Second, there murder charge was not dropped. Murder is a State crime, so he will be tried in Maryland, only the NY charges were dropped. The Federal Case would not make any mention of the murder charges except for where applicable to their case, 1) in a bail hearing (flight risk), 2) to the charge of Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Third, the sentencing is pretty straightforward given the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statue.
Since he was the administrator, and the gross receipts were so high, the law directs the Judge to give a sentence of life in prison. By the way he was charged, it may have not been a mandatory minimum, but its certainly reasonable.
Fourth, it really doesn't matter what the public thinks, and there is no basis for the public to resist the idea of this sentence given what he was charged with. Only the uninformed and legally illiterate would be surprised.


Not true. These were separate agents engaged in a separate investigation.
They have since been charged and will likely be convicted or plea out.
While the law is of course allowed to break the law in order to serve the law, this is actually not an instance of this. You say this as though it is not reasonable. But of course a cop can run a red light to get somewhere quickly, and of course a narcotics detective can buy drugs or go undercover in order to bust a dealer.


No. It is only when they act as if they are beyond the law, break the law illegitimately, and then are not properly prosecuted, then there is no real justice to be had. This is not at instance here.


You imply this was a Kangaroo Court. Yet you have no evidence of any violation of due process.
He was a violent drug dealer who ran a massive criminal enterprise. He is lucky he was not sentenced to death. Murder-for-hire allows for a death penalty enhancement. Just counseling the intentional killing of someone, which he certainly did, is grounds for  the death penalty. (See the statute.)

I am not discussing justice or those who feel it is harsh.
I am discussing those who are surprised. And that does make them legally illiterate and uneducated, because reading the statutes would remove any possibility of surprise.
This is also not an ad hominem because it is specifically relevant to the topic under decision. People who do not take the time to be informed to a very basic level yet express opinions do not need to be listened to.
An ad hominem attack is when a debater impunes someone for an irrelevant characteristic, such as being fat. Attacking someone for ignorance of the matter at hand is not as hominem.
Your second oaragraph is entirely wrong. Very few people understand what he was sentenced for and why.

I am not picking apart with semantics and accusing me of speaking as though I am in court is a completely meaningless. It's subjective on your part, is a matter of style, and is in no way relevant to anything under discussion. I'm trying to articulate my points clearly because I know others are likely to disagree with them.
You did not give a reason for why and how facilitating drug sales is fundamentally different than importing them. I pointed that out.
You made a claim, and then made a bad analogy. I pointed out that you should have made a claim, explained your logic, and then made a structurally sound analogy if you so liked.


Actually, it very well could be. There are a huge number of Federal Laws governing interstate commerce, and while you could claim that you did not know X was being sold illegally on your site for some violations, not only are their other violations which don't require knowledge / intent (rather, there is a legal obligation to Know Your Customer), but in the case of Silk Road, it is very clear the owner operator knew what they were selling, recruited sellers, etc...
Additionally, when you take a commission of a sale, you are for all intents and purposes treated as the seller.
Uber's trying this argument all over the place and losing; it simply doesn't fly.


I actually don't know that I agree with this. Why do you believe you have this right?
More so, answer this: does the government have the right to find out about a legal purchase if it gets a warrant?
This is one of the issues with Bitcoin / Tor / anonymous transactions, etc...
If the government has a warrant and follows due process, it has the right to know everything about you. To me, that's part of our social contract.


It depends. For example, there was a motel that was often used for drug deals and prostitution. The Police were repeatedly called to it, repeatedly busted people. It was suspected that the owners encouraged the activity, but they weren't able to prove it. Eventually, they lawfully shut down the entire hotel because even if the owners did not know, they should have known. Wilful disregard is a thing.


Because its better for one person to be right and everyone else be wrong, than for everyone to be wrong.
r/bitcoin is a very insular community consisting largely of Libertarians and Ancaps, two similar but ideologically incoherent world views.
If I can get even one person to look at their position and rethink their assumptions, then its worth it.
I already have in the past, so I continue to now.
Why do you think a lot of people disagreeing with me would somehow be something I care about?
You yourself said I make solid arguments.
The world in general appears to agree with me; our society just sentenced him to life in prison.
You really should go take a look at some of the Wired articles on him, especially the transcripts of his chats recruiting potential new sellers, and ordering hits.
This guy is the scum of the earth, and is lucky not to be being executed.

Then you shouldn't say what's legal. Your comment is completely wrong.
It's absolutely legal to carry around over $10,000 in cash. You just might be questioned (and are likely to be questioned for really anything over about $2k or so) and you better be well documented and well prepared to answer. I personally don't do it.
What is illegal is transporting $10,000 across the US Border without declaring it. If you just declare it and report it, you're fine. It's essentially like any international bank transaction. It's not a big deal— its just that people who are usually moving that much cash have reason they don't want to report it.

You didn't say it was already out, and you have not named it. You can make your points here or not at all.


What are you talking about? You're just talking in circles.
He basically got caught in a trap where he put servers outside the country but did not realize that in order to assert his rights he would have to acknowledge he had a proprietary interest in them.
He was running a criminal enterprise and was an idiot, and didn't understand how US law works.


There are no holes.
There has been obfuscation by people with an agenda because 1) there was a secondary investigation by other agents and another department who have since been indicted, and 2) the source of identifying the servers is possibly the NSA and the result of parallel construction. However, parallel construction is not in and of itself a violation of due process, because what the NSA did, it did internationally to an entity not protected under US law, and then it gave the information to the FBI. It is a sound case, but is likely protecting the NSA's capabilities against Tor, which is reasonable.

It's not tainting if the Courts allow it and it follows the rules of evidence and criminal procedure.


I don't understand what you're saying here. I'm not saying the prosecution was allowed to get away certain things that weren't totally wrong. I'm saying the prosecution adhered to the law and ran a good case.
Also, the guy wasn't clear about what was dirty and how the defense was gagged, so I still don't know what you're talking about. Be very specific i.e. on X date the Judge did Y.


What the hell are you talking about? Make a specific allegation of a failure of due process.


Not really, I mean it may show the system's power, but it wasn't theater, and frankly what the guy was doing was illegal under any interpretation of the law, and there's no question he did it. I don't get what you're getting at here.


How so? I mean, if you mean asking the judge to be harsh on him, this happens all the time in many cases during sentencing depending on the Prosecutions understanding of the crimes. When you take a plea deal, and cooperate, you usually see a sentencing recommendation of leniency. But asking for strong sentencing isn't abnormal and doesn't imply impropriety.


Not really. And what the hell does freedom and control have to do with this at all?


Yes. Which is illegal and not in our interest as a society. If you don't like it, leave.

No, I said the above poster could leave "the society" implying a specific one. Contained in the statement was the assumption we were discussing the US, or at least a society which does allow you to leave, since obviously societies like North Korea do not.


It certainly is the case with the US. What another entity does to you is not the US' problem, even if it returns you to us, we will still allow you to leave and go elsewhere. We might not even let you back in.


You weren't responding to the original comment, you were responding to a follow up. You need to be clearer in your points like you are here.

Except they don't in the US and most other civilizations. The Social Contract each individual ascribes to destroys the concept of self ownership.


Except that you can leave the society which restricts you.
The very concept of self-ownership implies a concept of property rights, and if you believe in property rights, what is a country but a group of people exerting a property claim over a certain area. So if you disagree with this property claim, you can leave.
In the state of nature you have control over yourself, but there is nothing preventing me from subjugating you. It is only the society around us which creates the social right of limited self ownership.

@_date: 2015-05-31 18:58:46


The statement you responded to initially did make mention of the US, so your response there and the points you made were confusing because they were made in the wrong context. Ironically, when you clarified, I accepted your clarification and moved on, whereas you have continued in your misunderstanding.


The original statement contained an implied premise. Because not all societies allow you to leave (a society like North Korea clearly exists and does not let its citizens leave), there is no reasonable interpretation of my comment as being applicable universally. I am clearly discussing a society which does allow you to leave, and since we're on an American website, and the other conversant was American, it can be inferred I'm discussing the US. You either accidentally misread it, or are choosing to ignore the implied premise. I've clarified twice for you.
My intended meaning is all that matters. Otherwise you're having a debate about semantics. You misunderstanding a statement does not make the statement wrong. There are different "senses" of words.


If you read back, when I used the phrase "very clearly" it was when I said you responded to a follow up statement which was very clearly only about the US. The follow up statement contained the word "US." That statement was very clearly about the US.
I did not, as you imply here, say the original statement was very clearly about the US. Your reading comprehension is terrible or you are intentionally lying about what I said.
Now let's parse the statement you just brought up. 


The first part is universal. Within a society there is no concept of self-ownership. That applies to all societies except ones which specifically give you self ownership, but then it wouldn't really be a society. There are some logical issues here. I can't really imagine what that society would be.
Now, "You are allowed to leave the society" is applicable to the US and to many other modern societies, including the society the person I was addressing "you" is a participant in (he appears to be American) and "the society" is not all societies but the specific society he is a part of. I doubt he's North Korean. He's allowed to leave whether through renunciation or physically leaving, he can end his association with the particular social contract he is a party to.
You misread it. Deal with it.


No. It isn't. You can leave the US. 


I understand your point. I understood your point the first time you said it. I am going to be repeating myself. You still don't seem to realize that your point that other countries may send you back or fuck with you doesn't make my point wrong. Even if you are returned, you can leave again and go somewhere else. Being returned is not something the US does to you, it is not the society in question which is forcing you back into it but another society/government whatever.
The point is that as long as the society in question allows its members to leave formally or to leave informally and not exert control over them extraterritorially, there is no moral issue with asserting control over individuals inside the society, there is no self-ownership within the society, and the society is in its nature "voluntary."
Get it?


I am repeating myself again. Try to read what I say and consider the possibility that you may be saying things which are not actually counterpoints. I understand many nations do not allow you to become stateless, but they do not impose their laws on you extraterritorially.
For example, one reason the US lets you become stateless is because it imposes its tax policy on its citizens internationally. Physically leaving the US is not sufficient to leave it's sphere of influence. However with most if not all other countries, simply leaving the country in question is sufficient. There are some exceptions of course, but these outliers aren't germane to the conversation because the point is about the ethical and moral basis of the society, and the concept of self-ownership.
Almost all modern, first world countries, like the US are voluntary associations where individuals surrender self-ownership in order to enjoy a variety of benefits. And in my view, there is nothing wrong with this. Deal with it.
If you want to make an argument against that core point, and not some semantic mangling of my words, go for it. Otherwise we're done here.

Actually, I presented two of the common challenges to the case and explained why they were unfounded.
What's far more likely is you can't substantiate your claims and so are therefore choosing to ignore my questions and hand wave your way out of a meaningful discussion while calling the teapot black.


You're repeating a meaningless statement. I find this happens when people can't address the point at hand.


I've followed the case, and pretty much all of my lawyer friends agree that it was a slam dunk and they have no idea what the hell Ulbricht's defense team was thinking.


Well, the difference between the two is light years and usually also involves a different meaning of unfairly. For example, the claim Ulbricht was treated unfairly, or even that drug dealers are treated unfairly by the courts, is very different than the idea that our drug laws are unfair to drug dealers.
You need to articulate specific due process violations which applied to him, or which are frequent in drug cases, and I don't think you or the documentary can do that.


You need to articulate exactly which orders you believe to be unfair or wrong.
Here is the docket:
We can discuss which Judges orders you and others find to be legally incorrect. I can't know what's in your mind, but I've read all of it and I don't see anything glaring or significant.


No it doesn't. It prevents certain evidence from tainting the trial. Having been sentenced to life in prison, there's really nothing a gag order could do to Ulbricht. And I don't even know what gag orders you're talking about.


I already discussed the topic of how the FBI located the servers originally. Is this what you're referring to? You do realize it is not illegal for the FBI to hack international servers, and in fact the FBI has done so before, and seized servers without warrant, and the Courts have upheld the seizure as lawful and denied a 4th Amendment protection because of the international nature. It's why he didn't assert this protection— his lawyers knew it was a dead end and would amount to a tacit admission.
The NSA does have reason to protect the true nature of its capabilities against Tor, and that is reason enough to construct a parallel narrative to be presented in court, which is not in and of itself a violation of due process.
You have to show that somehow a right which would have been protected, was violated. And that's simply not the case here.

@_date: 2015-05-31 22:48:27


Obligation is a weird word to use here. You used it in your initial question, and I think we should stop using it. You'll note my response did not use the word at all, because I'm not talking about obligations.
Please explain what you see as hypocritical and what is unsound. Any claim to any property is forcefully taking something from someone else.
It may be "mean" or "ruthless" or something like that, but its not inherently unsound or hypocritical.


I'm saying there is no obligation on anyone's part. The "obligation" to pay "protection money" or "taxes" is only that they might be beaten up or thrown in jail. It's not an obligation so much as a choice between potential outcomes. You can do whatever you want.
The word is helpful to your argument because it shapes the discussion in an emotional and moral framework which makes people have a certain reaction, but it isn't actually persuasive.


Yes it is, but it was a bit redundant. I could have just said "accept it."


That doesn't mean its not a normal use of the word; this distinction isn't really all that relevant.
We can boil this down to the idea: do we have a right not to be threatened?
In the State of Nature, of course not. We only have a right not to be threatened when we join a society and mutually agree not to threaten each other.


No. It is only extortion, conversion, assault, kidnapping, and murder when a private entity does it. Look at the statutes. These actions are only wrong / bad because the State (society) says they're wrong / bad, so it gets to define when and how these actions are wrong.


Right. That's what I said. That's why you can accept it, fight it, or leave. Those are the three possible paths I can see.
The problem is if you fight the mob or the government, you will likely lose. So people often choose not to fight and instead comply.


Does it speak in terms of morality and societal obligations? I mean, societal obligations in the form of legal requirements sure, and perhaps individual politicians speak in moral terms, but I don't really know that I agree with your premise here. But say it does speak in these terms. So what? The society / State has created the moral framework and societal obligations based on the views of its individual members. The contract we as a group agree to (roughly, the US Constitution plus some common law precedent) creates societal obligations and outlines what in many ways what is moral and immoral behavior for an individual, and then restricts the superior entity (the State) in what it can and cannot do to individuals and the world around it. This is a bit simplistic but it gets the idea across.
I feel like you think this creates a contradiction against something else but I don't see it.
Could you clarify so I can try to understand your opinion better?


I don't feel you made an argument there. You went from A to X without stopping in between. Please clarify.


Hah. It's sadly the opposite.
The "legitimate" authority of a State which allows it's citizens to opt out of the social contract and leave is contained within the idea of "property." (There is an argument to be made which States which do not allow you to opt out don't have a legitimate claim to authority.)
If you can have property, then a group can have property. All a State is, is a group of people exercising a property claim.
My gut is that you think the non-aggression principle can be reconciled with the idea of owning something; but the act of claiming an object as one's property destroys the idea of non-aggression. By claiming something as property, you have aggressed against the rest of the universe by restricting everyone else's natural ability to access and use that object.
This even applies to yourself and your person. By claiming self-ownership, you have aggressed against the universe and opened yourself to retaliation / cannot delegitimize the claims of the State. It is only if you abandon the concept of property, which you can claim a State exercising control is illegitimate, and then you don't have self-ownership anyway. So either, self-ownership in the State of Nature and subordinated self in the State, or, no-self ownership under any conditions.
You need to defeat the argument "if you don't like it, just leave" and ultimately I've never seen a good response to this from any ancap anywhere.
Go for it.

You quoted something from a different statement of mine. That other statement was also in reference to the US, but you do bring up an interesting nuance. US Law applies in some situations to US citizens wherever they are, whereas most countries laws do not apply to their citizens while their citizens are abroad. Therefore, as a citizen of most other countries, you do not need to renounce to effectively "leave."

Why wouldn't you just say: Aaron claimed he was going to analyze the documents to show that climate change studies were often funded by giant energy companies who then benefited from the results, similarly to the study he had performed on Westlaw documents which showed companies benefiting from legal opinions issued by Professors they supported financially?
That's not corruption, let alone a long trail. That's called funded research. It's a well known side effect of the interaction between our capitalist private sector and academia. Furthermore, the research he wanted to do can be done with the documents on the server. There's no reason to surreptitiously duplicate them, and no one is going to kill someone over doing this research because its pretty well known how this works. It's the same as smoking / emphysema research.
The bigger issue for the reasonability of your claim is that the intent of his actions are irrelevant. The violations of the CFAA he was being charged with are strict liability, and the only intent which mattered was the intent to violate the security protocols in place and the restrictions administrators put on him. He would never be allowed to raise the defense of his intent in open court, so there is no reason to kill him to suppress it (even if that insane hypothetical were true).

He was offered a very reasonable plea deal. The jail time he was facing was commensurate with the scale of the crime he committed and the potential damage he could have caused if he hadn't been stopped.
The guy himself was self-aggrandizing and largely unimpressive. Almost every "achievement" is a manipulation of the actual underlying facts, and he possessed generally dangerous and sociopathic views on the value and nature of information in the modern world.

Completely wrong.
Rule 41 was recently changed to allow a Court to grant the FBI a warrant to hack a server anywhere in the world, even outside the local Magistrate's Jurisdiction. This of course only applies if the server's owner or the target of the investigation is known to be an American.
The only reason the FBI applied for a warrant in this case, was because it viewed Microsoft to be an American and have Fourth Amendment rights.
A few years back, when the target was a Russian, the US simply seized the servers in I believe the Ukraine with the cooperation of the local government.
Similarly, the FBI didn't need its own warrant to seize Kim Dotcom's drives, they just needed the New Zealand Police to have one, and then let the FBI copy the data.
While the FBI is asserting they don't need that information to prosecute and won't use it, once he's extradited, there's nothing stopping them from using it in US Courts.
Gary Davis is not an American, and the server was not in America.
There is no exclusionary rule or principle he could exercise to keep the evidence out, because he had no Fourth Amendment rights at the time of the search.
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:46:57
This article is in fact terrible. The FBI had a warrant but Microsoft doesn't think its lawful for the FBI to have a warrant to access the email account of a non-American living in Ireland.
Microsoft will lose because in order to assert some protection from the U.S. government, you have to invoke some sort of citizenship or residence, and proprietary interest in the item being seized, otherwise the FBI doesn't even *need* a warrant to get it. The FBI once seized computers in Russia (or perhaps it was the Ukraine) without a warrant, and used them to convict a foreigner in U.S. Courts. This action was upheld.
So even if Microsoft successfully challenges the warrant, claiming the servers are in Ireland, owned by an Irish company, serving an Irish citizen, it won't impact the FBI's case against Davis, since he's not American and wasn't in the US at the time in question.
Additionally, Microsoft uses peering, so the idea that there was nothing related to this account or emails inside the United States and subject to the United States' jurisdiction is nonsensical.
And finally, Microsoft is a U.S. company. Of course any of its email servers anywhere in the world are subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. Courts. Its a stupid argument to claim otherwise.
The FBI did not over reach. This article is badly written. The only relevance of this fight is one of where jurisdictional boundaries lie and whether U.S. multinationals have to comply with warrants for data held internationally. They don't give a shit about Gary Davis, but they are worried that people will not use their services if they are breaking U.S. law and know their data can be seized by the U.S. Government. Which is a fair concern.

Well, the FBI could then just hack Microsoft Ireland's servers and take whatever they wanted. Sure, Microsoft Ireland could sue the FBI in Irish Court, but for what? Who would they prosecute if they wanted criminal charges?
Microsoft US is claiming its US protections extend to its Irish subsidiary, Microsoft Ireland, but then claims the US jurisdiction doesn't apply to Microsoft Ireland.
You can either have the protections and US jurisdiction, or you don't have the protection and there's no US jurisdiction but which also precludes you from suing the US for fucking your subsidiary over.
Can't have it both ways.

I watched this a while ago. What part of the argument are you trying to articulate? My above statement already included the destruction of this argument but you must not have bothered to understand the ramifications of my second line.
Michael Huemer's assumption that I would agree that he's not justified in going around and locking people up and that you're not obligated to pay at 2:53 is incorrect. His entire argument rests on this assumption, and fails when I simply say, no, of course you or I am allowed / justified / morally able to go around and threaten to lock people up (this is, by the way a key facet of most AnCap thought experiments— they make a reasonable sounding analogy in attempt to get a gut response from people, but the gut response exists only because of the society the already live in. Logically, however, the premises or assumptions are always false.).
In the State of Nature, there is nothing limiting his ability to go around and do whatever he wants.
The concept of the non-aggression principle, the only thing that might allow you to form some sort of moral reaction to his use of force or a threat to imprison you, has already been violated by living in a house in the same neighborhood (really, in general, by existing in the same Universe).
The non-aggression principle only exists in Universes without resource scarcity or localization. Our universe, has both (or at least we perceive it to be constrained by both).
So the act of you existing on Earth at the same time as me, and consuming resources I want, or getting in my sight line, or whatever, has already made you the aggressor toward me. Similarly, I have already aggressed toward you.
That means by default we exist in a hostile state of competition which unless we make mutual agreements not to, I am allowed to do whatever I want to you— including lock you in a basement at point of a gun. It's a matter of self-defense. Without the mutual agreements you cannot be trusted.
So we enter into mutual agreements, roughly, social contracts, in which we agree to mutually respect eachothers "property" and defend eachothers property from others.
That is all a government is, is a bunch of people who have gotten together to defend each others claims.
There is nothing corrupt about that at all, and in fact, one can argue that Statism is the only thing which in fact does respect property rights; because property rights do not and cannot exist absent of a social entity, or other party, which respects them.
If you want self-preservation, and/or property rights, you have to respect and accept the evolution of governments / statism.

How is the logic flawed? 
If they illegally use end-to-end encryption then they have committed a much easier to detect crime prior to the act that they are concealing and which might need to be investigated later.
The intent is also to increase barrier to entry. For example, banning gun ownership, sale, and production would not stop certain criminals from carrying guns, but it does increase the barrier to entry, and you can use heavy penalties to disincentivize further. It's not about stopping it 100% of the time, it's about raising the barrier to entry.
You can make it physically impossible (or nearly physically impossible) to use strong encryption without alerting authorities through requiring all packets to be signed and have a legitimate purpose. Of course you can then resort to steganography, but that raises the barrier back to the level of people using one time pads and other traditional forms of encryption or concealment, which is what the goal is.
The problem is not that it can never happen, it's that it's too easy.
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:46:20


I did read the article. Read my posts.
Your previous post said "end to end encryption whether it's legal or not" and my previous post was discussing the ability of the government to access with a warrant, so it's clear to me we were discussing end to end encryption with the contained implication of backdoor-lessness whether we used the full phrase each time or not. 
I was not initially or primarily discussing the law as outlined, I was discussing the broader concept of using end-to-end encryption in a society that allows access to information with warrants.
See my above post, brackets are used to substitute pronouns since you apparently couldn't follow:


At no point was I discussing whether or not this law was sufficient in my mind, only that it is a positive step because it prevents the sale of products which don't have backdoors for governments.


It increases the barrier to entry as I said above. The bill effectively also bans the likes of Telegram etc... from operating within the UK or being offered on the Apple and Google stores. Meaning one must jailbreak the device, and then install an open source or illegal piece of software. These actions require more technical sophistication, are much more trackable and detectable.
You appear to be focused on the idea that people illegally using backdoorless options would not be made illegal by this bill exposes a flaw in my logic. But you still haven't explained the flaw.
Is the law a complete solution? No, but I also haven't read the text of it. Does it serve a purpose? Yes.

Look, none of this is relevant to the discussion. You need to argue against the fundamental idea of whether or not we as a society have the right to legislate against arguably "victimless" crimes.
I say we do, and I've said why.
I don't really care to discuss the morality of specific laws. If our social standards change in the future, so be it. But Ulbricht broke the laws as they were on the books knowingly, and did so on such a massive scale that he should be in jail for the rest of his life.

Sure you did. First your parents did as proxy prior to age of consent (18). And then when you turned 18 and did not renounce your citizenship, you continued to be a party to the social contract as outlined in the US Constitution.
You are free to go at any point; in fact, we're very generous. We let you leave with 60% of your assets. 


This is 1) incoherent, and 2) irrelevant. You can go wherever you'd like, whenever you'd like. That you choose not to because it is inconvenient to you, or you would rather stay, is your problem, not ours as a society. As to the US and UN being the reason drugs are illegal, that's simply not true; there are many countries with different drug policies, and there are unincorporated islands and parts of Antartica, as well as the Moon, Mars, and the rest of the Universe. The US only exerts dominion over a small portion of the land of the Earth.


You don't know that, and depending upon the drug the risks of you harming others varies.
Again, you need to argue against the fundamental idea of statutes which punish actions which do not have an immediate and apparent victim.
As long as you continue to consent to my 120 mph analogy, your protestations about drug use are irrelevant; it is just a matter of where to draw the line.


This isn't a meaningful point.
You misunderstand the goal of jail within the US. We're not all that worried about preventing recidivism or "fixing" people like other countries, and its less of a problem if people do drugs in jail because they only harm other inmates.


You say it has failed. Others say it has helped the American economy by putting people to work building and running prisons. Our speeding laws aren't particularly effective either, but we're not changing them so that your punishment fits your income, etc...
Whether or not we change our drug laws in the future is irrelevant to the case of Ulbricht and the Silk Road. He will still be guilty because he committed his crime at a time when it was illegal.


Those aren't necessarily goals, particularly of the elite.


Because he aided thousands of acts. If you punish him for a year for each one, he won't get out until sometime around the year 20,000.


Obviously, I see it differently.


Than a drug user, no. Than a drug dealer, depends on the scale of the dealer. Less time than say, a drug kingpin? Absolutely. More time than a corner dealer selling some weed, of course.


No it isn't. We think massive crimes, or committing the same crime numerous times adds up to a greater harm.


I believe there is more to this story.


There is certainly more to this story than what you are saying. If you tell me which case you're referring to we can discuss.


A little known fact in our society is that three people's testimony is basically enough to get you convicted of anything. Hell, you can be convicted of treason by the testimony of two eye-witnesses. It's in the Constitution.
We actually have something called an Alford plea, which allows you to plead guilty without admitting to the crime, knowing that the Prosecutor has enough to convince a jury or judge to convict you. It's rare, but it happens. Fortunately, its easier and easier to have an alibi these days— but no system is perfect.
As to Justice, our legal system is not about justice and never has been. So I don't know why you use that word. It's about enforcing the rules of a system which works, and more or less getting people to believe it is about justice.

Yes, it is less toxic than alcohol, but our society accepts alcohol and its dangers more than it accepts heroin.
All rights are socially derived; so whatever society says, goes.


I wouldn't admit to that. Possession is a crime and I doubt the statue of limitations has lapsed.


Which is irrelevant because society has deemed it illegal. Ulbricht knowingly partook in this trade and risked jail time. If he is true to his ideology he will simply do his time. Arguing about it, or saying he shouldn't be in jail makes no sense. He knew the risks, he got caught.
Real freedom fighters like MLK and Nelson Mandela understood this. You can object to a law, and you can defy a law, but civil disobedience lands you in jail.


Because that is not a desire all of us share. Who cares whether or not people end up in prison for life over the use or sale of drugs? You're arguing a perspective that you need to explain.
What's more important to many is having a structured and functioning society. Many put society over the individual, and we do have a society which allows you to leave, so there's really no argument that gives someone the right to fuck up our society just because they disagree with the rules we've created. Literally, if you don't like it, go somewhere else.
All lines are imaginary and what "we make them." Who cares?


Perhaps the goal is to make it dangerous for those who do use. Perhaps we are targeting certain personality types and traits. Perhaps we are not interested in "saving lives?"


Correct. And it was repealed because the situation became unsustainable. But there has been a long battle. MADD is essentially an extension of the Prohibition movement. A lot of people have had their lives wrecked by alcohol or someone who was an alcoholic and there are in many ways a lot of legitimate reasons for the claim. Entire Islamic nations are dry and have even more absurd penalties for drugs.
But the US had too big of a social drinking component, so it didn't stick. But social drug use outside of marijuana and the elites, isn't there yet, so its not something likely to change. Elites don't get charged.
Remember, there are large issues of socio-economic control at play. You can make arguments for whether they are good or bad, but they're not obviously either.


With the risk of going to jail. What's your point?
Again— you need to argue against the principle of having consented to participating in a society which allows for banning acts through prohibition (malum prohibitum).
All these individual examples are irrelevant. As long as we are allowed as a society to ban acts like speeding which have no direct victim, we can ban other acts which have no direct victim. Or which make "society" the victim.
Whether or not "we should continue a particular ban" is irrelevant to the fact that we have, and that Ulbricht knowingly broke those laws.

He harmed all of society.
Additionally, our society is not structured on finding people guilty for actual harms, but also for potential harms; we have two types of laws: malum in se (bad in fact), and malum prohibitum (bad because prohibited).
There are lots of things that are not necessarily bad in fact, but should be limited for the safety of others; like speeding.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:25:43


It's a false comparison because you limited the domain of "selling drugs" to the essential equivalent of going five miles over the speed limit; going close to the line of what is morally, socially, and legally acceptable.
No one is going to have a gut moral negative response to that, so it appears to potentially defeat my statement.
However, going 120mph through a school zone at 3pm on a tuesday, is clearly something we can sense the moral hazard in. There is not necessarily a victim, but we can understand the wisdom in imposing a restriction through law.
The question then becomes where do we draw that line, not whether we should draw that line or not, and then we see your objection fails if we look at say, shooting heroin.
Since Ulbricht is not charged with just, selling a little weed, or smoking a little weed and staying home, we have the luxury of not even having to entertain the morally grey area. His site sold everything from weed to coke to crystal meth to heroin to weapons, to allegedly, hits.
A true comparison would be the generic: laws against speeding vs. laws against selling drugs (or laws against using drugs, which is cleaner).


Nor does one necessarily endanger anyone else while speeding. One argument (among several) is that one is more likely to; for weed specifically there are a variety of arguments of varying legitimacy, from poor decision making, to it being a gateway drug, to health consequences, to poor job performance, to paranoia, to the negative economic effects hemp has on the cotton industry.
That you specifically do not cause harm is irrelevant; society collectively has decided not to trust you with that decision and legislates against a wide variety of actions on a theory of potential harm. This may change, just as speed limits change, just as prohibition changed, just as sodomy, slavery, etc... have all changed.
But in order to question my argument, you need to question the legitimacy of malum prohibitum as a concept, which libertarians do, not a specific manifestation of the concept.
Many libertarians think that personal sovereignty should trump collective rights, but I tend to think of that as a manifestation of a subjective phenomenology; ie that you are human you think you are important.
I don't believe the individual is sovereign, so I don't share this concern. I am more of a fan of collectivist group rights. When you willingly participate in a democracy in which you have the right to vote, like everyone in the US does, you consent to being governed by the majority except in regard to certain prohibitions outlined in the Constitution (but even those can be modified). You always have the opportunity to leave the society, so there is no moral question of coercion.
Hope this helps.

Society has decided where we draw the line. We can change the line in the future if we like, but you need to convince society of that; and breaking the law the way Ulbricht did is not a good way to do so.
What about say, publicly shooting up or doing a line in front of the Capitol Building. Or having a public smoke-in. Civil disobedience intended to draw attention and change perceptions.
Ulbricht built a platform to capitalize off of the illegality; he also certainly didn't pay his taxes.


This isn't about you specifically. No laws are ever about specific individuals. They're about what society deems likely. Do you think a NASCAR driver likes that he has to go 55 or 65 on a freeway?


Perhaps you're the equivalent of a NASCAR driver. Perhaps you just haven't flamed out and gone into the guardrail yet. Who knows.


It gives the powers that be a way to throw you in jail if you step out of line. It ensures your compliance. General wisdom is if you preach heresy, where a tuxedo. Or, only do one illegal thing at a time. If we know you're a drug user and we can put you in jail for it, then we don't have to worry about other things you might do.


Now you're getting it. But you associated what I think with whether or not these society's and their behaviors were right. And that makes no sense.
Of course I think slavery was wrong, but that's because I come from a society that abhores slavery. Slavery isn't intrinsically right or wrong; its neither. My morality is informed by my subjective perspective, so to me, slavery is wrong. But if I were an Ancient Roman nobleman, I would have no problem with. Were the Romans wrong? That's not for me to say.
I actually don't really have any problem with the conquest of the Native Americans; and it was quite as genocidal as you believe. Most of the Native Americans (9 in 10) died before we really started colonizing. Most cities in the US are where tribes used to live, and settlers found as they moved west that the land was surprisingly easy to work, there were convenient clearings, etc... many of the diseases that ravaged both North and South Native Americans had done there work before we got there— in fact, had we arrived a hundred or so years earlier, we probably would have been rebuffed. Their societies rivaled Europe in population and complexity. It was only because we met a crippled adversary that we won.
Regardless, we come from a culture of conquest; so its a bit ridiculous for me to object to our activities then and be an American Citizen today. We arguably do far worse in the modern world.

If you find an immune system cell that's now a cancer cell, you go in and destroy the cancer cell and fix it. You don't go killing your entire immune system (yes, I get the irony of chemotherapy actually doing this).

What's your point? Society regulates these in a different way.

I'm not sure how that would happen. Cops aren't allowed to use deadly force on people who smoke in public. In my city, its a ticketable violation. Since my society doesn't practice this I don't understand the relevance.


No it doesn't. No one has ever been killed in the US for smoking a joint.


No, because our society does not dictate punishment for those offenses.
This is a bizarre line you went down.
