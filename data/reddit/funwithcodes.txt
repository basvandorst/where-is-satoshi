Here is my TLDR and correction of this article:
  


  
It has been around for very long, though became popular and really dangerous a few years ago on the darknet, when a step by step guide appeared on how to execute this attack correctly.  
My point is: it is not a new type of attack.  
  


  
It is just not true. Multi-sig addresses start with 3, this software's addresses start with 1.  
Also multisig addresses have to be signed by multiple parties, therefore multiple parties have to make mistakes.  
In sum there is almost zero chance to execute this attack against multisig protection.  
  


  
This is exactly how it works.  
  


  
Indeed. It is very easy to remove, the guide explains it well. (Sorry guys I will not share link, though it would be informative.)  
  


  
Nope, that is not true. It uses .NET 3.5, x86 platform, so it attacks Windows XP SP3 and newer versions.  
  


  
There is a huge need indeed. NOD32 is the best chance you have.  
Better, always check about 5 characters in the end of the BTC address you are pasting. Do not check the start of the address, because most people checks it and the software is written to target most people.  
Also the software is not able to nail more than 3-4 characters, or it would take too long. (Not even attempting to do it though.)  
  
In the end the best and only feasible defense will be to make the Bitcoin addresses disappear somehow, hopefully not in a privacy invading mode.
