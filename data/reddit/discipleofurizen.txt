To be fair, you can still spend Rubles on more things than bitcoins right now.

This does indeed happen from time to time, and that makes OP's story the more unbelievable, because it shows that this is not how such issues really get handled by a bank.

What if there are import taxes? Or if something is illegal to import into, our export to, some country?

Have you ever been to a professional conference? Because in my experience walking out on bad presentations is the norm. There are more productive things to do than listen to nonsense, and it's often frowned upon if you start working on your laptop during a talk.

Wouldn't that be "Пожалуйста" instead?

I take it you're not from the government?

The point is, if it happens with bitcoin, it's irreversible.

Did you want to get italics, or were you trying to write \*&lt;...&gt;\*? In the latter case, use backslashes to get asterisks, like this \\\*&lt;...&gt;\\\*.

That depends on the audience. Bashing bad presentation is indeed rather common; if many attendees use twitter, I expect it to happen on twitter, yes.

This is the most retarded thing I've seen on reddit in a long time, and I submitted [this]( yesterday.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:56:40
I think you're right; any idea why? I've never noticed that before, I just now saw it because I was checking if the url was correct.

Why does github even have the option of falsifying history?

Check the username, it's My Little Pony. If that doesn't explain things, you've mist some serious displays of crazy...

Who are 'us' in this case, us or them?
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:49:29
I disagree, this is precisely why they are useful. You hide the safe in a place where a burglar will probably look, and hide you real valuables somewhere they'll probably not look first. A burglar will probably not try to open the safe on location, and therefore not realise it doesn't contain anything interesting.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:06:36
Ah, yes, that makes sense. Glad I don't have twitter.

Sorry for hijacking, just wanted to point out that someone working for satoshilabs (or claiming to, at least) posted a response [here](

You mean like in a pump-and-dump scheme?
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:57:46
Same with 4 and 6. Maybe it tried to say 'then' instead of 'doesn't'? As in "4) Hits 2000, then hits 200."

Whether he is guilty or not, that's for the trial to determine, but it sure as hell looks like he's accused of some crimes.

I suppose this is a rhetorical question?

For My Little Pony here, this *is* what he faps to.

What? You don't really think this, do you?
