Bitcointip owner here. I've extended the time for people to withdraw to August 31.  Not to say that people still shouldn't go ahead and withdraw ASAP, but I was late on getting messages out and want to give people enough time because not everybody checks reddit every week.

Back when fees were smaller it wasn't that big of a deal, but I still think on-chain transactions let bitcointip users do some cool things.  
If you export your bitcointip account's private key through blockchain.info, you can integrate your bitcointip account through your other devices.  So you can use blockchain.info to email you when you get a tip or send a tip, and you can set up mobile notifications so your phone alerts you when you get a tip to your reddit account.  Or you could use another bitcoin client that supports watch only addresses.
You can also back up your wallet, so if reddit or bitcointip or blockchain.info is unavailable to you, you can still load up your private key into another client to access your balance.
Another use case I had thought about is that you could also have some kind of third party program/service to help manage your account for you.  Say there's a bank that let you manage accounts with limits per day or balance maximums.  You could import your private key into that service and set a maximum balance of $10 a day.  Then as you sent and received tips, it would automatically adjust the balance for you by transferring BTC from and to that account.  If you received a tip for $20, it would automatically forward $10 of that to one of your savings account.  If you tipped your whole balance today ($10), tomorrow it would deposit $10 more into that account.  This hasn't come around yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't.

Right.  But with changetip you're not only paying for the micro-ness of transactions, you're paying for the service of resolving social media usernames to bitcoin addresses (effectively).  If the bitcoin network fees change, the fees that services on top of it charge will have to change to stay competitive too.  The only reason the original bot doesn't charge a fee other than the bitcoin network fee is because it runs on donations.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:22:53


I was a bit put off by this at first but then I did the math and found that the fee pays for itself compared to bitcointip.
Say you put in $10, make 10 $1 tips and then every person withdraws their $1.
Let's say 1 bitcoin is $500.
With bitcointip, you would incur a $0.05 fee at every step (1 deposit + 10 tips +10 withdraws) = $0.05 + $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.05 going to miners.
With Changetip, tips are free and only withdraws pay 1%.  (1 deposit + 10 withdraws + 1% of the withdrawn amount) = $0.05 + $0.50 + $0.10 = $0.65.
So it saves $0.40 or about 40% in this case!  The savings are even bigger if a person makes more tips or tips smaller amounts.
For large transfers, payments, storing value, yes of course you'd want to use straight bitcoin, but if you're using it for what it's intended for (tips of tiny to small amounts) then it's better than bitcointip cost wise.
As for the rest... it feels like the ToS was copied and pasted and then edited slightly.  Perhaps can comment on the other points.

That's true, and I agree that people have to be on the offensive to make sure companies take privacy seriously.  I hope they'll listen and edit their policy to address these concerns.  They've been pretty open to feedback.


They didn't pay me off.  Bitcointip on the blockchain has become unworkable.  With rising bitcoin fees, transaction malleability, and forever unconfirmed 1 satoshi spam, tipping more than once within 10 minutes is hard to do reliably and is confusing users.  Rather than go through the mess of converting accounts and rewrite it to some off-chain system, I was looking for a solution to send people to and stop running bitcointip.  Before I heard of Changetip, I was suggesting coinbase's tip thingy for a while until I started running into problems and support would take days to respond.  I think Changetip is one of the best solutions out there right now.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:03:35

Edit: **The offer is closed. I will send the bitcoin back when the participants receive their packages.**
I've created a bitcoin address to send the BTC to if you choose me for the escrow:

[[✔]( **Verified**: [round-peg]( &amp; **&amp; USD** *(2.56 bitcoins)* &amp; [NerdfighterSean](
I'm copying the contract so you can't edit the terms.
**For every 100 upvotes this post receives, I will gift someone a Nexus 5 for a video of them smashing their iPhone**
I will do this for up to 500 upvotes (5 devices).  First-come first-served.
1) The device must be an iPhone 5 or 5S running iOS7.
2) The video must be uploaded to YouTube and be publicly accessible.
3) In the video you must show your face, state your name and why you're smashing your iPhone.  Your reason should include the fact that Apple is anti-bitcoin, not just because you want a free trade for a new phone.  Then load this post and upvote it from the device.  Then smash it.  It must be obviously destroyed beyond repair and function.  Get creative!
4) Post the video link in this thread
Things to consider:
- The Nexus 5 does not work on Verizon, so please check carrier compatibility.  Verizon may not be the only carrier it doesn't work on.
- I'll place the order through Google Play or Amazon, your choice.  Through Google Play you have color options, but it takes 2-3 weeks to ship.  Amazon will ship from a 3rd party provider, but it should ship in 1-2 days.  In either case you may want a plan for the interim.
- You'll need to disclose a shipping address to me at some point, otherwise I won't know where to get it delivered.
- If you smash your phone but haven't actually followed all of the above criteria, it will not count.
Not sure how to prove that I will do this, if anyone has a suggestion please feel free to mention it.
Edit: Videos will be counted in chronological order by when they're posted.  If this somehow happens to take off and you're the sixth person to post your video... I'm sorry.
Edit 2: This probably wasn't the best time to post this since I'm about to go to bed, but I was excited about the idea and I'll be back in the morning!"

Yeah, changetip works on reddit, twitter, github and more in the future.  It also makes tipping cheaper by doing it internally.  With bitcointip, it just works on reddit and every tip is on the blockchain so there are more fees.

Feels like a bummer, but actually is **not**.  The service quickly pays for itself.  Let's say you deposit $10, make 10 $1 tips and everyone withdraws $1.
With bitcointip, that's 1 deposit, 10 tips, and 10 withdraws on the blockchain which is 21*$0.06 = $1.26.
With changetip, that's 1 deposit on the blockchain, 10 free tips off the blockchain, and 10 withdraws that are on the blockchain and cost 1%
11*$0.06 on the blockchain + 1% of $10 withdraw fee = $0.76.
That's roughly a 40% savings after only 10 tips.

Changetip doesn't need any more personal information than bitcointip does.  Like bitcoin itself, it's as private as you make it.  I don't know why they have "name, email address, phone number" in there when they don't even ask you for any of those things.

I'm not sharing anything with them that's not already public with bitcointip, and you don't have to to use it.  It's up to each person to decide what they are comfortable with sharing.  


You still have to pay more than that to get a transaction confirmed in a timely manner because the smart fees haven't been implemented yet.
"It should be noted that this fee reduction only applies to the suggested anti-spam minimums.  The actual fee paid by users is determined by what miners are willing to include in a block.  Reducing the anti-spam minimum fee should increase the chance of a transaction being relayed across the network to various miners.  This does not imply a global network fee reduction.  Transaction fees are and continue to be set by the mining market." - [Jeff Garzik](


None with bitcointip, but it's on the blockchain so the drawback was the threat of seemingly never confirming tips.

Changetip doesn't do any converting, it's all done in bitcoin.  You can display everything in $ if you want, but the values will go up and down as the bitcoin price goes up and down and recalculates how much your bitcoin balance is worth.

The "Karma Exchange" has run out of free bitcoin to give out and could use more.
This might not be the best way to get the most "bang for your bitcoin" because it's already very well known on reddit, but you mentioned bitcointip was a great example so I'm suggesting it. 
I'm open to discussion on tweaking how much each person would get and reddit account qualifications to discourage abuse from people taking more than their fair share if that's a concern.

Interesting idea.  A lot of those people already have things named after them.  Benjamin, Washington, Jackson, etc became the faces of money because they had something to do with the country.  I suggest we limit it to scientists who are computer scientists or cryptographers who had a hand in creating the technology on which bitcoin is based.

Actually for right now, every bittip IS in the blockchain.  This limits how small tips can be and still make sense. 1 millibit is roughly two transactions worth of fees, so it doesn't make much sense to pay a 33% fee on a 1 mBTC tip. Some people do for the novelty I guess.
A layer like you described would make smaller tips much more feasible and will be necessary in the future depending on how the way people use the tip bot, the miner's required transaction fees, and btc value changes over time.

If most miners did this, could you put a "try to undo last transaction" button in a client and it would spend the same inputs but change the outputs to the sender's other new address and pay a slightly higher fee?
Could this be used for security also?  If you have your private keys cloned to a secure server, it could watch the network for spends from those keys.  If you wanted to spend something legitimately, you would just inform the server of your transaction and then it would ignore that transaction when it sees it on the network.  If however, the server sees a transaction that you didn't clear with it first, it could assume your private key has been compromised and then "try to undo" that transaction by spending it to a new address and include a higher fee.
There are probably better ways to do this with multisig transactions, just thinking outloud.
Edit: This is a similar idea to my [chargeback idea]( but this one makes a restriction on time, so it has to be done fast and the cost is greatly reduced.  And it's been shown to work if some miners really are already swapping out early transactions for higher fee double spend transactions.

I was thinking about my reasons some more and realized that most of them can apply to just about any company stock.  I guess it's the decentralized nature of the "bitcoin company" that I think will make it a better oiled machine than others.
And I guess my optimism is just an outlook.  Perhaps you're right that it is a bit premature to call its future a major international currency with any authority.  In terms of long term predictions, I don't know what'll happen or when.  I'd say that $10 a bitcoin makes it a success so far and I can at least see it breaking its previous high in the mid term.

Yes, if you have your private key, you can have access to the same bitcoin address funds from a web wallet, mobile wallet, and desktop client all at the same time.  Be careful though, some wallets will move your funds around to a different address only on that wallet so you won't be able to access it elsewhere again.

Real transactions are because I want the bitcoin addresses to act like debit cards.  If a person exports their private key, they can take it to other services they trust.  They can get tips on reddit, and then spend them from their blockchain.info wallet, or their bitcoin client on their desktop without having interaction with the bot each time they want to move funds to a different interface.


I think the admins are working on comment flair.  This might allow for a little approved icon and amount next to tips.  It's social tipping though, I like to see who has contributed to what.  I think something is needed to prevent fake tips like "+/tip 100 USD" in comments.  
Subreddit mods are free to ban it.  It will still evaluate the tips there, but the bot won't reply.
And tips can be in PMs to the bot as well, so if it's thought of as spammy, the commenter is partly to blame.
@_date: 2012-10-19 17:20:53
The bot is mainly just an interface to the system.  If the bot were banned and all the messages deleted, everyone's information would still exist.  Manually messaging everybody on reddit to try and return their balances would be possible.

Technically not true, because bitcoins will never stop being created.  The reward halves every 4 years, so in 40 years the reward will be halved 10 times. (50 bitcoins)/(2^10) = 0.02441406 bitcoins every 10 minutes. (1283.20299360 new bitcoins mined per year)

If you look at that graph, general interest is at about 35% of what it was at the peak.  However if we look at actual demand of bitcoins by seeing how many are searching for how to buy them, we see a different story.
[Graph Here](
The actual demand for bitcoin worldwide is about 65% of what it was during last year's peak.  I'm guessing that this is because bitcoin is finding it's audience and is growing naturally (and more healthily) from the ground up rather than the top down.

Bitcoin has a number of things going for it that in my eyes, make its success an inevitability.  Bitcoin's incentive structure guarantees its success.  
 
* The earlier you adopt, the more you have to gain.  This ensures that people get into bitcoin sooner rather than later.
* The more bitcoin grows, the more adopters gain.  This ensures that those who hold the currency continually push bitcoin to become more popular and easier to use to increase the value of each bitcoin.
* The early adopters now have power.  With the $30 bubble in 2011, several early adopters now have enough money to put into action plans to push bitcoin to be more popular.  The bubble has also whet their appetite for more and shown them what is possible.
* Most of the early adopters are intelligent.  To be an early adopter, you had to be a nerd, be curious, and understand how everything worked more so than today.
* Those who support bitcoin support freedom and are fighting for it.  They are driven by more than greed, they are fighting a war for financial freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of information.
In a way, the multiple groups and individuals working on the bitcoin protocol, software, hardware, mining, applications, exchanges, payment processors, etc are like a very loose company.  They are all working toward a goal of making bitcoin the best it can be.  You can buy "stock" in this company by buying bitcoin.  Buying bitcoin pushes the value up, which makes all the bitcoins existing more valuable.  The "loosely formed bitcoin company" holds a lot of bitcoins, so your money goes to helping them.  And because you now hold bitcoins, the progress they make trying to make bitcoin more valuable also goes to helping make your bitcoins more valuable as well.
Not sure about how high the price will go, but I do believe it will become a major international currency.

The hackers would have to give a bitcoin address to symantec to send the bitcoins to.  Symantec could then give that address to exchanges or make it public so people could see if any coins they got came from that address and maybe link it to an identity. Blockexplorer could be watched to see when the coins were spent and to what addresses.
@_date: 2012-09-04 05:40:37
They may be implementing it the wrong way, but something very similar to this was discussed in the bitcoin forums.  I believe the idea was that old coins that hadn't been moved in 10 years would be taken from their addresses, and then redistributed to the miners along with the mining rewards and transaction fees.  I think the thread came to the conclusion that it shouldn't be done with bitcoin because it was too big of change in the rules, and it wasn't really necessary.

Anyone know of a chrome add-on to automatically recognize bitcoin addresses in a page and make them clickable?
@_date: 2011-08-25 23:21:07
The addresses aren't linked to each other but are all stored in your wallet.dat.  I think you automatically have 100 addresses/keys generated in advance.  When you use one, that one gets displayed below in the transaction list and the next one in line appears.  That way you have the choice of using that used one again or picking the new one.
The addresses are generated randomly and don't depend on whether anyone else has that address.  Basically, the chances that a duplicate address will be generated is very improbable, but could still happen.
When you generate an address, you also get a key that goes along with that address.  The key is stored in your wallet.dat.  This allows you to access your bitcoins on the network.  The address is like a lock.  When someone sends bitcoins to an address, they lock those bitcoins with that lock.  Only your key can unlock it.  For more information see public key cryptography:

This is a great use for bitcoin.  Crowdsourcing microtransactions and chipping in.

Hi, your balance isn't lost.  If you send a withdraw command to it'll actually still work (**eventually**).  To keep costs down, the bot doesn't monitor messages live anymore, it does them in batches about every couple weeks.
If you haven't already, here's what to do:
To withdraw your entire balance to another address, click the link below, replace "BITCOIN_ADDRESS_TO_SEND_TO_GOES_HERE" with the bitcoin address where you want your balance sent to and send the command to bitcointip:
You can also "export" your private key to a blockchain.info wallet if you wish by clicking this link: 
Several people have done this, and is part of why some people's balances haven't moved.  They are still at the same address, but they don't need bitcointip to access it.

Just thinking out loud here:
A simple two factor authentication app for bitcoin transactions that doesn't rely on a third party service. So if you're making a transaction on your PC, you have to verify it with your phone for it to be valid.  This would ease a lot of fears about security for the average user.
From a user's perspective:
On the PC, in the bitcoin wallet options, there might be a checkbox option that says "Use Two Factor Authentication? [ ]" And then under that "Paired Bitcoin Address: [...                         ] "  a greyed out text box.  When the check box is checked, the Paired Bitcoin Address greyed box becomes white and can be typed into.
Now for the android app.  The user will start up the app, then "Generate New Paired Bitcoin Address".  The App will generate a new bitcoin private key and corresponding address.  The App will then say "Paired Bitcoin Address: 1sasdlkjwerousfdlkjxcvlksjsdfljk"
The user will go back to the bitcoin wallet on their PC and type in the address.  (Or copy and paste it after they email it to themselves or whatever). "Paired Bitcoin Address: [1sasdlkjwerousfdlkjxcvlksjsdfljk] ".
Now when the the wallet generates new bitcoin addresses, it generates a new Address_X like normal, but then creates a 2-of-2 MultiSig address called Address_X+Address_Paired using the address that the user entered in to the paired field in the options.  These Paired addresses will be displayed to the user instead of the regular 1-of-1 addresses that are generated now.
So the user can give out these addresses like normal, but when they try to spend from a multisig address, a QR code with the transaction ID will popup.  Now time for the app again.  The user will open the app and choose "Sign Transaction".  The user will scan the QR code, the app will display the transaction info and then the user will hit a button "Approve Transaction".  The app will sign the transaction with the the private key of the Paired Address that it generated earlier.  Then it will send the transaction to the bitcoin network. Maybe using 
The bitcoin wallet will wait to hear the transaction on the bitcoin network.  When it does, the QR code box will be replaced with "Transaction Signed" or something.
I'm not sure if there's a bitcoin wallet out there that offers this yet, but if you made a simple and secure transaction signing app, any wallet or client could implement it.  The app is the relatively easy part I think.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but
1. The "bitcoins for karma" is limited to 0.01 BTC (~$1).  If I didn't do that, all the reddit power users would swarm it and the fund would be empty.  If I made it more proportional, most people would get about 0 from it. What you saw was the "bitcoins for karma" fund balance which is about $60 at the moment.
2. You were the victim of a scam in The OP input HIS address into the command so you and many other people sent HIM the free bitcoins instead of you putting in your own address. [More info here](  He has since deleted his account.  He only got like $20 worth so I'll try to get everyone their "karma bitcoins" and straighten it out soon.

I still like something similar to the bit idea.  
1 satoshi = 1 bit = 0.00000001 btc
1000 bits = 1 kilobit = 0.00001000 btc
1000 kilobits = 1 megabit = 0.01000000 btc
1000 megabits = 1 gigabit = 10 btc
People are already familiar with the kilo, mega, giga, orders of magnitude from digital storage and bandwidth speed.  The only problem is that people who don't know about bitcoin won't know what a bit means, and people who do know what bitcoin is will confuse bit with bitcoin.  Do we need another name for a "satoshi" or will kilosatoshi and megasatoshi suffice?

Yes, but if your PC is logging everything you do, someone can still use that to get into your account.  With the multisignature bitcoin addresses, the action is broken into two distinct parts.  This way, even if something is logging every action on your PC (or the server gets hacked), it's impossible to steal the money.  If someone steals your phone, it's impossible to steal the money.  Only if both ends (the phone and your PC/the website) are compromised can your funds be stolen.

I've never had problems using it normally either, but I have noticed that when I try to make multiple payments right after the other, the second one can take several minutes before blockchain.info sees it.  
I think this is because bitcoin-qt spends everything each time, so that second transaction would depend on the first and can't properly propagate until the first one does.
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:54:19
Did you know you can export the private key that bitcointip generates for you?  If you ask it to, the bot will give you a blockchain.info wallet preloaded with your bitcointip bitcoin address.  Then you can take your private key and do whatever you want with it.  You could receive tips from other people in a reddit thread, and then spend them from your bitcoin-Qt client or bitcoin mobile wallet app without having to log in to reddit.
This isn't immediately apparent for people who just received a tip, but maybe I should make it more so.

Think of bitcoin transactions like personal checks.  If I give you a check worth $2, and Bob gives you a check worth $3, and then you want to spend $4, you have to use both of those checks to get a total worth at least $4.  So you 'cash in' both of those checks for $5, then you spend the $4 on whatever you were spending it on and then you have to send the other $1 in a check back to yourself, since everything has to be in the form of checks.
I'm guessing the 0.14490001btc was sent back to yourself.  There was no fee included in the transaction.

Kind of a misleading headline but a fascinating concept.  Abstractly, insurance is really just a way to give to charity, while having the amount you pay in give you a contractual good standing when you need help from the 'charity' later.
Right now, a bunch of things are lumped together and you get a few basic plans that aren't very customizable.  With this, you can basically have thousands of very specific Mutual Aid Societies.  Want protection from lung cancer, but don't want smokers to get money that you pay in? There's a plan for that.  Don't want your money to go to anyone over 300 pounds to get protection from heart attacks? There's a plan for that.  Only want your money to go toward other democrats? There's a plan for that.
In regards to the smoking and heart attack examples, this would shift the cost more immediately to the person.  What if the benefits of living healthier could be apparent to the average person today?  In theory, the healthy choices they make would instantly lower the amount they have to pay in. Someone would have to still do all the verification and audit people and their lifestyles, so this won't get rid of all the overhead.  
One potential problem that I can see is these "Mutual Aid Societies" actually morphing into for profit endeavors whose goal isn't to benefit all holders.  For example, care for a smoker who dies from lung cancer actually costs less than someone who dies of old age.  This is because the cost of care during old age is greater than the cost during terminal lung cancer.  This might push these groups to offer something like a discount for smokers instead of non smokers, to encourage unhealthy behavior!
The smoking example was just one that I could think of.  I haven't done the math or researched peercover in depth, so it might not play out like that.

Facebook's IPO raised $16 billion by selling 421,000,000 shares at $38 per share.
There's no company behind Bitcoin to set the price before hand.  Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it had to start from $0.  There are no backroom deals to decide on the price before making it available to everyone.  I think what we are seeing might be likened to a decentralized IPO in real time.
Though this allows for huge gains, it also means we'll likely overshoot the true value, whatever that is, and people will probably call that overshoot a bubble.

It could be done like that, but reddit's API limits requests to 1 every 2 seconds.  I could get around that by using different usernames and even different IPs, but that would be disingenuous.  If reddit found out, bitcointip (and myself) could be banned and that'd end things real quick.

It's not strictly true that the bitcointip server wouldn't run if this improvement hadn't been made, but it sure does help lower the bandwidth used by orders of magnitude!

Have you been offline for a while?  It looks like the tip you got didn't get accepted in time and was returned to the sender after 21 days.
When you tried to move it, you had 0, but now you have a balance from a tip you got in this thread.

An escrow service to make sure that the coins are actually used for what the person says still needs someone to verify it.  Subreddit moderators might be able to do this depending on the subreddit.
But a crowdfunding thing where the tips go through only if a certain amount is pledged is definitely possible and being looked into.

I love all of this channel's videos including this one.  I was surprised to see the "Shut up and take my bitcoins!" pic that I did turn up at [5:29](  You never know where things you throw out there will turn up.

Don't panic!
A fork problem worse than this has already happened in [bitcoin history](


Bitcoin might not have 100% uptime, but it's still got a better record than my bank's website by a longshot.

Yes they do actually.  That's how you can export your bitcointip address to blockchain.info or elsewhere if you want.

Ah, you need to put the recipient before the amount, otherwise it ignores the recipient and thinks you're tipping who you replied to.

I think this one didn't go through because of missing units.

This is the bitcointip bot redeem karma address.  Did you redeem your karma and forget about it?
Did you make your blockchain.info wallet through the bitcointip bot?  If so that would explain why the transaction is already in there.  Your bitcoin address was created when you messaged the bot, then when you export your blockchain.info wallet, the old address is put into a new wallet account (along with all it's transactions).

It changed from 10,000 searches to 20,000 searches though.  I'll be interested to see the search trendline for today when it becomes available in a few days.

Check out:
 
It lets you leave a "bit cookie" string on a forum/irc/message somewhere and then the person redeems it.  I'm not too sure on the specifics, and haven't used it, or seen any cookies in the wild, but it sounds very similar to this.

Lol, I hadn't thought about it like that.

The mention bug is definitely fixed now.  I hate to bug the admins any more than necessary.
