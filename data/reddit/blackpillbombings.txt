Explain in great detail how I failed you have my  full, undivided, undisputed attention.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:42:43
But why? People were stupid before and it went up in 2013.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:20:23
That makes sense.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:14:32
I'd rather have people answer question I asked thanks
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:21:24
You did not answer the question asked.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:57:28
I don't see worship. I asked for logic behind specific theory. How does that equal worship? Please explain in great detail, you have my full, undivided, undisputed attention.

If you think I'm joking just look at the comments in my threads. I've noticed reddit sheeple usually spout instinctive reactions that don't require any additional thought, stuff like:
- [random ad hominem]
- "Why do you need to know this?"
- "They are SHILLS/ SCAMMERS!"
- "Lol nobody can answer this it is all bullshit!"
The above answers make about 90% of comments.
Then about 10% actually put in thought and answer what I asked.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:43:09
Yes, we all know that phrase.
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:34:02
But you did not answer the question asked.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:18:18
Which are actual good projects?
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:48:24
Thanks, good answer.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:20:50
Wrong, that was not the argument. They might have discussed it in one of 1000 videos, but I can't find it now. It isn't based on feelings at all, there was a logical reasoning behind it, but I forgot what it was.
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:36:24


Sorry, I don't see answer here.


I neither agree, nor disagree just point out that you did not answer question.


Where did I say I am worshipping them? I wanted to know logic behind a particular theory. Sounds like projection. Sad you can't understand original question.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:55:55


Actually I think you are wrong here. There are at least 2 people who gave detailed and logical answers to the question that I asked. Here they are:
So messiahsk8er and Manticlops answered this question that you said no one can answer.
Do you stand corrected?
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:12:56
No, wait. My question was to understand the logic behind the claim. Claims for analysts are usually made by logic not feels. So these two people explain the logic behind claims. The question was answered, so why can't you admit that? Ego again?


I never asked about those scenarios. There can be logic behind those as well, but I asked about this particular scenario.

Monero, because you can do fully anonymous ransomware, extortion and drug trade with it, but you don't need to hold it to take advantage of anonymity features, you can always just change BTC into Monero when you need anonymous coin, so it doesn't have to go to moon to be used.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:22:14
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:38:08
But that was not my question.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:21:09
You didn't read my post. Also cool ad hominem and rebuttal of the point.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:49:02
You didn't answer my question though.
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:38:54
not a rebuttal
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:19:36
Excellent answer.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:52:55
Great answer, thank you. One of rare people who just answer the question on reddit.
