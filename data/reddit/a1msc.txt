Is there a specific usecase which the investment will be good for or just expanding their already established business (hardwarewallets)?

Plottwist: he was just kidding and actually doesn't own the address because he never expected to receive anything.

So you are saying I just have to run this command "dir wallet.dat /a/s" for a million bucks right now? *excited*

ELI5: If you sold last week your portfolio is still rising because it propagades back through timespace.

Can someone explain that meme to me? Who is this kid?

Seriously this easily deserves some mainstream media headline ...

The middle one is my iPhone lockscreen background \(the source file from your website\) for the past months, thanks dude! :p

Prepare 20k memes, let's hope we make it until there so we can put in a solid meme support level.

why not just pretend you go to the restroom and then climb out of the window? Don't you do that?

The cryptonewbs that joined 2 months ago going full into alts, then cursing about alts and switch all in into BTC with a high loss and then finally got slaughtered when they went all in into BCH. They never knew better, I'm sorry for them.

the price of gold is not correlated to its usefulness in real products, rather it is agreed upon in a global consensus after years of trading.

Sure you can! While the stated fact is mostly true, there are many considerations completely ignored here.  
Just a brief list of counterarguments:  
\- cryptomining does not actually is there to mine BTC (at some point that even stops!) but to secure the network. It does transfer value. Have they considered the cost of transportation and securing gold?  
\- energy used in Bitcoin mining is usually energy that would else be probably wasted. See Andreas video on this topic: [  
\- The energy consumption per transaction will actually be significantly lowered in the future by scaling solutions like lightning etc.. While the energy consumption will not increase with more transactions!  
\- What is with the energy and human resources that are "wasted" in our current financial system by banks etc.?

In that case you should mine and not sell immediately. Makes no sense to stop mining if you already invested into a rig. (unless you lost hope and stop entirely)

The hot wallet has to be active all the time for withdrawals etc. to function. Therefore the private key has to be exposed on a machine connected to the internet. There are many possible attack scenarios from the outside for this case! (e.g. stealing the key itself, or just tell the machine to send the money where ever)  
I am not saying it was not an inside job, certainly, that might be easier to pull off, but assuming it can't be done from the outside is naive.

on a log scale the same as 25k vs 50k
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:39:51
and if this is an automated process, then this process is just as hackable. It doesn't matter how the machine is connected ...
That's the purpose of a hot wallet ...
