BSAVE.IO is a service you could try. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:01:21
What about shapeshift? It doesn't hold users funds and is Cryptocurrency only.
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:08:30
Sorry about that, I myself was misguided at time of post.

Gyft doesn't have steam wallet cards... The ONLY thing that pisses me off.
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:49:19
I do not have the PhotoShop skillz for it xD
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:07:54
I purchase quite a lot of stuff in amazon, through gyft. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:22:18
Invest in every worthy bitcoin startup, become a bitcoin evangelist. Would give back to the Bitcoin community, and eventually my investments would blossom :)
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:59:11
First one, idk why.  
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:11:15
Yeah that's true, my fault 
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:07:58
Haha lol 
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:01:24
I've never known this. Wow.... Never using BT again.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:49:05
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:58:01
Ahhh okay make sure to go when im in the Philippines again :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:57:49
Ughh, this is so stupid. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:36:30
What happened? Someone fill me in ?
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:07:17
Not interested in purchasing, but perhaps writing an article for a news site I work for? PM me.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:27:08
I was reading over the guidelines and it says minimum tax threshold is if you are under 65 and not blind (that's me) is $6,100 USD. So if I make under that I don't have to file any income tax correct?
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:26:03
You don't consider a 33% drop in value "huge"?
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:25:49
Why is he still allowed to be a mod? Why has he not been marked scammer? 
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:32:55
There's coinbase and moolah if im not mistaken.
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:38:22
I just felt wierd clicking on the link lol. Would stay away from this, little paranoid.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:15:50
Haha yeah xD
@_date: 2014-09-21 02:45:49
The two QR codes are the very end are beginner guides stuff. One is a knowledge base I wrote for bitcoinist and the other is a youtube video. Feel free to PM with suggestions on what I should change.
The speech has to be 4-6 minutes, and 1:30 minutes will be dedicated to a Q&amp;A session. This is for a public speaking class, which I will be giving to some high schoolers. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:42:53
Sent you a PM regarding an interview for an article. Hope to hear from you soon! 
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:29:34
Thanks, opened my eyes. How do you guys think the current investigations of BTC will affect the validity of it?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:13:26
This could be the big boost that BTC needs. One of the wealthiest countries, Dubai, is getting tons of exposure into a new idea. This is great guys!
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:31:21
Nah, too plain for me. Want something original. Something only people that had bitcoin would get. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:40:25
But how you file?
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:49:08
There are plenty of brands, some with working  demos such as alpha t. Also prominent figures seem to be Fibonacci, flower tech, and Zeus miners.
@_date: 2014-06-11 03:01:47
Pm sent :)
@_date: 2014-09-10 02:54:38
Oh nice. Nvm then. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:52:55
Yeah, I know. Wp8 is a great platform, swapping to android though. Until next upgrade, stuck with this. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 03:27:30
Where is Decentralized, Currency located? Its it down by blockchain? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:05:40
The very last slide, links to this. I don't want to do a live demonstration and end up screwing something haha
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:45:20
Such as what? I apologize, wasn't trying to make more money, school was especially boring that day xD
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:59:51
So basically a half of the s2? I don't understand their model labeling... So confusing. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:48:06
Good write up, I don't feel like bitcoin does cause a conflict of interest. I in fact am a journalist (over at bitcoinist), so I can relate. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:47:34
WHAT "SUPERVISED RELEASE"?? This is crap.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:39:51
That's why though. I don't want that xD
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:02:10
Like seriously, the $/gh/s rate absolutely ridiculous. Like better than antminer ridiculous. It's with indiegogo, so there's consumer protection right?
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:53:51
Do you guys mind if I use these responses  in a potential article? Might make something interesting... 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:45:45
Bitcoin hasn't really been a steady upward flow either. But seriously, I rather diversify as I feel safer when I spread the risk.
@_date: 2014-09-16 00:53:45
Thank you for the tips, do you mind if I ask you some things via PM if need be? 
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:00:10
You mean the vaporware by photonic mining?
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:02:32
I'll be watching for it :)
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:58:30
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:57:13
Haha btc for win :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:39:04
Ahh okay, nvm. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:35:23
Okay, got it. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:57:41
In AL, and parents don't want to link credit card to coinbase or bitstamp as they're concerned about heartbleed, bitcoin, etc.... I'm most likely going to use purse.io or someone in BTT
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:33:23
MUST HAVE WHERE BUY
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:05:00
Hey man, I sent you a PM regarding a potential interview. Please get back to me ASAP.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:25:26
If your talking about anycoin, I know Vertcoin implements it. If you meant Bitcoin, idk. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 19:00:40
I'm not, I did know what it was about, asked around and now I do. Just gonna wait it out and  not do it again.
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:38:30
Can someone explain what bitcoin black Friday? Does paying with bitcoin give you exclusive deals? Can someone give an example of some promotions of last years?  
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:11:45
Cinco de mayo...
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:26:05
That's true. But it has to be like that. People with gold, must pay in USD for capital gains. I believe by now some tax accountants must accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:36:55
Will getting hopefully an article soon :)  
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:07:59
Thanks a bunch! Essentially is change.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:01:08
Okay sweet! 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:37:52
Idk, im trying to activate it. How lol 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:06:31
Saw this somewhere : Bitcoin**No restrictions apply 
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:02:13
Be nice if they offered a 5% discount on their own card since they own it xD 
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:19:11
Unfortunately none close to me :/
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:31:45
Haha lol I wish xD
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:27:02
Wait, so this means you got a "Xapo" card in the USA? Thought they weren't shipping in the  US?
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:27:43
"You say tomato I say tomato."I was like why did he repeat tomato twice. Then I was like oh wait xD
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:26:55
Okay, thanks! Will look over there.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:07:45
Of course... I thought it was the huge shift of wall street into bitcoin I keep hearing about.
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:42:16
I do :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:46:52
OH MY SUCH REFERENCE 
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:16:17
Lol, is that what happened? Yacoin isn't a new coin, I've heard of it for a while though...
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:53:08
Yeah, that makes sense. What do you think personally?
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:35:24
Read the comments dude
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:15:51
Thanks helped alot!
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:30:40
Okay thanks! Complaint fixed :)
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:37:12
There was Samsung Toshiba nakamichi Motorola 
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:56:46
The 51% coinotron?
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:33:40
If its in one, why isn't it in all? A per store policy? 
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:05:35
The s2 right?
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:04:47
Okay looked over it. Since mining is like a hobby, what defines the difference between personal and business expenses? I'm assuming anything related with mining is business? Wouldn't that also include electricity?
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:43:04
Shameless plug: Note I do more articles about interviews with companies, community, coins, etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:48:33
IDK, that's all my dad told me. Maybe HE was up $100. Meaning he has 2.5 oz, makes sense. Not trying to spread FUD, just an interesting anecdote you could call it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:07:33
Yup! Just concerned, as blockchain has 12 confirms, I have the bitpay invoice, but I have not gotten an amagi metals confirm email yet.... 
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:16:11
Nice input, do you see this happening in the near future?
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:19:10
Hopefully is .000000000001$ buy all them btc xD. But I seriously think bottom is around $375.
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:26:09
Are these services legit? Leaning towards purse as it seems that it will pop up as like an amazon order, am I correct in saying that?
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:14:24
Lack of change, they are staying stagnant. At least thats what I think. Look at aurora coin, they brought up ALL THE coinmarketcaps as people wanted to get in on what's hot. If we're adopting buisness, spreading the world, btc will grow.
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:33:25
Amagi makes quite a lot off of bitcoin transactions... So that .01% must be alot.
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:26:02
Its one of the designs you can choose from their website. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:59:29
Definitely would, I'd buy a second gpu dedicated to just that.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:51:47
Alrighty, really starting to not want to get into mining as I don't want any legal issue....
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:17:48
Looks super interesting! I'd like to do an interview about it. Am a journalist for bitcoinist. PM me.
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:40:19
Hey, I sent a PM regarding a interview for bitcoinist :) let me know okay?
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:45:56
Do you have evidence to back this?
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:02:25
Ahh okay, thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-03 03:27:56
I thought the receptionist was Satoshi? Did he/she/they get upgraded? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:03:31
What is that? I've heard about it, is it fiat - btc? I was thinking something more along the lines of what you see at Havelock or cryptostocks.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:27:01
USA :)
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:39:51
What,the fuck. Dude why I never get any of this stuff? Imeediatelly putting all buy orders to VOS at a $1.
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:47:29
Ahh kk. Thx.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:20:57
Form factor? S1 style?
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:34:59
But neither are no where near as volatile as bitcoin... And come on. Everything runs off of oil, course its worth it. I do see what you are trying to get at though :)
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:22:37
Great! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:44:04
Or betmoose?
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:26:01
Haha, your funny. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:51:26
I'd still probably use it, not mine it as its convenient as a way to send money instantly around the world for little fees. Also the purchasing power of it wouldn't decrease at governments flip of switch.  
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:05:07
I was just joshing you guys , chilllll. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:30:37
What time frame? Peak of bubble?
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:06:32
That's why I got mine today! 
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:49:33
Would love to do an article of this for bitconist. I'm a journalist for them. Sending pm now.
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:12:43
The IRS did it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:43:46
Is now subject to IRS hmmm?
@_date: 2014-08-04 00:09:48
They do, but id prefer an app. Guess I'll go with Spotify premium. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:47:57
Yeah for real, idk if this is good for btc or bad. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:58:14
Copay and the new armory .92 I believe. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:33:56
"A journalist is a person who works with collecting, writing and distributing news and other current information. A journalist's work is referred to as journalism."I believe im a journalist 
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:23:40
there's a theory that Bitcoin was made by 4 companies. SAmsung TOSHIba NAKAmichi MOTOrola
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:20:43
K thanks man! Hopefully can return the favor if ban gets appealed :)
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:22:40
Think should this clarify something, at least a little bit. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:46:59
Okay thanks man, knew some thing was wrong. Could you ask about me on the forum, I can't post myself :/
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:58:31
Ahh okay thanks. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:27:18
where in manila im assuming this is?
@_date: 2014-05-08 00:27:31
I prefer blockchain, perfect balance security and convenience for me.
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:51:54
Yeah, its like they want something from amazon, and you buy it for them? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:17:12
I would have to lol, who would have known that it would have taken off, and actually been a success story?
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:17:48
Alright thx for help!
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:43:54
Please, I'll save that post and use for future reference :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:26:06
Mine went through... What? I live in Alabama. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:23:00
Okay, thanks for help. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:24:03
I added it in because I thought it looked cool, but I will explain we don't know who he/she is.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:15:26
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:41:30
Filing has to be done differently in assuming. It is indeed relevant. If it wasn't, then why are there legal "age" limits?

I have just recently discovered the great power of south park. I am home.
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:07:01
Here's my article:)
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:46:50
Haven't invested anything.... 
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:09:20
I know right? I'd definitely splurge a little and even buy a 128 gh/s USB stick. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:51:21
It involves "tieing it in with assets". I assume you still have access to the Bitcoin, but they are really holding it in the asset? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:35:06
Idk 
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:50:53
Sure love that you can't read description... 
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:47:04
I heard they would fix coinjoin via ring signatures via the next version of darkened... but hey lets see.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:29:24
Yes it would. Government can't just "demand" bitcoins as its not controlled by them, so they can like repossess it. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:49:33
Wait that's a good idea... Hold that thought.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:41:51
So deposit bitcoin into the Xapo and it'll draw from there whenever? What about PIN code? I can't find it anywhere... Is it the original PIN used to access the Xapo account web? 
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:04:35
Yeah, too excited. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:00:05
That's so great. Hopefully I can eat out soon where btc accepted. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:17:35
NSA honeypot? 
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:59:38
Anyone know why exactly? Its at $450 now. Is it have to do with counterparty and etherum?
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:17:19
What about Expedia? There must be a way to purchase flights, surely not first time. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:53:56
Kk thanks, I'll let my boss know. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:04:53
Sadly, only way I can transact.
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:14:59
Who's down voting all comments lol
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:26:38
I'll try them out, get back to you. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:05:05
Yeah, I'll explain that part. I realize bitcoin has only been out for 5 years, but it still remains accurate as there will only be 21 million coins. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:23:33
No aviator designs? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:32:19
No... Keep them trying to bitcoin mine more altcoins for us xD 
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:51:37
Hey, Justin! Thanks again for giving the time for the article. I hope to work with you guys in the future :) 
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:23:50
Its certainly a hobby that I enjoy :) 
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:53:31
Idk why link is not working, I'll fix it asap! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:22:31
Yeah, got an email. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:34:42
That's how it is right now,  but people have a better chance of getting more than 1 Satoshi an hour. People will be having jobs anyways, so the approach I think we should go is, "hey support this network, and you'll get some passive income by running this machine" you know?
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:35:59
Okay, thanks :) (hope I understood that,correctly) 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:26:12
Counter back, no currency is backed by gold. Thats why they are called fiat. Sure there are gold RESERVES, but were not even sure how much gold we have. If we are backed by gold, you could trade in USD for gold, which ended back on 1971 with the Nixon shock. Hope this helps 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:39:41
It says enter the 16 digit number followed by hash (exact words). So I do that, and it says a bunch of BS I can't here. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:14:53
Its a apple app, called make it rain 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:23:17
YES RON PAUL WILL MINE RPC COIN FOR DAYZ XD. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:56:35
Hi interested in this. Please PM me, perhaps we could do an article? I work for bitcoinist as a journalist.
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:09:28
Yeah man no problem. Its my job :) 
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:00:45
There's a nakomoto foundation if im not mistaken.... 
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:27:31
See you got one too. I think I'll keep mine ip as well, for visibility eh? 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:20:30
I'd diversify. Buying with that kind of cash, I'd go 5% btc, 20% ltc, 25% vertcoin, 5% darkcoin, 10% dogecoin, 5% feathercoin, 5% blackcoin, 5% hirocoin, 5% maxcoin, 5% reddcoin, 5% tips, 5% mintcoin. Going in all in one coin is a bad idea. But the actual though of buying btc, see nothing wrong with it, just make sure to have like 7 paper wallets xD
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:40:31
Another reason I want to go to Georgia tech :) 
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:28:40
Correct, I'll change that ASAP.

They've been banned in several already...what do you think will set it? If USA bans it? Which I know isn't going to happen as new York and California are both strong supporters of this currency..
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:27:30
Ahhh okay
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:04:27
Yeah, activated an email early access trial. You then input information shilling wise. Then I hit order. No payment. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:53:25
I did ask, but thats the problem. I have no clue how to use one of those things with a server psu.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:04:06
Yeah that's true, I see what your getting at. But those lines are what I need to know!
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:04:18
Ahh okay.
@_date: 2014-09-07 19:11:52
I did haha xD
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:46:14
What does this mean for the average miner? Someone please explain? Dad using this as FUD to stop me from mining.... What should I say?
@_date: 2014-08-05 15:06:23
Interesting Xapo is running on the Visa network.... Or just me? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:07:07
See you tmr then Miguel!
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:10:51
okay that makes sense. thanks mate!
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:48:53
It was really funny xD
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:50:25
If interested here are the articles, talking to Miguel now about Coinage.

That one term just made my life soooo much easier. Time to convince my dad that bit coins aren't packets of NSA data lol.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:57:34
Domain for sell. What happened?
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:25:41
Then what's causing the error?
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:34:58
Used to keep up with miner news, but got caught up with other news. It seems just yesterday s2's got released. What are specs of s3"
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:23:22
How does this affect minors? Like myself?
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:40:16
No I don't have any rigs, or ASICs yet. Was considering. Now what?
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:47:26
Thought someone did have a perfect bracket? Was on news couple days ago, but he didn't enter the contest.
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:52:29
Here's an article I did for them :)
@_date: 2014-08-05 15:05:27
Glad they got the fees thing out of the way. Now please ship to US and India :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:04:21
That's why we need a standardized per gh/s or mh/s basis. So they could buy a share offof cloud mining if they wanted to still support it but couldn't afford. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:30:45
Haha seems like the race is on :) 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:07:35
You could use all4btc.com , or a service like that 
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:55:03
You guys don't get it, PURSE.IO DUHHHH 
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:02:19
Sorry if missing something, how is it possible to have $60 in change?
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:40:04
Lol has 2% transaction fee. Rather ironic? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:42:28
I already do that, I sell services as a writer :) 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:17:39
Haha me 2 :), but I think thats true as many countries look up to superpowers like us and china, and if they ban bitcoin, id assume that would follow.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:43:43
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:29:58
Wait so how did you pay? He showed qr code, you had an app to send? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:30:34
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:46:55
So if under $600 no IRS audit?
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:07:54
Just checked gyft, no Pandora. There is Spotify at cryfter. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:06:19
I mean I find this graph a bit misleading, what one bitcoin can get you changes too... Its just that Bitcoin can gain or lose value, and dollar will only lose value due to its inflationary model. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:57:42
Actually in high school honors chemistry, but yeah. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:31:05
Average Joe, somehow introduced to cryptocurrency (I mean property, sorry IRS)
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:48:27
Cold wallets? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:09:29
Well there's the fact that only 1% of GDP of bitcoin has been used for drugs, and 5-7% of USD is used for drugs. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:30:27
Isn't it I can't let you do that? Idk, might be from ERB.
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:59:33
Looking to buy multiple stuff though... What's service fee on all4btc?
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:14:39
Working on an article soon for these guys will post here :)
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:38:11
Got to stick to the classic bitcoin orange :) 
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:12:29
I love what you guys are doing here:) - Nigel from Bitcoinist 
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:44:17
Sent you a PM as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:20:22
I'm not really TJAT concerned about ROI, I just don't want them to be completely useless after the next difficulty increase. Hopefully 3 antminers mining the most profitable sha 256 coin can last long enough to where I can buy a terahash of power xD
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:16:22
Invest into different cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:01:08
What happened? Someone fill me in?
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:45:50
I'd love to write up an article on this. I work for bitcoinist, as a journalist. Could you PM and we could this discuss this in private? I wanted to contact you via email, didn't know if that was the correct method. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:39:05
I saw a post here where Dubai is getting 400 in the following weeks....
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:09:45
No not joking, why would I? Was suggestion . 
@_date: 2014-09-19 00:13:22
 I will now be creating a powerpoint, is anyone interested in going over it?
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:27:00
So I got it to activate, made an account of my choice. How do I add funds to test it out? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:35:23
I think the 35°C max temp will be interesting... Wonder how loud it will be?
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:53:39
I think I found someone on  BTT, but in a couple days would like around $320 worth. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:14:44
Hell yeah it does, $5000 would bring a whole lot of newbs on board.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:44:04
My speech can only be 4-6 minutes, with a minute 30 being Q&amp;A session. What points should I cover? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:10:52
Probably not. They'll probably "lose it" again. Take that back, saw a post of a guy who got his balance updated so hey, you never know.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:36:27
YES NEWEGG ACCEPTS BITCON YES
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:43:24
Thats true. You've got to compare the fees. If PayPal only was 3%, and they offered consumer protection then id probably go with them.
@_date: 2014-09-20 13:41:35
Wow Alice is very sneaky xD 
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:48:44
Yes :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:44:33
Haha thanks eases a lot of worries xD
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:49:06
Did you not read description... I already requested. But thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:19:51
What in specific should I be waiting for to be released from asicminer?
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:31:18
If someone actually get this.... I will rage. Mostly considering that BTC will be worth a lot more in the next couple years.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:31:33
Thanks, just what I needed!!!!
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:00:33
How does this affect minors(not miners)? I'm not 18, so now what?
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:12:58
Let me check my dictionary... XD
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:23:20
I thought in the new core version there would be smart transaction fees, so this is irrelevant? Is that not the case? I'm quite curious also. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:05:21
How was that relevant....
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:00:25
Yeah hopefully! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:09:54
BTC and LTC will peacefully coexist, at least I think so. I think ltc block times are better for real world, but still too slow. Also LTC is better for spending money on every day items as they are around $15 right now, and the most they should ever get IMO is $100. That keeps managing coins down, as saying you spent 1 ltc is easier than saying I spent .025 BTC
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:15:01
Steamgamesbtc is pretty good.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:50:28
I got an early access trial, maybe its of my connections, idk. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:22:49

Me, a side job though. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:54:43
blockchain is pretty good, so is electrum.
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:46:10
My parents did same... Bought darkcoin at $1-$2, told me to sell at $15. Didn't, finally caved in at $11. Here, you've got to trust your gut, mine don't understand HODL.  
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:18:20
Haha I hold, im currently almost at 1st collective BTC. So yeah, I can totally relate to that stages tho :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:36:02
$100 worth 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:30:54
Court ordered a restraining order on there wallets. Read the report, google it.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:14:06
Hey it works doesn't it xD 
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:10:56
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:01:40
Well yeah, im a  bitcoin writer so I know quite a bit about the topic at hand. In fact that's why I chose this topic. I may have one cue card just in case I stumble, but I'll definitely memorize it. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:36:01
Have bday mate:) 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:23:51
Probably is wrong. Seems like a good way to get an audit.
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:03:35
For the non technical people? How is adjusting parameters in bfg/cg miner, setting up the pool info, etc. "easy", let along plug and play? USB miners, usually require either a rasp pi or a computer. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:32:03
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:46:02
I work for bitcoinist, as a journalist. Wanted to know if you had time for an interview. PMing you now. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:09:19
How does this affect the under 18 miners?
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:04:18
The plan b is genius xD  
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:45:18
Hi, I sent you a DM over Twitter please reply to ASAP :) 
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:59:08
For real tho. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:46:58
Im assuming you meant this right?
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:55:04
That's what I thought. Thanks betmoose, hows your company going :) 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:08:39
Make it say the IRS are dumb because btc us not property xD, but seriously, maybe like a myth busting kind of broadcast, where we debunk its not money laundering, its nit a tax evasion scheme, ponzi scheme, etc.
@_date: 2014-09-16 03:12:29
It is, indeed.
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:30:58
Bit too optimistic imo. I'd say something like $720?
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:35:18
How can you invest into said GBTC? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:06:01
Yeah, same. Think I'll change it. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:59:35
Yup for real. That Prism tho. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:30:59
Where was this? I haven't paid anything and it says preordered. Something about confirming shipping address again when it comes sooner to shipping date. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:49:36
I've been seeing a lot of this "GBTC" topic discussed on the Bitcoin channels. I still have no clue what it is. Can someone explain this to me? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:10:46
Why is that name familiar.... He a mod on btt?
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:43:21
Sent you a pm regarding an interview. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:02:26
Yeah, idk. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:37:01
Sent you email regarding an interview opportunity. Get back to me :)
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:18:39
Haha lol xD sorry don't play minecraft 
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:49:20
If you need help spreading the word you accept Bitcoin, im your man. PM me, I'm a journalist for bitcoinist and want to know if you have time for an interview.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:09:02
Haha lol, hopefully can capitalize on some fools. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:26:14
No websites or anything? I wouldn't do that, im not a bad person :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:13:25
Why did you request currency to be USD? Assumptions, my bad. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:35:37
Same amount of coins, but its redistributed among less miners, meaning that same amount of coins are dumped. If anything, it should be less coins are dumped since miners are purportedly getting 20% more coins.  
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:03:25
So these stats show best case scenario, what about worst case? 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:09:51
I seriously doubt it, internet adoptions at 80% and rising according to that chart. What do you think would have to happen for adoption to decrease? I'm thinking net neutrality, but how many "average joes" would really care about that? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:45:18
Working on it. Anyone care to fill me in? PM me. I work for 
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:22:53
I think Coinapult has something like what you are asking for, but not sure. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:25:57
Well they can, its a bit tricky. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:23:54
In my experience for debit cards it's been 1-3 business days. Bank accounts are 3-5 days for me. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:04:06
Was I only one that realised the co-head of technology was named PAUL WALKER? On to things that contribute to the discussion, I think this may be the way how Bitcoin becomes circumvented. Instead of integrating their services into the blockchain, why not make their own? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:43:15
AN thoughts of when this bullish rise will stop?! I sold out at $719, woke up and immediately regretted it. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:12:24
They need to bring buying and selling Bitcoin back. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:28:54
Lol it's not that deep. I entered at $630 so I knew BTC wasn't going to crash like $90 overnight. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:15:21
So um... what now? Do I HAVE to use Coinbase now? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 12:34:00
Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:28:23
Circle. I get the bonus of their price being slightly higher than CMC :)

I'll take a pizza 😂
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:44:03
Fold offers 20% on Starbucks through gift cards and Purse like mentioned before has 20% discounts. How probable is it that you could buy second hand gift cards for 25% less value? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:08:01
Fold seems to not have a limit of volume. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:04:31
I'm considering using this wallet as my main wallet (would be transferring from block chain). How does it compare, if anyone can comment? 
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:38:29
Block trail?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:36:23
How is it any different than composed?
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:55:43
Okay will try that. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 11:53:34
I find automatic text messages when you get a payment or send a payment a godsend though, so I can't switch from block chain (yet) 
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:27:28
Do you know if they are on the available on the east coast?
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:35:46
When will the service come back online? Any ETA?
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:05:34
So why am I still being greeted with a down for maintenance page?
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:47:27
I like Blocktrail :) 
@_date: 2015-11-17 00:03:04
I've got a high 80%+ success rate. Oddly enough a purse instant order didn't ship (3 days stuck on Order accepted) so I cancelled it and just set to a 20% order. Got accepted an hour later, but estimated deliver says 11 days so who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . This is tje first time Purse has does something like this. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:15:35
ABOUT A WEEK AGO

McDonalds is "accepting a new payment method". Take that how you will ;)
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:42:59
I know :p
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:18:15
Can't edit title post realized that after I posted. And correct, I had incorrect usage of vocab on my end. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:41:02
I believe it's only available in the east bay area.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:30:49
Greetings, will most likely pass along this tip to someone that I want to introduce to Bitcoin, or a charity.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:08:17
Yeah maybe going into information security analysts or computer engineers could always be a fun job... Thanks for your help! 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:43:45
Yeah im educating myself on it, I'll be taking business classes might even change my major to business administration. Hopefully get some of that VC $$ that's flowing into BTC right now :) 
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:32:18
So another thread on this sub is I believe advertising the same thing; how will thus be different from Bitmesh?
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:05:42
I was aware of this, and experienced it earlier last week. Guess I will just wait this out. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:37:32
Nope, nothing. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:34:57
Does anyone know if it's anymore secure than a Ledger Nano or HW1? Or is it just convenience and better accessibility? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:38:26
I want to get one, but why are they so expensive? Couldn't you run a rasp pi server, for much less?
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:29:07
Makes sense, but I was thinking more of a brick and mortar bitcoin company rather than a software bitcoin implementation which I think is what you're hinting at. Would you still recommend a CS degree? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:08:12
I'll start up my own node. Any guides on how to?
