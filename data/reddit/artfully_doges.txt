wow, I can't believe that out of 250+ subs you picked that one to mention.  I would think you were trolling me, but I can't believe that you would dig that far back in my history to do so.
Ok, here's my side of the story.  A fellow Shibe noticed [this thread]( on and decided to rally support for her.
I saw his post and thought, "wow, what a great opportunity to promote crypto tipping and help someone out at the same time!" [So I got involved]( in helping to promote and raise funds for her.  I messaged the mods to see if tipping was ok on and got an immediate response saying yes, tipping is allowed.  So we promoted and started a tipping storm and a [giveaway]( thread over there.  Turns out that the mod who gave me the ok for tipping was new and didn't have the backing of the other mods.  The lead mod didn't realize that there was a difference between Dogecoin and Bitcoin so he started [this thread](
It got reposted on and Bitcoiners showed up and decided this was a good platform to explain how much Dogecoin sucks.  Trolls showed up and decided this was a good platform to explain how much all crypto currency sucks.  The mods threw their hands in the air and decided that it was too much hassle to learn about and that they should just focus on helping people.  Hence the compromise of allowing giveaways, but banning tipping as a response to help requests.
The lesson here is that tipping can get unexpectedly complicated really fast.  This one pretty much blew up in our faces and achieve the opposite of what we were hoping.
**tldr;**  The crypto community lost a great opportunity to use tipping to help people by being divided.

Call it what you want, I am a Shibe who's not afraid to join the discussion here.
Dogecoin was my first crypto, and I am still a fan.  I have learned a lot about blockchain technology over the past year or so, and have gotten to a point were I am now comfortable buying bitcoin as well.  These days I am more likely to talk about bitocin than doge and most of my weekly buying has shifted that way as well.  
I do believe in bitcoin, but it has been really hard to get used to how slow and expensive the transactions are.  I can see myself using bitcoin for a lot of things, but I just don't see how it works to buy a stick of gum or send a small tip, or as in the above example to send a 10 cent payment to read a single article.  
Businesses built on micro-transactions could work in this interconnected world, but even a 4 cent fee is too high for that type of transaction.  We still have a long way to go in creating a frictionless exchange to really make it work, but I am confident that will happen and the future will be one of multiple cryptos filling different needs.  I see a diverse ecosystem forming with bitcoin at it's core, and altcoins filling various niches around it.  With diversity comes resilience and stability.  Multiple block-chains means no single point of failure, and further decentralization.  Radical innovation can happen at the fringes, and good ideas can move to the center.  
The same logic applies that drives retailers to build several competing big box stores in the same area.  Even though they are in competition, they know that their combined draw will bring in more people from farther away.  Each store benefits from that by gaining more business than they lose to the competitors.  Altcoins support bitcoin cooperatively in this way, by offering different options and appealing to different demographics.  I believe the net benefit is greater than any potential investments lost to competing coins.

Personally I hold both Bitcoin and Dogecoin and I see a bright future for both.  A future where we buy houses and cars and boats and keep our savings in Bitcoin.  And we buy gum and soda and give tips in Dogecoin.  And we have sweet multicurrency wallets and access to instant decentralized exchange.  (Hey, a Shibe can dream right?)

Seriously, though, Dogecoin has been the best entertainment value I've found in a long, long time.
It has also been a great introduction to crypto currency, and allowed me to learn in a non-threatening environment.  Now I have grown comfortable enough with the use and security of Dogecoin, to start getting into Bitcoin as well.

For the first time in the long history of the world, a device exists for expressing real value from one person directly to another.  A system governed by math in a way that requires no trust in people.  If you have a clever mind for computers you can use bitcoin.  You can speak value with a voice that carries across oceans to every part of the world on a network that cannot be broken.  This opportunity exists for those smart enough and brave enough to take it.

Litecoin was created to be the silver to bitcoin's gold.  It is an experiment at using different parameters for currency issuance.  It was also an attempt to use a more asic resistant algorithm and keep mining on GPU's, though that part has not worked out as hoped.
Dogecoin started as a joke.  A lot of people liked the joke, and thus it survives.  Mostly it is used for micro-transactions and tipping over social media.
Personally I think that these altcoins are a good thing.  I was interested in bitcoin last year.  But at $1100 a coin, I figured I had missed the boat, and was too intimidated to get into it.  Playing with Dogecoin over the last year has given me an opportunity to learn about this technology in a less threatening environment.  Now I feel like I understand enough to secure my coins and have started buying bitcoin as well.  After learning some things, $1200 a coin does not seem too expensive anymore.  These days $350 for 100 Million Satoshis sounds like a fantastic deal.  I don't think I would have put nearly as much effort into learning this if I didn't have some skin in the game, even if it was just Dogecoin.
A lot of people here seem to view alt coins as competition, but I don't think that's the right way to look at it.  Having an ecosystem of different crypto-currencies is a good thing.  It creates a more robust environment as a whole and makes it more difficult for attackers to disrupt adoption through legislation or hacking.  It also creates niche markets where people can have their specific needs met.

Yes, the original Dogecoin Foundation was a loosely organized group of people that held funds for the Jamaican bobsled sponsorship, Doge4water, and other events and helped verify legitimacy for various fundraising efforts.  After some personnel changes, it has been recreated as a registered non-profit.  It took a while to get the bylaws written and everything but it is really officially up and running on version 2.0 and this letter is the first significant act from them.  So far so good.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:58:27
That is correct.  
There are currently over 96 billion dogecoins in circulation and it will hit the softcap of 100 billion early this year.  After that it will change to a static block reward of Ð10,000 per block, (about 1 block per minute forever) which will mean approximately 5.26 billion coins entering the system annually.  
This is an increase of;
* 5.26% for 2015 
* 5% in 2016 
* 4.76% in 2017
* 4.54% in 2018
* 4.35% in 2019
* 4.2% in 2020 and so forth
I think this is a unique and interesting model for issuing currency.  Sustainable growth instead of exponential growth.  Increasing by a fixed number rather than a fixed percentage.  Issued at a scale that works globally.
New coins enter the system forever, replacing lost coins and giving the mining network more than just transaction fees into the far future.  It is built in a way that promotes use as a currency more than use as a store of value.  Encouraging spending in stead of hoarding.
This is why I see bitcoin as a superior option for storing value and acting as the reserve currency while dogecoin finds it's niche in smaller and more immediate transactions like micro-payments, and tipping over social media.

Interesting perspective, but I don't find the arguments they present to be very compelling.  Many assumptions are made, and suggestions are being offered in place of logical arguments (with a fairly insulting tone I might add).
While I can agree that the purpose of any crypto currency is to function as money, I think it is necessary to take it a step further and ask the question "What is money?"  In my estimation money is form of communication.  It is how we express value to each other in a way that words simply cannot.  Hence the expression "put your money where your mouth is."  I think of bitcoin as a language of value.  Just as no one language can express the full range of human experience, I don't believe that one currency will be able to meet the needs of every situation. When you look at it that way, the idea that one language must somehow absorb all the others seems pretty absurd. 
All three of these articles seem to be built on the assumption that this is a zero sum game.  That there can be only one and no other coin can exist along side it.  I find this line of thinking to be very limited and somewhat sad.  I am inclined to go along with Andreas Antonopoulis's assertion that the future will be one in which we see thousands or even millions of different currencies coexist.  Some operating on a protocol level in the background and handled entirely by machines.  Some representing forms of value other than monetary, such as reputation.
Please understand that I mean no disrespect by posting here, I am simply hoping to open up a conversation.  To get people to realize that this is not a zero sum game.  That Dogecoin's existence does not in any way diminish bitcoin, but in fact enhances it.  Like it or not, Dogecoin is here to stay and why not?  It's like a cannon shot across the bow of traditional finance shouting HEY!  The blockchain technology is so good that even a joke can have real value.
edit:  I should probably add that I am not defending every altcoin out there.  Many are outright scams or simply have no good reason to exist.  But some coins will be able to achieve a successful network regardless of how feels about it.

She got scammed out of the coins we tipped her, which sucks.  But I think she did ok with the larger amount that was collected in a wallet address by and given to her later.  She did end up getting a job, so that's the main thing that helped her get on her feet.
I do feel like we played a small role in boosting her confidence to move forward after a failed relationship, so that's nice.  I know that the $100 or so we raised is not going to make or break it for her.  But that is what is all about is helping people out of a tight spot so they can pick up the pieces and take care of themselves.  It was also a tangible way to send the message that you are not alone.
We all need small comforts, so I am ok with the makeup thing.  It may seem petty, but I am confident she made sure her son had food before buying it.  If it boosts her self confidence, then it could really ultimately help her get to a better situation.  
So I guess I wouldn't call the whole thing ruined.  Especially when I look at her comment history and her paying forward lots of small Dogecoin tips and saying positive things about the community.  It was definitely a learning experience for me, and not quite what I expected going in.  But some good came of it anyway.

I would be wary about explaining that it is money.  They could use civil asset forfeiture laws to seize your bitcoin without even charging you with a crime.

It's a legal maneuver that started in the 1980's as tactic to seize property used by drug dealers.  It is a civil lawsuit against the property, not against the person, so it does not depend on any criminal charges being filed.  Basically, if they suspect you are going to buy or transport drugs, they can take your property.  Cash is the most common thing taken, though millions of cars and thousands of houses have been taken and auctioned off as well.  It works a little differently for each locality, but in most municipalities, the department and prosecutors office get to use keep the funds and have almost no oversight on how to use them.

I think that the future will support many different crypto currencies catering to many different uses.  Some will operate on protocol levels and only ever be handled by machines.  Some will denote non-monetary forms of value, such as reputation or popularity.  Some will be a better store of value, while others make more sense for day to day spending. 
I believe that bitcoin will remain king in this space due to network effect and first mover advantage, acting as a kind of reserve currency to the thousands or even millions of niche uses for this technology that form over the next few decades.

It's not a criminal charge, it's a civil lawsuit.

When I first learned about bitcoin, the energy consumption required by the network was a big concern to me.  
But then I asked myself "How much energy is required by the current financial system?" 
What does it take:
* To run the mints and create physical money? 
 
* To move that money back and forth in armored cars?
 
* To keep the secret service moving in their endless fight against counterfeiting?  
* To power ATMs and bank branches?
  
* To power the servers for so many banks, credit card providers and other systems?  
* To power point of sale systems?  
* To build physical bank branches and provide them with lighting, HVAC, alarm systems, and coffee makers?  
* To print checks and deposit slips?  
* To power the vacuum tubes that deliver paper to your running vehicle which you drove across town to deposit that $7.00 birthday check from Aunt Judith?  
All of this for a system that isn't even accessible to the majority of the world's population.
I don't have numbers on all this, but I suspect that bitcoin can provide better security and service more people for less energy.  Financial services are critical systems for human interaction.  If we are ready to start limiting energy consumption, then lets start with non-critical things, like decorative lighting 
It is my hope that by moving to a system that can't be corrupted and manipulated by a small group of people, we will see a bit more fairness, balance, and inclusion in our financial systems.  And since our finances have such a huge influence on the political process, this might just open the door to some sort of meaningful environmental action.  
People do a lot of silly things with electricity.  Bitcoin could potentially move humanity into an era of entirely new and better political options.  So I think it is worth the cost to continue this grand experiment.

**TLDR;  There are a few reasonable explanations of bitcoin processes, but mostly it's FUD and bad info.  IMO the only legit concern in the whole thing is centralization of mining.**
Breakdown of this podcast:  He actually does a pretty decent job of explaining certain bitcoin concepts.  Here are the reasons he thinks it's a bad idea.
Issue  Bitcoin is bad because it is irreversible.  Fraud prevention is harder than fraud correction, so all electronic banking needs to be reversible.
Issue  It takes days to buy bitcoin, because the exchanges need to protect themselves from charge backs.

Think about it this way.  If you had a machine that could generate money, would you rent it out for less than it was capable of producing?
No, no one would do that because that would be crazy.  The conclusion is that anyone who offers you a chance to profit by renting their hash power is lying.

It could be done by issuing tickets in the form of crypto tokens that are secured by the bitcoin blockchain using a platform like counterparty.  All it would take is a well built application that makes it a secure and user friendly experience and a performer who is willing to cut out the middle man and give their fans better value.

Let me give you an analogy.
If America was a boat, the interest on our debt would be like water rushing in from a small hole on the bottom of the boat.  By adding more holes to the bottom of the boat, more water comes in and displaces the water already in the boat thus forcing it up over the side.  The modern economic theory seems to be that if we can just drill enough holes in the boat, eventually all the water will be forced out and we will be floating happily along in a solid and dry boat.

Right now bitcoin offers world class security for a tiny number of transactions.  As use grows, the electricity cost per transaction will shrink.  Granted the network will always require large amounts of power to operate, but I think the potential benefits of this technology outweigh the costs.  
I also think that the energy use of our current financial system is poorly understood.  I expect that if one were to research the true cost of running; the data centers, the point of sale devices, banks and other financial service buildings, armored cars and other security needs, law enforcement and anti-counterfeiting efforts, legislation and regulation and all the other things required by our current way of business, I strongly suspect that blockchain based business will be a more efficient way of doing things.

Ok, I admit it.  This pisses me off...
I just think that people who have taken an oath to uphold the law (along with taxpayer provided salary, benefits, and pension) ought to be held to a higher standard than an ordinary citizen.  I'm tired of seeing it go the other way around.  I support police officers, and am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt most of the time.  But this is an example of two federal officers who blatantly crossed the line and abused their power to enrich themselves while seriously compromising an investigation.  I'd like to see a strong example made here.  Especially after seeing Ross get crucified for setting up an information service that reduced violence in drug trafficking.  By this rational, all the phone providers since the 80's should be charged for any illegal sales made over cell phones and pagers.

Is any business profitable?
If you fully understand the business.  If you crunch the numbers and come up with a plan it is.  If you understand the risks and manage them appropriately then your business will profit.  
On the other hand if you go into business developing a new technology that you don't really understand or have a plan to monetize you will likely lose your investment.
Could be a very valuable learning experience if you don't get hurt too badly, just don't come back here complaining about how you got ripped off on a "sure thing".  The risks are yours to take.  There are fantastic fortunes to be made for those with great vision, discipline, and luck.  And pain for everyone else.
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:04:20
Sounds like too much risk to me.  I wouldn't advise breaking the law.  It is a shame that the laws there are limiting your ability to earn an income and bring wealth into your country in this way.
One possible work around is to have the employer buy discounted Amazon gift cards from purse.io and send you the codes instead of the bitcoin.  Not sure if this would also risk you running afoul of the laws, but at least the person hiring you could pay in bitcoin and you would not have to risk receiving any directly.
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:16:23
Reading this again, I think I get what you are saying better.  If you are looking for a wallet that will allow you to send bitcoin to a phone number instead of an address, I don't know of any.  It's a similar concept if you think of an address as a really long phone number, and using qr codes can make that easier to do, but we are not quite there yet as far as being so user friendly.
Safaricom can do it because they are the cell phone provider.  But personally I'd rather use a little more complicated protocol than to have a cell phone company take over as the national reserve bank and control the money supply.  Safaricom seems like a great company and all, but power tends to corrupt.

Except in your example you would be paying rent, and have a legal expectation of finding your stuff where you left it.  
Cryptsy is not a bank.  They are an exchange.  They are not in the business of storing people's coins.  They do not make any money storing people's coins.  They never once advertised themselves as secure storage.  They never once promised to contact their users at regular intervals about the status of their coins.  They are under no obligation to do work to contact people who abuse their services and take no responsibility for their own coins.
OP chose to use them as a place to store coins, against the advice of the entire crypto-community.  Then he threw a fit and called them thieves because he was slightly inconvenienced. 
Really??  You didn't bother to check on your account for a year?  With all the hacks, and exchanges going down.  With all the problems out there you didn't even log in once for a year??  And now all you have to do is respond to an email in order to restore your account but instead you publically tarnish the company by calling them thieves?

To make an analogy to something you are probably more familiar with, think of m-pesa like long distance telephone service.  You go through a specific company for service and use the application that they provide.  Bitcoin is more like the internet.  An open protocol that anyone can access and build applications for.  There are dozens of different apps that you can use to access the bitcoin network, and new ones are constantly being developed all over the world. 
I like mycelium, but there are plenty of other good choices.

They are all mobile apps.

That seems like they are being totally reasonable.
If you left your bike parked at a hotel for a year, and they took it inside to store it more safely for you.  Then you came back a year later and demanded it back and they said, "We locked it up for you, would you like it back now?"  
Would you publically accuse them of stealing it?  Don't be so dramatic.

People need to pay attention to their own money, and STOP USING EXCHANGES AS STORAGE!!!!
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:35:07
You pay for a safe deposit box, with the understanding that the bank is guaranteeing the security of your valuables.  Cryptsy is not a bank, it is an exchange.  Using them as a place to store coins is foolish.  
No, you don't get access to things you give to another party until they give you access.  That is the very nature of security of any type.  Yes, they want to verify you are who you say you are before giving that access.  Sounds like a very reasonable procedure.

@_date: 2015-03-25 13:30:55
I don't agree.  Offering instant online access to accounts is inherently risky.  An inactive user is unlikely to notice that their account was compromised.  So using an email verification to regain access sounds like a totally reasonable step for them to take.

It is never a good idea to hold coins in an online wallet of any kind.  Best practice is to only have them on an exchange only when actively trading, and move them to more secure wallets as soon as possible.  If you don't hold the private keys, then you don't really own the coins.

People get emotional when money is involved.  Things may not go as smoothly as planned, and people don't always communicate as well as they think they do.  
I stand by my assessment that this has more potential to harm your relationship than to help it.  Maybe you are in the group of exceptionally level headed people who communicate well and have a bond strong enough to survive any perceived offence or accident that could arise from this.  Only time will tell.

Thank you for the explanation, that makes a lot more sense now.  
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:28:57
How long should they be obligated to hold accounts open for inactive users?  1 year?  10 years?  100 years?
How often should they attempt to contact the users?  Annually?  monthly?  Daily?
At what point is it ok for them to consider coins as lost or abandoned?
What responsibility does the user have in contacting them, and checking on their account status?
I agree that the FAQ and other documentation could be better, but that is true for just about every website I have ever used and is no indication of theft.
You say that it is a trivial matter to automate notifications and store coins securely in an online exchange.  I suggest starting your own.

Good point, it would be really risky to try to use random cc numbers while a super computer could crack away on private keys all day for years on end trying to get a match.
My understanding is that there are more potential private keys than grains of sand in the universe.  It would take the best computer in existence today billions of years to get a match this way, and the likely reward would be exponentially less than the energy cost of doing so.

Apple is a company, Bitcoin is a protocol.  Asking this question is exactly like going back to 1997 and asking "AOL or The Internet, who will win?".
Sure one may be a huge company with great marketing and lots of resources, but an open protocol that allows it's users to participate in innovation will always deliver more value than a walled garden.  It may take a bit for that to be obvious, but as soon as someone want's to spend their money in a way that Apple doesn't support, the difference becomes apparent.

I mean open as in open source.  As in any user can view the source code and is welcome to build applications and innovations on the protocol.  
Apple Pay will be easy to accept for any merchant that Apple approves of.  And impossible to connect for any user that Apple decides to ban.  That level of control is not something any person or group of people can have without being corrupted by.
I'm sure that Apple Pay is going to be accepted by a huge number of merchants.  But will it allow you to send money to another user?  Will you be able to use it to buy something at a garage sale or off Craig's List? Will it enable remittance of funds to any place on earth?  Will it allow donations to Wikileaks or other politically questionable organizations?  Will it be accepted at medical marijuana dispensaries, gun shows, pornography vendors or other politically questionable merchants?  Will it be usable by machines and software such as a smart contract or a digital autonomous organization?
Regardless of your personal views on all of these things, it should be obvious that the more universally acceptable payment system is going to be more universally accepted.  
But really it's not a fair comparison.  It's like asking who is going to win between Fed-Ex, and the National Highway System.  I won't be at all surprised to one day see Apple Pay become one of many applications on the Bitcoin network.
