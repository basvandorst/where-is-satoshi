right but its not a good mental shortcut when the government is borrowing money for 0.2% interest rates(with 1.6% inflation) and the government's austerity means a weaker economy instead of less eating out
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:42:59


its actually even more problematic than this.   
[$4.6 trillion dollars of that debt in 2010 was intragovernment debt held by various trusts and agencies]( so the debt held outside the federal government [was only about $9 trillion]( 
Of that \~$9 trillion [an additional $1 trillion was held by the federal reserve]( which while technically not a federal agency pays all interest it earns to the treasury.   
and unlike household debt we were borrowing that money at [extraordinarily low interest rates, around 0.25% in 2010]( for a one year treasury bond.   
[Inflation was 1.6% so investors were actually losing money on these]( but still desired them as a safe asset

It normally does, not right now. Note I’m saying the debt should fall as a percentage of GDP, so if we had a deficit of say 300 billion dollars with 2.5% GDP that would be ok

Rates rise when the economy is good because we make them rise, when the economy is good we should reduce the deficit such that debt is shrinking as a percentage of GDP

this description of the debt is silly, but this is also very incorrect, the deficit is how much debt is added annually, the debt ceiling is how much additional debt can be taken on before Congress must approve more.   
I think where you're getting confused is that Congress has normally already authorized spending and raising the debt ceiling allows the issuing of debt to pay for spending Congress has already ordered. So in a certain sense, it is allocating money congress has already decided to spend, not deciding whether or not to spend money.

but there's really no evidence that people are so incredibly productive that the average worker should be able to pay the cost of a house in cash and can't because of some international banking conspiracy is fucking them

Inflation is good for debtors, bad for people without debt.. I think you're misunderstanding
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:26:31
that would be weak inflation, not deflation

monetary policy isn't counterfeiting or systemic theft...

I'm sure the world will tremble if the $163 billion in circulating bitcoin, most of which is not actively used in transactions for goods or services fails, the 93 trillion in household wealth in the US will simply vanish in terror

austrian economics are not mainstream, and even they don't suggest that if it weren't for evil bankers people could just buy everything without loans. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:28:41
so its not just floating value currencies you don't like, you disagree with all mainstream economics.

right and it can't handle more than 4 transactions per second, compared to visa handling 2000/s on your average tuesday
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:45:41


I can't imagine what you could mean by this... by keynsian economics do you mean floating currencies? Those aren't at all synonymous
you seem to believe that debt is evil and the only reason debt exists is inflation, I'm not sure how to even begin to address your baseless beliefs, how did you come to such strange conclusions?
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:31:59
Nobody is going to want to spend money they think will increase significantly in value, when nobody is spending money prices will be decrease, increasing deflation, lowering consumption.
Deflation is bad

it was in december, in January it was like $20, not sure how it could so rapidly fall to the $0.04 cents the other guy here is claiming unless thats for a couple hours to confirm payment
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:56:59
I'd encourage you to look at Japan and how their 2 decades of deflation went.
It didn't go well

[Visa average transaction cost is ~ 3%]( of your transaction value which [averages out at around $6 per transaction](


[the average BTC transaction fee is ~$30](
Centralized institutions that require permission are totally fine for most consumers, as are transactions have low fees for typical purchase sizes. Now if you're trying to handle an illegal drug transaction of a couple hundred grand, bitcoin is super useful. Fortunately we typically don't design mediums of exchange with drug lords in mind.
the comparison is only valid if there's no way most people could use motorcycles in their present form(or even close to their present form), and people were laughing about motorcycles destroying the bus industry

this seems like a carefully reasoned prediction based off of basically nothing

I feel disarmed by your niceness after my reply. yeah it'll be interesting to see what effects lightning has, definitely BTC seems like a potentially useful currency in countries with unstable currencies and authoritarian regimes. And it can act as a store of value backed by its use there in developed countries- in this way I really see it a lot like gold.
