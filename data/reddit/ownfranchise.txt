HODL= Holding On Despite Logic.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:47:57
You are correct - Bitcoin has lost $200,000,000,000.00 in "Market Cap"  and HODlers and "Investors" wallets are also down $200,000,000,000.00.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:45:56
First off, since your purchase, more Bitcoin has been mined.  So you now own a smaller percentage of the total bitcoin outstanding.  So 1 Bitcoin from five months ago is not equal to 1 Bitcoin today.  Unfortunately, people with your mindset are probably the ones with the most to lose - Stupido.

Still standing by my statement from 13 days ago.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:40:57
The fact that you have to say "who was likely hal" proves my point.  What have you purchased with Crypto?  The vast majority of companies that are accepting it do so as a publicity stunt.  Let's say you owned a Lamborghini dealership and actually accepted Bitcoin.  When someone purchased a car with Crypto, would you keep the Crypto or convert back to fiat as soon as possible to avoid the downside risk of losing your profit or even more?  For instance, lets say you sold a $400k Lambo a month ago with $60k in profit.  You held on to the crypto and instead of being up $60k, you are now down $40k.  I am one who believes big government and big banks have far too much control over our lives and would like to see an alternative succeed but doubt it ever will.  Sure there is value in blockchain but ultimately, the tech is free.  Crypto will be regulated by big governments one way or the other whether users want it to be or not.  I currently have no skin in the game but I made the Ponzi Scheme statement to get people to think.  If it sounds to good to be true...

Bernie Madoff's clients were also HODLers.  The only difference between Madoff and Bitcoin is that Madoff could be held accountable.  Do you think Satoshi will ever see a cell for this Ponzi scheme?  Hell - we don't even know who Satoshi is.  Biggest scam in history!   A *Ponzi scheme* (/ˈpɒnzi/; also a *Ponzi* game) is a fraud *scheme* in which a victim is tricked into investing in a company that does not actually do business, and only generates a return on investment when more marks invest. As a result, when the *scheme* can no longer attract new investors, it dies.

I bought a $13,000 Hybrid car with only 26k miles.  Whenever I find myself spending too much time on this thread  or thinking about investing in Bitcoin, I go out and drive for Lyft.  I earn between $800 and $1300 per week with weekly bonuses and will earn around $40k in profit this year.  After writing off $0.535 per mile, I will have a very small tax bill on that profit.  I work Lyft around my regular work hours (I own and operated an online business as well as a wholesale business).  So by not wasting too much time on this thread, I am turning a $13k investment into $120K over the next three years.  Plus the stress of owning Bitcoin is not taking a toll on my health.  Just some food for thought.

"If the stock market crashes money surely will go in to crypto."  LOL - If the stock market crashes, stock market investors will average cost down just like your "friend" is doing with his crypto.  Or they will go into fixed income with the rising interest rates.  They will see much lower P/E ratios and pick stocks that are a good value.  What is Bitcoins value?  And don't tell me it is in the technology because the technology is free.  The exchanges are prone to hacking and disruption and ever growing government regulation.   While there are some organizations taking it as payment, it is not really viable as it is too volatile.  You can't even tell me who invented bitcoin yet your friend purchased eleven (out of 21 million) for $18,500 each?  And the fundamentals are no different than they were two years ago when each bitcoin was $400.

Before anyone comments, I know Kudlow was wrong about the Great Recession but he is the now the one advising the president.  In Bitcoins future I see more regulation, more transparency and more government control, which is the exact opposite of what bitcoin was supposed to be.  That doesn't mean you can't make money trading it.  If you can make 10-12% on each trade, you will double your money every 7 trades or so.

I truly hope I'm wrong but it looks like we are prepping for war with Russia. I believe those that are not supporting the President in this action are being removed. I also believe Trump's steel tariffs are not about jobs but about having enough production in house to support our military in a war. I think Putin is getting ready to move against the rest of the Ukraine. Plus Russia has already positioned itself so they are one of the top suppliers of energy to the EU.  Think about some of the anti-Russian news we are being fed: 1) they interfered in our elections, 2) they took over Crimea, 3) they used nerve agent in the UK and then warned the UK not to mess with a nuclear power, 4) they threatened to attack US forces in Syria, 5) they are working to get rid of the petrodollar (and are accumulating more gold than ever) and today the news is that 6) they are attacking our power grid.  Of course, Trump needs wartime consiglieres and he already picked Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson.  If he chooses John Bolton as the national security adviser, I will be convinced that war is inevitable.

Unphased - This is my first post as well and I want to give you some advice.  Find something you like to do and instead of gambling with your hard earned money, invest it in your business.  I started a small business with just $256.  I found something I thought might be a good seller and then went on ebay, Amazon and other sites to see how these items sell.  I then used the $256 to buy a small amount of these items.  They sold out in a week and I knew I had something.  I did not quit my job but continued working as I built my business.  I hit $100k in sales after three years and now 7 years after I started, I average between $175k and $200k per year.  I am the only "employee" and the business has decent profit margins.  There are no guarantees in life but you can do research that will better your chances of success (in my case it was seeing what kind of volume others are achieving, what keywords they were using, which products sold best for them and what types of advertisements worked for them).  I do not rest on my laurels and am constantly working to grow my business.  I also pick up some rideshare gigs when not working the business.  I play with crypto for fun but will never "invest" in anything more than I would in a night at a casino.  There are too many unknowns for me.  I would rather trade within a range for a 10-25% profit.  You only need to be successful a few times to double your money.  But the money you put in should be play money.  One country puts restrictions on crypto and the whole market falls 20%.  Another exchange goes down and who knows where it goes.  You say you are highly educated - use that to your advantage.  And definitely do not discount the value of hard work, even if it means multiple jobs.  My grandfather came to this country WITHOUT an education.  He served in WWII and came back to New York and took a low level job in the transit system.  He then took on a second full time job as a porter in a NYC hotel.  While he was away from home alot, he was soon able to buy a house in NY and to eventually retire comfortably.  He is now gone but his old home recently sold for $750,000.  It can be done but you need to put in the time and make sacrifices.  Whether you take my advice or not, I hope you find the success you are seeking.

You should hope so - that way you can get out at 50K.  But even if we do get there, you'll probably HODL and ride it all the way back down (as will many others).  In my opinion, HODL = Holding On Despite Logic.  Personally, I think those "idiots" will get a chance to buy back in at $5K, not $50K.  Bitcoin will never be adopted as currency on a wide scale.  The governments of the world will not allow it.  It is too volatile to use as currency and even President Trump's new Director of the National Economic Council, said, "Bitcoin is not real money."  So what is the technology worth?  Let's be aggressive and say $10,000,000,000.00 (actually blockchain is free but we will ignore that for the sake of argument).  So that would put the bitcoin price in the $800 range.  And once 21 million Bitcoin are mined, the value would be $476 (where it was not all that long ago) based upon a $10 Billion valuation.  But I am open to other viewpoints and would love for someone to explain to me why bitcoin should be worth more than $10 Billion, let alone the $140 Billion we see today.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:06:26
admyral - I agree with you but Bitcoin is not that.  Governments are already controlling the exchanges, taxation and bitcoin uses already.  They also control electricity and can shut down the entire network anytime they want.  I see nothing wrong with trading but I am not a HODLer and do not believe the false promises being offered by bitcoin.  Heck - we don't really know who created Bitcoin.  It may even be those corrupt governments you speak about.  Think about it, who would benefit most from an untraceable "coin" that could be used for payoffs or even to finance one of those wars you mentioned?

So you've been a Redditor for 7 months - congratulations.  I know this because I went back to one of your posts from 7 months ago where someone called you out for being a Redditor for 4 days.  I'd like to know how you went from being an expert on Game of Thrones, which you apparently love commenting on it, to an expert on Bitcoin.  Believe it or not, it is possible to understand the tech while disagreeing with a valuation in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  For me, the fundamentals of Bitcoin are no different than they were two years ago when it was valued at $400.  If anything, the fundamentals are worse with things moving towards regulation.  At this point, I believe understanding technical analysis puts you in a better position to make money than crossing your fingers and HODLing.  But good luck to you.

Was Binance hacked?

The fundamentals haven't changed in two years since it was in the $400 range.

That eliminates 17% of the world from buying cryptocurrency  through their institutions.  I am sure more will follow.

Thanks for making me piss myself.  Now I need a quilt incontinence pad (QIP for short).

Bitcoin already saw its ATH.

HODLers prefer to stand under a tree during a lightening storm.

In a few years, they will have a special on the biggest Ponzi scam in history.

The term moon recently switched from an astronomical body to getting caught with your pants down.

I am totally ready to buy 1 BTC for 100,000 Pennies.

They did not give it up.  They just got scammed into buying high and are now illiquid or too scared to buy.  When well known top holders are telling you that Bitcoin is going to 100k or 1 million each, they create a FOMO.  This is no better than a Ponzi scheme.  In just the last month, Bitcoin is down more than 40%.  There were so many sell signals all the way down from the top but FOMO turned these fools into HODLers.  HODL in my opinion is Holding On Despite Logic.  The exchanges are prone to hacking, scams abound, no regulation=no recourse, the blockchain technology is free, it is too volatile to be used on a wide scale and yet people pay $6800, $10,000, $15,000, $19,000 and more for one coin out of 21 million.  It is a shame because I believe most of those that bought at the higher prices did not have the money to lose.

Yep, with plenty of opportunities (and signs) to get out.

At least until the lights go out.  Or you can't log in to your account.  Or you can't withdraw from your account.  My money in the bank increased slightly over the past 30 days while Bitcoin is down 40%.  I am not a proponent of the banks but I do not believe Bitcoin will be the solution.

It's only about $3 billion in U.S. imports - not overly significant.  That being said, there are plenty of other things that will be driving the stock market lower.
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:31:26
Forget $4000.  I plan on buying in the $400's.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:53:09
Never again.

These are times when "smart" people realize how dumb and unworldly they really are.
