Excellent by Andreas. Haven't watched many new presentations by him, but great to see he is still nailing them like this.

It doesn't matter how many copies there are of bitcoin. Some will become valuable for other reasons Bitcoin can't fufill, but Bitcoin is and will be valuable because many people hold it and also because many bussinesses will build on top of it. The more a network / system is used the more valuable it will be. The longer bitcoin is around the more trusted it is for its security, liquidity, store of value, and if lightening becomes a success it will be trusted for quick, fast and easy smaller payments. Of course becoming more stable is a much needed feature too, but if bitcoin gets  to trillions of dollars market cap, we will see much less volatility. But also before then you have much more volatile currencies around the world, so it will become appealing to them people, especially those who's banks do not serve them well. You also have bussiness that will use it as a backend payment system, so people that use apps like Abra's to send money back home from a different country will not necessarily know they are using bitcoin to send money. I believe at some point we could see many banking apps around the world using bitcoin as like the TCP/IP to transfer money from one person to the next, even if they are using a different bank from a different country. True, there is always a chance another one takes the crown, but it is not an easy crown to take. Even a far superior system that doesn't use a blockchain and has built in scalability would take a long time to become the number one crypto, because it requires years of trust.
