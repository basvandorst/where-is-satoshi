There is no information at risk in a public transaction. In fact, transactions are broadcast to everyone on the network.

Bluetooth is effectively read only, and the only data exchanged in a transaction is public by design. Its entirely a safe channel.

When QR codes are created, the requested amount is included in the scan. No one types in bitcoins manually.

The value was already priced in on the rumor, and people sold for the gain on the news. This is how the stock market has always worked; rewarding the company is not directly proportional, it's about correctly estimating value and making a profit.

Overcomplicated and too expensive. Drop GSM, fingerprint scanner, and the camera. Move all that complexity to a smartphone app. 
Not only are smartphones faster, but they have a better interface than a card-sized clunker. It's not a feature to drop a smartphone. This was product appears to be designed by an MBA.

I don't trust phones, too complex and insecure. Rooting phones can only happen by abusing flaws in the kernel - anyone can include rooting code in their applications.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:20:10
How does the module know that what it is signing isn't due to an attack on the phone itself? These hardware wallet need screens of their own, with hardware and software too simple to be evil.

What if the GSM network asks you to sign something that you don't want to?
@_date: 2015-05-08 02:30:30
We get it, let's get big blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:02:09
The only exploitable thing is private key operations - so confirm what you are signing in the secure computer.
Phones do EVERYTHING else, they don't need to be trusted, they don't need to be secure.
In this device, they replaced the phone with an expensive GSM connection and proprietary hosting of third party keys. I'd rather have my phone.

Let's try again with all the computing power on Earth at the moment. And let's say that we can generate and check a private key with a single instruction.
 says the total performance is 309 Pflop/s.
2^128 / (309 * 10^15) = 1.1 * 10^21
This is 2531 times the current age of the universe. A full private key is 2^128 times stronger.

The Executive Order states that no notice is necessary prior to seizure of assets, due to contemporary systems for transferring wealth immediately. Thanks, Satoshi.

The seed acts like a copy of your safe full of bitcoin. You can create the safe again, anywhere.
Lock your phone and lock Mycelium with a pincode - they won't be able to take your bitcoin even if your phone is taken. You will be able to recover your bitcoin even if your phone is thrown to the depths of the ocean, using your seed.

A private key is 256 bits, so to brute force 128-bits, let's say you spend $1/hour on AWS for GPU instances (four instances of $0.2665 per hour for 32 virtual processors and 4x1536 CUDA cores).
Let's estimate sky-high that this platform with 6272 processors could check a candidate private key in ~200 instructions, and runs at 3 GHz. (ECC scalar multiplication, 3 SHA-256, 1 RIPEMD-160, and some conversions). (3 GHz * 6272 processors) / 200 instructions = 94 billion keys per second.
2^128 / (94 * 10^9) = 3.6 * 10^27 seconds
This is 8.4 billion times the current age of the universe.

Basically, computers are not instantaneous, and this allows them to mine something valuable in the time it takes to assemble and distribute a full block header to hash.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:04:07
It's fastest to send out an empty block to the slave miners until a full block can be assembled. The current block requires the last hash, so as soon as they have a hash they pop it in and ask everyone to mine it then return to build a full block. There is nothing to see here except misunderstanding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:50:42
This happens when hashes are found randomly early. It's luck.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:03:27
These empty blocks are found within seconds of another block. Its just the name of the game, get off your high horse telling other people what to do.

Bitcoin is the great orchestra of computing. It combines so many solved problems (peer to peer networks, hashing, public key crypto, etc) to solve the greatest inefficiency in modern times. Last December I read about it, but didn't grasp it. Now I'm prepared to join my peers and move on from traditional banking. Good to be here!

Because the longest block chain on the network becomes the source of truth.

Tor, gnutella, any p2p network. They have to block all traffic, delete all records of the bitcoin block chain, etc.

The hash rate and value will always be infinitely far from infinity.

You'd make more Bitcoins by buying them instead of paying for electricity to mine.
