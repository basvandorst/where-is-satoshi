Brick and mortar mainly. I’m trying to convince some of my local stores to start accepting bitcoin. Convenience stores, barbers and pizza shops, that kind of thing.

That is exactly what I’m planning to do in my local area. I’m just thinking it all through at the moment. I’m setting up a BTCPay server on Monday.

Great. That’s a really useful post. Saved.

I’m answering my own question now. 
New BTCPay directory launched today.

Both spendabit and coinmap.org look ok. Thanks. I even found a bookshop near me that I didn’t know took bitcoin.

I like this. I think I’ll just start asking ‘Do you take bitcoin’ each time I’m buying something everywhere. It’s unlikely they will say yes to start with but it will get them thinking. 
Next time the price has a good run up I’ll start promising to spend a lot if the start accepting ฿itcoin.

Maybe‘investing’ was the wrong word to use. My point was that moving from one currency to another doesn’t necessarily mean a loss of value, like buying food and then eating it. 
If the things that you invest in are then expended, good luck to you buddy.

You are ‘investing’ in crypto/bitcoin not ‘spending’.  You don’t *spend* USD to buy GBP for example, you *convert* USD into GBP.  You haven’t lost anything until the prices move relatively to each other.

Ha ha

That’s what I’m doing with this post. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:43:11
Yer that was pretty much it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:36:43
Well spotted. I’ll fix that. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:16:02
Genius. That sir is the winner. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:27:49
Wow they look great and what a cool idea. I’d love to sell them, that’s exactly the sort of thing I’m looking for.

I will be making my own products. I also want to sell other items. 
Thanks for the advice though.
