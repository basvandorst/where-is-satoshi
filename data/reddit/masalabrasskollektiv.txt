“An antithesis to the traditional village brass band: mobile big band, caravan of dilettantes with a touch of insanity”: that is how the Masala Brass Kollektiv regards itself! 
The open collective (anyone can join!) of up to 25 musicians can be seen on streets, in squares and on stage both in Austria and abroad since 2007. With a repertoire of upbeat music in a wide range of styles, we can be seen in concert, at parties, festivals, weddings, and have even appeared in film and television productions. In 2012 we held Austria’s first street band festival Skappa’nabanda! in our hometown of Graz.

Could be a nice tool, but registration and starting process is too complicated. Maybe they should enable the users to link to their google+ account in addition.
And: The app still crashes by tapping through menu...

Thx for that link, we should try it.

We would be happy about sending a few albums in the wide world of Bitcoin users at Bitcoin Black Friday. I want to convince my band mates of the comfortable use of Bitcoin for our online shop. Thx for your support... ;)
The Masala Brass Kollektiv is an Austrian Alternative Brass Band. Our repertoire consists largely of original compositions and self-arranged cover versions ranging from alternative rock, Balkan beat, klezmer, funk, jazz and reggae to all conceivable – and occasionally unlikely – crossovers of these genres. Being mobile and unplugged, we are an all-terrain band that loves to mingle with and engage the dancing crowd.
