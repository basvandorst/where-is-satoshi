Relax. My comment is based on a random article from business insider.

The only criticism I have of this guy is that he eats shitty food every single day. He must have some amazing genetics to still be living.

Is this in Turkey?

So wait...the government will control the dispensary in it's entirety? That's a bit crazy.

The thing is that these aren't actually weed stocks, but more so to do with grow operations geared at weed. A real weed stock would be to get a share of a company that actually sells weed.

That's weird. I was in Toronto last week for a couple days and the place was filled with tons of dispensaries and delivery services (for members). Honestly i was under the impression that it was legal, but you need to get licensing from the government similar to alcohol. I just looked it up and it's officially legalized in July of 2018. I really hate when the government puts people in the grey zone of the law.

My mistake, I thought they were american companies that are selling the suppliers only. As Cannabis is still illegal in the US (FED) it would be strange to see it on the stock exchange. I mean it's mission to use a CC at a dispensary at the moment.

There is something that is not likable about the guy. Even if he had nothing to do with crypto and i met him somewhere, he gives off a weird vibe.

Do both. Hold some for gains, and spend some bit for online purchases. The issue with spending Bitcoin in the US is that we have to log everything and pay gains even when we spend crypto if USD to crypto price changed at the time.
