Right, it's basically, instead of knowing that a key sent coins exactly at block t, you have to assume the coins could have been sent at any time for the rest of the blockchain (Probably you could trivially implement a rule to do something like substitute rings for coinjoin after coins are N blocks old, but I don't know if that's presently worth it - edit: maybe that is not so trivial, if you want to prune the entire utxo set actually, requires a bit further thought)

Why not ring Ct? ;)

yeah- I haven't switched the demo code yet.. The probability should be 1/8 (in one of Bernstein's papers he talks about the set of valid keys for ed25519 which are taken as multiples of 8 iirc)

Indeed, thanks.

I see. I hadn't really heard of them, but they scored ok on Charity Navigator. Thanks for the input. Do you have any specific dirt on why they a might be a scam?

I think that if you combine CT with Cryptonote, you lose the ability to send coins without the receiver knowing which participant of the ring signature sent them.

Good post, will have to read later.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:22:33
Fair enough.

Any opinion on United Way or the water project?
@_date: 2015-06-15 04:38:09
overstock is based out of Utah near salt lake city I think?

This looks very interesting thx

correlation is not causation, there could be quite a few other reasons the node count had fallen off..

I love reading explanations like this. Thanks.

Do you / anyone who has one know if shift keeps track of the tax stuff in a convenient manner for the user?
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:38:37
Have used it a few times, and it works great.

Hi, 
This function in Mininero will do it for you 
(It's been a while since I implemented it so pm me if have questions). 
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:38:17
it's a browser app: 
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:28:16
I will definitely try it out. I actually posted this morning about how I wished my local coffee shop took bitcoin for tips.
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:31:22
Same, this was great! [coffee with fold app](

I've only skimmed it, but I think that the whole "proof" / "lemma" format should be taken out of the write-up if it's an inhererently trusty scheme.
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:03:09
In fact just today, I was working at a cafe and made two .005 bitcoin transactions over the internet which were pretty much instant using coinbase. These could have easily been tips. Of course something like bitpay could be used since baristas probably want fiat.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:25:34
Thanks! I'm planning to go try it out this afternoon.
