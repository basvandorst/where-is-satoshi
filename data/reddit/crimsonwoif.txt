I wish they would allow custom fees.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:27:28
Thats what exactly happened to me. I paid a low fee a week ago and it finally got confirmed after 4 days to which the merchant canceled my order because the price fluctation had changed the price.

Verification is a bitch

I got a raspberry pi I can use to run a node.
Besides an external harddrive and port forwarding port 8333, do I need anything else?
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:22:52
Another one down! More exchanges to come.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:13:40
Can you please add Digital Bitbox as a Hardware Wallet without Segwit so more people will ask them to implement segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:02:45
I paid half that fee with segwit and its been [4 days since this transaction has been unconfirmed.](
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:38:14
PUSH FOR SEGWIT! 
I want the fees to be less than a dollar again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:34:37
Share this more please!

I love AirVPN, can't wait to renew my subscription!
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:44:45
Never invest more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:06:49
Sorry I don't want to pay a $17 fee for a transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:08:33
Approximately how many transactions need to be using Segwit so that fees will become $2?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:54:03
Gemini has no roadmap for Segwit, it really need a good push.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:15:13
Moved to Gemini and I never looked back.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:01:22
Customer Support is good, they usually respond within a day. The setup isn't hard at all, they have their own client called Eddie and/or they let you make an openvpn config file so you can use it with openvpn.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:35:37
The payment processor asked me for my address to pay back and they took money that I paid them for the fee.
I really wish the lightening network comes out soon and everyone starts switching to segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:58:37
Where do I click fees?
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:40:42
Oh wow thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:16:10
Gemini's support is nonexistent.

You can get paid in bitcoin with bitwage
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:52:59
I'm waiting for the Digital Bitbox, a hardware wallet, to implement Segwit for cheaper fees.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:50:00
The future of Bitcoin is so bright!

Registration doesn't work.

$60 fee lol
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:56:25
Could you tell me some?

History in the making! Where's my SpaceX suit because the prices will be skyrocketing to the moon!

I've been wondering why there has been no shitposting on bitcoin black friday.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:46:07
Well it's still over 9000
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:27:00
Why not use Trezor as a cold storage?
Also, what iOS wallets?
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:17:48
It will still work. Hypothetically, if the company went bankrupt, you could still have your bitcoin on the device, its just that the software won't be updated for new upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol or for software/security upgrades.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:14:59
I look at the first part and last part of the address 5 times and the middle part only once.
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:46:33
But how can you trust the VPS provider then?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:13:38
This is sign by the Bitcoin Gods to buy now!
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:34:58
To the moon now
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:36:51
Stick to Purse.io
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:47:00
ProtonVPN or AirVPN seem good to me
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:17:13
Too late, I already setup my new home on the moon.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:24:32
Its so sad they discontinued the classic usb.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:46:25
See you soon!

I've played through all three games. I don't remember this scene.

Looking back at all, how would you go about securing Mt. Gox further more?
