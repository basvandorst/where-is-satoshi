Make sure it's 23 BTC and not mBTC. If it's 23 BTC, delete this post as soon as you can.

The OP obviously doesnt know since they randomly found some and is asking us for basic advice.

2 5970s. I guess it isn't as bad as I thought. But still around $5k in my pocket.

I guess I have no idea what it would've been back then. But the exact same rig is currently doing ~1Ghashs right now. 
EDIT: I've upgraded the RAM to 8GB but that doesn't really effect mining

Better to end up on top without any debt whatsoever than speculate and maybe make it big time or you could lose it all and saw what if.

I would've sold at $100 if I just would've freaking mined in 2011 like I thought.

I'm just saying, ISU definitely feels smaller than 30,000. I see the same people all the time at buildings I shouldn't even be in. Or parties.
