The US federal government just want to be able to trace every bitcoin transaction, it has little to do with the ETF applications. There are already ETF products available in other countries.

Not so obvious to many!
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:32:00
Either that or it is a massive bull flag. What do you think?

Some sellers on there don't mark up at all. I don't know why they don't want to make any profit. Perhaps they are money laundering.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:23:51
Yes I'm going back to using LBC now because the trades happen much faster on there.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:26:26
I've done it many times no problems.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:39:04
Care to explain the difference please?
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:10:05
Whereabouts are you based? A very large city? I'm not seeing any trades at all near me. I think LBC is going to be the best option if nothing else is available.

My friends are starting to say they are sick of hearing about it, but they will regret it when 1 btc = $1 M!!

The BlackRock news today has given bitcoin a boost, and the imminent ETF if approved by the SEC on 10th August could lead to the bitcoin price going to the moon (in my opinion).
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:35:46
This is my analysis of why the bitcoin price is going up at the moment (news related as well as chart related) and my prediction of what will happen next.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:47:33
I agree with you but don't you take profits at the peaks?
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:17:40
What do you think is more accurate?

Good advice, unfortunately these scammers use every known psychological principle to convince people that it's all genuine. Literally thousands of people a day are being scammed out of their cash.

Awesome thanks for the reply!

The email demands $1,900 in bitcoin, otherwise they will send a video of yourself masturbating while watching porn to nine of your contacts. It is a bluff and can safely be ignored, but many are still paying the ransom.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:38:34
Brilliant thanks for sharing that.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:08:00
Good idea, in fact I made a video about that. Look for the one I did on what needs to happen before there will be mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:00:08
I made this video for friends who were asking me how to trade bitcoin. I made it as easy to follow and hopefully foolproof. Let me know what you think?
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:07:07
So much bullish news at the moment, I would be surprised if the bitcoin price does not shoot up again soon. What do you think?

He is the co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Avenue Capital Group and the co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.

This is my latest chart analysis and thoughts about the fundamentals of bitcoin. What do you think? Is it too late to get involved now, or never too late to join the bitcoin party?
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:57:19
That's good advice, indeed the price has increased by ten times in the recent 2 years.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:07:54
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:38:56
Me neither which is why I'm making these videos. Unfortunately it isn't making much of an impact as thousands of people a day are still falling for it.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:06:51
It seems that any positive news story is increasing the price in the last day or two, with a massive green candle appearing seconds ago!
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:17:29
Good tactic.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:07:07
Lots of news for you in this video including the headline that Billionaire Marc Lasry is predicting that the bitcoin price could rise to $40,000. Wouldn't that be nice?
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:47:46
Lol I wish you every success.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:15:50
Facebook and Tesla share prices have dropped a lot in wake of bad news from the companies, whereas investment in Bitcoin Futures has gone up considerably. Are investors switching from tech stocks to cryptos?
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:48:16
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:47:12
I agree with you. Some people are not convinced still.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:15:56
Yes I think so. Look at what people were saying at other times that it crashed.
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:04:19
Imagine the fees!
