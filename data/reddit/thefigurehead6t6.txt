There is another way.. Give a redeemable receipt kinda token and make them come back in 10 mins to allow a couple confirmations. Then redeem it at atm and get the withdraw.

How do you get coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:24:48
Thank you for the insight. I have a normal coinbase account but don't think I can pay with my bank account yet as it needed that international payment confirmation shit or something

Without the efforts of the devs making cryptocurrency payment cards and banks the only option to pay for things would be sending payments to addresses.. Can you really see a supermarket full of people buying everything that way? I can't.

Well try use one the bills he ripped up and glued together mate... Oh and he also filmed himself doing it too just incase they needed evidence.
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:45:59
You have to buy it with fiat tho or? Kinda ironic.
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:45:32
I mean it's all well and good having crypto but in the future if the real banks were gone how would you spend any of it without a cryptocurrency bank?

So someone watching sports games is fine? Someone reading books is fine? Dude get a grip. Everything you do in life is a waste of time, it's called living. We fortunately get to choose how we waste our time and some people like to be engaged with something interactive.

How is btc talking to the dead? ☹️
@_date: 2018-08-20 09:39:27
Why would people do it on a old machine tho? It would all be done on newer machines and drive the difficulty up making using "old" machines pointless and profitless.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:08:28
His outright dismissal of alt coins coexisting seems pretty closed minded. Its bitcoin or nothing for him? Why cant they coexist?... I mean they already do so whats his point? When bitcoin goes up other cryptos go up and vise versa
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:44:29
Lol huge if we are judging by the difference between buying and selling prices
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:30:33
It's strange though because most ATM's are free in the UK. It's usually only small businesses that have ATM's that charge here. Do most charge in the US or something?
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:26:10
I'd understand a few wallets but that many is almost increasing your chance of losing bitcoin surely.
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:18:02
I'm not talking about ones at my bank being free. About 90%+ are free everywhere I've been in the UK. Gas stations, most shops etc. I'm asking about the USA's situation because it not that common to be charged anymore in the UK for using them.

Maybe malaysian. A lot of muslims there.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:23:14
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:25:35
It's a pretty bad point coz u don't walk into gas station and put money on your bank cards so why would u "recharge" a bitcoin card.. 
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:01:01
Bitcoin doing all the hardwork, shitcoins doing nothing? haha
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:15:11
My ATMS only allow money to come out... with exception to the machines INSIDE the banks.

Also washed his feet in toilets... And actually gave himself that cancer with his diet.
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:38:32
feeling or showing an envious resentment of someone or their achievements, possessions, or perceived advantages.
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:45:05
And also jealousy. Some people see the gains its made, decide its too late for them to get any and try to bring it down instead.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:28:22
That just proves my point no? Jealousy has more meanings than envy, it is not solely about fear. I get your original point and all but its a little pedantic with the meanings lol
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:35:03
I mean, USA was making a bomb selling vehicles and weaponry to the allies so I could see it helping a bit.

He made a series of bad choices that lead to his death lol probably starting with his diet...
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:14:04
I use debit cards but I cant put money on them in a gas station is my point? Our bank machines inside the banks only just got the deposit ability like within the last 2-3 years... lol
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:08:32
Must be an american thing? Never heard of it in the UK

It's set at a time it didn't exist
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:52:51
No hes saying whatever the cost of electricity is will get you more btc than mining it would so then it would be worth even more in the future... The whole "it will be worth more in future" argument is null and void when buying more of it now rather than mining less for same price will net you more btc in the future also...
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:13:39
It would be almost $1k atm.
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:07:26
The point is going right over your head man.. lol Whatever your electricity costs - buy that in btc instead = higher amount of bitcoin.. Now AND in the future...
@_date: 2019-12-20 01:29:54
Can still work out with you spending more on electricity than you would have on just heating if your electricity prices are shit like mine are. I was mining for a loss for a while before I turned it off because of the coin values dropping so hard. And I also wouldn't have the heating on anyway most of the time even at winter so it doesn't really save money on heating it is just an extra cost. Andddd you still have to heat your water and probably have some sort of heating on a timer anyway to save damage to piping.

Except that none of it is "the process". He's just randomly holding his stylus up against his finished piece and just happens to have the markets on his screen in an attempt to seem artistic.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:38:37
Where does it imply that? It's a meme... It's meant to be someone with bitcoin looking back at everyone else being left behind...
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:43:19
Is it really profit though? I used to mine and had to stop due to it just not making any money at all when the coins all dropped. All depends on your electricity costs.
@_date: 2019-04-19 12:05:05
Begging for donations under the pretense of showing us something plainly obvious was do-able.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:50:58
Let me just hold the stylus there so it looks like they caught me in the act of drawing... I did cringe fairplay lol
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:50:00
Yea this is a bit too posey for my tastes lol..

This whole image is computerized right? The entire room looks fake as well as the canvas.

Yup everyone likes to have an excuse
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:51:13
Wow that guy really missed the point with his pen argument lol... That pen isn't worth 1k because no one is willing to buy it for 1k. Nothing like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:25:06
Imagine if they used that money to buy btc.. The long con lol

Go to the doctors about your concussion

I think he means he works with her and she mines. Not that she mines at work.
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:20:03
Yes that's what people say in the UK. You go to the doctors. It's short for the doctors' surgery.. You know the place that invented the language you are typing? Yeah that's what we say here. "I need to go to the doctors'". Sure you can say, "I need to see a GP" etc too.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:43:05
Every time I ever got other cryptos instead of bitcoin, I usually lost money in the end. Only exception was Ethereum Classic and Litecoin. For everything else, I should have just got BTC because usually BTC kept going up and they were not following and often going down.
Not to say the past will always repeat itself but meh you do you man. I still kinda think Ethereum Classic is cheap enough that it could experience a big growth but who knows.
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:36:13
Please stop it's embarrassing
