1024 bits for creativity @_date: 2015-06-10 00:53:51
That's what i've been doing for years. Even though i lost $10k in half a year(dont ask how its shameful) with bitcoin, i still use it to buy things online, tip people through social media, and even got some of my friends to buy at least 1. Also, i convinced my dad to accept btc at his restaurant in nyc at one point. I want to do more but i know a tech like this doesnt need help to get to the masses, it will just happen.
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:48:45
Stealth addresses were so last year!
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:05:19
You can, but you will not make a prophet. You will create a lot of heat and spend a bit of electricty, so besides the learning experience, its rather pointless. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:36:43
Isnt that just beautiful? If only we could use this blockchain for a plethora of other uses that require user authentication. Website login? Physical lock-Door entry? Car entry? And so on and so on... Its possible to use the blockchain for everday auth-related uses without ever having to use real world user information to "unlock" the lock. Think how safe that is compared to legacy systems that encrouch on privacy just to buy a loaf of bread with your cc. Bakery CC list gets hacked? Your fucked. Bakery bitcoin list gets hacked? Bitcoin users not affected. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:25:22
im confused... how does this work again? whats stopping the same person asking from different addresses? 
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:10:46
Excuse my ignorance please, but just curious, why are they so bad again? I know they lost some funds of their customers just recently, but i believe they got reimbursed. Besides a couple bumps in the road, why are they hated so much on this sub. They created one of the earliest btc wallets with much improvmenta over the years, you cant expect a new startup working on a new technology to produce code that doesnt glitch up once in a while. Idk i use their app on iOs and never had a problem really. Just genuinly curious, did i miss something ?
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:52:53
Good one.
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:06:32

I dont get why selling bitcoin to your "friend" means that you are a money transmitter. If i want to sell you WoW gold for bitcoin, how does that make me a money transmitter? The regulations for exchanging goods/services for goods/services is rediculous. The U.S gov't is incredibly overreaching when it comes to financial freedom.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:18:29
Calm down dude the sky isnt falling. You want to use the old chain that isnt scaled then be my guest but im pretty sure you'll be the only one using it thus making your coins worthless. Would you rather be with the majority or against it?

Hmm So my choices are Ponzi Or Pyramid scheme you say?
Neh, i'll go with the choice that makes most sense. It's a revolutionary new technology that cuts middlemen, cuts costs, has 100+ uses other than currency and eliminates the need for trust. Yea i'll go with that one.

@_date: 2014-12-07 06:31:13
Very interesting concept indeed. I have a couple more questions if you don't mind me bugging you. Will the "shard size" and "redundancy" be adjustable? Like for example if i choose to pay a higher fee to break my file up into even smaller sizes and have them spread across even more Hard drives, is this possible with storj?
Also who holds the keys to the encrypted files? How is encryption dealt with at both ends? Is is simply a matter of password protection or is this something the network manages automatically using hash signatures? Is there any backup/failsafe should the user forget the password? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:53:17
That sure is an answer for the truth @_date: 2014-12-09 05:45:32
Its real. its called reacting to a (growing) threat. This is one of many tools (they) have. Don't be so quick to dismiss this as paranoia. Trolls are gowing in numbers on these subs, and you can easily see it in the number of subscribed users and the ones that are online trolling. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:16:37
not at the moment the investigation is ongoing and mediation talks are on monday. im jus hoping i can recover some losses from all this, its been a fucking nightmare

@_date: 2014-07-11 21:25:02
i concur, its so easy to spend btc, but at the same time its hard not to hoard. simply because us true believers know its full potential. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:57:55
Tipping celebrities and influential people on their twitter feed/FB is the best way to make changetip go viral. Imagine all the bitcoin noobs who've never even heard of bitcoin. 
I say by christmas bitcoin will be a household name. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:36:14
I have nunchuck skills. jk. I would say im good with computers- i'm tech savvy. I can build custom PCs, diagnose them, fix them etc. I do have some C++ knowledge and networking skills but never exactly finished college... But honestly at this point, im willing to do just about anything for a job so it doesnt have to be computer related. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:25:14
When you import private keys into electrum, they arent tied to the seed, so if your computer just broke and your restoring your seed, the private key you just imported will not be included in the seed and hence lost your funds assuming you no longer have that pvt key. 
did a message not show up when you attempted to import? usually does...
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:05:39
I've been using startpage since i heard about Bitcoin.

Thats very interesting, this whole time my understanding of entanglement was that one particle being modified instantly affects the other. Thank you for that.
But, i dont like using the word impossible. Maybe FLT communication/travel is possible but not in the sense we can imagine, yet. I like keeping an open mind on these sort of things.
@_date: 2014-08-01 06:11:30
yes increase node discovery range to w.e u like. look up the command im sure its out there somewhere. anyway why would u wanna dl a full node? just dl armory or electrum, they make it easier to understand wallets and how they work...
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:07:12
uhh yea whats going on ?
@_date: 2014-08-15 02:57:38

Bitcoin will replace banks by 2015. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:38:13
do i have to ask the obvious ?
@_date: 2014-06-28 05:59:25
how is that any different than tipping in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:28:28
"The more recently the coins have been moved, the less a fee is needed"
This is actually the opposite. The "older" the coins (less they've been moved), the higher priority and thus a lower chance a fee is required to propagate the transaction to the network, Albeit it much slower than if a fee were added.
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:15:34
and i wasnt warned by hundreds of people from reddit, i wish i was i would have bought btc and hodl. i didnt even consider signing up to reddit till jus a few months ago. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:39:20
Indeed bitcoin falls under all that you mention, and more i would say. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 07:31:38
Good point. So, what else are we missing? I believe the transactions per second have to scale up to a magnitude of 7/s. And if i'm not mistaken the network is only capable of only 2/s. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:42:33
You have just given me incentive to setup changetip. Thank you kind sir, the love will soon be spread.

so your saying because im a random person my advice is invalid? even if i got fucked up the ass by a mining company and was in OP's shoes 6 months ago and dropped 6K on a rig. your saying i dont know wtf im talking about? your saying if I had gotten that advice, my 6K back in october wouldnt have become 60K 2 months later in december when the value rose to 1200? Your saying i shouldnt have bought BTC at the time but instead get ripped off by a mining company that delivered late and costs me shitload of money? ok if thats what your saying then your absolutely right. OP please buy a rig and get ripped off and waste your money. there best advice given 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:40:25
dang it why didnt i think of that
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:38:59
my thoughts exactly. The ideal thing would be for them to agree to a parallel bitcoin economy that way they could use it for everything and bypass having to cash out to fiat altogether. But that's being way too optimistic. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:50:08
Id like to know that as well.

they have no incentive to stay in a pool thats been known to double spend. simple logic. why associate yourself with an immoral agent that's proven to be less than genuine in the past. miners dont make up an equal across the board share of the mining pool, some hold majority rule over others, those that know that it would be in their best interest to align with a pool that has a clean an honest history know better than to bother with a pool thats been known to double spend. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:51:44
what did they say exactly? 
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:22:05
This is a concept based off of Maidsafe, and another project which i cannot recall atm, they work as a decentralized storage network. How is this any different? Unless im missing something?
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:47:24
Of course they have to associate bitcoin with pedophilia and the black market. Good job Dick Wolf. Well... at least CC was thrown in there too.

good job, a biscotti for you @_date: 2014-10-30 02:50:35
nice! my thoughts exactly. I mean, why would bitcoin be replaced when it can simply be improved upon? any major changes that require an upgrade to better the system in anyway or fix some unforeseen glitch can simply be applied to the software itself. And it's in everyones best interest to switch to this new version or they would simply be ignored by the main chain.
Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:10:09
This is spot on. I've been warning people about this for years. No one will listen. This man speaks the truth. Something is coming soon in the form of a "false flag" and it will usher in the floodgates. It will fool the already gullible public into accepting more unjust laws targeting our civil liberties and restrict our financial freedoms. 9/11 is just a tip of the conpiracy iceberg. The rabbit hole goes deeper than most are willing to believe.
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:59:54
The facts are all our there, i don't have to cite them just cause people are too lazy to do their own research. I am helping people help themselves. The rest is up to them.

Interesting take on it, thanks for that. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:31:16
Thanks i'll try that... I wasn't given any offers to begin with. I simply cant find a job, but i figure since im posting here i might as well ask to be paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-31 03:27:18
It's finite in its upper limit, not lower. ie. There can never be more than 21 million, but you can always divide a coin in half- infinitely, which theoretically should be infinite. I hope that makes sense? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:33:44

Im sorry but Cointerra is far worse than KNC + BFL Combined. We not only got our machines months late, but we didnt get the machines we paid for. NOT to mention the machines are almost always faulty, or completely made of shit. 
Late delivery + Underperformance(+more energy consumption) + 2 RMA's = yep you guessed, BROKE.
BTW Cointerra is being sued in a class action in the states of California and New York. If you purchased your miner before November 1 and reside in these states. Contact me so I can have my attorney get in touch with you.

The limited speed of light is only applicable in general relativity. Quantum theory allows for quantum entanglement of any pair of particles anywhere in the known universe. What you do to one bound particle is done to another, no matter where that particle may be. This phenomenon(proven) can be taken advantage of to allow data to be sent and receieved anywhere in the universe. Also we have wormholes (theoretical but likely) which can fold spacetime and create a shortcut to get around the lightspeed barrier. The "cosmological constant" as einstein put it is looking more like a fallacy everday.

I find that hard to believe. A society can function without money. Maybe not this society in its current state but i do see a future where money becomes obsolete and the driving force for innovation and creativity isnt a piece of paper with dead presidents on them but rather recognition and remembrance. Granted, We're a long long way from that and im not one to conjecture how a society without money would look like. But this isn't a utopia im describing its an inevitibility of technology. 
Also why am i being downvoted for calling money evil? Is that such a difficult concept to accept? Cue cliche: Money is the Root of all evil.

i never claimed every event was a false flag, im merely suggesting those events were MOST LIKELY ones. its not unheard of that the U.S regularly carries out these ops to suit their interests... look at the FFs in the past that were now proven to be true (golf of tonkin, 9/11, operation northwoods(fail), boston bombings, sandy hook) and yes they were false flags im not going into another debate with you whether they are or not because that would reduce me down to your level. So i suggest you do the proper research and come to your own conclusion or just stfu about providing evidence for someone i could give 2 shits about. i formed my opinions over years, throwing a link your way isnt going shatter your paradigm overnight. can you say cognitive dissonance ?
The American media outlets are all owned by no more than 4 major corporations. they own every channel you watch and spoon feed you shit daily. whether through news or entertainment. So, yes i would def say they ARE COMPLICIT in perpetuating lies and propagandizing you and your fellow sheep. "pointless and insane crimes" are relative especially when your talking about super powers. dont give me that shit. And i am not praising Iran and Russia, apparently you didnt get the jist of my post. i was merely pointing out facts... where in that post do u see me praise any nation? 
" it's not revolutionary to support a Free Palestine."
wtf are you talking about? oh god, i give up... 
but seriously... the dollar collapse may not be "imminent" but it is definitely inevitable. fiat currencies have a very short life span.

Congrats, you are now part of the 99% of bitcoiners who are exactly in line with that rationale. 
To think these regulators have the audacity to require such invasive measures just to prevent money laundering and "terrorism" is at most laughable, not to mention demonstrates their lack of knowledge on bitcoin and why it was created in the first place. 
If they push bitcoin back into the dark, it will flourish there even better than before,  while still seaping its way through main street. These will be interesting times.

I know what you are refering to, it was an exploit that had something to do with javascript, and the NSA knew of this exploit. But, That doesnt mean that the entire tor network is compromised.

OpenBazaar is truly a game changer, especially if its userbase and merchantbase expand rapidly and its network effect is significant. I dont think many people realize the implications of such a system. Connecting any merchant to any customer anywhere in the world without an intermediary or middleman to oversee that exchange, while being immune to shutdown and all external threats is beyond disruptive. Should such an experiment succeed, I think this will be the straw that will break the camels back-- decentralized data transfer(Bittorrent) + decentralized Blockchain(Bitcoin) + decentralized marketplace(OB) + decentralized data storage(Storj) + decentralized internet(MaidSafe) = The establishment FED up.

The NDAA and Partriot act are laws that make any "suspected terrorist" an automatic enemy of the state, whether a U.S citizen or not makes no difference- and all they need to do is "suspect" someone of being a terrorist. 
If you think the IRS cant sieze your assets and freeze your accounts simply by suspicion of money laundering then you have no idea of the laws set in place by people that want you to pay a tax for every breath you take.
Theres no more freedom here, financial freedom and our civil liberties are fading away every day.

im suing because i paid for a product that i expected to receive at a certain time and that i assumed was BRAND NEW. I did do the math, and the math showed me that i would break even with that product in 1 month had they actually delivered on time. how was i to know they would deliver late especially when their whole motto was "we are going to deliver on time 100%, and we are going to promise more hashrate IF we happen to deliver late" which they did and they didnt honor that promise. I cant see into the future, your right its a risk to trust a new startup company but you would assume a certain kind of professionalism from these people considering they are well known engineers who've worked on nvidea chip design. And i didnt hire a lawyer, he doesnt get a cent until the case is won, so i have nothing to lose by suing those scum of the earth.

well-said. i couldnt agree more. the very fact they think they can regulate something that is unregulatable?, only proves their ignorance about bitcoin. Let them try, it will hurt business in NY and they will look very very stupid in the end. the day they regulate bitcoin is the day they regulate bittorrent. good luck to them.

I see the propaganda and brainwashing you've incurred in the states has worked wonders on you. Go back to eating grass sheep.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:20:23
A few months ago when i first got into the bitcoin scene and became super enthused about it, i had printed a bunch of informative flyers targeting small businesses that eloquently explains how easy it is for them to start accepting, and the benefits etc. 
I must have walked into a hundred bars, restaurants, and random brick-and-mortar businesses in a 2 mile area handing out flyers. I even posted some flyers near entrances of banks and on their windows. 
I know it takes time for people to educate themselves on a confusing topic like bitcoin, but i couldn't help myself wonder if i even had the slightest effect in the community in terms of awareness. Eventually I felt like i was teaching calculus to hamsters. Some of them even thought i was offering to sell them bitcoin or offering some kind of service for money.
The problem with this is that it doesn't reach people on a mass scale. If they don't get the official "green light" from their propaganda boxes, i don't think they will ever realize how disruptive and beneficial this technology is (look how long it took for the average joe to realize how powerful the internet actually is) 
I've always wanted to setup a small crowdfunding website that lets us create "goals" for certain projects and have them crowdfunded by us- one project being a commercial we can have run for a few weeks across the nation(or w.e). The problem is i don't know where to start, i don't have any website design experience, or experience in coding. 
The Reddit community has banded together in the past to reach goals most people couldn't on their own. So, how can we get something like this going?
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:51:05
That's not the point, at least you would bring awarness to someone whose never heard of it, plus you don't know how they will use that info, maybe they will in fact bring this to someone who does have the power to do something, etc.

No, you have it the other way around. The currency is heavily dependent on the many uses the blockchain tech has to offer. The more applications blockchain tech can provide, the higher the value of bitcoin(currency). IMO blockchain tech is invaluable, because no matter what bitcoin the currency is worth, the blockchain tech still works and never changes its primary function. The value of this tech remains static because at its core it never changes and always works. And miners will always have incentive to mine because there will always be people using bitcoin no matter how much resources and miners are thrown at it.

Blockchain technology has value because it can be used for more than just currency, which is only one application of block chain tech. 
However, btc only has value BECAUSE of block chain tech. Without that tech bitcoin the currency wouldn't have a value at all.

Dont forget and They have tipped me well in the past and I am forwarding their kindness to others. 
Not too many people get just how much awareness and a positive image this is giving to bitcoin. 
We are accelerating the network effect exponentially with every new user we tip, even tipping a quarter or 50c is enough for them to create a changetip account(which literally takes seconds if linking to your reddit/youtube/etc) and fund that account with btc. 
Don't forget all the many users who browse the comments section on reddit/yt/twitter and see this cool new magic internet money that people are tipping to each other. That in itself raises awareness to whole new level. 
The guys at changetip are doing a great job, keep up the good work fellas! We at r/bitcoin love you!!

Thanks for your input. I just don't understand how this is different than any other alt coin. I know that it makes it easier to create block-chain like technology for devs and programmers, but IMO if a dev or programmer can use Ethereum to create a smart contract, currency, escrow etc, then why wouldnt they be able to do that with bitcoin itself? Is Ethereum so easy that it can be used by non-devs and slightly tech-savvy nerds?

I'm 29. Came here when i was 3. My family and I have been law-abiding citizens since, give or take some minor offenses. 
At the age of 17, couple months post-911, 3am, FBI raided our home and incarcerated us for 4 months. No charges. I remember one of the agents telling my older bro to "get down on your knees like how you pray." He flipped out, they subdued him. 
Took us to federal plaza for the day. Shipped my parents and older sisters/bro to seperate federal prison facilities. Took my juvenile ass to a juvy camp in reading, penn. 
Long story short: Terrorism. We received a gag order.

Technically they could yes, but it's not in their best interest to as it would ruin their reputation and such. 
That's why you shouldn't trust anyone with your own wallet, that's the beauty of bitcoin: you are your own bank. 
Web wallets and mobile wallets aren't meant to keep large sums of money on, only a bit to buy everyday things like coffee, food etc. Do you walk around with hundreds of dollars of cash on you? 
If you want to safely keep large sums of money create an offline encrypted wallet and put a password on it, just don't forget the password or your fu*ed. Search online for the best ways to do this.

I think you should look at [Ethereum's Whitepaper]( before you compare it to maidsafe and storj. 
I believe what most people on this sub can't grasp about Ethereum is that its a block chain language, a tool to allow a dev to create any turing-complete blockchain app and store it on the main chain. 
Many people will agree with me that bitcoin's scripting language is limited and its code is very intertwined together to not allow it to be changed without messing up the jenga blocks(no pun intended). 
Blockchain has many use cases, and bitcoin simply can't handle all of these apps on its chain. That's where alt-coins come in(the ones that actually do something) like NXT, primecoin, counterparty, ethereum etc. Ethereum actually solves a lot of bitcoin's "problems" in that its a much more robust, complete block chain that anyone can use to add anything to it. 
Bitcoin doesnt have to be like ethereum, bitcoin is only used for 1 simple use case of the block chain- money. That's why it works the way it works, it does one thing and one thing alone and that's transferring money over the internets. It doesn't have to be complex, but Ethereum does- that's why it was built from the ground up.

You don't have to download the entire blockchain to use bitcoin, There are light clients you can use like Electrum, Multibit. Also you have the option of using a web-based wallet like blockchain.info and mycelium although keep in mind they do keep your private keys so if they get hacked there's a chance your bitcoin can get lost.

What article? What are you talking about buddy?
Edit: ok so the question was about CT? That still doesnt justify using a scam companys name for publicity. They shouldnt even bring them up. That goes for BFL as well.

No, its basically a consultant-type business where i setup/educate merchants on how to safely accept bitcoin for their business. "Bitcoin Integration Services."

they are trying to take advtange of the mining industry and fool a whole bunch of people who think they are going to make a profit from this. Just what BFL did, Cointerra, and other mining companies. They will build these machines, use them for themselves to mine a bit then sell the reused machines to retards who think they are 1)contributing to the network and 2)making a profit. Theres no code you can't create that requires this machine. It's a rPi with developer stack built into it. big whoop. This is their "IoT" yea right.

Bitcoin is still a very young technology, the severe price swings are going to happen for a very long time. You cannot buy everything with bitcoin yet- its not a closed economy, its still very much developing every day. To mitigate volatility and friction merchants have to use services like bitpay to convert to fiat to cover expenses (salaries,product, etc) In an ideal world we wouldn't be converting at all, but like i said this tech is very much in its infancy and these services help merchant and user adoption, for now. In the future i don't see these kinds of services necessary because Bitcoin will be ubiquitous and there will not be a need to convert at all.

@_date: 2015-09-21 20:28:13
Your average consumer will look at this and assume you can make a profit because the machine is "mining" bitcoins, when in reality your just given a constant stream of coins that doesn't amount to much (we're not even told how much it can generate vs how much they disperse vs what percentage they cut). 
The profit making will be through selling third party products for bitcoin. This is sort of false advertising saying this is a "bitcoin computer" one would assume it does nothing but mine. Of course we know that's not true but your average joe wont.

You mean its not a matter of learning the program that the website uses and simply adding code, like a bitpay API? The thing is i would like to do it myself if its a matter of following simple steps, instead of having to pay someone to do it if the client already has a website. My question is: are there many different "types" of website-building programs that need to be learned or are most new ones basically all the same?

The dumbest thing you did here was not directly moving your coins from coinbase to agora(which coinbase most likely knows about), but that you are trying to buy fake IDs from there and posting about it on reddit. 
Do you not have the slightest common sense? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:02:41
all they had to do was throw the bitcoin logo somewhere on that massive screen for increased exposure. 
how hard was that to do ?

Bitpay is used only to convert bitcoin to fiat, as most merchants will want to to reduce risk of volatility. I can't see a merchant accepting bitcoin into their own wallet, then going out and selling them a market value, or on an exchange. Bitpay reduces all the friction to make it easier on the merchant. Fiat is sent straight into the business account.

I was thinking exactly that a while back, there should be some incentive program for bitpay that if you manage to convince a business to accept bitcoin through them(and set it up for them), they can pay you for your work. 
We could open up a business ground-up and do all the work ourselves, but then we would need capital to convert Bitcoin to Fiat.
If you are interested in this i think i could be of help. Let me know if you want to collaborate.

@_date: 2015-02-01 08:03:44
BUT, what if we ALL decided not to cave and sell for no less than a million. We just have to have faith and trust each other that way everyone gets a million. My logic is undeniable. 
edit. upvoted for your generosity. i think i get it now 
@_date: 2015-02-01 08:21:37
I'm saying what if the sell order is fake, i put up a sell order for a million and i have a guy who buys it for a million only to make it look real, but the guy gets his money back. im not trolling just genuinely curious. is this possible? maybe that will start a domino effect of million/billionaires who buy at that price ...
