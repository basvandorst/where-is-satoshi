Well a 34% attack is just a censorship attack. You can block transactions from being verified but you can't start moving ether from one wallet to another. To do that you need 51%. 
So let's say 60% of all ether is staked. Some is lost, some is on exchanges, some is just sitting.
To achieve a 51% attack, you would need to own 30.6% of all ether. That is about 29 million ether, at a market value of 9 billion dollars. Obviously you can't hop on GDAX and buy 29 million ETH though. I have no idea how to calculate how much market buying 29 million ETH would cost, but it would be a fuck load of money, and since ETH is not a physical tangible item, it is much harder for an army to seize.
To achieve 51% of bitcoin's hash rate, China would need to seize 3-4 mining pools, and maybe Jihan's ASIC factories for a while. I am sure the pools have a kill  switch of sorts in place, but as far as I can tell, POS is way harder to mess with. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:02:34
Not true. Contract source can be posted publically and you can compile it yourself and see if it matches up. 
And the network is already scaling better than bitcoin, and it has a way more concrete plan to continue scaling. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:45:39
Spelling and grammar in english is completely off the rails insane too, but here we all are using it just fine. Of course Solidity isn't perfect, Vitalik and everyone else will tell you that. Difference is, it isn't vaporware like this, and there are a lot of people working on improving instead of arguing about fucking block size. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:36:33
Having the code visible on the blockchain would just inflate the size of it for no reason. Post the code publicly, and allow others to compile it and see if it matches up. Either it does or it doesn't, there is no wiggle room or margin of error, the results will be the exact same every time. If you don't trust the contract, and the code is not made public, simply don't interact with the contract. 
And to bring up the DAO is like saying you don't trust computers because you once downloaded a program with a bug. Or you don't trust English because you once made a spelling mistake. Of course a smart contract will only be as good as the person who writes it, but that is not a criticism of ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:26:49
I don't think so. If you could market buy all ethereum in existence right now, you would be looking at 15 billion dollars at least to achieve the attack. But obviously trying to buying that much would push the price way up meaning you would likely be spending 100s of billions. POS is still 2 years off though, and I think a 100 billion market cap for ETH in 2 years is very possible. There is really no reasonable way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:57:23
If bitcoin is forking over 1mb vs 2mb blocks I really can't see it completely changing its consensus algorithm. 
I see a lot of value in Ethereum right now because of the very well defined plan for its future, and because it is attracting so much developer attention. I have been following bitcoin since 2010, and I wish I could say the same about it, but I can't.

OK so if you want a "bitcoin style full node" you need an SSD, but if you don't have one, a pruned tree on a hard drive is just as secure. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:39:45
Ah yes the great pizza slice heist of 2017. One for the books. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:09:47
OK well first of all this isn't an east vs west debate. Bitcoin does not have borders.
Second, I think you have a misunderstanding of how POS works. To be a validator does not mean you can just spin up a bunch of nodes and have a majority consensus just like that. 
To attack the blockchain would require that you own at least 34% of all staked coins/ether. Obviously this is incredibly expensive. If you did attack the blockchain you would be risking losing all 34%. That is a pretty stupid risk to take. 


It is a hell of a lot harder to amass 34-67% of all staked coins/ether/whatever than it is to take over a few centralized mining farms. POS is way more decentralized because there are no economies of scale. $10 gets you exactly 10x the returns that $1 gets you. This is the exact of opposite of centralized mining cartels. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:43:53
POS is going to be awesome! Right now I really can't mine profitably because power is so expensive where I live. After POS I will be able to secure the network myself. I really don't see how it could not be more decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:43:05
Either the block headers match up or they don't right? I don't think that can be manipulated without a 51% attack and at that point the whole chain is fucked regardless. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:52:47
At first you will need ~32, but you can make a trustless staking pool through smart contracts anyways. When it is completely done you will be able to stake any amount. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:13:35
This is the best resource I have found for POS facts.
Most is way over my head, but my favourite points are:




@_date: 2017-10-09 14:38:44
Not bad just much more centralized. And unnecessarily wasteful if PoS works out. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:19:09
Well first of all, it is ridiculous to claim you can't do a full sync because one guy is having troubles with what I assume is some busted ass IDE drive and a dial up connection. Many people store the full chain. And second, there is no really reason to do a full sync other than as a neat thing to do. A pruned chain is 100% as secure. This is a fundamental difference between ETH and BTC.

POW was definitely  a revolutionary idea, but because of the massive amounts of energy it takes, we are already feeling the effects of Chinese centralization of mining due to the availability of cheap energy there.  It is within the realm of possibility right now for the Chinese military to knock on the door of every miner in the country and attack bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-08 21:58:10
You would need over 33% I think to do some damage. This would be massively expensive, and you can only do it once because your ether will be burned. Imagine if you amassed  enough hash rate to attack bitcoin, and when you were done, your mining farm burned down. 
If you are able to amass over 50% of all ethereum, attacking the network is pointless because as soon as you do it, ether will be worthless anyways.

Actually 2 addresses, sending him a total of 20 bitcoins between the two. Both of those original sending addresses appear to have had 10 bitcoins each in them plus some extra for fees. All of the original transactions are within just over a minute. If you follow the transactions back you can see he sent the money through a tonne of addresses. [This address sent money to two other addresses that sent money to the two addresses that made the big donations to HiMom.](
What I think happened here is, he sent himself the big donations to get into the news and hopefully create a bandwagon effect. Pretty clever, it looks like he got himself about 2.3 bitcoins so far.
