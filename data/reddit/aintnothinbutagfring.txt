Where are you inferring that I would ever say that from? I wouldn't just say an exchange. If they were in the U.S. I'd probably recommend Coinbase as a fine establishment for exchanging bitcoin
edit: if they were in Canada (where I live now), I actually *would* recommend an exchange. Except I wouldn't call it an exchange; I'd call it a p2p trading platform and make sure they knew what that meant.. otherwise they'd probably end up getting ass-raped by CanadianBitcoins or another such business that takes advantage of new bitcoin users who don't want to use a p2p exchange.

Do you ship to Canada? Because if so I predict a bitcoin order in the near future.

This 100%. People, if you use TOR for anything you don't want to be MITM'ed on you need to ensure your session is encrypted. If you're using https then as long as your machine isn't compromised, and the remote service isn't compromised, and their SSL certificate isn't compromised, you should be alright.
@_date: 2014-07-05 09:07:24
YOU need to ensure you are using https. If you're supposedly connected to a secure service that uses SSL, then checking to make sure you are connected via https is what lets you know everything is all good. An attacker can intercept requests and return false responses that look otherwise legitimate. They CAN'T do this over SSL though because your browser will detect that they are not signing their responses with the proper certificate.

Alright, well we can make it contingent on the auction results being public. How does 100 mBTC sound? And market data from bitstamp.
edit: Also, one more term, since there are 10 blocks being auctioned off: All of the blocks have to be either over or under the prior 24 hour market BTC average. If some are over and some are under we'll call it a split.

If I go to a place that exchanges USD for CAD, I've gone to an exchange. Even though it's not p2p, it's still called an exchange. Coinbase doesn't sell bitcoin like walmart sells water, the price of bitcoin changes every minute and can be purchased and sold in any increment..
Also, you don't go to walmart and load up your fiat balance, then exchange it for water, which then stays in walmart in your water balance until you decide to transfer it to another water exchange, or exchange it back to fiat. Coinbase provides transfer services between USD and BTC and keeps running balances of both. Coinbase even mentions that they provide 'bitcoin exchange' services in their user agreement. No one refers to themselves as providing 'water exchange' services.
edit: tell you what. In the context of exactly what my original post was about, how would you refer to the collection of businesses that allow all of the things I've mentioned (exchanging fiat for btc, and keeping a balance of both for their users to convert back and forth between the two). I call them exchanges. Because I don't think I should have to spell out what I'm talking about every time when exchange is a perfect word for the concept I'm referring to, and everyone knows exactly what I'm talking about because I couldn't possibly be referring to *your* vision of an exchange (as a p2p trading post) from context.

I take it you don't have an answer for this, and moreso I still believe my use of the word 'exchange' was the best possible word and would do it again. Just because it doesn't fit the finance definition of an exchange market doesn't mean it's not an exchange in another sense of the word.

Reddit doesn't actually do this. You can see a user's total points, but not by subreddit.

pay attention to what is saying because they are spot on. It's your responsibility to use SSL. If you have caller ID that tells you with 100% certainty who is calling you and you get a phone call from your 'bank', it's your responsibility to ensure the caller ID confirms their identity before you reveal critical information. If you don't check the caller ID and then find out you've been scammed, that's your fault, not your bank's.

This is impossible. If droves of people start flocking to coinbase to buy bitcoin, coinbase starts buying up more bitcoin from the exchanges (assuming they are operating honestly). A demand for bitcoin on coinbase is a demand for bitcoin is a demand for bitcoin, and vice versa. Furthermore, coinbase is a *huge* player, probably processing at a minimum 20% of U.S. merchant bitcoin transactions.
Back to my previous question though, what would *you* say is the *accurate* catch-all term for what I referred to as an exchange.

The ATM at Waves seems to use Candian Bitcoins and I imagine charges a percentage on the [already 7-10% spread in difference]( between buying and selling.

You're comparing bitcoin to water. If we were on which was devoted to the discussion of water as a currency, then yes I'd say any place that let you exchange water for other forms of currency (especially in non-discrete units) would be an exchange.
I realize bitcoin's status as a true currency is debatable, but much of the discussion on this subreddit at the very least *is specifically centered around* its currency-like qualities, so with that in mind it's understandable to refer to any place where bitcoin and fiat is exchanged as an exchange.
Similarly, people refer to 'trading' bitcoin, like they would stocks, or forex.

Think of how much time you've spent learning how to use fiat. For starters, none of us were completely natural at things like making change, learning how to pay for things with the denominations of coins available (remember learning how to select the number of coins to add up to a total in grade school), figuring out how to carry and handle money in ways that made us less likely to lose it, etc. And that's just cash. Now think about signing up for your bank account, learning the basics of using an ATM, depositing, withdrawing, dealing with bank fees, checking your balance, avoiding overdrafting, managing multiple bank accounts, learning how to write checks, balancing a checkbook, taking pending payments into account, transferring money from one account to another, transferring money to other people, figuring out how to pay for things online (paypal?). Don't even get me started on credit cards or calculating interest.
Bitcoin has a learning curve, sure, but so does any form of currency. One of its biggest advantages over fiat, however, is that it's a *global* currency that works the same anywhere if you're just considering the bitcoin network as a closed system. No hidden fees, no balancing checks, no bullshit. There's fancy math behind it, sure, but that's all abstracted away by software. Using bitcoin eventually will be as easy as point and click. The rough edges typically appear where it comes into contact with real-world money. Right now it's new and a lot of these rough edges aren't as polished as they will be, and the services for abstracting the low-level details aren't as user-friendly as they will be. That doesn't mean the potential to replace fiat for the layman isn't there.

I don't really understand how whitelisting would even work. Would it be like a business refusing to accept cash that has trace amounts of cocaine? What happens if someone with 'dirty' bits sends some small amount to every address in the whitelist?

I use coinbase. I use campbx. I understand how they're different. That being said, Coinbase is a service for buying and selling bitcoins (among other things). That makes it an exchange in my eyes, as well as whoever created their wikipedia article and many numerous news article. You're exchanging bitcoin for fiat. Show me a definition of exchange that would exclude coinbase.
edit: here, from Coinbase's user agreement:






Of course, you could continue being a pedantic asshat and insisting that Coinbase isn't an exchange because even though they offer exchange services they don't conform to what your idea of an exchange is. But it should be pretty obvious that my usage of exchange was a platform that allows exchanging bitcoins for fiat, from context, ya know?
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:03:48
I see now. You're right, it's not a very significant difference if you're buying, but the difference is more noticeable when selling.

I understand the difference between Coinbase and an exchange market, but I still think it's fair to refer to coinbase as an exchange rather than get into all of that. For the purpose of my original point, expounding on the use of the word exchange would be superfluous, and furthermore I don't think there was anyone who was confused about what I was talking about when I used the word exchange in `What's crazy is that anyone can open an 'exchange' and start selling bitcoins they don't actually have access to` in my original point.
But for the sake of avoiding this debate again, I will from here on refer to businesses that provide exchange services as 'fine institutions that provide exchange services'

[uh..]( Not every exchange is necessarily a p2p trading platform, but coinbase *is* an exchange.


Maybe not $100, but there are certainly markets with $50-80 differentials between them.


What we need is some way of providing an incentive for exchanges to handle their transactions on the blockchain or provide proof that they are fully liquid.
