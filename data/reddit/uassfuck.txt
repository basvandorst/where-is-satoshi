Eat shit you scam shill! You were all happy about the cens\*\*ship there when you and the mo\*\*rators together were shilling for your failed scam called UASF (which was pretty commy by the way). Even with the cens\*\*ship the users who supported the UASF scam were almost exclusively just the shills and astrotur\*ers like you, not actual marks. Practically everyone who ever cared at all saw through it, despite the cens\*\*ship.

Clearly not hash.

User Activated Sorry For Your Loss? Spams on Mao (Samsung Mow)? Nope, no ridicule here. If anything, communists must be offended by being associated with your UASF, not the other way around.

Or else what? You're gonna call Core bad names, just like the other fork shills do?

Sure... people who criticize it for basically not being their favorite brand of fork and not coming from their idols. Those are the kinds of people who keep posting. And you are surprised that they fill the vacuum? Makes for great discussions, if you are into troll art. Troll versus troll.


I was thinking of doing exactly the opposite. Don't tell me to read more. It's becoming all crap.

Show me on the doll where core touched you.

But are they? They are equivalent to the actions that the supporters of SegWit2x take, for which you said:


Is creating some fantasy land altcoin and calling it "Bitcoin" appropriate? This is what you do.

It's all good, but if I were to tell you that you are a fool for supporting BIP148, and even thoroughly explain to you exactly why, I'd get the banhammer here. You won't be allowed to read the comment, and I won't be allowed to know that no one is allowed to read it. That's the sad reality, I've seen it. And so my time would have been wasted and you'll just continue getting easily fooled, as you have been in the past.

Unexpectedly Absconding with Suckers' Funds.

There's no UASF without stupid.

We already have the mess that the other fork shills created... so we know how to deal with that kind of mess. If you want to be the next Roger Ver (minus the money, name, influence, ability to sound convincing, etc etc) go ahead. No one will stop you.

So you pumped the BIP148 altcoin which initiated the SegWit2x altcoin? Fucking altcoiners. Are you proud of helping create all those altcoins?
