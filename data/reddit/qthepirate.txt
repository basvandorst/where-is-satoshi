I was about to make a joke about the historical great Schism here and mix it with bitcoin, but it could've been taken wrong as me being a troll instead of trying to be funny. I shouldn't have to limit myself in a semi-open forum like this, but that's what all these trolls have brought us to.

This works! Thank you.

Right, it wasn't vpn I didnt understand (network security manager here), its using it on the ledger.

Right. That cliff post is meant to spook people. But, everything as such is taken out of context of the bigger picture.

Thank you! A non-troll post in a sea of trolls lately. Watching now.

I asked a similar question. This link was given to me.

Check the block on blockchain. I use Mycelium and it just said "0 confirmations". Turns out the block was orphaned.

I don't believe that the banks are trying to create their own currency. The would be using this to do for fiat what Bitcoin has done for itself.

Just raising discussion. I'm trying to be more involved here rather than the lurker I've been.
@_date: 2015-12-06 06:39:05
I'm going to say I'm not sure if I agree with the other posts on here, some calling $650 and some calling $900 (different thread). But, I will agree with thinking it will go up. Based on the amount of good news and major companies not just noticing the trend but publicly stating it. At this point I don't believe its a "have faith" that we're going to the moon. It WILL happen. It's just a matter of time at this point.
@_date: 2015-12-30 06:47:14

The issue with article like this affecting the community is... Wait for it... The title.
People are idiots (most present company excepted) and will only read the title and assume that's what the whole story. Again, being idiots, they will take that face value as fact and begin to believe it as the truth. And then the downward spiral of faith begins.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:13:22
Yes. That.

Because it's based on business days, it depends on when the order is placed. I just bought right now and it tells me to expect it on the 28th (because of christmas)

So even though SW is all in all a good idea, people go tinfoil hat because its core? (Tinfoil hat may seem extreme, but its a closer overestimate than the word I'd use to underestimate)
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:33:21
OH! So its kind like having a consultant on retainer: some money might come back, some might go for services, but in the end only the final amount is published to the chain.
Edit: accidentally a word.

@_date: 2016-01-30 11:41:20
In the future, when a blocksize increase hardfork happens (it will eventually have to) wouldn't it make such an increase MORE effective?
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:58:45
And i saw that too, which is what confuses me with those who are anxious to get the size increase done NOW.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:24:32
Well, we are not processing one item at a time. Maybe everyone just sees the block limit benefit out of it while the limit issuss are still being worked out? Would it still be wrong?
@_date: 2016-01-31 08:48:42
Those are some exciting things and this is the first I've heard of them. I want to be able to be more active with Bitcoin, but my code-fu is limited and I'm only a network security tech.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:32:27
So they believe its a bandaid excuse rather than those still pushing a 2MB hard fork?
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:18:59
Thanks to Mike we have cheaper coins! Its a good time!
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:48:54
So this whole "Schism threat" we are facing is essentially whether to implement it now or later? I understand the Bitcoin community evolves at a variable rate, but since we havent maxed out our blocks YET (we see it coming), wouldn't the April launch date be right on the money? (Pun fully intended, I am the pun-isher)
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:45:59
Ahh! Learn something new every day!
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:06:38
Ahh, so your saying its because there hasnt been a good look at the cons, and people are pushing it due to the transaction amount benefit.
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:16:24
On that point, because its currently in testing, why all the fuss about it not being implemented until April if the testing will look at such items?
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:09:44
Well, it looks like SW is tackling half the problem: maybe not the bandwidth problem, but the transaction amount. Then it could be *broadly* compared as packing more transactions in a single block.
@_date: 2016-01-09 05:25:31
I'm originally from there, live in SD. I'll see if there's a meet up when i head up next month.
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:12:02
Right right. I agree with what you are saying, which is what I've been thinking: if SW with a hard fork is done, that would be the time to add a limit increase as well. But, wouldn't the amount of transaction space with SW + limit increase be (very roughly) equivalent to if we just went ahead and did a blocksize increase to 4MB. And then, wouldn't the arguments against an increase of that size come into play there?
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:43:06
Which is why I always ask for citation if something doesn't seem right. Thank you, I thought I was having a stroke trying to comprehend it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:40:53
But wouldn't these other layers be able to use it as well? Since its primarily for the signing portion?
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:36:04
What is this "attack"? Why would adding it require 4MB blocks? Doesn't it give us .75MB free space, therefore only 1.75MB of a block equivalent?
I understand the equivalent of 4MB now
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:47:47
I understand that emotion in these arguments can create a "spite them just because" attitude. But what about those saying its just a cough suppressant and not a cure?
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:25:45
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:31:15
We know we are going to have to raise it eventually, but wouldn't SW increase the effectiveness of each raise we get? Yes it helps with the cap problems, but why not just use it as another tool AND look at increases still?
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:19:58
From what I'm seeing, its not a set number. Its based on the blocksize. So later down the road, when we do move to 2MB, SW will allow us to essentially use an extra 1.75MB of space, equalling 3.75 (or 3.5 as some have put it, someone please check my math)
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:21:39
I want to believe
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:44:37
It seems like with the lightning network, everything is going to have to be published to the chain EVENTUALLY, so i don't understand how it would help. From what I'm reading, SW isn't a cure, but only lessening the symptoms?
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:04:51
Don't know what you said, but points for being a good person! :-)
@_date: 2016-01-01 08:29:08
If you have a CHECK check, you can always cash it somewhere, then use localbitcoins. Your issue will still be wherever you cash the check.
@_date: 2016-01-31 08:08:45
But based on the videos ive seen. Wouldn't that essentially leave a portion locked in a sort of "escrow"?
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:34:50
If that's the case, and the amount of each block is opened up for transaction space, then why is everyone still freaking out about blocksize when we clearly have a good way ahead?
Sidenote: only on Reddit can I engage in a civil conversation with someone who has the username "homopit"
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:49:00
I still don't understand. Can you link some documentation or sources?
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:31:00
So you believe it's a "grrr core" mindset?
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:14:25
I understand that, as not only does this help lessen the effects of us hitting max cap, IBLN and other solutions will help minimize transactions on the chain. Do you believe that we will have to hard fork to a higher size eventually? Or will there be enough additions to lower the transactions that actually hit the chain that we won't have to?
@_date: 2016-01-01 08:29:39
Unless, you cash it to a bank, buy at coinbase, transfer to wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:23:45
I've never really held an opinion on the topic because I never quite understood the full argument, but I'm beginning to agree with your assessment.
Edit: ..aaaaand just saw who I was replying to. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:27:51
Took me a minute to word this properly to convey what I'm trying to ask.
So just ignore the accounting trick and raise the size while keeping the SW benefits? Or drop SW altogether and just raise the size?
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:38:55

The issue is tax avoidance, not privacy. On that note though, banking overseas would only be tax avoidance on interest rates (im clearly not an expert, someone correct me).
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:54:51
I believe your scenario should be the standard to which all scenarios are held. 
I though so too, nothing is preventing both sides from happening, it seems that some people just want theirs to be done NOW as opposed to later. So, what they do is try to invalidate the other side in order for theirs to be implemented quicker.
