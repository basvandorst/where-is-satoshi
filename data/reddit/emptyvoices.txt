I would say that people not fully educated in safely holding, trasferring, etc with bitcoin would be safer holding cash. bitcoin is safe if you know what you are doing, but is some 80 year old guy who sends money to nigerian princes going to be safe with bitcoin? No.

Yes, perhaps redirect error...fucked up .htaccess or php.ini rules. I just want it to get attention so they take action ASAP. If they had a phone number I would have called them.

At my credit union the tellers only keep $3k in case they get robbed (pretty much the same policy for all banks). The most I've taken out is 
10k to buy a car and I just had to wait like 20 minutes for them to get a manager to go into the vault and for someone to count it. 
Obviously if I wanted like 100k+ I would it expect it to take a week or so which isn't a big deal. 
I love bitcoin but I just don't see this as being an argument for it really at this stage. No one is going permanently to not using fiat anytime soon.

Great! Look forward to helping you out :)

You clearly don't understand the term bankruptcy protection at all. The protection is from their creditors. Since it was approved by the Japanese government, their creditors cannot file lawsuits against them.
Yeah...it forwards right to bankruptcy...because that's what it is.

Yeah...I'm not telling you how much BTC I have, who I am or any of my addresses. If you are looking for people with 3000+ and you want them to prove they have 3000+...not going to happen unless they are idiots.
"This is where I keep my $3 million"   ...no thanks.
If you want advice, I am sure many people on here would, myself included, if you just made a post outlining the basics of your plan. And if you want to discuss in private, fine, but you can't expect people will reveal much personal details or verification.

Mostly to show support for it. If you have some bitcoin you were maybe going to pull out anyway and want something from tigerdirect you can avoid using some of your credit limit or cash. 
Obviously it might not be worth the hassle to deposit to coinbase just to buy something from there, but by supporting btc it will get more widespread and eventually it will be easier to do and perks will implemented.

Or you can get it cheaper from us: 
And we take bitcoin of course. Domains at $9.99 (namecheap charges $10.69) and hosting starting at $2.22/month.
Just sayin'.

Okay. It now says:

I have not received an email from localbitcoins. (checked SPAM folder as well)

wow...you are literally out of your mind delusional. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:34:17
seriously ebay/paypal thinking about taking bitcoin? lol, yeah right. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:42:34
Trying to selling your goxcoins not cheap? Not going to happen.

but is it an e3 with 32gb of ram?

The HSBC guy paid in fiat so...

This is not a case of being blocked due to failed logins. I have cleared cache/cookies and tried from multiple networks, devices. My login is successful, as when I hit back it gives me the welcome greeting but I cannot access any other pages as they all again forward to this admin login.
If I enter multiple wrong attempts on the admin login page it shows this:  
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:33:13
We could do that for $239/month (If you went month-to-month).
The Ram is an extra $80 per month, the Bandwidth an extra $20.
Annual Contract would be around $175/month.
It would be in our Pennsylvania Datacenter.

Totally read the title as bitstamp instead of bitinstant....

You don't get a lump sum $10k. You get 25% of the fees until you've made $10k.

Unless unbeknownst to me I have been made an administrator... 
I can't access my account because every time I try to log in it forwards me to the admin backend for which I obviously don't know the credentials. 
Entering my user / pass gives a message telling me to enter the info for a staff account. 
Edit: I have tried from multiple computers, on multiple networks including from my phone on the verizon mobile network and it all has same result.
I would appreciate if others could let me know if they can log in, or if for some reason the system has just me erroneously set as an admin/staff user. Just want to know if it is just me, or a global issue. Either way this needs attention.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:05:56
Vaguest title ever.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:15:18
...what exactly would they take?
Unless they ask for the key to the account you want to transfer the funds to, but I don't think anyone here would fall for that.
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:05:01
Oh yeah, I remember everyone had to change their passwords. I didn't realize the hackers actually got the passwords though. I thought they only tried. Damn. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:16:43
No. They got DDOS'ed, but not hacked. So the site went down but no data was compromised.
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:33:55
Around $1.50 (just looked it up using the adwords keyword tool).
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:06:58
check the server specials tab. There is one for $39 on that page.

Well if it was a long con he probably would have stayed behind the scenes and not let his face be known.

Any online retailer who doesn't own a payment processing service is probably thinking about it. 
I feel that if you are in a management position with decision making power over things like payment processing you have to be at least a little tech savvy and would have heard of bitcoin and how your competition is now accepting it.
The only question then is how to deal with things like taxes, but a little bit of research will show that with services like coinbase or bitpay your payments can be instantly converted to fiat and can be treated just like a cash/credit transaction. No need to worry about capital gains on bitcoins value, undocumented income or other complications. 
What about implementation? Well if you do any significant volume of transactions, coinbase or bitpay will literally do it for you to get you as a customer.
Maybe I am overestimating the competency of people who make these decisions but I feel like we can assume that if you've heard of the online retailer, they are at least discussing accepting bitcoin.

If you get it licensed in all 50 states I'll code it for free and you can keep the 50k.

Got it. Email was sent 2 days ago which is why i didn't see it. closing thread.
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:39:09
Yes, but then how do you pay off the loan without converting some of your bitcoin to fiat or moving it?

I PM'd the address, thanks :)

Can't believe they ruled on itcoin before bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:10:26
If guys want to give BTC to girls to show off their bits, then so be it. It's not illegal. If you don't like it, don't go there and don't participate. Simple as that.

Given his profile, i'm astonished he decided to use PayPal at all in the first place. I mean, he had to see this coming.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:40:19
If it is, it is likely only temporary at best. So not really great news if that is the only reason for the jump.

... You're title implies China was trying to inconvenience bitcoin by applying heavy sanctions or something. Which is not the case. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:55:15
Where do you think you are? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:41:02
You have to realize that the headlines in China read 'our notoriously shitty gov't is regulating bitcoin'  and most people didn't look at the details. Same way as if we saw that headline here our first thought would be that heavy sanctions are being imposed. Then the market would rebound as ppl realize 'oh wait it's cool I don't have to dump all my btc'. Which is exactly what is happening. Nothing to see here folks.

If complaints actually had an effect BoA would have been out of business years ago. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:49:59
Pretty much applies to every sector of the web, not just bitcoin.
If I had a Satoshi for every time I've seen a "I have a fantastic website idea that seems simple in my head but I don't actually understand the massive development scope of this undertaking. Budget: $800" post I could quit my job as a developer. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 06:10:48
Yes, if the USA had defaulted it would have been a boost to  an alternative instrument like bitcoin so technically it is a negative. But I think the scare alone is an overall positive given the fact that this is yet again only a temporary duct-tape fix and will likely be a clusterfuck again come early 2014. Not to mention that a default would have impacted the global economy so broadly that it wouldn't necessarily have been good for any financial instrument.
I think it will still boost bitcoin in the long run, especially in markets like China that previously relied so heavily on the stability of the US dollar.
