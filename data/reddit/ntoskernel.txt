If putin said this, then he probably sees it as fitting the communist model.

Libra will not happen. In the UK - there has been very clear statements that cash will not be removed from the economy. The previous chancellor of the treasury recently made such a statement in the last 6 months. Unlike Bitcoin, Libra will not enter the market unless they can dominate the market. They simply will not be able to when there are clear statements that cash will be king.
I think Trump has made similar soundings in the US. So this talk of libra, in my eyes, is just that talk.
The real question that people need to address is this. How much bitcoin does it cost me to buy coffee? Until you can address that simple question, all subsequent musings are moot. Value is has to be represented in some form. If I go into a local coffee shop, it clearly says on the board 1 coffee = £1.50.
I am not looking for fiat comparision I want to know in whole or in part what a cup of coffee costs in bitcoin. That is proper representative value.
On another social media platform someone commented on how they entered an account number incorrectly for a bank transfer. It was easily corrected by the bank. I quipped imagine making the same mistake with Bitcoin? Imagine making a payment to Tax Collector for 5grand and getting the account number wrong. With Bitcoin as it currently stands your screwed.
Cash will continue to be king, until practical matters are addressed.
I await the flames from the bulls to commence shortly.

I would recommend having installed and used it.

Because a few players (whales) hold a large number of coins and are able to manipulate the price.

Blockchain, oh look at that, its all new and shiny. Yet it provides no real benefit that you cannot already do with other technologies.
Solve the problem, do not use a tech because its the latest fancy.
As for certifications, pointless. Clearly run by people who do not know their arses from their elbows. You have proven you can learn new things, by doing a degree. Thats what an prospective employer would want.
