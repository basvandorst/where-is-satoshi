I don't think It is scam. I heard that It is developed by MinerGate developer team and It is regularly being recommended by big investors and crypto site reviewers.

Sounds interesting device. However the fact that Opendime is a electronic device without backup is a big issue for me.

I can able to see Nano s in stock. However, Ledger blue is out of stock. It might be temporary notice. Go ahead and place your pre-order, you should get it within 1-2 weeks based on your location.

I prefer Nano s over Trezor as It has quite good feature and affordable too.

It worth only if you are Asic miner.

I wish if there are some trusted bitcoin investment site. Anybody heard about bitcoinira?

I have been using Ledger Nano s and very much happy with it. It is cheaper than Trezor and offer more feature and security option too. customer service is outstanding!

Coinbase is best out of all due to strong security. However their fees are high and if you can't afford then got for Gdax; which is 2nd best option of of three. Gemini is less safer but fees are low.

But if we compare it with other cloud mining then we can say that it is far better than others as someone you can't get back your investment with competitors. It's the game of hash difficulty and bitcoin fork.

As per my knowledge, there isn't any. Still if any then requires lots of time to earn some considerable amount.

Ledger Nano s so far best hw wallet, I have ever used. Go for that!
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:10:11
If you are concern about security go for Ledger Nano S. If you are looking for affordable device the go for Nano S. If you want small Hw wallet then Trezor is good. However, It is just few inches less than Nano S.
