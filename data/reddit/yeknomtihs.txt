The significance of bitcoin is that it is extremely and easily divisible. It is not required to print more units of currency when you can break a bitcoin up into as many pieces as a computer is capable of recording. You cant split a copper coin into 20,000 pieces easily. You cant tear a 20 dollar bill in half and use it as 2 tens. With fiat, if more money is required to account for new economic growth, making up new whole units is the only option. That process is never implemented properly.
When you refer to the total amount of bitcoins, you sound like some who heard about bitcoin this morning.
You just don't get it. Stop. You are in over your head. Educate yourself or just stop talking. There are waaaay more complex issues at play here. Your non-existent comprehension of the basics are just a waste of time for everyone else. Throw away your keyboard. Read more. You havent earned the right to have an opinion. In fact, you should just never talk about money again to anyone.

Arguably the safest for online storage. Definitely the shitiest for actually trading. Kinda makes wonder whats the point right? If the front run you then you cant trade. Might as well not store online as that would be safer. On the other hand trading us risky. Why not trade in a place that is riskier for storage gut actually lets you trade?

Oh you clowns. Agnostic means "does not know".
It means the same thing in any industry.
Software today is hardware agnostic. Your applications talk to "the internet". Your software doesnt care or know if it is via wifi or ethernet.
The ethernet interface doesn't even know which specific chipsets are used in ethernet controller.
This is all due to layered interfaces that take create abstractions that are representatives of components behind them.
It is the same in finance. Someone may not care which asset or even know what they are investing in if the only thing they are interested in is high volatility. You can pick up the phone and tell your broker to go all in with full leverage on the highest volatile instrument. You'd then be asset class agnostic.

Exchanges should be held accountable so they dont wash trade, front run their customers, block access to accounts when they themselves trigger flash crashes, and simply steal their clients funds. We do actually need some level if policing in society.  We dont need wallstreet's flavour of scammery. We dont need  the FED's magic reserve rules. We dont need BTC IOU tickets.

All this 'institutions need the SECs help to get into the game' is just a disinformation campaign. Banks, large wallstreet players, billionaire dicks, private hedge funds etc are all buying at cost quietly. Public institutions are just a smoke screen. Private organisations can do whatever they want.
I have ben watching the exchanges for years. Whats is new in Bitcoin is whenever an agressive sell cascade occurs, there is always someone there to gobble up whatever us being sold. 
All this talk about bear market and selling us just chit chat for day traders. There is no selling anymore. Most if what you see is margin shorting. A promise to sell not an actuall sell. No one is giving up their coins anymore.
The truth of bitcoin is the scarcity. That will become apparent real quick when the bear game margins become too thin. It is imminent. Then you will see the bullshit artists talking about the overwhelming demand versus supply.
Sure Bitcoin's history has seen many flash crashes just prior to the bull runs. But we are talking about the wild west that was bitcoin. Now most frontier towns have sheriffs and the major exchanges see that. They are wise not to fuck themselves with fraud and wait to still be in business during the upcoming noobie stampede. I dont see another bottom spike comming. I see a 'so long suckers, you had your chance' coming.
I may be wrong. There may still be more criminal collusion between exchanges existing than i am inclined to believe. But i think the demand side legitimately out ways the supply side and tgere us only so far the manipulators are able to oush the price anymore. Even amoungst the bear market naysayers, you still find mostly long term bulls.

I just assume once the price reaches obvious sell peaks that the only ones buying and selling are robots trying to take advantage of the spread on the different exchanges. Though i guess the timing doesn't work out well for that in such circumstances.
Interesting levels? Sure, the price is going up, it is interesting. That still won't interfere with the charting and algorithmic trading which is the guiding driver of daily price. It will come down predictably on it's way up.
I was so proud of myself a couple weeks ago for finally dialling in the chart the  scammers are using to time their bullshit that I totally overlooked the fact that it was a sell point i had nailed well in advance. Soon enough as that intersection was met the Chinese crashed the price again.
Interesting would be breaking out of the channel for once.
@_date: 2017-02-01 07:59:59
So your point is you look for invested people ('experts') to give you numbers to gamble with? All you need is a piece of log paper, a ruler and a pencil.
All those posted figures are knowingly optimistic but not ridiculous. The growth has been very consistent and Bitcoin is already successful.
Those posted figures are coming soon. From a trading point of view, more percentage gains are going to come from bouncing up and down between 500 and 1000 than are going to come later. When it goes to 10,000, it is not going to be bouncing between 5,000 and 10,000 with as much volatility.
There is no difference between a move from 50,000 to 100,000 than there is between 500 and 1,000. It is not as though you are going to be making an easy 50,000 in a year just because you bought one. You won't be able to afford one. It's all about percentages, the price is irrelevant unless you bought early.
When the mainstream gets involved, they will only be thinking about some meagre gains in % for their volume x.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:37:42
I don't follow you. I found their explanation quite straightforward. If the spread is greater than 5-10% the market order is cancelled.
They suggest limit orders, but they don't swap in a limit order in for your market order.
Constantly issuing market sell orders should circumnavigate the 'protection'.
Besides, it took ~30 minutes to fall ~ 20%. 4 separate market orders from the same person or different is enough to move 20% in a sparse buy order book.
The system took a torrent of market sell orders so there is no way the 'market protection feature' had anything to do with the price decent.
That feature should simply protect users from the lag between requesting a market sell when they see the price at say $1100, and the trade system receiving it and determining the current price to be $400. In such a case the order is cancelled and I see how that would be in user interest. But once it passes that check it is good to go.
I've had orders cancelled for all sorts of reasons, mostly margin related. There is no way of rationalising a cleared order being untouched for 40 minutes in a way that wouldn't make the system unusable at any point in time.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:59:32
You correct. This therefore implies collusion between exchanges.
Don't forget, there was a very *very* long time for preparation here.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:01:12
The orders were not cancelled. 
And there was buying all the way down, just at an oddly throttled rate.
[edit] i should add to that that orders may have been cancelled due to that feature. Far more orders were issued than were cleared to move into the queue. 
Also market orders will fill be piecemeal. Never at any point did the buy side vaporise, there always was something even if small on the buy side. Given the torrent of orders (robots included) it should have eaten them up rapidly.
If there was just a small trail of tiny buys all the way down, I single handedly could have taken the price to the basement with the 'Kraken market Price Protection' active. Everytime I pressed the sell button I should have been able to move the price by 5% alone.
The rate of decent was 500 BTC per 5 minutes. That's 1.666 per second. ROTFL
A human could work that fast with prewritten tickets.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:47:26
Way to go with the thorough reading. I didn't get hurt. Nor was I playing a 'strategy'. 
What I did do is use my advanced computer knowledge to get ahead of the pack. I had nice big buy/sell buttons on my desktop that bypassed the web front end.
All I had to do was press buy and sell while watching the price. How is that a failing strategy? I didn't fall for the Stop order cascade that was a Long Squeeze in the morning, I saw that coming a mile away. I'm not naive enough to automate a strategy on such a day. Instead I automated the trade execution process and made the simple decisions in my mind at the time and that put me ahead of the other users timewise.
How can you chalk that up as naive or ineffective? The people I was talking to on Poliniex were jealous.
My so called diatribe at the end was a discussion that any proper experiment ends with. I guess I could have included nice underlined section headings for you. So lets just assume then you are not scientifically educated.
No, I and mosts others understand there are robots trading. in fact, everyone does. And no, we all do not just assume the exchanges are corrupt and rife with insider trading. It is a short sighted business model and unnecessary to earn large profits. Reputation is everything for an exchange.
And if you really must bring it up, asshole, I am smarter than *you*.
Risking one's own assets to run up the price and trigger stops is fair play. Replaying the sequence of orders, or just redirecting them to the trash can in order to fake the supply/demand is not.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:46:40

Yes, I have been silent for quite a long time. I wouldn't want to waste my time by getting into a bs contest with paid trolls and sock puppets unless I could make a case that I can back up.
And I would like to convince myself thoroughly first before getting into making accusations. I am a scientist, that means preparation, testing and data capture.
I've suspected this before but couldn't discount the fact that the webserver plausibly would be overwhelmed. So I prepared this time and bypassed the webfront end and set up tools to test the connectivity and system behavior during the time in question.
Yes that is amusing my defending the kraken interface. I am still pleased with the kraken interface in comparison with the other exchanges. Merging with cryptowatch was a really great move.
They ought to be content with running a straight up business, there is plenty of profit to be made. Any exchange that gets a reputation for security and consumer trust will corner the exchange market. I think Kraken has been skating by on the fact that it is not run out of China, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine or unknown location X. They shouldn't shit where they sleep and ruin the only thing they have going for them, a reputation to go by until proven otherwise (as they just did). Trust is something that is given freely. Earning it back later is next to impossible.
I think they fucked up this job on Friday and left too many giveaway signals. Once they coded up the filter for the orders, they wouldn't really know how it would play out live in terms of time. I doubt they anticipated they would need to artificially control the price for 40+ minutes. Smoking gun with a burning cherry on top.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:19:49
I fully agree. Bitcoin is also beyond any one state anyway.
But there are various types of regulation. I am not talking about Fed style market and economic regulation.
I am talking about consumer protection regulation. For example, in countries that allow gambling, bookies are regulated. Online gambling has to be provably fair and audit-able.
That's the kind of regulation I am referring to. I'm sure it doesn't fall under the SEC's remit, something more like the bureau for consumer protection and fraud or whatever such agency in country x, y, z that hosts the exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:43:04
All valid points.
My view of the YoY price growth is based on the positive news and continued proliferation of Bitcoin use.
But I think the clear manipulation by the exchange(s?) on Friday is something new the community needs to process and absorb.
Sure there was pricing in that occurred though was it for acceptance or rejection? I'd go with 50-50 as the price moved to the midpoint of the long term channel we are in. As in it nailed it deadly at the midpoint.
My strong view is that the current price is not valid. The market did not get the chance to show it's opinion of the rejection. Not only that, the market also needs to show it's opinion of the exchange corruption. That's a double whammy. If the price is rigged, then the value is either unknown or extremely low.
I think the buying of the last couple of days is people trying to recoup the BTC they just got swindled out of. Now this is pruely conjecture, but let's say most margin orders were tossed in the garbage and basic BTC sell orders were funnelled into a insider front running game. That would mean the sellers were simply relieved of their bitcoin and are since buying them back because they are falling for the propaganda that Bitcoin weathered the storm surprisingly well (it didn't in reality).
Bitcoin may be $10,000 by 2018. You are right, who knows?
But what if the community saw that all of the exchanges are colluding with whales and gaming everyone criminally. If trading suddenly came to a grinding halt due to consumers mistrust then would Bitcoin be $10,000 in 2018? No. certainly not. What about 2022? Well who the hell knows? If a legitimate and consumer regulated exchange came forward out of the ashes, then sure yeah 10,000 in 2022. Who knows. 
Whatever the road is, it must a be viable one. Eggs will have to be broken. I see the road as being a very long one if it is ever successful if currently it is a just a playground for criminals. There is a lot of talk about Bitcoin being anti big money, anti-establishment, anti-wallstreet etc. Does anyone really think wallstreet's biggest crooks are not using Bitcoin as their toy plaything? I don't believe that is enough to derail the Bitcoin premise or long term success. But if the majority of the exchanges are included in that group of criminal element, that is one hell of a serious problem that must be overcome before Bitcoin goes any further in it's evolution.
I have no faith in the validity of todays price. I am bracing for the second shoe to drop. There is way too much 'yay Bitcoin' over the last few days.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:09:39
I suppose I am rather mixing up my accusations of corruption and my view of Bitcoins growth model. Should be separate threads.
I think they are connected though. I read it some time ago, and am inclined to agree that Bitcoin has to go through a series of phases to grow. The early one being a tradeable asset. But as more people enter the market and volatility decreases, it will become less interesting to traders. At the point it moves into phases of digital gold, global reserve, or usable currency (whichever one of those ends up being the case).
I can't see it surviving the trading phase (which it is still in) if the market is rigged by a minority and that becomes known and not thwarted.
Don't forget the masses already believe Bitcoin is a scam akin to ponzi schemes if not exactly one. That stigma must be shed. Events such as what happened on Friday do seriously jeopardise Bitcoins survival. 
I don't think Bitcoin is going to survive on propaganda alone. The koolaid we are all supposed to have drank this last few days is "hey look how Bitcoin has matured and can handle bad news in a manner it hasn't before".... It was totally rigged! We are all in an echo chamber here. No non-Bitcoin people are even being exposed to this weeks dose of Koolaid. 
This means Bitcoin is in the worst possible state. The SEC rejection, (even if an ETF may very well have been bad for Bitcoin) was a significant mainstream rejection. Friday started with a long squeeze and ended with insider front running, price fixing and short squeezing.  It's highly likely the last few days are a set-up for a bull trap. Bitcoin should have had an epic drop. What one day in the past has the majority of the community been ready to take action at the same time? The next date in the calendar is tearing Bitcoin in two pieces. Most communications channels are censored and infested with paid shills. All those points together makes for a seriously bad situation. Much worse than anything Bitcoin has faced before.
These issues must combated. It's like AA. The community first has to accept it has a problem. Bitcoin is not be very nature Crimecoin. We all know that. But we all need to openly accept the significant level of criminality that exists in the community and we must route  them. Criminals look for short sighted gains. They also tend to leave behind a trail of collateral vandalism.

The implications then are staggering. I haven't really finished processing it, I'm not sure what that means for Bitcoins future.
The only thing I do know is that Bitcoin current value is Unknown.
I'm picturing a small number of shitheads on a roof top bar in Singapore laughing their heads off. The WinkleIdiots were probably there.

The evidence provided establishes that validated sell orders were not honoured. That's the only piece of evidence required to make an argument in conjunction with knowledge of how computer systems work.
The remaining evidence was the bizarre price behaviour at the time, we all saw it. Didn't you too observe that 30 minutes of buying at a price higher than anyone would have thought safe? It's the time that is the evidence and it is recorded on every chart on every charting site. The computers should have processed the math in seconds. The sells should have wiped out the large buying and then continued on down sharply beyond that level. 
It is not an assertion the orders were funnelled, that is a conclusion based on the observations of the evidence.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:03:10
I knew someone was going to say that and accuse me of FUD.
I am being sincere here. I want Bitcoin to survive, I want the market to be healthy.
I've been reading a really great book called "Reminiscence of a Stock Operator" written in the thirties. It was as true then as much as it is today. Anyway, one take away lesson is: don't be in the market when you are not sure of which way it is going.
That open short position i mentioned was modest in size. At the same time I purchased an equal amount of BTC. So I was evenly hedged either way. I closed the position last night and sold the BTC and they cancelled each other out. No skin off my back. I am not trying to push the market in any way that suits me. 
What suits me is a healthy market. Today the market is anything but healthy. I want to trade BTC but it just doesn't work if I am going to be gamed by the house. I agree with the SEC, there needs to be some oversight on these exchanges, they are running rackets. 
[edit] and FYI, I didn't get my face ripped off on Friday, I made a small profit. I should have made a very large profit.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:04:44
The point you are missing is the sell orders were not executed.
It doesnt matter if there were no buy orders, the sell orders then would just be placed in a queue until such time as there are. That is not realistic anyway. You think there is not at least one single limit order on the books to by 1 BTC for $1? Whatever the lowest order is, it would have been touched instantaneously. There were buy orders. There was some very very suspicious buy orders that got filled really really slowly.
At one point there was a buy order of multiple thousands up. It should have been eaten in seconds. Instead the record shows only an average of 500 BTC were processed for each 5 minutes. That doesn't stand up to analysis and is not in line with how computer systems work. Either the computer system would have rectified the buy/order tables in mere seconds (given there were buying orders at an oddly high level), or the price would have dropped like a stone. Neither of those two things happened.
No possible way should there be sell orders still in the queue that were queued in the first 6 minutes after the price began to rally. That make no sense whatsoever. The buying queue at that point would have overpowered the sell queue and pushed it back based on volume. Just like your point about no orders existing going down, it works both ways up and down, that is what moves the price.
If orders put in the queue in the first 5 minutes were not consumed by the advancing buys 40 minutes later, then every single sell order placed for the following initial 35 minutes would still be working through the queue now as we speak and any buy orders placed after an hour should be processed some time this coming Friday. Obviously people would have cancelled their orders once the conveniently sluggish web interface permitted them, the point is modern computers do no work that slowly wich such simple math. Not anywhere near that slowly.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:53:17
You are talking about a 'limit order'. It behaves as you describe.
A 'market order' will take the best price offered in any quantity and continue to eat through the opposite side until 'exhausted/ extinguished'.
At no point during the event was the buy side void of orders.
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:17:14
Oh the market cares alright, the exchanges are rigged. Kraken denied my short selling orders (one's that got through the network into the placed order system).
The drop should have been massive. They just permitted the sell orders they could fill presumably by themselves at 1000 euro, then put the rest on ice in limbo, ready to be freed when the buy starts.
Massive inside job. Had I lost any money I'd be pissed. After watching the events of yesterday closely, I can see now just how corrupt the market is. It's a fake market designed to squeeze positions.

When you do get online the price will be higher than it is now.

'If we hit 1000'? sure, but I think that is hocus pocus surrounding whole numbers. It may play around there just for the hell of it but it is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. That figure also lines up with a recent fib retracement line, though one I don't believe is valid. let me explain:
Bitcoin is rising in value for very good reasons. It isn't going to stop as we are still in the early adopter days (it is the 'buy it all quietly phase'). It is now proliferating quickly in developing nations. By how much? Well that is impossible to sample. It has been expected it would in these countries before 1st world nations. The thing is, 1st world currencies are so much stronger than the developing nations that the amount they are using is low compared to the amount being traded (in fiat measures). Bitcoins true growth is being overshadowed. Though it is fair to assume there, and everywhere, the proliferation follows a typical nonlinear growth model.
Bitcoin is being accepted. Slowly? Quickly? Time is abstract so whos to say if it is fast or slow. I do think it could be much faster.
So what is stopping it? I believe it is the trading. The trading isn't popping it up, it is fact suppressing the price. Why? Because more proffits can be made selling at peaks and buying up dips. Furthermore it can be shorted so profit is made on the way down too. It's a matter of timing. But if we took trading out of the equation (in a fantasy reality), then I think it would just simply go up and up until everyone has some and it's true value is found after some oscillation (crypto competition aside). The fact that you can expect a price drop after a bull run encourages people to think they can buy later. Also, there is a lot of short time frame trading volume, which gives the impression of high availability. If there was no trading, there would be no later. Trading, is suppressing the price. Trading benefits from crashes.
People keep attributing these rises and falls to real life events. But if you look at the major trends, there are very clear Fibonacci technicals being used, and then various indicators being tracked over shorter time frames.
Why? 
Well why not? Is it hocus pocus? Is it a self fulfilling prophesy? Well that is a pretty abstract debate. Mostly yes. Are underlying theories still valid at least? Yes, Fib models growth. But really it's robots trading robots, and others trying their best to compete. It works in the gambling sense b/c not everyone is following the same major trend lines.
Also, some of these trend lines maybe an expression of the behaviour of some other system that is connected. Maybe the major Bitcoin technicals are a measure of the state of the entire global financial system. Which you would expect to collapse following a pattern. Maybe some whales just agreed upon them. Maybe (likely) one trend is a composition of other trends). Maybe this, maybe that. Ultimately it doesn't matter. Valid or not, the trading will continue on autopilot, you can be sure of that.
Regarding the post mid-2015 upward trend, it looks clear to me we are on a rising channel. It is interesting to look at the pitch fork channel. It has taken me a long time to see it but it really puts the mike Hearn and Bitfinex into context. They occurred at significant Chanel transition points, one's where driving the price down was favoured, as it is favoured by traders.
The interesting thing is when we consider the fact that everyone trading is using different major key points to build trends. I don't think todays start of a new rise had as much to do with recent fib retracement as it has with other trends. They just line up together.
My rational is that we  came short on the last top. Check out the figure I'll attach at the end. If you were watching you'd have seen a lot of people sell out on the peak to peak linear extension from the previous two tops. Only to then watch it continue to rise in the log() space. Where did that line come from? From flawed technical anaylsis. Sure, its all hocus pocus, but still flawed hocus pocus. The source of the line includes March 09 2015. That point is part of the prior long term decline. The first legitimate rising peak was Grexit.
If you look at it that way, the November 2015 chinese trading bot overshot the mark. the market later corrected it in the following December. Which means, the target was ~1267 if this last event was truly the peak. Methinks that was not the true peak. It started to early. It did top out at the interior channel barrier. It was a premature ejaculation. It was a result of an echo of Bitfinex still existing in the long term integrals. And as such, we went right back down to the bottom. Which in hocus pocus terms is a healthy thing following a premature rush and bounce of the interior channel. Today we just crossed back into the interior zone, but this time on the rising end..
Some of the odd conflict in long term vrs shorter terms signals is a result of the bitfinex crash. It was well timed as a lot of signals were saying buy. As it is not that far behind us, some of the larger windows of values still remember it and perturbations can still be felt. They will roll off soon.
So I don't think we missed the peak. January 4-5 never was going to hit the top, that phoney line including March 2015 was a fools target. Therefore all the fib retracements down from that point are going to be passed, they aren't valid. It has nothing to do with them, 1000 or anything else. We just got out of spending a long time in the lower band of the pitch fork channel, which is a strong base aside from the recent premature departure attempt.
We are going to a minimum of 1400, and we are going to go there fast. Likely 1500 as it is a prettier number and a more realistic approach velocity inline with December 2015. The slower it goes, the higher it will go? Why? Because it's being pumped? They will say so. There is going to be some real world event? They will say it was Trump. Because of the hocus pocus lines? Well no and yes. Yes because it wants to go up as aggressively as possible. The world has waited a long time for this currency and everyone wants one regardless of whether they know it or not. What is going to happen at the peak is when the aggressive short selling drives it the other way. Bitcoin isn't a balloon being blown up, it's a hungry dog rarely being let of it's leash.
I'm all in to 1499 where I'll sell to an arbitrage robot.

"Zhao first entered the bitcoin market in 2013 with 10 million yuan in initial investment. And soon 10 million yuan turned out to be 100 million yuan within a year. However, the overoptimism and misjudgement shortly led him to open heavily leveraged positions. As a result, Zhao found himself 60 million yuan indebted to his friends after losing 9,000 bitcoins in a single day in February 2014. "

Fib retracement says ~955 but I'd say that's short sighted. Even 1000 is too. There is enough stabilisation at ~910. 
1070 is the target and that just puts it at a long term healthy figure and it will be time for a Mike Hearn or a Bitfinex.
I don't even think the last peak was as high as it could have tolerated, the previous peak to peak line in log() isn't consistent with the long term channel behaviour. So that rather takes the validity out of the fib ret bounds.
Personally I think Bitcoin at this point is just afraid of it's own shadow. It's ready to go to the next order of magnitude. The public WILL take notice and it won't really matter much if someone yells fire in the theater this time, it's getting a little boy-who-cried-wolf and the sell-buy game is going to be played out.

I have been reading all you posts. You seem like you know a thing or two about investment and market games and stuff. Serious question here...
I am curious.. could you explain this trajectory to zero? We've all heard that a lot of the people who 'don't believe in Bitcoin’s long term success' but that doesn't mean anything without an explanation. How do we go to zero?
I don't believe in creepy old Mr Burns types' ability to understand or recognise the significance of such new technologies. They created a rigged system where they get to make up their own money. They are so used to getting what they want by paying for corruption or buying armies. It won't last, it is unsustainable. They basically 51% attacked the global economy a long time ago and that is only recently being understood by the majority. I seriously think they are now just fat and lazy and don't have a clue anymore, they think the game will go on forever. It won't... i digress.
I get the whole shorting angle. There is a new game in town and the sharks are going to wan't to play some of the old games and con people into losing their life savings. But how does that take us to zero? Shorts have to be closed with buy orders yes? So that inherently locks in buying pressure for the future?
Zero is total loss of faith. You'd have to crush the Bitcoin premise. No one has done that yet. The game theory has been discussed in this forum for years. Please explain we go to zero.
We hear whispers of mysterious wealthy players that are going to come out of the darkness and kill Bitcoin with all their munies. And then what? Yay cheap Bitcoin.
I get the whole "wall street dicks and banksters are going to play their counter-intuitive manipulation games and send the price downward". That is specifically what is happening right now as we speak. That has been Bitcoin of the last few months. But then what? We are supposed to believe price manipulation is a new thing? China manipulated the price southward so many times it just got boring and didn’t work anymore. The last thing they did was arguably the worst thing they every did and it is was just a ‘lolz China -8%’ kinda day. The banks saying Bitcoin is not viable and Mad Money saying it is a no buy and the CNN hit pieces too are just going wear off on the general public inevitably.
Bitcoin will continue to proliferate. Bitcoin will keep spreading into the cracks. Every fantasy-reserve economy that crumbles under its own lies will be eaten by Bitcoin. If Bitcoin gets too boring for crime street because they've finished gaming a whole new generation of people that earn money by doing something constructive and move on to something else, then what? If Bitcoin is worth $5 then what? The poor start using it. Africa would embrace it. It would become far more accessible to the majority of the worlds population. Labor and resource based economies would give it's true purpose. 
Hypothetically, if Africa alone fully embraced Bitcoin, every 57 people would have to share 1 Bitcoin for their entire economic activity. The average African annual income is say $700 give or take a few censuses. If Bitcoin represented that economic activity alone, each coin would be representing $40,000 of trade for the year. It is an arm chairy example that doesn't take into account things like use in global trade but it's not like they import a lot of shit chinese plastic stuff anyway, they poor already. The point being... Bitcoin just has to find some foothold somewhere to have tremendous value. It will find that foothold the same way water flows downhill. The dumbest thing the worlds wealthy could do is sit back and let Bitcoin proliferate amongst worlds poorest first.
We all heard through 2015 that the big bad scary bank man is coming to kill our little toy. How??? You can't just say it will be shorted to death and leave it at that. It won't die. All that can be done is it can be shorted to an absolutely amazing buying opportunity. You know what would be awesome? Being able to relive 2015 and buying in heavy at $200. That just isn’t going to happen, the ship has sailed.
All those net shorts have to be covered. Otherwise it is just an attempt to kill Bitcoin with overwhelming wealth (as a write-off). A plausible attack vector to be attempt and potentially disastrous for those whole try. It is amusing to think of the counterfeit monetary system attempting to destroy the finite supply monetary system by out-counterfeiting it.
It is like the "we are are all going to cash in for lambos fallacy". It just doesn't work like that. If everyone tries to sell out for dollhairs when Bitcoin is traded at $500,000 the price will go off a cliff and the only one getting a lambo is the one who bailed first. We all get lambos if you can pay for lambos in Bitcoin. You get a lambo with Bitcoin when the price tag on the windscreen says X satoshi. That is the direction we are going in. All these heavy shorters are just playing a game of chicken where trying to time a trough is just as dumb as trying to time a peak.
"These silly internet tokens are worth less than Canadian Tire money, the whole thing is stupid". I've heard it all before, it sounds just like "This email thing is stupid, why would anyone want to have a mailbox on someone else’s computer somewhere?" or my favorite "why would anyone want to be walking around outside talking on a telephone? Besides. it's just so cumbersome". These are the things that were said. As in, said on the nightly news and for a time was the majority opinion. That pointless ethereal not-private mail is now in your pocket inside your obnoxious cumbersome micro-mainframe computer radio thingy, and soon, it is going to be mining your crypto too. How zero???????
I don’t want to hear about Myspace. How zero?
And what’s with all this new avenues to short Bitcoin talk. There are already avenues to short Bitcoin, always have been. You want to short Bitcoin? Use whatever avenues are available. Open up a corporate tier account on Kraken and have it. Take it from someone who’s been there.. shorting Bitcoin can be the dumbest thing you ever thought of doing. But if you mean hedge funds and the like are looking for the government to give them permission to use peoples retirement and savings plans as collateral in a gambit to corner then market so what? We are supposed to believe that the value of Bitcoin is going to stagnate until these clowns can get on stage?
All I see is the bribed talking heads on the TV stalling for time while the banks have their software slave army rewrite their front and back end systems to integrate Bitcoin as they finally have caught up to reality and have seen the only best angle they have is to get into the custody market (as fucking ironic as that is). And this is a race between competing banks that are already as close to bankrupture as they can possibly and fraudulently get. Just you watch as some career criminal gets on TV and declares “we have solved everything by taking the complexity out of Bitcoin and that they are now open for business”. Until then, they just keep buying Bitcoin everytime some sucker opens yet another short position. Shorting at this point is about as bright as going long at 16k.
I totally get there is a desire to short in really massive way and to do it with familiar faces instead of these new dorks and their scary internets. But that isn’t going to happen until we get to the next frenzy peak and they lock in all them juice gains.
How zero?

Sorry buddy but using words like crazy and stupid while being exceptionally ignorant really doesn't come across AS anything other than stupid.
The december runup was not fuelled by mass retail purchase. Everyone was talking about BTC but the vast majority could not figure out how to buy bitcoin. Those that did overwhelmed the exchanges ability to verify accounts. An insignificant portion managed to drop at most a tier 1 amount into BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:31:31
Check out RSI... way oversold on every time sample rate.
Not that technicals independently guide price but they guide robots.
My take on the current climate:
Crazy amount of FUD. Crypto is not going anywhere and  big money wants to play. For that they need regulatory approval. Banks also want in.
Here's the catch, they need time for that. Regulatory bodies need time to debate and draft documents. Banks need their software slave army to make their systems compatible. Until then they don't want to see price growth so they are doing their best to spread misinformation and FUD.
December 2017 was just a media test case to see what kind of frenzy can be generated. Conclusion: unprecedented frenzy level. So that was shut down to prepare for the next one.
There is all this talk about selling. selling selling selling selling. No one is selling anymore. The trivial amount of retail investor capital that came in was not as much as the hype suggested. Most people didn't know how to or couldn't get through the account registration bottle neck. Whatever portion of those that cut their loses have already done so long ago.
Whatever 'selling' is occuring is shorting. At this point that is all just paper proffit. The only way to realise the profit is to close the positions with a buy order. There is a tremendous amount of short paper proffit currently. It is not all going to be realised as as soon as the first big player to flinch in this game of chicken closes their position we are going to see things jump fast and the whole domino cascade occurs.
Continuing to short this further is just mental. It is no different than going hyper-bull long at 19k.
Bitcoin was doing just fine without the banks or the regulators. The only thing that has changed since then is their FUD and a torrent of bullish fundamentals, tech evolution and adoption.
In my view, waiting out for 5k is just chart reading hocus pocus. I'm eating popcorn waiting for the first whale who is delusional and high from staring at paper proffits to wake up and realise "oh crap! I forgot I actually have to close this, and doing so when the bear pressure has dried up is the worst time for it." and closes out before the big green super dong candle suddenly appears.

Here is what I have learned over the years... if it really looks like it is going down, everyone thinks it is going down, and a ton of people open short positions... then it is going down.
However, it will shortly go up before going down. If there are no long orders on the books how do big players get the large market they need for going short? Liquidate the existing short positions. This causes a cascade of automated orders to sell into. For an even higher opening price to boot.
Also almost every historical major run up was precipitated by a very quick extreme plunge. Same thing as abouve but a long squeeze. Also a true test of faith.

So you just unilaterally decided on behalf of the continent of Africa that they are not going to use bitcoin????? That is radically offensive, abusive and audacious.
One of the fundamental premises of bitcoin is that it is a currency with fundamentally different economics.

The main criticism I read is that LTC doesn't need the scaling as badly.  Obviously that can change in a flash. I think a lot of people don't take seriously just how fast the community will move to a new coin. It would be a shockingly fast move. Just as many miner actions debates always end in the conclusion that the miners will go where the money goes. Well that is just as much true for user choices of coin. Sure they want utility, but given the basic use cases such as store of value and medium for trade and they will jump ship in the blink of an eye as long as it doesn't suffer from some the blatant scams properties most of the shitcoins do.
People are very fed up with the current centralisation of mining. Does not the adoption of litecoin nuke that problem for at least the near future?
Ironically, bitcoin may start copying litecoin.
Bitcoin may just have a new problem: "what do I have over litecoin really?"
This just may be the kick in the pant that bitcoin needs.

Well then aside from your pointless ad hominem attacks, you agree with me in the source of corruption. If you must make a point of it, I posses a classical education, 2 technologist diplomas, a summa cume laude in computer engineering and a master of science in autonomous robotics. I eat textbooks for breakfast.
Regarding then giving the disenfranchised masses of this earth money. It has already been conclusively shown and proven (repeatedly in different countries) that giving poor money as handout does in fact work. It directly helps people to better themselves which they certainly do do. I would think it is directly related to Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the lower levels being distinct from higher concerns. If you give an american lower middle class 21 year old 20k to go to university without strings attached there's no saying where the money will go. If you give someone who is truely poor 1k they will spend it on bettering their condition. A money solution is a real viable solution as it transfers the power to the people (in the bitcoin context).
A settlement solution is a maybe hopeful thing. There are already settlement layers in existence. It is what happens on the other layers that is the problem. If there is a way to obfuscate the financial crime it will be exploited. Our existing systems are supposed to be regulated. But that doesn't stop wall street from leveraging the worlds economy with toxic assets and the Pentagon saying "oops, we just lost 100 Trillion in the Black Ops rabbit whole". Private sidechains could exacerbate corruption. At a minimum maintain the status quo.

Is that sarcasm? Bitcoin current value is 100% speculation based on the assumption of future global proliferation. Without such proliferation bitcoin is worthless.

Wow what a fantastic declaration. Yes sir Mr Bitcoin Boss.
So I guess we'll just conveniently ignore that fact that bitcoin **was** meant for such type of transactions.
What if I don't want to see bitcoin as expensive paper? What if I object to this paper supplier burning most of the paper and then declaring scarcity and jacking up the price?
You comment is explaining what segwit and LN is. I am trying to address the economic fundamentals of value basis and growth. And would very much like it if someone could provide me with a link to core's roadmap that addresses the global economic growth model.
And i'm cool with analogies. To me, post-its sound ridiculous. To me shifting the transactions to post-its sounds exactly like the existing banking paradigm where banks have a bunch of private ledgers that reference each other in some obfuscating spaghetti network that noone could possibly audit. One that is a closed loop positive gain system (absurdly unstable).
Furthermore, the Post-it manufacturer then becomes king. What happens to the A4 sheet when it's full area is covered with an unknown depth of Post-its with Post-its tacked on to Post-its such that it is endless spaghetti and the Post-its supplier is standing there saying "no, fuck off, no Post-its for you".

The nations central banks and meta players are the *most* politically corrupt. You have everything backwards. These people are looking for tools to help the disenfranchised? ROTFL They want tools to obfuscate their transactions.
I understand how money and economics works quite well thank you. The vast majority of modern economic thought begins with the assumption of certain premises being established and therefore are not discussed further. Such as the assumption of fractional reserves.


Bitcoin strikes at the heart of assumptions that form a basis for such eco-bable. So you can take the capitalist economics textbook and throw it in the archive cellar now as what is written in section 1, chapter 1 is no longer valid. 
When you take away the 'meta players' tool to invent unlimited sums of money for themselves you end a century of economic crime and abuse. You tear down the world's largest and longest most pervasive and yet most overlooked pyramid scheme.
We are now beyond the likes of Jon Nash. He lived out his 86 years in an era of oligarchical economic dictatorship. 
Oh, and heres a poignant factoid:


A non-hijacked bitcoin has the best shot at becoming this so-called 'Ideal Money'.
Do you have anymore schizophrenics you'd like to randomly quote so we can muse over the subtle obscurities of a waning economic era?
Perhaps we could discuss the rantings of that hyper-delusional psycho-bitch Ayn Rand. At least her fantasies were somewhat more fundamental and her loathsome contempt for the lower classes clear and distinct. As a vehicle for discussion her isolation exposes the fact that sociology is an intrinsic component of economics. We might begin to see that today's oligarchs are so socially isolated that they have become blind to the world as it truly is as they can only see through Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's yellow glasses. They are crippled by the fear of sharing the ugly fate of the former Russian Tzars.


Somehow I think I should quote Isaac Isamov in reference to grand socio-economic revolution, but I don't want to assume you are well read. George Lucas will have to do.
Your assumptions demonstrate you don't understand the reality of the world you live in and how corruption works.

You are the one bringing up *giving* the poor in troubled nations a money solution versus *giving* their leaders a settlement solution. So yes I think pointing out what happens when you *give* poor people something is directly relevant versus pointing out what happens when you *give* the corrupt a double edged sword.
And no, I haven't made a case for the usefulness of settlement layers anywhere. I am aware of the pro side to it and the use cases, but in the context of todays discussion i have only brought up the clear risk and that scaling inclusively is more of a priority than some of the other topics de jour.
And no I am not being an arrogant idiot, I am being rational. Ad hominem is not an argument fuck wit.
Last time I checked one *listens* to a lecture. I don't know how one gets that backwards. But i guess you have as your claiming things I have not said so you must be listening to this page and making shit up in your own head.
And frankly if your writing is anything like the illogical last few posts of yours, it's an activity you should probably avoid.
Finally, I can't be bothered by you on this subject any longer, the next thing you your going to say is I am illogical (see computer engineering). You could have jsut stuck with the interesting bio on Nash and we could have discussed economics. I'd have gone on to say it's easier to make up computer digits than it is to print money.
But anyways... if you'd like to just go all the way with being an asshole, why not just meet me here -&gt;

I am curious.. how long have you been in the bitcoin space?
How many addresses are owned by Chinese? who knows.. that is one of the premises of sudo-anonymity.
How are you going to possibly find any trends in data when you have no idea of the sample density for your population?
Assuming you could differentiate between chinese and addresses and the rest of the world enough to identify characteristics that make them a world 'outlier' (which you can't), what possible connection is there to the chinese gov't? If you happen to find 100 addresses owned by random chinese businesses people, tech savvy corner shop owners, and basement dwelling nerds with faucets.. where is the link to the chinese gov't?
You are then going to use this giant leap of dot connecting to make a case for state strategic control??????

I could label two bottoms on your graph and point arrows that count impulses going up. It would mean just as much.
Though i agree on the near term bearish sentiment. I am not comfortable being long here until we properly touch down on support and the bearish pressure is drained out if the 1wk signals.
I want see a good strong hold at 7,200 and some aggressive buying. There was a chance for a short lived bull run but it didnt happen. In my mind that doubles down on the bear pressure.
Besides, it hasn't gotten quite bad enough yet with the fud. I want to see the blood on the streets before we can say it is time to go search of some fictional downward trendline.

Go to bitcoinwisdom, look at the moving averages behaviour during turn arouns at peaks and troughs. At any time scale on the turn it will toggle between the blue and oragne line. It is the most consistent thing in bitcoin. ALways happens.
Seriously have a look at 12h, 6h, 4h, 2h over the last week. Same pattern. Has happened throughout the entire history of bitcoin. Bots are driving the price, that is the algo they use on peaks and troughs. the price is going down within hours.
Then after it consolidates it will take a run at toggling on the 3d candles (back to about 11k).
I do enjoy the roller coaster guy meme. But only when it is well timed. When the price does turn around, you will see a sudden rush of buying and the price will go +10% in 5 minutes. It happens on the 3d candles. As we are still bearish, I wouldn't be surprised if we have to wait for the 1wk signals turn around this time. Until then, this is just day trading. target price for the next week is sub 9k.
When it really jumps up, please post roller coaster, its my favorite. :D

Bitcoin is backed by the tremendous capital that goes into mining and securing the network. Along with self-reinforcing game theory, a bunch of mathy stuff and the answer to a long standing trust problem.
You can copy-cat fork shitcoins all you want, they won't get mined seriously. Your argument is: "Bitcoin is worthless because Dogecoin exists?"
You Johnny Come Latelies are getting a little tiring in here.
One of the major premises of Bitcoin is that it can not be counterfeited or inflated at whim by a central authority. It is specifically the exact opposite of what you claim.

Todays whingers who bought at 20k are going to be next weeks whingers who bought at 10k.
There is still some more steam to let out. Price is just toggling between 1 day moving averages.
Needs more build up to go on a solid run (breaching 3 day moving averages next week).

The irony is absurd but most people are going to use banks.
This is why we are not seeing the established industry come down hard with all reasources against bitcoin. They have followed the game theory far enough to see the common idiot will want to bank their bitcoin and they will still have a business model.
They still have serious threat issues to grapple with. Upstart crypto banks could easily replace them. There are complex matters beyond jyst custody as well.
They are shitting on bitcoin currently as they need time to prepare. It is in their best interest to slow growth so they can have the software slave army rewrite their infrastructure to support bitcoin. Their opposition is a sudo-opposition. It is a fake oposition. Just watch them change their tune soon enough and begin selling bitcoin.
