You sound like this is pure speculation to you?
Are you buying bitcoins because you want dollars in the end?

@_date: 2016-01-31 17:27:39
Until 0% is possible, why not just make it 1% or 0.1%?

My thoughts exactly.
I really had higher thoughts about them, but no one seems to actually add anything but wild emotions to the discussion in there.
They must have had an invasion of stupid, because I clearly remember reading comments on there some years ago, and thought they were some clever geeks who knew their tech.
Now it seems like angry kids shouting at each other.
@_date: 2012-10-22 16:59:22

They do have a point in saying that the bitcoin currency itself could take a large blow from the MtGox attacks. If 1 hacker managed to get 500.000 Bitcoins, and just decided to sit on them for years, this hacker could at any time decide to crash the price of bitcoins at any time, after their value had risen.

Maybe bitcoins are of no use for you then.
Some people value the ability to "pay cash" via the internet internationally, with no chargeback issues and little fees.
Others don't want to trust institutions which put legal and moral (and immoral according to some) limitations on the use of their payment service. Paypal is notoriously known for this for example, and all credit card operators shut off WikiLeaks donations for example.
@_date: 2011-08-04 17:48:09
You comparing cash to credit cards.
You might as well ask yourself why you would want to use cash?

I don't know where you live, but shops here don't accept checks anymore here.
That being said, if you put in a trusted middle man, it could be "instant", and solve the problem.
Kind of like what VISA for example does today.
@_date: 2011-09-29 16:44:20
It has to be published somehow, somewhere in the world to count.
@_date: 2011-05-16 15:16:57
I see no reason why not. You can rephrase it, and ask yourself the question if legal action could be taken if the object of the scam was not bitcoins, but another online commodity with a certain value.
@_date: 2011-12-20 18:14:14
I'd prefer it to be stable, so I hope it settles again soon.
@_date: 2011-07-09 08:49:23
Some are, some aren't.
There are some people on the bitcoin forum who will buy your signature space for 0.1 BTC too for example, and those I have come across have been legit.
When in doubt, ask the community.
@_date: 2011-07-18 16:03:00
State your place of residence. If you are somewhere with lots of people, someone might want to sell them to you for cash money...
@_date: 2011-06-05 10:58:09
Just let us use VISA/Mastercard to buy BTC with.
And normal payout via bank transfer, but also an option to recieve it as a cheque in the mail.
@_date: 2011-08-06 21:57:09
I will hold on to mine for years and years, no matter what happens to the value.
If they go lower: Would be dumb to sell them, since I would gain little by selling, and lose a lot. I also still believe in bitcoins, so would be idiotic to sell.
If they go higher: It would be dumb to sell them, since if they actually start to gain trust again, the sky is the limit.
In other words, I would sell them if I needed to, which I don't.

Karma is a bitch ;)
@_date: 2011-07-01 18:23:32
Exactly, that doesn't mean anything really.
They have a confirmed phone line? LulzSec had 2 phone numbers you could reach them on, while they DDoS'd the CIA. That tells you how much a phone # is worth in terms of trust in that you are able to ID whoever is on the other end.
Address can also mean jack shit, office complexes, places that recieve mail for you, PO-boxes etc.
@_date: 2011-07-13 23:35:12
Some people confirmed payment I think...
@_date: 2011-08-07 07:58:24
Thing is, I don't think it is worth my time to buy and sell money.
I don't do this with other currencies, so no reason to do it with bitcoins either.
@_date: 2011-09-12 18:59:22
Why not do a bank transfer?

Good riddance!
Now stop trusting anonymous individuals with your money for crying out loud.
Hell, don't trust identified individuals with them either.
Trust yourself, people you have very good reasons to trust and trust companies registered in a real country, with real insurance and a physical address that is not a P/O box.
@_date: 2011-06-03 13:10:59
@_date: 2011-07-10 20:33:18
How would that work in a store though?
It takes a while for the confirmations to stack up, and would you just stand and linger in the shop while it confirms?
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:54:08
It's not *really* the Economist covering Bitcoin is it, since it's just a blog hosted by the Economist... Or am I wrong about how they use the term blog?
@_date: 2011-07-01 09:04:25
They still need to tell us the most vital information of all:
What type of company is Tradehill, where is it registered, how many funds do they have access to, who can vouch for them, are they even insured and how do we know they won't just suddenly take the money and run?
@_date: 2011-06-04 19:36:42

@_date: 2013-10-03 18:57:46
So if they have transferred the bitcoins to a gov controlled wallet (which I assume they have done), is it possible to guess what transaction(s) that is, and what adress the money currently is in?
Also, when the case is over, I suppose they will sell the bitcoins. I wonder how this will be done?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:47:32
You should just wait it out and see. Bitcoin is either worth nothing or a whole lot, anything in between is just wild guesses.
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:19:12

Why are we interested in convincing people it is not a ponzi scheme?
They are the ones missing out, and unlike a ponzi scheme, we do not need to "get new people in" all the time.
So as long as people who bother to educate themselves can make an informed decision, why do we care if people think it's a ponzi scheme?

The sites should not even allow those tiny amounts to be paid out.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:33:58
I guess it would allow clueless people to use BTC transfers, and give you insurance (something goes wrong, and it's WU's fault and they have to cover your losses).
Though I don't really see what they are able to offer other than acting as an intermediary/escrow and insurance against mistakes. But maybe that is enough.
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:02:17
I sure hope those initial developers, early adaptors, nerds and investors are all future billionaires.
I cannot think of people more deserving to be than them, and I an convinced they will manage these funds in the best interests of not only themselves but the internet and it's users at large.

Big players selling out massive stashes to the masses, that cause a temporary price drop = good.
100's or 1000's of individual bitcoin holders panicking and selling their coins en masse to a few big players who can keep their cool = bad.
What is actually happening I don't know, maybe neither right now.

This is an amazing service, and once businesses involved with for example IP find out how to use it, it will be a game changer.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:27:43
This goes even more for the current markets, where organized crime are well invested into everything everywhere.
Also, I highly doubt that many drug dealers, botnet operators or money launderers were early adopters. They all came along when bitcoin was already functioning and started using it like everyone else.

What if he sends money back, does that mean that he lied when he said it was a scam?
He'd be a liar if so, and it would actually be a scam, since it did not do what he promised 100% guaranteed. This would in fact make it a scam, since it turned out not to be a scam as promised. This makes it both a scam and not a scam at the same time.
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:21:47

Find out what you want right now, and if possible, then purchase it using bitcoins, save the rest.
No need to convert to $ or other currency, when all you would do is spend them.
In short: Purchase things with BTC, and save BTC. Forget about the dollars.
