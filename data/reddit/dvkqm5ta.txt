Is it working okay for you? I've had every transaction in the last two weeks fail on Wallet of Satoshi. Eclair is going okay though.

Yeah, they're garbage.

Bisq is crap.

Any with decent number of people willing to buy in person for cash? I tried a few of these and they're crap. I guess the market vacuum will be filled soon.

It's not even the liquidity problem. The interfaces are garbage. We need a specialised in-person cash-trading and bitcoin site. I wish that I had the wherewithal to make it!

I paid it! I just paid my dollar forward. Cool!

No announcement. What jerks.

Bron managed it. He got Highgarden.

It worked. Cheers!

It's not about excluding criminals from the financial system; it's about intimidating taxpayers.

Funny meme! Hey, why do so many people have their knickers in a knot about Wright lying about being Satoshi. Yes, he's a bullshit artist but there's plenty of those around. I'm surprised that he isn't just ignored.

Does this apply to BitMEX? I think that they're solid.

I sold all of my gold too and for the same reasons.

You're anti-shorting our anti-leverage? Or anti-trading?

Have you got the capital gains liability covered?
