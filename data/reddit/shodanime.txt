These were the first asic chip mining systems back in 2013. I have no idea why people are still selling these for so much
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:18:15
Its a good feeling isn’t it? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:11:59
Its really bad. I saw this one ico called date coin. It was a coin for dating and another one called deez nuts coins. Like wtf man lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:04:58
Alot of the Facebook crypto currency ads are scams 
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:30:43
Thank you for your sacrifice。
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:02:21
Exactly I dont know why people keep going to Amazon.com and eBay. I got my nano s in 4 days from their site 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:02:06
I just hope they do a better job than Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:11:40
Nope, it would be placing it at my store. How load is this thing? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:45:53
I did the same. We need to help the network
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:43:58
What laser do you have?  Nice hope i win
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:26:37
I am about to start a node to help the network. I’m also interested in this question. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:26
Well, i am ok with DL and last 4 ssn. But bitstamp ask for the full SSN. I dont feel that crypto is where i can feel comfortable giving out my full SSN
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:53:48
Bruh i bought at 10k, 11k and my biggest sum of money was about at 17k�� i saw it drop from 17k and back like 6 times this month. Just hodl and wait no reason to sell at a lost. Btc is not going to die. We just need to wait for the fees to drop so we can see a profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:52:51
Im with this guy
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:53:58
Never sell always hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:24:27
God thats load, is it like running a Air compressor? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:55:01
Well if you get a S9. It should make you about .8 bitcoins a year. Something recently i learned that bitcoins block are not locked in at 12.5 per block. Thats just the based reward. On slush pool there has been 24btc block rewards because of the network fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:17:14
I can see that happening than fail! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:20:42
Unless you buy a s9 is not worth for you to mine btc. Just try to find some easy alt coins 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:16:15
Anything is better than coinbase. goldman sachs is thinking about opening one in june. Coinbase needs some actual competition. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:01:04
Its pricy but soo worth it. Get a nano s. But ya try to find yourself a segwit wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:42:26
Exodus is a cool wallet but its really expensive to use 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:08:22
I can see that happening in 2020. After more people understand the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:50:05
I would say yes. But mining requires a serious amount of an investment to even be profitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:50:44
Add some cookies to this cake. 
Just wait for the next ride 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:12:17
You can buy it right from their website. I got my in 4 days i live in nj
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:44:50
Better than a Lambo 
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:05:32
People who get IRS Letters is it because they sold? Over a certain amount?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:47:57
I was going to come here to say the same thing lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:56:42
We all been there. I’m still waiting to break even with my btc I bought at 16k.
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:36:25
I have a question. How do you plug these in. Like what do you use to plug them into the wall. I’m trying to set up a 2nd one but I don’t want to burn it out with out property connecting them to the wall 
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:13:07
Thank you for the information. The thing is I’m at a mall. My power is central. So I will not have access to be able to install a 220 outlet. One works fine I’ve been using a 14ga. I’ve been ruining that for about an year already. But I will look for a electrician. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:57:27
I might be crazy enough to buy the s9 instead. Which   Cost about 3k. I hope this would work for me. The cost to just buy 1BTC is just so expensive. 
I do get were you are coming from. It just seem a safer bet to buy a miner than just buying the bitcoin. For example I got my 50gh for about $300 at the time but if I just bought the 1BTC Which $500 at the time. I would had made a lot more money. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 02:17:26
I just hope it stays here. For a bit longer. Until I get 1 BTC.  I’m a shy under 1 btc
@_date: 2019-04-29 19:09:30
Ya that would be nice :)
@_date: 2019-04-01 11:38:50
Man, you guys. Joke really goes over your head �� 
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:18:29
What kind of surge protectors are using
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:47:49
If I remember a while back I actually used btc to pay for my accommodation but you were never were able to use it for flight tickets tho. Just hotel rooms
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:04:26
Coinbase is much better now than it was in December. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:59:35
Well,  i started in looking into btc back in 2013. When it crashed i lost all hope. I made about 2k form the little mining i did. But now i am kinda hoping this happens again. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:01
Miners care about how much btc we can get. With everyone selling and buying. The blocks should get larger regardless of the price where btc is at. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:55:40
Hehe same 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:08:14
I use NT password for password removal. Will only work with windows 7 or older. It works really well. I been using this software for years. But be careful its linux making changes to your windows file. I would recommend to ghost/clone the drive to another one before using this software. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:57:18
I think this is the only reason they as now accepting cash
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:46:48
Best one yet.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:24:20
I was hoping it would stay a bit longer on the sell price. But I guess my bois we’re going to the moon!!
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:43:39
I’m taking this imaginary money to the ground or to the moon. Looks like my bois we’re going to the moon. 
But ya this been happening for years. I’ve been into btc since 2013 never  bought at the time because I couldn’t afford it. Saw it go from 500 to 1 k than crash to about $200 I also thought btc was dead at the time.  After seeing this happening time and time again I’m a hard believer in btc.  Made a small amount profits last bull run used my btc to pay for my Philippines and japan trip through Expedia.
