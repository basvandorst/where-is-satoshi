I think you completely missed my point if you're trying to tell me about the same thing I was talking about.. Also, please don't compare regular currencies to cryptocurrencies.

Guys, quick, someone buy a bitcoin for 100k so we can all become millionaires

What I meant was.. A corporation or government can make it impossible for you folks to mine anything. I actually run bitcoin cracker overnight time by time, this night again I hijacked a bitcoin wallet, this thing will become so fast and easy on QC that none of your wallets will be safe.

ECDSA is used to sign transactions, not to keep wallets safe against cracking.

Even bitcoin wikipedia says that bitcoin security will get obsolete by 2030. But hey, I'm just an IT guy who works in security, what do I know. Only spent few hours researching cryptocurrencies, decided to invest into something else and in half a year turned in 250x profit by making one purchase.

It has to do with the fact, that recently there was a big boom of media, forums and basically everyone talking about bitcoins, which increased demand, which made exchange points raise bitcoin's price. This is now getting in the past. Just like it was with the silkroad takedown, when bitcoin became famous, it hit an all-time record of ~1000$, after the media boom stopped, it dropped to ~350$ and stayed there for a long time.

In case you didn't know who controls the bitcoin's price - it's exchange points. Whenever there's an increase in demand (hype), their algoritm (based on volume) automatically increases the price. Whenever there's less people buying bitcoins than 1 minute ago, bitcoin price starts falling.

While the number is correct, the security behind bitcoin will get obsolete way before that and people will move to more secure cryptocurrencies.
EDIT: ITT Bitcoin fanboys who don't know anything about security and cryptography downvote anyone who speaks against it. Let's be real here - it was one of the first cryptocurrencies out there, it was not made with QC in mind, let alone this popularity. Let's also not forget it uses SHA-256, which can be weakened by using grovers algorithm, opening a possibility to crack any of your wallets by using a QC super computer. Don't really want to argue with bitcoin fanboys here, but if anyone here actually has any knowledge on this topic, you might find [this]( analysis interesting. Even if QC somehow fails to crack SHA-256 (which is doubtable), it will bring bitcoin to knees by being able to mine bitcoins 17 billion times more efficient.
Hi from the next big profit.

Wait, so you are illegal..here?

Back then withdrawing only $10 to real life money/paypal/visa was almost impossible. Either way you find a buyer, or pay big fees.

Yes, a lot. There are currently 100GB free of 2TB and it has been formatted repeatedly.
