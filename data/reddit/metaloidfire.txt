There was also the huge deal in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada with bitcoin so show him that article. It's gonna be a gamble but if he prevents someone from completing an assignment there has to be a way to bring this up to a different figure with a more reasonable attitude towards those discussions. There is always someone higher up than him that will listen. I had a teacher like that when I was in high school. He wouldn't give me a proper grade on my assignment because he found it "too controversial" so I talked to my principle and got another teacher to look at it and she loved the message I brought with my project. 
*The project was about suicide prevention and I had an image of a girl holding a gun up to her head and tears running down her face with a caption about it being someone close to you*

Show him r/bitcoin and explain to him in a calm manner that it's just a way to scare people into selling bitcoin and discrediting the hard work that is put into making cryptocurrency a legitimate currency in the eyes of the world, people like him sound like he can be talked to... it's just how you approach it and give out details that would make sense to anybody.

Didn't know the wild Rose had a beer like that. Is that beer a limited time only or will I be able to pick one up after stampede is over?
