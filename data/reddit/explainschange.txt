That would be foolish. The linux partition can access the windows one and vice versa. Don't expect that to save you.

You can't really protect against client side malware unless you have a hardware token like the Trezor, which does do authorization of the transactions. If you have malware on your computer, it's end game no matter what though, if it can't directly steal your funds it can just replace the addresses you see on the fly and trick you into spending to them instead.

NXT is largely bullshit, closed source, and vulnerable to attacks that they haven't been able to explain how they avoided.
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:43:10
Doesn't have key stretching like the main password. Much easier to crack. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:34:25
You can be most assured that is wrong. That's a tough password, but not impossible.
@_date: 2014-02-01 14:12:12
Depends on the country of origin. In this case, that statement stands perfectly on it's own.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:22:17


A little. It's just a wide avenue of attack. They could go in via your dropbox, your email, or nab them from a public computer. All of these bypass the two factor authentication the same way and are likely more vulnerable than your storage of the wab app itself.


Well, yes. If you choose a bad password / don't enable 2FA imidiately, somebody can waltz past and find your weak wallet and crack the password. Due to the keys in the wallet never changing, from there on out they can steam from any address in the wallet at that time.


The second password is some security, but ironically it's faster to attack than the main password. 


I don't use web wallets, I prefer to do security on my own. It's a tradeoff for convenience and privacy.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:02:25
Nope. Chances are it's probably custom enough that if virus software doesn't pick it up, you won't either. Time to wipe your drives, rebuild, change every password for every website and service you use. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:43:24
It's also totally wrong. It tells me Password1 is strong.

If you use the wallet backup to email system, most certainly. A lot of email is sent in cleartext especially.

Part of the wallet file too, nothing to do with blockchain.info's servers.
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:21:04


Potentially. 


It depends on the software, which is why you are getting mixed responses. Backups made by Bitcoin-QT do go out of date, funds are moved around to new addresses every time you make a transaction to protect your privacy. Blockchain.info does not do this, and uses a static private key. If you don't change the private keys storing the funds, then the backup never goes stale. 


Yep. Once the private keys are compromised by somebody, there's nothing you can do but get your funds to a new address as quickly as possible. 


It's a difficult situation with no easy answer. Objectively coinbase is more secure with their true 2FA, but you do need to trust that they won't suddenly disappear. I don't think it's at all a risk given the funding behind them, but it is an appreciable risk that you need to be aware of. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:42:39
Nope. You're right, but there's some confusion between "account" and "address", as blockchain.info and other wallets use them fairly interchangeably. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:33:31
Basically a XOR of your wallet ID and password. More complicated than that, but that's the end result.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:55:41


You do. Time to clean it up. Probably a remote access trojan, like the rest of the people in this subreddit seem to have been affected by.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:37:15
Nothing is stopping you from doing that. 
Just bear in mind that the paper wallet has now been on an online computer, and it is remotely possible that it could have been stolen by malware (the point of a paper wallet is to stop this). 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:46:03
That's correct. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:09:43
Normally your client transparently handles the change addresses, you don't need to know about them unless you are using a paper wallet in this manner. 
The change address is generated and controlled by your client, be it Bitcoin-QT or Electrum or Multibit.

Electrum most certainly uses change addresses. It has a whole section for viewing them.

You've used the paper wallet on an internet connected device now though, which means that there's a potential for it to be compromised. That's the entire problem that a paper wallet is trying to avoid.

For all intents, they are.

A discussion about your post on  but yes, inspired by you!
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:06:33
That's correct, but I wouldn't suggest you use them anyway. Bear in mind that anybody in the world can attempt to guess your brain wallet, and can steal the coins with no problem. If you can think of a password, so can somebody else. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:17:48
Fixed. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:42:08
I am horribly uncomfortable with this. I hope like nothing else that nobody has used this to generate paper wallets.
