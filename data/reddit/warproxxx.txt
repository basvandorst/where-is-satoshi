Any idea which exchange is leading the buying (in times where bitcoin rise)? Which exchange are you noticing these sells on? Any particular one?


You believe most of the bigger action is happening outside the exchanges?
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:46:14
I haven't traded for a long time. Every cycle in crypto, different exchanges have been leading the action. Last time it was GDAX/Bitfinex for BTC/Fiat. But, it does not seem to be the case this time.
Which exchange is leading the price action this time? What exchange do you people use now?  It seems binance is the leader when it comes to BTC -&gt; Alts but what about fiat -&gt; BTC?

So, most of the buying is coming from US markets (and not the asian ones)?

In Soviet Russia, bitcoin buys the judge

The transaction id is 6cb1495614bab22f0ad093d13054ae340af70fdf97a71027096181e23a43c6c9
They seem to have sent the transaction because on blockr.io i can view the transaction but it has 0 confirmation.

Try opening the site with I2P

Make sure book sold aren't the one's whose softcopies are available torrent
@_date: 2015-01-31 07:42:00
Another possible way:
buying --&gt; Using a wallet on a VM routing all connections through I2P/TOR (or if you wont spend much btc, use a online wallet on blockchain via I2P + VPN (using vpn's with double tunneling like 'doublevpn')) --&gt; Using a trusted mixing service(ask uncle google for this) via which you send your purchased bitcoin and receive in your new anonymous wallet --&gt; spend anonymosly (unless you leak your ip to spending sites)

I remember few years ago how we bitcoiners used to dream of paypal integrating bitcoin.
But now it seems, the tide has turned
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:39:27
Apart from Kraken and Bitfinex which exchanges allow shorting cryptos in terms of USD (or coins like USDT, USDC, TUSD)?
@_date: 2017-04-05 05:23:05
If you are serious and have done your calculations you can do that in Poloniex &gt; Margin Trading.
Although i won't personally short an asset, which seems to be on a bullish trend - just make sure you have enough on your account to avoid the forced liquidations and know your risks.

From Nepal, thank you all.
Even the aftershocks coming one after another were extremly scary. There has been no elecyricty/internet for nearly 3 days. I lukily got access to electricity about an hour ago as i live near a important goverment office.
 Things are getting better now it seems.

Hey i am from neighbouring Nepal. can i also use your website to buy sell? What are the payment methods?
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:16:33
Thanks all!! 
I signed up and got a vcc from advcard. I will also get a plastic card from them.
Other providers also noted. I will use them too later.
Again thanks, this will solve a lot of my headaches

@_date: 2015-11-21 03:28:30
advcash has been providing this for years and it is not just for American Customers. And they dont require any identity verification. And they have options for virtual and real card. And it is cheaper too
Anyone can explain why this is bigger or better?

Actually a phising email cannot prove Coinbase was hacked because phising page can be created for any exchanges by just copying the login page 's source

Then looks like some shit secuirity. HF is skid forum, no underground type. Didnt took from there. I have no access to this forum, but if the 'hacker' posted this thread there too, then some suspesion

I am not very good in english. What i actually wanted to say is to expand in other developing countries as well, not just phillipins where fiat has restrictions to cross the boarder. I think Bitcoin can be very useful for that because we pay heafty fees to businessmen in order to send our money abroad and heavy fees to banks while receiving.
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:52:46
Yes. This one on the list was easiest to decrypt
This can be decoded easily. SQLi + Such shit encoding = maybe exchange deserves to be hacked
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:47:09
Devs should take note of SQL. Its a pretty common vulnerability. Even a 9 year can exploit it
