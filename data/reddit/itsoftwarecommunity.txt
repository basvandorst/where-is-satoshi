I myself have a trezor I got it a long time ago. buy 3 for $99 or some deal they had. I went in on a group buy so we could slip the cost :) , Over all the device is great. I myself use 2 diffrent wallets - 1.) multibit old edition i'm starting to move away from it right now. 2.) TREZOR , I use it with Electrum 2.6.4 and works great. If the start i was using the online wallet they offer but I like to keep control of my coins even if you are still in control i did not like the fact that it was online based.
When you 1st setup your trezor you will be given SEED KEYS to write down in your little book. This book should be kept in a box that can not be burned. This is in case you need to restore your device u can with the SEED KEY.
What i like to do is when firmware updates come out or what not is send my funds to a brand new ADDRESS back in say MULTIBIT before updating my firmware and then doing a full wipe of the device and restarting but thats just me. some times i just update the firmware with out doing all that but im lazy sometimes.
KeepKey - its just more or less a newer trezor device.
- on another note - its always a good idea to have a OFFLINE BASED WALLET on a pc somewhere. This can be used for COLD STORAGE. - Yes the trezor is the main idea for this but you do have a point what will happen in 10 years who knows. You device could be dead or something could happen you never know. SEED keys need to be the longest , I have a fear that one day some one will be able to crack the seed keys and walk away with all your funds. again keeping a WALLET.DAT on a offline pc is the best option. also you would need that PASSWORD. 
If you dont want to spend $$$ on a device then i would use Electrum or multibit with just your pc setup and password the files.
