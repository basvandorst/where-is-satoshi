Mmm they definitely don't have that little

I have an idea. Maybe it's supposed to mean that she saw some auction for a scam that is intended to retrieve bitcoins from dead wallets because someone had bumped it or "floated it" to the top of a bid list. The only thing that really doesn't make sense is a "floater bid" but it could definitely be a weird way to say a bid that bumps an auction into being seen.

I use Bter for trading because it has 0% fees in the BTC/CNY trading category. Are there any other exchanges or really is there anywhere else in life I can get 0% fees?

@_date: 2014-03-08 04:49:35
Yeah, I had about 70 bitcoins in it, so I might be interested in joining some sort of lawsuit.

...You really got 'em good.

As Mt. Gox users, what do we do to get back our money? I still don't really believe it has all just disappeared for everyone.

Wasn't theymos supposed to revamp the bitcoin forum with a shit-ton of donations he received? Still scamming?

Synonymizing Bitcoin with libertarianism is not what you want.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:44:29
Yeah, for sure. I mean even associating yourself with a scam sullies your name.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:07:22
I think Bitcoin is much less powerful than the concept of Bitcoin. While you can regulate one cryptocurrency, it's a different beast to regulate all. It's an amazing tool for dissent. Peer-to-peer systems are the ultimate civil disobedience
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:26:48
You can pump and dump a scam without believing in it, you know.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:05:07
I remember comments in a thread not long ago where there were claims that people would soon forget or pretend to forget that the Bitcoin community values low transaction fees and wants a currency, not a tax avoidance scheme... Or at least people used to.
What happened to the pro spending bitcoins directly view that practically made this subreddit?

Ehhh, it's not difficult to get a floppy reader now, I think it'll be fine

Highly related username
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:59:30
How does that relate to it? Other fairly large services have used Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:35:17
Concept itself is summa that good dystopian future shit
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:22:25
Yeah, I mean not bad at least

Always remember that the "divisible to 8 decimal places" is just the current limit. It's much more divisible than that if there are software changes.

You might directly pay for some services of a new web developer to clean up your site with Bitcoin. I think there are quite a few freelancers now who will accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-18 00:13:22
Imagine if Bitcoin became a well enough recognized currency to have businesses everywhere accept it. Maybe this is a step towards that.

If they could get a server farm running in a couple of locations we could practically eliminate downtime.

The same reason that you would upvote something relating to a recent disaster in the worldnews subreddit.

Pretty close to my situation. I bought $4 worth at ~$0.05/BTC and then forgot about it for quite a while.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:28:14
Why are you here if you don't want to use Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:41:56
Someone wrote something about this in another thread: when will be the first moment when there is a full cycle of being able to do all necessary things using only Bitcoin? Can anyone share a status report on this? The most major recent breakthrough I have seen was the ability to buy food more easily.

This is from The Big Lebowski, by the way.

If it was /b/, doubles are actually disabled, so it was a troll.

This was just fixed a moment ago.

I feel like the current issue with the price is that it is not rising rapidly enough. It looks ridiculous, but with the number of people that want to invest and the number of people who want to hold, the price needs to go up more rapidly so that fewer Bitcoins need to move.
