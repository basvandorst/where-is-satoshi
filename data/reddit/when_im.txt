Yeah duh, it’s a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:58
I don’t agree. I have a pretty decent idea. You are simply attacking conceptual ideas. I haven’t gone into how any of these things would be implemented. Registering identity and redistributing funds may be nothing to do with bitcoin but there is no reason why these things could not be implemented in a cryptocurrency. I have the feeling you know less than I do, but, whatever.
edit: if you feel I am being unfair and you do actually understand crypto fairly well, maybe you’d like to offer actual arguments related to the technical (im)plausibility of the things I talk about.
edit2: the response wasn’t mundane by the way. Your apparent assumption that a hard fork of bitcoin has to be like bitcoin is ludicrous.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:12:12
A company can go to complete shit and never recover. A scenario in which Bitcoin does that is.. unrealistic to say the least.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:51:08
Isn’t it just cos the first thing he/she did is traded it for BTC and that was the resulting BTC value?

showering is overrated ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:38:26
You're right, the difficulty (of the math problem) increases with more hashpower, but not immediately. The difficulty adjustment algorithm will look at averages (I guess) so if you throw in extra hashpower occasionally this will not immediatey push up difficulty (is my theory).
Usually (with BTC) miners would not have this luxury as there is too much competition from other miners. They can't just increase their hash power on a whim, they are genrally using everything they have all the time, just to keep their profit margins afloat.    
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:32:07
Two words isn't really thatmuch
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:41:29
I wonder how that smart Bitcoin mining service tasted?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:33:51
yeah, who the hell is pushing up BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:35:08
My explanation would be that miners who have a huge amount of hashpower to play with and only have a small amount currently mining BCH, sometimes do the following.
Immediately after mining a block containing user transactions increase the hashpower significantly and mine a couple of empty blocks. 
Because difficulty takes time to adjust, this sudden massive increase im hashpower will allow them to solve a block much quicker than usual. Users don't get mad because the transactions were confirmed in the previous block about a minute ago.
So the miner gets a couple of extra block rewards from the empty blocks, then reduce their hashpower again for a few cycles.
It's the only explanation I can see for this phenomena, becasue you're right, otherwise it really would be a major mathematical anomaly and that cannot occur over and over and over again(!) as it is now.

Listen, if you really are depressed and “still sitting on way more cash than most people in their mid 20s” then do what you know you must do: buy back in with your heart and soul. You will feel a lot less depressed.. even if it dips hard. Cos you’ll have that btc hardon back.

@_date: 2018-02-08 02:44:13
You don’t deserve the downvotes, because I reckon you honestly believe that. 
No, you don’t need to be a developer to understand Bitcoin. I am going to take a tiny chance here and say that most users on this sub would struggle to clearly explain all parts of Bitcoin. 
But it’s not hard to understand Bitcoin well enough, just with a bit of reading, to see its value.
When software is open source, not owned or controlled by anyone but run globally and voluntarily by thousands of people who don’t know one another and that software allows users to transfer value immutably to one another across the internet, secured using proven cryptography with no central server. Yeah it’s valuable.
edit: word
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:17:57
I’ve heard this idea thrown around before. I believe it requires controlling both 33% of hashpower and 33% of nodes. The idea being that the malicious party can block off a sufficient portion of the network behind the nodes they control that their 33% hashpower can be leveraged above 51%
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:40:36
Is that a technical thing? Does "convert" in a trading context mean something specific? (I've never heard that used). From a language point of view a conversion is taking place. If I convert km to miles, km aren't being destroyed either.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:28:11
I disagree. Anything that helps Bitcoin uptake is good for Bitcoin. Many many future Bitcoin users will never want to hold their keys or ever even understand what private keys are. Banks will be back and they will be Coinbase etc. The difference this time is that keeping your cash under the mattress (for those that do understand private keys) becomes a real option in the Bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:25:17
well, it was a lot less last time I looked, more like a $30 difference. But sure I can see that you'd need a lot of capital to leverage that difference.

Onboarding existing payment providers would obviously massively boost Bitcoin's uptake, acceptance, security, etc. It would be great.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:22:40
No Coinbase customers control their keys. You could systematically offload your crypto to a non-Coinbase wallet for which you did hold the keys though.

Why is this comment being upvoted, cos it sounds catchy? If it’s supposed to be an analogy, then what’s analogous to what? The boy is all the various warnings of Bitcoin being a bubble? And the wolf is the metaphorical pin that “truly” pops the bubble?

I would take this simple answer on the Coinbase forum as definitive. 
I.e. Get your coins out
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:53:22
A 51% attack is still only possible if there's an entity with 51% majority hashrate. So a drop is hashrate does not per definition mean a 51% attack. It just means that smaller miners are mining at a lower hashrate. 
There could be a risk if a big miner suddenly decides to re-enter the scene and suddenly they have &gt;51%, but the big miners are unlikely to suddenly turn malicious. They are generally there trying to make money like everybody else.

Shit this is the bit I don't really understand.
edit: when does this risk go away? Do I (and everybody else) have to basically wait until there is a clear winner?
Doesn't this risk mean anyone in their right mind should be cashing out before Aug 1? Why would anybody take the risk?
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:11:41
No, it's dependent on the total network hashing power. If a block is solved faster than expected it increases, but if a block is solved slower than expected it will decrease. The algorithm may be complex, but that's the general pattern.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:24:32
Ok, well then I would imagine any group that wants to make a safe split would change the transaction rules to secure the safety of their chain's transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:32:15
That's BIP-148 then, the thing that's being introduced Aug 1?

[Well it looks a bit like a dragon to be fair]( 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:10:14
That doesn't make any sense to me.
edit: ok, I kind of get what you're saying, but my comment was tongue in cheek. I wouldn't mine shit if there was no profit and these days there are no alts you can mine with a gpu that are worth trading for BTC.
But who knows, maybe the price will crash so bad on the BIP-148 chain that I can indeed make some profit off a gpu

New is relative. And I don't agree with your statement. While there are people hashing nobody is "ducked".. the fun continues
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:40:36
By die, I'm assuming you mean stagnate. It won't die in terms of uptake, as most nodes will be running BIP148
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:30:09
Sorry, what's that?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:30:27
Are you telling me this risk is present with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic?
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:15:02
Cos it'll be bad for Bitcoin? Sure I get that, but I would say eventually one will be stronger and the other will get marginalised or die completely. edit: my only concern is that my coins are safe and I can just go along with BOTH chains, so I'm never gonna lose out in terms of my coins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:49:49
Use a local Electrum wallet on your PC or Android phone. It's one of the wallets recommended by the main Bitcoin site. edit: here's the link: 
Getting funds on it is another story. A quick Google took me here. Seems like a good option:  
You can even use the bitcoin.com.au wallet app TEMPORARILY to make it easy to send your bitcoin from bitcoin.com.au to your Electrum wallet. But don't keep your bitcoin on bitcoin.com.au, because you will not control your private keys there (you will with Electrum)
Once you've bought some bitcoin on bitcoin.com.au, send it from the bitcoin.com.au app to your Electrum wallet. If you run Electrum on your PC, you can scan the QR code in the "Receive" tab of the Electrum wallet using the bitcoin.com.au app to easily send our coins over to your Electrum wallet.

Ah come on, I can dream can't I? XD
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:51:40
I can see that.. just checked and it's 2016 blocks per difficulty adjustment. That's 2 weeks at normal speed, but with a big hashrate drop we could be in for trouble ��
edit: any idea who's expected to leave and what percentage of the current hash rate that is?
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:21:17
But are you speculating and getting lucky or mining coins that already have an established exchange rate? I've got 290X cards. Edit: could you give an example of a coin worth mining?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:25:03


Is this really possible? I don't get it. Surely bitcoin security is not reliant on the goodwill of miners not to do this ^^ 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:38:27
But I thought a hard fork means a separate coin, like with Ethereum. Once a hard fork has taken place there are 2 coins?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:26:38
Do any core devs have an opinion about Drivechain?
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:39:29
Are you telling me you are profiting off gpu mining? Don't you pay for electricity?
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:56:18
So in theory if we end with 2 coins and they both do quite well, early on at least, people will have basically doubled their coins. Nice.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:01:38
So TIL some stuff:
A soft fork is actually worse than a hard fork it seems..
Cos if you spend coins when there are still 2 active soft forks you can lose the whole darn lot.
So whatever happens you don't spend any coins on either of the soft fork chains until there's a clear soft fork winner.
If one of the soft forks gets hard forked, that's kind of a good thing, cos you can get that new fork's software and use your coins safely in that new fork.
Hope I'm understanding all this correctly.
