I think you are confusing adding a decimal place with inflation. 21.00000000 million bitcoins is identical to 21.000000000 million bitcoins. If you own one bitcoin it still represents 1/21million of the whole pie regardless of eight or nine decimal places. However , if they decide to shift the decimal place over to the right and increase the btc supply to, say, 210 million, then you have inflation of the bitcoin supply so your original 1 btc would only represent 1/210million of the whole pie, a much smaller amount.

Honest question. How would one go about buying several bitcoins every few weeks, consistently, and without large markup? For my situation, Coinbase is the easiest solution. I travel internationally full time, so whenever I am near a BTM I will try to buy with the local currency I have on hand, but it is just too difficult to make large buys. LocalBitcoins or Mycelium local is not consistent in the cities I travel, not to mention I would be hit double on the markup by withdrawing cash from and ATM (~2%) plus the markup on the local buy.

If you switch to a more private email address you just tie that new address to a new HD wallet? Maybe there is a way to make the process more decentralized so there would not need to be a centralized database for anything.

I'm not sure it matters in relation to this point. If this ever came about, you wouldn't be tied to one email address in order to accept btc. A cool implementation would be to make an email address act as an HD wallet tied to an xpub key. You would only ever have to give out your email address but btc would be stored in different address all wrapped up and working in the background invisible to the user.

Didn't they say that once you connect the 21 chip to the mining pool you will automatically start generating satoshis, even before a block is found. They are basically advancing you btc which is along the same lines as just pre-purchasing the btc with the device. The added benefit of the mining chip is to compete with large scale mining operations possibly reversing the current trend.

I've wanted to tip the YouTube electronics reviewer Marques Brownlee, MKBHD. I absolutely love watching his videos and he has a large following of almost 2 million subscribers. Unfortunately his videos get thousands of comments very quickly after upload so I haven't tipped him yet for fear of it getting buried. I think he would be an excellent "public figure" to get as a Bitcoin proponent. Perhaps we could make an effort to Changetip bomb one of his future uploads and convince him to look into BTC and do a video on it? IMO that would get a lot of bang for our buck as his following is interested in new tech trends and might be interested by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-30 04:55:14
+1 . I have many friends interested in bitcoin however creating a paper wallet is too complicated for them. I'm not comfortable doing it for them because then I would feel responsible if they messed up or if my computer had some malware or something. Trezor was the perfect answer for them. I now have a few clients strictly paying me in btc and one of them is putting significant amounts of savings into btc.  None if this would have happened without Trezor.

Ah this same type of ATM is near my house. It actually has a software bug where if you clear out all the btc from the account the last bill you put into the machine will be counted but the bill will be returned to you.

I actually experienced something similar with Circle during the Bearwhale event. I was waiting for my bank account to be verified on Circle when the wall went up, but since I already had one of my credit cards verified I decided to use that. Coincidentally, Coinbase was out of bitcoins at the time as well, so credit card on Circle was really my only option.
Everything seemed to go okay, and they said my transaction was processing. When I logged back in a week later to check on my purchase I found that the transaction was canceled. I was furious, not only because the price was up much higher at that point, but also because there was no effort from Circle to reach out to me. I contacted support and they were quick to get back to me and very nice. Unlike you, I understand why my purchase was considered high risk since it was my first purchase on Circle and with credit card. I'm angry though, that nothing was done to prevent the issue in the first place, no email, nothing. In the back of my head I wonder if the transaction would have been canceled had the price continued to drop after Bearwhale? 
At the time, like you, I was so angry I vowed never to use Circle again. I've had good luck with Coinbase so far and all of my transactions have been at random times for random amounts, some for quite a lot. I guess like others have mentioned we are really just at the mercy of both of these companies trying to stay "legit" in the eyes of Fincen. After reading your post I won't be surprised now to have a similar event with Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:27:38
I actually wrote in to Changetip the other day suggesting that they show a "Top 10" list of most tipped YouTube videos over the past 24hrs/1week/1month etc. (could also be expanded to twitter and Reddit). This would not only give a good real-time metric of what other people are interested in, but also provide a compelling monetary figure to demonstrate the power of Changetip and encourage new charities/artists/content creators etc to entertain looking into BTC.

Lol! Nice market reaction to Q3 report today huh?
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:19:07
I believe Circle said my funds would be available in 5 days or something after I initiated the purchase. I logged in several times the same day as my purchase and the transaction was always listed as processing. I'm not certain how long I went after that day before logging back in. Regardless, if the transaction was flagged as potentially fraudulent, I should have been notified right away. If an algorithm flagged my purchase I should have had instant feedback; if a human is processing the flags then I should have had the chance to verify my purchase at the designated price. There should never be a long wait between the purchase and cancellation and there should always be communication if something happens.

Thanks for the more in depth view... At some point all that money created from QE will go somewhere, right? And if it doesn't and interest rates stay near zero there is still a case where Bitcoin would out perform near zero interest rates in which case we would eventually see larger investments and then a positive feedback loop would result from Bitcoin fixed supply. What other factors are worth considering to get a better picture? Thx
@_date: 2012-09-13 07:23:35
Many people make bitcoins in nefarious ways. Either by using bots to mine on other peoples computers or stealing etc. Does anyone know how many bitcoins are accumulated in this fashion? And then, in turn, how much of the bitcoin selling volume is from these shady btc's?
I imagine most of the people making bitcoins in a shady way are turning around and converting them into USD or the like to realize a profit. So potentially a lot of people buying into bitcoins are just paying off people trying to offload their stolen goods. 
How much does this affect price long term? When mining difficulty increases and security increases could the market stagnate and just become a bunch of hoarders?
It seems like if ingenuity of BTC ideas and adoption rate continue to increase then the currency will see a good future. But I could also see a future where the excitement wears off and the crooks cant make any more money so the price fizzles.

Are you looking for a method for churning with btc? I think the fees to buy btc with a credit card would make it difficult. you would also open yourself up to a lot of risk if the market moves the wrong way while waiting to convert back to fiat

Of course I understand the reasons behind a suspicious looking transaction being flagged. But how many times do you need to speak to customer service to resolve an issue? If you are the true account holder, no more than once. If you have to call back two additional times, they aren't doing their job and the legacy system is hindering you. Just another example of how bitcoin would have been a super easy solution to that particular case.

Furthermore, as we all assume the price of BTC will rise over the long term, using the example of the equities might not actually be that bad of a model for bitcoin despite its young age.
