28 U.S. Code § 3002 - Definitions
(15)"United States" means-
(A) a Federal corporation;
(B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or
(C) an instrumentality of the United States.
So curmodgeon how is it exactly that you live in a federal corporation? Please realize that I did not get that from wiki. It's from a code you live by.
By all means, renounce your citizenship to the "United States",  the federal corporation. You will always be American, they don't own that!

cognitive dissonance. The fact of 28 USC conflicts with your opinion based belief system. In order for you to maintain inner harmony requires you to excuse away the fact, title 28, so you can continue living in your fantasy/opinion. Your belief in the "United States" is based in the gutter vernacular.

I used to think we (U.S. citizens) were protected from direct taxes and at one time up until 1913 we were. But they couldn't survive (Steal) under the constitutional restraints the people had on them. I always wondered how the constitution became irrelevant on some of the critical protections it gave us like payments to government in gold or silver coinage (Lawful money) no capitation etc. Then I found Title 28 U.S. Code.

Parallel Universe, we live in a corporation void of those rights. We fall under private agreement and use private bank notes that have different rules that put us in some type of taxation with a couple of private companies to pay for the loans given to the United States federal corporation. The United States of America is the free country we were taught about and gave allegiance to but the "United States" is in reality where we live, in a corporation by private agreement with a whole set of other laws and rules where the constitution is irrelevant. Private contract supercedes the constitution.
