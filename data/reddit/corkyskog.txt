Once the black market moves over to monero or some other coin, bitcoin will drop to a fraction of its value eventually stabilize. We will find out soon enough what its real value is.

If everyone's bottom is 5k, why would it go below 5k? If everyone buys in at 5k then that becomes the bottom.

There is a huge amount of systemic risk and I wouldn't downplay that. But to say that ALTS are all BTC derivatives is disingenuous. Most alts are, but there are others that are ETH derivatives, and some that aren't derivatives of anything.

What is the concept of seasonality then?
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:11:54
I might be hung up on the definition of derivative. Can you explain exactly what makes ETH a derivative of BTC? That might help clear things up for me.

I don't have a crystal ball but the late adopters first started hearing about it when it was at around 4k, that was the first hype train, then another at 5k, then another round at around 9-10k. I will be surprised if it really breaks too far down from 10k, I will really be surprised if it goes below 5k. 
A lot of these late adopters view BTC like stocks. Whatever they first heard the value as, will be what is pegged in their mind. So to the last wave 9k is the bottom and the top is 18-19k, when it starts going below 10k there will be mental pressure to buy back in at what they perceive as the floor, because that's what individual investors have been (incorrectly) trained to do with stocks for decades. Which I never really got because you never know what the floor is, even in the stock market. At least in the stock market you can take all the assets and capital and liabilities and figure out what would be left if they went bankrupt. So there is that, many stocks truly have a floor above 0, crypto does not (with the exception of a few novel coins).

So it's not a derivative of BTC, it's just that BTC is the reserve currency in crypto. Meaning just like in the real world, a lot of currency values are correlated to USD, but the currencies aren't derivatives of the dollar (with exceptions, I  believe some south American currencies are USD derivative currencies). For ETH, to be a derivative of BTC, it would mean you would need to exchange your ETH contact for a BTC contract in order to convert to the reserve fiat (USD). This is not the case with ETH, so it's not a derivative of BTC, it is its own currency. If BTC goes down ETH doesn't have to, it just so happens that because BTC has become an indicator of crypto currencies by becoming the reserve that it's highly correlated. Is that a fair statement?

Just realize that if you hodl long enough you should be fine. I feel bad for people actually trying to use bit coins for transactions. Imagine trying to buy something when the transfer times are like hours and the volatility is super high by the minute... you could send coins, pay a ridiculous fee and them still have only made half the payment once the coins reach the recipient and the value plummeted.

Always primary level deflation and second/tertiary level inflation. It just is, I am not smart enough to know if that's bad or good. I imagine it depends which economist you ask.

They already exist there is one a litte less than hour from me. You can buy or sell $500 US worth of BTC or ETH A DAY, with just a cell phone number to get the verification text. Over 500 you need to scan ID and get a picture of your face taken.
I would have to be pretty desperate to use it though, the fees are ridiculous. They charge 10% over spot at real time rates, PLUS a flat transaction fee of $5. Same goes with selling 10% under spot, I don't think that there is a transaction fee for selling tho.

The crimes are against the money in the US. Money has no legal protections, so they charge the money instead of the person.

It's reddit, assume your audience is 5.

Yes, but it is appropriate to mention that it doesn't pertain to the previous conversation. Otherwise you end up with people believing they are one in the same and they both have managers and large fees.
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:59:51
So what was the point of your comment then? One is risk free for the institution and typically doesn't/shouldn't have a fee, the other is extremely expensive and risky to operate and does/should have a fee to compensate for that.
Seems misleading to bring up considering that's not what the conversation was about.

There is a huge difference between actively managed hedge funds and passive index funds. Index funds are close to free to operate, management could be achieved by a computer algorithm, but you will never beat the market's returns. 
Hedge funds on the other hand need strong leaders with thick skin, Quants, etc. Hedge funds promise big returns and sometimes they deliver, sometimes they don't, so unlike an index find you can outperform the market (but the market can outperform you). There is no proof a managed fund will perform significantly better than the average, although hedge funds tend to perform way better than mutual funds. But hedge funds usually require a half a million starting investment or higher to get into. 
Mutual funds are considered a waste of money nowadays, because of the large fee and gains that on average tend to be on par with the market. Index funds are now considered the smart bet for the average investor. Hedge funds are lucrative but participation usually requires an initial investment that is out of range for most investors.

Don't report them? Just report crypto to tangible currency or other stores of wealth.

From what I understand, it's kind of debated with the whole coin base ruling. Basically they said they don't need to provide customers with coin to coin records. There is also the stance that since it's not specifically mentioned in any of the guidance that you would be paying a tax that doesn't exist and setting precedent that at least you believed that tax was owed for some reason.

Just call the number on the box, if you complain the fee is two high they will offer to drop the percentage between 2-5%

Why would the 10k apply? I thought crypto is now an asset and no longer a currency...

Except it's a $1 or $2 insurance contract for a couple days. If powerball runs 3 times a week, your cost is $312 a year and excluding the big prize, with the odds of around 90 something of those dollars returning to you (can't remember the exact distribution, but isn't as skewed to the top as people think). 
So if paying 225 dollars a year buys you this insurance AND you get a real sense of enjoyment out of it, I say go for it. There is tons of entertainment that costs more than that, and doesn't come with a chance to win a large sum of money. Just because it might not be particularly entertaining to you or I, doesn't mean you should look down on that value. People pay hundreds of dollars a year just to upgrade to premium Telle, and watch garbage all night and weekend, how is the lottery any worse? It gives someone, something to talk or day dream about without rotting your mind.
