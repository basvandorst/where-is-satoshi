Just look at Venezuela and you can see what happens. The price of bread "skyrockets" and your hard earned money is wiped out.
So people switch to a more stable currency. Bitcoin is more stable.
But how do you know how many BTC is equal to a loaf of bread? If it used to be $5 for a loaf of bread, but due to currency destruction it's now $INFINITY for a loaf of bread, then you can't just say some tiny amount of BTC is equal to $INFINITY. It becomes more useful to treat BTC as value in itself, rather than priced in terms of dollars.
Just like today $5 is a reasonable value for a load of bread because people buying it and selling it know what other things they can buy for about $5 and how much labor you'd pay for $5 etc. So it's a "known" amount, because everyone is consistent. But, it doesn't have to be dollars.
You can also be consistent saying "100 satoshi is about a loaf of bread in year 2021" and you'd get 95% of people agreeing because it's appropriate based on known prices of everything else: labor, gold, butter, milk, computers, diamonds, fish, etc.
So people just stop talking about dollars, and it's satoshi-this and satoshi-that, and everyone just "knows" or has a "feeling" about how much stuff is worth in terms of BTC without converting to USD or any other now worthless currency anymore.
It's a great situation for people with the foresight to realize fiat will inevitably crash and there is no such thing as "sustainable devaluation" of currency. HODL!

I don't want fiat to crash, but I also don't want the government to keep printing money but that's not going to happen. Ever.
So, I'll take my chances on Bitcoin and hope that the government won't be able to even fund WWIII. Imagine Venezuela trying to "go to war". It's barely able to stay afloat as it is. I'm not sure war would make any sense in that situation.

You'll get a lot of different opinions on that. Is it safe from getting hacked? No. Even though they claim to have really good security, cold storage, etc. there are still many vectors of attacks, internal and external. If they get hacked, will you lose all your money? Probably not, as they have insurance and FDIC. And that won't protect you if there are weird legal loopholes or they simply can't recover your funds due to "extenuating circumstances".
In my opinion, you don't have Bitcoin on Coinbase. Coinbase has GRANTED you TEMPORARY access to some coins they own, represented by being a "Coinbase account holder" with some "Balance" which is just a set of numbers in their private database. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS. 
If they, at a whim, decide to convert all your Bitcoin to Bcash, unilaterally claiming that "Bcash is the real Bitcoin" then you have NO RECOURSE. If they decide you don't have rights to the Bcash created by the fork, then you have NO RECOURSE. In fact, almost everything they do you have NO RECOURSE because they have an army of lawyers and thousands of other users to worry about and you're really not that important to them.
That being said, if you're still LEARNING, it's a "safe enough" place to keep a small amount of coins that you're willing to lose, while you begin to learn how to securely keep your coins. A lot of people will lose their coins kept on their hard drive because they FORGOT their password or their hard drive CRASHED and didn't back up anything. So, until you get reasonably competent at managing your wallet securely, Coinbase is a good TEMPORARY location.

Browsers made it an order of magnitude easier to get information that they used to need to go to newspapers, yellow pages, and libraries to get. Not only that, but it opened up real-time mail order catalogs. From business to communications. All of that was a game changer.
I think the game changer for Bitcoin is that, by reducing payment friction to nearly zero, the way humans interact and think about money will completely change. 
Right now, we still think about buying or selling stuff one at a time. So what people build is still related a lot to that - that's like newspapers publishing on the web, and sears catalog going digital. A little better, but not a game changer.
Instead, I think the concept of spending and earning money will begin to flow in a much more liquid fashion. As you interact with the web and the world, you'll think about money as like "fuel" or "energy" constantly being drained or topped up based on various activity.
For example, as you spend time contributing your energy to things, you seamlessly get paid as you watch your balance increase. And you'll navigate from place to play with your balance decreasing, and as long as you were happy with the result, the payments settle.
It's not that this system is wildly different than the old system, it's just that it happens so much faster and smoothly and real-time that there's no way to go back to the old one. The old one feels archaic. You don't want to take out your credit card, when your browser is handling all your earnings and payments automatically within milliseconds and micropayments are happening at extremely high speed. Not to mention, there is no trustless micropayment system better than LN right now.
On top of that, with all the smart contracts, people will start to think about payments a lot differently. But that's after the first phase, where people are already comfortable with native digital currency integration.
So overall, what happens is that like how Google allows you to just simply "search" and get all the information you need within seconds, the future is one in which real-time you simply ask for something and it gets fulfilled instantly with almost no friction. Whatever you need, whether it's a chef for a party, a lawyer for your traffic ticket, accurate news about Trump, a wedding dress that matches some criteria, help from a therapist -- it all comes real-time and settles instantly.
If you think about it today, when you need something, there's still a lot of digging around and searching and coordinating that needs to happen. The future frictionless digital economy eliminates all of that nonsense, and just goes to rapid, direct peer-to-peer payments for any and all problems you might have.
Of course, I'm a bit biased about this future, because I am working on apps that make it happen. I could be wrong, but at least that's the vision I hold in my mind when I'm building stuff.

Sure, but you'll have to trust that Coinbase and their lawyers working with the insurance agent and their lawyers all come to an agreement that somehow protects you in case something bad happens. And during that time, you're basically screwed without access to funds and time spent worrying about whether the insurance will kick in properly or not. Do you know the exact details of the terms of the insurance? I doubt anyone does, and in the end, it could just be a long court battle. I mean, sure, it's better than no insurance, but why bother with it if you could just learn how to keep your own wallet securely?

I am thinking of creating a new coin that is exactly the same as Bitcoin but has LN from the start. Only transactions greater than 1 mbtc would be permitted on chain. Also, the block size would be 32kb and found every 6 hours instead of 10 minutes.
This would keep the storage requirements much lighter and rely on LN but I don't see anything wrong with that. Most transactions would happen through it, with channel creation being the defacto wallet initialization.
I haven't solved a way to keep everyone's coins, but I think some built-in connectivity to Bitcoin where is recognizes any transaction greater than 1 mbtc on the Bitcoin chain as also called on this altcoin is what I'm imagining. So anyone with coins can be recognized once they have at least 1 mbtc.
Just an idea. I'm also challenged by the big storage requirements and since LN is coming, I'd like to take advantage of that to shrink the chain.

I agree, would love to shift focus on purpose. Unfortunately, most people are poor or greedy, and prefer to think of Bitcoin as some kind of investment vehicle. That being said, I think for those of us who prefer to avoid price talk, it will be a huge struggle against the stream, trying to change all of those people.
As someone once said, Bitcoin is a ground-breaking technical innovation disguised as a get-rich-quick scheme. It's extremely attractive to pumps &amp; dumps, and extremely attractive to people who like to gamble by trying to guess the highs and the lows.
It's going to be tough to wane people off their gambling addictions, not that we shouldn't try. But we should be realistic. And maybe also, not worry about it too much. Because in the end, every time it attracts such people, it gains greater overall notoriety. And even if large price dumps deter people, and make people rage quit, they've at least been introduced to the concept. Maybe they will learn their lesson, maybe they won't. But the ecosystem will have grown.
I'm tired of the price talk too, but I've learned it's better to be Zen about it, accept it, and continue our own ways of choosing to talk about adoption and technology and all the other great parts of Bitcoin, even if it's in isolated pockets between the price noise. I don't think we need to attack price talk, we just need to allow price talk to lure people in, and then use that opportunity when they have their attention, to talk to them about the actual properties of Bitcoin that make it a technological revolution more important than the price.

On top of that, a lot of people live in fear of their government. I don't blame them, the kind of stuff government agencies do these days.
So, even if they KNOW they are being ripped off by the government, as many are, they may be hesitant to "take control" by using Bitcoin or really anything, without government approval. Because as soon as the government decides something is illegal and starts punishing people, the average person will stay the hell away.
Bitcoin does have a chance to deteriorate the government's power just by existing, but it does mean the early adopters are on the front lines of the battle and could get wiped out easily. By wiped out, I mean, feds knocking down your door for "computer hacking" which is nonsense. But, you know, they need to make an example out of these people.
And while the government still abuses it's power on a day-to-day basis, the war has really just begun. The cats out of the bag though.
My point is that it's going to be way too early for mainstream for a long time -- it will be mainstream once people are no longer afraid of the government because the government is too crippled and can't afford to do what it needs to do. Which could come in the form of hyperinflation. A seriously needed hyperinflation, given the amount of overspending we see in government. A massive currency correction.
So, I kinda feel like we should tone down the whole mass adoption target, and focus on protecting ourselves, securing the front, and gathering support by enlightening people about why Bitcoin matters.
I'd rather have 1 more person who understands the fraud that is the government as it stands today, than 100,000 more people who just want to buy starbucks with Bitcoin.

In all fairness, that zero risk doesn't come free.
And people say, "the retailers pay for fees". In practice, retailers are not a charity. They make up for the fees by raising prices. It might be hardly visible with enough margins, but clearly, something/somebody is absorbing the cost, and in the end, it's likely the customer (spread out between the credit card purchasers and cash purchasers).
Credit card companies are sharks, and they are playing the average consumer making money hand over fist, for sitting around and delivering a piece of plastic in the mail. 19% interest. transaction fees from merchants. It's an inefficient system. We can do better than that with crypto, we really don't need the middleman in transactions. If we need multisig escrow, we should use it. There's no reason to let these financial companies destroy us with the facade of providing "zero risk shopping".

There is too much emphasis on this so-called "split community". I don't think the community was split at all, any more than people who love Venmo are split from people who prefer PayPal who are split from people who prefer Bitcoin. People have always had a choice to run whatever software they want to run, and thus, use whatever coin or version of coin they want. People will believe and prefer choices that they want, every day, in various facets of their lives. 
Bitcoin has always represented the highest level of technical soundness, supported by convincing technical arguments. It has never been a democracy where the loudest person whining has more say in how it will work. For power-hungry megalomaniacs, Bitcoin is an exercise in frustration. It is inevitable that a meritocracy would give rise to nonsense like bcash (or bsv, babc, whatever it is called these days). Bitcoin prefers to represent technical soundness, rather than fairness, because I think the hundreds+ of brilliant developers behind it won't let nonsense into the code base. And from that, stems the thousands+ of people who run Bitcoin nodes because of that.

There are no separate tokens, it uses bitcoin in a smart-contract way.
So when you set up a lightning node/wallet you will be creating a "channel" which is a term for a bitcoin smart contract that will let you transfer funds back and forth with almost no fee, and instantly, and securely (still requires no trust, as normal bitcoin).

I think it's pretty clear to me when greedy people jump on board. The community is filled with FOMO memes and more talk about prices than about real technology and use-cases. Complete beginners are happily jumping in using Coinbase, happily giving away their PRIVATE information to a 3RD PARTY CUSTODIAN the exact opposite of what Bitcoin is meant to be. They only want ROI. This is the speculative crowd. There is also a non-speculative crowd, slowly accumulating over time, understanding that Bitcoin is the only safe place against interventionist monetary policy. But, in the wild swings of speculation, Bitcoin isn't safe against speculative crashes. The non-speculative crowd sits out, waiting for the speculators to get burned to the ground by each other. The chart begins to die. Even the most patient speculators start to abandon ship. And, eventually, the price bottoms back out to the pre-FOMO pre-speculation level. And that's when you can see the non-speculative crowd sowing their seeds for a 4-year harvest time again. Little daily or weekly gains. Seemingly meaningless tiny gains.
Of course, those tiny gains get speculators excited AGAIN, and the cycle repeats. But as someone who actually believes in the fundamental promise of Bitcoin AND doesn't want to get burned by speculators, waiting for seeding time is critical. When is it seeding time? When the downswings disappear, and the level matches the historical average rate of how often non-speculators are entering Bitcoin. The real holders, not "HODLers" trying to lift up the price and prevent losses, but people who don't need to tell others to hold and don't need to tell themselves to hold. They understand how bad the existing system is, and can't imagine going back anymore.
What price is this mystical line? It's anyone's guess, but if you generally take the pre-spike slow accumulation line, and extrapolate, you can get a sense of where it should be. But anyone can be wrong about how many long-term holders are actually slowly accumulating. It's the only price that really matters, everything else is the storm above the ground.
The beauty is that the system tests the resolve of speculators again, and again, and again. When it crashed from $1,163 to $163, we found the floor. We'll find the floor again, but nobody can truly predict it. Other than the floor tends to be higher than the last floor.
This last speculative crash floors were around $3000 and before that about $1000 and before that about $700 and then before that $300. So, all of these are possibilities. My guess would be that around $2000-$3000, most of the speculators will be flushed out. If not, great! Every crash gets us closer to the true price. That is the price at which nobody cares about the price anymore.

It would be free, no Bitcoin needed to search!
*How is search result quality maintained?*
The idea is that you search on some keywords, but you can actually upvote or downvote the result like on reddit. The vote tally would define how much the site owner would need to pay per page view to keep their position. If something is voted very high and is very popular already, it would be super cheap (or sometimes just free) to keep that position because of how useful it is to people.
On the other hand, if something is voted low, the site owner would have to pay out more Bitcoin to keep their position. This pushes bad sites lower down the search results.
*What about bots and fake votes?*
Along with fraud detection based on suspicious activity (same IP, same time period, unnatural clicks) the system can also have proof-of-stake weighting on votes. As a logged-in user (which isn't required either), you can prove that you own some large number of Bitcoin, and as long as the coins don't move, your votes can count a "little" bit more in terms of being less suspicious. It's not perfect, but it's basically harder/expensive for a fraudster to buy up a lot of Bitcoin just to fake a lot of votes. And it doesn't cost the user anything, since they are just signing the fact that they own coins. They don't pay a thing.
*How will this site go from empty to full of good search results?*
People who submit links will earn Bitcoin on valid upvotes! The rate at which you can submit more links is based on how many upvotes your past submissions received. So, you can't just spam crap into the system. You will earn a higher rate overall per upvote if you have a strong past history of high upvote content, and a lower rate for a low past history. And your posting account is terminated if you have a lot of negative marks/reports (illegal links, duplicate links, affiliate tagged links, etc).
There is also a caveat that if a site owner _claims_ a domain, the submitter can no longer earn money on votes to any links under that domain.
*How much will I get paid for submitting links?*
Lots of Bitcoin. Just kidding! It all depends on how much growth the site gets. In the beginning, expect to get paid a really sweet amount. Once the site is heavily bootstrapped, though, expect to be paid less over time. And don't try to defraud the system by asking your friends to upvote your links. Fake clicks will be detected and you'll lose what you earned.

If you combine all of the above subsets of people, the actual UTILITY MARKET of bitcoin is very small. Bitcoin does have a bright future, but that's true whether or not bitcoin is worth $1.00 or $1 million. 
So, going back to your question, why isn't it popular yet even though everyone has heard of it? Because nobody in mainstream needs it, yet.
But that will change. More people will be squeezed out by banks, more people will get frustrated and sick of all the privacy and security leaks by corporate institutions and even the government. More people will get sick of the value of their money disappearing every day because Trump or the Federal Reserve or our "elected officials" whom really, are like puppets hired by your neighbors trying to steal from you. And it will change in a hurry, if (or should I say when) hyperinflation hits their own national currency. If it hits any of the major ones, dollar, euro, yen, yuan, pound -- you're going to see a price jump that makes $20k seem like peanuts. Keyword "if".
But the average person is incredibly impatient. They demand ROI. They demand easy, cheap, simple. They don't want to learn. They wan't things handed to them, delivered to them, with a ribbon and bow. And that's just not happening with a technology that requires a base level of understanding people are not accustomed to. And that is, the ability to do their own research, make their own decisions, to distrust by default, and to verify on their own. 
It's easier to sign up for Coinbase, and cry when the price drops.
So yeah, it's going to be a while before it's mainstream. But when it hits, it's going to hit like a damn truck because they'll not be using bitcoin by choice, really, it will be by necessity to survive.

Lightning uses smart contracts with regular bitcoin. A channel is just a bitcoin transaction with special rules supported by the bitcoin protocol. So, you don't need to trust a 3rd party at all (key feature of lightning). So you get instant payments, no 3rd party trust, and almost zero fees. I think a lot of people will get behind the system, because of all of the advantages plus it's just another way of using the same bitcoin we love, at the end of the day.

And who decided any of those things would be necessary in the first place? Hint: it wasn't consumers. Who sponsored more regulation? Who wants an economy based on more lending, more borrowing, and more consumption? Who wants a system that requires authentication, and complete loss of privacy? Who wants a system that includes some people, but not others? Who wants a system where fraud happens easily, so that a service to prevent fraud becomes conveniently profitable? Who wants a system that requires international agents?
I think there is a slowly growing distrust in the way the government, federal "economists", and banking/credit institutions are manipulating people. You say it won't dominate the mainstream, but there are advantages and benefits to Bitcoin that go beyond just making payments. The value of freedom to make transactions without permission is perhaps only easily seen by those who don't have it. I believe it will dominate the mainstream, either by necessity when the existing system collapses under the weight of it's own lending, or that people just realize that the ridiculous architecture under which the existing regulations live is completely unnecessary and even abusive. For me, it's only a matter of time before a significant enough group decides to take back their autonomy, and the mainstream will follow as they always do.

Lightning solves a different problem, so I don't think that's really a goal for anyone. Instead, Liquid might be what you're looking for.
@_date: 2018-11-17 12:14:36
Not quite. 
Whereas bitcoin keys are static, lightning depends on dynamic activity. It's like trying to take a photo of a video. It keeps changing, so your photo never really captures everything. And the risk with lightning is, if you happen to take a photo that wasn't the latest, and try to restore the video, you can end up scrambling everything rather than recovering - which is interpreted by the network as a potential attempt to defraud. And thus, you can get penalized by others and losing your funds.
It's tricky, but I am hopeful this will be solved. Lightning backups are important, and I think we need it before we really go mainstream with lightning. People have enough of a hard time from losing their Bitcoin keys. Lightning is even trickier.

No, it's because nobody said LNBIG was the sole reason Lightning could be considered "exploding". It's been growing over time. Yet, your argument is that since this one influx of liquidity from LNBIG is centralized and somehow associated to CP, Lightning is NOT "exploding" - ignoring all of the progress and growth that has been made up until now.
So, your title is misleading and full of negativity and ripe with agenda. Every piece of technology, software, and idea will have bumps on the road to success, and making sky-is-falling claims that because of a problem here or there without a look at the bigger picture is ridiculous. Lightning is new, it's growing, and it's getting bugs worked out every single day. It's looking more and more solid every day.

Because of different volumes and different traders with different needs. There's always people trying to do arbitrage, and generally that helps equalize prices if anything. But yes, there are fees and risk that can undermine profitable arbitrage. On top that delays and publishing fraudulent prices/trades can happen.

@_date: 2018-11-22 18:50:04
Bitcoin keeps everyone honest, including speculators. There is nothing built-in to Bitcoin that guarantees an investor will make big returns. The only guarantee is that the inflation rate of Bitcoin cannot be manipulated - which means, a 3rd party cannot coerce the system into stealing your money. But that doesn't mean speculation is good.
When you speculate, without contributing anything at all, expecting something from nothing, the laws of economics punishes you for such a terrible decision. When you take the gamble that Bitcoin adoption will be at some point at some time in the future, again, a terrible decision that will be punished.
The beauty is, people will learn. They might leave Bitcoin forever, deciding it was a scam. But good riddance, their only "contribution" was hoping to "cash out" later - taking their money back, with some fantasy gains they had in mind.  Or, they might learn from the experience, start to question their own crazy thoughts of speculation, and start grounding their decisions in reality rather than price movements. A huge win for both them, and for Bitcoin.
Price talk is noise and nonsense. If the price drops, it means a lot of people who didn't need to be holding Bitcoin in the first place, stopped holding Bitcoin. Because if they truly needed it, they wouldn't have sold it. So it's actually giving a much more accurate painting of Bitcoin. Furthermore, it pushes greedy miners to slow down. Yes, mining is good, but excessive mining is also meaningless. The only price that matters are the lows, and the more lows we have, the better. And if the newer lows are higher than the previous lows, it's a sign of good growth. And if the newer lows are lower than the previous lows, then we're getting healthier but possibly not healthy yet.
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:26:24
The reason why there's no good "bitcoin-node-as-a-service" is because it undermines the whole point of not needing to trust anyone. Do you trust the full node? Or would anyone else? The full node is the one verifying that any transaction is valid or not. If it lies to you, it can steal your money.
SPV is a good approach for lightweight clients, as it doesn't rely on one node for verification. You can certainly look into that.
Also keep in mind, the browser might avoid sending private keys or passwords, but it can still leak information to the node. Privacy is important, and broadcasting to any full node you don't own (or that the wallet owner doesn't own) means leaking what kind of transactions they are making, to which addresses, etc. and possibly combining addresses to figure out which ones belong to someone.
That's what makes full nodes nice.

It makes bitcoin for me because a website owner can pay for higher rankings. But, if it gets down voted, they need to pay even more.
Advertisements, if they are relevant and not spam, can be useful. For example, if I'm searching for "buy iPhone" then it's okay if it's a list of advertisements as long as they are the best place to buy it.
But if it's just a spam link with nothing special, I would expect it to get down voted and removed.
In other words, I don't distinguish ads from any other type of content, and they have to compete with position just like everyone else.
If you really loved the ranking results, you wouldn't care what the motivations are.

Once new users are educated about decentralization and trustless peer-to-peer currency then they certainly will become weary and cautious about who owns what.

I think bitcoin.org would look very different already if he was bought by Ver a while ago. Got any evidence?
@_date: 2018-07-27 06:00:14
I think it's more a matter of convenience and consistency. It doesn't have to be bitcoin.org but historically it's been a good place for me to tell people to learn about Bitcoin and grab the software. I'm not sure what Cobra gains from holding on to the domain name (maybe sell it for $ later?) but it seems like if he/she owns actual BTC then it would be favorable to increase adoption by making bitcoin.org a more trustworthy site long-term. 
When I promote Bitcoin to my friends, I currently tell them bitcoin.org is a good place to go. But since that can change at any time on Cobra's whim, I am actually considering telling them to go to another more community-managed site.
I don't think it's right to wrestle someone's property (whether it's BTC or domain names) from another person. I just would have thought that if it's in the benefit to Cobra directly to encourage what Bitcoin is today (and what BCash is not) to voluntarily give control to the community. But that's his/her choice, and respect that decision.
Because I don't want to tell my friends to go to bitcoin.org then later tell them, "sorry guys that site changed their views" and go somewhere else later and confusing them further, I think a good website with the foundation to stand long-term for what the consensus will be at any given time is important.
In other words, we should start thinking of what site we want new users to go to long-term that won't have these issues of singular powerful middlemen. I mean, isn't that what Bitcoin is all about?

Financial revolution takes effort. Just as it would be easier to buy weed if it was legal, people had to resort to more difficult means of obtaining it for a long time.
But, through petition and fight against government policy, things are changing on that front.
The same should be done with Bitcoin and financial transactions. The war on terror and the war on money laundering shouldn't tread on our human right for privacy. And so, with enough petitioning and effort and time, that can change too.
In the meantime, you'll have to go through a bit more effort to obtain Bitcoin without an ID. But that's life with a government that enjoys it's monopoly on money and loves it's inflation and loves keeping a close eye on everybody.

As someone who was around Bitcoin before Coinbase existed, there were many fears about what it meant to have a corporation that has so many ties to existing regulatory and banking systems. Would they be supporters of the decentralized vision? Or would they quickly succumb to the type of control typical of most centralized entities either by forced compliance or by greed?
It didn't take long to know the answer to that.
First, was their inclusion of a phishing scheme called BCash as if it was legitimate. They either didn't do their homework and were ignorant, or had business ties to it. Either way, it was a clear sign they were failing.
Second, was their lackluster attempt at protecting the privacy of their users. They are now happy to report users to the IRS, both via the summons and via proactive actions of reporting trades as if they were a typical brokerage. Rather than side with customers, and prefer to shut down and burn their data, they preferred to sell out their customers in order to survive. It may have been the correct business move, but the incorrect moral move.
And Bitcoin, without the principles, is worthless. Coinbase has proven to only be about making a buck, and has no respect or loyalty to it's customers or to the purpose of Bitcoin's entire point of existing.
Coinbase was initially a good on-ramp for dollar to bitcoin conversion, but now, it is probably doing more harm than good. Even if Coinbase has accelerated the price of Bitcoin by making it easier for people to "invest", at what cost?
If we lose what Bitcoin is, we might as well be PayPal. And that is not what I signed up for.

And that is whether you are doing things legitimately or not. Regardless of which side of the fence you play, your life will be more difficult in such ways.

No, every other crypto currency does not try to steal the name. Ethereum is not "Bitcoin Ether" and Litecoin is not "Bitcoin Lite". That's what makes "Bitcoin Cash" a phishing scheme, and deliberately trying to take the name itself.
The congestion you talk about would exist in every cryptocurrency, but only Bitcoin has the transaction volume to be affected by it. And it's blazing new trails in that sense. The others will need to solve the problem someday, but because very few people use them today, they haven't hit that issue. But when they do, they will likely COPY exactly what Bitcoin did to solve the problem.
In that sense, Bitcoin is technically superior because it's solving problems that all others will only have in the future. From a technology stand-point, the race isn't even a close one.

Bitcoin is antifragile. Nothing can destroy it's fungibility, as it will work to create more fungibility in newer releases.

Sure, like they did with alcohol during prohibition, or with marijuana users, or with safe injection site users or any drug user. They *should* treat people who did things right like gold, but that's the exact point of what Bitcoin comes from - the fact that the government doesn't do things right. And there are plenty of Bitcoin people who decided to get into it precisely because they wanted to stop taking crap from their own government. 
So whenever there's a post about "report your taxes! do the right thing!" sure - do it. But don't complain when you get punished for doing the right thing. Too many of us here would shake our heads, because that's what Bitcoin is actually about. It isn't about over-9000 memes and roller-coaster and moon. It's about the fact that the government has been dishing crap for as long as government has existed. And I'm not saying we don't need government, but we also don't need to sit on our ass. If you're lazy, buy Bitcoin. It helps. If you're not lazy, buy Bitcoin AND push your political representatives for fair treatment for Bitcoin users.

First of all, don't use blockchain.com or coinbase.com.
Second of all, don't trust anyone who demands your private information.
Third of all, check out the sidebar that has answers to a lot of common questions.

"Do you take &lt;worthless item X&gt; in lieu of payment?"
If Bitcoin was valuable, you wouldn't trade it for anything. You would hoard it. And if you absolutely *had* to part with it after exhausting all other options, you would try to replace it immediately by buying more of it. Would it stop you from buying things you need? No, of course not. You need to pay living costs, pay for entertainment, eat food. But I think rationally you *should* spend the constantly inflating US dollar before parting with your _precious_ limited digital resource.
Once business owners start seeing the light, and seeing how they are idiotically putting themselves into an economically disadvantageous situation by collecting huge sums of constantly inflating dollars, they will change their minds about accepting Bitcoin. At that moment, Bitcoin becomes even more valuable than before.
However, for business owners who have yet to see the light, you will only give the impression that Bitcoin is a worthless item to you that you are so willing to part ways with it as soon as you can. And a typically skeptical business owner does not wish to be fooled by you.
Maybe what you should say instead, while paying US dollars, is tell them, "I am so glad you accept this worthless government paper instead of my Bitcoins. I get to keep my Bitcoins, thank you so much!" and walk away with a smile.

Bitcoin is still tiny. Once it's big, it won't fluctuate much.

It's absolutely amazing that Bitcoin was, and continues to be, sufficiently principled that a hard fork invalidating the stolen coins was not unanimously supported by a large group of people.
As painful as it is to the MtGox users, this is why Bitcoin shines and has billions of times more value than any altcoin. Even though it's nothing more than a protocol enforced by peer-to-peer nodes, who could be potentially motivated to circumvent large portions of the group, the nodes have done the "right thing". Perhaps it's because, someday, they don't want to be on the wrong side of a fork invalidating their coins that some kind of majority of people claim is invalid against their own will.
And this also shows to me that a nearly morally imperative fork that would have saved a lot of early adopters all this pain of loss was never created, yet a hodgepodge airdrop and contentious hard fork such as BCash or BUnlimited or B2X all became part of the conversation over something far less morally imperative. It goes to show me how exceedingly worthless such ideas to fork Bitcoin really are - and how much Bitcoin shines again.
Bitcoin is light years ahead of any other coin in terms of what it has established itself to be. Nothing can claim greater decentralization and resistance to centralized control.

Is it unhealthy to catch a cold once in a while? Is it unhealthy to feel sore after exercising?
I think the economy needs a shot of reality. Bitcoin is not a bubble, it's the pin.

The US economy was far more stable before the central bank was created ~1913. As soon as it was invented, there was the great depression ~1929 and endless economic cycles of downturn and upturn that correlate exactly to the printing (not literally, but economically) of new money. This continues today.
We never needed a central bank. It was a power grab, a successful one, and has put democracy at risk. Many people say democracy has failed completely, but Bitcoin is a glimmer of hope in putting SOME economic fairness back into the system.
For that reason, Bitcoin is priceless in my opinion. Yes, the same could be said about any cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin has the best chance to achieve this in my experience with it so far.

I think it's somehow appropriate that George Washington was once the president of a very high denomination bill called the dollar, worth 100 cents. And it was by the destruction of principles of sound money that we also reduced the value of a dollar so that it's almost worthless, to great disrespect of the first president.

Bitcoin is a financial revolution disguised as a get rich quick scheme.
If more people use bitcoin because of the price, smart people who use it for the merits will benefit automatically.
It's inevitable that price talk reigns supreme with the masses. If people were always morally and intelligently motivated, we wouldn't have 95% of the problems in the world today.
Let's just help move the herd into the daily price thread. We are the sheep dogs.

The Ethereum community had collectively decided to call the hard fork "Ethereum". In a software sense, Ethereum classic follows the original pre-fork protocol. Whether the name change is right or wrong is a matter of opinion. But Ethereum classic is not so much a debate about technology, but rather policy. And this is one of the reasons why I am still a proponent of Bitcoin. And that is, Ethereum classic stands for immutability for morally questionable centralized governance. In Ethereum, decentralization lost and became Ethereum classic. 
In Bitcoin, decentralization is still winning. Despite opportunity after opportunity of invalidating ill-gotten or stolen coins (e.g. MtGox, SilkRoad, Bitcoin Ransomware, accidentally lost coins, etc.) the attitude and policy remains stronger than ever. The fundamental principles have not yet been bent to favor fixing unwanted transactions over decentralization. And that is really important. More important than anything, in my opinion, if you want to call it money and not "magic credits".
The fact that Ethereum changed in order to "rob" (or in their opinion, "fix") a person's balance, tells me everything I need to know about their fundamental beliefs. I am not interested in a system that isn't bound by both immutable mathematics and by immutable wallet balances.
What's the point if someday, either a central power or a collective power decides, "meh, I don't like you. I'm going to make your bank balance $0."?
And BCash is so far to the centralized spectrum of things that it even makes Ethereum seem good.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:16:56
It actually doesn't work both ways.
Bitcoin is a consensus-based protocol. When an alternative protocol is created that is not compatible with the existing protocol, the alternative is called a fork. BCash is an entirely new protocol that has larger blocks and incompatible with all of the Bitcoin nodes that existed before BCash was invented.
Bitcoin, before BCash existed, continues to be compatible with the thousands of Bitcoin nodes that worked and still work today despite all the changes that allowed for new features to be introduced.
On top of that, the 400+ developers that worked to build what Bitcoin is before BCash existed, continue to develop on what Roger and other scammers call "Core". There is no "Core", it's just Bitcoin.
The alternative, BCash, is a fork and a phishing scheme intended to deceive unsuspecting users. There are many fraud attacks on Bitcoin that are not related to Bitcoin. Just like there are scams on Ebay or Facebook, there are many in the Bitcoin world.
As problematic as they are, there are two advantages that Bitcoin have over BCash. And that is, technical superiority in the form of incredible developers, and the internet - where fraud schemes get exposed and ridiculed in the long run. That includes the banking system, corrupt government programs, etc. as long as people are diligent. Information is so easy to find these days, and illogical or inferior arguments will get crushed over time.

It has not only resisted every attack on it so far, it has become stronger from it.

* What if your friend is using one of those currency checking pens manufactured in China?
* What if your friend is looking up the current paper security features of the $20 published by the U.S. government website?
* What if you need to check that the $20 wasn't inflated (yet again) to make sure you don't actually need to pay them $25 instead?
* What if you need to verify that this $20 isn't a high-resolution photocopy?
* What if you need to check if the currency hasn't completely destabilized like in Venezuela?
* What if the $20 came from a bank ATM that may freeze your account?
There's always validation and external dependencies. The question is how much is under the control by powerful people using their power and politics for personal gain, versus something that doesn't depend on trust?
