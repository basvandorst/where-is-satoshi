I think the ups and downs will be a big part of the Bitcoin life-cycle for the next few years or so. Rick Falkvinge gives an excellent talk on Youtube about the amount of time it takes a disruptive technology to gain maximum usability. 
I think we are still at a stage where the interest in Bitcoin will keep coming in peaks and troughs, just that when it 'crashes' it will be at a higher price than it was at the last one. I still think that traditional banking will be finished unless it innovates and embraces bitcoin though

Amazon would be amazing! It's popularity would go through the roof, although I think they've tried to go it on their own with the Amazon coin lol
Id like Google to take up the mantle that baidu put down and use it for google ad words

I think they'd be a pretty harsh smoke :)

I know, hopefully though the more legalisation takes off the cheaper they will become :)

And ours are cheaper than the vast majority of other websites. For example we sell Seedsman's seeds cheaper than they actually do themselves!
In general new strains from the big seedbanks tend to be more expensive as they have a monopoly on the strain. Winning cups tends to push the price up as well. Personally I would go for an already established  strain as they become cheaper the longer they have been around.
