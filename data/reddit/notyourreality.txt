Also, I used to work for ISPs. I know how the infrastructure works. Here's [Level 3's North American backbone]( Shut down this network, AT&amp;T, UUNet, MCI and a few others and all Internet traffic stops. You don't have to shut down every computer. You just have to shut down the major systems that all traffic is routed through. This is partly what the "Net Neutrality" fight has been about. If they can shape or filter your traffic, they can can shut it down if they want to. The Internet is not in the hands of a bunch of unconnected, freedom-loving patriots. It's controlled by massive corporations who do whatever the Government tells them to do.

Technology can only disrupt to the extent that those in power will let it. In a case like MP3s, the music industry got screwed but, the rest of the world was fine so most Governments didn't intervene. But, central banking is the sacred bull of modern culture. You don't fuck with central bankers and get away with it. Governments WILL get involved to protect them. How do you think Governments get their funding? It's all connected.

No, but the Internet can. The problem w/ the current system is that it relies on infrastructure that it regulated (and ultimately controlled) by Governments and Corporations. Case-in-point: I had some Bitcoin on BTC-e... now, I don't. Having gazillions of Bitcoins with no means to trade or exchange them is like finding a huge stash of gold on the moon. It's only worth something if you can trade or convert it to something tangible. With no Internet service &amp; no web servers Bitcoin (and other cryptos) is basically worthless. Government controls the Internet.

Do you know what [peering]( is? Your ISP doesn't just randomly bounce TCP packets around and hope they eventually reach their destination. All traffic is passed through a VERY small amount of [IXPs]( and networks. It doesn't matter if the Internet in India or Germany is working. If the US Govt. tells all the US ISPs to stop network traffic then nothing gets in or out.


Bitcoin was an experiment cooked up by the NSA/CIA to see what would happen to a cryptocurrency in the wild. (Proof? Who is Satoshi?) It's been a great success. Now, the Federal Reserve is [thinking]( about getting into the game. Some day, the major banks will issue a new type of "FedCoin" and make all other cryptocurrencies an instrument of terrorism. You will get a 100% premined coin from the likes of [JP Morgan]( and [Citibank]( Your current cryptos will instantly become illegal and/or worthless.


Declare it to be illegal and used for Terrorism. They tell all US banks to stop doing business with exchanges that sell Bitcoin. The IRS goes after anyone using it in the USA. They tell the ISPs to traffic shape all public ports used for Bitcoin and block DNS of anything that looks like a Bitcoin Exchange.

And, when you connect to your ISP, you get to tell them what networks they can &amp; can't block for you? You own the hardware in their datacenter? If they blocked something would you even know? Without DHCP and an IP address from your ISP, you're not doing anything online. You just assume you'll always connect.

My guess is that is a backup for Chicago. If something ever happened to Chicago (eg. the stock exhange), they could route through Indiana. They also have UIndy and Purdue Universities.


1. President enables legal action via an executive order.
2. Government agencies contact main backbone ISPs and tell them to stop service.
3. Major backbone ISPs follow orders and discontinue service for 98% of Americans.
4. For additional control, they could also shut down traffic to root DNS servers. (Hopefully you've memorized the IP addresses of every site you like to visit?)
With no backbone traffic / peering and no DNS, the Internet is effectively useless. The MAJORITY of Internet traffic flows between certain points of connection and are handed off between networks.

All traffic flows through [Internet Exchange Points]( (IXP). All of this runs on [hardware switches]( A system administrator (sysadmin) has access to the entire network of these hardware switches. By initiating a software program (or script) the sysadmin can shut down all of the hardware switches. They can also re-route ISP traffic wherever they want it to go. Instead of allowing traffic to pass through a network, they can set a flag telling the sender that the network is rejecting all traffic. Sort of a "404" message telling other routers &amp; switches: "I'm not available. Please try again later." Many of the data centers also have Internet-connected power supplies. A sysadmin can connect to the power supply remotely and issue a shut down command to power down the system. In a worst-case-scenario they can physically press the power button and shut them down. If 5-10 of the MAJOR ISP networks in the USA shut down their IXP switches, all the traffic would effectively stop. You wouldn't be able to connect to anything.

You assume I know nothing about crypto? I've been holding Bitcoin since 2011. I fully understand blockchain tech. 
Having wild-eyed visions of grandeur won't allow you to take control of the system. Bitcoin (and all cryptos) have a single-point-of-failure: Internet access. Everyone always assumes that free, open and always-on Internet will always exist. 
Unless that revolutionary spirt does something to secure that "right" then it could easily disappear. I advocate decentralized and 100% open systems free from Government or Corporate intervention.

MP3s don't need Internet to play but, you need Internet to search, download and share files. You are delusional if you think the record companies "disappeared from the business". Spotify pays them a license fee. You will also not win against central banks, I assure you. You control nothing.

Nope. I never watched it. But, maybe that's why they made it? If you can take a real life situation and write a TV show about it people will be more likely to take the real life situation less seriously. It's called "preconditioning". 


Yep. You're idealistic. Someday you'll wonder: "Why did we ever trust them? The warning signs were everywhere."

They don't need to shut down all the computers. The MAJORITY of your Internet traffic flows between a few hardware networks. Everytime you type a domain name the DNS is "looked up" via the root servers. You shut down the major ISPs switching traffic and shut off DNS and you've effectively killed the Internet for 98% of the people.

Without the Internet, software is useless. Cryptocurrency is 100% dependent on the Internet. People just assume it will always be there and let them do whatever they want. It won't be &amp; your access will be filtered.
The record companies did something INGENIOUS with MP3s: they convinced everyone that Spotify and Cloud Music was better. You never actually OWN anything, you just rent it. Someday, when the Internet goes down, you won't even be able to listen to all that great music you like because you never really owned it. But, the guys who downloaded actual MP3s from Napster will still be listening to it locally.
