Dude, same coin she was hyping to me. I talked to her on the phone. She’s a real person. They are commuting resources to this. Funny, I jokingly said I would send her BTC to buy me some (no intention of doing that, just flirting and bla bla) and she didn’t take me up on. Wish I could post a screen shot of what she sent me about that coin. Guess they know BTC is mostly male and INCEL hahaha. Thank you for posting this cause I was scratching my head

Omg, that’s heated. Nuts. Did she send you screen shots of her wallets? How many BTC did she say she had? Mine has 57BTC. Maybe it’s one person with many profiles

I’m not giving up on boning her just yet hahaha. My shits in cold storage, she can hack and do her worst. She won’t get my coins but I might get that ass hahahaha

Can you screenshot and post their pic? I just met one too. We actually talked on the phone, she said she wants to come to one of my shows. I’m super suspicious too but I’ve met enough girls off tinder to know how to protect myself and still get laid. But I’m wondering if it’s the same girl. Her profile was kinda of BTC boosty. Was her name Jessica by chance?

Same exchange too. She sent that link. Looking at the messages now

I dunno if you’ve tried to buy this much but it’s not just forms. The amount of info they want I’m surprised they aren’t asking for a sperm sample at this point

I’m not trying to avoid taxes. I’m trying to buy it with a phone call and wire transfer as opposed to the ten thousand hoops of the exchange
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:10:39
How do you mean?

I have my orange coin but it won’t be too helpful if this is end democracy and we slip into martial law when this bitch comes down. I second wood hut

I know, everyone is like 10% mark up.  Pleabs.  Buy in bulk equals lower price.  I didn't know Trace does OTC. Does he have a company or do I just go to his website?

I dunno, the rise of all the authoritarian people to power around the country -including the USA and now UK- is worrying. When FUD hits the main stream people hand the keys to anyone promising stability and strength

That’s kind of interesting, it forces you to DCA in. I like this idea ❣️
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:22:52
Thank you! Link please?
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:44:48
Normally when you buy in bulk you get a discount ��
@_date: 2019-08-18 05:10:49
That sucks cause it looks like an awesome exchange :/ Too bad it's such low volume and liquidity.

DCA = dollar cost average

Well bitcoin being invented as a hedge and alt to the global financial system makes me think it’s not the wrong sub. What the market does effects BTC. Thought the crypto community would enjoy my findings
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:12:18
No not that, surprisingly.
@_date: 2019-08-04 14:26:58
That’s what I wonder too. I feel like MMT will be end game. I’m tempted to buy some index’s and ride the last of the greatest pump and dump in history. Then again maybe just wait.  I’ve got my bitcoin but I’m not going 100% into crypto cause that’s too hardcore for even me.  WHAT TO DO. Will it crash, won’t it crash. Ooooo, it feels like prom all over
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:48:24
Not the triangle. I just didn’t feel like deleting that trend line. But the dip

You flagged me??? ������ omg. Hands cramping from rocking the incel chat too hard had to do something else with your time? Alts relate to BTC, dog. If alts have bottomed then BTC might have too. Lay if the youporn and learn to read chart correlations
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:51:00
Ha! It’s all the same market. The alts give you insight to what BTC might do. I’m a  Maximalist but I don’t pretend like the alts don’t exist. LTC has front run BTC for 8 months now. Also, the alts sub wouldn’t let me post it and I’m very proud of my discovery. See you in the incel chat room, bud!

Certainly don’t want to use PayPal. Any of these still working and legit?
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:19:59
Does it have any affiliation with a bank? Or is it it’s own thing that financial institutions can come in and freeze your money or do all the other things banks love to do? Like, is it linked to your personal wallet, or do you store your coins on their wallet?
