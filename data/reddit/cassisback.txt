hah, no. I *like* the system of government we have set up. And no, your ideas are not at all "alien" just... silly. Impractical.
And no, I am not going to go out of my way to read about political systems that I have no interest in partaking in. "anarcho capitilizm is not good policy, Business need some sort of oversight.
Take for example: Oil spills and oil fraking. If oil compies where self regulated, they would not bother undergoing safety procedures and what not. History has tought us this. 
And what happens when oil companies screw up? Well, massive ecological damage, that's what.

what is mpex.co?
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:56:20
 You had better back that up with some proof, because from where I am standing that is definitly not the case.
Again, see my example of the oil spills. "the free market" does not give a shit about that kind of thing.
Businesses need oversight that does not come from a "what about the bottem line" perspective. Because there is more then just money at stake here.

And that retort wont be nearly as effective, because the people you will be talking to use cash. 
The whole reason that works is it is sort of othering people who use bitcoins, subliminally saying "only criminals use bitcoins".
And the retort wont be nearly as effective, because you cant other yourself. "I am not a criminal, and I use cash" will be what runs in the back of their minds.
Ach, I dont know. Maybe it wont happen, maybe it will. Who knows. I guess it all depends on how the news first breaks to the mainstream for good. Eventually something is going to happen that will thrust bitcoin into the public eye, and it will be that event and how the media portrays it, I think, that will determin the public perception of the bitcoin.

Oh, I have read about that in Little Brother, Bayesian Statistics, right.
But some unlucky sap has to get the spam and report it, right?

I dont really care what the naysayers say, even if it fails, bitcoin is such an *awesome* idea.
The skeptic in me refuses to put anything more then a few bucks in it, but the nerd in me wants to roll around in the stuff.

im sure there is. somewhere. Over the rainbow maybe.

In the short run, for sure, but in the long run... I dont know. Bitcoin already has its detractors, and one of their most persuasive arguments is going to be "look at all these drugs and guns and porn people are buying with bitcoin!"
Maybe this wont be a big deal, maybe it will be. But even if it is not a very good argument, saying "its mostly used to buy drugs" is certainly a *persuasive* argument against bitcoin. Much like saying "think of the children!" 
I think that if too many people start connecting bitcoin to the silk road, in the long run it will hinder the bitcoins integration into the mainstream marketplace.

No, it wont be. There is no "voluntary" for the severlly mentally handicapped or the insane, and the stupid wont submit, they will hear the words "you rule yourself" and will just do whatever the fuck they want.
What? How are you going to make people subscribe to "voluntarism"? And how would that get rid of finiachail coercion?
And you mention courts and police, but who do they awnser to? How do you fight against corruption? How do you make sure they are intrepting the law correctly? Who decideds who can become cops and judges? What about lawyers? 
If you are talking about like a commune with 50 people *at the most*, then sure, it could work, but otherwise you *need* some form of governing body to settle disputes, regulate trade, all that good stuff.
It sounds like you have this big plan in your head, and I can see why, its always fun to daydream about how you could fix things if you where in charge.
But this is real life. And in real life, things dont work out like that.

While this is true, you would be surprised by just how many people I have talked to did not know this about Paypal at all, thinking that PayPal was like a bank and could not just arbitrarily freeze your funds (even though, from what I understand banks can do this). 
Thats what happens when you dont real the TOS, I guess.
