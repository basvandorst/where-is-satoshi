Sure, if they can actually manage to get it out of the exchanges. 
Hmm, this USDT seems about right and don’t have to work out how (if even) I can withdraw back to a bank account.
Phew, out of the market! All safely in USDT until the exchange fixes its withdrawal “issues”

Well when you put it like that, ... no I mean sure. There’s a chance they won’t fuck it up.

Isn't that more what ripple is about?

You gave your bitcoin to mtgox. Who lost/stole it.
That is the same as if you had given your cash to some guy who said he would keep it safe for you (even less safe really). Bitcoin exchanges, or anyone who takes your coins with a promise that you still own them are completely unregulated. 
The mistake is thinking of MtGox as a fiat-money bank with laws and regulations. It's not a failure of BitCoin. Just people confusing the features of bitcoin and the blockchain, with organisations involved in bitcoin. 
One has cryptographic trust, the other is just a promise.
Keep your coins in your own wallets. Move small amounts to exchanges you think you can trust, for the minimum time needed to make the exchange you want.

It probably was, but that is because the people who made the call thought the average citizen would need a simple explanation for complex issues. Much like the one you are defending.

Hence, "fork"

ITT: people with no browser discipline.  
Search/site - open tabs. Read tabs, save to pinboard if useful later, read later tag if too much to read now. Make notes in nvalt if solved a problem. CLOSE tab.  
New tangent, new window (not tab).  
Nothing stays open if not "in use" or "in process queue".  
Too long with too many tangents? Kill the whole session and go for a walk.  If you remember you really need something it's in your history.  
Long-running Web Apps (Gmail, JIRA etc), use a site specific browser with an icon in dock/task bar. Separate from your "browsing".

As long as it is profitable to do so, obviously.

Stealing them in a way that doesn't remove them from the store's possession ...
How have I stolen anything when you still have it, now I just have it too?
