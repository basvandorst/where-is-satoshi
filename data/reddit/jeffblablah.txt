It is in US. They have something called MISCO in EU but those know nothing about Bitcoin.
PS! I was really excited about BTC before I actually attempted to use it for something serious. My excitement is disappearing fast.

as I can buy anything with potatoes. Only thing I have to do is sell potatoes and use cash. Right...

I am not feeling that "btc is so widly accepted" you are talking about. 
For example, I am attempting to buy a TV and a laptop with BTC in EU. Guess what, it's not going well because I cant find a shop that sells what I want for BTC. (see:  )
Maybe it's better in US but I do not care, I am in EU.  :) 
My point is, it's really hard to get everyday stuff without fiat and banks.

what private information? They don't even have my e-mail address. :)

Xapo is in US and hence utterly useless for me. I understand you guys US have all the shit you need to use bitcoin but how is this helping me in EU? IT IS NOT!

but rest of the planet knows nothing nor cares about your absurd turkey day :)
BTW, did you know that this bogus holiday was invented by turkey farmers to boost the sales before winter and get rid of all the old birds.

Why did you left out it's an American Express credit card and made it sound like ANY bank card? Did you even **R**ead **T**he **F**ucking **A**rticle? 
Original headline: "A $10 Tool Can Guess (And Steal) Your Next Credit Card Number"
and while we are at it: "Kamkar admits that his attack **can’t, however, access the victim’s four-digit CVV from the back of the card**, which reduces the number of businesses where it can be used."
