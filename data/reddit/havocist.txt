How would that work? Wouldn't it still take an unfeasable amount of computing power to do that before another miner found a working nonce?

So it would be easy to create a new address on a device, move the amount to that address, and then give the merchant that address and the private key. But this would require the merchant to trust that the customer has the right amount at that address, right?

Which highlights another disparity with bitcoin transactions: they are a push transaction whereas modern commerce is based on a pull transaction. I have a pool of money available for transactions (my credit card balance), and merchants perform a pull from that pool.
With bitcoin, I would have to scan or enter the merchants wallet code, and then enter how much to push to that wallet. (Then wait for it to propogate). 
This problem seems like a pretty big barrier to bitcoin gaining wider acceptance and use (and a potential big market for the first person to come up with a solution).

I think I'm bumping up against the limit of my knowledge of bitcoin here.


So there is a way to see independently that the transaction has been initiated even if the 6 confirmations haven't happened yet? That would seem to solve the problem, as long as the network is trusted.

Thanks, that's precisely what I meant.

I'm thinking out loud here:
I don't necessarily want pull transactions. I'm interested in how bitcoin could become more widely usable and accepted, and that means developing a UX that anyone can intuitively understand. Smartphones will become ubiquitous and most will one day be equipped with NFC (or an equivalent technology) making a purely digital currency a viable option. I'm a developer and love learning about how a block is created and tracked, but most people would rather not know.
The problem of not having instant transaction approval is an initial barrier to entry for most consumers, and one that's solved by a pull transaction through a trusted third party. This allows a payment to be made the instant of purchase, even if in reality funds aren't transferred for days. Without fully understanding the technology behind bitcoins (I'm halfway through devouring the wiki), I was looking for a way that instant transactions could be made on top of the core bitcoin functionality by using the network as the trusted entity.
