Yea, but they also had to keep each individual persons funds separate and not commingled in a cold storage wallet, AFAIK.  If this can be argued to be individual storage then they may have to pay up to 250k per person.

I just finished watching the lectures for week one.  Took me about 6 hours, but I fully watched them and rewatched many parts to slow it down.  I also took notes so that slowed it down considerably.  I am assuming the quiz and programming assignment (optional) will take another 4-6 hours.  So realistically about 10 hours if you really are trying to pay attention and learn. I have a degree in the hard sciences so I am familiar with learning difficult concepts.
Of course if you just want to watch the lectures at 1.5X speed you could do that in about 60-90 minutes per week, but you won't get as much out of it.

Coinbase is getting there as well.  Bought a Humble Bundle today and chose bitcoin as my payment.  Entered my email to get the humble bundle so they immediately ask me if I want to send the bticoin from my Coinbase account with the same email.  Said yes, entered my 2FA and was done.  As easy as if I was paying with my paypal account that was integrated into a website.  They even ask you if you want to repurchase the bitcoins.

You are not only investing in bitcoin but the whole development team and infrastructure being built around it.  No other coin can compete with this.  Anybody can create a cryptocurrency but nobody will take it serious because of this.   
Also,  almost anything that other feature that is deemed better by other coins can be implemented into the bitcoin code.  Bitcoin code is fluid and is constantly being improved with new features (i.e. Payment protocol,  multisig, etc)

You have to understand that most people on that sub reddit are brand new to trading and TA and therefore have no clue what they are doing.  Put a couple fancy indicators on the chart to make it look pretty and say it is going here or there lol. IMO technical analysis does have its merit, if used correctly in the long term and by keeping it simple with S&amp;R lines (area's) and long term highs/lows.  That's really all you need. Add a simple indicator in there if you want for for confimation of an entry point, but that's it.  Also, you are never always going to be 100% correct (not even close), it's just a matter of having the odds slightlyy in your favor and knowing when to pull the trigger and when to get out of a losing trade or protecting your gains.
edit: the usual stats that get bandied about are that 90%-95% of traders are long term losers.  keep that in mind when reading that subreddit

Pretty similar here. Except not as high as 1100.  Bought first big chunk at around 100, watched them run up to 1200 but didn't buy or sell.  Once it came back down to 800 I've been buying in small quantities all over the 500-800 range.  Those buys at 100 allow for a nice low cost basis and keeps the emotion out of these wild swings

It's really not that bad.  Use strong passwords and keep a clean computer and you should be fine!  If you surf a lot of suspect websites, then it might be worth your while to get a cheap laptop for the purposes of bitcoin and don't visit any shady places on it.  IF you have what you consider A LOT, then go ahead and make a paper wallet for long term storage (savings), but other than that, just use any of the major wallets out there in which you control your own keys (coinbase does not count, although it is fine for purchasing).  
Personally I have my main savings chunk spread over a couple cold paper wallets.  The rest I have split up between bitcoin core, electrum, blockchain.info wallet and mycelium.  Just get keepass to organize and generate strong passwords.
If you're not using deterministic wallets like electrum, then you will also have to backup your private keys.  they all make it easy to do so and I like to save these to an encrypted Truecrypt folder for safe keeping.  Probably a little excessive though.
I think getting hacked and your coins stolen is almost as common as getting robbed walking the street would be.  Sure, it might happen but chances are it wont, and if you take the basic precautions and don't act like an idiot (waving around hundred dollar bills in a shady part of town) the chances are even less.
Also, another tip is to practice will small amounts.  You need to get a hang of transferring coins, etc.  A lot of things are fool proof right now, but nothing would be worse than wanting to send 0.95btc so someone, but instead sending them 0.05btc and the 0.95btc to the miners lol.  If you're using paper wallets check out how change addresses work, although IMO paper wallets should only be used for longer term storage.

Not bad at all considering how small the bitcoin community is currently.  
Having about 1 billions in annual sales (~2.7 million a day), that accounts for almost 5% of total sales (based on averages).  I think as bitcoin adoption increases, that number will increase over time along with Overstock's savings. Mind you though, that $124k number is a little inflated as a lot people just bought something as a show of support in the first day.

Until recently, I never used an exchange.  I accumulated bticoin from people by trade or exchange directly.  I use it to buy all kinds of stuff (miners, cryptocards, electronics, gift cards to buy groceries, donations, etc).  You could argue that buying gift cards is through a third party, but not really since I deal directly with Gyft for that purchase and then directly with Whole Foods for the groceries.  As it stands, I could buy most of my weekly needs with bitcoin right now and that will only improve as the infrastructure gets built out in the coming months and years.  You should try it!

Best way to get frictionless bitcoin is to find somebody willing to pay you in bitcoin for an item or do a service for them. It's hard now since bitcoin is not used by most people but in the future that may change.  Also you could use localbitcoins to find someone in your area from which you could buy from

Some good talks thus far.... anybody watching/listening?  The investor panel I thought as the most interesting so far (first two panels).  Was hoping to get some insight to what they were looking at as up coming companies in the area but they were pretty tight lipped about anything that wasn't publicly known already.  The decentralized apps panel with V.Buterin and Johnston and Snyder was a bit discombobulated and fragmented, but I guess you would expect that as these guys are not publuc speakers and investors like the others.

I agree. Bitcoin is to difficult to deal with and understand right now for the average person. It's a long way from mainstream adoption but companies like circle will help greatly with that.  Nobody I know really cares about bitcoin and all my friends are tech friendly. To be honest I can see why too. There is just no benefit for the average first world person. What bitcoin will greatly benefit I'd third world ppl that don't have access to banking and money.  In the first world it might benefit large companies if they can deal with their suppliers in bitcoin.  Saving a couple percent in fees is huge when your dealing in billions of dollars. But for the average middle class tech friendly person there is really no reason to use bitcoin other than idealistic reasons

I would argue the opposite.  Short term trading is just throwing darts blind.  Your are trading the noise.

That's been said the whole way down from 1,200.  Personally, I would wait until we see a longterm reversal before dumping a bunch of cash in. Basically if we can hold this low here at 420 and break back above 520, I would then be bullish.  Right now we are still in the trend of making lower low's and lower high's on the daily and weekly charts.  Not very bullish IMO. Hopefully you're right though.

That advertisment idea with Andreas would be a great I think, given all parties involved are willing and able.
Also, I'm not sure how deep your contacts are from your 10 years experience, but use your contacts from working with these A-list actors. As far as I know a lot of these actors have charities and do work overseas to help the poor (Angelina Jolie, Clooney, etc).  If you have any contacts with any actors that do work in poor countries and have charities over there, then do something to promote bitcoin to the 6 billion unbanked people through these actors (might be a long shot)

Because the spread on coinbase is slightly larger than that on circle (from what I've seen) plus coinbase charges a 1% fee

All these new wallets (wallet 2.0's) coming up are looking promising and should help to speed adoption.  I think the current technically looking and not so user friendly wallets currently available are quite intimidating to the average person.  Even my friends, who are in their late 20's/early 30's haven't or don't seem to want to spend the time to learn all the ins and outs of bitcoin and the wallets.  We need these new generation of wallets to be the most secure and as simple as can be so people can use the technology without even knowing it

you're right, it is pretty half assed on my part.  Basically I just want to point out that line I have drawn at 537.  Ignore all other markings on the chart, they are there from previous excepted turning points.
On this line you will notice strong bounces or rejections back in November, December, Feb, March and April this indicating major interest in this area of price.  We are currently coming up to this area again.  If we can break through significantly, and hold above this level, then maybe come down and retest it, but bounce off, we will be in good shape and will have turned into long term bullish IMO.
In short, longterm wise, we are not bullish yet since we have not created a higher high on the daily charts.  Once we break the 520-530 area and create a new daily high, followed bu a retest of 520 that hold, that would be extremely bullish for me.  If we can't manage to break this 520-530 area and hold, then that is a continued bearish sign for me

I have been thinking of using greenaddress.it as my primary webwallet.  I haven't looked into it much yet but is this correct about the PIN: to access the wallet with a PIN, you need to be on a device that has the encrypted mnemonics already. So being only a 4 number PIN doesn't matter as you need to be using it on your specific device (unless an attacker somehow gets your mnemonics in which case they won't even need the PIN).  Also it says when you enter it wrong 3 times, the password is deleted from the servers.  In this case you would have to login using the full mnemonics, correct?  And when you do, would you get a new PIN/password?
Anyways, I think you guys are doing a good job. The only complaint I would have is that the android app is pretty slow.  I played around with it for a bit, but haven't checked it recently so maybe it has improved?

So true.

what these guys do not understand is that bitcoin is not for the average person.  He is right, currently there is no real good reason for someone in North America or Europe, etc to use bitcoin for daily purchase.  That probably will change with time and infrastructure.

I always feel bad about not donating to Wiki during their fundraisers since I do use it quite a lot (who doesn't). The reason is mainly out of pure lazyness of not wanting to go through paypal, credit cards, etc. With bitcoin I use the browser app Kryptokit which automatically detects the bitcoin address and so it literally takes about 5 seconds (enter amount and click) to send bitcoin. In fact I keep about $20 worth of bitcoin in there just to donate and give away. It's quite fun actually and I would definietly donate to Wikipedia if they accepted it. If I think about it, i would probably repeatedly donate small amounts throughout the year whenever I am spontaneously feeling generous

Couldn't agree more.  Lots of negativity and doom and gloom around.  Price is flailing.  Yet, nothing has changed with the underlying technology, in fact it has gotten quite better with recent BIP's and multisig software wallets, etc. Silicon Valley just had a huge positive conference and there are millions flowing into new start-ups in the bitcoin/crypto space.  I'm not calling a bottom as it could definitely keep going down a bit, but if you believe in bitcoin long term, the it's a really good time to start buying again IMO

Good summary of all the different circumstances due to this new ruling. I didn't know that Utah has made it legal to use gold at market value for transactions without having to pay capital gains.  Obviously this is just a ruling on bitcoin and so hopefully in the future it will be revised, once they will realize that bitcoin is widely used as a currency for daily items, and having every transaction a taxable event really does nothing but hinder the evolution of this technology
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:27:37
You can buy now if you want. Definitely nothing wrong with that but PLEASE ask him to send you're coins to your own account, even if it's just coinbase as that is better than having some guy you sorta trust holding your shit.  You can even sit then in a vault in coinbase so even if your hacked it would take a day or two of emails and such for the coins to be transferred. Do that while you learn how to securely store them yourself
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:40:45

If we break the long term high then we will have made a higher low and a higher high on the daily chart. This indicates a change in trend to bullish. If you believe this to be true then a good time to buy in would be the retracement back down to the previous resistance level now turned support level.

Do you understand how much it costs to develop a drug? It costs billions for a company to research and then put through clinical trials a drug.  They have to recoup this money somehow to continue to do more research.  Chinese and Indian labs illegally take the chemical structure of the drug after it has been made public and make it, which in most cases does not cost a lot.  That's why those drugs are so cheap.  Plus there really is no quality control so you don't truly know what you're getting
Edit: what I am saying is the actual synthesis and making of the drug is not what costs money and which is why Indian labs can take the chemical structure and illegally make it cheap.  It's the 10 years of research and clinical trials that cost money
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:19:11
Ha yea, I'm not saying everytime there is a move one way or the other then it will immediately go the other way.  Take a look at any market though, especially the forex market.  Before any major move, there is a small quick move in the opposite direction. This is done usually to take out all the stop loss or stop buy orders resting above or below any recent short term high or low
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:01:54
Yea we need to pay the devs in a decentralized way. The fact that some of them are being paid by for profit companies is a huge conflict of interest
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:33:51
The cost is the bid/ask spread. If you take a look at this page at the top right corner you will see the spread: 
When you Buy from Coinbase, you are paying the Buy (higher) price and when you sell you are selling at the Sell (lower) price. The difference is about 0.5%-1%. 
Another way to think about it is if you were to buy bitcoin from Coinbase and instantaeously sell you bitcion, you would be paying that spread and lose 0.5%-1%
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:08:27
He could maybe keep half on coinbase and then send the other half to a wallet he controls.  Spread the risk out a bit, that's what I do

Indeed, I think a lot of it is the regulators trying to assert their power over the situation but at the same time you could say Coinbase was the one being disingenuous with their announcement of being the first regulated bitcoin exchange

@_date: 2014-05-05 14:01:06
Haha...take it slow and you should get it! Working in science, I read a lot of research papers and the trick it's too take it slow and not to get overwhelmed. I remember first starting out and not having a clue about what was just explained in a paper. It can be tough without the experience. Basically you will have to read, look up terms/concepts, re-read, etc, etc. Rarely can you make it through a research paper in one shot. Print them out helps me as well as I can make notes on the margins.
It takes time but in the end it's quite rewarding as you will have a much deeper understanding of the concepts. I would recommend everybody who is involved with bitcoin to read and fully understand at least the white paper. Depending on the person it can be quite technical, even though it's just scratching the surface, but definitely approachable to anybody willing to put in the time IMO.

While what you said is true, humble bundle has decided to remove bitcoin payments themselves currently.  I was wondering why there was no bitcoin option the past little while and so I asked a couple weeks ago.  They said that they have removed bitcoin as a payment due to some "negative issues" that were "affecting our business".  There was no info other than that, but they said that they are re-examining bitcoin payments for improvements but have no ETA yet.  Its a shame since I bought pretty much every bundle at the average price with bitcoin

Also, with a tech company he would be paid his salary plus benefits.  401k, pension, paid time off, health, etc, etc are a huge cost of employment, essentially meaning someone who makes $100k/year is really costing the employer $150-200k/year.  I could be wrong, but Gavin does not receive these things, through this contracting.  Please correct me if I am wrong

Those numbers mean nothing.  I could make a post saying I run a charity with those exact figures. Would you believe me?
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:21:24
Nope charities usually have oversight. As an example I could go to the site you believe gives them legitimacy and create my own open up my own "charity"

For a decentralized currency for the people, yes.  But that's basically the same process to buy stock.
You could also find someone willing to sell you some, or sell something for bitcoin.

Define generally accepted.  I do not accept Venezuelan Bolíva's yet it is a currency. I won't take Mexican Peso's because I have no use for them where I live.  There is a sub population that will accept Bitcoin all over the world, just like there is a sub population of people that will accept the Canadian dollar in Canada.  Yes I could accept most foreign currency and trade it into my local currency, with certain risk, but I could also do that with Bitcoin

I can't remember the deal but I bought a 760 GTX two years ago from newegg . It was a great deal though.  Something along the lines of spend $200 and get $100 off if you use bitcoin.

Nobody can predict future price.  If you're worried about buying into the top then just split your purchase into 10 segments and buy one a week or so
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:30:01
Cool.. I do understand the fact that transactions (and therefore addresses) are just a set of inputs and outputs.  I guess the biggest question I have is why does my blockchain wallet say I have received a total of 1.9995 bitcoins with 1 bitcoin sent when all I did was sweep in 1 bitcoin.  My previous explanation doens't make sense as the transaction fee is just the leftover from the inputs and outputs.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:11:13
OK, I think I found my answer!  So in my blockchain wallet, I had imported those paper wallet addresses into my blockchain wallet as 'watch only'.  Even though they were watch only, my block chain wallet 'transactions' and 'sent' and 'received' values included those addresses as well.  That is,  when I sent money from my paper address to my blockchain address, all the transactions occured in the same wallet.  So I received originally into my paper address then received again into my blockchain address which would explain why there was any amount sent in the first place and why the amount received was double what I was expecting.
 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:46:31
Huh?   Or use something as simple as 4.56 mbits solves that problem.   As mainstream adoption occurs there will be business's that are created that make it easy for the layman.  Do you think everyone knows what's really going on when they use their email or the Internet? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:17:13
when I login I see:
Total Transactions	15	
Total Received	0.24346952 BTC	
Total Sent	        0.12223476 BTC
Final Balance	0.12123476 BTC	
.....so I that total received the amount received from both the swept in paper wallets AND the current blockchain wallet?  That's the only way I can make sense of it.  And the transactions are all the transactions from the previous paper wallets and are now included into the blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:23:19
If you bought your bitcoin to gain profit by trading them, then there is nothing wrong with that!   One of the dumbest things you can do is not lock in profit and watch your gains dwindle back down to 0.  Regardless of what anybody says there is not one person in this world who knows with certainty where the price will be in a given amount is time.  
Have a plan and stick to it.  If you want 10% then take 10%.  If you want a small investment to hold for years, then do that.   Plan your trade and trade your plan
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:38:52
Very interesting metric.  I will have to think it over a bit more!  Is there any relationship to the days destroyed vs price movement for that day, or a given amount of time. For example stock volume a lot of time precedes price and a strong movement upwards on a high volume day could indicate a lot of strength and/or a nice base of new shareholders at support.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:03:06
This is the address: 185pWPxgG2Y1AyrgGZCnAFyV73TQcpr3ts
there are two sweeps into the blockchain wallet via scanning the private key in the mobile app.
Looking here is has total received as the correct value, but when I login and look, the received value it twice the current balance and the amount sent is same as the balance.  Basically I received my sweeps, sent out the same value (minus transaction fees) and then received back that value (minus transaction fees).

I think any business that can simplify the process of buying, storing, transferring bitcoins safely could succeed.  Right now, keeping your coins safe, is quite technologically advanced for the layperson

Right, so basically if I wanted to spend a portion of my paper wallet, I would have to send the entire contents to a web wallet (or software) use up that portion I wanted to spend, and then send the remainder back to a new paper wallet.  
Interesting, I think I understand the concept.  I will have to do some further reading more into the "why"

You're right.  I thought about that afterwards and it would never work.

One idea I heard him interviewing a guy who mentioned someone that sequenced his own DNA and then uploaded the hash of his DNA sequencing to the blockchain to prove that he existed at that exact moment in time (or something similar to that). That in of itself may or may not be that useful, but it's concept like these that lead to invention and amazing things. The concept of using the blockchain to prove inventions or scientific ideas or intellectual property is very interesting to me

Definitely let me know if you find something.  Not only would it be a great and worthwhile cause, but it could really show the power of bitcoin and the community

Thats really cool.  For the effort it appears to take to make it, and it looks like good quality, I would pay up to $100.  Can't see paying any more than that though.
One thought is you could offer vanity addresses at a premium and just regular addresses at a discount.  That way you can pre make a bunch of them to sell and only have to worry about making the vanity addresses to order

It's just replenishing what you already have. 
ex: you have 1 btc in your coinbase wallet.  you spend 0.05 btc from that wallet, coinbase will automatically buy 0.0 5btc to replace that.

What about using Coinbase instead of Gox?  I am currently looking into this and so far it would work, assuming  that the transfers of bitcoin are instant (or an hour with 6 confirmations).
that is, why can't I purchase on CampBX ($345), transfer the bitcoins to my Coinbase wallet and then sell directly into my bank account ($385)?  I haven't tested with small amounts yet though.  The only thing that would throw a kink in this, which I haven't looked into yet, would be (1) the availability to transfer your bitcoins from Campbx after you purchase them (2) the ability to sell your bitcoins at Coinbase right after they transfer in.  
Your only fee's would be the trade in campBX (0.55%) and the sell in Coinbase (1%).  As long as the btc price difference is greater then 2-3% you will come out ahead (current it is about 10-12%)
The other main issue here is getting your USD into CampBX.  Soon (nov 20th) they will have ACH bank transfer activated, which will make it much easier to transfer in USD and theoretically could increase their price of bitcoin.
