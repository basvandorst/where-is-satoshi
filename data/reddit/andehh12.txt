Send them to me with high fees, I'll then refund you the transaction fee and forward them on for free. I am totes legit. *nods convincingly*
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:05:18
Actual Coinbase or GDAX? I guess it depends on your verification, location, history and account age etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:01:23
Ah I see. Good luck then! I've not had any issues with Coinbase but I keep hearing their support team take forever to respond.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:33:34
IF it crashes... How fast are we talking? Or is that the same as asking when and by how much?
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:19:25
GDAX is Coinbase

The simple rule is don't invest (risk) money that you can't afford to lose. It could go up, it could go down. No one knows. It should be treated as a long term investment.
If you really can't afford to lose what you've put in then sell your original stake and keep the 400 profit in BTC.

You did the maths right but read the answer wrong. 0.0033 = 0.33%.

Create an account with an exchange (if you don't have one already). Transfer coins to exchange and then sell. Not sure on GBP support though, might have to do it in Euro. Alternatively you can sell privately on localbitcoins but that could be more risky.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:41:29
That makes sense. Thanks.

Their website says "Gauranteed bitcoin when needed".
You can't get a better gaurantee than that!

Try logging in on a PC and see if it works there. I had issues verifying on android but it worked eventually.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:21:57
At a guess... 9% and 4% below your asking price? That really is a guess though, I've never used the site.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:34:01
What kind of problems? Is their support helping? I have one on order but won't receive it for a few weeks
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:46:50
Transfer balance to GDAX. It's the same company, free to transfer between and they seemingly absorb the transfer fees when you withdraw.

If you had a mining application which you recently uninstalled, it's probably just a botched uninstall. Try running something like CCleaner to fix your start-up and registry.

Coinbase is very easy to use but has high fees. Try using GDAX, it's Coinbase's trading platform and has lower fees AND BETTER RATES!
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:29:28
Ethereum may be of interest to you. It's a distributed computing platform for which the usage token is traded as a virtual currency. Go do some research, it's really interesting technology.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:52:41
You'd be running at a loss. Better to put that money straight into BTC
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:36:34
Try GDAX, it's CB's trading platform and uses the same login. You can also transfer your CB funds and coins instantly and for free. It has better prices and lower fees (sometimes no fees). It's a little more complicated but you get better value.

@_date: 2017-08-30 08:29:38
Yeah you'll pay a fee though. That's how I got my money into Coinbase... SEPA transfer from GBP account to a EUR account. Had a £10 fee (from my own bank). I assume it works the same way in reverse.
I'm just having a look at Uphold, I saw someone else mention it, not that I'm looking to sell anytime soon though.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:54:53
Aren't you supposed to send them a small amount of money for them to verify? That's how it works in the UK.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:03:49
Nailed it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:52:39
Should only cost €10 for a standard transfer.

If I'd known last week's lottery numbers, that would have been nice too. If I'd known exactly when the bottom of the last dip was that would have been great. If I knew when the next dip was gonna be... Etc etc.
No point dreaming about what could have been. Just think about how you can make the most of it now and in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:43:30
This fork is very different to Bitcoin Cash. Is expected that only one chain will survive and due to the lack of replay protection, it's risky to sell/transfer either coin as you may inadvertently lose the other as well.

So why title your post "I should have HODL"?  You're contradicting yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:48:09
No it was 200k bitcoins, not $200k worth of bitcoins.
"She turned down the offer as the virtual currency was worth only a small amount at the time..."
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:37:23
But you're at risk of losing both sets of coins due to the lack of replay protection. This isn't like the BCH fork, this is a mess.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:41:07
Spending replacing is a good concept though. Helps to support the market, albeit in a tiny way.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:43:27
CEX looks like it has potential for me though. It seems to accept deposits in GBP for a start!
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:10:54
Can do with GDAX / Coinbase too but limits are low and fees are high... I'll wait until Monday... WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:17:59
But still no SegWit... :-/
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:35:38
Google it, it's an important concept.

I would have paid him in BTC and replaced it but it was prepaid AND I don't have any funds in a hot wallet.

You can transfer from Coinbase to GDAX instantly for free. I assume it works the other way too but I've never tried. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:37:23

I'm using Exodus but it's relatively new and not Open Source which some people are critical of. Ultimately, if you're holding more than you can afford to lose then a HW wallet is the best option. I have a Ledger Nano S on the way.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:34:00
It makes very little difference at this point. I've already got money arriving in GDAX on Monday. Only option in the meantime would be to pay by card, which I can do with either.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:10:11
No one has actually paid him in BTC yet though.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:25:18

GDAX shows a lot of sell orders in at 4800 and 4850, gonna take a sustained push to break through those. Don't forget the psychological milestones in other currencies too.

@_date: 2017-09-03 14:57:33
I've only started paying attention recently but I find them useful to see where the resistance and support is based on existing buy and sell orders. 
If there's a big step in the sell chart at a particular milestone then you know there will be a big sell off when the price hits it. Likewise, a big step in the buy chart shows that if the price drops to that level, a lot of buy orders will go live and hopefully bounce the price back up.
I'm sure there's much much more to be read from the charts but that's the extent of my knowledge/observations. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:41:35
Try GDAX, part of Coinbase but better rates and lower fees.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:03:20
Exodus Wallet does this.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:58:26
Yeah I agree... It's a shame they didn't stick an article about Bitcoin in there too! Would have been some good promotion!
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:41:09
I use Coinbase/GDAX, converting GBP into EUR through a SEPA transfer (at a cost of £10).
It's not ideal but there aren't any exchanges trading in GBP that I'm aware of. You can pay in GBP by card but you get hit with high fees. You could also look at localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:38:18
Wallets don't have fees. The Bitcoin network charges fees to transfer coins. Some wallets allow you to set your own fees though. Lower fees = slower transfers, higher fees = faster transfers
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:35:47
Yeah it's annoying!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:46:55
It's one of the easiest places to buy bitcoin. Great for new people getting into crypto. Hopefully most will move their coins out as they become more knowledgeable and educated.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:22:19
All I know is that crypto is treated as a foreign currency and is therefore subject to Capital Gains Tax, not Income Tax.
