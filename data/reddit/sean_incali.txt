i'm calling it.  we bust through to 14k this week. then correct and then up to 20K in the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:11:36
i was wrong. it was a pennant. it looked like it was forming a cup then it moved sideways and turned into a pennant. i was on the 1  minute chart.
look up bullish bearish chart patterns and you will get a lot more information
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:24:52
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:45:14
because we need to head to 9K
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:20:46
oops wrong chart.
here's an album. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:10:13
lol buy wall of 13010 for over 230 btc came in just now
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:41:10
i bet we're getting a cup and handle right now. and then off again to new highs
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:07:47
except the new ones they listed. i say they will continue to srtuggles
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:32:03
broke through the flag just now. like it did this morning. either this is the blow up or we go through another consolidation and a flag pattern
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:05:27
it's finding support at 12.3 on 30 m chart, it seems. this is the 10th time since the 14k, we've tested this level.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:50:59
we're already back up to 12140!
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:44:36
looks like recovery is well underway. all the RSI MACD seems poised to go up on on 1 hour, 30 and 15 min charts,
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:32:27
used price bro.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:25:14
and now of course it had to turn into resistance at 12.3
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:28:04
more and more like b rally as days go by. 
 i think this correction has more to go. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:08:14
you all need to look up damped oscillation on wiki
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:21:20
well, if they hadn't, someone else would've come along and proposed similar protocols doing similar or perhaps even better things. it just would've taken a bit longer. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:12:10
more like tools to monitor where the transactions are originating from which can be done if you're running the full node(s). 
then you have the ip location of the wallet that generated the transaction
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:50:00
not traceable, but trackable on blockchain. in order to trace them to a person or an IP, you'd need another layer of espionage tools.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:26:00
you know any ~~tie~~ time i see silly posts like this. i'm reminded of the origins of the internet. 
darpanet began as a network for spies to communicate with each others. it wasn't until the government decided to release it to the private sector that it really took off, giving the governments a communications network that cannot be turned off. 
Now that our spies have all the communications they need, what else do you think they need? they probably need money. visa? mastercard? wire? 
Who do you think wants the untraceable, unseizable, secure money? (although completely trackable and transparent)

How long does it take for an buy or sell orders to clear using coinbase? 
Also do they debit your bank account after you sell them or do they just deposit money into your account on coinbase? 
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:35:34
i say we go to 8200 this week probably tonight or tomorrow. this is the third time we're heading below 8600 or so.  this is going to break this time. all the higher times charts starting at 30 min have all topped.
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:25:14
wi tu lo
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:31:43
looks like we could actually get to 6000 this week.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:28:49
because people want to buy more at 3k
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:46:10
are you fucking retarded? 
purchasing power is what the money "has." And more circulation of money means more money supply. 


lowering purchasing power INCREASES prices
are you retarded or what?
learn some fucking economics before you start yapping about shit you know nothing about.
also stop making crypto blockchain look bad by posting shit you don't know anything about
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:49:14
are you fucking retarded? this post was about china pegging their currency to the us to manipulate the exchange rate regardless of their m3 size. 
shut the fuck up you retard. 
btw, m3 is their money size.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:43:29
are you retarded? 


increasing the supply of money will lower the price of money? 
are you fucking retarded? 
it's the retards like you who make cryptocurrency and blockchain look bad. fuck off.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:08:50
this goes to show you. this was a bear rally. usually when bear rally pops, we go back to before it began which should be 3K. 
here's to hoping. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 07:51:19
No it doesn't. it's the exchange rate that devalues the currency internationally. 
printing willy nilly devalues the currency internally within the nation's borders.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:44:09
1. define the bear rally.
2. look at the past trends in bear rallies.
3. identify the bear rally in current btc market.
go from there.
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:31:17
what china has done is different from just printing internally. they're devaluing in an international exchange market. do you even understand what that means?
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:49:14
-1. who are so unconnected to the modern finance, that they are unbanked, but still have access to computers or smart devices with internet access to get to the bitcoin network? 
they have access to the internet but they can't get a bank account? Maybe, but many of those are people who cannot be trusted with a bank account which requires pooling of a money and shared responsibility of being a part of an institution.
-2. p2p? ok yes. sort of. 
-3. this why p2p is only "sort of." it's not really decentralized because of all the asic miners that dominates the mining market and are out of average people's budget. if it is truly decentralized, mr. joe schmo-six-pack-beer-belly should get on his chinese made piece of shit laptop and mine the fucking thing. 
-4. unduplicatable? um, of course it is duplicatable. it's just a ledger stored on a network.  
as a matter of fact when you run the node on the network, you're doing exactly that. duplicating the entire ledger only to add to it another block when it's finished mining.
-5. easy? not so much. "quick, what's your bitcoin addy? i can send some pocket money to you." 
get it, now? See, who can remember your own btc addy?
anonymous yes, but every single transaction is listed on a completely immutable, completely transparent, completely trackable blockchain. 
That' the entire point of the blockchain. is that really anonymous? All CIA or NSA needs is the point of the access of the internet in order to identify you. Or any law enforcement for that matter. Or any other hackers. 
-6. well, i mean, what is an investment. an investment needs to behave in a certain way to protect what you have and hopefully make it grow over time. divesting and diversifying helps you accomplish that goal.  
bitcoin dropped 9% last night. it dropped 20% in the last 2 weeks. This is not an investment, it's a speculative asset, which is fine for traders. 
-7. nah. you can't wear bitcoin jewelry, nor have cultures from all over the world revered it for it's unchanging shiny goldy color. 
besides, why do people keep saying it's as good as gold. have you tried lugging a lb of gold in your pocket everywhere? 
--- 
bitcoin should have been a proof of concept coin. 
it cannot serve as a true medium of an exchange. it's too slow, too expensive, too costly in terms of electricity to mine, and it's too easy for the government entities or the likes to track. 
and that's terrifying as it is, but wait until you see what china wants to do with a completely transparent, immutable, trackable record of every single transaction that have ever occurred with a medium of an exchange. 
bitcoin needs to go to 0. but that doesn't mean we can't trade it while goes down. i'm on trading it.
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:08:49
ok you're fucking retarded. you can't even understand what you're saying.
no wonder you post shit like this. herp derp fed bad. herp derp inflation bad.

pay for the attorney and maybe reduce the tax penalties. 
if you can't do so, unless you hired the attorney on contingency basis, you would now have to pay for the attorney, tax, tax penalties, and maybe alcohol and drugs. 
most likely alcohol and drugs either way.

default wallet will not import the old wallet without the password.
i guess the other wallets might be worth the try if they can show the balance. that gives me some incentives moving forward. thank you
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:04:44
Ok This worked. Thank you. 
Why is it syncing all that data? 
unfortunately, i remember the the reason i abandon the mining. lol i had 0 bitcoins. hahaha
I could've sworn i had a few ubtc's in there that i got from joining the pools etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:33:25
i'll give it a try. thank you
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:23:23
this is kind of old thread, but there is a fee of a sort in the form of collars. 1% for buys and 5% for the sells. 
so if you buy 100 bucks worth of btc at the market price thinking you will pay 100 bucks, you might end up paying 101 bucks. 
or if you sell 100 bucks worth of btc at the market price thinking you will get 100 bucks, but you might end up getting 95 bucks. 
why such high collar for the sells? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:12:24


what does downloading the entire blockchain do? does it not require the password? 


I have the default bitcoin wallet from bitcoin.org. Do these other wallet do something different from the default wallet? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:37:00
i'll give it a try. thank you

my point is that bitcoin is going to zero unless it can solve its problems. and it can't
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:32:02
so I have to let the sync go all the way to 130 some gigs before i can see those ubtc i've got? 
there has to be a better way, no?

And likely, they will ban trading it as well as soon as they find out their masses are sending unknown amount of money overseas using bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:04:02
It's not the daily activities using the bitcoins the CCP will want to ban. Yuan/Bitcoin exchange mechanism allows the Chinese masses to get money out of their country unaffected by their foreign exchange limits of $50K (I believe).
There are only two things that will happen here. The CCP continues to allow bitcoin/Yuan exchange, which accelerates the capital flight from their country, or the CCP will ban them entirely, which appears to be happening now.
