Would you really trust your employees with the ability to irreversibly send funds from an account?

Oh well if it's profitable it can't be a bad thing.


Considering we're a long way from 100% renewable energy it doesn't really make a difference if individual mining operations use solar power, if the miners weren't using it then other consumers would, likely in the place of less environmentally friendly sources
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:15:34


Which is intentional, it encourages people to invest rather than having all that money sitting stagnant. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:04:52
Question for the day. If the Euro is likely to drop in value, why would anyone sell their presumably valuable bitcoin for them. And if it's going to remain stable why bother with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:15:10
Again, still a pretty small subset of use cases. Plus like you mentioned, the volatility. Not to mention the insanity of putting what little money you have into a currency you probably haven't had time to fully understand and deal with securely 
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:04:34
That's a pretty limited use, especially since one of the big concerns many Greeks have is not having enough money for their immediate needs, nevermind sending what they do have out of the country 
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:14:16
The purchasing power of the average person is far greater than I was back then. Not to mention, at $10 a day it would take 28 years to pay off that house, that's assuming you put 100% of your income towards it at 0% interest.
Inflation actually makes long term deals like that a lot easier on the average person
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:15:28
The number of "I lost all my coins" posts on here is pretty good proof of this. If people who go out of their way to use bitcoin can't manage it securely what hope does the average person have?
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:37:57
Still leaves the question, if bitcoins are so useful to people inside Greece, why would anyone trade them away for Euros 
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:43:25
Even if you have no money it's a good idea. Any half decent idea should be able to easily stand up to whatever scrutiny you could muster in the spur of the moment
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:33:58
OK, but don't act surprised if they become less precious when no one uses them
@_date: 2015-06-14 04:04:22
I'm thinking along the lines of bitcoin existing at or below say $50 a coin with minimal merchant adoption. Seeing as it dying of completely is pretty unlikely.
Could make a wager in the form of something tangible. Perhaps a bottle of rather fine scotch?
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:46:35
Bingo, if the best argument you can raise against someone is that you think they're a shill then maybe they actually have a point regardless of if they're being paid or not
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:55:28
It's hardly surprising, people here think they deserve to be rich because they bought some internet tokens that will become more valuable somehow.

You realise they've mostly been using yen, USD and AUD since 2009 right? Why would they reinvent the wheel?
@_date: 2015-06-14 03:55:46
What are you offering them to justify that?
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:19:21
Serious question, what percentage of your monthly expenses are paid using services that pay in USD on your behalf
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:19:46
Drunken math, misplaced a zero somewhere.
Inflation isn't the issue though, wages are. In places where pay keeps pace with inflation it benefits people a great deal.
Not to mention a deflationary currency would make borrowing money even harder since the interest rate would have to exceed the rate the money would appreciate naturally as well as making a profit. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:18:32
Bingo, there are so many other assets they could put there money in that are far more stable, practical and already understood by the average person.

Question though, why would Amazon do any of that? Is there a vast untapped market of people with only bitcoins who want things from Amazon? And why would thyey give them a discount for paying like that?

You don't think companies would just cut wages in a deflationary system? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 03:55:01
I'd be willing to wager you that the USD will outlive bitcoin

@_date: 2015-06-25 12:42:34
I'm a little skeptical of this, I'm fairly tech savvy and I've turned down being paid in bitcoin the two times it was offered. Nothing about it was convenient, especially compared to payment methods I already had
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:04:25
Or just save the $20, that way the good feeling can't be wiped out by another price crash 
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:52:04
Not to mention people who already have money can buy technology and experts to operate it for them
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:46:35
Well, primarily yeah. Entire nations do just fine with them, they function identically to currency they already understand and the price is pretty stable.

Compared to using regular money in a bank account this is a pretty annoying method. Personally the tiny fees I pay on a bank account are far better value than the time it would take to secure bitcoins and the risk involved. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:45:37
This is bad for bitcoin.....
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:59:13

@_date: 2015-01-06 20:57:26
Yeah I wish people would stop trying to make that claim, the internet provided so many things that were unheard of at the time. Bitcoin isn't all that different from what we already had, in fact some could argue it is noticeably worse in many ways

It isn't the first, in fact considering it requires a smart phone and internet connection it's not even a valid option for a lot of people.

@_date: 2017-04-20 21:05:13
Yeah good luck getting that to happen.if the country is unstable enough that they need a new currency then there is no way people are going to trust some bizarre internet currency they've never heard of that was printed in a government facility.

And I already sold up, made a tidy profit but I don't think it's a good investment
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:04:56
Sure but there's every corner that bitcoin won't be the basis of it. Same way the modern phone networks don't really resemble the works of Edison

Otherwise casinos would basically be the salty spittoon

Why would they? Currency is far more useful to a business 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:54:51
Also worth considering that people faulting ideas were rightly critical of the iteration of them at the time.
Bitcoin as it is has some serious flaws, the concept of a crypto currency however may have real potential
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:12:17
Probably doesn't help that half this sub was jacking off to the idea of it going up another few K and the moon being within reach. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:47:52
Really depends if you include transactions they initiate or just the ones they process.
Also worth considering many large data centres invest heavily in offsetting their usage with solar and other renewables, do you intend to count that usage towards their total seeing as the capacity would not exist to be used elsewhere if not for the bank
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:47:32
Only if they bring a profit, why would you lower your prices when you could just as easily sell with the same currency everyone already uses and requires no extra work to handle

No, I'm asking if you have any evidence that anyone specific here has been proven to be receiving financial compensation for mocking bitcoin.
And surely you see how foolish you look and how someone like me could find this amusing and a little interesting 
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:38:36
Hedging against inflation is trivial to do though, not to mention if you're going to get into an argument over stability bitcoin isn't exactly a great counterpoint 
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:07:05

@_date: 2015-04-23 02:46:07

@_date: 2015-04-23 02:17:21
Really? My average has been around 9.8%, though even 3.3% would at least hold even with inflation too

People without savings don't really lose anything to inflation though
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:38:32
Because maybe if you dislike something you shouldn't join in.
And your argument relies on the idea that inflation is a negative. Something most economists would vehemently disagree with. 
Not to mention it doesnt even have to be a cryptocurrency that succeeds, could just be a system using traditional money
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:56:36
And seeing as it requires money to get bitcoins
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:33:05
Seems the problem is more with American retirement savings than with inflation, or at the very least the former would be the easier one to change for the same result

Why wouldn't it be? The same rules and consequences would apply as they do now

@_date: 2015-04-23 01:34:50
Which conflicts pretty considerably with the inflation = theft sentiment expressed by many bitcoin proponents.
I'm not saying its impossible for it to succeed. Just seems to me that the idea of bitcoin is being shoehorned into everything regardless of its suitability 
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:03:21
There might be, but the same money could be made with a killer app for the USD
@_date: 2015-04-05 04:30:37
That assumes that both the fees are actually 3%, not the .5-1% I've seen, plus also that there would be enough transactions to make the effort worthwhile. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:11:29

If you ever want to succeed with this you can't just wave your hand and say oh it will get fixed somehow in the future
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:45:40
And you don't think anything else could maybe do better in 125 years? It's pretty debatable as to whether or not bitcoin is better than anything we even have now.
Also, if you want to have a serious discussion don't down vote anyone who replies, its just petty
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:11:29
Not to mention opening a dispute won't being anyone back to life or fix a problem that was left untreated for too long

Plus corporations tend to have a lot more recourses and can make arrangements with banks
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:21:58

@_date: 2015-03-08 22:48:54


I think a few people here would disagree with you :p
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:39:43
I read that post yesterday, if I had printed it out I wouldn't even wipe my ass with it
@_date: 2015-11-02 04:29:56

@_date: 2015-03-27 02:50:38

Or you know, into something perfectly stable and consistent. 
Money is a medium of exchange, maybe you would like it to be an eternally consistent store of value, but it isn't.
Under the current system you can effectively store your money in your mattress by investing it in a medium hedged against inflation, but with the added benefit of providing capital to other parties at the same time. Same end result for you, so why should we replace that with your system?
