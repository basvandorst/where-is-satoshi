I've "been on an exchange" inasmuch as I made my original purchases on Coinbase.
But I never sold them on exchanges. I just used them like currency, which I assumed (up until now) that was how it was treated ...

Ok. I hope I wasn't near $20k (certainly not in selling BTC for USD) but I did make some random purchases on online websites with my BTC.
I guess I'll follow the advice here ... file an extension and figure out what to do.

Geez. $600 isn't a lot at all, and I don't really have the records from my wallets (some lost, otherwise just not very good record keeping of every $15 purchase from my local btc-friendly businesses).
I have more questions than I can ask at this point about this stuff. I don't think I ever went over the $20k limit on the exchanges. But it's really tough to track down every random wallet I might have used over the past years, convert that back to the original purchase price, and then figure out what I might owe. I doubt many tax accountants are very experienced in this - what are all the random occasional BTC users going to do who just bought some to use as currency every once in a while?
Just seems insane to me. It'll likely cost me more in time and tax professionals to figure out what I might owe than it was ever worth to mess with BTC in the first place.
I'm seriously expected to trace down every wallet I've ever used, figure out the difference between my purchase price in BTC and the $25 I spent buying (e.g., vape juice), and pay taxes on whatever the difference is?
I mean I understand it for taxing the newly-found BTC millionaires and all that, but for your average joe this has the potential to seriously fuck them over some minuscule amount of tax I didn't even know was relevant until very recently.
