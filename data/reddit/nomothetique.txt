You are fucking stupid.

It is because bitcoin threatens the statist quo. The attitude shift by most of HN or mainstream investors really is just happening in the past year or so from what I see.

Bitcoin comes up regularly on Hacker News, which has way more street cred regarding tech than @_date: 2014-04-14 17:11:54
I don't know if you are a newbie or not, but I am just saying it is a perrenial thing to bitch about the quality of HN going down for this, that or the other reason. Would you say that HN or has, comparatively, more credibility?
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:56:17


lol no... I think part of their rules are about newbs complaining about HN becoming like reddit or something.

There's quite a lot written on this. I'd point you to *The Myth of National Defense* for one: [link](
I'd like to see politicians and corporate criminals held to account and we'd need some sort of force to see that through. A for-profit military is quite possible too. I'm not sure how else to answer your question.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:54:56
And bitcoin is not technology? My word, people on reddit say the stupidest things.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:54:27
Yup, I only read the comment before yours, went back to look and thought the same. And, I will add that it is poor grammar to start sentences with a conjunction, Apple, seriously.

That seems pretty dubious that windows phone is more popular than bitcoin and anyhow the main reason given ITT as well as your arguments here are bullshit.

I still have my email from 2011 when they got hacked and released my email and password. I have been like wow that people have kept using them this long.

Clearly bitcoin is more than just a mathematical curiosity. Your atypical definition of tech is interesting because I take it the other direction and consider even such things as ideology broadly a "technology". You probably aren't interested in this but libertarians might want to read [here](
is not applying your standard regarding what tech is. "Windows Phone 8.1 review" on the front page right now, just as one example.

What if someone forms a state? I think we should just have states. Hopefully the problem with this logic is obvious.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:03:10
Yes, I was talking more about some recent conversations with other anarchist libertarians who were also bitcoin true believers. I got shouted down for explaining this because of "centralization".
The sharing economy is subverting a lot of stupid laws like zoning, hotel and taxi licensing, etc. Talking about "censorship" usually implies speech to me but yeah, suppression of the free expression which goes along with voluntary exchange.

This isn't an analog/digital debate because you can have reasonably secure digital representations of milligrams of gold or whatever just like bitcoins.


Only because we are also in the age of state &amp; democracy worship and these criminal institutions have a habit of destroying anything that threatens their counterfeiting scheme (central banking).
Being decentralized isn't really much of a selling point for bitcoin once statism is abolished. It only is if you don't trust the security of a bank which attempts to hold gold and issue currency. Of course, this is the situation now so bitcoin has utility, but I am just sick of people who have been drinking a little too much of the bitcoin kool-aid and think it will be superior forever.
How I think something like bitcoin might continue to exist once we have a free society is related to some ideas which are getting popular now like "the sharing economy". Bitcoin is interesting because of its function as a public ledger. There was something on github I saw a while back about a protocol for real-world property but I forget what it was called now, anyone know?

Your video doesn't load, so if you have a point make it. Gold might have some edge but you can use other precious metals, oil, whatever chemicals go into the room-temp superconductors or whatever, a commodity.


What is "industrial use"? One thing that matters when you ask, "What is money?" is that the thing in question has utility (not "value"). This just means people want it enough that it is meaningful.


Who said anything about God? Arguments like that are horrible and show the weakness of your position. Like I said, we're going to have to agree to disagree because stuff like that is wasting my time and I am going to just stop responding. All of these commodities have use... The superior ones will tend to be used as money. Maybe oil or grain is inferior because of its bulkiness, but we have other options and could fall back on these if needed (plus using digital representations counteracts this problem).


Fiat (paper) currencies are supposedly "based on trust". Looking at it for what it is, we can see it is truly "backed" by force and fear of the government's monopoly.
History will show you that when money was precious metals, these had appeal or utility besides just as currency. A lot of your questions can be answered by this book if you really want to learn about this: 
Fiat money and central banking is a relatively new practice in the timeline of human history. There was government intervention with central minting, diluting metal composition and so on, but near zero utility like pieces of colored paper (or bitcoin-esques 1's and 0's) is new.


Maybe, but I don't really understand how colored coins work yet. A blurb on BitcoinX says in part:


So, maybe that is fine, but then you aren't referencing the total amount of 21 million outstanding bitcoins relative to value and you are using a digital currency which references a commodity with actual utility, which is exactly what I have been saying will come about post-statism.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:55:03
Oh, I forgot about colored coins and sort of heard about that recently, but this was something else I saw that came out about a year ago. It was a whole separate protocol, not just tacking on metadata to bitcoins (not sure I understand colored coins correctly though).
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:36:34
The video stutters and dies. This line of "only gold" is nonsense. We're dealing with the very real possibility of using digital representations of the commodity for transactions, so silver works fine because it can just be stored usually in an environment where it won't tarnish. Oil works fine because you don't need to make it into portable coins. All sorts of things could work and there are millions of chemical compounds besides elements... Use your imagination, I don't know exactly what future people will do, simply that what I am saying about economic theory is correct.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:58:15


You don't seem to get it. You can send bits of data which represent gold just as quickly as bitcoin transactions. Actually faster because it wouldn't require the whole blockchain/network thing bitcoin has.


I'm not obsessed with gold. Money can be any commodity but it needs some utility. Bitcoin only has utility because of the existence of states and the need to evade the type of confiscatory policies which always ruin "e-gold".
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:12:25


Who said anything about "industrial"? I don't see why you are fixated on gold when I have clearly said that money can be any commodity.
How much utility do all of the other sequences of 1's and 0's on your computer have right now isolated from how they interact from bitcoin or your other programs? Zero.
Look, I am a big supporter of bitcoin and early adopter too, but if you don't get what I am saying here then I am just going to have to say we'll agree to disagree. I'm talking about the distant future. I'd be happy to live long enough to see the day where statism is abolished and I can make out on shorting bitcoin as better currencies come about ;)

[Is this you OP?](
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:22:18
In a legal order where we've abolished these states that go after gold-backed currencies, I think gold (perhaps with a digital representation) is superior to bitcoin. I didn't watch the video because it was annoying and don't really know what the point was. Still, I have been bewildered by some bitcoin proponents who think that in a free society (anarcho-capitalist) that bitcoin would continue to thrive and real commodity backed monies wouldn't come about again.
Bitcoin *only* has utility because of the existence of governments which stamp out competing currencies.
