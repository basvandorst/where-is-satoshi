Actually, most of the core group of Bitcoiners I know that have been around since 2011 have quit mining.  We've been outpriced by a new wave of people buying incredibly inflated Asic hardware.  Most of us had small GPU farms, but GPU is no longer possible, of course.
I'd love to raise money and offer the type of business you describe, but if I'm in the U.S. and my government is just waiting to throw some poor geek like me in jail for opening up a business like GHash's Cex.io here.  The SEC commissioner has said so, in so many words.

If we're the minority here, we are the top voted comments all in line with the OP's message?  Maybe, just maybe, we're actually the majority here.

Serious question: are you getting paid to post pro Ghash posts?  You're posting *nothing* but comments defending or excusing GHash, at a rate of one per 10 minutes or so.
Seriously, *nothing* but Ghash comments.

This is kind of like Ripple's consensus mechanism, except it's more robust than what you're describing.
Ripple is really a brilliant system, notwithstanding the massive fuck-up that is OpenCoin and their decision to create a new currency and allocate it all to themselves (and then squabble over it).

I see this situation as much different than Deepbit or earlier pools.  GHash is clearly not part of the community; they don't give a shit about Bitcoin or decentralization.  Also, they keep breaking promises.
Deepbit made a promise that they kept to keep the hashrate well below 50%.
No, this is pretty clearly Bitcoin's first existential threat.  It'll be interesting to see what happens.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:06:13
No facts?  Do you not realize that it *is* a mathematical fact that GHash controls protocol changes now, or is close to it?
And I can only hope that newbies will latch on.  That'd be a good thing.
But I'm through talking with you now.  I don't see anything productive coming out of our discussion at this point.  Fucking "screeching".

Bitcoin has nothing to do with layer 3, much less layer 2.    The Bitcoin protocol is at layer 7.  It runs *on top of* layer 4 -- TCP.
So there's only one protocol layer to update with Bitcoin, and that's the Bitcoin network protocol, at layer 7 (the application layer) if you must specify a "layer".
But in my experience, software developers  don't usually speak in terms of all these layers.  The OSI model is just a model, after all, and most developers prefer to just talk about what network protocols a new protocol runs on top off.  
For development purposes, that's usually enough.

I was specifically referring to earlier pools, specifically Slush.  But yeah, Deepbit later reached ~30% and there was an outcry.
Even if I was off by 10%, does it affect my point?

Yes, two:
1.  Andrew Miller's non-outsourceable puzzles:
2.  To a certain extent, Peter Todd's tree chains:
The first requires a hard fork.  Tree chains may not.
There may be other solutions, but those are the two I'm aware of.

I agree that oleganza is doing some really interesting work, and is also very good at writing about it.  He also has his heart in the right place re: network decentralization.

Yes, but DDOS is often done in conjunction with an actual hack as a means to distract the sysops.

What you want to bet?  How much?  Let's find a reliable escrow and settle it.  How about johnthedong?  Would a 2011 Bitcointalk account convince you?  Multiple Bitcoin-related Github projects?  Code in the core repo?

And you have to be willing to inform on your customers, even ones you suspect are innocent of any wrongdoing.  Discretion is not allowed.

I'm really sad that you, someone who has consistently been fighting for decentralized solutions and freedom from government and other central forces, doesn't take this seriously.  What is it that blinds you and Gavin?
If we're going to let a single company control the protocol, why not just let them run servers and be done with it?  Because don't fool yourself, GHash is in control of almost everything now.  *They* can add protocol changes with no discussion in addition to all the 51% attack fun. 
I don't get it.  
And by the way, I've totally lost faith in Gavin's "leadership" role.  So his statement means absolutely nothing to me.
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:24:33
Wow, counterparty a "pump and dump"?  Really?  I don't know much about Mastercoin, but I've followed counterparty for a while and they're actually one of the few new coins who is truly innovating.   The Bitcoin community was longing for a decentralized marketplace on top of Bitcoin, and they were the first to provide one.
What's more, they're one of the few coins that didn't enrich the founders, since there was no premine whatsoever.  Everyone who wanted XCP, devs included, had to buy them through the Bitcoin "burn-in".  That actually took a lot of flak for that since supporters said they didn't make enough money to support the project.
I can respect people who honestly oppose using the Blockchain for non-Bitcoin transactions.  But anyone who calls it a "pump and dump" is either not familiar with the project or has some ulterior motive.  Because it's just not true.
So I don't know about the rest of your accusations.  But based on what I know for sure about Counterparty, I'm pretty skeptical.   The whole thing reads more like a hit piece than a legitimate complaint.

Who the fuck are you to question me?
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:02:29
Decentralization, along with security, are really the two sine qua nons of Bitcoin.  We cannot afford to compromise on either of these goals.
Knowing what you do about Bitcoin's origins and Satoshi's intentions, I'd be very worried if you feel any other way.
So Gavin, I want to clarify: do you believe Bitcoin's decentralization is a negotiable?  Do you *not* believe decentralization should be maintained at any and all costs, short of decreasing security?

Wrong!  Petamine is mining on GHash.  Unless and until they actually move to another pool, they should also be boycotted.
Nice comment otherwise.
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:50:15


Well, *who* did you ask?  Go back and see how long they had been around.  They probably had only been mining a few months themselves.
Also, it's pretty clear that miner interests and core Bitcoiner interests have diverged since the onset of Asic mining.


What?  There has been a similar outcry like this about GHash *twice* already, back last fall and in January?  Did you not see the satirical "Bitcoin cycle"?  It was satire for a reason.

They are owned by the same company.  Same entity.  Same owners.

I saw bdarmstrong by the title and thought, "isn't that one of the Coinbase founders?".  Indeed it is.  Great idea.  Do it please.
I think the best thing you could provide other than no fee is to smooth out the variance.  I know that would cause you all to take a small hit (you'd essentially be loaning Bitcoins interest-free) but the goodwill and marketing it would generate would probably offset it.

And Mint accepts Bitcoin.
Plus, with Mint, you can install Mate, which gives you the old Gnome 2 desktop environment many of us loved.
And Mint appears to be the most popular distro at this time.

Holy mother of God, how many posts defending GHash are you going to make?  
Are you getting paid per post?
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:12:36


Oh dear god, that makes me sick to hear.  I mean, if you absolutely *must* you client-side JavaScript for this kind of thing, you should know that there are cryptographically secure random number generators available on Chrome and Firefox via window.crypto.getRandomValues() and IE as of IE11 via window.mscrypto.getRandomValues()  You can to pass in a typed array to receive the random bytes, but it's pretty straightforward.
But somehow, I suspect that brainwallet knows that there are better sources of client-side entropy available.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:38:12


Yeah, we'll see about that.  See:
Hard fork, baby.  It's coming.  Readiness for change is building.
You want to keep antagonizing us?  Go for it.
