Make bitcoin great again

Would you recommend any sites like the ones you talked about?
@_date: 2012-12-15 12:59:06
Look at all these greedy people... *cough*
@_date: 2012-12-09 18:58:18
I have, but I don't entirely understand what it encompasses.  It's creating private keys that people can use?  I'm not really sure the purpose of the outcome.  (Also, I have no idea how to do it :P)

~~Ah yes, I was reading this earlier, it seems to not start up when I run the miner.  I was going to post in the forums when I look into it more. Thanks for the link though!~~
**Edit:** No, I'm just a dumbass, got it working, just have no idea how to use it.
**Edit 2:** I seem to have it working, but I have no idea how I'll get paid once the private key generates.

There is nothing wrong with buying them, I was just asking about alternatives to buying for new users.
Again, nothing wrong with buying, I will buy some coins at some point to trade, I just wanted to make my own endeavors succeed a bit.

Thanks for the links mate. I'll see what I can find on my own as well.

What would you recommend for NA?
@_date: 2012-12-10 02:24:40
Currently don't have to pay for electricity (College) and I run 2 gtx 480s

Thank you! I was looking for something like this, an alternative to mining and buying.  Thank you again!
@_date: 2012-12-09 20:30:07
I'm just curious to see what other means exist outside of mining and buying, so if you wouldn't mind, I would love to see the sites!

I finally had money during a dip so I decided to purchase after buying at 300 and selling at 600. I will forever kick myself in the ass for that, but now we HODL

I didn't know the conversion rate on Good Boy Points was so high.  Better go turn some of mine in.

I meant my personal wallet on my PC, but I understand what you're saying though.
Thank you for your help, it's been most informative :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:55:49
Thank you for responding so quickly!
I had an inkling that's how they functioned.  So whenever I find a point where I want to withdraw my funds, I can just shoot it over to my local BTC-wallet, correct?
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:24:44
No, I believe they asked you a question.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:03:48
He asked what the differences were, not for a single record that doesnt tell him whats different but instead "just that it is". This has nothing to do with observation and was a low effort reply not fitting for this sub.

Here I am kicking myself in the ass because I didn't buy up coins back when they were 10 
@_date: 2013-02-19 15:08:26
Want to buy bitcoins, price way too high to invest :C
