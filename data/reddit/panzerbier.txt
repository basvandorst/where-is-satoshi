Yeah. For now. Wanna bet how quickly this'll spread to other banks and existing customers now that the precedent's been set?

So because BTC is in a bear market (but otherwise still up more than double since the beginning of the year) it is now officially a popped bubble? Right-o.

Services specializing in the safe holding of bitcoin. Just like how you can store your gold in vaults.
Storing your BTC in a vault run by someone else doesn't undermine the fundamental value proposition of BTC (the 21m hard upper cap), as long as the service doesn't start fractional reserve banking.

Like the article says, Hungary and Serbia are also stocking up. These countries were royally screwed when the exchange rate between their fiats and Swiss Francs/Euros exploded in 2008, because their populace held large amounts of debt denominated in these currencies, which of course also ballooned in size. 
Nice to see they're anchoring their currencies in hard money instead of relying on equally worthless hoards of other fiat.
inb4 "USD/EUR is not worthless hurr durr": not right now they aren't. but care to bet what happens to them once the current money printing bubble blows?
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:28:56
Well, I don't know. All I do know is that there's a fair chance that fiat money will implode in a crisis of such proportions that 2008 will look like a minor inconvenience, and Bitcoin looks promising as an alternative. Nobody knows, nobody guarantees, at this point all we can do is diversify while there's still time. Whether you choose to hold Bitcoin or not is entirely up to you.

We always had a system of negative interest rates, also known as inflation. Only it was cleverly hidden and not visible on the nominal value of our accounts. The veil is now disappearing. Wonder how the average Joes will react when they finally realize just how shafted they've been all along.

Hell, I never thought about the word "feed" in this light. Thanks.


And that's why it caused such massive triggering. The truth hurts.

That's right. In most European countries there's a national pension fund that's managed centrally. They're paid from the employee's paycheck just like in the US. But they're not individualized: everyone's contributions go into the same pot and every payment comes from the same pot, there are no individual accounts, and you also cannot manage the investments, it's done by the state.
I can't decide whether this is a better or a worse system than the U.S. one. For savvy people it certainly sucks because they can't make their own investment decisions. But for the vast majority of the population (i.e. total financial illiterates) it's much better than they could do on their own.

Yes. Sorry for bad Engrish. :)

once this mother asked me for career advice for her son. She told me the son is really great with computers so they're thinking about a software dev career. Turns out what the son is really great with is Facebook, Instagram, and toggling the wifi. I recommended another career path...
Young people grew up with smartphones. Doesn't make them engineers; not even power users. Just like how watching soccer won't make you a kickass gatekeeper.

We need to push Lightning. It has to be ready by the time the next crisis hits the fan, and it's not far off. 1-2 years, tops. I can feel it.

From the outside looking in, it feels like you have nothing to lose - do you think we can expect a massive uprising to overthrow the regime? How can they possibly control you when living standards have gotten this low?

You got stuff seriously mixed up.
Cultism = fanatically following a single leader, to the exclusion of everything else in your life, gradually losing your friends and family.
Idealism = believing in, supporting, and discussing a cool idea.
Idealism is perfectly healthy. If not for idealists believing in stuff like separation of church and state, democracy, or rule of law, we would still be serfs.
I'm all for the separation of money and state. And I still live a full, normal life. That makes me an idealist, not a cultist, and there's nothing remotely problematic about that.

DCA, and store only a few % net worth in BTC. With these two, a 80% correction will be unpleasant, but not panic-inducing. When it subsequently rises to 3x of where it has corrected 80% down from it'll be a veritable joyride.
@_date: 2019-10-01 11:09:17
Yes. (I'm also using Coinbase Pro.)
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:33:33
I DCA and don't give a damn about current price. If it goes to the moon, purchasing at 8K, 9K, 10K will just be a rounding error. If it goes to zero, well, I only invest money that I can lose. Tell your friends to do the same. DCA, with money they can live without, and hodl. We'll talk again in 5 years to see whether it was worth it. :)

Not your keys, not your crypto, friend.
The main difference between a traditional bank and an exchange is that fiat transactions are reversible. Say Bull Bank is penetrated and hackers make off with a billion dollars. That transaction can be reversed at the wave of a hand. Whereas if your coin is stolen, it's gone for good; the blockchain's code doesn't care and cannot be reasoned with. The exchange has no way to retrieve your stuff and if it was a big hack they won't be able to replace it either, as they're bankrupt now.
Don't be that guy. Buy a hardware wallet and sleep easy.

Second this. This work is not just about Bitcoin, too. It contains a history of money from ancient times to today, discusses what money is, how the technology used for money affects society and so on. It is a fascinating and illuminating read.
@_date: 2019-12-22 11:32:24
Same. I live in the EU.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:44:32
Yes, unlike the previous 300 or so times its death was proclaimed in various news articles, Bitcoin really will die now!

Lol this needs to go higher

The Fed could hold a special day every year where instead of giving the money they pull out of their asses to their banker friends, they'd distribute it to the population. Just one. On the other 364 days, they could go on stealing our collective wealth through inflation.
@_date: 2019-09-18 10:05:25
It's illegal to YOU. Because you and me, we're just serf nobodies. The people of the Fed, though, they are better than us. More beautiful. They even smell a bit like roses. So THEY can do it. Get it now?

You're right, we are all just mindless sheep. Hang on to your fiat, the government will take the best possible care of you! Now move along, citizens, nothing to see here.

Originally I started investing in BTC just to get a thrill but the more I read about it (specifically, guaranteed high stock-to-flow) the more I became convinced that BTC will be a major safe haven asset when the current everything-bubble pops. I wouldn't go all-in on it, because it also has a fair chance of going to 0, but I see it as a very smart investment.
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:43:32
I seriously gave some thought to that article but it just doesn't fit. 
There's no infallible, charismatic leader to Bitcoin - nobody has heard from Nakamoto for 8 years.
There are no constraints - you can buy and sell whenever you please and nobody will ask you a thing. 
There is no doctrine - there are as many opinions on the purpose and future of Bitcoin as there are hodlers. Is it a store of value? A medium of exchange? A speculative bubble that keeps re-inflating? The hardest money ever invented?
It is just an interesting thing that hasn't existed before, and it strikes the fancy of some people, who then decide to play with it and discuss it with others. Nothing cultish about it.

Careful with exchanges, though, not all exchanges support sending out to Native Segwit yet. Look it up before you withdraw, don't lose them sats.

OR maybe read the comment carefully and decide whether it really merits "letting it sink in" and if it does, upvote it as a way to thank OP for making a well-considered and valuable statement. Knee-jerk reactions are seldom good.
