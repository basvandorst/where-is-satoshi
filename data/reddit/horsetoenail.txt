Even if Bu happens,Bitcoin wont "be a different currency run by a centralized group of people, possibly on a different chain".It will still be the same,ownership does not transfer over when the chain splits. It will still be the same while BU splits off, becoming a new currency, with new rules, and it will have as multiple exchanges have stated in a Hard Fork contingency plan, its own separate exchange marker(BU).

No, because as the the supply dwindles the prices should increase respectively.  So even though mining rewards are giving miners 6 BTC compared to the 12 it used to give, that 6 would be worth the same or more.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:24:56
Bitcoin will be secure as long as miners are running. Even after all bitcoins are mined, miners will continue to run because they'll make profit from transaction tax fees

you aren't really saying goodbye to profits if you're holding out for bigger ones.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:53:53
The way it currently works is that when a block is mined, the miner gets the block reward (12.5 BTC) + all the tx fees added up inside the block as well.

I remember trading on Mtgox in 2013. Bitcoin was just pushing for $1000, they had just announced 0% trade fees on Mtgox for the weekend, and I was looking at ClarkMoody charts and trading all day long. I decided to withdraw early December and then Mtgox shit the bed a couple months later.

I agree that there will be more crashes, I just feel like we've hit a floor in terms of all time lows, and all the people who hold onto their coins because they believe in bitcoin and want it to succeed is the reason the price will stay well above $3000.
Either that or everyone's holding out so they can see some dick eating action at the end of 2020, which in that case you should BUY BUY BUY.
Regardless of it all, i wish you good luck in trading.

idk, in my opinion its not really sky rocketing. Ever since it hit $100 it has been steadily rising and there may have been fluctuations and high volatility which brought the price up to $145, but it quickly came back down. I expect it to be up to $145+ by the 8th of April, but this is purely my speculation everyone has their own opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:27:26
The only way I see this working is if somehow these stripped down GPUs out perform an ASIC.but even just basing it off the lowest tier ASIC which still outperforms the best GPU's today, AMD and Nvidia are going to have to pull off some kind of miracle. Im eager to see what they do though.

This is why i stopped using exchanges for the time being. Almost every major exchange has been attacked via DDos or has been compromised in the past. The market price hasn't stabilized since the crash and it wont until new exchanges with stronger security and a better system for buying and selling that would counteract bots and people looking to exploit the market.

From what I think I know, as the difficulty of mining goes up, ASIC miners are slowly being but back in the same position that CPU users, and now GPU users are being put into where they are becoming obsolete. This may not happen for a couple years, but eventually it will, and at that point a rise of new more powerful ASIC miners will come into market. While new ASICs come out the price of old ones will go down making them just as affordable as GPUs when they were being used for mining.

In my opinion ( and this is strictly theory) Bitcoin will crash soon, but, it is in a re occurring cycle where it crashes and then comes back 2x stronger. My guess is next time we see a price increase its going straight for $100

honestly IMO, Id wait for the next generation of ASIC's to come out to hop on the money train because by the time BFL,Avalon, or any other ASIC manufacturer ships out their product ill be too old, HL3 still wouldn't have released, and the resources of the world would have run out 3x over.
