Just to clarify:
What makes him a moron is not that he knows nothing about the tech. Plenty of people don't know about this stuff and that's fine.
What makes him a moron is that he doesn't understand the tech and assumes that a vague description someone gave him makes him qualified to design regulation around it. The guy probably calls his operating system "Microsoft" and can't diagnose a dropped WiFi connection and yet presumes to think he can understand this when the descriptions about the tech involve so many concepts he's never even heard of.
That's what makes him a moron and I think we should try to be clear on that.

You can't have it both ways. You want to throw out opinions without being told your opinion is stupid but you're defending your right to throw out those stupid opinions.
The only point I'm trying to make is that saying people are "fucking up" when they're working for free is extremely counter productive. That doesn't seem like it would be a difficult concept to grasp or something that a person would argue with but here we are. If you want to provide meaningful feedback you can do that by writing code. Otherwise you're just some obnoxious entitled whiner.
But yes, ultimately nobody can stop you from being an obnoxious entitled whiner. I just wanted to make sure you knew that you are, in pure fact, an obnoxious entitled whiner.

And those managers to theirs all the way up the chain. Who knows what could happen.

Yeah it's too bad. I tried to express the sentiment above to him back when he would comment in this sub pretty regularly. If I ever got the chance to sit down with him one on one that's what I'd like to know. He's a security guy so I don't get it. Let's suppose hypothetically that everything CW says is true and all the reasons he gave for not publicly providing proof that he is SN are legit. Okay fine.
But why would GA not come out and say "Nobody should believe me or CW without proof." Isn't that a major premise of this whole endeavor? Trustless system means I don't have to take your word for it no matter who you are. We have a system in place for that. Why is he trying to circumvent that?
Even the supposition that someone "got to" him wouldn't make much sense. He was already a big blocker so there's no reason to pressure him into that. And if you have a major asset you want to use destroying their credibility makes them less valuable.
So why did he do it?

Yes. Addresses are deterministically (consistent, repeatable) generated from a private key. So anybody who knows the private key which generates a public address can move funds set to that address. They don't have to "do" anything as far as creating an address or whatnot. They just have to know it in their head.
This means they can perform this process on a non internet connected device.

Leading up to the whole CW he was writing a bunch of blog posts about the block size debate. Towards the end he was clearly leaning towards bigger blocks. (At the time I was as well.) So I don't think anybody got to him. Actually, I think if he *had* admitted to the mistake with regard to CW it would have resulted in better terms between BCH/BTC. He's a superb communicator and was well respected. I think that would have been mostly preserved even within the small blocker community as he went to the big block side but he spent all that respect on refusing to fess up to a mistake.

Hey man buying small fiat amounts back in 2014 is how a lot of us got here. My story was similar as investing in bitcoin replaced other less healthy entertainment purchases. I started weighing the amount of bitcoin I could buy against going out to eat or going to the bar. I had a lot of confidence that it would grow but ultimately if it crashed all I had lost was a bunch of empty calories.

@_date: 2018-01-06 18:45:56
It's so frustrating dealing with those people. Something about being a part of moving all that money around makes them feel like they know something about it or are a part of it. They get really snooty and start telling you how things are. A few years ago I tried to suggest to my bank that I should be able to attach some personal details to charges on my account. Just for taking notes and tracking my finances.
"That's a security issue."
They couldn't tell me how. That was also a security issue. They couldn't give any explanation that made sense. Eventually I was so pissed I told them I'm sick of the way they use "security" to end any conversation they don't want to have. If they keep it up long enough they will dilute the term until it means *literally* nothing and then they'll have no way to distinguish between "security" and "no really you shouldn't do that you'll lose money". They'll blame customers for being "stupid" when this happens but the reality is that they treat people like idiots and don't give them any real information so they lack the ability to make intelligent decisions. And this isn't the fault of the company as a whole. It starts with the individual employees. They all participate willingly in this charade and never stop and think about how they're going to have to deal with the fallout of collective personal decisions at some point.
They didn't have much to say after that.
I don't think fiat is going away but I'm looking forward to the day when I can close my bank account for good.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:12:17
It does need more than one store of value to work. Decentralization is a good thing.
I'm not terribly concerned with the speculative issues. Ultimately that problem has to do with people investing in things they don't understand. I would be concerned if I felt like the information was difficult to access or digest but I don't think that's the case. Understanding the difference between a good digital currency and a scam takes some effort. People will either pay in effort or pay by losing money on a bad investment. Certainly there's room for improvement on our end but that seems to be happening organically as well. Andreas is only the most well known educator but there are dozens of other people creating educational content. We as a community are doing our part to educate but it has to be a two way street.

I more or less agree with everything you said here. I think we agree that we should continuously strive to make Bitcoin the best that it can be and we just disagree that if Bitcoin is the best that it can be it will necessarily take a 50%+ share of the Crypto market cap. (Then again I might have misinterpreted you.)
I do think that bitcoin's usefulness is related to it's Crypto market share but given how measurements aren't regulated it's very difficult to say how much of a market share it has, how much is the ideal and so on. All I know for sure is that I'm happy there are competing coins.

Compare November 2013 - November 2015 to November 2015 - November 2016
In the first chart you can see every small uptick resulted in an even lower price just a few days or weeks after. It was extremely discouraging as "good news" for bitcoin only seemed to drive the price high enough for more people to bail out and the floor to fall even lower.
Though a lot of us were mentally prepared for the price to drop to zero we did have some hope that the next halvening would do... something. Anybody who had got in late 2013 had really only witnessed bitcoin drop in value and for no *good* reason so far as we could see. The developers were active. The node count was good. The miners were being careful to stay away from 51%+ control. We all coughed it up to [the bitcoin economy being displeased with us](
So around November 2015 we started seeing the price rise and attributed it to anticipation for the upcoming halvening. Thing is, we expected the same thing to happen. The crash would send the floor even lower... but this time it didn't. It hung on. The halvening happened and... alright the price didn't move much. People already bought in anticipation and it's about to drop... Still not dropping. Still not dropping. Hey... it's... rising?
And we've been on that rise since.

"All in" on anything is gambling. I actually agree with you to an extent on school. When people say "I'm going to go to school for ______ and will have $300,000+ debt when I get out." that sounds an awful lot like going "all in" to me. Of course it depends on what kind of safety nets they have.
Informally the major difference I see between investing and gambling is that you diversify. There are ways to diversify between your education, your living situation and other investments responsibly. And of course, everybody is going to tweak each one of those to suit their individuality. Some people aren't worried about sleeping in their car. Some people are going for skills training rather than a degree. Some people don't want to invest in bitcoin.

Hodlers generally aren't interested in returning to fiat. Sometimes it's necessary due to governmental regulations but we're talking about buying property or paying off student loans. They're not "dumping" BTC in these cases. They recognize the value of BTC but they want to use it to buy something.
There are plenty of ways to lose money with investments and plenty of people will do that. However, we believe that over the long term that bitcoin will rise or at the very least retain it's value. That is to say, we believe that if you buy now at $11k while the price may fluctuate you will have the opportunity to sell again for at least $11k adjusted for inflation.
That being said there are a number of risks that could change this belief. Regulation, issues establishing consensus in the future, bugs etc...

That being said, people are overly negative about LN development timeline. Some people think transaction times have already been solved and so they're frustrated by the BTC devs who won't implement these changes. The problem that BTCers tend to see is that all the alternatives presented centralize control of the cryptocurrency they've been implemented on. It's a bit difficult to say who's right or wrong.
Regardless, BTC is banking on the LN and it's taking some time and some people are frustrated.
From my perspective I think people are underestimating the amount of testing and development that goes into something like this and don't appreciate the need to go slowly. The longer people get to play with it in the testing phase the less likely any security issues will be discovered after the fact.

Are we capable of addressing every problem at once or not? If not then we have to prioritize. And I don't know what you think but I know that if corporate interests begin controlling all forms of media you can forget saving anybody where there isn't a financial incentive to do so.
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that big pharma sees a financial incentive to cure people rather than keep them alive but sick. Tell me that rather than deal with the public outcry they won't just reach out to ISPs to suppress any media pointing this out. Tell me that without any financial incentive or public knowledge this problem will get resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:57:04
This problem is a much lower priority.

They're not going "elsewhere". They're just going back to the same broken system which is (surprise!) still broken. Bitcoin will eventually pull these people back because Bitcoin is still *improving* while existing systems have no intention of changing anything.

@_date: 2017-12-04 07:32:25
Not if people are investing more than they're willing to lose. A standard correction could set off a chain reaction of people realizing that if bitcoin tanks so do their lives. The only people left will be the hodlers and who knows how low the price would need to go before a new batch of hodlers joins up.

I think he's just pissed because he believes the terms exist to describe every kind of legitimate investment that exists and he can't grok the idea that no terms exist in his jargon to explain it.
So then people drop back to technical jargon where the terms do exist but since he has no solid understanding of any of those terms he gets frustrated and assumes we're trying to confuse the issue by using marketing language. And to a degree I respect his skepticism. He has no way of telling the difference between the technical implementation of bitcoin or a scam coin. We all know the latter exists but many of us have the technical understanding to make the distinction. He doesn't and so he's erring on the side of caution when he looks at all Cryptos as if they could be scams.
I saw this happen in a lot of industries as we started writing enterprise applications for them and digitizing their content. Suddenly their rules and jargon all came second to the rules and jargon of a programmer. And not because it's some kind of pissing contest, though that's how they saw it, but because if your rules and jargon can't be translated into technical rules and jargon it's because you've made a logical error. Often those logical errors have persisted for decades either within the particular company we were working with or their whole industry. Nobody wanted to hear they had been making a mistake for twenty years.
It seems like that's what's happening here. The financial industry has made some assumptions that are at risk of becoming known to be false. It's still a bit early to make that call but it looks like the SEC is ready to admit some common understandings of the financial industry are suspect and the guy asking the questions is freaking out when he hears that.
If I had been in the room I would have liked to say "At the end of the day I don't know enough about your industry to answer your questions. What I do know is we have created a ledger that is independently verifiable and can be used to signal ownership of particular pieces of data within the context of that ledger. How the financial industry decides to describe such a thing and theorize why people value it is likely to take some time but the idea that we could come up with that at a time when there are so few individuals with both the technical and financial knowledge to bridge the gap is unrealistic."

Very little affect on bitcoin. Abolishing net neutrality will unlikely result in outright blockage of any websites right away. I say this not because I think ISPs are above it but because they'll have to appease the public somehow and people are already pretty pissed.
So what that means is that they'll cripple speeds. Fortunately a bitcoin transaction is orders of magnitude smaller than your typical website so there won't be a noticeable impact there.
Nodes may suffer but it's difficult to say how. Are senders going to be charged or receivers? How does it affect nodes running in cloud services like AWS?

You're acting as if there's an obvious alternative. Large blocks don't solve the problem they just kick the can down the road.
And if you don't trust LN there's nothing forcing you to use it. Pay the fee for a highly decentralized system when you need that kind of thing. Is that level of security really necessary for buying coffee?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:22:44
1. We can't solve every problem therefore we must prioritize.
2. Net neutrality is being threatened which is a key component in our ability to address the issues SENS is trying to fix and other serious issues like global warming therefore net neutrality has a higher priority.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:58:16
Well all I can do is continue to advise that people don't and hope it has an impact.

Defending net neutrality and fighting corporate takeover seems like a much more effective way to save lives to me.

Love it. The way you describe it I can almost appreciate all the regulatory bullshit that makes it difficult for people to buy in. It does a good job of eliminating any buyers who would get in and then bail over a news article like this. All the people who this would work on just didn't buy in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:34:25
You tell me. How do they prevent tampering with the ledger without using a block chain? Do they have mining? Where's the incentive for consensus?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:31:21
Generally speaking a decrease in supply results in an increase in price... but it's not a sure thing. Sometimes the market *expects* the price to increase so everybody buys up ahead of time... and then the price doesn't increase and people panic so it drops. Hard to say.
That being said, the last halvening was in June of 2016 and what began this whole run up we're in right now.

What you're describing is very different than the comment you're replying to IMO. You're advocating forgoing current comforts in order that you can afford to take greater risks without long term damage to your livelihood. The commenter above you seems to be advocating having both the comforts and taking the risk which means if something goes wrong there's very little chance of recovery.

The number of transactions the network processes is nearly unrelated to energy consumption. Handling more transactions just takes more bandwidth. The Bitcoin community isn't prepared to require people to have broadband internet access in order to participate. And that shouldn't be an issue because if we're mistaken the world is ready another Crypto can show us the way. In the mean time this is the path we've chosen.

First, no shit, everyone with a node is "monitoring bitcoins".
Second, no shit, the NSA is siphoning off data. Snowden told us.
Third, no shit, "monitoring" is about all they do these days. Not "innovate" not "support" not "research". Our government is afraid of everything.
Fourth, no shit, they're monitoring because they answer to all the megacorps who see it as a threat to their bottom line.
So no shit white house. Wake me up when you do something different for a change.

I started looking into it after the December crash in 2013 and decided I made a mistake. It was a long road to get here and I'm glad I made it.
I think bitcoin still has a long way to go and I'm glad we've got one more hodler on board. :)

When the boomers were the age of millenials they had 33% of the vote in major elections after adjusting for voting participation rates.
By 2008 even if voting participation rates had held (they didn't) we would have had 26% percent of the vote. That's a huge loss. What it means is that our democracy has heavily slanted towards people in their late 40s or above. Politicians continue to use wedge issues that concern that generation and the younger generations get to chose between the pro-abortion/pro-medicare candidate and the anti-abortion/anti-medicare candidate.
Meanwhile all the issues which affect younger generations, those going out into the world trying to get an *education* trying to afford *health insurance* and not to get *shot* or *mugged* by *police* because they might have *weed* on them are largely ignored.

I'm pretty happy with my situation all things considered. Buying bitcoin definitely helped me get there.

You've got a tendency to ramble.
The point is, if big pharma can pay Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T to suppress messages about healthcare reform in this country it won't matter where you put healthcare on the priority list anymore.
See how that works? If you spend resources on at-risk causes which dependent other at-risk causes you risk losing both. Secure the foundation and build. Doing things out of order might feel good emotionally but logically it makes no sense.

You're not wrong but also consider there are 4 billion people in the world who don't have a bank account. That means no credit card and so they cannot use Apple pay.

Because if that strategy worked nobody would lose money in the markets.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:56:11
Because the baby boomers had plenty of money to support this research themselves. They chose to spend it elsewhere. That doesn't make it our responsibility 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:59:34
That was an extremely nontechnical analysis. You're right that marketers will try to co-opt terms. They do that by glossing over technical details which is exactly what you just did. If you don't have the ability to describe in technical detail how it works you shouldn't turn around and try to claim the terms are vague.

Netflix doesn't care anymore. They've since deployed their servers to all major ISPs. You can see this yourself.
1. Download a packet sniffer.
2. Run the packet sniffer.
3. Stream a movie from netflix.
4. Note the IP address where all the traffic is coming from.
5. Perform a tracert command on the IP
You'll see that the IP address is only three or four hops away from you. Your router, the entry point into the ISP, maybe one more entry point and then the Netflix server.
That's why Netflix wasn't very vocal this time around. They don't care anymore.

I think your fud is mostly around our ability to preserve the reputation of bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't going to be flawless. At the end of the day it's money and people will figure out how to game it on some scale and use it for unethical ends. I don't know that there's a way to avoid this entirely. With larger adoption comes some level of corruption. Stop fearing imperfection.
We need only fear perfection if perfection already exists. It doesn't. Cryptocurrencies biggest competitors are struggling right now. Trump gave USD an uptick but who knows if that'll hold. Other first world countries have already implemented negative interest rates. These forms of money cost money to store safely and can only be stored by handing it off to some very seedy people. And that's the *best* case here in first world countries. Take a look at third world countries and your digital balance being wiped "because fuck you that's why" isn't unheard of. There is nothing uncertain about the fact that people around the world are desperate for a way to store wealth safely.
So that's the fear and uncertainty. What about doubt?
Keep it. That's what will help us avoid catastrophic mistakes. Keep doubting bitcoin. Keep trying to think how someone is going to try to fuck this up.
We can't stop dumb money from coming in. All we can keep repeating is "don't invest more than you're willing to lose". That mantra is powerful. It sets up the expectation early and absolves us of any accusations that we misled people. Cryptocurrencies are risky. They may crash.
We can also turn dumb money into start money by educating people. "Hodl". Don't pull your money out just because there's a fluctuation. Don't pull it out just so you can run back to fiat. Don't pull it out to buy dumb shit. But do use it to financially secure yourself and your family. Buy yourself a practical house. Pay off your practical car. Diversify into other investments you're more familiar with... and if you have enough for whatever your "Lambo" is do that too. Maybe it's an international trip you always wanted to take. Maybe you've never had a nice TV. Entertainment is important. Just be smart about it.

There was an extended bear market after one of the big exchanges crashed and caused a lot of people to believe something was inherently flawed with bitcoin.
Of course that could still be true but so far that hasn't turned out to be the case. Anyway, enough people held on long enough for the reward halving which gave us a little bit of an upswing. That turned into a much more aggressive bull market and here we are.
It did gain a *lot* over the past few months and those of us who have been in this for a while are expecting it to drop again. Of course we have no way of knowing but we don't want to lead on noobs with false hope.
That being said, we have much more optimistic outlooks on the longer (~2-3 year) term.

The thing is you're trying to straddle two sides here.

You can't have it both ways.

You need to figure out the exact size of the transaction and do the calculation yourself to figure out what's the minimum fee you could pay to get it to process in the next 24h or so.
To anyone thinking "Oh man that's too advanced for people." well yeah. But OP got into mining which isn't for the faint of heart.

You don't need special software to avoid a replay attack. You just need to first move coins in both chains to non-identical addresses you control. If a replay attack occurs there's minimal damage since you can simply try again.
And of course, this is only relevant if you care about both coins. I'm skeptical Segwit2x will maintain it's value for long so the whole conversation becomes a moot point. Who cares if someone replays your transaction on the 2x chain if those coins are worth less than a dollar?

@_date: 2017-08-30 17:11:50
I can try.
Lately the efficiency of bitcoin has been measured by the fees for a transaction. Unlike traditional banking the value of the bitcoin being transferred does not relate to the fee you pay. Fees are driven by the size (read: number of bytes) in your transaction.
Size of a transaction is a bit difficult to predict unless you're intimately familiar with your wallet. Ultimately it depends on the number of inputs you're using and specifying that requires a bit of technical knowledge.
Still, transactions from segwit addresses have the advantage of being able to leave out certain information so generally speaking they will always be smaller.
This post is saying how much bitcoin people are paying per transaction byte. 0-5 is really low. We haven't seen fees that low in years. So it's a good thing but people are skeptical how long it will last.

Fair enough, it's just frustrating to hear this because what you're talking about has *nothing* to do with Bitcoin. 
The only reason liquidity is even a concern is because you are required to convert BTC into Fiat before purchasing a house. And all the reasons for that have nothing to do with bitcoin. It has to do with regulations, financial incentives, security theater and power. These are *massive* problems that need a solution and have for decades. Bitcoin's success isn't dependent on solving these problems but it does get us one step closer.
To re-iterate: the onerous KYC/AML regulations which only apply to you and me are not a failure of bitcoin. The strained and aging financial networks are not a failure of bitcoin. The digital pseudo security practices which are more about protecting financial industry interests than you are not a failure of bitcoin.
What you need to ask yourself is why is your instinct to blame bitcoin for this stuff? All you need to do is turn around and look at all the faces of the people who are telling you to do that and start asking why they aren't working *with* the bitcoin community to resolve these issues.

The block chain forked so coinbase had X Bitcoin on the pre-fork chain. So they have X on the bitcoin chain and X on the BCH chain.
Where it gets complicated is that coinbase users don't own bitcoin. They own bitcoin vouchers. So the argument is whatever the voucher value was at the time of the fork obligates coinbase to a BCH voucher of that same value to their users.

High risk investments are probably a bad choice then.

The community mantra is "don't invest more than you're willing to lose". If that's a few hundred for you that's perfect.
Back in 2015 bitcoins were selling for $200 and we seem to be on our way to $10,000.
Of course past performance is not an indicator of future success. So do the research you feel is necessary.
Also: you don't have to buy whole bitcoins. It's likely were going to start talking about the mbtc denomination (1/1000 of a bitcoin) soon.

Of course new discussions are always more fun. But they're only fun if people participate and people only participate if they feel the participation rules are pretty lax. (On topic, don't be a dick, don't spam)

I wonder if there's some research about that phenomenon. If you have a lot of money to invest, know how to invest or are connected people who are willing to let you ride along there's lots of investment opportunities out there.
I wonder what someone who's made a career out of finance would say if you asked "Do you believe there are a *lot* of people with very small amounts available to invest (less than $100) who aren't sufficiently incentivized by the available investment options?"
I mean the simplest investment is a savings account but those are ~1% these days.
Stocks might be a bit higher but the educational and paperwork barrier is pretty high.
401ks are easy enough but you can't touch it until you're retired so it's not realistic for people who are living month to month.
Housing used to be how most people accumulated a nice pile of wealth but these days it's well out of reach for most.
Maybe bitcoin is just that: An indicator of how much small investment money financial institutions and governments have left out in the cold.

The amount of public drama that came out of this made us all look bad. I hope the next time there's a big decision to be made and a fork follows we can all remain civil *on both sides*. The calls for criminal charges from some small block advocates were embarrassing.
Anyway that's my word vomit. Hope you can join us again and we can agree to disagree on this and focus on taking over the world.

No need to be so negative. It's no secret that there are lots of "nerds" don't know how to interact with women. How about coming up with a better meme or something to show people who want to do better what some ideas would be?

There currently aren't any signs that things are slowing down if that's what you're asking.
But of course there are no guarantees.
A general recommendation for newbies is to choose an amount and buy that amount over a month. It helps you see a range as acceptable and not obsess over a specific price point.
With regard to fees there little to zero difference in fees between a bunch of small buys and a single large buy. Go on coinbase and the structure is pretty straightforward. (1.49%) If you deposit into coinbase and then transfer to gdax it's only 0.25%.

The hodl mentality is basically the counter perspective to "bitcoin is a bubble". Hodlers believe bitcoin itself has value and you should use it to buy other things of value... Don't invest so you can just drop back to putting more fiat in the bank.

Rules for investing in bitcoin:
1. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.
2. Don't buy all at once. Buy over a period of a few days or weeks.
3. Learn about the technology! Bitcoin is based on cryptographic algorithms you use every day without realizing it. You don't have to become an expert. Just learn what a hashing function is. Read about public key and private key encryption.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:44
Bitcoin can be used as a global currency (in theory) so you can look at the current market cap and compare it to the market caps of other currencies to get an idea of what might be possible.
Just bear in mind, nothing like this has ever existed, bitcoin isn't the only crypto currency, there could be unforseen issues which cause catastrophic failures etc. Personally I think it's a great investment but I don't want you going in without knowing something about the risks you're taking on.
The community mantra is "don't invest more than you're willing to lose".
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:14:18
Yep. I've stopped worrying about transaction fees ever since I learned atomic swaps were a thing. It's perfect. Bitcoin is your savings account. Other Cryptos can fill the checking account spaces.

I closed my credit card with them last year. When they asked why I said "I think your CEO is an asshole and I'm tired of him trash talking bitcoin." I don't think they had any idea what I was talking about at the time. I wonder if they remembered me when all that "bitcoin is a fraud" stuff was going on.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:33:03
I believe their plan is to match your bitcoin at the time of the fork 1:1. So if you had .3254 btc on August 1st then at some point you'll be given .3254 BCH. The price of fiat doesn't factor into the equation.

Bitcoin enthusiast here: Please don't.
Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. If you and a bunch of people start using high-interest loans hoping for big paydays bitcoin will become the bubble everyone claims it is.
Right now the investments are fairly healthy because people are putting in money they don't feel they have to pull out when bitcoin shows some negative price movements. (Which it will.)

You need to attempt a brute force on it. Also ask lastpass if they can recover old passwords. There's really no reason for them to actually delete one of your passwords since it takes up a trivial amount of space. Odds are they just hid it from view.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:59:05
1. The private key is made with a sha256 hash. The odds of an accidental collision are basically zero. I don't know the specific method they use but its likely as simple as incrementing an index by one for each new private key.
2. Yes and no. The block chain doesn't keep running totals so if you want to know the balance yes you have to scan the whole thing. But if you already know an unspent output you can sign a transaction with it as an input and send it. If it turns out somebody already spent it the nodes will reject the transaction.

Well, I'm not sure that's how it would work but you're right it would suck.
But not just for bitcoin. The block chain blocks are pretty small and mining outfits are efficient about what data they send out to the miners. The cost would be non trivial but survivable.
But the thing is, a single Netflix movie takes more bandwidth than running a node for a day. So it's unlikely bitcoin is where people would be noticing a difference.

To clarify, quantum computers will be able to crack elliptical curve crypto. Meaning a re-used address is vulnerable. Reversing hashes, the approach needed to crack an address with a balance that has never been spent, is not as vulnerable to quantum computing.

Every crypto currency has a client of some sort. They provide functionality to use your computer as a wallet, node or a miner. The bitcoin core client was the first for bitcoin. Some might say the "original" but as the code and developers on the git repo change that doesn't really mean much. There are other bitcoin clients which are compatible with the bitcoin network. I believe lukejr has his own fork with some minor adjustments which allow for blacklisting of some kind. The BCH client is a fork of the bitcoin core client but it uses an (intentionally) incompatible protocol with the bitcoin core clients.

I'm glad to hear you're new to the space and already have the "don't invest more than you're willing to lose" mantra ingrained. I think the community effort to underscore the risks, even if it means scaring off some people, is fundamental to our survival. If people come in with typical expectations about an investment such as low volatility, low impacts of making a mistake etc they're going to be very disappointed and ultimately will be turned off by the experience.
We want everybody to be aware of all the risks and make an informed decision if they still want to be involved.
In other words, we preach and practice transparency.

You're probably in the right mindset then. Of course, this does depend on what the bitcoin price does in the meantime. But if you're saying you're OK with getting $600-$500 worth of bitcoin at the current market value I'd say go for it.
Bear in mind, I've never mined before personally. But I do run a node and it costs me around $80 a month and there's no reward. So I'm partially encouraging you from the mindset that people like us strengthen the network.

OK cool. Yeah so it definitely created the file somewhere. You can check here to figure out where it is.
I highly recommend you back it up the moment you find it. Put it on a thumb drive, burn it to a CD or something. Just get a copy on two physically separate locations.
I do not advise uploading it to Dropbox or google drive unless you encrypt it first. You can do that with a zip application like 7zip fairly easily.
Once you've done that your bitcoin will be fairly safe. Just proceed with caution. Feel free to ask around before taking actions so people can advise you on the potential pitfalls.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:55:16
We can because this is as true today as it was then:
"Not your keys, not your coins."
What every exchange gives you is essentially a voucher for bitcoins. A voucher that can be revoked, lost or stolen. You cannot benefit from the real digital security of bitcoin if you leave it on an exchange.
Some people are okay with that and that's fine too. Just giving people the full picture.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:40:26
And the most difficult chain to thwart is the longest one because in order to do so you'd have to mine faster than everybody else. So the nodes are programmed to agree: "the longest chain wins"

Yeah the most effective response I have to my peers when they start talking about the potential problems with bitcoin is: "Yeah it's risky but it's a good alternative."
I have a 401k but honestly that strategy is: "Hand your money over to rich people to ~~work~~play with." I mean sure, it's not the dumbest idea ever. But when you look at it that way no millennial is going to feel *good* about putting money into a 401k after the 2008 crash. It's more of a necessary evil.
Bitcoin doesn't have that moral negative. Putting money into it doesn't offend my principles. I'm not taking advantage of third world countries. I'm not supporting child labor. I'm not advocating for the erosion of human rights. That being said, I'm not naive enough to think Bitcoin is flawless or won't accumulate it's own set of morally questionable attributes. But for now it's a decent alternative.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:57:44

True. Also I thought it was interesting that the CPU distinguishes between an undefined call and a call that must be made in another mode. (I probably screwed up the terminology there.)
When you look at file based security the system makes no distinction between "File not found" and "Access is denied". I'm wondering if this was an architectural necessity or an oversight.

Replay protection is only a concern for the sender. As the receiver you stand to gain from a replay attack.
And yes you only need to worry about replay attacks when spending bitcoin you received before the fork.
Another note: none of this is relevant if you only care about one of the coins. A replay attack on a chain you don't care about isn't a problem. True you might be able to make a few bucks on that second coin but it's not the end of the world. I have some BCH right now due to that split but by the time I move my BTC the BCH probably won't be worth anything.

You can try sending a more reasonable fee. The backlog is pretty low right now you might get lucky.
Still though, I gotta ask why do you have so many inputs?
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:16:06
100 people come at you with a hash. Who do you believe? Who do *they* believe? It would be chaos. Like claiming who has the right to the throne.
Now say 100 people have a bitcoin chain. Which is real? Well of course it has to be valid. All the hashes of the merkle tree have to line up. But that falls prey to a single hash. Pretty easy to spoof. What isn't easy to spoof, and arguably what is impossible to spoof is the *longest* chain. If you manage to "fake" that, guess what, you're a miner now.
The bitcoin block chain doesn't just show transactions. It shows how much computing power was required to generate it.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:00:33
The counter perspective to that is that it destroys a significant portion of the incentive to find alternatives which would not require individuals go into debt to acquire them.
In other words, debt is only good because you need it to operate within the system it necessitates.

This kind of thing is pretty far outside my wheelhouse but I'd really like to run it against the CPUs used in raspberry pis. Though because those are ARM architecture and this is targeted for x86 I'm not sure what the level of effort would be.

**don't delete bitcoin core**
Assuming you created the wallet through the client there is a file called wallet.DAT that has your private key. This key can be used on a number of wallets that do not require you to download the whole chain.
Until you've got another wallet set up with this private key and confirmed you can send the money do not lose that file or you will be hosed.
Also, now may be a good time to read up on: hashes, public and private key encryption, digital signatures. These concepts will help you understand what you need to spend bitcoin from different wallets and how to do so securely.
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:31:58
I didn't say you couldn't criticize. But you said that's not what you were doing. Are you criticizing bitcoin or not?
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:01:55
Right, but the opinions of what constitute a healthy society and whether or not the society in which you live is healthy depends too much on anecdotal experience for any debate to draw any reasonable conclusions.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:40:05
Can you describe how you did that? Without a hardware wallet you'd have to enter in your seed or a key or something which is used to sign the transaction and authorizes the sending of your bitcoin. Entering that piece of information on a desktop is dangerous. More dangerous than a phone in many cases.

I'm sorry I'm not understanding the meaning of your comment.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:05:39
I don't see the difference.
Honestly I'd be happy if by the time I use my bitcoin to buy something I've got a nice 6-10% interest on it. In my mind the potential is that I saved for my retirement without trusting someone else with my money or contributing to the corrupt banking industry. Anything else is just sugar on top.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:10:59
Yup and then you won't be able to get back into the U.S.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:21:38
This really doesn't seem worth talking about IMO. To oursiders it makes all of us in the cryptocurrency community look like a bunch of drama babies. We should ignore Roger Ver and concentrate on educating everyone how they can protect themselves from this next generation attack on bitcoin. Ignore the person and make bitcoin stronger. That's my vote.
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:15:32
Say it's four years later. What would you $25 buy have to be worth for you to look back and say this purchase was a good decision?

Fixed. :P

Oh well of course if we assume your perception of reality is actual reality then it wouldn't be rude. You'd just be stating facts. But we don't make that assumption here. So it's rude and garnished. :)
Have a good night.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:36:23
Why would you assume it was an automated process?
The camera only kicks on when the machine is being used. You could probably review the entire month of transactions in a couple hours.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:07:37
You have a couple in depth explanations here. So I'll try to keep it simpler.
If you are planning on hodling that's all you need to do. You should look into setting up a paper wallet or a hardware wallet. The problem with keeping your coins in coinbase is you're at the mercy of their decisions. If you control your own keys none of this really matters until you're ready to sell or use bitcoin to buy something.
A fork is nothing more than someone copying the bitcoin transaction history and then using different rules to say what is a valid transaction. If you own bitcoin now congratulations you'll soon own both bitcoin and 2x. You don't have to do anything. People will argue about which ledger is the real one but both ledgers will still say you have a balance.
In short:
1. Learn how to set up a paper or hardware wallet.
2. Move your coinbase balance into that wallet.
3. Hodl.
Hope this helps. :) feel free to message me if you have other questions.

Why not either depending on what's going on? If bitcoin is volatile but trends upwards, then people will use it as an investment. If bitcoin loses its volatility then people will feel more inclined to use it like currency.
Do we need to worry about which one it is?

Anyway, I dunno what you're on about with that safe space bullshit. I'm not calling for moderator intervention here. I just suggested the guy try to be civil seeing as this topic has been argued to death. Seems like people like you and the commenter I'm responsible won't be happy until we all cave to your demands or discuss nothing but the block size while hurling insults at each other.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:00:07
Hubris, power, more money... who knows. Ultimately it doesn't really matter. The long term viability of any change to bitcoin is what matters and ultimately I and a lot of other people don't agree this is the way to go. I started off being a big blocker too but ironically half way through Gavin's blog series on the subject I started to understand the counter perspective.

Using the belief that your perception of reality is actual reality to justify your behavior is how religious wars are started. Because everybody believes they're right. It doesn't give you carte blanche to act like a dick.

What do you think of Monero?
To be up front, I'm stoked about it. The mere existence of an untraceable currency combined with atomic swaps protects the fungability of all cryptos.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:13:51


That's impolite *and* garnished language my friend. :)
Anyway, I too don't care about personalities, politics or status signalling either. I do care about contributions to the community though. Whether they're in the form of running a node, creating educational content or making pull requests to the project.
If you don't do any of that then yes I agree. You are nobody.

It could. But what all the hodlers ultimately believe is that any dip will be temporary.
Nobody is gonna have an answer that will make you sure this is a good jumping off point because nobody knows.
If you want in, buy what you can afford to lose, store your keys somewhere safe and forget about it for a year.

Dude, coming in here with that attitude is pretty disrespectful at this point. It's cool that's your perspective but when you're voicing it in this sub you should be polite. You've got the space to say whatever you like however you like. The people in this sub don't agree with you and being an asshole isn't going to change that.
Besides, I know who is and what they've done for bitcoin... who are you and what makes you qualified to wag your finger at others?

If the majority of the miners move to 2X this could freeze the btc chain.

That gap is closing though. Two people who I mentioned bitcoin to ages ago finally got Coinbase accounts and bought in. One of them bought at $4200 and had some questions about the drop in price but seems pretty comfortable riding the hodler coaster since he's seen me do the same thing over the years.

"I'm not telling you to sell but bitcoin is dangerous and you'd be stupid not to."
That about sum up your post? Neat. If you want to invest in the stock market good for you. No need to come in here and wag your fingers at people who are interested in alternatives to handing over their hard earned money to the people who caused the crash of '08.

I'd say it's more nihilistic than anti-capitalist. Some of the main characters express concern that what they're doing/did is "monumentally stupid" while not being represented as villains for doing so.
I think the show does a good job of representing our generation's discontent for the existing system without having a clue what to do about it.

Just a general note, the tone of the article is a little too "pro-bitcoin" and it can make an unfamiliar reader uncomfortable as it starts to sound like a sales pitch. For example:


This statement is over-eager to represent bitcoin positively. I'd recommend going with a more neutral overview of what's happening:

I'm too lazy to look it up but off the top of my head what people refer to as a "bullet" is really a cartridge. Which has a casing for containing the gunpowder and the bullet which is what gets ejected from the firearm. I believe casings are made of brass while bullets are made of lead. So "brass and lead" refers to the general makeup of a cartridge.

Download a bootable Linux distro, burn it to a CD. Download bit address, put it on a thumb drive. Etc...
