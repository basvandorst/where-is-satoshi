how is a novice asking how others started a stupid question? 
I'm just asking about my financial position which is something a youtube video probably couldn't do. The whole point of this is that I trust this subreddit more where people with experience can easily answer my questions upfront. Also you could drop the elitism, I'm really just asking questions and I'm thankful for the other information you gave me.

I'm originally from italy and currently living in malaysia, any non-malaysian is automatically declined job applications at most small places like local supermarkets and 7-11's :/. They keep bringing up the excuse that customers wouldn't feel comfortable with foreign cashiers but tbf that really just shows even more racism.
But thanks for the info! about alternatives I've looked a bit into litecoins but the information I found on those is pretty vague, their official website doesn't make me understand much about it other than it's faster to obtain and cheaper than bitcoin while not giving me information on any actual software or hardware to be used.

sounds reasonable, my parents have always told me about percentage increases (in things like banks) and how you should wait many years. But honestly for me (as a teen) even just getting a 500+ dollar gain is a lot, so I won't be aiming for astronomical numbers. I got big payments for my uni and other possible life events already sorted out so bitcoin is more of a thing to seek out some small monetary gain I can get so to replace my jobless status. TBH I'm also willing to wait out many years for any monetary gain.
