Hashing power = Bitcoin. If all Bitcoin's hashing power moves to a SHA256 shitcoin = it has all the hashing power = it is Bitcoin. 
You should really learn about logic, if a train of thought or reasoning is not self-consistently applied everywhere equally, it is not a logical line of reasoning. Your reasoning is not logical.

There doesn't need to be "support" in wallet. Its already supported because wallets support sending transactions. Users just need to be aware they can spend an unconfirmed transaction and miners will consider the related chain and not just individual transactions.
This is a communication problem, not a software problem. 
EDIT: And you do not understand how CPFP works. Otherwise you would understand why its beyond retarded to say "support for senders." If you aren't sending to yourself, **you don't have the key necessary to make use of CPFP**. CPFP is ONLY for receivers, RBF handles the same issue from the side of senders. Nice attempt to throw around the insult Aspergers and try to create the false impression you knew what you were talking about.

No its not. Its a network of peer to peer nodes keeping a ledger within the bounds of a ruleset. All miners do is propose blocks to add to the ledger, and *nodes* either reject or accept it **based on whether it follows the rules**.
If its just a hashing contest, then there only need to be one copy of the blockchain. If there is only one copy of the blockchain, **its just a regular old database**, and there is absolutely no reason to waste money mining except pissing away money for absolutely no reason. 
If that is what you think Bitcoin is, I think what you are looking for is called Paypal.

Yes it **exactly** equates to centralization. The difficulty in changing rules, such as the rate of issuance, the validity of a transaction depending on a valid unspent coin, the entire structure of the system **is directly proportional to the number of users running nodes**. The less people running nodes, the less people are required to agree in changing rules(anything, the coin supply, the POW algorithm, the security model, anything), and this results in the majority of users being proportionally unable to do ANYTHING to react to node operators changing rules they do not agree with.  If Bitcoins rules can be changed easily, then it is completely worthless, as there is nothing guaranteeing any of the monetary policy staying in tact for the lifetime of the system. 
Mining is not more decentralized than it was, most of the hashing power is in a small number of mining farms split between multiple pools to create the illusion of decentralization, and **%70** of the ASICs are produced by a single company.
The fact that you use the word nerd as an insult implies to me that you are essentially completely technically illiterate, and have absolutely no clue what the fuck you are talking about. You likely have zero understanding on how any of this system works, and have been sold snakeoil in the form of lies told to you with the promise of specific actions you do not even understand rapidly resulting in you becoming wealthy.

Firstly, no I am not being misleading. Secondly, *you* are the one being disingenuous and political. Thirdly, you are an idiot. The quote of Satoshi is 8 years old, and the network *worked completely differently*. Ever single node was a miner. Every single node was a wallet. 
A fee market needs to exist to support miners longterm. Period. Nodes that do not mine *make absolutely nothing*, and **raising the blocksize**, *not people having to pay fees*, is what will make it more burdensome to run a node. 
You took a quote describing the network in its most alpha, unspecialized, and nascent state, and are trying to pass that off as a justification **for your politics** to inform how things work *now*, when the network functions and is structured **totally differently**.

Satoshi. And then after that additions that did not conflict with the rules Satoshi created were added by other developers after agreement from the community.

The only kind of layer 2 systems that non-mining companies have an advantage in are sidechains. Those are totally opt in. When it comes to things like LN, or if Tumblebit type hubs are worked into that, thats not gonna happen. They require coin liquidity.

You are an idiot. 
There was a compromise, it was called segwit and a *proposed* hardfork. Core developers cannot make a hardfork happens if users don't want it. Guess what? Alot of users don't want it.

I love how you trolls do this, you just cut into a comment thread replying to a comment not directed at you and try to confuse the matter to boil it down into a implication of poor character on my part. 
So to break this down. The original commenter I replied to, **not you**, stated that whatever chain he feels like using, or a larger group of people is using, is automatically Bitcoin. That is false. Bitcoin is the blockchain starting from Satoshi's genesis block and being expanded **under the consensus rules it started with**. It doesn't matter if every person in the world is using some other chain forked from Bitcoin except one guy. That original chain is Bitcoin, the new chain is not. Period. If a hardfork is made even with complete consensus, in the strictly technical definition that is still *not Bitcoin*. It is a new network, new token, forked from the original with different rules. The only difference is there will be no one arguing about the strictly technically speaking false use of the name Bitcoin for it, because no one will be using the actual legitimate Bitcoin network, it will be stalled(or dead).
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:20:49

Wrong. Dead fucking wrong. This is not a popularity contest, raising the blocksize beyond what Segwit enables _is not safe_. That is backed up by academic research.

This is not a "I refuse to cause I don't like you!" on the part of those against a hardfork block raise now. I don't care how many people support a stupid and dangerous idea, its still stupid and dangerous and I will not be following if that happens. I believe a majority of the ecosystem is of the same opinion.

A hardfork that is not unanimous is not Bitcoin. It is creating an altcoin. For a hardfork to result in something that is Bitcoin, **everyone** has to go along with it. Otherwise all you are doing is creating an altcoin. 
Luke's discussions of POW changes are in the context of a fork creating an altcoin using the same POW algorithm, which would leave Bitcoin, i.e. the original chain, insecure. There would be unanimous agreement in that case to change POW, otherwise your investment is not secure.
You need to stop being so myopic in your definitions. Braking when driving a car is a word meaning to apply friction to the wheels to create reverse acceleration. Colloquially it is used to mean "stop." When I am barrelling towards a wall at 80 miles an hour, and 20 feet away say "I can't brake" in the technical sense of the word that is completely false. I most definitely can apply friction to the wheels to result in reverse acceleration. The problem is in terms of the colloquial definition, I most definitely cannot stop, and will shortly be smashing into that wall to very disastrous results.

F2Pool broke the agreement first mining Classic. And Luke is still keeping his word and working on a hard fork mechanism that is safe. After code is done, developers can do nothing to force a hardfork. That is up to the users who do or do not run the code.
A hard fork mechanism is being coded, that end of the agreement is being kept. However with nonsense FUD like this people are fed completely conflicting nonsense and being painted a false picture. Segwit is done, its been tested, and now FUD and a small number of influential people are making a concerted effort to stop it rolling out. In the meanwhile, **a hardfork mechanism that is safe is being worked on, as promised**. Certain miners violated the agreement first, and a developer who entered the agreement is still keeping his word in working on a hardfork mechanism. Beyond that there is no more they are capable of, it is up to the users to run it or not.

Its not the miners who decide which fee is right genius, its the market of people paying them. Miners just logically pick the highest paying ones first out of self interest. Thats how the system was designed. 


Its not propaganda for high fees, its technical advice for users whose transactions are not confirmed and they need them to confirm *now.* You are trying to politicize that. That said, Satosh himself specifically intended fees to eventually replace the role of subsidy. Fee income gotta go up.

If you were sending it to yourself you can simply spend the unconfirmed outputs again to an address of yours with a higher fee. Miners will see they must confirm the first one to confirm second and handle both. If its being sent to someone else, Multibit does not support RBF. [Here]( is Multibits "manual" or help page. You will need to figure out how to clear the transaction from your wallet and respend the outputs with a higher fee. You should be able to find help on their forums or in that manual site. I'm sorry I can't offer more help but I've never used Multibit.

If the logic is any new group that comes along demanding irresponsible and nonsensical shit has to be negotiated and compromised with, wake up, Bitcoin is either 1) unchangeable and that in a way is good, or 2) fundamentally broken. I would really hope its number 1 if this is a widespread rationalization of FUDing and stonewalling Segwit in search of "compromise" with what seems to me increasingly more insecure proposed changes to how Bitcoin fundamentally works. 
This is nonsense FUD completely ignoring the entire history of this public nonsense and ignores all the technical facets of it to make it a purely human issue (i.e. "*They're* the ones that are being unreasonable!"). Segwit was the compromise, its the only safe option on the table. Accept that, or lets see if Bitcoin is solidified for the good, or fundamentally broken.

You are beyond stupid and well into the territory of fucking retarded. An ASIC is an Application Specific Integrated Circuit.

And it does it faster **than any CPU can** because it is physically designed to do one task better than any other. 
As AnonymousRev points out, GPUs don't cut it. Governments and companies, if it weren't for ASICs could 51% attack Bitcoin trivially, because of the fact supercomputers are that much more powerful general purpose computing devices than all the GPU and CPUs out there. Its basic fucking math.

One of the biggest points people try to attack and use to prop up the argument "Lightning Network is Vaporware" centers on the routing. They continue to parade the argument that "There is not some unified totally finished and finalized routing protocol, so Lightning Network is useless!" Well...that argument is nonsense. 
The real key to Lightning Network is CLTV and CSV, which allow coins to be deposited into a time-locked multi-sig address with the features supported on Bitcoin to handle conflict resolution. This is done through the way that LN structures its transactions, which are *presigned valid regular old Bitcoin transactions.* Which is really the crux of the issue. 
Thats really all the hard shit. Routing is simply the mechanism by which independent LN nodes establish communications, and handling passing these pre-signed transactions around between a bunch of people acting as relays. The big things here are 1) communication, 2) guaranteeing that balances adjust according along the entire route. You could theoretically right now just shit LN out with the simplest routing protocol possible, and it would work. And it would factually deliver scaling gains right then. They might not be as big as is possible, but they would be scaling gains. And when a better routing protocol is developed, you update and replace the old one(or maintain support for more than one!), and move on. And when you find a better one...update and move on.
So if you can follow the logic here, when someone says "routing isn't figured out because there isn't one single universal protocol completely finished, so Lightning Network is vaporware," know that is a 100% complete bullshit statement.

Updating that will not require altering any Bitcoin consensus rules, in otherwords: the code is done, it is active as soon as it ships and people start pressing buttons. And as well, until routing is in the state it can handle a vibrant decentralized meshnetwork, we can organize hub and spoke payment routes. Again, the fundamental point I am making is the size, the decentralization factor, the topology of payment channels + routing is agile, adaptable, and in no way the gigantic unbelievable nightmare that altering consensus rules is. It changes when the code is done and shipped, and people decide to use it.

You 1) clearly don't understand how Lightning Network works. 2) Clearly have no idea how much more scaling gains can be had by simply being more efficient with the space we have, as opposed to just raising the blocksize and starting the process of perpetually kicking the can down the road with ever increasing opportunity costs.

If you have a desktop, you could run a node there and point an SPV wallet at it. If you run Bitcore on top of bitcoind(the backend of Core) you can point Copay at it. If you run an Electrum server with Core, you can point Electrum at your own server, which gets information from your node. And I also believe Green Address, and Schildbachs(oldest Android wallet) can just be pointed at Core without any other software acting as a middleman.

Yeah...that was said when the Bitcoin price was 0$. Now its around ~900$. We have adopton, and it has become burdensome to run a node. Almost 1000$ a year to run a node on a VPS that keeps the historical chain and transaction index. 
So, ALL CAPS, YOU ARE BEING STUPID. Satoshi said in 2009, its 2017. Also for clarity you refuse to provide, "node" in that context back then meant miner. Because every noded mined before GPU/ASIC mining came around.

That would actually be *very* bad. Miners eventually are going to be dependent on fees and not subsidies for their rewards. In a world where the mempool is constantly drained miners would have not incentive to mine the next block, and every incentive to try and orphan the last block that cleared the mempool to get the fees for themselves. Bitcoin literally requires a stable backlog of transactions for the incentive structure to remain balanced as the subsidy disappears.

Essentially the biggest differences are the formatting for how things are done. Instead of using a new address format, p2sh is used, and instead of reformatting block structure to point to witness data, a merkle root is committed in the coinbase transaction.
From my understanding it is mostly just the way things are structured to ensure things are backwards compatible and do not fork off un-upgraded nodes. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:58:42
My point is, that the payment channel logic is the hard part, and the part that requires modifying Bitcoin. That is done. The entire point I am trying to make is that things can be rolled out and used the second SegWit is live, and that the state or capablity of routing protocols is not a binary sink or swim, has to be done perfectly now or never, issue. After SegWit rolls out, there are no more changes to Bitcoin required, and the routing protocol(s) used by Lighting Network implementations can be rolled up, updated, and used concurrently as we go. And as well, having a less functional routing protocol is something relatively easily fixable, and will not involve anywhere near the headache, time, and animosity that rolling out changes to the core protocol of Bitcoin itself does. You just update it, and clients would in theory be totally capable of being able to handle multiple routing protocols.

If you're currency is hyperinflating, I'd say paying the price of a decent lunch to store any amount of your networth in a much more secure and stable form of value is a steal of a bargain. As well, secondary layers will offer much cheaper and just as secure ways to store and spend your money. It is just as possible to do cold storage in the context of Lightning Network as it is on the main blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 06:55:23
No, this sounds like dunderheads will just assume "Oh no, I can only use Coinbase." Completely ignoring the reality that, for a little delay, and probably a little higher fee, you are 100% capable of establishing and participating in a less centralized LN(as remember, there is no *singular holy LN*, there is just a protocol, and groups of nodes/wallets that choose to connect together using it.)
LN is capable of melding into one singular LN, but that is by no means required, and by no means the only way to do things. You are operating under the fallacious assumption people will only use the faster, cheapest route no matter what. Maybe decentralization is something people will pay for?
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:52:11
That didn't at all answer what it does. So I will answer it for you. It is the chain of events(transactions) connecting the destruction and creation of UTXOs and securing that chain of events with proof of work. The entire purpose of all of this **is to ensure that the destruction and creation of UTXOs**(which are just scripts)**is always balanced out 1:1 minus a fee for miners**. 
I.E. It prevents a single UTXO from being replicated more than once when it is destroyed. I.E. **It enforces the digital scarcity of UTXOs**. The strength of this enforcement is directly proportional to the number of nodes enforcing this in consensus.

Alrighty I'm going to take a crack at it. 
The idea that it will take away fees from miners is ludicrous. Will it allow LN hubs to shave fees off the top? Yes. Will it drastically endanger onchain fees for miners? No. This is blatantly obvious if you look at how channels actually work. Two parties lock up coins in a 2 of 2 multisig address split between them, and then sign a transaction sending their share of the balance of the channel back to each other. (simplifying and leaving out some technical mechanics going forward) From then on all they do to move money through the channel is update that presigned transaction to reflect changes, i.e. it started off with .5 BTC on each side and one person wants to send .1 to the other, they update the transaction to be sending .6 to one and .4 to the other person. Now there is alot of back and forth that this can facilitate, but eventually the direction funds tend to flow is going to move towards one side of the channel or the other, and eventually all or most of the money in the channel will be on one side. Now that channel is only useful for sending money back the other way, so in order to facilitate bi-directional payments, it will have to be closed and another one opened without such a one way balance of funds. *This is why there is no systemic threat to miners*. Eventually if used, **all** channels will have to close, because eventually funds will be unevenly distributed to one side making it unviable for commerce. Obviously to do so miners have to be paid a fee.
Now if you just sit and think for a minute about this, you'll see that things should reach an equilibrium where the fees on LN aren't too much, but are enough to cover the fees on chain a channel operator will eventually have to pay to reorganize when a channel is "done" with its useful lifetime after funds wind up mostly on one side. This fundamentally just delays on-chain fees going up, but over time shouldn't alter the economics of on-chain fees too radically unless the user demand is so great this would have happened even without LN.
And one other thing to point out: Miners have shit tons of coins, and decide what TXes wind up in blocks. So miners themselves, the people who supposedly will get fucked by LN, seem to be in the best place to run big LN hubs. They have the coins, and they pick transactions for each block...so they have a little more influence in keeping fees to open/close channels reasonable at least within their own blocks. 
Hope this helped. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:36:46
BTC_Forever is outright lying to you. This is if you sent from a wallet you control, simply a problem of your wallet software not recognizing the transaction is no longer floating around. Your coins should still be tied to the private key they were before the transaction, it is simply a matter of how to make your software recognize this again. You should consult the reference material for your wallet.
If it was sent from an exchange or other business, all of the above is true, but obviously it is the business you used who will have to make the adjustments with their software and resend the transaction.

I have repeatedly watched you be engaged by others only to literally echo the same phrases and summaries over and over with no concrete response to any critique offered to your statements, and failing to offer anything resembling a critique to their lines of reasoning, just offering the repeated phrase or summary of some notion and the circular logic making it an axiom.
Others have repeatedly attempted to engage you, and explain the lines of reasoning that are behind the complete view of things they hold. You refuse to even let them lay out the lines of reasoning, let alone string them together to show how they are used to arrive at a conclusion. You simply repeat your view, and take it as axiom, offering **assumptions** only to back it up. *Let me repeat that*: Others offer independent lines of reasonings, *based on observations*, that together arrive at a defining picture of the whole. You make assumptions about the operation of things that cannot be based on observations, as the behaviors you make assumptions about have not been implemented anywhere to observe. 
**You are the hostile one, constantly interjecting yourself into a place to have a "debate" but doing nothing but cutting off and dismissing people's arguments before they can be fully articulated, and essentially going "Nope, I'm right.

On a more serious note, I am hardpressed to keep blocks because of idiots like you screaming "Make em'z biggerz NAW! AS BIG AS WE CAN!!!" (Hardpressed means in a bad situation, limited choices, forced into something, .i.e. dealing with idiots demanding things. Its does not mean "Trying hard to do something" the proper word I think you were searching for would be "insistent"). The smaller the blocks, the less bandwidth used, the less latency and orphan rate, the less download time for initial block sync, the less time to validate a block, **meaning**: MORE PEOPLE CAN RUN NODES THAN IF IT WERE HIGHER. 
Why does it matter what percentage of the population can run a node? **Thats how I make sure that when someone sends me a coin, I actually get it. That is how I make sure the coin I get has a valid history. That is how I make sure MINERS OBEY THE RULES.** THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE SURE THE INFLATION CAP ISN'T CHANGED.

You are all types of delusional Mr. Zander. You proclaim in your blog "Bitcoin is decentralized!" and expect that to mean in reality it is so. Pruning actually to a degree creates another problem in dealing with the commons, as the incentive to prune your node grows, this essentially dumps deep historical data into the purview of a subsect of nodes that will increasingly centralize(and have increasingly growing bandwidth demands placed upon them if new users continue bootstrapping nodes) the more other nodes tend to prune. This is no catch all solution, and thinking it is is bat shit crazy. It was a trade off giving an increase in security to individual users now with the future cost of greatly complicating future users from bootstrapping nodes to achieve a comparable level of security. It solved a problem now, and created one we will have to solve later. 


Did you seriously just anthropomorphize a program's code, and then ascribe completely unquestionable honestly to every single one of its users, and use that as a reason to justify not requiring validation of the current chainstate before proceeding to work on defining future chainstates? Are you fucking crazy? 
Wake up, ISPs are **introducing data caps**. They are not offering more for less. **They are price gouging**, not giving free internet to the poor. You are planning for some crazy delusional and imaginary la-la land of a future where somehow the Vulcans stumble across mankind and offer us fancy technology that solves every problem we face, and you are designing Bitcoin to count on that to survive. With all due respect sir, fuck off with that shit. This is a hostile world, and Bitcoin will be designed to survive **that reality**. 
Community nodes? Yes, lets offer all types of previously non-existent geopolitical weakpoints. Conflict arises? Now you can exert economical/cyber attacks previously undreamed off. You could cripple a community by destroying their ability to validate their own wealth, leaving them open and vunerable for months while they bootstrap a new node. You could pull off elaborate scams in tandem with diplomatic maneuvering. That idea is all kinds of stupid. Using your neighbors node because you dont feel like bootstrapping your own is one thing, **having to use your neighbors node** because you **can't** bootstrap your own is an entirely different thing. 
You're "blog" reads like an 8th grade science class essay, and is in no way whatsoever reflective of actual scientific research. **Others may keep a civil tone, but others are done with the duplicitous and deceptive bullshit that is used to push these completely baseless warping of realities that take advantage of people's misconceptions of complex scientific concepts, which are frequently counter-intuitive.**

Think of it like this, Bitcoin right now requires that every node on the network(at least those that are doing more than just relaying/receiving blocks only) receive and hold every transaction for everyone. Thats a very bad design. It has admittedly got us this far, and allowed the network to amass the userbase and amazing level of security it has, but it will not take us to a global level.
Lightning Network will allow *anyone* to be a routing hub. So while yes, there will likely be companies acting as big payment hubs, there will also I think be many networks of small individuals providing channels for smaller level of liquidity. 
Lightning Network is just another protocol built on top of the main blockchain, and using the design of payment channels to build something ontop of Bitcoin that does *not* require everyone to have everyone else's transactions. The main blockchain is something we are stuck with by design, and it is what provides the guarantee of security and decentralization, but by building things like Lightning Network on top, if that becomes the main way people transact it radically alters the costs imposed on the network by people transacting. As long as you already have channels open, the only people who need to see or act on your information are those involved in the transaction. Its really a fundamentally necessary change going forward, but absolutely no single company has any advantage over any other in being a payment hub on Lightning Network. As well Blockstream has stated publicly many times, they have no interest in or intentions of running Lightning Network nodes.

Yes, it(lightning network) absolutely does solve that problem. **YOU** are the one imposing shit on people, a change preventing huge numbers from validating the chain. I am not imposing shit. I am telling you to go fuck yourself when **YOU** impose on me demanding my node bare an insane operational cost so you can "scale" and "let Bitcoin fly free" to get rich. Say it with me: **IF YOU CAN'T VALIDATE THE CHAIN, IT IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENT THAN PAYPAL.** If you want a new Paypal, fuck off, go talk to a venture capitalist and get a loan, and start a fucking company. Your bullshit coffee transaction **does not need to be in the blockchain, or wasting space on MY node**. It can be done in other, **more efficient** ways. 


You are a fucking moron. Finito, end of discussion. Now I have to figure out how to make you less fucking stupid. 
Decentralization = MORE PEOPLE VALIDATING THE CHAIN. More people validating the chain = HARDER TO CHANGE CONSENSUS RULES. Harder to change consensus rules = THE ECONOMICS, SUCH AS THE FINITE CAP, ARE SAFER.

False. Socialism is the **government** being owners of the work place. What you are discussing is a *subsect* or *specialized narrow for of socialism*, not socialism in the general form. 


That also is a ridiculous line of thought, you can do that with **resources**. Salt. Rice. Cattle. Blah blah blah. 
 &gt; For another, the Bitcoin community itself is quite toxic. Rampant misogyny, out-and-out privilege-blindness, Just World Hypothesis bullshit, patronizing and racist "charity" and "benevolent globalization" ideals, and just old-fashioned insecurity and bad-faith arguments in defense of fragile egos are everywhere in Bitcoin-related communities online, which I believe are a reflection of the extremely privileged demographics that are its mainstay.
This right here, is the biggest thing I take issue with. Most of your post I find very interesting and from a fresh perspective, but I feel like the perspective here is totally warped. Misogyny, don't see that here either. What I do see is women getting angry that, coming here without a technical specialization(although there a quite a few intelligent and technical women in this space, and if you notice, they usually don't catch shit except from real fringe nuts), and getting mad that people attempt to correct misconceptions they have. "Privilege blindness" I assume you mean people arguing for specific courses of action for scaling? There are 3 kinds of people there, 1) those advocating cautious research and prioritizing maintaining bitcoins decentralization, its main value, above all else, 2) those who misunderstand that this is the sole thing that gives it value, advocating for reckless "scaling" methods in the belief people will flood in and they will profit through their holdings, 3) those who through manipulative means or because of a refusal to accept they are wrong, think we should act recklessly to increase throughput by any means, completely dismissing decentralization as anything to do with its value, and dismissing any of the huge examples of how the losses of decentralization we've already suffered have impacted the ecosystem. 
The only "toxic" element of this community in that regard are those who threw caution out the window, and recklessly advocate anything they think will just magically made the whole world want bitcoin, because they get rich if that happens. They fail to appreciate most people don't want bitcoin right now, and if they did any serious level of demand would be too much for the infrastructure to handle and maintain any semblance of decentralization. 
I found most of your post actually very interesting and from a unique point of view I don't frequently see, but I think that last paragraph I quoted here was completely out of touch. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:30:49
Do you seriously not see what a deluded entitled prat you look like? You are literally screaming and whining about "being marginalized" or "sidelined" or "disenfranchised" **WHILE YOU HAND WAIVE AND DECIDE ENTIRE COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE NO ACCESS TO BITCOIN, BECAUSE YOU THINK DOING THIS WILL GET YOU RICH QUICK.** That alone is so indicative of a poisonous and wretched person its sad. 
All nodes are not equal, but all of them have weight, and collectively many individual nodes **can add up to hold as much influence as exchanges and businesses**. You are whining that you are disenfranchised, but summarily decide that whole nations of people are to not even be given that chance, and we should just for all practical purposes completely rip out the security mechanism **that ensures they have that chance**. 
*We* **cannot** *have both very large blocks and high decentralization*. You are essentially saying we can go both up and down at the same time. You refuse to define decentralization in implication or declaration, you simply offer it up as a buzzword to try and go "Hey guys, do what I want, it doesn't change anything at all, I wouldn't lie." 


Then whats the rush broseph? Or are you just completely full of shit? If thats really how you feel, then stop advocating retarded actions, and **let it grow naturally**. An article and a  wikipedia entry do not magically mean the people your desired actions would completely disenfranchise and lock out of being able to self-validate all of a sudden aren't locked out or disenfranchised. The style of debate you engage in is like a junior high students, you Google the first thing you can find that "proves your point" and that all of a sudden makes you infallibly right, regardless of the truth of, proof backing it up, or overall quality of your source. A Google search, and repeated statements you cannot back up with lines of reasoning and evidence, a wise man make you not.

Thats not relevant. What is relevant is using **your choice** to force it on others arguing away that your choice is safe enough, so everyone should just settle for it. **Other people don't want to make your choice**. When you argue that because you're okay with it, crank up the block size, you are making choices for other people. You are denying other people an actual choice.
Bitcoin is supposed to be **trustless**. To be trustless, you need to validate the whole chain. I don't care if you choose to not validate it and trust others, I don't want to. You are essentially saying "I trust people, so that should be good enough for everyone else using Bitcoin who doesn't want to trust anyone. Why should we consider their ability to validate themselves when I just want to trust people?" 
SPV as Satoshi described is impossible as of now, **because there is no way for that node warning you to prove its the one telling the truth.** I don't care if you wanna be stupid and trust others to keep your money safe, I don't. *Don't lie to other people about the levels of security they get from SPV, you are giving people bad information when they have a choice to make.*

That is dead wrong. The entirety of all nodes enforcing segwit would fork that off, and when the rest of the miners continued building without that block, all un-upgraded nodes word reorg to that chain *as it is the longer valid chain*.

1) There is no official social media. 2) Opposing views were not driven out, Toomim himself presented research on the effect of blocksize on the network and presented them after getting involved in a client intent on raising the blocksize. He did factual research, and he presented it. 
You seem to expect anyone to just be able to present anything. I could do a half hour presentation on variance, and possible outcomes based on hypothetical transactions and hypothetical variance levels, and hypothesize about how this could affect users and blah blah blah. 1) Doesn't change variance at all, thats kind of just math. 2) Doesn't actually present any useful information. 3) Does not actually present a solution. I could very easily make that presentation, it would be based on math, involve Bitcoin, not twist facts. But it has no place at something like Scaling Bitcoin because it adds nothing of value to *solving the problems*. 
Raising the blocksize is not a solution to anything, it is a changing of a variable that affects the entire incentive balance of the network. That doesn't help scaling, it radically alters the nature of the network to facilitate throughput at all costs, while ignoring all the other variables. Validation costs, SPV security, level of trust involved in the whole system, ability to be resilient and censorship resistant. That is not a solution. That is going "All problems plaguing Bitcoin aren't problems except the blocksize, lets fix Bitcoin(thats you trying to pretend that BItcoin's problems = blocksize)!!"

Yeah you do you twat, a softfork first requires 1) a mining majority, and 2) a node majority enforcing it. To violate the rules a majority of the network is enforcing, is to fork off with miners and nodes who won't enforce those, **onto a separate blockchain**.

Dude, you're seriously a fucking idiot. Nodes, are people with money. You know Bitcoins. The things worth dollars that pay miners bills. Now, if most people with Bitcoins(nodes) tell miners "Fuck you, we are ignoring you're blocks." That miners money is worthless. Every coinbase they make that is ignored is zero dollars. The chain all the nodes say is real, is the real one, its the one worth money. All the previous existing coins on that forked network are worthless, because if listed on an exchange as an independent, most people, being the group ignoring the miners and with the majority of coins on both chains, will dump the fork coin into nothing. Miners very much care what the majority of nodes think. Without the other nodes, that money they make isn't worth jackass. Without the other nodes, its like me writing stuff in a spreadsheet and telling the rest of the world those numbers are money.

What does "emergent tech" even mean? Things just solve themselves? You fail to grasp the only difference between Bitcoin and its competitors is everyone can validate and everyone can enforce consensus themselves. 
The less people that are capable of validating, the less that differentiates Bitcoin at all from its competitors. You walk down that road and you turn Bitcoin into a ponzi scheme instead of the world changing technology it could be. 
You again are so disingenuous here. "I'm being vague cause there's no concrete answers." Same sentence: "Buzzwords buzzwords buzzwords No problems here people, move along, everything in a flood fill peer to peer network intended to scale to global population inherently scales all fine and dandy just by itself in complete defiance to physics and math.

Wrong. Not has been dropping, that was a one time gain in efficiency. The idea is not to gain ground, and then immediately do stupid shit and lose ground. That is not how progress it made. The chain will keep growing forever, the means the validation costs keep growing forever, the idea is to bring those costs down in time to keep up with growth. Not gain efficiencies then immediately negate them. 
The idea that most users running Lite clients is safe is false, and a bad idea to encourage.

@_date: 2016-10-15 08:30:13
No it is not working as described in the paper. To work as described in the paper, you would have to prove that things do not exist. Right now all "SPV" does is get fed a block, and if the TX is in it, it assumes its good. It completely trusts the nodes it connects to they are not lying, the block is valid, and the transaction in it is valid.
It does not validate that coin back to its coinbase creation, it does not check the UTXO set to make sure no coins have been illegally created, and there is absolutely no way for it to self-validate to prove anything is invalid except to fully validate the entire blockchain. There is no independent verification of anything going on here, just trusting full nodes you use to be honest.

What do you not get here? This leaves block size completely in miners hands, with **zero** recourse non-mining nodes can take to stop them. The only reason miners are not in total control of consensus is non-mining nodes validating what they produce.
This long term completely fucks the incentive structure by placing control in miners hands *with zero defense against sybil attacks*.
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:51:01
No one who is contributing anything productive does want to talk about it. And in the grand scheme of things, its not important, and is also the one thing standing in the way of all the other scaling issues blowing up before they are solved.

Yes it does leave it completely in miners hands. The reason thing stand as I described is because the costs of running a node in terms of block by block demand **is fixed**. When all of a sudden miners can drive that up, you have lost sybil resistance. When one person can spin up a bunch of nodes and vote for bigger blocks, they can manipulate miners inability to ascertain which nodes are represented by money and upon forking them off have removed their ability to act as a check against miners.

Yeah they do have voting power, its called orphan miners blocks. When all the nodes securing all the money on the network see miners break rules, they orphan the blocks and the miners don't make money. 
1) It would only take a few GBs. 2) Its not as simple as 10 minute block periods genius. Everything has to get validated when you boot up from scratch. Costs add up forever. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:28:06
Well, guess what, you signed up under false impressions. That is not the essence of Bitcoin, and not what most others want. I don't have to trust miners as long as there are enough nodes running to secure money that miners have to walk in lockstep with them, or all their mining revenue is worthless when those nodes orphan blocks they mint against the consensus rules. I intend to keep it that way. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:09:54


Dude, you are more intelligent than this. That is complete and utter horseshit. That is by no means a guarantee at all. Transactions result in a reduction as opposed to a creation of UTXOs all the time. This is completely disingenuous.
The "adversial" case of SegWit allows the network to push up to the edges of the network's ability to handle *with signature data*. If your memory has ran off here, most of the nice privacy/fungibility involve much bigger signatures. This allows these features to 1) be tested and optimized easily, 2) does not impose the extra data on non-upgraded nodes, 3) allows these things to happen without affecting the dynamic of the blockspace/fees in a huge way because these ginormous signatures are now something eating up space in a block preventing other transactions from getting included. In otherwords, it allows privacy features to be tested without their use both pushing up their own cost, as well as the cost of more standard transactions in the block. 
SegWit coins are not at risk unless a big chunk of the unupgraded network either replaces the the POW and forks off, or captures a minority of the current miners and forks off. The end result here is that the network forks off into two directions, one Segwit, one not, and to boot would have incompatible transaction types **off the bat** so that replay would not be an issue. Essentially, your claim of **risk** is essentially pointing out that this could result in a network split. A hardfork pretty much guarantees that, a softfork for segwit gives a reconciliation period where the network is not bifurcated, and if users not upgraded **really don't want to stay** they can fork off. The softfork option goes much smoother, and all parties are aware of the risks/choose their actions willingly in a much more naturally coordinated way.
You are much more intelligent than you have been acting going off on these anti-SegWit rants. Your concerns are unfounded, and the alternatives you proposed are fucked, mostly derived from other people's work, and introduce way more compatibility problems than "upgrade as you want and you'll see a benefit when you do".

You have demonstrated multiple times in the past year that you struggle to even grasp how simple bits of code in bitcoin function and interconnect.
**You are a joke, go away and stop trying to fuck up something you are too stupid to contribute to.**

You are falling into the assumptions Moores law will continue forever no matter what the future is here. Not a guarantee. You keep trivializing the fact that decisions made now affect the validation costs in perpetuity.

No, I am discussing the issues crystal clearly. You are acting like an idiot. **Reread what I just said.**

No, you're just too stupid to grasp the underlying concepts. If a hashing power starts mining invalid Segwit blocks, **they are hardforking away**. You have to hardfork, to undo Segwit. How do you not get that?

I just think you're an idiot with language comprehension problems. That was a very clear, very concise explanation. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 11:20:59
No, he just did it.
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:16:48
You are also...stupid...

Sharding doesn't lower validation costs, it undermines validating. And frictionless transacting. And potentially censorship resistance.

It was Satoshi's own idea.

Read me post history. You are being ridiculous. Every single thing that killerstorm said is totally workable, and is an implementation detail. Not protocol detail. 
Bitcoin programs using the protocol could do everything he said and still 100% be the Bitcoin protocol, bitcoin nodes, and do everything clients now do. Just alot more efficiently.

Tomtomtom: You have absolutely *zero* guarantee that consensus rules are being obeyed, just that a POW hash checks, and a TX is in the merkle root. What do you not get about that being highly insecure and unstable if that is simply how it is, vast majority using "SPV" and a tiny minority fully validating? 
**That tiny minority in combination with miners is in complete control of what consensus rules are**. In otherwords, that transaction might be not be valid under the ruleset you want to participate under. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:14:36
You...are stupid...
@_date: 2016-10-16 17:20:37
Dude...there is no collective "node". There is *your* node. And *other* nodes. When *your* node gets knocked offline, now you can't validate. What do you not get about that?
The health of the network is the aggregate health of the individual, the health of the individual node can *easily* be compromised by profit driven miner behavior.

OH NOEZ. STOP OTHER PEOPLE FROM VOICING THEIR OPINIONS!!! THE LAND OF FREEDOM DEMANDS CENSORSHIP FOR ALL DIFFERENT VIEWS!! NOEEZZ!!! OUR VIEW CAN'T WIN WITH OTHER VIEWZ TO CHOOSE!!!! AAAH!!!
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:48:21
No, I think you are the one who doesn't understand. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:26:13
You are just wrong. And miners would(this is not me alleging, this is a fact) have the incentive to make bigger blocks than non-mining node could handle *because they make* **money**. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:13:59
....dude...you are nuts. The **only** thing that matters about your node is that at some point in time, it has fully validated the blockchain, thats it. If I validate the entire blockchain, build my UTXO set, and then throw out everything except til last week, **I am still fully validating**. 
Everything he said was 100% technically accurate, the only discussion here is whether you think people will stop storing the chain, and we will fall into a tragedy of the commons issue, if its super easy to do so. Saying nodes that do that aren't full nodes is totally irrelevant, and wrong. People can do that even if its not made easy by default.
