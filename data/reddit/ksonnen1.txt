sure its very manipulated just as anything else in life.. you can play along with it as well...
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:26:35
practical use of bitcoin would be using it in a decentralized manner without envolving the centralized banking system. if the manipulation wears off perhaps that could be acheived.

15%of the total drove the price to 20k? i find that a little hard to believe but i cant say you are wrong..
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:11:21
I dont need to guess your bitcoin wealth. i really could careless and a little tip.. i have had my own bitcoin since early 2012 
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:32:12

@_date: 2018-05-30 16:13:18
The company he founded he sold when he knew virus protection was not working anymore and irrelevant.. 7 billion he sold it for.. yep hes bat shit crazy... his crazy ass will laugh to the grave.. also he supports crypto to the fullest so thats a good thing because a lot of people do listen to him and and GREAT exposure for the entire market.. leave the old guy alone hes far done more then im assuming you ever will and have you are chasing the bitcoin dream most likely.!!
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:19:06
I would agree.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:22:58

if everyone just bought and held and nobody traded tell me what would drive the price up?
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:28:01
Bingo...i think that might be the plan do whats Good for bitcoin and seems ALTS doing nothing about whats happening.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:40:34
You made a very good point.! Seems this kinds of stuff happens more often and when things tend to happen more often it ends up becoming the Normal and we don't want that in this area...
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:00:54
Normally they have reason when they do things such as this. in this case it makes you wonder where the goverment got their information. I feel for you people
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:08:52
that tactic has been done in 2017.. needs a new one
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:34:42
Soon enough all the Big holders of bitcoin will milk this enough to have all the coins split up among the elite crowd then they can trade one another with something that has only power trip value. I would assume you want others to buy in and stay in but its not seeming that way anymore
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:30:06
then play along with it and make some more btc.... how is this annoying.. been doing it for a year 
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:42:05
None over 10.00 USD... I dont know what the future holds for crypto, id like to think i do... been into this good hot mess for many years ..I can say my first 500 BTC was cheap and the few years after i thought i threw the money away..Today i think very different.. I guess the opinion of bitcoin all has to do with when you got in and what you got out of it. Me personally it was a smart move and game changer my initial investment that got me going. I have not put any fiat into this market in many years and i wont ever again. Not a reason to at this point i used btc for large purchases which it was intended and i had cashed enough out ..if it all went to ZERO i personally can still never complain..still smile actually..If the market does return again there will be many more who will think exactly the same i'm sure..
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:03:12
Seems bitcoin plays this routine few more months it will bleed all Alts to basically nothing. master plan maybe?
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:13:32
powerwagon  installed full carli suspension already and a procharger on the way. it's a beast of a truck
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:15:44
Jan 2018 i purchased a new jeep rubicon and a dodge ram power wagon..both 100% with bitcoin and fully loaded...i think that was friendly enough for me and since i was an early bitcoin investor im still smiling hard.. In and out of the dealership in record breaking time as well...
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:45:47
Blame yourself and not coinbase... it has all its conditions on their site...nobody reads then complains...you are using their service ...
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:52:42
I'm starting to think Bitcoin never really corrects its a very manipulated orchestrated coin. it's initial intentions of what it was supposed to be got twisted in a not so good way. hopefully it will get turned around back on track on its initial course and be used and a alternative payment system if not it will just be a turn over and profit coin. i will add i myself use it as a profit making coin because if you dont you lose out. so im no better at making it back to what its intended to be used as.
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:33:05
Hes not wrong im thinking he will be used as an example..usa is good as that to keep things in check.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:08:54
sell 9200 rebuy 8600 sell 9600 rebuy 8600 play the game too..it's bitcoin after all the most volatile coin with the most influence i dont see a problem at all.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:51:36
Need some new money in this market.. bleeding the alts from the 2017 wont last forever. this is a new market for sure. 2017 any coin seems to make a profit 2018 seems all profits are being takens away..bitcoin cashouts...then squeeze more from alts cash out more all thats happening in my view
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:14:20
A month is forever in this market . I dont know if i could get paid monthly
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:36:42
Since there isnt new money in bitcoin at the moment its bleeding the alts little by little the past 3 months ..the die hard alt holders eventually sell and there a little more bitcoin to be sucked up and this tend will continue until alts are fiat paired large bitcoin holders know this and using this game well.. this is my personal opinion at this moment.

He didn't deserve the punishment he was handed. I don't believe the story about hiring an FBI to kill anyone. they had him pegged to the wall when they got him with what he actually did. Also dosent the Our own goverment hire throw away killers and have people killed all the time? 
Ross did wrong Yes but he was also used as an example that was his biggest misfortune in his life sadley.
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:46:09
I'm sure if you could you would... enough hating people and their market tactics...Most everyone is in BTC for fast easy money you actually think people are using it for the reasons it was intended? Yes you seen me type it correct ALMOST everoyne that has bitcoin is trying to Bank off of it..! Most that are bitter bought bitcoin after the 5k mark.. anyone beforehand is still good..

@_date: 2018-07-27 15:29:41
I like BTC but yes its exactly what sec talks about.. Just like when sec said No it dropped on its face last nite.. you would think to bring more adoption to btc people would try to help it be more stabil but we keep seeing thats not the case and thats a terrible sign 
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:38:58
Goes to show you what people think of the real value of btc when something dosent go their way.. DROP...  they want sec approval dont get it and they show the biggest problem the votality.. makes sense right?  shakes head
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:49:04

@_date: 2018-04-10 13:55:23
This was one of my first actual large purchase with 100% bitcoin in jan 2018.
It felt good using bitcoin for what it was intended for. 2018 ram power wagon new at a dealership they used bitpay service ..The easiest purchase of a vehicle ever.
I will say it was bought with all profit from bitcoin as well.!

BTC doesnt need ETF's for its survival.. right now the news of ETF is just being used against BTC...Play along
