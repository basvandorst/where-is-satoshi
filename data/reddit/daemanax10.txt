Bitcoin is just digital cash.
Whatever uses there are of normal cash, bitcoin can do. No more, no less.
So greeks could use it or not. It has nothing to do with evading taxes anymore than they can evade with normal cash.

Try too. 
Imo, bitcoin is an asset just like dollar, yen, euro, gold, oil, stocks etc.
Diversification is always a good idea in any portfolio. So experts will never ask you to buy only stocks. They will say keep some money in bonds too, just in case.
So there is no yes/no answer to "should I buy bitcoin". 
Or, there is, cause its not a bad idea to diversify, and the answer is yes, you should buy a bit for 2-5 years term.
But the tougher question is:how much?

There is a basic truth about money/trading: publicly known information is pretty much worthless. 
Cause everyone knows that difficult will increase/decrease/remain same, so they have already factored in the possible price changes. 
Almost nothing that is a factual information is usable to predict any price movement.
Only advantage is if you are some sort of expert, or investor like Warren Buffet, who can look into public info and find hidden value. Its called value investing, and warren buffet will tell you to not invest in bitcoin because he will find it unpredictable.

Look up into darvas boxes. 
As long as you buy any asset when its moving upward, you're good. 
And sell when its sliding. 
By that logic, bitcoin is buy today. 
Don't know any investing forum.
