If the keys were deleted, they would be unable to prove their involvement and the others in the group could easily deny it. Stuxnet was a large military project with high publicity and no names have ever appeared on it.

It's PHP but not as we know it. They have such good people that they built a better PHP compiler (HipHop) to speed things up.

I'm out of my element on this, but yes it is a VM. Open source project; you can Google PHP HipHop and find more on it.

So does that mean that each wallet and its public key are already registered on the network? Like if Y gives 0.1 to Z, Z must have a reference to know what Y's signature is.
Edit: for clarity

This inspired me to ask my landlady if she was considering Bitcoin! Not sure how it'll turn out.

I have a decent understanding of how public and private keys work in regular crypto. I get that mining Bitcoin is about finding a match and that it's easy for others to verify and award coins.
Now suppose I give 0.1 Bitcoin to someone. At this point the original mining match isn't important anymore; it is about verifying transactions using the blockchain. But how does the value transfer to the recipient wallet in a way that only they can spend it? Does the receiving wallet need to tell the network something like "don't accept transactions unless I sign them like this" ? Or does every wallet already have a known public key?

I was at a Chicago tech meetup where high school students presented a community map that they'd made. Later I was helping them debug something on their site, I mentioned Bitcoin, and right away they're asking when I bought in, if I'd bought anything with it, etc. They knew exactly what it was.

Didn't we go through something similar to this, with Gavin Andresen lending credibility to Craig Wright early on? The keys clear up everything, because no one can study or fraud their way to duplicating the keys.
