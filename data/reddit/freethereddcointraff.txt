No it's not pegged to Bitcoin. Read the whitepaper.

Most people do not care about not wanting to pay taxes?
I think you are mistaken.

This doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
The human-dogs most of the G8 countries are surrounding their borders these days is disgusting.
I refuse to enter the USA any longer due to fear of persecution.
I was literally harassed by USA border agents for 2 years because I answered one of their questions incorrectly.
The question?


I was taken aback, only because I had:
a) never been arrested in my life or had ever even been accused of being arrested
b) I had crossed into the USA probably 100+ times with my friends and family in the last 20 years and had never heard of anybody being asked if they were arrested before
My answer was "uhhhh, no".
At which point the border agent handed me a piece of paper and then it all went to shit from there.
I was sent to a room and kept in solitary confinement until they found the time to come and talk to me.
They harassed me about my job (and who the hell I thought I was taking a friday off to visit the USA) to no end.
They harassed my girlfriend and dog as well, just for being with me.
They continued to harass me for 2 years after this ordeal (in 2011) every time I entered the USA, at which point I decided "fuck it, the USA isn't worth my degradation" and I have never been back since.
I really wonder what they're so afraid of everybody for to be honest... because a few people have been killed from terrorists I imagine is their reasoning, but what about the thousands they themselves have killed in other countries while at war?
Ahhhhhh, I could write about this forever.
Fuck the world powers and their hate-mongering border guards!
