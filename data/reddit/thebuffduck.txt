Hi, fellow young Bitcoiner here.
I personally used Purse.io to start. You get fucked on the rates, which are 20% higher than market price at least, but it is an easy way. I remember a few months ago buying Bitcoin from there @ $319 per coin. (Note: Not that it was a sale or anything, just dreaming about those cheap Bitcoin prices)
Now I use LibertyX. This is an easy and fairly safe way, but still a tad sketchy. Those cell phone stores and loan/payday cash places on the wrong side of the rail-road tracks, yeah those, that's where you buy them. 
But other than that it's fine, just transacting with a cashier.
The LocalBitcoins option wouldn't be the best in my opinion. Still getting fucked by the rates (at least where I am) and you may be a bit vulnerable, but assuming your about 14 or so it wouldn't be to bad. Just meet at a very public location (busy coffee shop) and if your feeling a little nervous bring your friend or your brother. Highly doubt in that case that it would be any more dangerous than any other part of our everyday life.
Good Luck!

Probably $0.10 USD worth of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:59:29
I think you're asking in the wrong place as this doesn't seem to be related to Bitcoin.

Not sure, but i would recommend the faucet  They payout about 750 satoshis an hour last time I checked. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:40:34
Sounds good, thanks for your help!

Cool pillow, here is another cool one.

I'd Donate it.
Wikileaks and Pirate bay like other redditors said are good options. But Wikipedia, Tor, Devs, and Edward Snowden would also be good causes to throw a nickel at.

Sorry, I can't read the article so based on basic extortion here is how it works.
Demand that they be paid in some form (Goods, Cash or in this case Bitcoin) or there store and property or them or both will be damaged or hurt. 
Now let's look at it from a business owners perspective. And see why it would work.
Option 1
Pay Ransom (Let's say 500 USD a month but I'm not sure how much the article says he demands.) And they, if they hold their word, won't do anything.
Option 2
 Don't pay. Now the people extorting you said that if you refuse to pay them they will bomb (or burn down or loot. (medium of destruction doesn't matter.) If your business is destroyed, it will take weeks or months to build it back up. With all the business you would lose it would have been in that case easier to just pay. But then other times they don't do anything because the people extorting don't want to more numerous reasons.


Easier said than done. Would you really want to confront a guy with a weapon (gun, knife) while you as a business owner have maybe a rod? And seriously risk your life.
So maybe that kinda explained why someone would chose 1.

With wesellcrypto.com they got crypto to me instantly.
They recently added BTC and I've only order Doge from them. The Doge got here instantly so I don't see why it would be different, they also advertise instant too.

Okay, I'm quite unfamiliar with much more than the basics of the Bitcoin wallet. So I don't totally get what you are saying because of my lack of knowledge. So would you mind going a little more in depth? Thanks.
1. Okay Bitcoin Shutdown
2. Have Done That Already. 1 Copy on the Computer and 2 others on 2 separate flash drives. 
3. This is where I started getting confused. How do I copy a dat file over another one.
4. Also confused about how to launch bitcoin from the command line. 
Thanks again for your help.

It came back as an unrecognized search pattern. Any ideas?
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:53:42
Wow. This was actually really easy. Thanks for the recommendation, love the layout. Now general question, How long does it take for Bitcoins to get to my wallet from a wallet that sent them. Thanks

@_date: 2015-04-20 22:43:52
If we find anyone, we should have them do a r/bitcoin AMA!
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:13:26
You have no idea what could happen, Bitcoin could go to $100 tomorrow. Telling all of your friends and family to invest thousands of dollars into something they don't know about, and don't understand is outrageous. What if Bitcoin went to $100 tomorrow and your friends and family lost thousands of dollars. 
That would definitely mean some ruined relationships
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:40:19
It still makes zero sense as to why they would do that. Of all people why would the U.S. burn a couple hundred k on giving some Random people mining a currency they don't like money?
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:33:58
Regardless, your evaluation of 1 BTC = 1 Billion will never come true, unless the dollar suffers from hyper inflation sometime in the near future.
By that evaluation, 5 BTC, at 1 Billion each, would be equal to the entire current BTC Marketcap

Oh, :I Thanks

For the average person, this could be pretty difficult.
You go to paypal, throw in your information, and you are ready to send money.
When people start seeing long lists of characters, or you start trying to explain the system behind it, it leaves them confused. 
There are uses with Bitcoin for the average first world citizen, but right now, the average citizen sees it as a lot less of a hassle to send money over paypal. 
They also don't see places where they could spend it, this is for the same reason, business owners see it as too complicated. Having people swipe a card is a lot easier to them in the short term then having to setup accounts and worry about that. But they also don't do it because at the moment there are not a ton of people buying things with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:30:54
It would be ironically be cheaper to physically drive the money to the recipient.  
@_date: 2015-10-04 05:44:05
Thanks for your help
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:08:20
Nothing farther from the truth.
@_date: 2015-10-04 05:55:49
Sounds good. Thanks for your help. Could you comment your Address and I send you some Satoshis for your help?
@_date: 2015-10-03 04:23:40
Fuck. Amerifag here. Completely forgot about the water and thought it was the equivalent of Belgium to France (i.e. Just a land border) So I'll just row there with my money instead!
Just trying to get my point across about how ridiculous this is. Kinda like how Bell charges $5 per mb for roaming data. So if you were to stream a 1GB movie, you could fly from NY, buy the movie, stay in a hotel for a few day, buy tshirts and fly back for cheaper. 
Just insane how that works, but thanks to innovation, we have Bitcoin to force money transfers to innovate. That is the beautiful thing about capitalism, competition forces others to innovate.

By retire early I don't think he was saying that you could just drop your life and not ever have to worry about finances again just because you own some Bitcoin. I believe by earlier he just meant before the time you would normally retire, I guess he was saying around a year early.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:43:25
Okay, transaction just went through. And I didn't realize there was a new client, thank for updating me. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:20:27
It is a gambling site too. If you would have read my full description you would have noticed that.
@_date: 2015-10-04 05:47:16
Okay, so it says it is not a double spend.
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:19:46
Hey, I have one more question.
Will I be able to send payments to that address, or any address, and the money going through and being added to my account after this? Thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:04:39
It would never become that. If it did, all the Bitcoin combined would be worth 2.1e+16
2.1e+16 = Too big for Google calculator to fit in it and to lazy for me to look up how much that would equal.
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:33:33
Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:26:47
Not sure why that is. They were really helpful though and responded quickly. Here is their email they contacted me with.  fbtc12

Yes, I believe Bitcoin will disrupt finance.
Bitcoin could easily eliminate Western Union Money Transfers.
Bitcoin could bank the unbanked in third world countries.


Tons of people in third world countries have mobile phones. If a simple, intuitive Bitcoin mobile wallet app was developed and distributed/advertised, this would be a revolutionary change in the world of banking, which affects world economics, which is what keeps the world spinning.
If you have hundreds of millions of people that did not have a bank before, or have been getting fucked over by their bank, this would completely change world economics. Giving remote African farmers the option to do business with people all over the world is possible though Bitcoin.
TD;LR: Bitcoin has the potential to completely alter the world as we know it.
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:29:03
Oh, so how is this attack happening? And why would developers at places not immediately recognize that unconfirmed transaction ids may change? 
And sorry if I am a complete noob or asking the same question, but is this an attack perpetrated by somebody, or is it a flaw in the system? And what is causing it?
Thanks again for all your help!

So, how do I add calculate a, "proper" fee when sending money from Bitcoin core? Thanks

So, I just want to make sure I am understanding this correctly, and your opinions seem logical, and like mine. This should be a relatively obvious thing that is happening, so why hasn't it been fixed. 
One other question though, is this happening to a lot of people? Thanks again
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:37:24
Not really. It's dipped below 200 but has been stabilized around 230-240 range for a while and it is picking back up to the high 240s and early 250s.
