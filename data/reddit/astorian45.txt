Why are you fucking dumping ?

Thank you so much for taking the time to explain.

Yeah I spiced it up with some personal doubts about cryptocurrencies and their real value. But about the stock market.. let me see here.. just a second, ah! here it is: 
Please tell me what do you think it's the best option in times like this? It's a humble question. My intention was to say hold and don't scare potential investors.

New to day trade here, I would like to understand why after a big drop of about 200.00, what most people would probably consider to be a great opportunity to buy, I keep seeing these sell walls. It's a humble question. I don't see any bad news today. I usually use as reference the volume trade and cryptocurrency news. Are there other sources I should be keeping my eyes on besides these ones I mentioned?

Funny. But my point was, this is a crucial time, to many bad news, nothing good. Big sell offs and potential investors moving away from this, money that would increase the value. Going with the flow now and sell, to me is just doing the opposite to make this work.

I'm relatively new to this, but it seems that what's killing bitcoin are the daily traders.

Jesus dude. I said I don't doubt it, I didn't affirm it really happened for that reason. I'm saying there is a possibility of them anticipating a big problem that a potential threat like bitcoin could cause. It's dots man.. dots and people are trying to connect them.

I've changed my strategy from hodling to trading but making sure I keep the same numbers of bitcoin regardless if it goes up or down. I consider it my investment and I'm working on in to get it back and at the end, I still want to have the same numbers of bitcoins. But when I see these sudden prices changes, the pumps and dumps, created by either pump and dump groups, whales or even exchanges, I think to myself, I'm on a ridiculously manipulative market which main product doesn't generate anything... what the fuck am I doing?

1% owns 99% of bitcoins, they dictate and control the market. Bitcoin continues to get hit by a non stop wave of bad news, in my opinion, created by people associated with the bank industry and stock market. Google and Facebook are probably concerned about their own stocks after the stock market plunged and I don't doubt that the fact they banned bitcoin ads has something to do with that. Do I really understand how buying a coin helps the technology behind it if it's already created and ready to be used? NO. Do I believe it has benefits? I want to. Now.. if you want the technology to survive and thrive so the value goes up. Don't try to milk every dollar. Hold. Because you are killing bitcoin.

damn this market is so manipulative

what's your blog? I'm interested in your expertise.

Thanks, for instance, I now see a 128 sell wall now, which will probably disappear. What's the intent when they put specifically on the sell order book? Are they trying to make people buy so their 128 bitcoins get filled and as result another big dump therefore creating another buying opportunity? Or..I'm trying to understand how would the intimidation help drive the price up from that point..

good point
