Consider getting your coins from somewhere that doesn't snoop into your business. I recommend bitsquare.io, or your closest bitcoin ATM or even localbitcoins.com

Bitcoin ATMs are legal in the US, I know of no mechanism or law in place that could illegalize Bitcoin ATMs. Outlawing Bitcoin ATMs would not be an effective way to fight the growth of Bitcoin anyway, which would be the original point of outlawing the ATMs in the first place.

Every time you reuse an address, you're building a history for thst address. This generally makes it easier for someone to make the connection between you, your address, and the addresses you sent coins to. 
Plenty of wallets provide rotating addresses. On iOS, Arcbit allows you to create as many addresses as you wish, and allows you to delete or create them as you wish. Other apps, Breadwallet for example, is specifically designed without the capability to rotate or change your address by will, although the app will change the address automatically (either after every transaction or after every 5 or so, I don't remember which)

Then if your wallet address changes, how do you propose to track anything down? Many users myself included use multiple wallets- I've used maybe 10-15 address in the last month alone. My main wallet app generates a new address for every single transaction. In a world of available anonymity, why would you not take advantage of that opportunity? I think cycling addresses is an intrinsic part of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:54:56
Local bitcoins is legit. Large transactions are done professionally- in a public place, no shady stuff, just show up, pay the fiat, get your coin. Don't part ways until several confirmations roll through - that is something any half-decent seller on localbitcoins already understands.
Just choose a well respected seller, someone with a good reputation. The only realistic issue might be the closest such person being far from your location.

Check out Breadwallet, Mycelium, Arcbit or Airbitz. These are all mobile apps

If you plan on paying tax on your Bitcoin, exchanges are fine. Exchanges cooperate with governments meaning your Bitcoin history is privy to the tax collection entity in your country.
I forgot to also mention Bitsquare.io. It's also a p2p exchange. 
Let me reiterate that mobile wallets are totally safe. So far, I have not heard a single experience in which someone lost their funds due to a flaw in the mobile platform. 
I believe Trezor is the best option available right now. It is a hardware wallet- every review I have seen has been positive. It's around $100 USD I believe.

Never, ever keep your coins on an exchange. Buy on Coinbase, but then you absolutely must transfer the coins to a wallet only you control. Something like Breadwallet, Mycelium, Trezor, Arcbit. There are many options, this is such an important thing, but frequently people ask on this subreddit how to recover their coins when the third party that held them vanishes.

I recommend avoiding Coinbase. Check out coinatmradar.com to find Bitcoin ATMs near you. Check out localbitcoins.com for local peer to peer offers. 
Never keep your coin in an online wallet. There is a plethora of safer options- Trezor, Mycelium, Breadwallet, the list is long.
People here may tell you that using a phone application as your main wallet is just as bad as any other option. For disclosure, Ive kept all my coin in Breadwallet since it came out and I have yet to have a problem

I recommend avoiding Coinbase on general principle... Considering all the shady tactics they are known to have used, or even suspected of using... I don't gamble with my money, that's why I feel comfortable paying a huge markup at BATMs because then at least I KNOW my transfer isn't going to be arbitrarily blocked. 
No disrespect to Coinbase. I was happy with their service until the Feds started tightening up on them. Wish them luck in the IRS fight. Peace.

If you are moving small amounts of money and plan on paying tax on your BTC, Coinbase is fine.
Problems start happening consistently when you are moving a couple hundred USD per week. Suddenly- questions are being asked, funds (in some cases whole accounts) are being frozen with no warning, the site just happens to shut down at peak trading times....
I've used Coinbase since literally the second day they were open for business. I have never had an issue with Coinbase, but I'll be damned if I stick around to turn into another Coinbase Casualty. I appreciate what they've done up to this point, but I no longer feel at all comfortable using their services. 
Use Coinbase at your own risk.
