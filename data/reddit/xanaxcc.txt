As someone who makes a living in this space the us retail presence is extremely low, Asian retail is more much impactful and State side the scene is pretty much all OTC.
As for whale manipulation that is mostly a meme,  if you reach out and start getting some connections with popular OTC exchanges like kraken and huobi, who have desks in multiple locations worldwide. I think it would open ur eyes to how little retail presence there is. If you think the average Joe Shmoe is buying BTC with layered bids totaling 100 each, and cares about the yuan devaluation you should think again.

Retail? This run up from 3k has had very little retail presence, not sure where you’re getting that from.

You can’t separate them? The ecosystem is not united different regions have lead in volume and influence throughout the history of this space.  OTC trades ARE registered, you cannot be anonymous and go through an exchange lmao. Almost every major exchanges sends out daily OTC emails about the volume across the day. And ofc as I said it’s different in every region whether it’s Asians leading the selling in the am, and EU leading the buying later that day. 
I’m not arguing that Bakkt isn’t good for long term, it is. But to say the space is huge retail is simple not true, at least of Bitcoin. 
If you wish to continue this discussion I’ll even send a few of the latest kraken otc reports, just get to me on twitter :).

You prob think derivatives and futures have no effect on spot prices either ����

Ok it’s very clear you don’t actually trade this market, OTC does matter and has an effect on he underlying price. I don’t need to read an article to understand what I’m doing, I talk to many people daily and have been doing this for years. Have a good one bro, read up.

nope, stocks are de-listed on the regular for lying to investors.  This is pretty much the exact same situation, nothing out of normal really. Plus this is an extreme situation and the first of its kind.
