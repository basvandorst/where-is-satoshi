How is this not a bigger deal?

This may be the first time a DCG pre-news tweet has kinda lived up to the hype...congrats!
@_date: 2016-04-15 20:32:04
This is correct.  We've gone over this, and some people are going to use this, blow off taxes, and end up with huge fine/penalties/jail time etc as a result.

We had this conversation ad nuaseum back in 2013, but nothing ever materialized.  Funny you mention it though, because just today I was thinking this would be a good time to revisit the conversation...
Probably has something to do about LTC going up considering it has absolutely no utility and less security than the other two CB coins...

It doesn't matter.  If you put five bitcoin into Coinbase at 100, and then you sell five bitcoins at 500 one year and one day later, you must pay the 15% capital gains on the 1,600 profit.  If you buy at different times and cash out at different within and outside of a year, this becomes a total f'ing nightmare.

Good luck.  And I'm not being sarcastic.  Seriously, good luck to whomever is the first one to get a major audit over this and please post how it turns out.  I'd love to be able to deposit into Coinbase and use the shift card with only approximating capital gains.

I'm also interested in this answer.  This is the  reason I hesitate to request one, but tbh I haven't looked into it that much.

Can someone smarter than I explain what - if anything - this means for bitcoin?

Topic posted already, but here is the Wired article that just came out
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:53:35
Cashing from Coinbase to your bank is a taxable event, and the IRS can claim these records any time they want.  This is why I do not understand how using the Shift card is possible without it being a tax night.  
It becomes particularly messy if some of your spendatures are from gains considered long-term capital gains and some are considered short-term capital gains.
Am I missing anything?
@_date: 2015-12-12 01:18:44
It doesn't matter.  That's not how the IRS works in the US.  They treat Coinbase like a bank, but a bank that only holds property.  
You send them dollars.  If those dollars grow by 100%, you owe 28 percent capital gains on the profit, regardless of whether or not those dollars are every converted to bitcoin.  There have been countless posts on this and this has been confirmed by tax professionals over and over.

Nice! We are worth a little less than 1/17th of a Trump.
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:03:04
This is absolutely incorrect

I upvoted this.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:20:11
woot woot!
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:57:04
I'm always a little skeptical when I see these type of posts, but this was much more impressive than I expected it to be.  
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:02:15
Exactly - I think it's irresponsible for Coinbase to not be crystal clear with this.  The IRS is going to have a field day over the next few years as people scramble to try to prove why they can't pay tax on bitcoins move from CB to another wallet/exchange/cold storage. 
Edit:  How does providing a fact get a downvote.  If I'm not correct please correct me

I think he's talking about btc's overall market share...?  It's dropped 10% over the last week or so.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:01:08
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:17:14
Great.  Still shut out in my state.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:32:45
My (wild) guess:
If you are planning on approving:
- You want to wait until the last possible week to maximize decision time.
- You want to wait until Friday to try to bury the story a bit.
- You want to wait until the banks are closed to discourage an immediate bubble from forming.
If you are planning on denying, I think you give them a chance to withdraw a few days before.

Not really.  527 current users vs. 188.  I'm not in a specific camp, just sayin
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:40:41
IMO I'll take another coin where the developers aren't complete dicks and risk any potential loss in gains.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:08:28
OK, but how?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:35:13
This is pretty much the kind of crap the Monero developers have been doing all along.  It's beyond me why anyone would invest in these clowns.

If he wanted to prove his identity he could just do it - this isn't rocket science.  This is someone desperately trying to reclaim their 15 minutes.
