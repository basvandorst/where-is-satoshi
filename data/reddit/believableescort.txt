Don't believe the PR team, it's the same reason their logo is so very noticeable on their devices and no other company's is - they also claim they don;t focus on marketing, but it's just done very differently to most tech co's, word of mouth is the main feature built into the product so the userbase can only talk positively about their feel of the product and ecosystem.

Maybe so, but they just don't want you to understand your real options, just to know that their ecosystem is always going to be associated with easy to understand ways of doing positive things, anything under the sun that doesn't fit that description is out - torrents included.

I think you underestimate how influential they are, they are breeding a bunch pseudo-tech followers who demand a tiny learning curve to get their immediate gratifications. 
They value usability and market share and will never let a customer learn non-intuitive, tedious behaviours on their device if they can avoid it. On top of the obvious curtain to control digital good consumption and the risk of the bitcoin donation for media model, If customers were to wise up to new uncontrolled ways of doing things being worth the harder learning curve apple loses customers.

TBH they are doing you a favour educating you about the power of existing ideology in the best way possible, next thing you know you'll be quoting the twilight zone and labelled an extremist.
