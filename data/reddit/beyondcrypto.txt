 I believe, these are the points one should keep in mind before settling for a cryptocurrency trading platform.
**The Fees**  – One of the most important things a trader should look for are the  trading fees. Understanding the fee structure is extremely vital as it  is a major component of the profit/loss calculation. Typically crypto  exchanges take a small fee (around 0.5%) on each trade. Most of them  also charge withdrawal and deposit fees. Be vigilant when checking the  fee terms so that you can avoid any nasty surprises.
**The Variety**  – The second most important point of difference is the variety of coins  an exchange offers. If you want to take advantage of price spikes and  dumps you want to be able to access a large variety of financial  instruments. Some exchanges offer only a few coins, while others have  well over a hundred to choose from.
**The Interface**  – User-friendliness is another aspect that should be taken into account  when picking a exchange to trade on. You want something sleek and fast  to work on instead of dealing with unnecessary front-end bugs.
**The Security**  – If you are going to store liquid funds for trading online, you want  to make sure they are safe &amp; secure right? The security of an  exchange platform is extremely important and you should always make sure  that you are using a legitimate, trusted and reputable vendor.
Based on these 4 factors I recommend checking out:
* [eToro](  eToro is a social trading platform where you can invest and trade  stocks aswell as cryptocurrencies. You can also use their CopyTrader  system to follow leading investors and make trades based on their  actions. EToro is one of the safest places to get bitcoin online, and  the process is very fast and convenient.
* [Bittrex](  With well over 190 coins to choose from, Bittrex is the number one  crypto exchange to go and trade coins. Based in Seattle, Washington the  platform has seen tremedous growth ever since it’s inception in 2013.  The platform offers moderate fees (0.5% per trade) and does and a great  chart application which makes it a great choice for experienced and new  speculators.
* [Binance](  Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, this exchange has dominated the  market with the short time frame of a year. Don’t let the Chinese  location fool you – this exchange is available for investors and traders  all over the world. With 0.25% fee per trade binance is also officially  the cheapest platform to trade on.

I'm pretty sure everyone has asked this question at some point, because coinbase really isn't the way to go unless you're totally new to the game. High fees? Lengthty verification process? Unresponsive support? No, thanks. There are some really good alternatives out there and I've listed the best ones (in my opinion) here. Please do check it out and find and exchange you will actually love here: [
