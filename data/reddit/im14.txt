Heh, who would've thought that Mtgox would slowly begin to fade out of relevance and BTC-e become the reference exchange. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 03:27:05
Explanation: These are physical bitcoins worth 1 BTC (yellow) and 5 BTC (silver). The private key allowing access to the wallet is inside the coin. They're made by [Casascius]( and these are 2012 issue.
The address holding 5 BTC coin's value is [1CsMRHBTdGVsYRFAZjmdoKAFo68qzWMNFZ](
When I purchased them (for 1.17 BTC and 5.17 BTC, respectively), their USD value was $47 and $235. Today we saw an exchange rate jump to $52, so their value is now $52 and $260.
There's no utility to them other than the coolness factor, ability to gift to someone, and collector value.
My opinion: They're absolutely gorgeous and symbolic, have a nice heavy feel, and it's just really cool to be able to hold physical bitcoins in hand. It's "holy shit, I'm holding a string of 1's and 0's that's worth over $300 in my hand, and I need _nothing_ else but that string to redeem the value."

Sure, I'm increasing awareness of when I tip, but I'm also giving away coins and increasing awareness in the concept of cryptocurrency. If by giving away coins I can get more people to participate and tip, great!
If you think I'm benefiting from this personally in any way.. I'm not. I've tipped close to $500 so far, and put in endless dev hours to get this up and running and give people option to tip in any cryptocurrency they wish. If you think that since I wrote ALTcointip, I'm the only one who can run it - the code is open-source, anyone can set up a bot in minutes.
I'm doing this because I like what ALTcointip stands for - openness, choice (of cryptocurrency), no fees or "premium" features, ability to run your own coin tip bot. bitcointip doesn't provide any of this, so to say that ALTcointip doesn't add anything to Reddit is plain wrong.
Naturally, I don't want to have go unnoticed and fall into disuse. What I don't get is rotten behavior every time I post a tip (even if it's a Bitcoin tip). I just get plain downvoted, all because the bot has 3 letters in its name... "alt".
So much for the principles that Bitcoin actually stands for. I hope can become the open-minded community that it promotes.

The "trades per second" number for Mtgox that I've seen thrown around is 30-60. This is still nothing compared to the "big boys" out there - for example, I found the number for Nasdaq in 2008 was 250,000.

Thanks for taking your time to respond. Wow, this is big news for the world of cryptocurrencies! I wish you great success!
I have a few questions, if I may:
1. You're probably the first exchange on which I see the XRP symbol. Do you have any relation with Ripple and/or plan to integrate with it in some way?
2. Regarding relationship w/banks: One of the advantages Mtgox was touting when it announced partnership with Coinbase is faster deposits and withdrawals due to Coinbase's closer relationship with US banks. How about Kraken? I've noticed ACH, Wire, SEPA, and Dwolla as accepted deposit methods, but all these take many days to go through. It would be great to see a deposit method that takes hours (cash, Chase Quickpay, etc). Bitinstant is great but not the 4% fee, and I've heard a few horror stories about money stuck in limbo.
3. Are you planning to support other cryptocurrencies in the future (LTC, PPC, etc)?

Uh, all ripples (XRP) are pre-mined and are to be given away over time. There is NO mining of ripples to be done. Their purpose is NOT to serve as currency, but rather as exchange tokens to facilitate trust and prevent individuals from spamming the network with transactions.
See 










You guys seriously know nothing about them yet criticize it - sounds familiar doesn't it?
And about password storage - ripple wallet is a browser-based client. Every program on earth stores user-supplied password IN MEMORY on the client which is what's happening here. _Because_ the wallet is web based, you actually have a piece of mind by seeing exactly what the code does.
On the server side password isn't stored in plain text, but of course who bothers to read ripple protocol spec? Let's just start the finger pointing.  **Just like Bitcoin network can't spend your wallet's funds without your private key that's not stored in the network, ripple network can't spend your funds without access to your password that's not stored in the network. Losing ripple password = funds are forever lost.**
Besides, ripple isn't out of _alpha_ yet - very few people use it for anything other than testing / learning the system.
You guys sound like old folks who are scared about bitcoin for one silly reason or other.

Current Bitcoin network hash rate (currently at 35,000 GH/s = 35 TH/s):

Here's how you are wrong. Go look at the total volume during the $100-$250 buy-in, and compare it to the volume of post-$250 selloff. The selloff volume (and the buy-in volume after that) are _significantly_ higher than the initial buy-in. This means that the panic sellers have already cashed out, and perhaps even bought back in at the lower prices.

I get what you're saying, but yes, everyone simply accepts it for what it is. While in ideal world donations and advertising wouldn't be tied to one another, we definitely don't live in one. It's up to each individual to have the diligence in determining whether they'd want to do business with someone. You seem to adhere to certain a set of principles more so than majority of people here, and that's why you don't seem to get through to most.
I'm indifferent to what means someone uses to advertise their business, as long the means don't cause unjust hardship to someone. In this case the advertising method used has a good side effect of feeding homeless.

Technically, nobody is stopping anybody from buying / selling Ripples for any price they like - it just doesn't make sense to do so. Ripples will not be used for payments, and Opencoin, which holds on to all pre-generated Ripples, can begin releasing them at any rate at any moment.

Let's say by the time you get your Jalapeno, the network's hash rate has doubled from 35 TH/s to 70 TH/s (a fair assumption as ASICs become commonplace). Jalapeno's cost is $200 and its promised hash rate is 0.0045 TH/s. According to the [ROI calculator]( from [this thread]( you will be making on average of 0.23 BTC/day. Assuming $/BTC stays around $50, you will earn back your investment of $200 in about 18 days.

Hopefully I won't get downvoted for this, but I'd like to bring JerryMoran's awareness to the fact that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is thriving with many cryptocoins. While Bitcoin is definitely the undisputable leader in market acceptance, capitalization, and network strength, there are some viable alt-coins that may be better suited for specific use cases.
For example, Litecoin: +$5 litecoins
Alt-coins like [Litecoin (LTC)]( and [Peercoin (PPC)]( weren't made to compete with Bitcoin as their objective, but rather complement it as well as strengthen overall trust in cryptocurrency.

Here's my question. Not trying to sound inflammatory or start a coin war, but:
Why do so many Bitcoin users hate alt coins (Litecoin, PPCoin, etc) and Ripple? It seems that the attitude they have towards them is the same attitude non-Bitcoiners have towards Bitcoin (i.e., "it's junk", "there's no added value", "it's a ponzi scheme", "it will kill Bitcoin", etc). 
As far as I'm concerned, innovation and competition is good. There are 100s of Linux distros, each good at its own thing, why not 100s of coin networks, if there are enough users interested? 
And Ripple - people tend to think it's some kind of scam organization trying to sell them XRPs while in fact it's very far from truth. They're the most innovative application of crypto currency concepts to date, but in this Reddit 90% of the time I see baseless accusations flying around and any positive comments about Ripple get downvoted quickly.
I have no affiliation with any of the above.. Just a Dev/SysAdmin guy doing my part contributing.
Just my 2 cents, and thanks for your time!

This is one piece everyone considering ordering ASICs today seem to be missing. Yes, today a bitcoin costs $50. A year from now it's projected to rise 2x, 3x, maybe even 10x, who knows?
This is why so many people dropped out while mining bitcoins was easy even with a CPU - they weren't worth much. Same people are biting their nails now, wishing they'd kept mining and held on to those coins.
As for me, I've ordered 90 GHash worth $2000 in February. Even if it arrives in July and network hash rate is 500 TH/s, and I only make 0.5 BTC/day, that'll still be worth it if I hold on to those bitcoins for a year or two.

XRP is de-centralized, but nobody really gets it. Just think of P2P torrent technology - there are trackers, that anyone can run, without which torrents can't function as well. Ripple gateways are just that, and according to Ripple, anyone will be able to run one when they're good and ready.
The fact that there are gateways seems to throw people off, but everyone running around screaming how Ripple is scam because it's centralized and closed-source when in fact the developers have long said anyone can run a gateway and source code will be made available is saddening.
So, let me ask you one question: describe a potential "shit hits the fan" scenario that can occur with Ripple technology that can't occur with Bitcoin, and we can talk then.

It's actually _very_ easy for a lot of ASICs to go offline. Majority use the few _very popular_ mining pools, so a good DDOS attack on the top 2-3 pools will bring the whole Bitcoin network to a screeching halt.
If you remember the blockchain fork from Spring 2013, it was pool owners who developers had to work with for resolution, since pool owners control the majority of hash rate.

I don't think anybody's denying that volatility is a problem. However, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself - it's a product of speculative investment in light of recent explosion of interest. 20,000 new users on Mtgox every day is not a joke - everyone wants a piece of the pie but panics the moment price dips.


So what? Next week or next month those losses will be erased by the continued growth.
Just look at the chart from exactly one year ago - Bitcoin was doing nothing more than steadily growing. Everyone were happily buying drugs and going about their business without worrying about volatility.

It's true that _some_ alt-coins are just copy-cats (fork, change name, change some startup params, and launch), there are a few notable exceptions:
* Litecoins (LTC) - use Scrypt instead of SHA256 as proof-of-work, confirmations are 4 times faster, 4 times as many coins to be released
* Peercoins (PPC) - the only implementation of Proof-of-Stake+Proof-of-Work algorithm, long-term energy efficiency and resilience to 51% attack, quite active development and some really bright developers working on it
* Namecoins (NMC) - a coin dedicated to distributed name resolution system that's meant to replace DNS. In the future domains ending in .bit will resolve through it. If you've known just _how much_ pain DNS is currently causing to computer professionals.. DNS needs some serious re-work.
Personally I'd like for these to succeed, and I'm pretty certain that their success will strengthen Bitcoin more than anything.

I think the growth will be in the lower range. Also, so many factors besides liquidity and popular acceptance affect the price - for example, a major malfunction like 'fork Monday' could send prices down, or acceptance of bitcoins by any government could send it way up. We will just have to wait and see. If history has shown anything, it's that when companies and people get behind an open source project with lots of potential, things can get very interesting.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:20:44
In all seriousness, though - is that a bad assumption to rely on? BTC value has gone up in the past, why wouldn't it continue to do so, especially given its built-in scarcity?
Consider a miner who was mining *at a loss*, at a time when Bitcoins were, say, $2 each. Fast forward to today, the miner now has great return on investment.
Sure, it's a gamble that Bitcoins will go up in value, but if they don't, no matter *what* mining hardware you have, you'll lose. So, might as well assume that Bitcoins will go up in value.
I think it's silly to calculate mining profit given *today's* value of Bitcoin. Just have a worst/best case scenario and hope for the best.

That's actually one thing I like about PayPal - a trusted 3rd party who can handle my private information. This is why I prefer to use Google Checkout, Amazon Payments, etc. when dealing with small merchants. Small businesses don't have the power and expertise to store sensitive data, which is why they choose payment processors like PayPal in the first place.

Just witnessed a cumulative 1,500 BTC bought up by someone at $42 in a second. Looks like people are jumping on the opportunity to get some cheap coins from those who sell. **Exchange-rate is zig-zagging as people buy/sell trying to outsmart the market.**
**Pool update**
See [this thread]( for latest status of which mining pools have downgraded to 0.7. Once 0.7 pools reach critical mass, problem is gone.
Here's a list of big pools:
**These pools confirmed on 0.7 or below:**
* BTC Guild 6500 GH/s
* Bitminter 2000 GH/s
* Bitparking 130 GH/s
* Deepbit 4200 GH/s (on 0.6, so unaffected)
* EMC 1900 GH/s
* Eligius 400 GH/s (on 0.6, so unaffected)
* Ozcoin 900 GH/s  (on 0.6.3, so unaffected)
* Slush's pool 3600 GH/s (0.8 with sipa patch, so unaffected)
TOTAL **19730 GH/s**
**Pools with unknown version (could be 0.7 or 0.8):**
* 50BTC 6000 GH/s
TOTAL **6000 GH/s**
**0.7 and below version pools now have dominant hashing power. This means it's just a matter of hours before 0.7 blockchain catches up and becomes the main blockchain. We're a-okay, guys.**
**Moral of the story: _thank almighty FSM for centralized mining pools_.**
**Trading update**
Looks like value has dipped at **~$36.50** and now rising back up (just passed **$44.80**). I'm predicting it'll stabilize at **$46** by the end of today..
**Last edit: Panic is officially over, Mtgox engine lag down to sub-10 second range (it passed 600 seconds at peak of panic). Looks like price will settle around $45-$47 tonight.**
I think this was a _great_ learning experience for everyone involved. A lot gained, not much lost.

Couple of comments about two-factor auth:
* The two-factor auth setup form gives user a choice between [TOTP]( and [HOTP]( I ended up learning a bit about TOTP vs HOTP and it seems that [HOTP is quite more vulnerable than TOTP - for example, HOTP keys don't change as often]( This _may_ result in some users inadvertently sharing their Google Authenticator keys thinking they're TOTP while they're HOTP. The only advantage of using HOTP is when time can't be synchronized between the server and client (non-issue on smartphones). The bigger immediate issue of having two choices may be the amount of support requests you'll be getting from users asking about the difference.
* When I scan the OTP barcode with Google Authenticator or HDE OTP app, it's automatically named as "Kraken" (or "Kraken secret"). It would be great if it could attach username to this, since apps don't let me pick the naming. So, "username and "username secret", so I can have multiple OTPs stored on one device and differentiate among them.

Aaand here's some proof. I've taken the YTD history of BTC/LTC rate from [here]( and made a quick Excel graph:
I think the significant increase in BTC/LTC rate since February can be attributed to ASIC miners coming online and people switching over to LTC, which increased its perceived value.

Wow, thanks for such quick answer. I guess I'm not the only one awake at 3am.


I hear this opinion a lot from the investor side. I've read a few analysts' opinions and they generally don't see the point of "more types of cryptocoins." I don't know how's your technical knowledge, but there's a lot of enthusiasm in crypto community for the unique features each cryptocoin offers. 
There's also a lot of failed alt-coins out there, which may give the rest a bad name. In fact, just in the past couple of weeks a few new coins have been announced and have picked up steam (for better or worse) - Bytecoin, Feathercoin, CHNCoin, etc. It seems as if everyone's decided to fork a successful coin, make a few tweaks to parameters, and release it as something new.
The important distinction to make among them all is, of course, which cryptocoin actually carries a change that will make it worthwhile long-term, and which is just an attempt to "get in early" from those who wish to pre-mine a lot of cheap coins. I feel that Litecoin and PPCoin are the few contenders which are more or less legitimate in their goals, if only because there are active and intelligent dev teams behind them and they've forked from Bitcoin long before it has turned into the crazy speculative rollercoaster it is today.
Then there's of course merchant acceptance - so far Litecoin has been making inroads (Atlantis, The Pirate Bay, among others) and I've already heard of a shop that accepts PPCoin.
I hope you guys take some time to learn about the alt-coins. Putting immediate gains of speculative trading aside, the alt-coins might be your savior in the case of a sudden issue with Bitcoin blockchain (such as not-so-distant accidental fork) - which is a question of when, not if.
Best wishes to you guys and good luck!

I don't see why this has to be "one or the other" type of discussion. Some countries / demographics / entities may prefer one coin over another for whatever unique characteristic it got. As long as there's established exchange rate between all the alt-coins, there'll be no problem with everyone using whatever currency they find most likable.
Ex: people in Japan are paid in JC (JapanCoin) while people in Vietnam are paid in VC (VietCoin). They can shop on any website world-wide because JC and VC have an established exchange rate with Bitcoin, dollar, or whatever else merchant chooses to accept.

Giving free/easy 'coins to newcomers is arguably the _best_ thing someone holding coins can do. It educates them about Bitcoin, and turns them from observers to users, thus increasing Bitcoin's market cap. In the end, if you're holding coins, you'll get many times your money back by sharing the wealth, since the value of your coins will increase with increased acceptance.

Okay, I got one thing wrong, that roughly one block per hour is found (you're right, it's one block every 10 minutes). 
Then with 10% of network's hash rate present, *on average* one block every 100 minutes will be found, but that number will vary greatly. For example, look at the current [time gap between blocks]( - they're supposed to be spaced by 10 minutes but some blocks are a few minutes apart while others are up to 30 minutes apart and more. With 100-minute blocks, this translates to a huge variance between transaction confirmation times - hours and even days gone by without finding a block. Hardly a well-functioning payment protocol.


Sorry, but I don't think you can call 2, 4, 6-hour transaction confirmation times "function as normal." People care a lot about their transactions being completed in a timely manner.




If the pools are unable to mitigate the DDOS attack, the difficulty will adjust itself in 2016*100 hours = 4.6 moths (!!). I think that's a terrible "inconvenience" to be had in a payment system.
What I'm basically saying is, the way things are now, the centralized pools are a single weakness of Bitcoin protocol that's easy to attack and keep down. Bitcoin protocol doesn't factor that weakness into its computation because it's technically outside of protocol's control, but in fact the mining pools have become a very crucial part of the network.

A lot of the price is pure speculation, and the market is very "thin" (not a lot of cash is available for buying BTC because it's hard to add cash to Mtgox, etc). Therefore, any modest sell-off could trigger a significant price drop. Just look at last month's worth of history.

Well, there still is a centralized piece of Bitcoin infrastructure that will cause significant damage when taken down.
What am I talking about? Mining pools. There's a handful of pools that monopolize a huge portion of network hash rate. If some entity can successfully DDOS them, there'll be a stretch of time ranging from few hours to few days where _no_ transaction can be confirmed (due to difficulty not having adjusted to dropped network hash rate). It all depends on how quickly can the mining pools come back online and/or miners regroup.
If you think majority of miners have backup pools configured, think again. During large pool outages in the past it was clearly shown that most miners (even those with a big chunk of hash rate) don't care enough to set a backup pool or else set it to another server of the same pool.
And no, p2pool as it currently is can't be a solution - it's not been tested to support the tera-hash load the centralized pools are currently handling.
Edit: For those who "don't believe" me, here's source:
"Unknown" and "p2pool" together are 14.6% of network hash rate, while 54.2% of network hash rate is due to just the top 3 pools.

I think the "trust paths" is a pretty cool feature of Ripple. Right now it's a huge pain in the ass to use Bitcoins without trusted escrow service (Silk Road, Mtgox, etc). Ripple allows you to establish entities you trust (family, friends, your bank) and transact with them directly without any additional effort.

I disagree that the people on are *significantly* smarter than your average Redditor. The majority of folks are here because they're holding a few coins and so are enthusiastic about anything Bitcoin-related. This also explains the hostility towards anything non-Bitcoin - just a simple fear that some other cryptocurrency tech will cause their precious 'coins to lose value.
Sure, there are devs and smart people here as well, sometimes, but they're too busy to be refreshing Reddit all day. Those who are not doing anything (and therefore are *not* busy) are the ones you'll see actively participating.

Here's why it would be extremely difficult to time that $35/bitcoin purchase: Let's say once you see that it hit $35 and not moving or rising, you place a purchase order. BUT there's a 600+ second lag at Mtgox due to all the buy/sell orders queued up. This means your order will wait ~10 minutes before getting a chance to be executed, at which time the price might've moved in either direction.

XRPs are used to pay the transaction fee, rather - for the purpose of ensuring nobody is spamming the network with millions of transactions (like SatoshiDice is doing with Bitcoin network).
According to Opencoin, XRP will be given away for free, actually, for the foreseeable future. The reason XRP is hard to come by today is two-fold:
* Ripple _hasn't launched_ yet, so it hasn't begun to give away XRPs to new users
* Ripple [_has_ given away XRPs to early adopters]( but you have to qualify to receive them
Therefore, there's currently a tiny market for buying XRPs, though the exchange rate is ridiculously low (something like 10000 XRPs per Bitcoin). If you can't get XRPs for free and absolutely must have them now, then there's a seller out there who's willing to sell them to you.
The default transaction fee is 10 "drops" or 1/1,000,000 XRPs. This means 1 XRP will let you make 1,000,000 transactions.

Except XRPs were never mined, they were generated instantly, every single one. XRPs were never meant to be used as currency or traded publicly. And don't tell me Opencoin holding on to most XRPs is "not fair" - what the hell does fairness have to do with anything? Surely they need a way to recoup the costs of developing, promoting, and hosting Ripple as well as supporting it long-term?


This trick might work if you're some anon guy on the internet. With Ripple, there's an entire company, with real people who have developed successful and innovative products (E-loan, Edonkey) on board. There's a round of angel investors who've put in real money into Opencoin. You're saying Opencoin's gonna waste their credibility and pump and dump? And then what, turn themselves in to FBI?


Every successful business starts with rationale for huge profits and a passion for the product it's making - just ask Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckeberg, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin. 
Look, if someone's dumb/greedy enough to ~~invest in~~ buy up XRPs hoping for a quick profit - they deserve the burn. Ripple wasn't made for speculators to turn it into a shit-show that Bitcoin is turning into.

Right, the challenge is predicting how much the network hash rate and difficulty will increase by the time you get your order. You also have to factor in BTC/$ exchange rate. Your profit depends on these numbers. Nobody knows the answer, and you'll get many wild-ranging estimates if you ask.
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:29:05
I think the other contributing factor is network speed (and so difficulty) going way up due to all the specialized hardware entering market, making it harder for average Joe to mine coins with just GPUs. Just to think of it, I was unhappy that I couldn't get my ROI fast enough when I mined 15 bitcoins/month a year ago. At today's prices that kind of return would be fantastic, but these days all I would get with my GPUs is stinky 2 bitcoins/month.

It really depends on which rate they buy into. If they buy into now at $65, and it soars to $200 and then crashes to, say, $75, there's still safety. If someone buys at $200 and it hypothetically crashes to $75, that's a problem.
There's a pretty large "safety net" buy wall consisting of those who want to buy-in at a cheap rate. The question is whether there's enough buy orders to stop the price from sliding in an event of sell-off (I think there is).
Looking at the past month, we've had two sell-offs that were immediately stopped by the buy orders, and within 24 hours, the price was back to pre-sell-off.

I have nothing to do with Ripple, just here because the ignorant accusation made by OP is making me sad.


I don't know, OP's ignorance is offensive as fuck so I guess I have a right to be defensive


After reading about Bitcoin protocol in 2009 (heck, even today as a newcomer) you still wouldn't know much either. You can't do 5 minutes or even 1 day worth of reading and suddenly become an all-knowing expert.
Besides, if all you can say about it is "all this crap" then maybe being an early adopter isn't for you, you know. Just wait until someone writes a Youtube tutorial that's suitable for your level :)


Same thing that happens to Bitcoin when DOJ kicks Mtgox door down - nothing. Ripple is an open protocol on which anyone can run a node. Opencoin folks are kick-starting the network but they won't own it after it's up and running.


Ripple is not centralized (and if you think it is, let's see your reasoning) - Opencoin does nothing more than running a few Ripple nodes and developing the software for it. Is World Wide Web centralized? Besides, blanket statements like "All X is Y" isn't going to get you anywhere. PPCoin used central checkpointing until the network hash rate was big enough to prevent attacks. 
I have a feeling that you just read someone somewhere complaining about Ripple and centralization and decided to restate it, which _is_ dumb.

I'm optimistic about future value. Today alone, Mtgox's trading volume at the current price was ~$1,461,115 (30916 BTC volume * $47.28 weighted mean price). That's $million-and-a-half worth bitcoin purchases alone (no volatility today so no panic-buys/sells). Mtgox claims to fulfill 80% of bitcoin trading, but with so many other exchanges now popular, it's may be closer to 50%. So, my estimate is that there was around $3,000,000 of bitcoin _trade_ today. I know that's very little compared to what big-boy markets do, but compared to last year, or just a few months ago, this is huge.

For comparison, I've been mining litecoins for a few weeks now using my Radeon 7950 and 7970 and I average 1200 MH/s which translates into about 15 Litecoins/day. There was a spike in litecoin's network hash speed recently which sent difficulty way up, but now I'm hoping it will go back down - I used to be able to mine 20 Litecoins/day with just one 7950. 1 litecoins is worth about 50 cents at the moment.

I'm sorry, but the market and the math are not going to support your statement. With 5 GH worth of graphic cards, I can either make $10/week mining Bitcoin, or $65/week mining Litecoin. Alt-coins are valued by the market, not by some exclusive group of "utterly defeated people who are unwilling to admit something." The valuation is not some imaginary theoretical number - you can sell a Litecoin today for about $2.
The funny thing about alt-coins is - your attitude towards them is the same attitude people (and you!) had towards Bitcoin when it was priced in pennies. Of course, today you think Bitcoin is the Holy Coin and the rest are Unworthy, even though a few alt-coins have dedicated dev teams behind them and are diverging in their development.
Your shortsightedness and fear of change is going to cause you to bite your own tongue again a few years later, when you'll be regretting missing yet another train.

I think LTC's USD value is derived from BTC/LTC rate, *not* LTC's BTC value is derived from LTC/USD rate - since there's not much use for LTC outside of trading it for BTC at the moment.

Um, adding Litecoin to Mtgox will allow for said passing of Bitcoin assets through altcoin...




Hahaha. Wonder why latest Bitcoin chain fork bug wasn't caught in testnet? Because replicating a "production" environment in "test" has always been a huge struggle, and this fork is a great example of it.


There's USD, EUR, and JPY support on Mtgox, why not BTC, LTC, PPC, etc support? Competition has never been a bad thing, it will only strengthen each coin. What adding altcoins to Mtgox allows is their equal representation to the newcomers and general public.

I just think there's plenty of buyers who have acquired coins low (in $20's and $30's) and are looking to cash some of them out at $49 or $50, which is why we're seeing this pay wall stopping the price from going any higher. If demand for Bitcoin grows (and it _does_) and it becomes easier to get money into Mtgox and other exchanges (and it _will_), demand will outgrow supply and price will move past $50.

Nobody's *bitcoins* are at risk. *Speculators' dollars* are at risk as people buy/sell trying to outsmart the market, but that risk is an inseparable part of trading.
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:56:09
Here's a little observation that may make you quick 'coin without any arbitrage:
Every morning there's an influx of Bitcoin purchases on Mtgox as users on the east-coast wake up, find the USD in their accounts confirmed, and spend it. This makes the price of Bitcoin jump, so you sell. A few hours later the price goes back down a bit and stabilizes, so you buy.
If I did this today, I'd easily be 20 BTC richer now, but I chickened out and decided to hold on to 'coins for now.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:43:52
My story:
I originally bought in just a short month ago - bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoins at $47.5/coin.
Since then I tried my hand at day trading on Mtgox and decided it's not worth it (too stressful and too risky).
Instead, I invested just _some_ of coins in alternate cryptocurrencies - namely, Litecoins and PPCoins.
I won't go into discussion on which currency is good or bad - for the matters of investing I only care about its trading potential and conversion rate to Bitcoin.
As you can see, growth of Bitcoin/Litecoin and Bitcoin/PPCoin rates allowed me to make 35 Bitcoins in a month without really doing much (other than putting my faith in these alternative currencies). As these currencies are finally being traded more widely, their worth increases and so does my investment.
Think about it, and go study the movement of rates over the past few months - you can't go wrong investing 1, 3, 5 Bitcoins into one of these. It's risky, yes, but so was me dumping $10,000 into Bitcoins a month ago.
You could say that I'm just trying to get people to buy alternate currencies so I benefit - well, not really. I will benefit if more people buy Litecoins or PPCoins, but my 10-bitcoin investment in these alternative currencies isn't really much to spend effort about.
If you really _are_ upset about missing early adopter opportunity with Bitcoins, think again - *now is an opportunity to be an early Litecoin, PPCoin (or some other coin) adopter - don't miss it again by dismissing it without doing some research first.*

I feel your pain bro! I bought in at the last peak, at $47.5, and literally _one hour later_ the price was down to $35. I had the biggest urge to sell but didn't, and gradually the price was catching back up to what I bought them for - until this happened.
If your coins were still sitting in Mtgox, you could've done what most did - sell immediately, wait for price to drop, then buy. At the moment of this writing, though, the panic is over, and price is back up to $46.

Well, you either have to carry large quantities of cash around, and risk losing it, or rely on electronic methods of payment, and risk being caught and have that as evidence against you. With Bitcoin, you can pay electronically without the risk of it being used as evidence - which is why we have Silk Road and government is now concerned that Bitcoin can be used as a money laundering device.

Well, BFL are the only ones (pre)selling at the moment. Avalon have all their pre-orders sold out, and they also charge more $/GHash. If you do have money laying around you don't need, then pre-order from BFL now, but keep in mind that there's no guarantee that you'll get your return on investment. It all depends on when you get your order, how much 'coins you'll be able to generate, and what will the price of those 'coins be at that time.
The reason I have faith in BFL is because they publish weekly updates with pictures of hardware, office, etc. and are more careful about providing shipment date estimates (learned from mistakes). Besides, even if by the time I receive my BFL order and all I can make is measly 0.5 BTC/day, I can still hold on to these coins for as long as I want until they're expensive enough for me to sell/use.
The counter-argument to the reasoning above is - why not just buy bitcoins with that money and hold on to them? To me, it's not as fun, though :)

Let's estimate how much hash rate will be added by BFL fulfilling all of its current orders. BFL has about 18000 orders, let's average each at 10 GH/s, then we get 180 TH/s. Let's estimate that Avalon also adds 180 TH/h to the network, and private projects another 40 TH/s - we get a total of 400 TH/s added.

What you said doesn't contradict anything I've said. If Ripple takes off and Opencoin decides to sell their XRPs in the future to make profit they deserve, it doesn't magically change what XRPs are used for - protocol is protocol. 
Developing and promoting something like Ripple costs money, time, and lots of resources. You're saying they should develop Ripple and not benefit a single bit from it? I think that'd happen in communist Russia but not in capitalist economy.

Demand isn't linear either, it's accelerating :) There's a _lot_ more people who don't use Bitcoin than those who do.

Besides the trendline, if you do cost averaging, you're a trading a _lot_ safer than all of the panicked noobs. So, do it :)

You can top off with bitcoins, sell them, and buy back when they hit low price. These news are pretty fresh, I'm sure there'll be tons of scared speculators selling, driving price way down.
Edit: oh, wait. Bitcoin deposits to Mtgox are suspended. Doh.

You know, it's not too late to load up on some alt-coins, just in case. A lot of them are either cheap, or worth almost nothing, so there's not much to lose but a lot to gain. Here, have a weird coin. +upvote bbq
EDIT: It isn't even about whether you "believe in" any of the alt-coins - I just think it's smart to diversify. The attitude towards alt-coins today is exact attitude that was towards Bitcoin 2 years ago - and it's been valued at $1,000 now.

I had a similar experience, sold at $44 and bought at $42, then watched in horror as the price went down to $35. Luckily I resisted urge to sell (knowing full well that the problem is very close to being remediated). I have the trust in bitcoin protocol and its devs (as well as pool operators, now) but I have no trust in speculators, which is why I was worried sick.

10% of network going doesn't equal one block every 100 minutes.
So you don't understand the basic relationship between difficulty and network hash rate. Difficulty is calculated from network hash rate so that given current hash rate, roughly one block per hour can be found. Difficulty in Bitcoin [adjusts every 2016 blocks]( This means that any significant drop in network hash rate will result in _no_ blocks being found for a long while since the difficulty is too high (until it adjusts). No blocks found = no transactions can be confirmed.
All in all, any significant drops in network hash rate = disaster.

Sit back, relax, and let the bitcoin community do its thing, of course!

You're gonna be surprised but [Digg is pretty good these days]( They just went through a big redesign and it's a very pleasurable front-page to read. Without all the circlejerk and stupid memes and "omg look at my dog" and "omg look at my brother who's dying from cancer tomorrow".

Heh, those clowns over at bitcointalk.org who are bashing Ripple all day? Haven't heard a single good argument from them, just a bunch of FUD on how the evil corporate decentralized Ripple is set to destroy poor little Bitcoin. I'm sorry, but that's not "the community" - those are the same folks who raised a ton of FUD over the improvement in transaction fees in latest Bitcoin client release, whining on how evil Bitcoin developers are set to destroy Bitcoin. Those "intellectually challenged", to say it in politically correct way, are the toxins that waste everyone time on trivial crap, finger pointing, and other useless drama.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:27:50
Transaction fee can and will be adjusted so there will never be no ripples left for transactions.

I traded LTC through BTC-E and PPC through Bitparking PPC Exchange. Never had an issue with either exchange.

Good point - we need to show businesses that support Bitcoin that we got their back. Buying.

If you're on Mac or Linux, you can symlink to your wallet file. If you're on Windows, I feel bad for you.

Someone already posted an open source bot here before. However, the big issue is getting currency into BTC-E is very difficult and costs fees.

Let's extend these numbers to mining litecoins. 2,600 MHash/s in bitcoins = 2,600 kHash/s in litecoins. According to  today you would be able to mine about 12.7 litecoins every 24 hours, which translates to **$41.30/day**. A lot more profitable. 
Besides, litecoin's value is about to rise even further when Mtgox begins trading it. _Besides_, there are no ASICs to compete with.
For 7970 Radeon HDs, use Reaper v13beta4 with settings for 7000-series cards (they're different from 6000-series and 5000-series cards). I mine my litecoins on notroll.in litecoin pool. Use stratum mining proxy to avoid doing longpoll-style mining (resulting in a lot less stales).
The ONLY concern is that litecoin's Scrypt mining protocol requires 1.5 GB of RAM per 7970 graphics card (which is why litecoin mining is known as ASIC-proof), but memory is cheap.

Yes, you can buy LTC with currency on BTC-e if you want but it's not easy to get currency into BTC-e.
