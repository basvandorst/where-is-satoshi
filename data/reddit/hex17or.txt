Bitstamp has no withdrawal fees, accepts SEPA deposits. Highly recommended.

Nice. Just remember that this is a custodial wallet so keep that in mind before putting in larger amounts of sats.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin!

If you don't have any public channel opened then it may not show up on 1ml.com.

Just imagine what needed to be done if one wanted to read a book, watch a movie, book a ticket, buy stuff, pay bills, attend a class to learn something etc. We can do ALL of this online thanks to the Internet when just two decades back, this wasn't the case. Hopefully Bitcoin will achieve something similarly radical in the coming years - most importantly in a decentralised fashion.

Just a note: this is a custodial wallet. Should be fine to play around with small amounts though.

It should appear if you have at least one non private channel opened.

Price is dependant on a lot of factors. With the halvening around the corner (next year), expect some moves after that.

Bitcoin will do to value what the Internet did to information.
