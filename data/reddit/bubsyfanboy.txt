Mostly the fault of parents for not teaching them to stay away from loans.
As for the impact on Bitcoin, I doubt it will have much of an impact, other than a few more frozen assets.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:11:18
Probably stabilize
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:00:04
Actually, no. Wait till my birthday hits.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:17:33
Very good to see that. Greeting from Poland.
PS. Shame a good chunk of people think it's a Ponzi scheme
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:58:39
Might need another tombstone in the future
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:55:05
They could've sold oranges and make it match colour-wise
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:47:11
Isn't it true for all currencies?
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:16:15
The banks would think you have a massive bank-killer.
The only later they realize your bag is empty, because you don't really need physical Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:03:48
Bitcoin chips sound tasty
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:06:47
I'd give you Platinum for this, but I have no coins.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:43:33
What did she do? I'm out of the loop.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:16:19
Phew. I'll have to do it quick
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:05:06
Oh, so she's corrupt.
Alright. That says it all.
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:25:48
@_date: 2019-11-30 06:17:04
Note: if it keeps rising, it will call eventually.
Last time BTC had a crash, /biz/ was basically full of pink Wojaks.
@_date: 2019-08-10 09:56:41
We can only thank the Federal Reserve for that.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:52:04
Nah, we need BTC in constant circulation. If we do that, the worth will even further and more stores might try accepting it.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:56:51
That's nice of you, Portugal.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:06:01
I wonder if they'll ever play Skillet
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:32:56
It's Poland. It's not that economically restricted, in fact they used to encourage such solutions. They only later realized "wait, this crypto thing is literally an escape route from out beuraucracy" and tried taxing it, forcing you to pay $500,000 for gaining 15,000 dollars from crypto. Luckily, thanks to protests, they backed down, but that didn't stop the government-run media from calling crypto a risky Ponzi scheme a'la Amber Gold.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:27:44
I hope
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:14:52
I still haven't invested. When should I?
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:20:50
_b-but Bitcoin is dead!_
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:14:55
I was born too late. :-(
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:30:35
That is amazing. I'll try to make a crypto account ASAP.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:13:30
Yeah, but they wanted to tax ANY gains and even tax you **for losses.**
@_date: 2019-06-06 04:50:14
Welcome to the daily life of Bitcoin owners.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:31:24
I'm getting more and more depressed from me not having any crypto and my parents mocking my attempts to venture there.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:31:37
Meh. It'll bounce back in a second.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:40:15
Aight. 
Here's a funny story: my gov actually tried and is still trying to tax crypto!
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:55:28
Me not having any crypto yet is a tragedy
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:37:34
Phew! Maybe I didn't lose too much from not investing yet
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:25:11
Where tf is PLN
@_date: 2019-12-31 10:12:27
A lot went down in BTC's first 10 years. Makes you wonder what will happen in the next 10.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:18:35
I'm not
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:17:22
Hm. Maybe once the currency goes down, maybe not as badly as last year.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:50:46
Phew! I haven't lost too much yet. Hope that remains till I finally invest in BTC
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:17:55
That looks dangerous
@_date: 2019-12-29 11:01:11
These things are rare, but their existence pleases me.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:37:25
It's the very first results you lazy bum
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:05:21
Am I the only one here who is just looking at this waiting for the perfect moment to invest?
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:47:53
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:58:59
I learnt it off YouTube and DuckDuckGo.
@_date: 2019-12-27 18:24:45
Imagine if the currency was seashell instead.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:13:42
Reason TV always kills it with the parodies.
@_date: 2019-04-13 11:54:36
Lazy bastards couldn't even keep the same quality of the edited text when they made that fake TV screenshot.
Also, got a porn ad when I tried to exit back to Reddit. Had to open a new tab, because it was unskippable. Great.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:10:08
I wonder what could happen if Nero tried to make a BTC account...
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:07:01
"Savage, but I ain't talking bank account"
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:28:09
After loads of falling, we finally got the gold.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:39:58
Ahh, what's a non-English nation writing in English without misspelling basic words?
@_date: 2019-04-14 14:59:13
@_date: 2019-04-06 11:55:35
Why is there no Bitcoin fursona or anime chick?
EDIT: Spoke too soon. Found both on Google Images.
@_date: 2019-04-15 07:26:31
I'll try to with my parents. I'm just afraid that at least one of them thinks it's a pyramid/Ponzi scheme a'la Amber Gold.
@_date: 2019-04-21 19:29:16
And it's not just BTC!
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:27:14
You predicted the $1,000 rise in USD worth. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:06:47
B-marked currency bad
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:08:06
After a while, certainly. No currency spikes up infinitely without some kind of correction later on. That being said, **_WOOHOO! BTC IS BACK, BABY!_**
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:48:25
What a shame.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:37:01
I meant the Caffe.
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:03:16
Yeah, but they didn't invent it.
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:54:01
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:10:43
You can DM us. We can't downvote you there.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:31:58
They're shooting themselves in the foot if you asked me, but I'll take it.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:44:46
Oh, NVM then
@_date: 2019-04-13 11:39:36
Mine is that Bitcoin is indeed very valuable, but because the crypto wave had a lot of people just holding on to their money instead of using it to actually buy anything, the value is limited for now. In order for crypto to pernamently take off as the dominant style of currency, we'd need serious education for newcommers to realize that these things cost a lot only when everyone actively trades with them.
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:10:11
Whenever gov tries to tax you for crypto
Also, that scene was actually pretty funny
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:36:41
Oh look, it's the memelord himself.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:37:11
And I still haven't invested in crypto. Oof.
