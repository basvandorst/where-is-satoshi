It's not identifiable enough.
being anonymous means no safety, so Joe Average won't go near it. We need the option to have it tied to IRL identity like a bank account. You can always have 2 accounts; one of them anonymous and unprotected.

I doubt that really matters. I presume there's people who repeatedly take from bitcoin fountains without paying back by spreading the knowledge of bitcoin - are they a serious problem? Where the fountain is designed to get advertising impressions, those 'parasites' are still doing that part of the job well enough even though they aren't helping the 'political cause' part of the job.

Is it feasible that someone like Google or the govt could use  quantum computers to dominate the system? If so is there a defence against this, like switching to a different kind of cryptography, and could that be done before it was too late to save the system?

If that happens I'm not sure even gold would help you much. Just food, labour, land and other essentials
