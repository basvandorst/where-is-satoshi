I like the cut of your jib there sir. 
Yes I don't know many people who can't boot of off a USB and open a wallet.
If they can't I'd say they should probably find out, or leave crypto alone - and at the least they should not set themselves up as a knowledgeable preceptor to a friend on how to invest and secure thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:32:31
Take away is that a hot wallet is not just unsafe for finex it's unsafe for anyone, and should be used for small amounts only. 
That's a pretty simple concept - and would have lead to loosing a few pounds not thousands.
And to answer your dig...
Yes Actually I do! at one time I took coproxamol, (random painkiller) which after a few years they found out was causing heart attacks. [Source]( 
That led to a little research into Pharmaceutical companies and Doctors kickbacks, for using a particular brand. Then on to research about drug testing and trials, and how opposite conclusions from same data are rampant. 
Retractions of studies after going to market, are at an all-time high; recent cases of fraud have shaken many fields.  [Example](
I "break down and analyze" every part of my life, esp what's ingested or environmentally close, (as my local council can attest as they spend thousands getting rid of the damaged asbestos ceilings and floor tiles in my building)
I'd be a poor excuse for a human if I didn't take logical intelligent steps to know what is going on around me - esp when we have the entire internet at our disposal.
I'd also be just poor, if I used a new cryptocurrency without a little knowledge on how it can be stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:37:09
I believe fiat is regulated and insured, (not looked into it) but using a banking app that you know is valid, ie check hash. or get from bank any loss should be insured.
CryptoCoins though, where all is needed is the key, not I'd not have more than £100 in any wallet online. 
StockTrading apps, no idea.
Device itself compromised. that's also a possibility, friend, lodger, kangaroo, renting a room, could install something on your phone, and hack it even if the apps are valid.
Admittedly I'm twice your age and a dick, and come off as an arrogant fuck, but if there are two things I've learnt it's these;
1) Drive like everyone is out to kill you, from other drivers, animals, the road surface even the wind or rain.. then you may survive without a crash.
2) Everyone is after you cash, all the time, from you Door2Door boss, to the cleaner who cleans your rental room, Imagine all the ways they can get it, and prepare for them, and you may keep most of it.

This could also be a double scam:
   .
It would be difficult for Apple, or redditors, to differentiate between you and someone who is pulling a con.
    .
Con would be hearing about the fake wallets, downloading one to facilitate a scam on Apple.
Indicating that the hacked wallet stole the funds.
    .
In reality they moved them with the intention of making a hullabaloo,  then contacting Apple, hoping that with a few legal requests and posturing over a court case, they could get an out of court settlement and make bank.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:09:30
AppleStore has been insecure for at least the last six years, if your only research was the question you asked here
 [post](
(paraphrasing)  




And didn't do any searches [AppleStore Virus]( for example.
Getting infected on a PC is usually from downloading an infected app, so it follows getting an infected app on you iphone is going to be from the place you get you iphone apps - the AppleAppStore. 
Not trying to be clever at your expense here, really. But as you have by post admission, introduced many people to this, you may want to include some security tips the next time you introduce someone.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:35:13
I'm not saying you didn't do due diligence here, as I understand Apple is supposed to be walled to some extent.
However when I first purchased I did a little research, and ended up;
* downloading a live "tails" install, 
* setting it up on a thumbdrive,
* Booting into it from an offline PC 
* enabling the secure encrypted storage part.
* firing up the inc. electrum and making a wallet
* (saving seed etc and getting the master public key)
* 
Using the master Public to set up a "watching only wallet" on Online PC
Then sending the £200 / 0.4btc @ the time
Even then I was avidly watching the tx till they confirmed.
  .
Even with one weeks research I was totally not going to use a ONLINE wallet, of any kind to do anything but "watch" my transactions, as I knew the key is the money.
(easy enough to do offline signing with the tails install)
  .
To Send Tens of thousands to any online hot wallet....well lets say its not something I would ever be comfortable with.

Bitcoin Energy use is damaging the Climate ??
Andreas. . . So, I think this premise misunderstands both the function and the operation of the system.
For one thing there is a vast difference between energy production and energy consumption.
The idea that energy consumption is damaging to the climate is not accurate from a scientific perspective.
If you use a solar panel to consume the energy of the Sun that is already hitting almost every square centimetre of the surface of this planet, which is an ominous amount of energy that goes unrehearsed, that doesn't damage climate.
In fact if you use the energy from a solar panel, or from geothermal energy, from wind or from hydro energy and you use that to mine Bitcoin what it does is, allows you to create a smoother return on investment on the infrastructure that you invested in Alternative Energy (AE). Which increases the investment in AE thereby decreasing the economic cost of for example, solar panels, wind turbines and so forth while further increasing that infrastructure build.
Because Bitcoin is location independent;
* It doesn't have to be near population centres that product the most carbon dioxide,
* It doesn't have to be connected to traditional or classical, hydrocarbon based energy.
In fact it's connected to the least expensive and the least transportable, generally that is AE, that is produced at a time of least demand (usually waste energy) and/or produced to far from locations of demand due to lack of distribution networks.
From an economic perspective therefore Bitcoin stimulates the development of AE the way no other system does, and at the same time people that make this argument fail to see that economic activity in itself requires a system of value and payments,
traditional we do that with two infrastructures;
* We do it with cash, it costs Billions of dollars to print, destroy, circulate, clean, remove, transport physical cash from place to place.
* Also digitally in the centres of Banks and Credit Cards those take enormous amounts of energy to house employees who work on the systems, the computer systems themselves, fraud checking. (process and systems that are replaced by Bitcoin)
So we've got to look at what this replaces, it replaces something that is already very very energy intensive, but that energy use is hidden, and it replaces it from energy intensive hidden energy use that happens in the centre of our cites where it produces the great carbon dioxide footprint and it removes it to the most remote areas and to the most alternative and renewable forms of energy.
In the end this is a more environmentally friendly technology than our traditional payments.
**Once you understand it from that perspective this should be the choice of environmentalists.**

 I bought BTC in Sep 2013, I put down 16k. 5 years later it’s worth 606,478k I rented for those years and got 50,000 into debt with zero in my bank account. I bought a house for 200k cash and paid off my debt, I have 356k in the bank in a low risk investment and take 4% out per year ($14,000) in perpetuity.

Mobile are for hot wallets with small sums in.
Lightning wallets are for even smaller amounts.
Your secure offline storage is for your main funds,  and this procedure allows you to top up you other wallets securly
@_date: 2019-03-07 04:57:11
The simple gist is this,
You have electrum on a live USB drive like "tails" it includes electrum - and you can set up a secure partition by following the guides.
On your main PC, you install electrum and open a wallet by using the masterPUBLICkeys from your tailselectrum.
Now you have a secure offline wallet to send bitcoin to, and an online one where you can see your transactions appear.
If you want to sell, buy etc you boot up the offline tails and go through all the normal procedures of making a transaction - then copy that "safely" to your online PC, open the watching only wallet and there paste in the transaction and broadcast it.
Simple and secure once you do it a few times.

Yes, 150k for a house / apartment in a nicer area would be nice, 
but after looking at a random of estate agents here in the UK, 
£50k gets you an unlivable  beach chalet ($66,359.20)
£100k for a 1bed flat in a block of flats ($132,718.40)
You have to spend around £250k - £300k for a "detached house" ($398,155.21)
Here Flats and Apartments are really just converted houses and thin walled pits of noise and arguments.
And then you are not choosing the Area you live in - so choice of school/collage ammonites hospitals, job prospects etc are all dependant on the housing market and where you can buy cheapest.
Even when you do buy your accommodation - you have the upkeep on that - Gardening, External Maintenance, , Heating a larger place, furnishing it, A full set of carpets/curtains could easily cost £1000 per room etc etc its a liability not just an asset.
I guess our definition of a Lot / Hurge sum of money is different, but that is not related to our individual net worth, but more to a different outlook and understanding of how much you need to get away from the rat race of constant work till you die society that we live in.
A lot of money for me would be enough to live on without being forced to do things I didn't want to do.
I suppose that would be enough to travel to different countries and rent accommodation while there, have enough for food, clothing and emergency outlays - around £700pw  ($48,309.50) per annum.
To get that income, I would need an investment of min £550,000  ($729,951) returning 7% per year 
Yes I could as previously stated move from the UK, to a cheaper place, with lower job prospects, reduced medical services and eek out a living. 
By all means tell me exactly what you will do with the $400k
@_date: 2019-03-18 03:03:09
10k a year for 40years. 
Hrm, not going to be giving up your day job are you.
Also I hope you already have a house.
If you had **double** that, you could maybe get a steady income from the interest if it's invested wisely.
then you may be able to live the rest of your life with no money worries, if you were frugal and could get by on around 40k a year, including all your accommodation, medical, travel and family expensive.
But we don't have double that, we only have 400k so yes it isn't much.
It's perspective.
If your a kid and get given 400k, you think wow, lots of money to spend.
When your an adult, well see above.
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:07:50
It's an amount of money.
Can it get a first world person (where &lt;15k/annum is poverty) out of that poor accommodation, lack of job, bad area situation and give them a life where they don't have to take dangerous or soul destroying work - Probably not.
Could you start a business and have enough for several years - sure, and you may even be one of the 5% that make it.
Could you move to China or Estonia and buy a small holding and live a simple life for 50+ years  - sure probably.
Thinking you have "lots" of money when you only have 400k is why most people don't have 400k.

Not sure why you feel the need to keep using these sayings when referring to my posts.
You are trying to define the meaning of "large" "Huge" which is relative and subjective. 
Having a Huge amount of money is not synonymous with a 2bed FLAT in Portsmouth.
A Huge amount of money to me is a detached house in the country with a couple of acres for some chickens or a food garden.
Just because I think that a "Huge" amount is larger than your Huge amount does not mean I am more financially well off than you or 99% of the local populace.
As you don't seen to grasp this simple premise, despite me repeating it you are either trolling me or have a "Huge" deficit in your mental acuity both of which are reasons for me to see the pointlessness in engaging you in any meaning discourse. Good day.

I'm fully aware that the random shuffling is for the block of words surround your actually seed. I did watch your video fully. 
I'm afraid you don't seem to understand that if you can reverse and remove the shuffled words, you will obviously be left with the added seed words.
Your method in this respect is totally flawed, and will be cracked as soon as anyone is aware of it.
When you rely on obfusciation for security, the obfuscation needs to be random, otherwise it will offer no hiding place for a seed.
This is such an obvious flaw I'm not sure if you are hoping to scam people by promoting this, or you are innocent and just not that researched in how cryptography works.
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:30:56
Ohhh salty, did the nasty man on the internet just poor some commons sense on your attempt at seed storage.
Cryptography exists for a reason. Playing hide n seek is not a substitution.
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:18:40
You can put as many "sir's" in as you like.  but it doesn't change what you wrote, or your video, which is showing a way to lose your bitcoin.
You are now changing it to what?
Add a few extra words? from a normal dictionary??! Really. They can be removed instantly Because they are the ONLY normal dictionary words in there.
Hide your seed in a block of other seed words hoping for obfuscation is not a concept. It will not work.
Sorry if you don't like the label but your are going to get one of two labels here.
Either you are trying to get some scam going and in the future search for blocks of seed dictionaries to see if anyone has be totally brain dead and followed your advice.
Or you are just an incompetent, misunderstanding how incredibly easy it is to reverse your lame preschool level, "lets hide it here" brain fart.
So Scammer or Idiot - you decide, I'm not wasting anymore time on you. anyone who falls for this after my demonstration of how bad it is, kind of deserves what they get
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:55:17
Here, let me make it real simple for you- without advanced code knowledge.
You do it exactly as you describe, make a block of the default seed words, randomise it, 
repeat several times and end up with a block of 5 random sets, you do your "trick" of putting an actual seed in at whatever line you like
Along comes anyone with an ounce of intellect (sorry but you are an idiot at this point)
* They see this file could contain a wallet seed - because it has the wallet default wordlist
* They realise it's too large of a space for just one copy so must contain several duplicates of the word list
* They do a simple word search on several words "f3" and find that most words repeat 5 times, but some  repeat 6 times.
* They remove all words that repeat 5 times - and the sap loses his bitcoin.
I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt - but this is Bitcoin, full of people trying to scam others so I'm going to have to say just fuck off with you idiot scam.

58 private key.
Great, so that will be what I need to sweep all the coins to another wallet, sounds like a plan, and like your idea about practicing
will I even need to spend hours downloading the block, took around 80GB of stuff when setting up armory the first time, hoping with the install exe and and offline computer, armory will work sufficiently to let me restore the wallet and get that key.
Oh, yes, that was just random 4 letter key mashes for demonstation only ;) (appreciate you thinking otherwise and giving the appropriate warning though)

@_date: 2019-06-20 14:47:49
That's "almost" a good way of storing seeds.
Unfortunately the error you make here is with the shuffling process.
* Who's website is it?, 
* what code do they use to do the suffling?
* Is it Random?
* is it just pseudo random?
This will matter because someone with that word list and knowledge of the code used to generate the "shuffle" can work backwards and then compare and find the string you added, ie your seed.
(As a lay person you may not see how that would work, but anyone with a background in code and cryptography can with a little thought see the issues here.)
A way of circumventing this is to do a proper random shuffle yourself, using true random data.
Also as an aside, it would be a little more secure if you just counted the words until the start of your seed string, 
and then chose to remember that one number, instead of a birthday.
Someone's birthday is incredibly easy to find out - so don't ever use it as a pointer, despite it's rememberability. 
Hope that gives you something to think about.

Well I had a play with armory, with a practice wallet, and restoring works fine, as does getting all the key info (but empty wallet so no actual private/public keys that are sweepable)
grabbed electrum, and played with some wallets, and how to sweep keys to the wallet - again as I'm messing with empty wallets, on an offline PC, can't really run through the process entirely.
Just going to read up on paper wallet, want to see if I can transfer from armory while off line, and only then send some to an online electrum.
Took me a while as my offline netbook from the prehistoric era, takes ages.

Well said,  PumpGAS  fully agree, most are exchanging security for convenience,  they still need to follow the same secure practices and procedures with the HW Wallets backups, the only benefit is now they have a little device to fawn over.
Less than 50 - stick it on a web wallet

Yes end point nodes being compromised is always a worry with using TOR
I don't use TOR when dealing with anything legit.
So I guess you meant be careful using TOR, not tails in general
although I grant TOR is included for standard web access.
Tails is a great portable secure way of having an offline wallet, I wouldn't use it on a PC that had a internet connection - as that kinda defeats my use case of having it offline. :)
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:10:41
When you download tails, you assume it's compromised, and once booted from, you use it to make another more secure thumbdrive from the first one.
Which you also assume, could be bad, so you use it offline and with an encrypted partition.
Personally I even assumed my window and pets, including any baby monitors webcams and other electrical device or even phone "wire" was compromised - and my seeds were generated in the brick outhouse where no windows etc were present... It may be extreme, but its only needed once initially - and for offline signing.
Even my talking about this - is on alt account - and even my main account is anonymous to a large degree. :)
It's your cash, don't lose it due to laziness.  
Best to workout what to do first - then imagine all the possibly ways it could be compromised and close those doors.

I slapped myself, twice, as its 85% of my net worth.
Secondly I got very creative in seed storage.

Seems to me this entire thread is a advertisement for hardware wallets, and probably shills here from said companies.  
Hi there.
While they are useful and used properly should be secure, there is no substitute for using actual safe practices and procedures.
You can easily get monkey brained halfwits thinking they are safe and buying second hand ones, or ones from fake companies, even not reading the instructions and using them incorrectly.
I'll say it again, read up on security, and work out a safe procedure for gaining access to your funds with as little risk as possible.
I mean for the love of the glowing fairy cock, putting all your funds in ONE wallet WTF.  And then online - bloody asking for it. 
It's not difficult - just don't have online access to your main funds

$500? 
What are you smoking? Hedging your bets with that title?
It's gone up $300 at most in 24hours if you take the lowest to highest.
Which is great, no need wax lyrical about an imaginary amount.

All you needed was a live "tails" install on a USB which comes with electrum included.
Set up persistent storage on the tails, and it will save your electrum in an encrypted section.
Then just have a live watchingonly version of electrum on your main Online PC.
You can then sign any transactions with the offline tails and broadcast with the online one.
Why you thought putting a quarter of a million + on an online computer would be fine, is something only you can answer.

I just wanted to edit image, for personal use.
Props to original though, here is my small edit crop.

If you don't know what you are doing, then listen to the hardware wallet shills as that's about as good a security for your crypto as you are capable of.
If on the other hand, you take the time to do some research then yes electrum on tails is totally 100% safe if you follow proper practices that you researched.
* You use a live usb key.
* You create your wallet when noone is looking over your shoulder (includes windows, talking parrots, baby monitors etc)
* You use it on a system that is never connected to the internet (old laptop)
* You have your wallet seed backed up in several locations (this is your access to your coin should the laptop or usb keys get lost destroyed etc.)
* Your backup seeds are on stainless steel and hidden, or in plain view but encrypted etc
* You load up a "hot" wallet with small amounts of coin for weekly use (By sending from the laptop, via offline signing and a clean thumb drive)
If you can't do these things then just play with a few hundred in a bluewallet on your phone, as you are not ready to be your own bank, and BTC isn't ready to pander to you either.
A HW wallet is not any safer and certainly not for a large amount - You still could fall foul of many many issues not the least being compromised man in the middle, issues with the device to bad actors at company making them, and you STILL obviously have to keep the seed safe. 
If you can't be your own bank, a HW wallet is not going to help you (Not even useful for small amounts, as you may as well use your phone - but the company reps will tell you to buy one - because money)

Sorry it took a while to get the tips sent,  I went down the rabbit hole of secure linux with persistent storage and researching randomness / entropy then forgot what my name was and wandered about in my underpants...
5 months later I surfaced and realised I knew what to do.
