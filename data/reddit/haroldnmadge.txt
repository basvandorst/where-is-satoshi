I'll "be careful" not to hit my head on the moon...

I'm not saying it will or won't burst, but people were saying the EXACT same things during the .com bubble. Both newly adopted technologies with mass investment built on excessive speculation. Very interested to see what happens...

Good to hear. They are nowhere near as inflated as Coinspot from what I've seen, so I'm all good. :)

I'm in tech and even newer to this than you. It's natural to think like that.  It would have been so easy just to buy heaps of bitcoin in 2009 or even later.  It would have been so easy to buy Google shares when they were released.  Uber, I could have thought of that!
Hindsight is a bitch!! The majority of the world didn't see this happening, just like the GFC. Some people were extremely gifted with their thoughts or had the money to put it to use and other people were extremely lucky to hang on to their bitcoin.  
It could be worse.  You could be the guy that spent 36 BTC on a pizza or the guy that threw away his hard drive with hundreds of BTC on it. Go easy on yourself and remember you're earlier than other people jumping in when BTC hits 50k.  To the motherflippin' moon!

Other people I know had to do it as well and it says it could be required (up to ten days) even though their electronic photo test verified it within 2 minutes. Quite strange.

Have you used Independent Reserve? I signed up tonight as I was sick of Coinspots ridiculous markups and fees and I'm still waiting for the snail mail verification from BTC Markets. How do you rate Coinjar also?
