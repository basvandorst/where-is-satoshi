So after the gox debacle, all of the reddit experts kept saying 'ohh, you should keep your coins locked away in cold storage in a vault under 24 hour surveillance by paratroopers etc etc etc', so we should not be surprised when noone wants to use their stash to buy anything. This is where we are falling over, there are very few areas or operators with whom we can keep our coins with even a semblance of confidence.

Bullet dodged!

That comment is ridiculous. So several million coins in the hands of thieves does not harm bitcoin? Seriously. How can we ever regain the trust for people to use exchanges again. Yes, we will hear the same old story 'store your coins offline'. That's all well and good, so how is bitcoin going to go mainstream if everyone has their coins in cold storage? We can preach decentralisation all we like, but we can never change the greed of humans.

Just trying to read between the lines. Karpeles said in the IRC interview that a) The coins were not  'accessible' and b) he had to see a lawyer. Is it possible that a regulatory or government agency have frozen the assets?

Formatting is your friend. I think I understood the Japanese version more.

It all depends on the amount i guess. I would try contacting him via phone as mentioned above. If it was a significant amount, well i am sure it would not be hard to maybe offer a small 'bounty' for someone to go and visit him*.

I sent my documents in early December 2013, and finally got verified yesterday, so you may not be far away now.

What we must also remember is the the BF pay the developers of the code. This is a critical factor IMO.

One thing we need to remember is that most people make purchases where they can pay in installments, for example via credit cards and interest free etc. Those people will feel that they do not have this option with bitcoin, and we will definitely see an increase in those numbers with the development of credit card type bitcoin payment systems. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:09:48
Absolutely. We do not have a single exchange that we can use with some degree of confidence.

So at a wild guess, what percentage of bitcoins are in the hands of thieves? 15%? 20%? How this can be considered a good thing is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:27:02
Yes, and of course doge has been around for much much longer.......

Upvoted. 2FA does not account for people's greed. Source: MtGox

They promote such upstanding crypto companies such as Butterfly Labs and Mt Gox.

As they should. Just because it is unregulated, you just can't go and 'lose'  millions and millions of dollars of other peoples money. They were registered in Japan and The United States at the very least, and have identification information for hundreds of thousands of customers. They just cannot set sail into the sunset.

Umm, ok so use a site that has at best maybe 12 players on it at a time, compared to the biggest poker platform in the world who has thousands of people playing at any given time....

The Bitcoin Foundation has been conspicuous by it's silence on this issue. They are representing Bitcoin how?
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:23:28
Unfortunately we as a community cannot even come together and agree on something like nodes, so this may be a little hard.
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:10:21
I would have thought MK would be high on that list lol

Great tweet, however one could argue that point 8 contradicts point 6 and 7

So how have we gone by knowing who runs gox, neo, bitstamp.....

I would say devcoin is a pretty good idea, probably needs more support though.

I bought my first bitcoin for around $1100. I subsequently bought more at around 1000,900,800 and 500 during the first China collapse. I then proceeded to lose about a third of my coins at Gox and also got scammed by someone for some asics miners who was supposed to be one of the most reputable in the crypto community. All in all i now have roughly 15% of bitcoins left and they are only worth roughly 3% of total investment. So yeah, maybe you aren't so bad off hey lol

It looks like a lot of time and effort went into this. Easy to criticise....i assume you may have something better to show us?
