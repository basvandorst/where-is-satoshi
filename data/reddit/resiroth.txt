What are you talking about? My point is that "approximately 4% of the world is tying their wealth exclusively to bitcoin." doesn't mean shit, because just because you list your home for bitcoins doesn't magically make bitcoins worth more dollars.

Colluding might be a stretch, but having a shared interest in keeping in line with OPECs prices would be accurate. See: Verizon/Tmobile/Sprint etc. charging anything at all for texting for basically a decade despite it costing 0 dollars for them to do. Sure, they could all have offered dramatic discounts compared to the other firms, but they knew that would spark a price war down. If you don't understand econ 101 (and how a major firm can't effectively set the price for the market) then I am not surprised you're in @_date: 2014-03-20 22:11:45
You're also hanging out on hardly a non-bias source of news.  is at least more realistic in terms of where you can expect the price to go in the future. 
This subreddit downvotes genuine negative articles about bitcoin, unfortunately positive articles about bitcoin are drowned in negative articles (repeat stories about the same negative event) in news aggregation sites.
Can't really win.

In my other comments I have talked about wedding bands not being an economic investment (as they are pretty much entirely sentimental in nature). 
I calculated using this website 4 grams of 24k gold:  and got 120 dollars estimated value (after extraction costs with 0 profit), of which pawn shops pay 40-70% so you're looking at ~50-84 dollars real world for a 24k ring.
**Furthermore 24k is not used in jewelry at all as it is too soft: so really you're looking at an 18k ring at best, or 73 dollars, 40-70% real world means a whopping ~28-49 dollars.** If your idea of an investment is a depreciating asset you can sell later for 30 bucks I guess that's up to you...

Er, read some history. After they had broken the enigma encryption they wanted to be sure the germans didn't change it. So they flew spy planes first directly to where they knew the germans would be and then orchestrated an attack. They made it seem like they were just "lucky" and even sent out decoy spy planes to have an appearance that they didn't have a working decryption method. 
Did that happen in this case? I'm not sure. Could it have happened? Easily. 
And SR2 is filled with scammers apparently (I don't use it), and there were some allegations of law enforcement and such. Regardless the government shut down the most legitimate site, and clearly has damaged the reputation of all others (they usually either go down, go missing with all the coins etc.) the damage has been done. I imagine if they really wanted to they could shut down other sites, but the volume isn't sufficient to warrant it (do you spend 500k going after a random drug ebay with 30 listings or 30 meth labs?)

I suppose, the "loyalty" programs always need your phone number it seems so they might already be using the phone number to link across stores.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:57:54
Such bravery. What did I say was incorrect? If a store literally never receives a single bitcoin in a wallet they control, how is that accepting bitcoin? They never even receive a single bitcoin!
I'm glad you brought up facts...here are some of them:
Prices are listed in dollars.
They only receive dollars.
They don't have to deal with chargebacks
They pocket the transaction costs instead of giving them back.
You actually pay 1% more essentially because you don't get cashback from your credit card.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:31:46
Haha wow that certainly is different than the US! It's a lot cheaper here. 
The 2% bit isn't really accurate since half of that goes back to the consumer in the form of reward points. So it's more like 1% (or even less considering the size of chipotle). It's 1.8% for a random coffee shop to swipe VISAs, I would hope chipotle negotiates its rate. 
Say chipotle negotiates its rate down to 1.6%, 1% goes back to customer (or more, since a lot of the time cards have discounts on restaurants but whatever) so the transaction costs .6% to process. 
In the US burritos are like 6 bucks, so 8 cents to send bitcoins would be 1.25%, or twice as expensive as VISA would be. Alternatively in Canada that 8 cents still is .8%, or 33% more expensive than VISA. 
So indeed bitcoins can be more expensive than credit cards in retail. Online the fees are quite a bit higher (15 cents + 2.3%) so for smallish transactions (2 dollar ebook for ex.) bitcoins could be noticeably better. 
That being said dwolla is 0 fee for purchases less than 10 bucks so that kind of kills bitcoins niche there...
Do you know why bitcoin transaction fees are so high and the transaction time so long? For digital goods online (where bitcoin fees are a bit more competitive than credit cards depending on the negotiate rate) I imagine waiting an hour to get something you usually got instantly won't fly. Imagine buying a new song and having to wait an hour to get it! I can't imagine why it is 8 cents to process a transaction, should be 1 cent or less.
I think most people don't mind paying 1% for security/buyer protection though. If a bitcoin wallet offered 0 liability (not sure how they'd even do that) in the event it was stolen and had buyer protection I think a lot of people would be interested...despite this product being basically a credit card. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:03:30
Yep, but the difference in price is not over 2-3% in my experience. I've done it buying cars but never with groceries etc. 
I usually just find internet deals for my large purchases, rarely in store, but I'll try it some time soon.

Not really. If someone said they expected to give 100x returns you should say "you're fucking insane" and walk out the door. Returns like that should not be (and in pretty much all cases aren't) expected.
Also: doesn't help that FB paid almost exclusively in overvalued stock. WhatsApp has a revenue less than 20 million a year for a pay back time of roughly 1000 years (assuming they have 0 costs of operating which is ridiculous to say the least). That whole bubble will likely pop soon. That's not to say there aren't legitimate huge VC wins, but its no coincidence that the vast majority of what FB used to buy those companies was stock. Wouldn't surprise me if WhatsApp is used as a good example of how distorted and idiotic people can be (basing value on users, regardless of revenue/profit).

On Cyber monday Amazon alone sold 426 items per second. This seems like a serious problem. To handle peak transactions that would mean ~60MB every 10 minutes. or 9 GB a day?? I guess you could use a light client, but I'm not really familiar with the disadvantages/advantages of that (other than not downloading the blockchain of course).

@_date: 2014-04-01 05:36:02
Also they have users, but they often don't have revenue. Sometimes you can monetize them with ads, other times it backfires. Sometimes a startup steals their userbase incredibly rapidly (facebook vs myspace) other times it has continued stability (facebook). It's a pretty insane market to invest in period, especially when the bubble is likely about to burst (buying a company for 19 billion that has 20 million in revenue is fucking insane).

What if I told you, anyone can get prepaid debit cards? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:14:20
Yep, still ridiculous. You're talking about a scenario where a digital crypto currency with no government backing, ripe for money laundering , no consumer protection, high barriers of entry for a consumer to use (I want to buy bitcoins in the next 10 seconds for ex.), slow confirmation times (whereas credit/debit is instant), high chance of money being stolen (which the user is then blamed for) etc. replaces status quo for the last 800 years. 
At its core bitcoin has some serious issues for consumer adoption. I think a crypto currency might eventually become standard, but it will be backed by a major nation, highly regulated, not even remotely anonymous and offer similar consumer protections as the current system does. Basically dollar 2.0. **This seems all the more likely given that any reasonable criticism levied toward bitcoin (potentially with the goal of improving it if possible) is seen as a personal attack.**
Furthermore now instead of being robbed for your iPhone, you'll be robbed for your life savings. They could just drive you back to your home and force you to transfer everything you had. 
My theory on what would actually get mass adoption:
US backing
2% inflation (miners would get this)
Extremely fast confirmations (Current system is seconds, have to match it)
The exact opposite of anonymous (or else you'll be accused of facilitating child pornography/criminals even if that's not true)
Consumer protection/chargebacks
Ability to "mark" coins as criminal/unable to be accepted/outcast.
This is so far away from bitcoin it's not even funny. **I am excited about crypto currencies but bitcoin has a loooooong way to go before someone wants to wait 30 minutes to buy groceries.**

If you consider wedding bands (a lot of which are presumably buried by now) gold reserves, sure. You'd also have to consider gold plated headphones jacks etc. as "reserves". The 8 trillion figure is for all gold that has ever been mined from the earth, whether it's in a scrap heap in an unusable form, a wedding band or a bar of gold bullion. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:55:43
Okay so you're saying that if I use my credit card I get 1% discount, and I also get 1% discount because it's a rewards card. And if I pay in bitcoin I get a 3% discount. So the net difference is...gasp..1%! 
Source:  
Bitcoins are (unsurprisingly) very hard to buy with credit cards (because they can be easily stolen + hard to track bitcoins after they've been bought) with fees over 4% to buy.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:46:35
People don't consider wedding bands a financial investment (at least I hope not, as in the case of females you'll be lucky if you get 1/4 of what you paid). 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:23:19
I listed my concerns, pros are that I can easily send money to a friend, I don't have to convert my currency if I'm in another country, I can pay with my phone (though if apple gets in the payment game this might not longer be an advantage), there isn't any inflation (although I wouldn't want a lot of liquid capital anyway).
Just because there are disadvantages doesn't mean I don't see the potential of crypto currencies in general, or modified bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-23 06:49:53
Difference is that you can't steal much of a .1%'s money. Seriously, you can't. OP is talking about millions of dollars, you can't steal 2+ million dollars from someone at gunpoint irreversibly like you can with bitcoin. 
If someone was known to keep millions of dollars under their mattress you're damn right they'd have visitors, but no one does this because that's crazy.

Maybe it will, but in fact I think most people in bitcoin are young tech guys. Tech is one field where earnings don't increase that much (nice starting salary but much harder to get up into 6 figures outside of SF/NYC). 
I think that if more people adopt bitcoin, sure the price will increase...but again people expressing the value of their house in bitcoin doesn't mean bitcoin is worth more. Shit I'll sell my computer for a million bitcoins, does that mean that the price is going to nosedive based upon my random evaluation (with 0 sale taking place)?
**The USD marketcap is 10.5 trillion (including non-paper currency), not the amount of material wealth in the US (125 trillion). For bitcoin to have a marketcap of 9.36 trillion it would have to essentially be the new dollar.**

For 12 bucks a month intuit will charge a 1.75% fee.  Businesses can't accept bitcoin right now since it might drop 30% in a day, preventing them from paying rent etc. so they have to go through coinbase which charges 1%. Most businesses honestly are paying 2% or less for processing credit cards.
The savings associated with bitcoin are likely less than 1% if using coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:31:11
Well it does mean that they start out with bitcoin and then have to manually convert it. That takes additional effort. They might wonder why they were converting it and just decide to keep it in bitcoin. That was my thought process at least.

@_date: 2014-03-21 00:10:02

You generally don't get much credit for using a debit card, the point is that they want you to owe money, and pay it off. If you never owed anyone money then that isn't "proof" in their mind that you will pay back a future loan. That's their reasoning at least (not that I agree with it really).

I actually was here since the beginning (well, early 2010). Not on but I was interested in it then and I'm interested in it now. 
I see the potential with cryptocurrencies in general, but not with the current iteration. I couldn't agree more that bitcoin is a beta. If it were more receptive to legitimate criticisms I think bitcoin could be saved...we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:00:30
No, it's like trying to use a currency to buy something from a popular store. Apparently that's a stupid example. 
You're also assuming that for some reason if you're paying in bitcoin you by definition don't need to make an account, but if you're paying with a cc you do. Not having to make an account is not an inherent advantage of bitcoin, it's a separate issue (and is dumb I agree). 
You also completely negated any retail use. In a store all you need to do is swipe and you're done (maybe enter 4 digit pin) or sign a piece of paper in a second, but often just a swipe (or more commonly a tap) and you're done. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:52:59
Demand is the number of bitcoins that will be purchased at a given price. Has nothing to do with numbers of people. 
The demand doesn't change if more people are bitcoin owners (someone gives them 1 millibit or w/e as a gift). The number of people wanting to buy bitcoins at a certain price is irrelevant, it could be 1 million or 1 guy. 
There are plenty of people out there that would buy bitcoin at 400, or 200, or 10 dollars. But that doesn't increase the price at all, since it's below the going rate.
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:34:38
I still don't see how bitcoin gets around this. Say target accepts bitcoin, they still see what you're buying and log it presumably. Just have a 2% "rewards" program and raise the price of everything 2% to match. Grocery stores are infamous for this, 3 for 5, or 3.99 each if you aren't a "member" etc.
True they can't hack your bitcoins in the same way the CCs were hacked, but you're not liable for theft so it has no impact on the end user. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:37:23
 bitcoin looks at this and laughs. A worse version of this already happened essentially. Furthermore there are things in place today to prevent panic selling.

Yes, you got in early so it's nice for you, but if you want this to achieve mainstream adoption you have to convince people to start now. 
As for it being easier to pay with bitcoin than a credit card? Okay, we're at target. I swipe in less than ~2 seconds. You can't even pay at target, strike 1. Say we're at a place where you can pay with bitcoin. I guess you type in their address? maybe scan a QR code if you're using a mobile phone? Then type in your password to your wallet. Then wait for confirmations. I swipe, done in under 10 seconds confirmed.

So you're saying that while currently they could save 1% with no effort and no change to the customer experience, they're going to continue using square. However they're also going to add a completely new payment system which is responsible for less than 1 % of all purchases in the US, in order to save 2%.
The people still using square are doing so because they don't care about 1-2% (which is fine, convenience tends to win).
I've only seen cash discounts for gas, and cars. Can you walk into target/walmart/j crew or w/e and ask for a cash discount? 
I agree that it will be interesting to see what happens. I know few people would support this but I think US-backed digital currency would be interesting. A serious shortcoming of credit cards is that it is hard to send a friend 10 bucks for ex.  is trying to solve that, but I'm a bit skeptical of the security + I'm sure they'll start overcharging shortly even though right now it's free. 
And I'm really not out to bash bitcoin, I just think a big reason it isn't used a lot for transactions/limited adoption (for non-speculative purposes) is that it doesn't have a lot of the benefits associated with credit cards. Especially when things like this exist:  which is apparently 1.8% + 15 cents per swipe for 0 monthly fees. If a business was in trouble, or wanting to make more money...I doubt that ~.8% (difference between this and coinbase) is going to convince them. I do think that in 5 years a digital cash of some variety will be pretty common. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:26:38
10x is extremely optimistic, but possible. We're down from 4 months ago market cap wise for example...I think it's because we've reached speculation saturation, for it to grow it actually has to be spent...something few bitcoiners seem to want to do (because they're longing for those fabled 1000x returns).

K but not necessarily. That's my whole point. Also: introducing more people to the bitcoin demand curve doesn't mean that it changes anything (if people find out about bitcoin, and would be willing to pay 1 dollar).
Demand is the number of bitcoins that will be purchased at a given price. That's just how demand is defined from an economics standpoint. If you want to define it differently, that's fine, but it's not the normal definition used by economists. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:05:15
Target customers aren't liable. I agree with you that there could be improvements overall though. I don't know if you're aware of this, but square cash seems like a pretty cool idea (0% fee right now but they'll probably jack it up eventually unfortunately).

For sure, low-income people won't benefit from credit cards. But I also think low-income people won't benefit from bitcoin. Oh darn the price dropped 10% this week, guess we won't be able to afford heating this month etc. 
Are you talking about being lucky by getting in early as cashback? Since that is nice, but useless to people considering bitcoin today. **I'm mostly saying that the current pricing system incorrectly portrays visa as being cheaper than bitcoins, when in reality bitcoins have a lower overall cost.**

Well they often give you ~1/5 the price of actual gold being sold. Average wedding band is 4 grams, or 4/28 = .143 ounces * 1350 per ounce /5 (because getting that gold back is a pain and they want to make money) = $38.61.
Wow 38 bucks. So 10 wedding bands is worth as much as an iphone from 2 years ago! What a great investment. Jewelry is not even remotely a store of value. That's like saying shoes are a store of value in that, yeah, on craigslist you might be able to get 1/20th of the price you paid (just like jewelry).
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:39:59
That's pretty cool, but I've heard coinbase is better for the customer in terms of convenience. The slight problem of course is that you'd have to be selling more than 36k in bitcoin sales a year (which I imagine most small businesses adopting bitcoin won't) for it to be less than 1%. 
It's a lot of effort for 1% more revenue for the few that actually use bitcoin. If that 1% actually is significant (like someone buying a car) then the person wouldn't be paying with a credit card anyway. 
The money saved compared to credit cards really is minimal contrary to what you might expect. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:52:46
Pedantic point, gold has some value in industrial applications. Not a ton (compared to say platinum), but if gold were cheaper it would be used more. Probably worth ~20% of its current price just for industrial applications. Worth noting that the majority of gold usage is in jewelry, just because it looks nice I guess (as if it were exclusively based on value platinum rings would be the new thing).

Uh, if your money is being seized you're probably engaging in a pretty serious crime. Also: you think the US isn't just going to straight up go to your country and extradite you?

If you want to pay anonymously for bitcoins you're likely going to have to pay over the exchange/market rate and potentially at personal risk. Is that worth the current solution of walking into a gas station without cameras, paying in cash for some "pay" card at a 5% premium? 
I agree in theory that this is where bitcoin should shine, but the gas station pay cards already do a decent job here imo.

Right, but you're crazy if you think that the stock market is a bigger bubble than bitcoin. Do you really think bitcoin is a currency first or an investment first? How many people got into bitcoin to try and get rich? Ask yourself honestly. People keep talking about how it's still "early" early for what? If people care about the ideology behind bitcoin it being "early" is irrelevant (and it most definitely isn't as early as people suggest).

private fire protection? Sounds like a great idea. I think the romans tried that, Crassus made off with ~2 trillion right? What a great system. 
The poor in this situation just die right? Also a great system. And before you say charity, charity never has been remotely as helpful as social programs today. 
Also: the IRS absolutely doesn't want to throw you into jail, they are willing to bend over backwards. It's the weird reason why people (in practice, not ideologically) like the IRS as they're very interested in helping you pay your debts back slowly. However, just like other countries, if you outright refuse to pay a debt repeatedly eventually you'll be jailed/imprisoned.
I don't think the state is the only way to provide  these goods, but I sure as hell think they can do a better job in a lot of industries. Imagine if comcast owned your roads? How do you switch road providers? You're a free-market lover, but rational lovers of small government realize that certain goods in particular (roads etc.) cannot be provided by a private company properly. **The solution is to have a private company maintain the roads by creating competition in the bidding process, which in many ways is closer to your goal of free-market competition.**
I'm not even in favor of a huge government (I'm even, believe it or not, in favor of a smaller government than we have now...mostly with regard to military), but you're crazy if you're longing for roads to be privatized, how the hell would that even work?
And if you say the existence of toll roads as an example, the US has "private roads" too. The thing is that it also has public roads. **Give me an example of a 1st world country that has EXCLUSIVELY private roads, exclusively private street lighting, exclusively private police etc.** As it stands now the US fulfills virtually all of those requirements by offering private solutions, as well as public ones (with the exception of utilities depending on where you live, they're private where I live and I pay 30 cents per kw, giving sempra energy the highest energy profits of any utility company on the planet...good times).

Also say you buy a product on the internet and have it shipped. It gets there 1 week later and guess what (as of this comment) bitcoins are now worth 8.66% less than they were last week!

Here's one reason. You can sell at a "loss" then buy back even more bitcoins than you had initially. Obviously this isn't a sure thing, but you act like selling is insane. Selling is very reasonable if you think it will continue to decrease. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:46:18
It's more like if you don't have the reward card program/use cash or bitcoin you'll pay extra. You think they're going to give you the 1% difference? How much does overstock give you back for paying in bitcoin?

So we should trust shadowstats (a "better" source some people have pointed out), a for-profit website that charges 175 dollars per year to view his "stats", but not the government because they're clearly engaging in widespread conspiracy to manipulate inflation numbers just to spite bitcoin adoption?
If the government wanted they could essentially destroy it tomorrow by making it illegal to sell, possess or manufacture bitcoins. And yeah, it would still exist underground, but it wouldn't actually do anything other than let some people buy crack on the internet.

True but the rate bitcoins are being added isn't that significant in the overall amount now, is it? I forget how much is being added daily now. If we start out at 12.5 mil coins, and add 2.5 mil a year (I think it's less than this but not positive) that's only 20%...relative to the 10,000%+ that people are predicting for a price increase. 
Honestly bitcoin seems relatively stable around 500-1k...Since most people hoard their bitcoins I don't see the economy expanding very much. We're past the investment stage, from here on out the growth will be based on actual economic factors (I hope). 
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:00:53
I think a baby step would be accepting bitcoin and immediately exchanging it for fiat. I don't see how this is a step at all. Can't you already sell bitcoins and just spend that money? Isn't that what this is essentially? 
I'm mostly disappointed that none of these retailers are giving back any of the fees they are saving. One of the arguments for bitcoin is that you can save a couple %, not giving that back to the consumer makes people less interested in it when visa works just as well and gives them 1% back (even though I know it's more complicated than that, it looks like that from the eyes of a consumer). 
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:15:12
Coinbase is 1% after 1 million 
Visa is often below 2% for larger retailers. As an example EMS charges 2.25% and a random taxi guy could get this rate. You can be sure that amazon gets a much better rate.

Yeah Neo seems interesting, but what about this: "Bee functions like a bitcoin-based debit card system – offering merchant terminals and cards with EMV chip and PIN technology, with the added bonus of faster settlement processing times and lower fees."
I'm curious what those fees are...and you still of course have the problem that I can buy a ton of digital goods (say gift cards) at once and if they accept it before waiting for confirmations then they're screwed. If they wait for confirmations then the consumer is annoyed. Can't win it seems...
Bitcoin had a lot of potential in microtransactions but these days companies just sell a certain amount of "coins" for 10 bucks or w/e and then use those to buy things with.

Not selling is also gambling, you just think it's going to go up. Selling and not-selling are literally identical actions in that both rely on a belief, both can never be 100% certain etc. Selling is just as rational as not selling, and by not selling it's not like you're not making an action. Not selling should be thought of as an act, which people rarely perceive it as. It's a conscious decision which could gain or lose money, just like selling.

Did you delete it straight up or did you just reinstall windows? I did the latter. It was very early (I don't consider the present early, returns of 10x maybe but nothing like the 10000x returns we saw initially). I only mined a couple days and then realized my gpu was far better suited to folding at home. One of the biggest mistakes of my life, but people forget back then it was magic internet money worth a cent if that. I'm also positive I would have sold half at 30, half at 100-200 and another half at 800ish so wouldn't have necessarily made millions but still... I guess on the upside I helped some people with folding at home! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:27:14
It's not still early. Early is selling a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins. That's the early people are talking about. **What if you "got in early" at 200 and dropped 1k on it? Now you might have 3k. Might. What if you "got in early" at 1 cent and dropped 1k on it? Now you might have 60 Million.** 
People that are looking to "invest" in bitcoin might drop 1,000 in it, and they desperately want to believe this will make them rich. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. Thus people delude themselves into thinking that they too can get the 60,000x return enjoyed by early adopters. Unfortunately that would mean a market cap of 1 quadrillion dollars...unlikely to say the least.

When's the last time you got a discount for using cash? I don't think businesses will pass along the 1.25% (at most) savings associated with accepting bitcoin since they currently don't pass along the ~2% savings associated with accepting cash.

I listed my concerns, pros are that I can easily send money to a friend, I don't have to convert my currency if I'm in another country, I can pay with my phone (though if apple gets in the payment game this might not longer be an advantage), there isn't any inflation (although I wouldn't want a lot of liquid capital anyway).
Point is that yes, there are advantages...but there are also disadvantages. Unfortunately pointing these out tend to elicit down votes. It's unfortunate because a lot of these issues could be addressed, but they won't be if people deny they're a problem.

It also helps build your credit to be fair, and as much as I dislike the financial industry I understand the need for a payment history in order for someone to say "sure I'll foot 500k for this house, I trust you." 
An analogous situation to bitcoins is a debit card which also usually has rewards of 1% global cashback and no liability for theft. 
It's really best to get a credit card though, it's not hard to get one if you have any income at all, and they increase the limits very quickly at least in my experience.

Accepting bitcoins directly is 8 cents per transaction (charged to consumer) which is indeed pretty cheap, but dwolla for ex. is 25 cents per transaction, with no fee below 10 dollars. I guess my point is that transaction fees are already quite low (have to consider the consumer gets 1%+ cashback too, making the real rate 1% less than the seller pays). I've seen rates of 1.8% swiping in person (0 fee per swipe) which is .8% real world. That's better than coinbase, and even if you were paying in bitcoin directly it costs 8 cents to send a payment, so it's cheaper up to 8 bucks. 
You also have to consider bitcoin transactions are far from instant, what if you want to go into a store and pick up some toner at the last minute? Or what if you're buying a TV? They're definitely going to want to wait for confirmations then. 
If credit cards were charging 5%, and bitcoins were like .1% then maybe consumers would be interested, but I kind of doubt it. There are already a lot of websites that give 2-4% cashback on popular websites by giving you a portion of their referral fee, but few bother to use them (and they're a lot less hassle than switching to bitcoin).

Yearly transaction volume doesn't really work for bitcoin as the vast majority of volume is due to trading bitcoins/USD (back and forth) not bitcoins for a product. 
Overstock, by far the largest retailer accepting bitcoin, just now made 1 million in bitcoin sales in 2 months. In the last 24 hours exchange volume was 13 million. So ~16k a day for overstock vs 13 million a day in exchanges. So exchanges have 815x the volume of the largest (by far) retailer accepting bitcoins (or more accurately accepting dollars that were from someone selling their bitcoins). 
It's hard to determine whether someone is exchanging bitcoin for product (as people tumble/split huge amounts of bitcoin but it never really changes hands...just addresses). I don't see your point about spending bitcoin elsewhere thus doubling bitcoins productivity. Bitcoin is identical to dollars in that they are both currencies. Your house is worth an amount of bitcoins, and an amount of dollars. 
Bitcoins total circulated value is the marketcap, just like USD's total circulated value is the marketcap of USD. To buy all the bitcoins you'd need ~7.7 billion at the going rate. To buy all the dollars in bitcoin you'd need ~16 billion bitcoins at the going rate. 
I guess I'm not sure what you're trying to say...but what people are predicting is bitcoins to have the same marketcap as dollars do. If you're saying that how frequently something is exchanged for a product is a measure of its health as a currency I'd agree...but again overstock sold something like 1.3 billion in 2013, and they're on track to make 6 million (if that, wouldn't surprise me if the trend is down since the initial spike) in sales from bitcoin. Furthermore overstock is the only legitimate online mega-retailer (amazon etc.) that accepts bitcoin so if anything bitcoin's performance relative to the dollar is inflated. Still, ~200x as much money is being gained from dollar purchases over bitcoin atm. All of that is just a metric of health of the currency (that it's not being hoarded, which bitcoin by and large is...imagine how weird it would be if someone bought 1% of all dollars and just held onto them for investment purposes...not exactly good for the economy). 
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:44:36
Square is notoriously expensive, Intuit is 1.75%, and many companies negotiate below that even. I also am a bit puzzled why you say most people don't use credit cards to protect themselves from merchants, and then guess that 1% of purchases is charged back. I really doubt it's that high. 
Let me ask you this, with overstock accepting bitcoin now, how much do you save? How much do they give you back? Clearly it should be over 1%, right? Say I use my 1% rewards card, and you use bitcoins. I get 1% back, and you get...0% back? Interesting...it seems as though the consumer doesn't benefit from using bitcoin in this case (as the OP mentions).
You seem to be forgetting that cash has 0 transaction fee at all, yet you never get a discount for paying with it. It's because the total fees the seller pays really is minuscule (not over 2% that's for sure).
You're also neglecting the current state: Item normally costs 100. In response to 2% transaction fee The seller charges 102. The buyer pays 102. The buyer gets the 100 dollar product + 1 unit cashback. Instead of paying 100 for the product, they pay 101. **You're not going to break into a market with a ton of momentum with promises of 1% or even 2% savings for switching to an entirely new system, currency and method of paying.**

The kind that wants people to pay the fee in the future? Is it cool if I sign up for auto-insurance after I crashed my car? But but but I'm a paying customer! Surely no business would operate that way? Oh wait, all of them do. **In case you forgot Crassus, the richest man in the world (and throughout all of history arguably) didn't accept the fee, he offered to buy the house outright for a pittance or he would let it burn down to the ground. I'm assuming you would argue that's a good thing.** Also: mises.org, what a wonderful website:  nothing like good old racism 
What are you talking about bro, your example of roads being privatized successfully is complete shit. The private roads only handle 4% of the traffic and about 50% are forest roads mainly opened for commercial purposes. About two thirds of the private roads carry less than 100 vehicles per day.[2] 4% of all traffic? seems legit. 
Pretty much all 1st world countries rely on the government to provide the vast majority of basic services like roads, street lighting, police etc. Again, the example of a private road association (sweden) shoulders a whopping 4% of traffic, and some of them are subsidized by the government. Wow. 
 US effective tax rate ~25% Switzerland effective tax rate: 18%. Wow, what a huge difference.
People are thrown in prison for not paying their bills as an absolute last resort. It's not like you accidentally overestimate a donation by 10% and land up in prison. For comparison, 38 million americans 
**Here's an idea, how about you live in a country without a tax? Alternatively, how about you go to your beloved switzerland? Oh wait, you can be imprisoned there too!**  


Darn countries! Always having these evil laws. Why isn't there a country as you describe, free from taxes or laws or prisons. What a paradise that would be. 
Here's the truth. We need taxes. It's a thing. If you don't like it, I suggest trying to find a tax-free country (if there even is one now that somalia finally wised up). 
PS: surprise, surprise. Bitcoin is taxed now. I wonder if you'll choose imprisonment, or paying a few percent of your income to support, you know, everything that makes this country habitable?

Wat. How did the value halving not effect the overall growth? Bitcoins growth has been several huge spikes (fueled purely by speculation). I'm not saying bitcoins are tulips or anything, they have a purpose. It's an interesting technology to be certain, but the growth rate of bitcoin has been COMPLETELY independent of actual increase in usage of the currency. 
 October or so it's at what, 100ish? Then in december it's at &gt;1k and now it's down to 600. Why did the value increase &gt;10 fold in a month? Because overstock accepted bitcoins AFTER the massive price spike. "accepted bitcoins" being defined as "accepted dollars that were gained from selling bitcoins" also known as something you can do right now with any retailer. If they set prices in bitcoins that would be different, but with prices changing +-10-20% weekly it just isn't a viable currency at the moment. Again, too much volatility due to speculation...
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:24:16
I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but my point was that "tying your wealth" to bitcoin doesn't increase bitcoins marketcap. 
The US dollar's marketcap is 10 trillion, not the ~125 trillion dollars of assets expressed in dollars within the united states. Bitcoins marketcap at 10 trillion would effectively replace the dollar as a currency. That's pretty damn far-fetched for the next 2 years. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:03:33
It really doesn't, simple economics. If a billion people know about bitcoin and are interested in buying it, but only at 10 dollars, that doesn't mean the price of bitcoin at 600 will change at all. 
The only thing that will change the price in bitcoin is a change in supply (mining) and a change in demand (what people think bitcoin is worth).

Why do you assume someone isn't going to track him down and break fingers until he transfers $300k in a non-reversible fairly anonymous transaction? 
This is why I'd never hold a shit-ton of money in bitcoin (&gt;100k) and is also one of the scariest aspects to bitcoin (imo). And yeah there are some "solutions" or safeguards that basically amount to "are you sure you want to?" and if someone is torturing you, you are pretty damn sure you want to. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:15:37
Yeah, but my point is that someone that accepts bitcoins directly is being equated with someone that accepts dollars exclusively. The old system was 2-3% fee, 1-2% going to VISA etc. and 1% to consumer. Now tiger direct etc. has the opportunity to still charge the same prices but keep the 1% cashback. The consumer might then think bitcoin is more expensive than using a credit card even! That's the issue I'm talking about. 
There ought to be a distinction between coinbase and accepting straight up, and the businesses ought to give at least 1% cashback.
@_date: 2014-01-19 08:40:57
Okay, so in the case where you're a small business operating exclusively online selling items of 2.50 only then I guess bitcoin is less expensive...marginally. Transaction cost with bitcoin: 11.5 cents. 
Transaction cost with  18.25 cents (with 1% cashback) vs 11.5 cents with bitcoin **So yes, the seller of online 2.50 dollar digital somethings could give you at most a 3% discount.**
**Of course Dwolla beats the snot out of both of them as the seller would pay fees of 0.00 and the buyer would also pay fees of 0.00 (only purchases above 10.00 cost a flat 25 cents).**
So in the case where you're only selling cheap digital goods (2.50) , bitcoin is slightly better than credit cards, which would matter if dwolla wasn't dramatically better than bitcoins for this purpose. 
Still waiting on a situation where bitcoin is actually cheaper than something that already exists.

If Warren Buffet had his net worth in bitcoins I think a lot of people most certainly would... It's not like you can hold a gun to his head and tell him to just give you a few billion dollars in an anonymous irreversible transaction right now.

Do you want bitcoin to gain mainstream acceptance? Since any reference to getting in early isn't relevant if you're trying to convince Joe Smith down the street to start using bitcoins. 
Point is that right now Joe Smith can pay with Visa and save 1%. That makes him think Visa is cheaper than bitcoin. It completely reverses an advantage of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:58:30
Yeah, and if everyone on this subreddit bought (and didn't sell at all since then ) at 30 bucks most people would be okay with the news. But because few people were buying a ton of bitcoins back then (hence the 30 dollar price) they're not. Most people  bought around the peak (hence it actually being a peak). Most people probably aren't too keen on the 600 dollar price relative to what they paid. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 04:40:03
 1.75%, + 13 a month my bad. Also see first sentence here:  with the caveat that with shopping you can get it down from 2% (the average) to 1.5-1.8%.
You don't have to be a very large company at all. Square isn't particularly cheap, that shouldn't be the default. 
Regardless, say you're using square because you're lazy. So, we have a coffee at 2.50, 2.75% rate means 8 cents goes to square. **0 fee per swipe means it costs .08 cents to accept the transaction.**
**Now with bitpay, the customer sends the bitcoins, spending 9 cents to send them. Bitcoin charges the coffee shop 2.5 cents to process it. So in the first case the customer spends 2.50 and the vendor receives 2.42. In the second case the customer spends 2.58 and the vendor receives 2.475. The vendor could price it 5 cents lower to compensate for the buyer's fees but it would still cost the buyer more.**
So actually while they pay less to accept your bitcoin payment, that's mostly because you already spent the 9 cents to send it. 
And what's worse, the seller doesn't even know if the payment went through until much later! So 11.5 cents to transfer 2.50 or 8 cents to transfer 2.50. **Square is cheaper! Let alone other processors. Try again.**

PSHHH 500% in 5 months? Dogecoin did 15,000% in 4 months! If bitcoin drops to 1 dollar, should people not freak out? After all, 4 years ago it was worth less than a penny! 
Objectively speaking most people got into bitcoin when the price went sky high, so for most people their bitcoins were purchased around that price. This didn't happen to me, but what if you were freaking out and telling your friends to buy bitcoins and crap around 1k, must be fun to say "well, sorry you lost a ton of money" (even more if they used mt. gox). On the upside early adopters are still rich! :D.
That's another misconception, that regular random early adopters are sitting on 10s of millions. Nope. I'm sure almost all sold out "early" (still making a ton of money) or forgot their keys. After all they were worth nothing back then and it was all for fun. Of course everyone would have held if they knew it would go to prices they are at now, but most people sold off early. I doubt the typical bitcoin user has owned any bitcoin for more than 6 months. You're referring to mythical bitcoiners, that may or may not exist. Like me shitting on people that are said their apple stock is worth a lot less because relative to when I bought it it's still a huge return. It's just dickish.

Consider that if 90% of coins were destroyed (which is absolutely insane since really we're talking about 5% at most it seems) you'd only be at 10x return. Furthermore, people are buying in based on supply and demand. If someone hoards 50% of the coins and doesn't sell then it's not in the supply curve so it doesn't influence the price. There might be some worry that the person would dump hardcore, but A: no one owns 50% of bitcoins, B: even 50% being destroyed would be nothing compared to 1000x returns.

Second of all if you live in a country with a higher income tax overseas (which is typically the case in Europe) then you don't pay any income tax! 
Again most people living abroad don't have &gt;200k household income and pay 0 tax. Most countries abroad have higher tax rates than the us (for all your circle jerking we are one of the lowest taxed 1st world nations, not the lowest but we are fairly low). 
Uk France and Germany are all higher taxes than the US and you wouldn't pay taxes in these countries. If you love Switzerland I'd encourage you to apply for citizenship and renounce your old US ties. It seems like you hate the us tax system but simultaneously don't want to be a citizen of any other country. Just funny to me is all.

Eh, if they were stolen they probably wanted to sell it fast. You won't be able to sell a huge chunk at a price a bit below the going rate and you're not losing money if you're selling someone else's shit.

The net effect is that .6% is sapped out of both the seller and the buyer. If the buyer gets 1% back he's willing to spend ~1% more in theory. 
Confirmation time is 10s of minutes though, although less pertinent for in-store purchases it matters online for sure, and matters a lot for larger purchases as well.

Yes, it's also complete crap. Do you really think prices have gone up ~2-3x compared to say 2003? (can't see exact figures because I'm not a "subscriber").
Since median household income hasn't changed much, according to these stats america's middle class would have all been plunged into destitution. As hyperbolic as bitcoin is, even you can see that has ridiculous. Someone making 50k in 2003 isn't suddenly making real world 17-25k now.

It really doesn't, simple economics. If a billion people know about bitcoin and are interested in buying it, but only at 10 dollars, that doesn't mean the price of bitcoin at 600 will change at all. 
The only thing that will change the price in bitcoin is a change in supply (mining) and a change in demand (what people think bitcoin is worth). 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:15:19
Yeah, that's still a radical assertion that if a currency gains 4% of the world they'll ignore 96% of currency and value things in bitcoin instead. 
also: valuing something in a currency doesn't increase the value of that currency. Things have a value which can be expressed as a currency, but things being expressed in that currency doesn't mean that currency is worth more, or has more buying power.
If I make a currency with 1 unit, and people decide it's worth 1 dollar...and yet I could buy hundreds of millions of items for 1 dollar, that doesn't mean that dollar is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
EDIT2: 
**The USD marketcap is 10.5 trillion (including non-paper currency), not the amount of material wealth in the US (125 trillion). For bitcoin to have a marketcap of 9.36 trillion it would have to essentially be the new dollar.**

Hmmm I've literally never had fees. Is it a minimum balance thing? I feel like there are banks that won't screw you over but maybe I'm wrong. Also: you probably don't want to put your rainy day fund etc. into bitcoins so you'll still have a bank...I guess some people pay fees on their credit card too. The 1% thing I'm talking about is super standard/intro credit cards. 
"Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card"
0 annual fee, 0 foreign transaction fee, 1.5% cashback and $100 if you spend $500 in 3 months. 
I found that on google in like 30 seconds. If your Joe is only making 30k advising him to use bitcoin is crazy. Poor people can't deal with volatility swings really. At 50k though (average for america and we'll use the same 15k for mortgage I guess) that's 35k, for a return of $525 (and for the first year an extra $100 in the first 3 months). That's significant. Furthermore to buy bitcoins with fiat you have to pay ~1% more than what you sell (due to the spread) so that's another cost. There's no interest on a credit card if you're paying it off, and credit cards do allow you to cushion a blow if an unexpected cost arises out of nowhere (sometimes life sucks) whereas bitcoins don't. That's a feature not a con imo (and I never have had to use it personally, thankfully). 
Point is Joe will say, "hey I got 500-600 bucks last year with my credit card, how much is bitcoin going to give me?". Right now all the savings is going to businesses which means more incentive for them to enter the ecosystem, but I worry that we're leaving consumers behind. 
EDIT: Maybe my experience with banks has just been unusually positive. They give shit for interest in their "savings" account but I've never been dinged by fees because I always have a good amount of money in there/don't get cards with annual fees.

**Well, for starters they don't (not generally)**. If you don't live in the US and make under ~100k (or married 195k total) you don't pay tax period. Alternatively if you make 10 mil say, and pay a higher income tax living abroad (which is often the case) you don't have to pay tax on those earnings at all, or you would at most pay the difference. However people that are a dual citizen of the US and mexico may travel back and forth, hence the reason for this whole thing.
So to answer your question, US citizens living in a non-US country don't consume a lot of resources, **which is why the average american living abroad doesn't pay any taxes at all!**

Not sure I understand your point. Are you saying that it's cool to evade taxes while using public infrastructure because they don't ask for money every time you try and use a public road? 
By living in this country you benefit from some (not all) of the services provided by the government. This includes roads/police/fire department/protection from other nation state etc. It's understood that taxes are required to provide these services. If you don't agree, you don't have to live in this country. 
It's almost like you're going into a restaurant, eating some food and then screaming "being expected to pay for a bill is theft" as the police take you away for not paying anything.
What makes me perhaps most amused by all this is that a lot of people that say taxation is theft, voluntarily live where there is a state tax, or sales tax, or property tax, or even a city tax.  There are places without all those taxes, but surprise surprise they're kind of shitty places to live. If you don't like taxes you should already be living in Alaska or Wyoming.

The price of bitcoin is based on SPECULATION. Speculation that bitcoin is undervalued at the moment, or will be valued much more in the future. 
Example: Say I think bitcoins are really worth 50 dollars in terms of actual economic use. HOWEVER, I think bitcoins will be worth 5,000 in 2 years. I believe that so strongly, that I will invest in something that I think is overvalued right now, with the belief that in the future it will be worth much more than I paid now.
The price rose something like 30000x over a year or w/e back when it first peaked at $30. That was because of speculation. Speculation doesn't mean you see 0 value in the currency necessarily, **you can speculate because you think other people will invest and drive the price up, or you believe in the technology/message behind bitcoin and think they will be worth because of economic growth/adoption.**

Let's see how your "good for" use cases measure up to the existing systems in place.


I can buy things online with my credit card, or paypal or other means (which are actually more anonymous than bitcoin, pay with cash and get a card at a gas station etc.) 


There is no risk of fraud ever with a credit card. The reason identity theft is a thing, is that you need documentation to make big withdrawals at a bank, not so with bitcoin. If your SSN is stolen then someone might try to steal your identity (you won't be liable for more than 50 dollars of charges to your credit card). If your cold storage is stolen then he/she can drain it all in seconds and you have no recourse. So if you mess up with a credit card, 50 dollars max (often times you can cancel the card before you even have to bother). If you mess up with bitcoin all your money is stolen. Another win for credit cards/USD.


Paypal has a .5% fee and completes in seconds. Bitcoin has a lower fee, yes...but you need to wait for confirmations which can be hours. Furthermore it's clear that bitcoin will be regulated (if you say you'd like to see them try, well they'll just straight up kill it if they feel like it). With regulation comes cost (small ones) so the net benefit will be ~0 (with longer waiting times). Again, current system is fine (converting bitcoin into local currencies etc. will cost far more than .5% due to buy/sell spread if you even can)


How is hoarding money an investment? It doesn't help the economy at all to give an incentive to just hoard money without investing in a business etc.


Not sure what you mean by this...what can only be done with bitcoin (LEGALLY) that you can't do with USD?


K, yeah, you can make money mining altcoins right now. Simple risk/reward. Not unlike many other investment opportunities. I wouldn't say it's remotely predictable, ROI has halved this last week alone for altcoin mining.


Okay, so you're saying in a country without internet it's cool if I send bitcoins to my friends there? If you want to send a bunch of money to someone in another country they will have a bank account.  You can send money via Xoom to india for example for free if you're sending 1k. You're saying that in the weird case that they have internet, and they don't have a bank account, and you want to send them like 10k, bitcoin is good. In that incredibly weird circumstance (I can literally not think of a single reason you'd need to send like 10k to some random person in Africa that doesn't have a bank account). Bottom line is most cases you're sending to a 1st world nation (great), 3rd world nation where they have a bank account ( great) 3rd world nation where they don't have a bank account (pretty good 2.5% with western union, not a big deal unless you're trying to send 10k+). Only in the instance of them refusing to have a bank account, having reliable internet (and a means of securing it) and sending 10k+ does it actually improve upon the current system (and **with buy/sell spreads of ~3-4%, and no reliable way to exchange to a local currency in that 3rd world country it's actually inferior**). 


Protection from fractional reserve banking is good and bad. The current system is pretty stupid, but that's mostly because of the degree of lending is out of control. Complete inability to engage in fractional reserve banking is a negative (imo) as it would be much harder to get a loan. That is potential benefit of bitcoin though, although the current system could be modified easily to address this without switching to bitcoin. It's not an inherent benefit of bitcoin. In the case of cyprus it just made some really crappy investments in greek bonds (lol). If you want interest you have to accept some risk, that's how it works. Also: basing your economy on being a local tax haven for russians with questionable business is also probably a bad idea (Regardless of bitcoins/dollars). 


This is a horrible thing for the vast majority of people by definition. The crypto-anarchy scene that dreams of not paying taxes doesn't realize that they get a hell of a lot more benefit than people with net worth &gt;100 mil that would be taking advantage of it. Furthermore it won't work as bitcoins are already taxed. The second you exchange those bitcoins into a "real" currency you have to pay taxes, or alternatively you can go to prison. 


Haha, oh yes. China is very supportive of bitcoin. "On 30 January 2014, the exchange resumed accepting yuan deposits, after further studying the PBOC statement and other rules.[4] While the PBOC prohibited banks from trading in Bitcoin, BTC China explained that they were accepting yuan into their corporate bank account, and transferring that money to their customer accounts, before it was traded for bitcoins.[4]" That sounds like a long-term solution and definitely isn't a temporary loophole. Bitcoins in China will likely be banned outright, but will probably be called good news by If you're living under a dictatorship you probably don't have money to squirrel away anyway (because if you have money you're in the ruling class, and sitting relatively pretty).


How is it more lightweight than digital dollars? How is it more transferable given that paypal transactions are faster (no confirmations) and free from paypal to paypal? How is being divisible a bonus? You could divide the dollar indefinitely, but pennies are already pretty damn useless. Transparency a big strength of bitcoin? Wasn't that the anonymous nature that was a big strength? Can't have it both ways. It's far easier to cover your tracks with bitcoin than with USD (digital). Cash is less traceable but only in small quantities (How many hundreds of millions of dollars vanished from gox?). Not even sure how it's "fair". The richest people under bitcoin are uniformly lucky, or the inventor of it (which would be ~10x richer than bill gates if bitcoins replaced the dollar). Not saying the current system is fair either though. Consistent technology? Well physical currency has you beat there by a good 800 years. VISA etc. by another 20. 
The things bitcoin was made to address have been addressed largely. It's more like "oh now I don't have to pay a .5% fee when I send money 1000 miles away instantly". There are some benefits, but slow confirmations, minimal security, too much anonymity (for mainstream acceptance) prevent it from being something really life-changing. What if the cryptocurrency was the exact opposite of anonymous? Would help a lot with fighting crime. My main issue with bitcoin is that it is right in the middle, anonymous enough that it allows for tons of organized crime, not anonymous enough compared to gas station cards etc. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:15:00
Interesting you mention the price of gas:  . Not only does the price of gas make a poor measure of inflation, it also doesn't support your argument. 6 years ago the price of gas was actually higher than it is now, before crashing randomly as the price of a single commodity is prone to do. 
For ex. the inflation rate for food has been 2.73% over the last 9 years. Nothing compared to the 70s.  Honestly I would argue moderate inflation (around 2.73% for ex.) is better for the economy than deflation. It encourages people to not leave money sitting around, but at the same time it's not like if you do you'll go bankrupt instantly. 
For some reason believes inflation is incredibly high, and that bitcoin, a currency that they also chastise people for not putting in cold storage (aka where it is useless/not helping anyone). I think there are some clear benefits to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin (small transaction fees over the internet are still reasonably high for credit cards), but **a currency with no inflation (so that holding it pretty much guarantees increase in value as GDP expands) and security concerns (so cold storage is pretty much necessary to avoid your life savings being stolen) would be catastrophic for the economy.**

Maybe in Europe, but in america you can use your credit card for a solid 2-3% and get 1% back. Most people are okay with paying another percent or two for convenience. **How much money does Overstock give you back for paying with bitcoin?** 
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:02:08
I know I am paying in fees, a bit less than 1%. Without the ability to freeze accounts, ban processors, track purchases (to identify suspicious ones and stop them automatically) how will bitcoin be able to insure their customers.
And for fees, they are lower than you might expect:  (and believe me most companies like amazon etc. either run their own processing company or have very low rates). It depends on what type of business you are (online is a bit more, but if you sell small things online you can get ones without the flat 15 cent fee). 
There are others like  but **the point is merchants can get it down to ~2% (if they bother). At that point I, the consumer, am getting 1% global cashback with my credit card. So the net fee is ~1% going to VISA.** 
In your pickpocket example I don't carry cash. I cancel my credit card and they send me a new one. Again, 0 dollars lost. I (and everyone in the real world) don't want to micromanage my hot wallets and cold wallets either, in the current system I don't have to. I can buy an 800 dollar TV and then go grocery shopping for 150 and then buy some shoes for 100. To do that I'd need $1050 in my hot wallet, which is a lot to lose in a random mugging. 
The thing is that bitcoin is what needs to adapt. The current system offers fraud protection for ~1% fee (1.75% if you use square and don't give a shit). Transactions are instant. Fraud is not the consumers responsibility. You don't need to micromanage how much is in your hot wallet. You can pay for things in around a second for many smaller purchases with a simple swipe). You don't need a long password. If anything it sounds like VISA sounds like the new technology poised to replace bitcoin.
That doesn't have to be the case though, if the issues I mentioned are addressed. Unfortunately that's not the bitcoin that everyone likes here. Bitcoins are indeed digital cash...but there's a reason we don't store our money under our mattress. There's a reason that ~75% of purchases made in person are made with debit/credit (and of course credit cards etc. are used online). **Bitcoin needs to be more than cash but on the internet. Cash is already becoming obsolete. Bitcoin needs to be cash 2.0, better than VISA for consumers etc.** Right now that's not the case, but I hope people realize that there are issues that can be addressed to make bitcoin actually mainstream. **If you want a super anonymous currency bitcoin isn't even that great, it's the worst of both worlds (too anonymous for fraud protection, not as anonymous as alternatives for buying drugs online etc.)**
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:50:38
Huh, they accept credit here (US). Debit cards also have 1% cashback though because VISA also charges similar rates to process the transaction. I think this might be a Canada vs US thing because I've never been charged more for using a credit card. 
Chipotle still doesn't give automatic cashback for paying with cash in the US though at least. Even if you're paying with debit, that costs more for them than cash. 
If stores explicitly charge you for using credit cards that does change things, but in the US that doesn't seem to happen really. Maybe Canada will become bitcoin capital of the world :P

er, it takes me around a second or two to type in my pin. How fast does it take you to unlock your phone? Probably around as long as it takes to type in your pin. I'm assuming you also have a password on the app. 
So password on phone + password on app, click send, type in amount + QR code + send. I guess they could encode the amount in the QR, I don't use it personally. That being said entering 2 passcodes/passwords is already slower than a swipe and 4 digits.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:20:00
And how will they cover the huge costs of fraud? In the current system they know where the charge is being made from, and by whom. With bitcoin that's not the case. As a result fraud protection is dramatically harder to automate, and you can't freeze the account it's being transferred to etc. 
They're going to cover it (if they can even cover it at all) with fees...and now another advantage of bitcoin is lost. Think about it, it's way more costly to insure someone spending bitcoin than dollars. You can revoke VISA processors if they're connected to fraud. You can automate fraud detection because you see what the purchase is for, or can track purchases and see if one is out of the ordinary. These things aren't possible with the fairly anonymous version of bitcoin, and if we're tracking purchase histories and having merchant accounts and making it not anonymous and allowing chargebacks etc. then aren't we basically re-inventing VISA?
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:20:02
Price of gas is a result largely of OPEC, not at all related to inflation. If we included the price of historic art in inflation you might see quite a lot of "inflation" because the price has gone up quite a bit. Similarly if you include prices of cell phones for ex. you'd see dramatic deflation. It's not representative so they exclude it.
So the rough halving of the price was due to deflation? That's absolutely insane. It's based on price elasticity, and the fact that the price of gasoline is set by a group of individuals, not the market. 
You really think that they're not accounting for portion size? If anything portion sizes have increased historically (look at bagels 40 years ago for ex.)
"leaving money sitting around" WITHOUT investing is letting it "sit around". My point is if you have 1000 dollars worth of bit coin, the value will go up in a year if the economy expands (which it almost always does). If you have 1000 dollars you will experience a loss of 2-3%.
Inflation exists in Canada yet they don't have the same boom-bust cycles we do (partially because of regulation on the banking industry). 
People will buy things, sure, but they'll buy less. Just like inflation doesn't make everyone spend all their savings all the time, deflation doesn't cause the polar opposite. However inflation creates a small incentive to invest more, and do things with the currency while bit coin creates a small incentive to not invest, as it is an appreciating asset vs a depreciating asset.
Ah yes, a bank! Wait, wasn't that supposed to be a great feature about bitcoins? I thought we were sticking it to the bankers? In terms of security, I have seen people lambasted for not having a dedicated bit coin storage machine running linux that you compiled without connecting to the internet. Then when you want to use it, you have to bring it out of cold storage, making yourself vulnerable once again. 
Finally  so much for this vague sentiment that it will improve wealth distribution. That's far worse than regular currency. Furthermore it's pretty common to split up addresses for security reasons, so the actual distribution may be even more drastic. Those that own the most bit coin are bankers anyway, so best case scenario it's adopted and the same people own it, set up banks, buy out the network etc. There will be no "revolution" if the same people are in charge.
The people that stand most to gain from bit coin are not the people getting in now, although that's rarely talked about now. People see returns of 100x-1000x and get hopeful, like a lottery ticket. The reality is that such returns are really not possible now, 50x return would be if bitcoins replaced all dollars in circulation. That's what bothers me most, people say it's still early! Reality is that it started from .002 dollars, and is now 500,000x that. Absolute pie in the sky scenario it replaces the US dollar and increases 50x more. It is late, very late. With countries banning bitcoin (which conveniently enough wasn't mentioned on it's the end days.

Conversely, once there was a person who watched their holdings fall from $30 per coin to $20 and sold. It continued to fall until $2 at which point he bought 10x as many bitcoins as he initially had. He later sold his bitcoins for $600. Sure it wasn't the peak price of $1200 but it was a hell of a lot better than $350, and he made way more money than the guy that bought at $30 and held until now (200x return vs 12x return).

Bro tip: we might dramatically elongate life. I'm not saying go crazy, but I think it would be prudent to acknowledge the possibility instead of trying to spend all your cash by the time you're 70...
In fact I would be straight up surprised if we didn't add at least another ~10 years by 2050. Note: Unlike weird futurists I'm not clinging to the idea of eternal life.

If the CEO believes in it as much as he says he does couldn't he offer 1% more money (given that he's making that in fees) as an incentive for suppliers to switch? I just get this feeling it's a win-win-win-win for the business and a loss for the consumer (no 1% cashback/chargebacks).

Right, but the original comment was saying that if bitcoins marketcap was only 4% of the world's wealth that seems reasonable, but my point was that dollars are worth 4% of the world's wealth. It doesn't matter what you express the assets (houses/cars etc.) in. There are ~10 trillion dollars in existence (including digital) and yet ~125 trillion dollars WORTH of assets in the US. 
**It is misleading to say bitcoin would only have to be worth 4% of the world's assets because that's a shit-ton for a currency. The dollar marketcap is ~10 trillion, so for bitcoins to go to ~10 trillion in marketcap that's pretty damn optimistic.** If 100 trillion dollars worth of assets are EXPRESSED in bitcoin that doesn't mean anything for bitcoins marketcap.

My problem is that if most people keep Bitcoin as a store of value, it's not that great of a currency. The point of a currency isn't to permanently store value, or even appreciate over time. The point of a currency is to serve as a medium of exchange for different goods and services. 
People generally see bitcoin as a long-term investment, rarely spending it. That's not the point of a currency...That was my point. **There are plenty of other stores of value which COULD be used as a currency, but their primary purpose is a store of value.**

Paypal freezing your account is not the government. At all. That's like saying coin base freezing your account is a fault of bitcoin. If your BANK account is frozen, that is always done by the government, and it is not done lightly. If you think every day the government is freezing someone's account because they didn't fill out a form correctly you're clearly paranoid. The government isn't freezing accounts out of spite, and if you think they couldn't regulate bitcoin you're sadly mistaken. 
If bitcoin was banned in the US tomorrow, would it survive? Not in anything close to the capacity it is now. Keep in mind there are already "cash cards" at gas stations that exist pretty much exclusively as an anonymous payment option (just with higher fees than bitcoin) so the only thing bitcoin would be left for is drugs. Not exactly a solid foundation for a currency.

Here's what you get right now using bitcoin: 
1. **Maybe 1% savings.** The reason is that pretty much all businesses pay 2% or less for VISA, and services like coinbase charge 1%.  This all depends on them bothering to give you the savings, which they pretty much never do for cash (I've only seen this for gas).
1. **Pseudo-anonymity** (this may change in the future, but right now it's not particularly anonymous if you're not being overly paranoid.)
Here's what you lose: 
1. **Consumer protection** (chargebacks)
1. **Recourse if someone steals your wallet**
1. **Convenience** (accepted pretty much everywhere, transactions are pretty much instant)
1. **Rewards** (which are essentially equal to how much you might hope to get back from the vendor if you were using bitcoin)
1. **Not having to care about security.** People are literally blamed for using Windows and being hacked. Imagine if your bank blamed you for walking in a bad neighborhood if your wallet was stolen, or not taking proper precautions like leaving your credit card with a higher limit in a safe at home, and carrying a very low limit card around town. 
How much you value your time really plays into this.  If I value my time at 50 dollars an hour, setting up linux and buying a hardware wallet and worrying about not carrying too much in my "hot wallet" as opposed to cold storage etc. is hundreds and hundreds of dollars. 
In my mind Bitcoin isn't even being used as a true currency until the prices of goods are not based on the dollar. Overstock doesn't accept bitcoins, they accept dollars. It's also telling that they haven't reported revenues beyond the first day. Bitcoin has become a speculator's dream, and until that changes (more transactions) and the above issues are addressed it can't achieve mainstream acceptance. Uncomfortable but true.

It gets a bit tricky in terms of what you consider wealth stored in gold. ~50% of gold (apparently) is stored in jewellery, but a wedding band doesn't really seem like a financial investment to me. 
**That 8 trillion figure is all gold ever mined.**  **All the gold holdings multiplied by ~45 million per tonne appears to be 1.4 trillion.** 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this means if there were a 1000x return all bitcoins would be worth ~6-7x as much as all gold holdings...

Why? Anyone can represent their assets in any currency they choose. It doesn't increase the value of that currency by doing so...If I print one Derp Dollar and say my house is worth 1 million Derp Dollars then the value of that Derp Dollar doesn't change...
If people say their house is worth X amount of bitcoin the value of bitcoin similarly does not change.

I don't experience fees because I pay everything and have 0 debt. 100k in spending is an extra thousand a year. Granted, the prices are inflated because the merchant has these extra fees which go to Visa, but without a discount to pay in cash (which is very rarely available) or bitcoin...I don't have an incentive to switch. 
As a rationale consumer it makes more sense to pay with a credit card since credit card price is universal. If the credit card price wasn't universal I'd switch, see? 
Joe schmoe gets 1% rebate and says "awww yeah "free" flight to see Grandma" and remembers to use his frequent flyer credit card etc. If bitcoin means no more "free" flights then he is going to be disappointed if he's not getting any cashback and conclude (rightfully) that bitcoin is more expensive than Visa. 
Unfortunately the only reason that bitcoin is more expensive is because of Visa's fees that the merchant has to cover. Hopefully I got what I was saying across.

This really isn't that complicated. **The law makes it so that you are not taxed beyond what you would be taxed in the US**. There is also a chance that you would pay less taxes overall since you are only taxed according to the country you reside in under 100k for single adult, 200k for married couple.
As a result, **MOST PEOPLE LIVING ABROAD MAKE UNDER 100/200K AND AS A RESULT DO NOT PAY ANY TAXES TO THE US.**
Taxes ALWAYS are about taking money from people and spending it on things that are good for society, not necessarily on things that provide maximum benefit for the individual person. 
Yes, if you want you can indeed avail yourself of the benefits the US provides. You can renounce your citizenship, and honestly I hope you do because you clearly disagree fundamentally with the way 1st world countries are run. That's fine, but I think your tone might change if you live in these "lower tax rate" countries. Also: most other the other countries that have "lower" tax rates have things like VAT, or wealth taxes etc. 
I don't have kids, and my taxes going to education don't benefit me directly in any way. That said, having education instead of a roaming band of youth that were rejected from society and want to take what they want seems like a good solution. Again, somalia has no income tax. You should check it out, looks like a great place to live. No taxes going to things like police/roads, but who needs those anyway? Just hire bodyguards and drive a hummer.
In all seriousness I don't see the issue here. **Hate paying US taxes on income &gt;100/200k while living abroad? Renounce your citizenship. Problem solved.**

due to inflation?! Inflation rate has been ~1-2% for a while now. This isn't the 70s. EDIT: may I remind everyone that the original comment said a ~75% raise may have been due to inflation. 
Finally: here is the inflation rate for food and energy (not included in the "core" price index):  1.1% for food and .5% for energy! Again, this is not the 70s, inflation is NOT a huge factor today (that may change in the future, and one nice thing about bitcoin is that it prevents stratospheric inflation rates).

That's just because he felt like giving you a discount. As I mentioned above there are plenty of credit card processing solutions around 2% or less (larger you are, the better rate you get). The difference between bitcoin and credit card processing fees is 1% or less. 
Right, chargebacks cost merchants money, but usually when the merchant screws up. The lack of any buyer protection is a negative for the consumer.

Or they just don't see the reason to. There's no risk in accepting dollars, but you do have to add a button to your checkout page. That's not a risk, that's just exerting some slight effort. 
I guess you could say it's like ~20 bucks to pay some dude to add it to the checkout page, but it's not like they're putting it all on the line for the glory of bitcoin. They don't have to change anything else, they're still paid in dollars. Nothing changes but adding a button. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:59:30
Hmm, but if someone buys something for 5 bucks the fees are then ~2%, not too far off credit cards is what I was getting at (at least in the US). 2% really just isn't that much, I don't think retailers are losing sleep over it really. 
At least in the US it is ~2% to process credit cards in retail, and half of that goes back to the consumer anyway. So, the net result is that 1% goes to VISA/credit card processing companies and in return they provide customer service/fraud protection/convenience/transferring money around. I don't really see this as a problem personally. I'm far more frustrated at telcoms etc. than VISA.

I don't know of a single store that give 1% back automatically, but I'm sure one of them out there does. Can you name a single nationwide store with significant retail presence that does? 
Overstock.com, by far the largest store accepting bitcoin (more accurately accepting dollars imo), gives 0 discount for paying in bitcoin. 
You're arguing that some store out there will give you a 1% discount. I'm arguing that while I'm sure one random small store out there will, the vast majority (aka mcdonalds, target, walmart, gamestop, j crew, ralph lauren, trader joes, whole foods, chipotle etc.) will not. 
In practice I will save far more than you paying with 1% cashback credit card compared to you paying in cash (unless you're buying a car every week, since dealers/gas stations are the only ones I know of that actually give discounts for paying in cash...usually unadvertised/non-automatic though).

also: valuing something in a currency doesn't increase the value of that currency.

Right, but the hostility this subreddit exhibits to any criticism of bitcoin (see how much that comment was down voted) makes me think that bitcoin is destined to continue not being mainstream. 
If people were saying dial up modems were fine, and being angry at people talking about their speed then we wouldn't have what we have today. 
These are issues, and they can be changed, but if people continue plugging their ears and claiming that they're not issues they won't be changed.

How is tiger direct taking a risk? From their point of view they accept dollars (not bitcoins) from bitpay. They are immune to chargebacks. They get to save a percent or two (and pass none of this onto the consumer). 
What would actually be a risk/something to "support": Price products in actual bitcoins. Accept actual bitcoins. Use those bitcoins for other things (like suppliers potentially). Accept exchange rate variance. Give ~1-2% cashback to the consumer if they're paying with bitcoin.

Beanie babies also had value? Just because there is some value, doesn't mean that the price is largely dependent on speculation.
There can be no argument that the bitcoin ecosystem today is way better than it was back in december, yet the price is around half. That is bubble behavior. It doesn't mean bitcoin is worthless, it just means that bitcoin's price is influenced by speculation more than ecosystem health/development. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:37:52
I agree that bitcoin is different than beanie babies, but both had rapid price increases based purely on speculation. Didn't it reach peak value before Overstock even accepted the stuff? Before ATMs even started to actually be available in more than 1 location in Canada or w/e? 
**Objectively speaking the bitcoin ecosystem is much more developed now than in december. It's also half the price. That's what he's talking about, that the price is not fixed to the actual utility of bitcoin.**
I wouldn't go as far as he did and say bitcoins are beanie babies, but it is true that the price of bitcoin is not based on the health/strength of the bitcoin ecosystem.

Marketcap of a company =/= marketcap of a currency. The company is a thing, which can be bought with any currency (euros etc.) **Marketcap is kind of a dumb way to think about currency, including bitcoin, but is used in the case of bitcoin since it is more analogous to a stock atm (as an investment instead of a currency)**. Still, if you were going to find the marketcap of USD, it would be easy to do. There are 10.5 trillion dollars in existence (paper or digital). Each of those is worth 1 dollar, right? So the marketcap (or total value of the currency) is 10.5 trillion. 
There are 12.5 million bitcoins, each valued at ~$620 meaning total value can be expressed as 7.75 billion dollars. You could also express the total value of USD as 7.58 billion euros and the total value of bitcoins as 5.6 billion euros. Makes no difference. 
**The total household assets in the united states is WORTH $57.4 trillion, but that doesn't mean there are 57.4 trillion dollars in existence. Just like the market cap of the NYSE may be worth 16.6 trillion, but there aren't enough dollars to purchase it directly.** The value of THINGS(companies/cars/stock/buildings/houses/boats) in the united states is well over 50 trillion, but the value of all DOLLARS in existence is dramatically less.

Nah but foil actually does apparently work sufficiently well. If someone was stealing bitcoins (in the future) 20 bucks of tin foil to build a ghetto faraday cage in an old bathroom could be a thing I imagine. Can wrap it up during the mugging and then unwrap it in the bathroom. 
Currently people use the foil thing to steal shit from stores.

What is a proper backup procedure? Since ransomware can encrypt anything it has access to, over the network or locally attached. If you want to backup 5TB of data, you can do it locally for ~200, or online for thousands. If you need high throughout access online is no longer an option. 
For most people backing up is done locally via an external hard drive and in this case that does nothing, as the hard drive will be encrypted too.
