I just purchased several items through Blizzard and would have much rather used BTC than my debit card.

Looks like I will never be using this site, simply for the fact that you *require* a Facebook login.  I hate Facebook &amp; will never make one, especially as a method to get into your website.

Very valid point.  But it doesn't cover the issue of the US Gov banning banks from funding USD into exchanges for BTC.

"VERY fast - 
The entire exchange is coded in C++, with the entire site cached in RAM. No PHP, PERL, JAVA or PYTHON. 100% custom C++ code. The downside is it may not look as pretty. :)"
Lol...What does the backend language have anything to do with the frontend interface?  And why is that a positive thing to not use anything except C++?

Because there are definitively people willing to spent their BTC at github, giving further credibility to the currency.  What exactly is the downside to accepting it?

If I'm thinking of investing like blackjack, then yes, I could 'surrender' and not take a complete loss, which is a viable call on certain hands.

It's not Chrome.  Those navbar tabs actually don't link to anything.
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:08:27
Seems like it, because there is no href attribute for the anchor tags in the navbar except for the blog page.  I'm guessing this is because he is using the "all of the content on one page" site style where the navbar tabs bring you to the correct content lower down on the page.  I actually like that style of sites, but I'm not sure why it's not handling my clicks correctly.  Running Chrome.

Global government?  No thank you.

One more reason I love btc-e.

Finally, something I can say that yelp did right.
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:03:31
BTC-e has a few 3rd party options to acquire BTC.  Not sure if they will work in Pakistan, though.

LOL I've never heard of this, cracked me up.  But on a serious note, this is bigger than LTC getting Huobi... TO d MOON!
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:29:49
So insecure.  Rofl.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:24:07
I would just deposit into an exchange and if you really need to, then make a couple transactions.  The fee shouldn't be more than the high amount that tumblers cost to use anyways.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:38:48
Just logged in.  All were stolen.  :(
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:49:42
I like what I'm seeing.
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:45:36
Nice icons thanks for the giveaway.
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:38:54
I'll see what I can do with the scripts.  They sound easy.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:58:57
I would've flagged the transaction too then.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:13:10
I vote no.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:40:05
Awesome!  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:27:50
Yeah no thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:49:29
Awesome, this is great work you do!

"Or we could, you know, not demand it and continue to allow weak hand exchanges get mysteriously hacked or lose private keys whenever the price starts to fall drastically."
Ah, the same thing that was said after Gox.

Soylent sucks.
