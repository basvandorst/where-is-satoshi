BoA blocked a coinbase transaction of mine back in 2013.

Yes, I’d argue that if you bought for anything above $2500 you should not be blindly holding, I mean, in the long term it will still pay off, in my opinion, but you can increase your stack by an incredible multiplier if you simply trade the market using the most conservative indicators.

Not really, most of it is conjecture and storylines made up based on mistranslation and hyperbole. The positive news for the space still far outweighs the negative.

It’s okay if you think that, but I disagree. BTC user since 2013 and I have nothing but optimism for the space. Are there problems in crypto? Absolutely, huge problems. But I still believe it’s the future. Willing to be wrong.
EDIT: I am legitimately worried about tether. That could be mt. gox 2.0 for sure.

Same. I tried to tell people that it was a scam, they wouldn’t listen. I’m talking about people I know IRL, they just couldn’t be convinced. I empathize but I don’t sympathize. They were greedy and reckless and got what they deserved, I’m sorry. 
I hope everyone that got scammed can find something in their lives to bring them peace in the wake of a big loss. But they have no one to blame but themselves and the scammers.

I’m talking about actual tech news and adoption of real cryptocurrency and blockchain. An MLM pyramid scheme isn’t FUD to me, it’s “I told you so”.

This is amazing. Someone in their marketing department stopped giving a fuck.

Same. My last purchase was at 4500, been waiting for this correction since November.

Depends where in the US also. Where I live $1.5M of net worth would land you somewhere in the upper-middle/lower-upper continuum. 
And where do you get the $100k+ per year, even if all of that was in a 5% dividend stock, you're still only around $50k net income from that annually.

Don't leave us hanging, man...

So that’s who took that plate, lol.

I’m still waiting for my FFVII remake I was promised a decade ago.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:22:24
Yeah, me too...for the storyline.

I have an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics. I have programming experience in Java and Python.
Currently teaching myself JavaScript, angularJS, and solidity through a few different web courses out there. 
Any idea what else I’d need to do to make myself employable as a blockchain developer or something related? Any good resources for guidance?

I go nuts for donuts.

My background is in physics and pure math, now work in finance. Economics isn’t the only field where this happens. When I was in grad school, every liberal arts major had an opinion on the existential implications of quantum mechanics or some obscure aspect of cosmology or QFT because they heard Brian Greene or NdT or Michio Kaku talk about it in hand-waving terms and all of a sudden I was the one who was behind and didn’t get it.
Medicine is even worse, facebook-anti-vaccine-soccer-moms are the first example that comes to mind.
Every single field attracts charlatans, economics is just one of many fields that fall victim to snake-oil and pseudo-science.

Quantum spin is just a notational method of attributing properties of intrinsic angular momentum/magnetic moment, things that are related to rotation and spinning. That intrinsic angular momentum can be modeled by a small loop of charge spinning, which effects a magnetic moment in the analogy.
How’d I do for a 30 second explanation of spin number?
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:30:17
Yeah, I hate the magnets meme because anyone with an undergrad in physics (and likely chemistry) could give you a decent explanation that isn’t overwhelming. Also quantum spin isn’t too abstract of a concept to explain to a layman: Quantum spin is just a notational method of attributing properties of intrinsic angular momentum/magnetic moment, things that are related to rotation and spinning. That intrinsic angular momentum can be modeled by a small loop of charge spinning, which effects a magnetic moment in the analogy.
