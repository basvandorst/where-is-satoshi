What it means is that half the transactions in the mempool are larger than that. There’s 250+ blocks worth of transactions now. Assume everything below the median is one of your micro transactions and you still have nearly a day’s worth of blocks in the mempool.

The difference with mining is that a miner doesn’t relay a transaction. It updates a centralized ledger. 
A Lightning node is relaying the transaction in ways that fit money transmission definitions in the US.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:04:13
Are you sure? I hear all the time that LN is trustless. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:35:02
The sender actually transfers the ownership. The miner just updates the records. 
I’m not trying to just play with words though. Is FinCEN? Maybe. They’ll do whatever suits them though. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:37:26
On main chain, I transfer to you. Miner updates central ledger. 
In lightning, I transfer through up to 20 hops who each update their channel ledgers to relay value to next hop and then it comes to you and updates your channel.

I’ll just give my Uncle Phil the money when I see him next weekend. 
I’m more concerned about getting my payment to the merchants who will only open channels to a compliant provider, like my favorite coffee shop or online super store. 
Turns out they use the same KYC/AML institution as my Uncle Phil, but he says he won’t route any of my payments because all he has is that one KYC/AML channel (he couldn’t find a reason to open more than one) and since I do some black market purchases he’s afraid that a payment from me might be for some of those illegal drugs or something. He had to agree to a bunch monitoring and tracking stuff in the small print of his exchange’s channel contract and doesn’t want the risk of my potentially dirty payment somehow coming back on him. He’s not a cryptographer or programmer so he doesn’t know about all that onion routing stuff. He’s just pretty sure that the government can track everything after seeing Snowden on 60 minutes. 
So now I can’t get my payment into the KYC/AML hubs that all my favorite merchants are on. I guess I’ll just have to accept the KYC/AML requirements and open a compliant channel. But, I’m going to have to drop my channel with you, because I know about your Silk Road purchases and I don’t want to risk losing my ability to buy coffee and kindles.

Can you cite a source for Lightning transactions being sent as fragments? I’ve never seen this mentioned before. If I understand you correctly, a channel opened with .01 BTC could relay a 1 BTC transaction. Is that documented anywhere?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:31:06
I read your article when you posted it here a couple weeks back. I asked you then to cite a source for your claim that LN splits up transactions like you describe. You didn't respond then. 
Now you say it is in the RFC. Please provide the specific BOLT that specifies this behavior because I haven't seen it in BOLTs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. 
Everything I read about routing a transaction speaks of only one route and nowhere, besides your comments on reddit, does anyone indicate that there is some sort of automatic splitting by sender and reconstructing of transactions by a receiver. 
You keep thinking in the terms of TCP/IP and not in the terms of financial transactions. Lightning isn't an IP routing network; it is a transaction routing network. 
Please cite a BOLT or statement from a Lightning (lnd), Blockstream (c-lightning), or Acinq (eclair) Dev that backs up your assertion.

Median BTC transaction size is over $2000. Max possible LN tx size is less than $500. You aren’t getting a bunch of small transactions off the Blockchain that aren’t already not there. So it’s not going to do anything to fees on the Blockchain.

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:57:50
They know amount, time, previous hop and next hop. If your merchant is on the same exchange as you, they know what you sent to whom and when. If your merchant is on another exchange that has a channel to your exchange (because why wouldn’t they?) then your exchange can coordinate with your merchants exchange to know (or report) how much you sent to the other exchange and when. The other exchange knows how much came from your exchange to their merchant channel and when. Reconstructing that path for reporting purposes is easy. 
And the institution can just include a clause in their channel opening contract that stipulates you don’t route from other channels... you know, for KYC/AML compliance. Violation of the contract terms will result in termination of the channel. For 99% of the world... why risk it?
Liquidity and connectivity in the “nefarious” side of the network will likely be constrained by neither merchant mor consumer wanting to keep channels open longer than required to conduct a transaction. At that point, just send a raw on-chain transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:20:46
It gets better: Read pages 16-17 of the LN WP on the topic of Timestop. And then imagine a world where the mempool has over 24 hours of fee-attached transactions forever, i.e. current reality and most likely reality under LN v1. nSequence will never increment.

They don’t know if the payment originated from the sender or terminates with the receiver. This makes it not compliant with KYC/AML.

Sure, no worries. Ultimately, the regulating bodies and governments are the main threat to bitcoin. More so than altcoins or forks. And the regulating bodies are more deceptive and dishonest than those things as well. 
I have a worry (go ahead and stop reading if you think I’m concern-trolling) that LN will open up a new round of regulatory review that might result in reclassification of miners and maybe full nodes. That is, if they make a case that what LN does results in money transmission, and with collected fees is a money transmission business, it’s not a far stretch to argue that full nodes are relaying as money transmitters and miners as MTBs. The counter argument will be about custody, but I don’t think the regulators will see much distinction. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:13:38
Ideology aside it’s probably a good idea to hold onto forked coins for at least one broad crypto bull run. I had ETH pre-ETC. After the DAO fiasco I sold off both my ETH (I lost faith in the immutability) and ETC (free money!) for like $10 and $1 respectively. ETH went on to $1,300 and ETC to almost $50. I was an initial investor in ETH, so you can make a guess at my lost potential value. 
Unless you were able to sell BCH in the few minutes it was above $3,000 it’s probably best to just ignore it for now. Same for BSV, BTG and so on. Likewise, the BCH-proponents who don’t “believe” in BTC anymore should probably have held onto their pre-fork BTC. The next major bull run will likely move up close to 30x from the previous ATH based on trends since at least 2011. Similar growth should be seen across the board and will likely present a good opportunity to exit any coins you came into through various forks.

But we do know that neither amount could be sent through LN. Best case it would take 11 Lightning transactions to send the smaller amount. :/

Deflationary periods existed that offset inflationary periods well into the mid-20th century. It’s more likely that Bretton Woods and the subsequent removal of the gold standard had a larger impact on the death of deflation than the Fed. If the last decade has shown anything it’s that the Fed has very limited abilities to create inflation.

If you look at the numbers though, most student loan balances are not that high. ~30 million of those carrying student loans owe less than $25k. Those with balances above $25k are roughly 20 million. And all but 2.5 million of those owe less than $100k. The majority of student loan debt is a very manageable $25k and is not enough to disqualify most people from getting a mortgage they can manage. By 35, the average US employee is making $50k. If they have a $333/mo student loan payment they will have no trouble getting a $200k mortgage and paying it off. They aren’t getting anything in California at that price, but outside that hell hole they can get a good starter home all day long.

You’re missing the point. 10 years ago there were only 30 million millennials in the workforce. Today there are close to 60 million. Half of those have now been in the workforce for 10 years and are establishing themselves in careers and earning more income. A 34 year old who has 10 years experience in a field is worth more than a 24 year old recent grad. They are forming households and buying houses. 10 years ago 30 million of them were making literally nothing. Today they are making something. 10 years from now they’ll be making more and forming households. Those with 20 years in will be the mid/upper managers and making actual money (they don’t let you make actual money until you are 40). And the post-millennial generation is coming up into the workforce too without a global financial crisis hitting them. All of these factors are going to keep pushing demand for housing to the right and, by the way, pushing millennial incomes higher.

There’s a demographics change to consider. The 2008 bust in real estate coincided with a bunch of boomers becoming empty nesters and downsizing with no good household formation yet occurring among millennials and Xers being a smaller cohort with all the house they needed thanks. 10 years on, millennials are doing a lot more household formation and moving toward peak earning years. And that leads to buying houses. They have a demographic size similar to boomers so demand has shifted considerably to the right. Instances of subprime and gotcha loans, while occurring, are much more the exception than the rule.

No. The exchange value of the coins will rise as the production rate decreases. And when production ends in 2140, if Bitcoin is still a thing, the volume of transactions will be so great that the fees will be worth mining for. 
There is another problem with trying to predict what the world will be like in 125 years. I daresay that people in 1890 didn't even have words to describe the mundane things of today's world.

You hire protection services for your private property. An inordinate amount of violent crime is caused by the government’s war on drugs. And that exists precisely because no one has to directly pay for it. Remove the government’s monopoly control on protection services and firms driven by profit optimization will look for ways to provide the limited required services for their fees. This will incentivize innovation in protection services and to not overprovide services (like the war on drugs) that produce negative externalities such as generations of imprisoned fathers in the black community. That right there will increase the amount of peace kept over the current government monopoly.

A parabolic rise will come. Probably into the 20k range. And then it will crash, but that crash will be back into the $2k-$4k range which is still up over 300% from the start of the rally.

Previous crashes have come related to the existing trading infrastructure not being prepared for the massive increase in activity generated by the price increase. I expect the same to happen again. Profit taking will lead to millions of USD trying to leave Coinbase and others daily and we'll discover like with previous exchanges that they aren't quite capitalized for it and they will halt all withdrawals which will start a panic as people fear that it may be insolvent. 250k FDIC doesn't cover very much Bitcoin at $20k/BTC. Panic leads to selling leads to more panic. Rinse and repeat. 
It was exchange failure that caused the crash from $30 and the crash from $1000. Coinbase isn't remarkably different than mtgox fundamentally.

@_date: 2019-02-23 07:58:34
LN nodes aren’t doing the routing. They are providing liquidity. That is, they are lending their money to collect fees. The more money they can lend to the network the more fees they can collect. Unlike mining which is actually securing the network through work and not extracting fees, but rather being compensated through block rewards. All current transaction fees are a result of the design being broken through retention of an unnecessary and arbitrary blocksize cap. The need for fees should not have materialized until the final block reward was received in 2140.

Lower highs in these pops up followed by lower lows. I wouldn’t say sub 3k is out of the question until we stop trending down. If we retake 4k the sub 3k story gets less likely. If we retake 5k, even less.  When we break 6k, the sub 3k likelihood approaches zero.

I was referring to the fees to send the bitcoin to the exchange. I recently did this with a small amount. Sent with the slowest fee recommended by the wallet and it took 12 hours for the first confirmation and another hour for the 6 confirmations the exchange requires.
Had I paid a non-trivial fee, I could have moved coins quicker to the exchange and panic sold. 
But yeah, limit sells tend to have better fee structures than market orders on exchanges.

But now it’s perfectly acceptable to expect LN nodes to front $50,000 to $100,000 in order to compete in the fee marketplace of the LN. But it is still somehow totes decentralized. Rube Goldberg would be so jelly right now.

The barriers to entry aren’t near 0 though. OP has $50,000+ sitting in channels. If you want to compete at his level you’ll need to fund channels for $50,000+ also. If you want to out compete him you’ll need to have more than that in channels. It’s the definition of rent-seeking.
“BREAKING DOWN Rent-Seeking
According to Adam Smith, individuals and businesses can earn income from three sources: profit, wages and rent. Generating profit usually requires risking capital in the hope of a return while earning wages tends to be labor-intensive. Rent is the easiest and least risky type of income because it requires only resource ownership and the ability to use those resources to generate income by lending their use to others. Because rent income implies less risk or work than other types of income, individuals and companies seek to earn this income whenever possible. Rent-seeking becomes a problem when entities engage in the practice to increase their share of the economic pie without increasing the size of the pie.”

This raises a corollary question relative to the level of security that is required to be secure “enough”. For instance the current hashrate on BTC more than double what it was when the exchange rate of BTC was pushing $20k. The dollar value of all BTC then was 4x higher but the hashrate was 1/2 of what it is now. So was the security then insecure? Or was that sufficient for the value secured then and we are just way over secured now?

For BTC to be useful as THE global currency, 1 BTC will have to be worth around $4 million. Currently global broad money supply is around $90 trillion and there won’t be more than 21 million bitcoin. Math. 
At that goal, the block reward is still around $25k after 11 more halvenings in 40-some years. Fees of a couple cents per transaction with 500k transactions per block will make mining still very attractive.

Difference is miners can add blocks to the chain. As long as other miners build on top of that block the only thing non-mining nodes can do is cut themselves off from the network.

It would probably be more precise for him to say that the amount of friction involved in currency use for the average person has increased leading to them not considering it a viable alternative to existing state currencies. Meanwhile, the amount of proponents who have emphasized hodl over currency use has increased leading to the overall impression by the general public that it is primarily a speculative asset rather than a currency.

You are correct about this being a reason to mine over buy. You really pay for that anonymity though. I mined in 2011 and for the cost of mining I could have gotten 3x more bitcoin by just buying with the funds I spent on gpus and electricity. 
In the current regulatory regime, buying through an exchange helps establish a cost basis for calculation of capital gains, which is a little more complicated for mined coins.

Not close to true. CPU mining was dead long before the 2011 crash. I was GPU mining with 11 cards on 3 custom built machines during the 2011 crash. FPGA mining was starting to roll out as the crash bottomed out and the first ASICS were being unveiled. Very few people left their GPUs running as the electricity use was huge. The difficulty adjusted down, and miners with a longer time preference continued to mine and those with more efficient technology entered the market. The same will happen now. That’s how the system was designed.

You have no basis for not thinking so. In 2011, you could pick up 100 coins for $1,000. That would put you in the top .1% of bitcoin addresses.

Really good analysis. Only points I see differently is that 2011 was a bubble from $1 to $30 not $.05. But not a big deal here really. 
I’ll give it to $3,000 as that’s about 85% pullback, in line with the pullback after 2013 and better than the 90%+ of 2011. 
Even if we break lower I don’t think it will be the death of bitcoin, it just might set everything back a couple years longer. Better case scenario, we don’t have the next blow off top bubble until 2024-2025.

The major previous times were actually worse than this.

We’ll start going up again by this next year. But it won’t be anything remarkable. The following 2 years will see a 20%-30% rise. Maybe 100% after that til we hit the old ATH at which point we will be setup for the next bubble.

I was burning about 37 kWh per day. I used aggressive pool hopping algorithms to maximize output and was getting between 1 and 2 BTC per day. As the price fell over the summer and into the fall, pools were shutting down and GPU miners who weren’t hopping were leaving. I finally turned them off when we got down to around. $4 and even hopping yielded only about 1 BTC. It’s not a pure calculation from electricity cost to price. It took labor hours to maintain back then.

Length between bubbles has been increasing. And there haven’t been six. There’s been 4. To $1, a few months later to $30, two years later to ~$1,000, four years later to ~$20,000. We’ll have 6-8 years from the previous top to the next top. 
Unless my thesis is wrong and bubbles come in twos with a smaller bubble like spring 2013’s spike preceding the bigger bubble. If that’s the case, then the echo bubble from 2017 should happen in 2019. If we don’t see conviction movement toward a new ATH in 2019 we are in for a longer bitcoin winter.

You are right and 11/13 is the day (bitcoinaverage has $416 for that day). What is significant is that there has never been a time in the trading history of bitcoin where holding for 2 years produced a loss. If there isn't a rally this week, that will change. Early last week we broke a nearly year long streak where holding for 1 year produced a loss. Will be interesting to see where the price goes relative to it's 1 year and 2 year hold periods.

I’m trying to find evidence that AMP is still in development. It was last discussed on the lightning-dev mailing list in December and that discussion seemed to point to some pretty tough obstacles. And the only AMP related updates in the code repo are from November. Can you point to some evidence that AMP is still being worked on? Also fwiw, it seems some of the devs have opted to go with the nomenclature of “partial payments” or something like that instead of AMP. Still, can’t find any updates on that moving forward either.

Mostly true. It definitely applies to cash transactions but FinCEN have given themselves enough latitude and left things unclear enough that they _may_ treat bitcoin as a cash equivalent.

@_date: 2019-05-13 08:56:01
I tend to agree with you but this graph is missing some datasets that present a different possible scenario. After the 2011-2013 recovery there was a small bubble that popped in March or April and then recovered in November of the same year. February 2013 hit the previous ATH of ~$30 and then went on to $250 before collapsing back to a low around $75-$80 and then stabilizing at about $100. In November it got back above $250 and ran up to ~$1200. 
Also, prior to the bubble up to $30 in June 2011 there was another run up to $1.00 with a hard correction about 6 months earlier. 
So the other scenario is that bitcoin has long recovery times to a smaller bubble (though it seems huge at the time) followed by a shorter recovery time to a much larger bubble. $1-&gt;$30, long recovery, $250-&gt;$1200, long recovery, $20,000-&gt;? 
This is definitely the more bullish scenario. My bearish scenario matches up fairly close to what you described. I think we’ll have a clearer picture of which scenario plays out in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:26:01

Ok, that article is someone writing _about_ AMP and you can probably find even more recent articles where someone describes it. There have been articles for 18 months or so where people describe the idea. It’s well established now what the intention is, but making it work is where I don’t see anything happening. The discussion on the mailing list just demonstrates that every idea people put forward goes nowhere (because routing at any scale is still unsolved). Maybe Trampoline will be the solution that enables further movement on partial payments (but it’s way too early to even guess at its viability). 
And that tweet is just a semantics play. It doesn’t mean what you are suggesting it does.
Considering the additional article you added from today, I guess I’ll check back in 18 months and see how things are going.

There’s a fundamental disconnect related to LN as a scaling solution. When the blocks hit capacity last year the median transaction size was some thousands of dollars. Micro-transactions weren’t even a factor in blocks getting full, mempool clogging and fees skyrocketing. But LN is sold as a layer for micro-transactions. LN provides scaling for a type of transaction that doesn’t even contribute to current problems of scaling. 
Larger transactions aren’t even supported on LN. Lightning limits each channel to 0.16777216 Bitcoin. Likewise 0.04194304 Bitcoin are allowed for a single transaction. These are temporary limits but after a year on mainnet, they are still there. And the reason they are still there is that the risk of funds loss to bugs is non-trivial. That is to say: the devs are responsibly trying to limit people from bigger losses which is laudable but reveals how unready LN really is for the task of scaling Bitcoin.
There is potential for LN to provide an interesting second layer, anonymizing payment network, especially once partial payments are figured out (this looks a ways off from reading the Lightning-Dev ml). But the dependence on it as THE solution to scaling seems like an entirely too risky proposition. (inb4 batching, segwit, liquid which also don’t provide real solutions to scaling qua scaling). 
This remains a blind spot for bitcoin. I don’t think people will accept browbeating into LN when bitcoin inevitably becomes popular with investors again. Hopefully real scaling solutions will be entertained before that happens.

Yeah, someone else asked me about this also. I don’t think the bubbles are directly tied to halvings. We had meaningful bubbles before the first halving. If they are tightly connected, it seems like the distance between the halving and the new fomo top is expanding. After the 2012 halving it was about 12 months to the new fomo top. After 2016 it was nearly 18 months. A 50% increase in distance from halving. So overlaying that, I’d look for a new fomo top nearly 27 months after halving: Q3 2022. That seems rushed to me after the 2017 bubble. But it would fit a more optimistic model. I lean more toward pessimism with pleasant surprises.

What you are looking for is an electricity provider that will accept payment 2 years from now. I haven’t mined for 7 years but when I did, the exchange rate at the time was just barely break even for the electricity cost. 2 years later though....
Also, you need to understand that if you are going to mine, you are doing it as a labor of love or a fun project. The amount you spend on mining hardware and electricity will yield much less bitcoin than just taking that amount and buying it. I personally ended up with 1/3 the amount of bitcoin I could have had if I had just spent the money buying instead of mining.

That sounds reasonable. I think we’ll either see bottom in January or out in 3rd quarter depending on the model. If it’s January, I expect we will have a modest gain by year end 2019 (20-50%).

Just off the top of my head, if the US policy is to ban bitcoin, it automatically becomes attractive to other nation states to endorse it. In response to a US ban I can easily imagine Russia making it an officially recognized currency and preferred settlement vehicle for trade with the other BRICS. It’s no secret they are all looking for a way to de-dollarize the world economies. If the US is clearly against bitcoin, it strengthens their reasons to be for it as a means to undermine the strength of the dollar.

From a trading view, Bitcoin needs to be viewed as a foreign currency. If the Fed goes through with their 25 bp raise today, it will mean a stronger dollar which would be price bearish for foreign currencies, and equities. Bitcoin as a system doesn’t need low rate loans, but many of the buyers of Bitcoin do. A move up in Fed rates shouldn’t be viewed as bullish for Bitcoin. 
But Bitcoin often ignores what it should be doing given any particular market conditions.

So I want to do something as trivial as buying my weekly groceries with LN. I have a large family and the weekly Costco grocery run usually comes out to $200.

It can be changed. My question is about right now. There are lots of posts touting the growth of LN, but it is still very limited as far as use goes and doesn’t address the concern it was sold as addressing: scaling.

Typical garbage reporting we’ve all seen since 2011 or so. But he does make one good point:
“While the original buyers and miners of bitcoin were true believers in the paradigm shift they thought it promised, and were willing to make the necessary investments for future gains, the more recent buyers and miners have been run-of-the-mill, greed-driven investors.”
It’s those original buyers and miners of bitcoin that have always provided (and will still provide) the solid floor under bitcoin.

The last 10 years Gold has returned 49% while the S&amp;P has returned 200%. And the “next financial crisis” was just around the corner the whole time. Of course bitcoin has destroyed both of these. 
I have both gold and bitcoin. But for different reasons. Gold is there in the event that the global nation-state financial system collapses (and my gold hedge is small to reflect the likelihood of that happening).

HODL isn’t mutually exclusive from recouping your initial investment or taking some off the table (maybe even spedn-ing it). I’ve realized gains of 50x initial investment and still hodl the vast majority of my coins. 
Hodling is about not panic selling in crashes and also having a thesis that bitcoin will be a global currency/asset with a value of multiple 100 times what it is currently. Most Hodlers know people who panic sold and had to buy back in at higher prices. Many Hodlers WERE those people in previous bull/crash cycles.

[Per capita alcohol consumption rose to pre-prohibition levels and beyond after an early initial drop. ]( Quality wasn’t affected [except for when the government poisoned alcohol. ]( And as always happens with banned substances, the price doesn’t collapse [it skyrockets. ]( This is even more true in the case of drugs. I lived in Washington State when pot was legalized. The quality available at legal establishments was worse but the prices fell across the board. Prices were higher when illegal. And look at Gold when it was criminalized to hold in 1934. The price was increased by nearly 75%.
The best thing the US government could do to help the price of Bitcoin is to ban its use.

Honestly, probably not much at this point. About 13,000 transactions this year have been made opening channels. But in the last 30 days it appears there have been only 15,000 channel updates (which should correspond to transactions at this point). Even if that was 15,000 per day, it’s relatively small compared to 300,000+ transactions per day on chain.

Ok, let's see how this scenario works.
Let's assume two parties: Craig and Calvin. Craig sends 1 BTC to Calvin. The tx gets mined into a block and the block is propagated. A third party, HydraGene, runs a full node. His full node receives the block and starts validating all the transactions in it. You discover that Craig used an already spent tx output in his tx to Calvin.  Oh and another block was just mined.
1) What happens to that block?
2) What happens to Craig's 1 BTC tx to Calvin?
Now let's take it a step further. You and 1,000 of your friends all run full nodes. You all discover that Craig spent an already spent tx output in his transaction to Calvin. 1) and 2) again. And now another block was just mined.  
So... what did your validation do for the network?

If my complaining about it creates social pressure for the devs to lift that cap, that benefits BTC, of which I have a lot.

@_date: 2017-06-11 02:53:13
Besides the bullet point questions the broader issue of scaling is related to decentralization. 
Apart from the asicboost and sidechain discussions above, there is the broad problem that blocks are full or filling and the number of transactions being sent can't be confirmed quickly unless high fees are paid to make the transaction attractive to miners for inclusion in the next block.
This is due to a limit on blocksize that was implemented by satoshi at one point to address a problem of transaction spam. The limit on the size of a block is 1 MB. 
To address scaling, this limit could be raised or removed. Proponents of doing this argue it fixes the problem of full blocks. Opponents of this argue it will cause the chain to become bloated with large blocks to the point that it would be prohibitive for joe-average-user to run a full node/mining node. Bigger blocks mean more hard drive space and more network bandwidth which joe-average-user can't afford to have leading to centralization of the mining network. 
Proponents of smaller blocks argue that more people will be able to run full nodes/mining nodes to keep the network decentralized and more resistant to attacks, corruption or outside influence/interference. Opponents of smaller blocks argue that by not increasing capacity the usefulness of Bitcoin is stuck and won't scale and that growth in the usage and value of Bitcoin outweighs the risks of some centralization.
Segwit was developed as a way to increase the number of transactions in a block without increasing the size of the blocks. Ideally it will provide scaling while maintaining decentralization. 
There are A LOT of secondary and tertiary components to these issues that revolve around the motivations of various opponents and proponents on both sides of the debate, but those can't really be explained like you are 5.

There’s a slight rise in confirmed transactions: 
It correlates to the pending transactions in the mempool. That’s what the mempool is: transactions pending inclusion in a block. The number of confirmed transactions is essentially capped at &lt;~600,000 per day. So analyzing the mempool is a better source for determining number of daily transactions, especially when blocks are full. If you look at this time last year. The number of confirmed daily transactions was never above ~500,000 per day. However, from the mempool we can see that there were as many as 260,000 additional transactions that were waiting for confirmation. So confirmed transaction count doesn’t give us an actual picture of how many transactions are being performed, we need to look at the mempool to see how many transactions are being attempted.

Small caveat on your advice “do it in small quantities”: if it appears you are stacking your purchases to remain under the $10,000 limit that triggers a suspicious activity report (SAR) according to FinCENs AML rules they may shut your account down. If you are doing small like $100 here or there, fine. But if you do multiple $9500 or sets of $4750 transactions it will look like stacking and probably cause you some problems. 
Everyone should become familiar with SARs and AML laws just to steer clear of inadvertently appearing to try to avoid them.

Brave of you to raise these concerns here. 
Your point about human nature is valid. It plays out like this: Amazon, Starbucks, Target, Wal-Mart, McDonalds. Netflix, Fandango etc all have risk mitigation strategies. None of them want to have exposure to millions of channels for individual users. Why tie up payments you need to settle in a timely manner. So they (the F500, and so on) will open the minimum number of channels to operate (assuming widespread adoption of bitcoin and lightning). The minimum they need is 1 with a payment processor/channel provider who will have the channel liquidity to handle daily transactions. This also gives them a single throat to choke in the event of an issue. And allows them to shift risk to the payment processor, which is worth a small fee. Handling payments for a F500 company will require huge liquidity channels. The entities that can do that will also be able to handle the medium enterprise market who will want the decreased risk exposure as well. Once the F500 and medium enterprise markets are handled by well funded channel providers, what are the chances that small enterprises won’t follow suit. Why would a small business incur the expense of opening individual channels on-chain when a processor will offer them a single low cost channel to process all their transactions. At this point, a handful of payment processors will handle the bulk of payments. Every business you want to pay will be handled by these entities so you will need to go through them at the last hop. These entities won’t allow anything to pass through them that isn’t KYC compliant, so you’ll be on a KYC channel for all your real world payments. This is how the real world works.

Well, with Segwit, batching and lightning blocks are currently 80% full in a terrible bear market. Good luck with your groceries when a bull returns.

For ease of understanding in communication it’s more beneficial to use a unit that people generally understand than one they don’t. Describing the value of BTC in dollars makes more sense than describing it in microwaves. But if you insist: 1 BTC = 32 Microwaves.

You should make the coinbase app open with your referral link to keep the flow of Bitcoin coming to your account.

A crash to $2k-$4k was completely predictable last year. It’s not disconcerting at all for anyone who’s been around for awhile.

To back up a bit. If Craig starts with 100 BTC and Calvin has 100 BTC. After Craig sends Calvin 1 BTC his balance is -1 BTC (or 99 BTC) and Calvin's is +1 BTC (or 101 BTC). If your node rejects and 1,000 other "full nodes" reject it but the majority of mining nodes accept it, your rejection is meaningless. All it does it prevent you, yourself, from accepting a tx that your node rejects as invalid. It does not do a single thing for Craig and Calvin and their transactions. 
A full node makes sense when you are receiving payments for some business purpose with a quick turn around. For example, a business that fulfills orders in less time than block confirmation occurs. If you are just hodling or only spending or can wait for 6 or 10 blocks to confirm, your need to run a full node drops dramatically. After a few blocks are confirmed, the tx is unalterable, full node or not. 
If 8 out of 10 nodes are run by a malicious party and are non-mining nodes, and the remaining 2 are mining nodes, the chain created by the 2 mining nodes will logically be the longer chain with the most accumulated proof of work (and therefore the valid chain) as soon as the next block is mined. The non-mining nodes don't mine. So they can't add transactions to a chain. They aren't building a chain. They are just sitting around with nothing further to validate.
Likewise, if 8 out of 10 mining nodes are malicious, but the remaining two have more hashrate than the 8 malicious miners, they will create the longer chain with more accumulated proof of work over time. See the recent BCH/BSV "hashwar" for a real world demonstration of this. Non-mining nodes didn't make any difference in this scenario at all. You chose what chain you wanted to follow and adjusted your node accordingly. 
The only exception to all of this (and it goes back to your original statement that it's not all black and white): If a non-mining node represents a majority or significant minority of economic power (payment gateways, exchanges, accepting merchants, etc) they can use their social power to influence the chain by pre-announcing support or rejection of consensus rule changes. This exception does not in any way apply to solo individuals running full nodes with no economic power. 
Those individuals run their full nodes for their own benefit, period. They provide nothing of value to the rest of the bitcoin network system. There's a very easy way to know this is the case... they aren't compensated for running a full node. Bitcoin is based on economic incentives (ie gettin paid) for contributing to securing the network. If you aren't getting paid through the system (via block rewards and tx fees), you aren't contributing to its security. You are just helping yourself, which is totally fine and you can extract whatever psychic value you want from that. But don't lie to yourself about contributing anything to the bitcoin network/system as a whole just because you run a full node.

$77,200 is the cap for married filing jointly. With a standard deduction of $24,000 this means a married couple could sell off up to a total gross income of $101,200. If you have children, the $2,000/child tax credit is huge in this regard. $2,000 in taxes at 15% covers about $13,333 in long term capital gains. So for each child you have, that’s $13,333 more you can sell/rebuy to raise your cost basis.
And again, talk your CPA or tax attorney.

Welcome to the community. As you can see it’s a warm and accepting place happy to help anyone with questions. 
As some have said: 2140 is when block reward runs out. By then the value of transaction fees will provide incentive for miners to keep mining. If the fees aren’t enough incentive by then, bitcoin will have long since failed.

Actually, you just check the amounts in the addresses you have in your coinbase account and you will be completely the wiser about what's in your account.

When 12.5 Bitcoin are worth $125,000 or $1.2 million  I don't think fees are going to be that big an issue still. 
If you are getting fees on qt, you need to get coin-control

If you are doing several transactions that combined are approaching $10k then it looks like stacking to them. This is the process where you try to get around the suspicious activity report they have to file for $10k transactions. 
You should set up multiple banks and spread your transactions around so no one bank gets multiple transactions that approach $10k combined. 
But that will actually be stacking, so catch-22.
