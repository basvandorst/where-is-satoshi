Thanks for the comment. Good POS system are already available. Now they have instant settlement - for every 100$, they get back 100$.
The developments is crypto space is progressing fast and time is not far away we see interest growing.
Of course there is more to be done, but if solution is 80% ready, why wait for 100% to come. The point is to weigh in the benefits and adopt fast.
The digital era has started.

of all the BTC transactions till date, can anyone say which ones were initiated from Swung and Mist. NO. So that means Anonymous!
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:13:08
simple solution, move your BTC to other wallet. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:36:46
so how would you define growth. just trying to understand your perspective. Not an argument.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:02:30
so do you disagree that Bitcoin will not grow in 2019?
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:30:26
I first thought the same about the report but after some digging it made sense. Specially for the weakening dollar price considering the rising U.S. debt may contribute to some mid-term harm to dollar valuation. 
Also more and more institution grade custody options are opening up which may trigger money into crypto.

Your arguments look to be as noob. Not trying to put any criticism. we are here to learn but BTC is 100% anonymous. You cant tell user identity from it.
From transaction level details, yes you can see which wallet sent or received and how much.
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:05:09
very true. We may not see bull run any time soon but definitely towards end of 2019, tides will change.

Anonymous as user identity. It is in reference to central banking which is a red flag for them. Please check again and let me know.
May be how it is structured is leading to misinterpretation. So help me know. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:44:29
thanks for the feedback. So nothing to correct?
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:16:39
NOT an ape, may be the brightest species who sees the bright future. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:06:18
I think you have misinterpreted and to me nothing is wrong there unless others say likewise
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:29:05
Thanks a lot. Please share when you have time

Tangle could be a winner if any DAG based projects showcase a working protocol. 
HashGraph and Radix may gain lot of attention.

companies ignoring blockchain will soon be case studies in management schools like Nokia is today.
