How long till bitcoin has anything comparable to Monero in terms of privacy?  I love both projects, btw.
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:32:24
But not in all aspects. I know i'm getting downvotes here, but for me fungibility is a big issue in crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:35:38
Is it good for bitcoin? If you can't spend it...what use does it have? For example here in Canada there are barter transaction rules. If you buy something with it - you have to then work out capital gains etc. and declare that on your tax form. It's ridiculous but i see this as a huge hurdle.

Interesting. Yeah he seemed to think we are much closer than 10 years.
@_date: 2019-03-16 00:17:45
I feel that's still pretty high for most people.
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:39:52
Fair enough. I guess I'm looking at it through the lens of a currency.
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:47:58
Thanks, i'll give this a read.
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:13:49
Yep it's a threat to all. I want to know how this will affect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:04:18
Is it trivial though? He seemed to think that unravelling elliptic curve cryptography will be much easier for quantum computers. Wouldn’t a complete change in cryptographic algorithm be required?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:34:53
Why is Vitalik on there?
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:37:12
Barter taxation rules will still apply - as you swapped something with value for another good.
@_date: 2019-03-28 03:23:25
This is becoming a real issue though. The taxation rules surrounding Bitcoin are becoming a nightmare in the US and Canada.
They are trying to deter people from using it.

OP - might be a good idea to block out that member ID in the picture.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:25:56
Did anyone give you a meaningful answer?
@_date: 2019-02-05 16:09:39
Great post.
@_date: 2019-04-29 20:50:53
lmao. what is the original video btw?
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:53:17
She highlighted two words which are common in Peter Rizun’s tweets. How is that evidence?
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:31:32
Thanks for the clarification. This wasn’t clear from viewing the twitter thread.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:27:32
No problem. A seed is just a phrase (combination of random words) which can be used to recover a Bitcoin wallet. A wallet (such as Terzor, Ledger Nano) generates one of these when you first set it up.
Your seed can be used to restore the wallet if something bad were to happen to it (like your house fire example).
I'm by no means an expert, but I've done a fair amount of research on how to stay secure in this space. Andreas Antonopoulos has some brilliant videos on YouTube for this subject - i highly recommend watching them.

The recent issue with Binance is a perfect example of why you shouldn't store your coins on the exchange. None of them can be trusted.
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:55:13
Withdraw to your hardware wallet as soon as possible. In crypto anything can happen.
Not your keys...not your bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:13:19
You wouldn't take a screenshot of your bank balance and put it on here though would you? Tbh that's safer as your funds are protected. With Bitcoin there is no safety.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:48:10
Some sort of escrow service would be needed. Not an easy problem to solve...but someone will come up with a way
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:49:52
Yep...barter tax rules will cripple adoption here in Canada. IMO it’s the biggest threat to adoption. If the government makes it almost impossible to use bitcoin for purchases...then why would people use it over fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:31:18
Totally agree. Posts showing once’s balance or boasting about how much they have...should be deleted by the mods. Such moronic behaviour should be deterred.

Mostly down to society accepting that there is no god, that evolution (for us) has halted and that there are no rules to define how we should live. A minority number of the population are considered LGBTQ...yet the majority see them as a threat.

If satoshi claims his coins...Then yes - it is a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:26:34
Thanks for letting us know. I’ve added it to my spreadsheet of reddit user names and the amount they hold. Can’t wait to send you malware and use social engineering attacks.
Actually while you’re at it...can I have your address? If not, don’t worry - I’ll probably figure that out one day.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:25:16
This is an old meme...but recreated using the worst grammar and spelling.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:33:39
No i don't think so. The chances of an exchange a) being hacked b) doing a runner with your funds c) denying you access due to government / authority pressures are far higher than the issues posed by storing your private keys on a hardware wallet.
As long as you store (at least) two copies of your seed in safe, trusted and separate places - then i think the risks have mostly been mitigated. For the majority of people using cryptocurrency TODAY, this approach is probably the safest when it comes to 'being your own bank'.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:16:17
Gen x and boomers didn’t know about bitcoin though. Most are too outside of the tech loop to have really known about it.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:16:00
Dick move on your behalf. There is no law of code that defines a human - it’s exactly what makes us human.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:27:38
Nobody cares dude.

I heard that too - which doesn't surprise me. But on the whole i feel the industry has kind of nipped torrenting in the bud.
Same thing could happen with Bitcoin. Making it illegal to own / obtain will be difficult (and no doubt foolish). But they can prevent stores from accepting it - or make it as inconvenient as possible for stores to accept it. Just like the masses using Netflix instead of Torrents...the masses might use USD, as it's easier. Food for thought anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:01:49
People might get the book thrown at them further down the road (for not reporting these transactions). In Canada you have no choice but to HODL (for now anyway)
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:43:12
Not disagreeing with you...but they managed to make torrenting a "niche" way of downloading files. Torrenting is mostly used for downloading things illegally.
