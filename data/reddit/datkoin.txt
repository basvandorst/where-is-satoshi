Sorry guys I just sold some
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:09:04
Pay off your card kid.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:11:03
STFU and pay off your debts.

As a BTC owner (not borrower) I master the art of cutting my losses: 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:33:29
Pics/proof or it didn't happen Junior.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:37:34
What I am saying is that it is OK to sell Bitcoin at a loss and it is NOT OK to buy Bitcoin on leverage. This community needs to grow up.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:58:51
I am sure you have a debt somewhere. So no you're not gonna hold.
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:58:55
Debt-free thinker. And Bitcoin OWNER.
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:48:46
It is not vague at all. Record your transactions and pay your dayum taxes. This podcast is a good start: 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:30:42
Come on bois, I need you to throw more money at this thing.
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:24:35
Buy buy buy! You dumb fuks!
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:15:05
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:05:47
No. You are going to pay off your debts at some stage, fiat slave.
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:46:33
Doing great. Because I am in this unleveraged. Most bulls &amp; bears in this thread appear to use debt to buy. F-ing posers. Buying BTC on credit is the same as not buying.
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:30:03
You need to look at your overall financial picture. Do you have unpaid debts? If so, you are basically buying Bitcoin on credit. Which is the same as not buying Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:36:42
Good luck with you taxes.
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:24:09
I will buy when you have to sell. Buying on leverage is the same as not buying at all.
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:07:39
Quitaly, you mean.
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:10:56
Italy is falling. Let's GO from here.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:54:06
I sold some last night and it didn't go up.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:45:32
You're excused with the mortgage. And an exception around here. I paid mine off though.

Ramsey dislikes crypto tho
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:53:49
This post should be a sticky.
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:40:59
Repeat after me: the fate of the stock market is decided in the debt market. You, the financially illiterate, are funny.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:04:48
Repeat after me: crypto is NOT a hedge for the stock market.
@_date: 2018-10-28 03:08:30
If I trade my BTC for ETH it is a taxable event. Why not in case of trading BTC for a stablecoin?

Weekend dump is less intense than usual. Let's go!
@_date: 2018-06-04 08:54:20
It is super unhealthy not to check the price.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:50:11
It is because the crowd here is so young. A month truly feels like an eternity for them (and it should).
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:45:39
Wonderfully written.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:48:35
Nah. You see things that don't exist.
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:24:32
Get out of his brain dude.

I am getting the following error in the Ledger (Nano S) Live Android app when syncing a Bitcoin wallet: Java Exception in NativeModules.
Anyone know why this is? Other cryptos in my Ledger Live account sync without trouble.

Index investment gurus like jlcollinsnh are strongly advising against DCA. So keep this rubbish to your little crypto world.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:39:28
Do not take financial advise from people with a negative personal net worth.

Only reason for the rally were Jerome Powell's dovish remarks regarding interest rate hikes. And y'all biting.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:47:59
Do it
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:03:48
Indeed a typical crypto hodler, with an average personal net worth of minus 2 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:46:37
Dave doesn't do crypto.

@_date: 2018-03-14 19:32:23
NZ good choice
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:36:19
What is your net worth? Minus 2 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:21:15
Didn't this altcoin crash under a $1000,- ? Why still talk about it?
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:16:53
Nope. Only bank runs are good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:52:34
I really don't care.
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:32:59
Gold coins and something to protect yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:52:30

Its just a matter of time before MEW gets hacked.
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:53:21
A rari a day?
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:21:49
Yeah but it sucks when you see your sold coins go up mate
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:15:43
It's called a Rari.
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:15:51
I knew it too and I didnt sell
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:47:39
Will buy all the way down. Bring it!
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:34:43
I just bought the dip.

Stock market did well because of cheap credit. Crypto just like housing did well because of cheap credit.
The era of cheap credit is now over by the way. At the same time we will enter deflation. Google what that means for people in debt. You're welcome.
