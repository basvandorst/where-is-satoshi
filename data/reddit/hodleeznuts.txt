Other coins have high fees too. You just don't notice it because the value of the coins are substantially less. The only coin thatreally has low fees right now is BCH, but if BCH really took off, supercomputers would be needed to mine the gigablocks. So yes, "you need scale to have scaling issues" is the answer you were asking for. It just wasn't the answer you liked.

That's the thing though, with the wave of fake inventor millenials came a bunch of geeks excited about magic internet money, that are now disgruntled that they can't use it
Crypto in general is basically unusable as a currency. Nobody in their right mind would accept their salary in crypto as opposed to fiat

@_date: 2018-01-22 17:56:51
you did work for it tho, ya took a risk and based on intellect, luck or both, ya made off but if ya hadn't done anything you'd have made no money. plus if you already got your heart set on a new waverunner then yes you lost a waverunner

"if it stabilized"
exactly you would rather have fiat.
and you will continue to choose fiat until crypto loses volatility.

Yeah but imagine if you'd invested in Apple long before the bubble. Back when your Macintosh said "Ahhh!" when you start it up. Rode that bubble, and sold out at the peak or hodl to this day. You be a rich man

ok buy in at 10k again, oh wait its 15
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:39:10
i think gdax has an algorithm that sells crypto, at the current market price, a buy generally being higher and a sell being lower, but probably goes lower if can't find a buyer and higher if there are many, just a wild guess, based on the observation that they do at least have an algorithm that tries to give you a better deal when you set a stop order i think

just post them
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:13
they need one for the last 5 minutes. honestly you're not wrong but a good time to buy would have been at the 10k dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:07:24
agreed. let the free market deal with his bitch ass
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:08:36
they don't allow it with the other currencies, you have to sell your crypto to buy other crypto, you can't trade

you'll be saying that when there are no miners because all the coins have been mined. you might as well sell off and invest in bitcoin gold with that thinking 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:05
why short it when you can dump all your btc for ltc?

Normally, in USA, if employer does not do taxes for employees, they are still required to and employer ends up submitting payroll info when filing business taxes. So if you tried to evade income tax, they'd know automatically. It's better to just have the employer do it, or work under the table (off the books)
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:08:52
Well of course we are no doubt about that. 
Bitcoin is to the crypto bubbles what Apple was to the tech bubble: a good investment no matter what time you got in.

underrated comment 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:35:33
low is relative. a $30 fee to buy a car is still nothing compared to what you'd pay in sales tax. do you expect miners to mine for free? it says right there in the quote that you won't be able to buy coffee with bitcoin. that's what litecoin is for.

I'll answer that last question when you answer my question: do you expect miners to mine for free? i asked first

If it costs more than a few hundred fiats to set up a sufficient mining rig, then mining is centralized to the point that the network is fucked, pardon my french. What we need is a hash limit, it sounds like.

I use Robinhood to buy all my crypto stocks! It even has a USD on the front so you know how much real money you have! Aren't crypto stocks great?!
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:14:23
So mining for a pool has the benefits of more steady payout. I take it that mining solo can have a negative payout if you can't find a block or something (forgive me for I'm new to this sortof)? On the flipside (if there is one), would mining solo also have the benefit of being able to find a block and mine it for the entire reward? I guess what I'm asking is if mining solo is even feasible, or if mining pools have pushed that idea out of the market? I hate centralization, so, in my mind, things would be better if everyone mined solo and ran a full node.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:39:23
why even use a pool then when you can mine solo and trust yourself?

lol bitcoin is not a wealth redistributor. that sounds straight out of Karl Marx. nah it's a p2p electronic cash transfer protocol and nothing more. the point being decentralization of visa/paypal type shit. to be able to transfer cash across the globe in seconds without relying on a centralized protocol. making mining so expensive, that it becomes centralized into the hands of a few, is antithetical to bitcoin. I'm supposed to be asking you questions about mining, not quoting the white paper on you. this escalated quickly
