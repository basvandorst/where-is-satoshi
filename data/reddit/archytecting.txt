(1440 min per day / 9-10 min per block) * 12.5 BTC block reward =
1800 - 2000 new BTC everyday
supply isn't fixed but its reliable/predictable

a bit noob to ln network but from my understanding is that once lightning is widely accepted there would be no reason to close a channel.   it would be as infrequent as opening and closing a checking account.  you can still  add/withdraw funds from your channel

agreed.  anytime I feel the slightest bit of anxiety I just look at a log chart of btc...
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:09:53
step 1: transfer to a software wallet. (coinbase pro will cover the transaction fee to your wallet)
step 2: sign up for coinbase pro for future purchases. (you paid an upcharge using reg. coinbase)
step 3: watch as many of these videos as you can ;) 
you can switch to a hardware wallet if and when you have a larger amount.

question: if a ton of ppl were given access to BCH on coinbase/gdax recently... why hasn't the price of BTC shot up and the BCH price took a dive??
i understand there's been a lot of BCH pumping and hype in the media but that doesn't change the fact that BTC is inherently better and more valuable and i would have expected the above mentioned price shifts...
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:35
holy wow! btc on sale!! xmas special!  brought to you by Ver shenanigans &amp; and congested network FUD.  i bought in a bit more at 16.5k and don't care if it wasn't the bottom-est bottom of the dip

wait for someone to give you the second marshmallow...when they walk in, ditch the two marshmallows on the table and pry the entire bag of marshmallows from their hands as you run out the door??  does that apply here? prob not, or maybe thats wht shitty exchanges do to us?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:38
You know all those shows including this one where at any point you can just walk away with a decent lump of money or you can keep playing for an exorbitant amount of money...i am always the one yelling at the tv saying 'don't be a fool and loose it all! quit while you're ahead!'
now everyday its like i'm saying to my past self, 'stop bothering me, i'm playing a fun game called bitcoin...regis i'd like to go for just one more question'
in all serousness i'm worried about the btc futures coming up and that speculation is way ahead of btc utility at the moment.  still going to bet long tho...
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:58
yeah i mean i don't normally watch.  now mr robot is a different story. have to catch up on that....i digress
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:01:04
have ppl been experiencing slow tx out of GDAX? or other trouble withdrawing out to a wallet/ledger?  I just purchased some more BTC during this stupid civil war dip but want to move it off con-base asap...
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:10
i would like to know this too!  is there any evidence of volume specifically coming from the US in the last month or so that would indicate it's being pumped to short on cboe or cme?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:41:08
I tried to put in a limit sell order (for a small portion of my holdings) on GDAX when it was bouncing between 19K and 19.4K because there was a huge difference between GDAX and other exchanges and also that's a crazy price to hit today...
..but the orders didn't go through.  
GDAX kept giving me an error. or freezing. That kind of experience makes me worry about dealing with exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:31:15
yes, pegged to dollars. i.e. no employer would agree to a flat rate of 1 btc per month.  if anything OP would benefit if there was a dip whenever the employer purchases the btc to fulfill his paycheck

@_date: 2019-06-21 02:24:30
seriously anything over 10k is insane and might as well be the ATH cause 2017 10k-20k should not even be considered.  I have a feeling we'll bounce around 10k, but consider that we will never see  7k again. prob never! crazy. Makes me both sad and glad.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:09:36
what in the hell kinda of bounce is this!?
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:31:38
but now will it be long and boring to 10k or fast and fearsome?

here i'm thinking the jump from 7k to 11k happened quite fast, but this looks eerily similar.  soon the 20k bubble will look like a little blip of the past
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:56:24
So is BTC being pumped by all those who are dumping their futures B2X for BTC?  is a dip still coming?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:28:09
I'm worried what the impact of CME trading will do to price growth but still...

then you are putting all your trust in that platform.  if they are shady or corrupt or just ‘go out of business’ then there is no guarantee you’ll get your coins.
instead, if you have the private key to your own coins you are now your own bank.

TA for the coming weeks/months...quantum splitting is the only reasonable outcome:
logically the moment you try to sell btc converges into the swamp, but if you hold bitcoin converges to the moon.

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:15:14
I would think it might be bearish in the short term since the recent surge was in hopes of capitalizing on the double coins.  but always bullish long ;)
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:40:17
for those of you who went through the BCH fork:
1.  do you expect the B2X price to dive right away?
2.  will the price already have crashed significantly within the 24hrs it takes to get access to our B2X?
it does seem that coinbase is doing there best to give us access asap
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:28:03
just venting here...I technically bought in already with as much as I'm willing to risk but I'm still new to this roller coaster effect...if amazon announces the impossible today then i'm scooping up my life savings with a dumpster truck and driving over to an exchange...not really... 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:17:04
I have the same question as OP.  I just got a Ledger Nano and use coinbase/GDAX.  currently have my BTC on coinbase (lost out on BTG, don't care about that unsafe junk from what i've read) and was going to transfer to my Ledger Nano before, however:
assuming the price of B2X tanks immediately isn't it better to keep your BTC on GDAX and sell quick instead of waiting around with your BTC in a hardware wallet and then deal with the B2X later?
I understand the Ledger Nano is the safest option duirng the fork, but potentially not the most profitable...given the recent coinbase statement

...don't see electrum for iOS in app store.  only Win/android/Mac
what are people's experiences with Mycelium or GreenAddress for iOS?  both should be fine during fork I believe but lots of bad reviews/glitches
samourai's one click BTX transfer to BTC sounds great...wish it was ready for iOS

I for one certainly hope my measly investment makes great returns (or hodl and use appreciated value of BTC).  But, part of the reason I bought in though was knowing that if I had a dog in the race it would drive me to read and learn more about BTC and crypto.  I think a good number of people entering now want to be apart of the movement, even if they feel they are 'late to the game'

Went to a wedding on the west coast this summer, some guy was trading BTC on his phone.  After than the realizations started piling up:
oh, you don't have to just buy a whole bitcoin?
it's like gold only 'made' of electricity?
80% of bitcoin are already mined?  hurry!
China news and J Dimon gave me a price dip to buy into
andreas antonopoulos gave me reason to trust
reddit gave me reason to HODL
i've learned a lot since then.  i realize i'm late to the game but i'm also starting to think i'm not so late...
