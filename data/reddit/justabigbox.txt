We're down to mudslinging. We probably weren't going to get anywhere even if we could see eye-to-eye.

He's hopeless, guys.

Smells phishing to me.

And why, pray tell, is it a more elegant solution to try to redefine humanity's understanding of physics than to simply use pre-existing units that are clear in their meaning?

No problem.

Congratulations - you've tried to redefine the kilometer by calling it a meter.
Also *I do not think our biggest problem would be what the dickens to call our default unit of measurement*, but that's obviously beside the point.

Why? If everything is suddenly a thousand times bigger ~~and somehow still working as before~~, move up a notch. Meter-long animals are now kilometer-long ones; a ten-kilometer trips is now a ten-megameter trip; and hundred-millimeter unspeakables are now hundred-meter unspeakables. There's is patently no need to redefine anything, just keep measuring like you did before.
Oh, yeah, and every physics textbook ever written will have to be remade to account for "The New Meter™." It's really a hunk of gobbledygook we don't need.

**If you have neither your seed nor a backup of your wallet file, or have imported private keys, DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. Go to the Electrum board on  and ask there; they'll have a better idea how to recover, and I don't feel comfortable with any further recoveries.**
First, make sure you have your seed stored somewhere or have a backup of your wallet file.
Navigate to C:\Users\(user)\Roaming\Local\Electrum, *make a backup of the current wallet file in a new, secure location*, and delete all of the files present in the Electrum folder.
Reinstall Electrum and either A: choose to restore from seed, inputting your *original* seed into the box, or B: *if you have a wallet file backup* create a new wallet, returning to the directory and replacing the new wallet file with your backup after setup is done.
Try starting now.
Edit - Wrong account, whoops! Oh well.

Where did I redefine the meter? All I did was convert from old measurements to the new, equivalent measurements. A meter is still a meter, and functions identically to the previous "meter."
Also, I have thought about it, and that's why it would not work at all. Consider gravity, defined as (m1 * m2)/d^2, m1 and m2 being the mass of the two objects in question in kilograms, and d being in meters. If you throw in these new thousand-times-greater meters in, the gravity of earth is supposedly going to be the same as before - the fuck it is, it has a thousand-times-greater radius.
However, if you *don't* redefine the functional meter, you'd be plugging in values a thousand times greater, and would *actually get the correct numbers*.

It's simpler in some applications for people not directly working with anything remotely related to physics. I think those are far too few cases when we can in spirit append a "kilo" to our "meters" and call it a day. No math gets fucked up. Woo!
