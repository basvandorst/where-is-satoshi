Maybe it's me, but I need a simple wallet to store litecoin, etherum, bitcoin. Is the "free wallet" app legit? I'd like to store local but I like the convenience of mobile. Whats the best desktop app if local is best?

As a beginner myself, I would suggest coinbase via debit or credit card. I've found it to be the simplest way to buy bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin. First thing vets would recommend is to move your coins to your wallet after purchasing.

Any pictures of the back?

Much respect for makin that forecast despite we dippin right now. So, we'll see. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:18:40
Congrats. But you need to do a ton of research. I'd start by reading the stickies on the main post. Also, head over to r/bitcoinbeginners instead of r/bitcoin...only hodl'ers here (you'll learn what that means soon enough). I'm still learning myself and wouldn't give your questions justice as I'm on mobile.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:44:16
I think you're over thinkin'. Buy+hodl+ ???=profit.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:17:11
You're right, my bad.
