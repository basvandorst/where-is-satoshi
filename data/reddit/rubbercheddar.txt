I feel it.
I decided to take everyone's advice and leave my computer behind. Get to the airport and find that I'm making some money, but the alts I wanted to get into were mooned. So I come home and buy buy buy... then of course that translates for dips across the boards.

create a coinbase account, once that is done create a gdax account. You'll have to connect your bank account to coinbase and transfer money over to your 'coinbase usd wallet' there are no fees in this but it will take up to 7 days to process. You can also purchase from coinbase but you will pay a higher fee and still wait 7 days before you receive it (however it will be at the price you bought it at)
Once your coinbase has money in the wallet, you can choose when to buy (normally on a dip) or if you're longing just buy. You can also move money (crypto or fiat) between coinbase and gdax freely. I highly suggest these sites as the ease of use/transition is very good. 
Youtube is also a great resource. Look into "limit buy/sell" on gdax, much lower fee's overall than just placing and order through coinbase. Others will swear buy other markets however I suggest working up to being able to use them as they aren't for new people.
Good luck!

From what I understand, the more transactions the faster it is. 
edit: got that confused with IOTA tangle.

right, there is also no forced acceptance. They either have something worth while and people get invested or they allow it to die as another failed altcoin.

according to what I've read you want to move it to a wallet. You can move it back into the exchange and claim your new version of bitcoin as well. 
I'm hearing a lot of - the fork is unstable, many people can lose their bitcoins. Also - If you don't own your keys, you don't own the bitcoin type of deal.

Makes sense, people didn't get profit from the fork so they're selling back to fiat - esp being a time of year where people need money to spend on the holidays. 
What a ride BTC is. I love it

Nov 16th is the approximation, I've seen a couple dates but as of recent that seems to be the consensus
