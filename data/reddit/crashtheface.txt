Honestly mining with nvidia is 100% not worth it.
If you want to seriously get into mining forget about prebuilt fgpu's such as butterfly labs devices (good luck getting your hands on one.) either build your own fgpu or use some AMD hardware. 
You are pretty shit out of luck with nvidia,honestly it isn't worth mining with in your case.

What was up with that massive transfer from the other day I wonder

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:29:16
A common misconception.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:28:11
 this guy is hilarious haha 
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:52:07
well, basically you can "infect" many machines and have them mine for you.
you can create a service that runs as a background process [hard to pick up on if the user is computer illiterate] 
You can basically have this service mine to a specific worker account or server with a pretty small process footprint, Alone one computer can't mine much, but if you have this service running on a myriad of unsuspecting machines you can have a pretty solid botnet mining for you.
I highly recommend AGAINST using this method, as it is probably highly illegal and just morally wrong.  I have heard stories of people infecting everything from public computers at libraries, universities, business, and private schools to setting up illegitimate websites and downloads that will covertly install the service when clicking a link or installing downloaded software.

Miniature pinscher here, and yes man what a relief it would be if I could pay for pet food in bit lcoin, hell I may even afford to get another dog.

Finally someone who knows when thy fucked up.
Sorry to hear this happened man, everyone learns a lesson in itsec eventually. Just nice to see someone actually take responsibility for it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:19:04
could be a botnet that is my guess.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:44
Are you in a pool? On a team? What gpu? You should be able to pump out more than that in a few days. 
Hit me up I love helping fellow miners when I can!

I love how most of these fools think MT. Gox is the only exchange.
Looks like most of these "finacial gurus" are anything but.  Otherwise they would have steered far from this exchange for the time being.
Only thing i do agree upon is false advertising for 24/7 uptime.  That statement needs to be redacted from their frontpage asap.
Anyways, good for you cam you have some sense. Glad to see a few of us do.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:58:05
let me know what you find
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:51:47
Exactly.  Steer clear of this option guys, get a decent home or office setup or create a net with written permission.   Or join a pool
Doing shit like this will only hurt you in the long run.

excited to play! My current mining exhibition has been just to fund my trip to bitvegas!
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:07:22
Yeah boi! Totally would tip you if I wasn't on my phone right now. You are probably one of the only people I have noticed in this sub with some actual sense, that I have come across since this whole debacle.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:22:34
Still mining i guess it depends on how confortable you are.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:55:38
good point. Sorry I overlooked that danboy4

Solar Panels.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:56:58
This is why I use solar panels to power my rigs.
It's free money, and energy effecient. 
Bloomber doesn't have shit on me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:53:37
is this real life?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:41:05

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:57:26

@_date: 2013-04-12 14:46:56
This guy! I totally agree. These guys are getting way to much shit from these cry babies... No one forced anyone to trade here, if you lost money that is your own fucking fault.
