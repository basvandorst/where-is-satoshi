well thats good to hear, and i hope they also accept newer coins like  to be accepted as well. cause i am not going to buy coins that cost like 8k,9k and be insecure when i am doing transactions, i trust telecoin cause they use  Masternodes are incentivized nodes that receive rewards based on their availability and their ability to offer network services in a decentralized and trust-less manner.

@_date: 2019-08-14 21:21:55
i dont really believe in predictions unless they have a solid theory , thats why i am going for telecoin, cause i read about it and it does seem to have some uniuque features.

hahahaha, imagine you walking on a lonely street and a mugger comes and asks for your wallet and you say this, he will just stab you and rob you, so instead you can say that i already invested in BTC and TELEX , so he will know that he should rob you after a year and will let you go ... :-p
