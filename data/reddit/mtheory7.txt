Generally: Supply and demand like other answers
I guess it's more specifically determined by the individual prices on each exchange it is available at. The price for each exchange is determined by their order book (buys and sells that get executed)

The target and buy back values are recalculated every 25 seconds based on new market data/averages. They aren't set percentages from a certain price they are calculated averages for target selling price and for buy back price. Once the bot sells it immediately places a buy back to wait for. Should price continue to spike above 10% away from that buy back, it will cancel that buy back and continue it's normal bot routine. Tough to explain algorithms well over text media haha essentially, yes. The bot is 100% self sustaining and self configuring

Yeah! The price spiked so it sold. It's now waiting for the price to drop before buying back. The goal is to increase the amount of BTC that I have not the amount of USD

That's exactly it!

Thank you!!
Mine is hosted using a 1GB 1CPU - AWS EC2 instance in the free tier! Its an Ubuntu instance and it simply pulls the code, compiles and runs it. Its a great option that eliminates the worry about powering and setting up the hardware. EC2 provides excellent availability so the bot rarely goes down. Check it out if you feel like it :)

Agreed! Cash App is surprisingly good for buying btc their fee is pretty reasonable tbh

It also shows that their fees must be lower to convert BTC to USD than the CC fee to the merchant ��
