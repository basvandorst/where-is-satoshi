I am not aware of any technical issue which would cause Mark Karpeles to wonder whether the coins were stolen or not, unless the mining pools were sending coins to Gox first and then later to another exchange after 100 confirmations.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:21:15
When mining becomes predominantly cloud-based on specialized hardware it will be appropriately centralized for control (similar to the shit show going on with exchanges). Any government that wanted to could step in and pwn a data center likely without the owners even knowing about it. Happens all the time.

If it can be conclusively demonstrated that the coins were lost and not stolen, this is a strong possibility. Anyone who has BTC and a brain understands what taking a million early adopters and giving them the shaft will do to confidence. It's far better to restore the 6% than to bounce them out of the pool because a turd floated by.

An interesting thought: Coinbase and MtGox were working together at one point. Coinbase seems to have some sort of timelock solution in place for governing purchases of coins from a hot wallet. It makes sense that they would have shared notes along the way regarding how this could be constructed.

They are attempting to distribute this coin to goxholders and then continue mining the coin so that any proceeds that are generated to the goxholders are partially distributed to those who chose to continue mining it. It's even worse than the original Humint proposal.

The original key is destroyed as part of the creation of the timelock (it's destruction is required). This remains an off-blockchain transaction that is later available for spending once the timelock is lifted. That's how the timelock works. The new key will only be valid once the time has expired, the transaction has been broadcast to the blockchain, and the transaction has been adequately mined. Then the lock has officially been lifted and the coins can be spent.

BitCoin is getting "constitutional ammendments" with each release. You can't have a broadly adopted functioning store of value with this irreversable potential. The world will learn to fear Crypto if Goxers are hung out to dry.

Here are a few ideas: 
Force exchanges to report public and continuous verification of funds and balances, both in fiat and in BTC which reconcilt to the blockchain. Permanently confirmed solvency. 
Security certifications required to operate an exchange and pass cold storage and hot storage tests.
Security protocols to protect PII of account holders.

Dovetailing (I agree with ex_ample)...Why would the NSA release a cryptographic hash they could not themselves break? Given everything we know about the NSA, which is more likely: 1) the NSA out of benevolence to the world releases an unbreakable hashing algorithm 2) the NSA in an effort to control communications and ensure they have access to the most sensitive data pushes widespread adoption of a cryptographic hash they have the answer for already. 
Take a minute to think about what's most consistent with the NSA.

If someone stole those coins they should immediately submit them back to a Gox wallet as the transactions will be tracked forever through the blockchain and could never be spent. It's like having permanently black money. Those coins would be cursed forever.

Consider this: why is Crypto gaining traction in Cyprus? Because the EU forced Cyprus bank account holders to eat their losses and take equity in the banks with the long term maybe that they would get their money back.

Sounds like the "form of RAID" they were using had a problem (could be portions of the key were stored in different places and one or more of those places was corrupted or is currently inaccessible) and they are praying that they can recover the key. 
A rogue employee pulled them.
OR 
A customer they know the identity of has them.
I'm betting transaction malleability did play a role, but that when they went to unlock the cold storage they realized they had a much bigger problem. This would explain their announcement on the 20th indicating certain additional technical and security issues. Mark's comment indicates he believes they can get them back. I think the first scenario sounds most plausible given Mark's apparent lack of absolute self-destructive depression. 
It's unlikely that Mark, given his penchant for quietness, would have shared the complete story. He probably said this to the crisis consultant. Scenario: Assume the following is true (this would be his worst case scenario).
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:39:35

Go to Satoshi: 
"[nTimeLock] is an open transaction that can be replaced with new versions until the deadline.  It can't be recorded until it locks.  The highest version when the deadline hits gets recorded.  It could be used, for example, to write an escrow transaction that will automatically permanently lock and go through unless it is revoked before the deadline. "

You want to know why the dollar must remain stable? Because the world's debt is denominated in dollars (FAR more money than is in circulation) and the holders of that debt do not want to see their holdings become worthless in relative terms.

Alright, you got me out of bed with this post. I knew this ID looked familiar and then remembered all your posting on the key GitHub pull request with gmaxwell and others commenting on the blockchain.info ntxid fix. 
This does sort of line up with the idea that withdrawals would be limited / throttled for a while.  Can you go deeper? Inquiring minds... I read up on time_lock. If you were designing the solution how would you do it? Could Mark have fucked up the code fix himself by attempting some elaborate automated throttle on withdrawals using a series of time_lock transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:59:55

fascinating. under this scenario: could this be fixed if Gox provided their cold storage in escrow to the BitCoin foundation and allowed them to address the fix by temporarily modifying the time parameters or mining parameters of the protocol (would cause broad network disruption similar to the improper fork that occurred during last year's upgrade attempt but could allow for recovery)

Bitcoin is the trial. The real coin comes later. Do you really think the global elite want to see Andreas, Adam, and company in Davos every year? There will be an electronic currency party but bitcoiners will not be invited. 
Any thinking libertarian has every reason to fear crypto because in the end the only transactions permitted by law will be with known addresses tagged to a registered entity. Dealing in anything else will be considered illegal, and you'll kiss your privacy goodbye forever. We can claim no one can stop the technology and that's probably true for the most part, but governments can stop the adoption of bitcoin and that's as good as killing it for most people. 
It's very important that we think several moves ahead. Don't be a sheep following the herd to the slaughterhouse.

Yep I can appreciate the pure logic of the argument not to assist; however we have 550,000 verified accounts from early adopters that are stuck. Aside from the technical work there's an important social adoption consideration as well that likely outweighs the technical work in the short run. If MtGox agreed to hand over the reigns or shut down, I'd hope that folks like gmaxwell would change their views. Thanks for syncing up on here Inovy, have to head to sleep, but the conversation was extremely helpful in understanding this potential root cause, remediation actions, and possibly why MtGox suddenly stopped publicly communicating.
