Understood. 
My hypothetical goal was to send the BTC across the globe without actually shipping anything. Opendime is a piece of hardware, you would have to ship it. 
And if you send the private key by breaking it in a few pieces and sending them separately it would probably be also quite secure

A Ponzi scheme promises exceptional returns based on an ever-growing # of investors. New money comes in to pay off earlier investors. When the rate of increase is not sufficient to pay off the next tier of investors, the scheme collapses. 
Bitcoin is a limited asset and does not rely on a growing # of investors. 
The commodity it is based on is the ability of instantaneous, global, decentralized peer to peer transactions (just as it was originally envisioned). 
Basically just like a credit card company, but without the fees and without any bank control. 
Are Visa and MasterCard and American Express etc also Ponzi schemes?

Warren Buffet has always been championing what he calls “value investing”. He buys stock in Companies that have solid balance sheets and for some reason a stock price that he feels is lower of what should be the appropriate price. Very old school investing, and very successful in the long term. He doesn’t even use derivatives and other “modern” financial instruments. 
If you follow his line of reasoning, it’s easy to see where his comments come from. He simply does not have a frame of reference to put a value on cryptos. 
The bitcoin revolution is probably too abstract for someone who has worked in the “regular” stock market for decades. His thought processes cannot be applied to the cryptoworld. 
Although, a more correct behavior would be simply to say that he doesn’t fully understand the dynamics of this new thing and as such decline to comment on it.

@_date: 2018-06-02 11:33:20
I believe it’s actually the opposite (I wrote an earlier short post about it). It’s manipulation during the week, where negative forces (banks? Other financial institutions?) push the price down. Then, as soon as the official markets close, the price starts climbing up during the weekend because the regular, unaltered market forces of supply and demand take over. And BTC at $7.5k it’s a steal.

A lot of people who lost the train (including banks, financial “gurus”, fund managers and a whole bunch of idiots who call themselves experts), are doing everything they can to push the price down to get to a sweet buy point. 
They do this because the real analyses they have done (not the ones they are spreading after filling them withFUD), showed them the tremendous potential. 
And they’re pissed they didn’t have the balls to buy two years ago.

Yes there are some smart people who have managed to be debt free.  But I guarantee you that if you ask 100 random people around you, probably &gt;95% carry some debt, whether a mortgage, car payments, credit cards etc. 
and technically, if you live in the US, the 20 trillion $ debt divided by approx 300 mln ppl means each person carries a debt of ~65k.

I agree with you, to a point, but I would expect a more balanced view, like they do with other more established assets/stocks. Please allow me to give you an example. 
General Electric is IMHO an awesome Company. It does everything, from jet engines to MRI machines. 
And it does it well. 
One year ago its stock was at more than $30. Today it’s  at less than 14 (I have no idea why). So it lost more than 50%. And this is a loss that counts, because GE stick is part of many general funds and pension funds as well. But have you heard anyone calling GE a bubble? Of course not, and I’m not saying it is -at all! But just because your perceived value fluctuates a lot doesn’t mean there isn’t long term potential. Which is exactly what all the articles I was mentioning are trying to tell us, that btc has zero long term value. 
This is what I call manipulative bias. Just my 2c. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:21:44
If I were a smart guy probably I wouldn’t need to wonder, but since EVERYONE in this world, people, cities, States, Countries etc carry a shitload of debt, the question is.... drumroll..... where the F has all the money gone?!?!?
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:17:45
Basically you have to find an exchange (that has a smartphone app) that supports sweeping a paper wallet. You do that by choosing the “sweep wallet” option and then point the camera at the paper wallet’s private key code. 
The paper wallet balance is therefore transferred to the exchange. This is an actual transaction, so you will pay a fee. 
Now, I’m not familiar with coin square and I don’t know if it supports sweeping paper wallets. 
I think the blockchain.info app lets you do that. 
Hope this helps.

I don’t get where all these ill-advised “ crypto-enthusiasts” come from.

Because it’s the law, my friends.

@_date: 2018-03-23 03:08:26
Let’s assume you do the same with stocks, and buy/sell 100 shares each time (instead than 1 btc). 
In the US the default for stocks is FIFO, although you can choose in writing which lot you sell, and you can even mix and match. 
But I don’t know if for btc there are special rules, and I would like to see others’ comments here. 
Curiously, in your example, you would probably be better off paying short term tax on the btc you bought for 3k and sold for 4K (gain 1k minus expenses, assuming 40% income bracket you will pay 400$) than long term on the first btc (gain 3k, at 20% long term you will pay $600).
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:08:14
Hopefully you didn’t buy on borrowed money. 
If you do, you are almost certain to end up with a loss. 
Because of the (still) highly speculative traits of btc investments, the best bet is to buy a little at a time, using play money only (money you would spend on a restaurant, or on unnecessary things). 
When you do that, you don’t have that anxiety that will inevitably bring you to sell when prices plunge. 
Hang in there my friend. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:53:28
If your entire income for the year is below a certain amount, you may not have to file taxes at all. Otherwise, technically speaking, ANY income should be reported. 
In terms of actual enforcement by the IRS, I don’t know what’s their threshold for going after someone. It also depends how traceable your transaction is. 
If someone else reports the transaction because they can use it to offset their own profits, or if the transaction is with a registered US-based exchange, the IRS will already have a means to track it down. 
Now, remember that if they find a reason to audit you, they can go back several years and look at everything in your tax forms. Obviously, if you’re  as clean as a whistle, you’ve got nothing to worry about.

@_date: 2018-02-27 14:13:32
Assuming you’re based in US, no tax until you sell or trade. 
BUT: keep track of you purchase date and cost basis, and all associated costs. Written documentation is best. 
Also, if you keep for more than 1 year and sell for a profit (after you deduct all applicable costs/fees), you will only pay capital gain tax (currently 15-20% federal). 
For short-term trading, more complex rules apply.

I’ve done some research, this is what I have come up with (YMMV):
1. An Antminer S9 uses about 1.5 KWH.  To make sure you have some built-in reserve, plan to be able to deliver 1.8-2 KWH to the PSU. 
2: A solar system delivers on average 75-80% of the rated power, not counting losses for output conversion.  All-in you want to plan for a nominal 3KW system to power one Antminer. 
3. This will work only in full sun and obviously only during daytime hours.  In order to avoid a shutdown every time a thick cloud comes by, you should use a battery buffer (a few lead-acid batteries, best ones are forklift batteries). 
From here the road split, whether you want to use directly 12 volts from the panels and the batteries or use the solar panel output to power an inverter that powers the antminer’s dedicated PSU. 
4A. If you choose the first option, to avoid frying the Antminer, power supply must not exceed 13.0 volts, so you will need a voltage drop between battery (during charge may reach 14 volts) and Antminer.  Also, to prevent destroying the battery, you will need an automatic disconnect when battery voltage drops below 11.5 volts. 
4B. If you choose the second option (from solar to inverter to psu) you will hav less chance to fry the Antminer but will still need to protect the battery from overdischarge.   
What I have described above is for a solar-only system. 
You will be able to mine only during sunny days. 
If you want to mine 24/7, and you want to completely offset the electricity bill with solar generated power, your best bet is to install a grid-tied system. 
Hopefully you live in a deregulated market and your utility will provide net metering. 
In this case you will need more than 10KW nominal system to offset one S9 power consumption and generate enough excess power during the day to offset power consumption during the night. This of course, assuming you have 365 sunny days per year where you live. I know it seems a lot but this is the number that the solar power generation charts tell you that you need to offset 1000KWH per month (which is roughly one S9’s monthly power consumption). 
The cost of an installed and grid tied 10kwh system is north of $20K. In my case it didn’t make sense. 
Don’t mean to discourage you but plan well before you start. Good luck.

I don’t think that buying bitcoin from an ATM is illegal under any circumstance (but I’m not 100% sure, so dont bet the house on it).

I don’t get the point because what you write doesn’t make sense.

I’m not after anything in particular. 
I own a handful of bitcoins and if it goes up I’m happy. 
But when CBOE futures started on Dec11 the initial puts were for btc at 8k by mid February. Guess what happened next. 
My point is to warn young, enthusiastic, possibly inexperienced investors (I assume, maybe wrongly, that many btc lovers are not exactly Wall Street wolves) of the risks of jumping into this if they don’t have plenty of play money and patience. 
And when normies buy the dip, money comes in that’s easy to skim by automated platforms.

Would you be willing to divulge in what Country this happened (but only if it’s safe for you to do so and noone gets in trouble)?
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:37:44
He’s totally messing with you!
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:59:15
Lol. With $63 you could have bought 100,000 BTC. 
And today you would have $ 750 MILLION. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:56:57
That’s actually a good question. I’m baffled too. 
Some may say that a rising tide lifts all boats in the bay, but I’m a little worried about this phenomenon. 
There are so many altcoins, and some are so specialized in their purpose that I do not understand why almost always they all rise and fall together.

I’ve been wondering too. 
Anyone has an idea?
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:21:06
It depends on your personal situation. Sell what? How much? How much did you pay for it? What are your goals? Etc.

I respect your opinion, but shorting a stock doesn’t help anyone. 
When you buy a stock is (should be!) because you believe that Company is doing a good job, putting out a good product etc. You become a part owner and your money helps them continue what they are doing, expand their workforce etc. 
When you short a stock, you basically hope that Company does badly. You don’t help them improve, or help them pay their retirees’ pensions. 
Before the financial deregulation, all these derivatives didn’t exist. You could buy a stock or sell it. 
Then Wall Street invented shorting and computer-powered automated algorithms that make trades 20,000 times a second. The stock market has become a mess, and a way for greedy executives  to make money out of other peoples’ misfortunes. 
Many of these derivatives are not available to regular Joes, only to institutional investors. THAT is what’s unfair, because it ruins the game for everyone. 
I still wish you good luck, though!
Cheers.

What are 5 and 6? Just curious...

Lending will allow shorting, and shorting will allow huuuuge price manipulations....

Hey, can you post a tutorial, a link or some info on how to do that?
Every time I go to a restaurant I always ask them if they accept bitcoin (even if I already know they don’t). 
I do that to help with adoption. Occasionally the managers seem interested in knowing more, I would like to have a printed sheet with some explanation/info to give them. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:06:10
That it has no value. That kind of FUD is often broadcast by “financial orthodoxy experts”.

I did not. I ordered two S9’s directly from Bitmain in China and I’ve been very happy with their service. 
It does take a little work (wire funds and upload confirmation pictures of the payment) and patience, but it’s very professional and I also got valuable coupons for future orders. 
I will order from them directly again. 
Just my experience. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:48:34
Thank you!

Assuming the worst has happened, look at it this way:
You paid $120 to learn a valuable lesson, one that will possibly prevent you from losing thousands in the future by not repeating the same mistake.
I also have 0.1 btc stuck in an old android phone and can’t find the private key the program wants to let me send it somewhere else.

Or Cyprus. A few years back the government there suddenly decided to seize 20% of every savings account to reduce national debt. Boom, done. 
20%of your life savings were gone.

For those (like me) who think btc is headed to the moon, the IMF acknowledgement equals to fueling up the rocket!!

Get an account on any exchange, like Coinbase, bitstamp, bitfinex etc. 
Then put it for sale at the current (limit) price. 
That’s how you do it. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:48:31
Very true for the long-term, but IMHO not for the intraday or 2-3 day swings.
