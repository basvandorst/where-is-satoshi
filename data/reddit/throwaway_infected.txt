This particular virus exits if it detects virtual box, to evade analysis. I linked the source code provided in the thread

No i would not have run it as root, and bitcoin users probably dont have their wallet file owned by root either. Rather by the user that needs access to it (ie read permissions).
edit: from that point, if the hacker is not satisfied with the many btc a user might have in that wallet, he still has access to all user accessible files.

This is a multiplatform RAT, if you look at the code it will infect Windows, Linux or Mac, it's Java.
My windows firewall helped me here, i'm afraid on linux it might not have.

Maybe their version is not vulnerable

I think the point he was making is that Antivirus dont always check .jar (like in this case) and the .jar could include bytecode, or as is the case here, just provide remote access to upload and execute anything. Likea keylogger + send the btc wallet off, and wait for user action.
Or even just suck out BTC from an unprotected wallet.

An old mailing list database was compromised, not cavirtex directly, but affects CA virtex clients.

thanks checking out sandboxie
edit: if you look at the code this  RAT actually checks if virtualbox is installed and running, and exits if it is. so it tries to evade analysis that way.

My bitcoins are safe.
This RAT infects bitcoin users (look at the source code, references to BTC, and imports libraries that siphon Bitcoin from the wallet.)
