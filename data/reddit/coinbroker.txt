Bitcoin is not a stock, it's a currency. Even Google and Apple as high as they are will always be limited because stocks will never replace dollars.  When we're talking stocks we're talking about market caps in the billions. When it comes to currencies we're talking about *trillions*. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:34:36


No I don't. And bitcoin isn't a stock, it's a currency. Because of the sheer volume of money they control they can never put in enough money to ever make a worthwhile return on it. All it would do it undermine their position and make incumbent holders rich. *That's* why they hate it. They can't win this game and they can't cheat on it like they're used to.

@_date: 2014-03-03 12:30:56
Sure you can. What you're actually saying is that you can't *buy* bitcoin without the legacy banking system. In reality even this isn't true, you merely need to find a trading partner that accepts your barter. Fiat is merely the most common barter tool but I'm sure it wouldn't be impossible to find someone that wants to trade something else like precious metals or even gift cards for BTC.  And KYC laws very much *do* apply to Coinbase but there is significant leeway in how they are enforced and interpreted. In the case of Coinbase buys are limited by how much information you're willing to supply. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:39:15

They could try but they would fail miserably. The whole point of bitcoin is that it can't be controlled and *that's* why they hate it so much. Sure they could dump a billion dollars into a 51% attack but the markets would quickly switch over to a new crypto. Wash, rinse, repeat. Not that 51% attack is even the end of the world. They'd better start quickly because by the time they get around to it they're going to need a lot more fiat than a measly billion. Oh and there's going to need so many wafers that Intel, Apple, and a host of other players is going to be rather pissed about the price of processors, phones, and tablets sky rocketing in price for the first time in history due to their little "project" which they won't be able to keep secret for this very reason.

That's the really cool part of the protocol. I liken bitcoin to TCP/IP.... it's been around since the internet was invented (over 40 years ago now?) but it's never been replaced, only expanded upon. Both are truly amazing. 
They're like a set of ingredients in the kitchen like eggs, sugar, flour, butter, etc. that the chef (the developer) can use to make any variety of implementations. Pastries, cakes, pies, croissants, cookies, the possibilities are nearly endless but the core ingredients are the same. 
So as it stands the "kitchen" is now fully stocked and ready for developers to come in and create any variety of implementations. We're just at the very beginning right now and it's going to get amazing interesting, versatile, seamless, and easy to use. 
We've only scratched the surface. Biometric authentication will make bitcoin even easier to use than it is today. Your face, voice, finger print, palm print, location, or any other identifier will be able to be used to secure your transactions all without privacy concerns because these can all be controlled by the *user* rather than a third party. We're *finally* going to have true economic freedom which itself is *real* freedom!

Bitcoin is very much libertarian but more importantly it actually makes libertarianism make *sense* once you analyze it. It doesn't work at all with centralized currency because of usury and it's association with regulatory capture. 
But even if you don't agree with with libertarian ideology you should agree that monetary freedom is comparable with all the *popular* political ideologies excluding of course fascism, corporatism, oligarchy, and most of the other repugnant forms. 
The capitalist should appreciate that free money allows for true meritocracy in the market place. The socialist should appreciate the fact that bitcoin eliminates usury and reduces (and even *corrects*) wealth disparity. Monetary freedom goes a long way to making most political ideologies *better* and more compatible with each other. 
We don't and probably never will live in a solitary political system but rather a hybrid and this will probably continue to be the case for most of our lifetimes. Even the monetary system will continue to be a hybrid even if hard currencies make *significant* inroads. It's my belief that hard currency in practice ultimately makes these systems less distinguishable from each other.

He derides bitcoin because it doesn't take into account inflation while ignoring the fact that inflation is a concept that only applies to fiat currencies.... because governments keep inflating them! 
Because bitcoin obsoletes the concept of usury you no longer have to worry about equatable distribution of resources (and wages, rents, etc.) That is because these are all symptoms of wealth disparity which is again *created* by usury. 
The folly of the popular bitcoin critique is trying to examine it through a fiat paradigm which inevitably starts from false dichotomy.  
@_date: 2014-03-29 11:11:13

Irrationality. Seriously. And no, Gox doesn't have anything to do with it *beyond* the fact that it freaks out markets. Just because Gox is having problems (of their own making) it should have no effect on the rest of the ecosystem. In fact many have argued the price should *up* as the Gox price falls due to market equilibrium. 
Any argument to the contrary presuppose that bitcoin isn't a hard currency. If for example a fiat bank fails it can have spillover effects because the currency isn't hard. That simply doesn't apply for bitcoin. 
Also the stock markets are up today which is probably the biggest reason. This is also irrational.

I think it could if phased in. Right now we have the worst of all worlds tax system. A flat tax isn't quite right under a fiat regime because there's too much wealth disparity. That is to say that a millionaire and a poor person still pay the same amount of money for a sandwich. (See:  ) 
That being said bitcoin should eventually smooth wealth disparity making a flat system more fair since fairness is already built into hard currencies due to the absence of usury. 
Until then a progressive system is still better, if anything it need to be far *more* progressive. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:11:24


When you think about it everything in the world since even the beginning of time requires trust in something. We live more or less dependent that 80 or 90% or so of what we deal with day by day will be consistent. Cryptography technologies do not require the user to trust simply anything but merely to indicate to others what they already *do* trust. In any given transaction the trust needs to be mutual to work or the transaction cannot complete. 
If you buy alcohol for example both you and the merchant trust the identification issued by the state. The transaction fails if one of you does not trust the third party.  The current problem is that these instruments are not perfect (you could use a fake ID for example). Crypto will make these instruments far more perfect.

Most of this stuff isn't so trivial that it can be done over the internet (for example). The problem seems to be that it's too easy for rogue actors on the "inside" to do it. We're talking about service employees who make very little money or even those who apply for these positions specifically to gain access to them. 
If you think the "public facing" systems are insecure the *internal* systems are even *less* secure. It's not exactly hard to gain physical access to the hard drive on a POS system for example which usually contains a treasure trove of unencrypted data. And who's standing guard? Middle management employees who have no concept of data security beyond needing to enter their password for access. Unfortuantly these passwords are rendered useless by anyone who has even a basic level of IT knowledge.

It necessarily gets better because you cannot collect usury on bitcoins. That means that ones overall *percentage* of wealth even at the high end is always going *down*, not up as with fiat. The wealth distribution problem naturally corrects itself with time. Gone are the days were wealth is passed down generations for centuries at a time, once you spend a coin you can't get it back. 
This effect isn't seen right now because market equilibrium has not yet been reached but a time will come (and it could come quickly) when bitcoins value are simply static or only *slightly* deflationary due to mining. (BTC deflation during the mining period is still 50X *less* than that of the dollar and *dropping*). 
When that time comes the gravy train is over which means people then become savers because without the interest of fiat money every dollar you spend you'll never get back without a truly equal amount of economic contribution. 
But that's the beauty of bitcoin. It takes advantage of human greed to help part the greedy from their money for the benefit of society. It also should have possitive enviromental effects due to decreased consumption. If people know that the car they buy today might someday buy a house they might think long and hard about if they actually *need* it. But most won't and that's OK because their wealth truly *will* trickle down. 
tl:dr: Wealth disparity is not a problem with bitcoin.

What does that make the people worth several times more fiat than the entire bitcoin market cap? I think we need a new definition of "privileged" because it clearly doesn't mean what you think it means anymore. 
More importantly is the fact that the "bitcoin rich" will not stay rich in perpetuity because bitcoin eliminates usury. Gone are the days of wealth staying in families for generations. Most who make money with bitcoin will spend it just as fast as they made it and that's a *good* thing because bitcoin quickly redistributes wealth. It's not about the amount one owns but the *percentage*, a percentage that can only go *down* not up as bitcoin is spent and new coins are mined. Bitcoin thus insures that wealth disparity naturally goes *down*, not up. 
Bitcoin is monetary freedom which itself is *true* freedom. It allows the oppressed to free themselves without allowing them to make themselves the new oppressors.

What you are suggesting is that a particular group is trying to unload their coins on another at a higher than market profit which is absurd. Bitcoins have value *because* they are scarce. If they were abundant they would cease to have market value. Furthermore there is no single source of bitcoins which is required for a Ponzi.

There's only 2 economies here because fiat and cash are the same. 
None the less the fundamentals aren't changed. As more value floods into bitcoin it will inflate fiat currencies until they are rendered useless. More importantly this can happen slowly or quickly as it's a 100% market driven phenomenon. The end result will be many formally rich bag holders.

It's purely a theoretical question. If their security is good and they have an exit strategy this isn't necessarily the case. Such could include throwing up a contingency server and informing users via e-mail how to retrieve their assets. So why not make this plan known to users now? Because they don't intend on failing and such a strategy implies that their *current* strategy is ill conceived.

This seems hyperbolic. Sure you can fault them for breaking government laws and regulations but what does this have to do with customers? What I want to know is what the risk is for users who take responsibility for there use of the system? It's your own fault if your not using 2FA and protecting your e-mail password. 
With all do respect bitcoin is not a nanny state technology, it's decentralized for a reason. That necessarily requires that the users take certain risk when they choose to rely upon a third party. In the case of BTC-E I've not seen any evidence that they've proven themselves to be unsecure in their technology or dealings with users (not governments, there's a *difference*). 
Until then your complaints seem to be merely theoretical in nature and could apply to any third (second?) party exchange or bitcoin service on the internet. In any case it's the *users* responsibility to conduct their own risk assessment and decide if they are willing to use such service. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:43:24
Not really, the difference is that if they fail they will not be bailed out by the government.

That's because fiat is the incumbent currency.

Once they can they will not longer to have pay to convert it back to dollars thus saving even more money.

The consensus seems to be that it "can't" drop past 520.... and if it does it could be bad. It should however be mentioned that even some of seasoned "experts" on that sub have been dumbfounded by the current activity. Personally I feel the biggest problem is attempting to apply stock models to bitcoin, it's a *currency*, not a stock.  
The current price however does not indicate crash territory. Furthermore it looks like a "fix" is in but it may be somewhat of a moving target because it takes time to deploy and test. Most of this is just simple irrationality. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:25:43
Inkjet. And yes emulsion based papers (typically laser printed in the photo shop such as Fuji Frontier, etc. ) are the gold standard but they shouldn't be used for obvious reasons. 
Even "standard" photo paper does a good job locking in water based ink and standing up to UV. This is based on personal experience. I've got inkjet prints on cheap copy paper that fade mere months after printing but also 3x5's that are still looking fresh after 2 or 3 years tacked on the wall. I've also tested the colorfastness by actually wetting these prints with *very* good results. 
Laser printed wallets are of course better but few people have color laser printers despite the drastic price declines in recent years. Nor do most have black only printers. The reasons for 3x5 inkjet printed wallets are numerous. First of all few people buy high quality letter or A4 inkjet paper. Even if they do it's not as good as photo paper at holding inkjet ink. Inkjet printers are still by far the most popular printers and 3x5 inkjet photo paper is cheap, widely available and compatible with even the oldest inkjet printers that use water based ink formulations or even newer printers with generic ink or cartridges that use questionable ink. 
In short I feel this is good, widely available solution for paper wallets that will provide adequately durable results for most people. No, it's not the *best* or most perfect solution but should work well for most people while providing a low barrier to entry.

The technology behind bitcoin isn't particularly interesting just as the wheel for example isn't particularly interesting. What *is* is what it has managed to accomplish. It's essentially a Trifecta of technology, monetary theory, and decentralization. This is really the most brilliant article on the subject:
I find that most people in the bitcoin community don't fully understand why the phenomenon is important, they are more attracted to the technology for technologies sake. 
Once you strip that away you find that it's a very libertarian movement and yet few would necessarily describe their involvement as politically motivated. Taken to it's logical conclusion bitcoin has the potential to destroy neoliberal economics because it abolishes the concept of usury. Now one might suggest that gold or some other hard money could also do this but without a public ledger these can also be manipulated. Because usury and it's associated wealth in perpetuity bitcoin has the power to eliminate the vast wealth disparity that modern banking has (arguably) enabled. 
While bitcoin will indeed create fortunes they will not be long lived because the wealth "created" by bitcoin is merely the arbitrage of currency markets that have not yet met equilibrium. Once they do a bitcoin will be a stable store of value, once spent it will require an equal amount of truly measurable labor and/or resources to replace. That is to say that your money will no longer work for you. One will be expected to work for their money. This should have a lot of interesting social benefits. The poor will no longer be as poor and the rich will no longer be as rich. That's not to say that they won't exist because indeed some people *do* in fact work harder than others but it should eliminate exponential differences. 
This should tighten credit or even eliminate the concept. We thus become a society of savers which has positive social and enviromental benefits. Not being able borrow from the future means less consumerism and less waste because we will no longer be able to enviromentaly fund a lifestyle we can't afford. As a result the vast amount of resources we already have which had been deemed as "uneconomical" all the sudden become very economical.... but I digress.

The Fed has all but guaranteed a giant crash. The only thing that might stall it for a while (and has thus far) is reinstating or increasing QE. It's also important to note that QE has not stopped, the amount has merely been slightly reduced. The Fed is still pumping $75 billion a *month* into the economy (or over 7x the bitcoin market cap). To date they've already injected trillions. This has also *never* been done before in this history of central banking, it is not at all normal.

The way I see it hard currencies (like bitcoin) are the missing link to libertarianism. Without that it becomes a tool of conservatives and a joke to leftists. How can you have small government when the currency can be manipulated at will? The way I see it *usury* is the problem, not "big government". Usury is a tool of corporatism (by which I mean oligarchy, regulatory capture, fascism, and other *isms*) which then can use the power for further government control. Usury creates vast wealth disparity which then necessitates a welfare state. "Small government" simply isn't possible until we put the the money back into the hands of the people. Many would have you believe that "big government" is wasteful. Yes and no. One parties profit is another parties waste and make no mistake, "big government" is extremely profitable if you happen to be the beneficiary of those big fat contracts. And what makes them possible? Debt of course which isn't possible without usury. Get rid of usury and you've solved this problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:04:18
Not really. The market always sorts it out. Look at it a different way: Do you tank the market now by spending or do you tank it gradually by spending small amounts over time? In reality the question is dumb anyway because few actually have this kind of control over their finances, they spend at an extremely controlled rate mostly dictated by their income. The less they have the more they tend to spend.

It might work but you'd be stupid to use it. And actually you might even be stupid to *try* it.  Basically you'd have to act as a third party wallet provider. Even if you could somehow guarantee hard transactions (without reversal) your customers would still have to trust you not to start acting like a fractional reserve. Of course this would undoubtedly happen if you had any losses that you couldn't pass onto your customers. Overall it's just a really bad idea for both you *and* your customers. The benefit of bitcoin is that trust is already baked in. These systems transfer that trust to a third party which becomes a liability.

This is not a flaw in bitcoin, it's a flaw in the fiat monetary system. It's the fiat infrastructure that is requesting these credentials, not bitcoin. 
If the market dictates that these requirements are overly burdensome then bitcoins will be obtained via other forms of trade. Fiat is obviously the most convenient item of trade for bitcoin but literally *anything* of value can be traded as long as two parties are in agreement.

Because *that's* where the money is! This whole revolution thing takes place in stages. Equilibrium has to be reached first, then the usury stops, *then* the poor and impoverished can finally free themselves of years of imperialistic policy and debt slavery. The equilibrium part could happen quickly and necessarily requires the market cap to skyrocket. This causes more people to jump in in order to secure their wealth as fiat continues to tumble against cryptos.

The big problem for smart phones in the US wasn't technology, it was oligarchy on the part of the major carriers. They've done much to bring down the walled garden. Downloadable apps on phones weren't new but they were fewer, expensive, and gave the carrier almost all the revenue. Remember BREW/Java? 
Verizon in particular rejected the iPhone because of this until it started eating into their profits. And what has it done since? Unlimited plans have now greatly cut profits due to a great reduction of nickle and diming. There used to be fees for literally everything. Per minute, overage, text, e-mail, pictures messaging, GPS, tethering, the list goes on. There were often base fees *plus* per use fees.

The theory and indeed the current price suggests they were essentially sold off for cash. But if that's the case where's the paper trail? If so it's a pretty dumb move considering it's far easier to find fiat than it is bitcoins. That much cash would basically have to be laundered out somehow. This is the part that seems so implausible. Anyone who truly "believed" in bitcoin would prefer having them to the cash. Still a giant fiat leak does support at least *some* drop in price but just not this much.

This is already covered under cash policy. And no, the receipt is always used for cash returns *especially* at best buy. This can be overridden of course but when it is the policy is store credit only for the lowest price in the last 90 days. So make sure you have the receipt. Furthermore cash over a certain amount ($200?) is usually not refunded in store rather a check is issued from corporate. This is to reduce possible fraud and/or abuse. A similar policy might also apply to bitcoin should they ever take it. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:19:38
That's just not true *unless* you happen to be in the upper wealth categories of society in which case you're likely already blinded by confirmation bias. 
You need to look at the big picture. With hard money loans are no longer needed. The lack of "easy money" makes prices greatly fall. The best example is student loans. There was a time not very long ago where you could afford to go to college with a part time summer job and still have enough left over for gas and beer money. Would you rather have *that* or a 0% APR student loan? 
Fiat money always looks great in the short term and it is for those who profit off it's usury but it's never sustainable. Along with the labor arbitrage of globalization it creates vast market distortions and wealth disparity. There will always be rich people and poor people. Hard currencies won't change that but it *will* change the spread. Right now there's too many very, very poor people and too few vastly rich people. 
And rich is the biggest understatement the world has ever seen.  We're talking about people who are literally *thousands* of times wealthier than any millionaire. And then you have billionaires telling the millionaires that it's *poor* people taking all their money! Not that I'm crying for them but I'd like people to stop thinking of them as "rich". Yeah, they *are* but they're downright poor compared to *their* "owners".

Bitcoin doesn't change anything. There's plenty of people who hide wealth and don't pay taxes on it. Any "regulation" they try and do will be opt in. They can't regulate bitcoin. They just can't. Even if they could all the liquidity would end up flowing into new cryptos and they can't regulate them all. Besides as a hard currency there will be far fewer rich people with vast bitcoin holdings compared to fiat holdings because you can't collect interest on bitcoin holdings. Furthermore the fiat holdings eventually vanish anyway due to bitcoin. 
Worst case situation is governments go bankrupt but life continues as usual replaced by the private sector. This might normally be a problem under a fiat regime but it's less so because welfare won't really be needed due to far lower wealth disparity. I used to laugh a libertarians *but* I now believe these idea have merit *if* and *only* if the currency is no longer controlled. The reason is that this prevents regulatory capture otherwise known as *reverse* welfare.

@_date: 2014-02-24 03:28:35
My point is that the arbitrage returns on bitcoin are not assured indefinitely and people act like they are. This thinking assumes that a dollar will *always* be worth a dollar when by design the adoption of cryptos brings the real price of a dollar down. 
There are definite issues to reach this level but they have less to do with the actual valuation. The protocol is not fixed and can be expanded upon. It may turn out to be more useful to treat bitcoin as "digital gold" and denominate transactions in a different crypto or basket or cryptos. This is useful if the price of a bitcoin spend gets too high. In this case bitcoin merely becomes a security in a sort of crypto central bank which is essentially what wallet providers already do when they operate off block chain.  Of course this added flexibility can be problematic but in a free market you need to choose your trust wisely. As we've seen with Gox a bad actor won't kill the market but their users certainly won't be happy. This is where the third party trusts come in. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:26:51

There's a failed idea that you can create a prosperous monetary base by injecting money into a community and it magically multiplies just by it's use. Economists *love* this idea for eradicating poverty in the third world but it's never been shown to work.  The poor are poor because they don't have any money, not because the lack a system of trade. You can't just give all these people monopoly money and watch the poverty go away. The value of a currency must be backed by actual labor or resources. A smile is neither of these but it admittedly might provide a psychological benefit. 
Bitcoin works because it's a zero sum game not because it's "magic". It doesn't derive it's value from thin air, it derives it from fiat arbitrage. This is not a one time process nor a perpetual one. (It's value eventualy becomes static.) It's value is gained slowly over time by a process of price discovery. Now I can't deny that the market has placed value on doge but markets are not always rational. Bitcoin is rational by *design* and when it's not it quickly reaches equilibrium. Doge represents everything that's wrong about fiat currency. Even the authors know this which is evident in their decision not to cap the amount created.

No. 2FA makes this extremely difficult. But 2FA makes it harder for the user and laziness is the enemy of good security. The way that developers should (or will?) solve this is with additional verification that reduce risk or eliminate it. When you can't eliminate it you can insure against it through higher wallet fees not unlike what banks do today but with lower fees.   
As far as eliminating the laziness factor you incorporate bio-metric and physical presence verification like GPS or "approved" retail locations.  By using these features you get better rates on "wallet insurance" but the important part is that you don't have to use these at all, they are optional but you are then responsible for your own security. 
These wallet providers or bitcoin banks are going to be important free market tools for getting the wider population to use and trust bitcoin. There will likely be security failures and business failures and there *should* be. Failure is necessary for a healthy marketplace but increasingly they won't be blamed on bitcoin or other crypto.

Bitcoin only continues to rise until equilibrium with other currencies is reached. That could happen *very* quickly or it could happen slowly but once it happens the gravy train is over. *That's* the important part. If everyone adopts bitcoin tomorrow then dollars become worthless thus it won't mater how many dollars a bitcoin is worth. That's what we mean by equilibrium, bitcoins value cannot rise against nothing. We don't know what this "true" valuation is but it should probably be pegged to gold at that point..... assuming gold itself it then pegged to a verifiable ledger and not this paper gold shit. 
So how do we judge equilibrium? The answer is in market cap comparable to other currencies. Realistically we still won't be close until we're talking about a big chunk of M1 or even M2 money supply. We're talking hundreds of trillions of dollars here.... but not just *dollars*. Remember it's a *world* currency. What makes this difficult however is that as market cap rises fiat values fall which then makes market caps in dollars a bad calculation when a loaf of bread is then $100.00.  Basically the trip to the moon starts fast but slows down once it reaches the middle and gets progressively slower by the time it's destination is reached.

In fact I don't expect the (potential) buyer to sell them at all. They would be buying to hold, not sell. The reason being is that the very act of selling would bring the value down. The opposite is true when it comes to auction pricing. The final bid will likely be *higher* than market because of the added value of an off market buy..... precisely for the above stated reason; they won't be selling.  
The zero sum nature of bitcoin really makes the whole prospect of buying to resell a paradox. The very act of buying low bid ensures that the downward price pressure on the market will be higher thus reducing your potential profit on the sale. For this reason any potential buyer knows it will be hard to reliably profit on the market. This buyer also knows they are more valuable held than sold.... which is why they're buying them in the first place. 
tl:dr: These coins effect on the overall market is essentialy already priced in and thus should yield nearly no movement. Of course the markets arn't rational but I would expect anyone in the market for this coin lot to be *extremely* rational.

What I'd really like to know is how these prescription programs actually work on the back end. I've used many and the prices with various programs (albeit free) seem to have no correlation to anything but of course that's true for drug prices to begin with, even generics. I *still* have to juggle pharmacies and discount cards to get the best price.  
The problem I seem to have is that pharmacies can't tell me how much a script will be on any given program, they have to fill it first and then tell me. I suspect this is a major pain in this ass for both them *and* me. 
I suspect all these issues have to do with the extreme lack of transparency in the drug industry.

It's a necessary evil, one created by the conventional monetary system rather than bitcoin itself.  Once money is converted to BTC and it is *itself* used as a currency then this process stops being needed. Think of this as the "upgrading" process from a legacy system to a new one. 
If there's too much crackdown then what will happen is actual goods *instead* will be exchanged for bitcoin instead of monetary instruments (cash). That albeit ironically means that bitcoin won't be the gift card, it will be *sold* for a gift card probably at a larger mark up due to less fungibility.

This "floating unit of account" sounds like a complex form of socialism. Would employers for example be required to pay one "floating unit of rent" per month? If not then how is this variation paid for by people who earn *dollars* and not mystical "floating units of account"? 
The advantage of hard currency is that socialism becomes unnecessary because labor and resources become equitably priced and not one sided by the creation of credit. Credit that is then required to purchase necessities that should already be ~~reasonably~~ easily affordable to the working class. Furthermore *reverse* socialism (socialism of the rich) becomes impossible because debt (including government debt) becomes impossible.

A true libertarian sees that "socialism" cuts *both* ways, in a strictly dollar for dollar amount it tends to favor the rich. Hard money should make socialism for the poor unnecessary because the capital they require to live will no longer be used to oppress them. There will always be rich and poor but it's not the words that mater so much as the disparity between them. It's OK to have some rich people, it's *not* OK to have people exponentially richer than everyone else. It creates liquidity traps and stalls the economy which is exactly what we're seeing now. It discourages saving the encourages conspicuous consumption, wasted resources, and externalities. Entire categories of social and environmental problems are eliminated with hard currency because it quite literally prevents borrowing from the future.

Bitcoin is indeed a currency. Too many people continue to see it as an intermediate store of value. It need not remain an intermediate because as soon as people discover they are paying exchange fees for no reason they will stop. 
It's in their own self interest to compel their preferred merchants to accept bitcoin. Ultimately they will because there's more downside to *not* accepting it. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:14:22
It's an useful idea but I should caution that most of these services (including this one) don't let you add cash *directly* with bitcoin. Instead you have to buy a type of transfer voucher from a third party and *then* load it to the card which usually has it's own fees.... usually 1-3% on top of what they charge for loading. If you want to know how these cards and the various payment transfer services work check out okpay.com. They have a very detailed explanation..... and high verification requirements. 
I know of only a few cards that let you top them with bitcoin directly, they usually have a high flat rate fee to order the card but more flexible and lower fees for loading The best looks to be one out of Poland and don't quote me but it seems like it was about $50 and let you load up to $3500 (a year?) with very little (no?) verification. It's said to work internationally and allow ATM cash withdrawals. 
The big trade off you're making is fees vs. loading flexibility. OKPay for example charges $2.99 (?) per load, even if you want to just load a few dollars. That means you're incentivised to load larger amounts to save on fees. The problem of course is that this lowers your bitcoin holdings.  
The big advantage of these cards is that they let you operate bankless and in some cases anonymously in addition to letting you easily obtain cash and/or a point of sale purchase balance almost instantly albeit with high fees. If you don't mind the wait time it's cheaper just to cash out on coinbase in a fee free bank or credit union account. 
These cards might be good for small daily purchases like your coffee, groceries, gas, etc. or most importantly for emergencies if you happen to have large bitcoin holdings but no credit cards or just bad credit..... or if you *really* hate banks so much you refuse to deal with them at all. Due to the fees I would greatly avoid making more than a few hundred dollars a month in purchases with them. 
In the end these are transition instruments that allow third parties to profit and should probably be avoided if possible. You're doing both yourself *and* the merchant a favor by encouraging them just to take bitcoin directly.  
Edit, I believe this is the card I'm referring to:
