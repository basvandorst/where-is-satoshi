Often forgotten when compared to cash or gold -- bitcoin can not be forged

You can not block transactions, because you do not claim block space, you bid for it. Any one who is willing to pay higher fee will have their transaction in next block, regardless of how many lower fee transactions are in mempool. If you really wanted to block transaction in bitcoin, instead of giving money to miners each 10 minutes, you better off acquiring around 30% of hash rate, then you can censor transaction and be profitable.

 "Your private keys are all stored locally and synced across all of your devices over a one-time-password protected channel. Using this approach we can ensure even in the event of an attack against Tetra servers your funds remain totally unaffected." That is not really p2p, and I rather not transmitt private key over network.

Transactions dropped from mempool eventually become invalid, if their outputs used in other transaction

Two wrongs do not make one right. The only difference between admin and scammer is -- admin scammed successfully, but scammer failed. You get the idea, they are same. I would not shown this log to anyone, implying that it is something good or right.

Tom Zander is literally complaining that bitcoin network is too decentralized

You convert your bitcoins into XSpoct note, which is basically a file. Then you transfer ownership, updating note and making "fake/dust" on chain transaction. As far as I understand, you can not convert XSpoct note back to bitcoin unspend output, which is show stopper!

This is not funny anymore. It is an act of aggresion.

If you have control of your private keys, then you good to go. Just avoid sending or receiving transactions on Segwit2x fork day -- 16 November.
About forks: bitcoin attracts lots of attention. Bitcoin itself is a ledger on network of deployed software. Software mostly developed by bitcoin core project. Some people disagree with design decision made by bitcoin core leads. Some times they can come to compromise with bitcoin core leads, some times can not. Then people have an option -- fork bitcoin core repository, and do it as they see fit. This is not the fork you are hearing about. But, when they disagree about consensus rules -- this calls for another fork, this time ledger has to be duplicated and deployed network software partitioned. Bitcoin cash has done this cleanly, with no disruption, duplicating ledger and taking minor part of network. Segwit2x upcoming fork will duplicate ledger, and take small amount of network too, but unlike previous forks, it intends to force rest of network to their implementation via threat of hashrate starvation. You see, unfortunately bitcoin mining is very centralized at the moment and segwit2x proponents have majority of hashrate in their hands. But instead of doing boring 51 attack, that actually sort of useless, they trying to take control of bitcoin development process.
