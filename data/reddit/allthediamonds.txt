@_date: 2014-10-14 11:38:14
The phones don't "send up location data". They connect to cell towers, whose placement is known by the phone companies, which allows them to triangulate an estimation of your position.

Uh, cold stashes wouldn't be safe either; a bitcoin address is derived from its corresponding public key. Assuming a magic device that could bruteforce keys, there's nothing that makes cold storage safer.
Of course, that's also not how quantum computing works, so don't worry.

I'll take a look at the link you provided and come back if I find anything. Buttercoin provides no source (then again, neither do I) so I can't confirm anything.
The random component I mention is part of the ECDSA signature. See here:
On step 3 of the example given on that page, you can see:


And later on, the same vulnerability I described, with the PS3 reference and everything (I think this is where I learned about it)

My point is that this isn't exclusive to Litecoin. A botnet generates a lot of profit mining litecoins. It could also generate a lot of profit mining bitcoins.

If it ends with -a and it doesn't start with -a, it's feminine; otherwise, it's masculine. This breaks with things that are explicitly gendered, such as "La mujer" but works otherwise.
So, the correct form would be "el bitcoin", and whoever said "la bitcoin" is likely forcing concordance in gender along the whole phrase (which most native speakers do without noticing because it often happens to be that way) and saying "esta moneda (**la** moneda) se llama **la** bitcoin" The natural thing to do when genders don't match (for example, "**la** moneda se llama **el** florín") is to omit the gender, but, with new words, it's not uncommon to force concordance.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:01:23
No, it is not. A hash is useful in situations in which you need to confirm that you and a second party have the same information without disclosing that very information (or without having to store that information, choosing to store the hash instead; which is why it is used for passwords)

I have a Mac too, and installing Ubuntu in it was quite a painful process last time I tried.
If you're interested in development, though, it can't hurt to boot up a virtual (x)Ubuntu with VirtualBox or Vagrant. You'll find that it works great with Python right out of the box.

You know that there are other languages aside from Java and C++, right?
Java is not a security risk. Oracle's Java Virtual Machine is.


Error prone, sure. I could probably agree on dangerous. But "bug-ridden"? I don't think the standard C++ libraries are "bug-ridden" by any means.
Anyway, I'm not looking forward to defend C++.

People tell lies on the internet. Don't trust OP (nor me) and do your own research.
That said, to answer your questions:
Yes, bitcoins are divisible. The smallest subdivision is 1/10000000 of a Bitcoin, which is often called a Satoshi. The most practical subdivision right now is the mBTC, that is, 1/1000 of a bitcoin.
To convert between Bitcoin and your local currency is the same as converting between oranges and apples: you find someone who wants your oranges and trade your oranges to apples. There are websites where you can do this, such as coinbase.com.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:12:28
Nope: the miners aren't sending the blocks themselves, just doing work on hashes. BTC Guild could create a "evil block" and send work on it to the miners.

It would be possible, but current pool mining software knows nothing about the blockchain. For all it knows, it could be computing SHA256 just for the laughs.

I believe I have quite an understanding of how Bitcoin works. I've been following it in varying degrees of intensity for a few years, and, while I discover something new about Bitcoin every day, I believe my knowledge of Bitcoin's inner workings is more than sufficient.
Security... I definitely struggle with that, especially the sysadmin-related part. I do well enough to manage my personal-use VPS without blowing up the whole datacenter, but I definitely would appreciate a helping hand.
Legislation... I'm not in the US, and the EU has said nothing about Bitcoin yet. My service would manage only cryptocoins, no fiat money, so there shouldn't be a problem as long as I pay my taxes if/when I cash out, right?

*Note: In my original comment, "Are bitcoiners this dumb?" referred to most other comments in this thread, not to OP specifically.*
Well, one could argue that "public verifiability" and "a certain degree of anonimity" are opinions about how currency should be. Other political ideas  of Bitcoin:
"you own your own money" (this is a powerful, ground-breaking and in my opinion beautiful one)
"supply is limited" (which goes along with "value is in scarcity")
"transactions must not be reversible"
"central authorities are detrimental to the quality of a currency"
Also, nitpicking: the MP3 codec is hardly an open standard.

Definitely, most people don't have a clue about crypto.
If you salt the IP, then the hash turns out to be completely meaningless unless you also release the salt. And, if you also release the salt, then salting does nothing. We're not working against pre-made rainbow tables here: hashing everything from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 would probably take less than an hour with a modern GPU. And so will hashing 0.0.0.0somerandomsalt to 255.255.255.255somerandomsalt.

Nope. It is run on Java. Which is completely unlike JavaScript. Two different beasts there.

Android does not use Oracle's Java Virtual Machine (which is the reason Java is broadly considered a security risk) but a custom bytecode compiler.
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:23:25
What? No. Using one address is bad for several reasons:
Implementation-wise, you need the user to send a signed message in order to link the sending address to the user, given that transactions are public. This is a burden for the user. Using several addresses (one per user) fixes this. You generate a new address for each user, and if the address receives money then you know that money comes from the user.
On the user's side, using one address is bad because (again, since transactions are public) it can be used to keep track of your spendings. In order to help preserve anonimity, most Bitcoin clients spend all outputs and send the remaining bitcoins to a new address.
However, using the same address twice (or N times) does not pose a security risk at all in the way thieflar described. As long as the random component of the signing changes every time the address is used, there is no hazard in re-using address. Not changing this component (which, in the case of Bitcoin, is done automatically by the client) is what allowed to recover the private key of the PlayStation 3 encryption system.
