Why are you telling anyone that you're into it?

The number of people I've seen on reddit alone who are "researching" crytpo is hilarious.

He’s definitely wrong.  Even more competitive negotiated rates are around 2pct plus monthly fees, so unless he is pricessing only $850 a month he is wrong

Odd, since I've seen so many friends joke about payment for sex or some variant and have never been questioned.

While wedding rings are a ripoff, I did recently find one redeeming value:  in some states, wedding rings fall under property exemptions in cases of lawsuits, bankruptcy, etc.

Everyone has to assess their own risk, but to me that is life changing money.  I'd sell at least $400k of it and put it towards a house or education and let the other $80k ride as a gamble.
Also if you do sell keep in mind taxes.  That means you'd prob have to sell less (say 300k), and pay $80-$100k of taxes on it or whatever.

Agree and this tweet is absurd.  Software development is hard as it is, let alone introducing complex math and cryptographic concepts.
Access to materials to learn might be wide open, but without intelligence and a lot of time no casual dev is going to create a new coin.
Embed a plug and play crypto framework into some app to support payment?  Ok I can buy that.

My safari guide in Kruger National Park asked how he could get rich off of bitcoin

How do they qualify gains?  How do they know what came from the currency appreciation vs original price vs payments from others?
