It does not matter whether Ledger goes out of business. The seed words can be used with many other wallets.

The Lightning Network consists of channels between the users. A channel is what connects you to the rest of the network.

ASIC resistancy is not necessarily good. In fact, it makes it less costly to attack the network since you can buy CPUs/GPUs, attack the network, and then sell your stuff with little loss. This is not possible with ASICs. Basically, ASICs are the ultimate proof of stake in some sense.

I read that the verification of segwit transactions is faster than non-segwit transactions (I'm actually not completely sure why, is it because of the quadratic hashing problem?).
So it's a little bit less worse than replacing segwit with a "normal" blocksize increase but generally speaking I think you are correct.

It's not because the thing you destroy with an attack will make your chips useless and nobody will buy them.


The opposite is the case, this is what makes an attack more viable, you can simply sell the GPUs afterwards to some gamers or whatever.
Oh, and you can simply attack the network by using malware on peoples computers. This is also much more difficult with ASICs.

Very good post.


I'm not sure about that. If I would be convinced that I would lose money by holding Bitcoin, I probably would not hold it. However, I see the immense value in the tech that promises to improve a flawed system (and offer new possible applications), and in the Bitcoin community that will pull through together. One of the inevitable consequences is that Bitcoin will continue to grow.

@_date: 2018-01-08 00:28:56


No, they don't. It is very simple: If they don't use Segwit, they pay more network fees than other exchanges like Bitstamp.
Those fees don't just vanish into thin air. Someone has to pay them. Exchanges compete for customers. At some point, some other exchange can and will provide lower fees for the customer. Then, people will graduately stop using the expensive exchange.
There is no need for us to "force" someone to behave well. Capitalism will do it for us. Either you adapt, or you die.

You cannot do a Lightning Network transaction without your counterparty. Both sides must sign the transaction with their private keys. This happens off-chain and is therefore instant. Only transactions signed by both sides are valid and can be used to settle the LN channel balance on the Blockchain later.

Unfortunately, if I say that there are no technical downsides, a Bitcoin Cash shill (sorry) will come and claim that Segwit is insecure and what not. My opinion is there are no technical downsides but there are certain non-technical downsides (if you want to call it like that):
- It's backwards compatibel and therefore opt-in. Unfortunately that means a number of things:
Bitcoin newbies might use the old format even though segwit profits them (I made this mistake when I first set up my Ledger Nano Wallet).
Furthermore, there is less incentive for businesses to implement segwit. They can always keep their old legacy infrastructure and push the blame for high fees to Bitcoin (e.g., Coinbase, Bitpay, etc. do this)
- Segwit fixes covert asicboost. This is a patented method used by Bitmain (the producer of the antminers and big mining pool operator) to "cheat" and produce hashes faster in a way not intended by the Bitcoin developers. Hence, Bitmain (or more precisely a buddy of Jihan Wu) introduced Bitcoin Cash where asicboost is still possible, and Bitmain supports this fork.

Much respect. I also installed a full node on a raspberry pi this month.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:24:56
There is nothing for free, especially not security. Verification in Tangle systems is also based on proof of work where pow is performed on the devices themselves. In iota for example, you verify transactions when you do transactions. So basically you don't pay miners for their electricity but you pay for your own electricity. 
Admittedly this might currently be lower but with L2 and L3 solutions on Bitcoin there might come a point where your electricity cost for performing Tangle transactions might exceed the cost of paying for opening channels and performing fee-less L2/L3 transactions.
Edit: Obviously, the proponents of DAG based solutions never mention this (or they don't think far enough, idk).

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

More precisely, you need to upload (in average) more than you download, independently of what the actual bandwidth is :)


I'm not so sure. Why did the S2X fork fail? I wouldn't rule out the possibility that the full nodes of the community played some role in it. You cannot spin the narrative very convincingly that the majority wants the fork when almost all nodes are supporting the current chain. If there were no such nodes, the fork might possibly have succeeded, I don't know.


@_date: 2018-01-03 20:34:38
Every node has its own mempool and people can configure how large it can be at max. Roger should hire better sockpuppets to be honest. :]

@_date: 2018-01-12 21:44:57
That's not the point. As the user you have to be willing to use a watchtower if you want to receive payments. The alternative is to ask the user with a popup or something when they first want to accept one. That's annoying, I only want to send payments, nothing else.
Edit: I personally will use a "normal" LN wallet (possibly connected to my own Bitcoin node), I just say that I'd also like to see a super lightweight wallet with just this simply functionality: Sending payments. If nobody does it, I will fork some wallet and implement it myself. :)

The correct fee depends on the number of unspent inputs. I don't know how many you have. (Even if I knew, there are more steps like using a wallet with custom fees and predicting a correct fee by taking a look at the mempool.)

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:44:54
It is attractive for people sending large amounts of money from one country to another. It is attractive for people living in countries with large inflation. It is not attractive for micro payments. No blockchain based technology will be if we still want to keep the most important property that is decentralization. The only viable way is by using second layer solutions like the lightning network that uses a decentralized network as level 1 and implements scaling on level 2 (or 3).

I can't do that where I live. :&lt; As soon as my bitcoins leave my hands and I get something of value in return - taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:17:20
That's correct but if you have the possibility to accept payments you cannot per default not use a watchtower (or you have to monitor the blockchain yourself). If you have a wallet type (or even just a channel) where there is no possibility to accept payments, you simply don't need a watchtower.
I for one want to be able to be absolute secure without relying on a third party and without monitoring the blockchain. Since I don't need to accept payments on my phone LN wallet, my proposed solution works for me.

Oh, ok, now I understand what UniqueCandy meant. I assumed that he implies that Segwit addresses clash with S2X addresses and his coins get "overwritten" by S2X or something like that. You are obviously right. That said, there won't be a fork post-segwit that do not support segwit because of acceptance and price reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:36:12
That was already clear during the S2X fiasco and people here even then continued to recommend coinbase for God knows what reason. Now that all the newbies only know coinbase the whole situation is fucked up.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:09:14
segwit: Change of the transaction format which fixes a malleability problem, enables new technologies like lightning network and schnorr signatures via softfork, makes validation of blocks faster, and costs less fees via the way a segwit transaction increases the block size.

@_date: 2018-01-27 23:06:28
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. 
More precisely, exchanges get hacked all the time. On multiple occasions people lost money because of that. You only have power over your own bitcoin when they are on a bitcoin address you control yourself with your private key. A wallet (not online wallet) holds your private key on your own device.
P.S.: Don't use desktop wallets, they are insecure because your PC is insecure. Also don't use the bitcoin.com wallet.

You don't get paid to be a node, you might collect some very small amount of fees when people use your node to route transactions. You need a device that is online to do that.
In any case, leaving a channel open does not hurt. You can use the channel later for other purchases.

I'm confused, first paragraph: "you are assuming that he has more upload than download"
Second paragraph: "i think that could be the reason why we see a lot more upload than download on most nodes."
What am I missing?
Anyway, I think full nodes also value in a non-technical sense. By running a full node you show support for a certain protocol. I know that you can easily fake those by spinning them up on AWS (like S2X supporters did), and they cannot enforce a protocol on the rest of the network, but still.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:56:38

You always need an opening transaction on-chain, at least in the normal LN we are talking about. There are some other solutions where LN is pushed to layer 3 and layer 2 is either some kind of pooling solution (or similar) or a Bitcoin sidechain.
However, generally speaking, you never want a layer 2 solution where you have to trust the other party because that is economically infeasible. LN is great because it's trustless.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:39:46
When you open a channel, you and the node you connect to both lock funds on the Bitcoin blockchain using a smart contract (timelock). These funds can only be used for the channel. Some time before the timelock expires, you settle the current balance on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's not fractional reserve or something like that.

You have no clue how Bitcoin works. Full nodes are the only instance making sure that you as an economic node are on the network you expect to be. Otherwise miners can change the rules as they like.

Most wallets use high fees because they don't know better for one reason or the other. I transferred my btc a few hours ago from non-segwit addresses to a segwit address. My ledger nano s suggested high fees too but ledger has the option to use a custom fee. 10 sat/byte were sufficient.
Maybe electrum has that option too? Maybe it has an advanced mode or something like that?

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

- first mover advantage
- oldest and most reliable crypto currency
- best developer team, everyone can submit code and when the community and the reviews agree it's good, it's incorporated
- is always evolving but not so unreasonably fast that breaking bugs are incorporated into the code
- most secure since most proof of work, and most full nodes
- deflationary by design in contrast to other crypto currencies
- allows second and third layer solutions which will scale beyond any other crypto currency in current existence
- will gobble up most other crypto currencies in form of side chains eventually
- Satoshi Nakamoto

It's completely simple to brute-force it, even if you leave out a word at some arbitrary point in the chain. In fact, if I recall correctly, the last three words or so are used as a checksum, so leaving out one word is actually completely meaningless since you can compute it deterministically with ease.

This has nothing to do with Lightning Network. It's delegated proof of stake if I'm not mistaken.
Also: Yay for another airdrop. But what do they try to achieve? Even 12x the transaction speed (as they claim) cannot solve the scalability problem in the long run.

I guess I didn't understand the explanation of Segwit then. The witness data is segregated but still in the block. Where is it segregated to if not to the end of the block?
Edit: Ok, it's segregated to the end of the transaction, not to the end of the block, that makes sense. Sorry for spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:03:12
I don't understand the problem to be honest. Every price is a function of supply and demand. Someone demands too much bitcoin for the pc, then someone else will build another pc and sell for less bitcoin. That's how an equilibrium price is determined. Nothing changes compared to how price is determined today. It doesn't matter wether there is a finite cap or not.

But almost nobody uses it anyway at the current time. We will get there, when two things happen:
- Second layer solutions are established
- the price has been risen so high that it has become a stable currency people are willing to spend freely

He most likely means the way which utxo to use for transactions leaving coinbase to customer wallets. If you never consolidate the change, then you end up with utxos holding very few coins that cannot be used anymore due to transaction fees.
It's like when you always pay for 99 cent items with 1 dollar and end up having a million 1 cent coins and the bank charges 1 cent for each coin you want to change back into 1 dollar bills.

Certainly in the long run. Note though, that adoption drives adoption. At the beginning, nobody will use it. It needs time.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:07:30
Why are many of the answers so bad/off topic?
It's simple: Miners get two things, new Bitcoins and transaction fees.
When no new Bitcoins are issued, they will only get the transaction fees. If the transaction fees are too low, then some miners will stop mining, and the remaining miners will get those fees. It does not matter how low the fees get, some people will always mine.

Moore's law seems to slow down, Bitcoin adoption could increase too fast for it to catch up, and there are countries where you still have horrible internet even after all these years. Also, we need multiple magnitudes if we want to scale world-wide. How many years do you want to wait until moore's law has catched up? 2^x = 10^k, where k is the numbers of magnitude increase and x is the number of 18-month-batches you need to wait.


I'd like to add that it is not only a maleability fix but it allows protocol upgrades without hardfork. You can add for example Schnorr signatures as softfork which is awesome.

No, the transaction went through, but the website said that there was an error with the transaction. I actually tried it twice. The first time the website told me to write a longer article after I did the transaction. Then I did this, paid again, and the website told me that there was an error. The message was very short. I try it again later today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:25


I don't get this part.


So, they figure out, a pc should cost 0.0001 bitcoin based on chain analysis. Then suddenly someone else sells for 0.00008 bitcoin. What now? I just don't get it. It's just supply and demand and competition that pushes the price to the marginal cost. There is nothing special about Bitcoin or its cap in the same way there is nothing special about gold. And gold was used as a currency a few hundred years ago. Nothing special.

No, but sidechains of bitcoin might disrupt these tokens. Rootstock for example is a bitcoin sidechain and enables smart contracts in the vein of Ethereum.

Segwit is an elegant short term solution for high fees. As long as people and in particular exchanges are not using it, the problem can't be as big as people claim it to be.
That said, larger blocks will necessarily come, they are just not needed right now. And who knows when they will be needed, considering we can scale even higher with Lightning Network on Level 3 instead of Level 2.

I'm also somewhat perturbed that Cobra didn't even entertain the idea that the second layer will reduce the pressure on the blockchain, and that the second layer is not meant for every single transaction but for buying your daily coffee instead.

Because everyone wants to transact. Also because Coinbase does not support segwit, which would make the transactions much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:28:30
So, you simply decide that in reality people don't use Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper, even though the reason the fees are so high is that people actually use it in contrast to Bcash.

I posted this in another thread:
High fees imply high demand. As long as Bitcoin has high fees, it's not going to die.
Scaling with blocksize comes with the cost of centralization. A blockchain derives it's value from being decentralized.
Bitcoin is the most secure, the most decentralized crypto currency, with the best development team.
It will scale at a later point in time, and when it starts to scale it will blow every currency altcoin out of the water.
Maybe even coins like Ethereum with sidechains like Rootstock.
By the way, it might be counter intuitive but from my point of view there are roughly three phases for a currency coin:
- the beginning: Nobody uses the coin, nobody gives a shit, fees are low, it can be used as a currency
- the adoption phase: People are flooding into the currency, fees are high, it cannot scale, it is very volatile, it cannot be used as a currency, its price increases, it's becoming a store of value
- the endgame: The currency scales on layers two and three, it can process millions of transactions per second, its volatility is small, it can be used as a currency
Bitcoin is in phase 2 and slowly approaching phase 3. All other crypto currencies are in phase 1.

I slightly disagree with some posts.
PC wallets are insecure, a keylogger or virus can steal private keys and passphrases.
Phone wallets are the second most secure solution.
Hardware wallets are the most secure solution.
A paper wallet ist only safe as long as the private key is not used to send money. After that it has to be assumed compromised if a PC is used to send.

It has to do with transactions of the form A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C (A,B,C being addresses), which cannot be compressed in the same block, or something like that.

Yes, because each word either constitutes to the seed or is used as a checksum word. Obviously, you cannot skip the checksum because the checksum is needed to check whether the previous words are correct. However, you can compute the checksum from the rest because it is a checksum. At least that is what I read. Maybe my information was wrong on this?

Half the price pressure by miners. 60k is exaggerated, though. Imho, we will get to the $14k - $16k range mid 2020. (Take $6500 today as a stable base line, half the btc supply, a bit more sell pressure by long term holders, but more demand by new people entering bitcoin, and possibly ETFs).

One immediate problem is that you use your PC to store and use your keys. That's not blockchain.info specific but a general problem with many wallets. Don't use a wallet where the keys are exposed to the internet either through an online wallet or your PC.
As almost always the case, a hardware wallet is the best compromise between security and convenience. Ledger and Trezor support Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:05:31

We'll get to 20k in two years at the next halfing. Until then most of the MtGox coins will be absorbed by hodlers and the supply will dry up. Also, the infrastructure and the amount of people contributing to Bitcoin's network effects will have increased, providing a stable basis.

Bad stocks aren't necessarily bad investments. The same is true for shitcoins. You can make a huge amount of money if you get in and out at the correct times.
For long term investment: Concentrate on what they promise and what they actually deliver. Ask yourself if the business model is viable. In particular ask whether you need decentralization or a token to achieve the same.

Good question. I for one would care as much about BCH as I care about any other CC in this case: basically not at all.
But we must stay vigilant, and lies about the viability of the tech must be called out. The reason is that you can claim all sort of things like decentralization and censorship resistance until reality catches up. But that could take a while, and all the while people are led to believe these claims are true.
It's like selling this bomb detector thing:
Nobody is hurt, maybe for quite some time, until something blows up in your vincinity.

An audit is not what I'm referring to. Lack of analysis is more on the line what I mean. For me it feels insecure and sybil-attackable, but there are people who understand nano better than me who can identify other problems.

The price of Bitconnect was somewhere around $250 before it collapsed. The returns of Bernie Madoff's fund were enormous until it collapsed. Why do you think that price necesseraly tells us anything meaningful about the true value and sustainability of an asset, especially when it can be manipulated quite easily in the case of cryptocurrencies, in particular with those having comparatively low liquidity and depth like BCH?
The answer: Dumb money.
P.S.: What the whitepaper says is irrelevant in this context since all the network effects are on Bitcoin's side, and since BCH is led by liars, criminals and frauds intelligent money will stay out of it.
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:23:16
Flippening means that the price (and consequently the hash rate) of BCH overtakes that of BTC. However, this will never happen because
(a) BCH is centralized on all metrics and compromised w.r.t. future development. This implies less security and nobody with half a brain would invest long term into this currency. BTC has "holder's of last resort". BCH doesn't have this kind of culture.
(b) the higher the BCH:BTC ratio, the harder it becomes to pump the ratio higher. Roger/Jihan need to pay more and more BTC to buy BCH. This will not work in the long run. A high BCH:BTC ratio only means, you can get more BTC if you still have your BCH. (Not necessarily a bad bet but not one I am going to take.)
(c) a very large amount of BCH is held by Jihan's mining pools. This is a constant threat for everyone holding BCH. If they decide to dump, *you* are the bagholder.

@_date: 2018-05-06 16:20:55
(a) That has literally nothing to do with what I said.
(b) Not more but a huge amount. Roger is said to have 300k BTC, the artificial floor at 0.12 BCH/BTC was obvious a few months ago. I don't know how much BTC Jihan has, but considering the fact that he does not use his BCH to pay for electricity (as shown in the article linked above), he pays in BTC. So his BTC holdings in absolute amounts are much lower than his BCH holdings.
(c) Because you don't just dump everything at once, that only leads to flash crashes with reasonably fast recovery as shown many times. Also, Jihan most likely just uses BCH as a nice side business for now. He is intelligent in contrast to Roger, which is obvious if you follow their tweets.

@_date: 2019-11-08 20:45:19
Okay, I think you are right, according to 
But honestly, that doesn't make much sense to fix outgoing connections to 8 imho. Basic graph theory tells us that the *total* number of outgoing connections (over all clients) equals the *total* number of incoming connections (over all clients), so the only way that I can have more incoming than outgoing connections is if there are other clients that have less incoming than outgoing connections.
I don't get it. And I'm not going to open my router for traffic from the internet. And I'm going to use my windows system for validating the chain, the node itself will run on a Raspberry Pi.

@_date: 2019-11-08 21:33:06
Every open port is a potential security hole. If, for example, bitcoin core has an exploit then with incoming connections my node can specifically be targetted by an attacker.
Anyway, I decided to open the ports because it's so fricking slow. I tried adding supposedly fast nodes with the addnode option but it didn't increase the speed.

In this case it is, see other comments.

@_date: 2019-11-08 21:34:13

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.
The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.
Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."
And off he walked very, very scornfully.

The hashrate part was wrong. Hashrate always follows price: due to the difficulty adjustment, the amount of money spent on hashrate/electricity per hour always roughly equals the amount of newly minted bitcoin per hour times the price. An exception are extreme bullruns where hashrate lags behind due to inelasticity in mining hardware production, etc.
Additionally, the labor theory of value is wrong. Just because I spend a huge amount of effort digging holes beside the street doesn't mean I can sell them for big money.

Most answers here are wrong, the hate does not come from supporting BCH trading but from supporting the recent Segwit2X fork attempt (which was later cancelled, then done regardless, and burned in a fire due to horrible bugs in the Segwit2X client code). Many people, including me, believe that the Segwit2X agreement was about gaining control of the bitcoin code/network and getting rid of the succesful and responsible core developers. Since Coinbase and other S2X supporters camouflaged their support as trying to scale bitcoin, people are pointing out the hypocracy that Coinbase is not even able to scale their own exchange properly (and also, they don't use Segwit, which is a scaling solution already available).

Generally speaking, if the other node is compromised and sends you the wrong chain, you can check whether the proof of work contained in the chain is big enough.
A compromised node can never send you a chain with enough proof of work because in order to construct such a chain they would need a huge amount of miners and electricity.
By the way, that's an important advantage of proof of work over proof of stake where you (depending on the precise scheme) cannot be sure to have the correct chain.

@_date: 2018-03-04 01:46:53


First step, first mistake. Basically every decision coinbase and gdax make are directed against bitcoin and their customers. May it be pushing segwit2x, delaying segwit and batching as much as possible, hurting their own customers with the way they introduced Bcash trading (currently on court) or other shit (some things also on court like keeping peoples money/bitcoin agains law). If you have the opportunity, you may want to switch any other fiat-on-ramp, e.g., Bitstamp.
That said, buying a hardware wallet like Trezor is a very good decision.

@_date: 2019-01-12 21:28:49
Primarily it has nothing to do with time but with functions. O, Theta, Omega are not "highest", "average" and "lowest", but "asymptotically at most", "asymptotically same", and "asymptotically at least". When you use O-notation with algorithms, it's mostly used for indicating upper bounds on the worst-case time. It doesn't make sense to say "the number is asymptotically at most n²" because that doesn't rule out that it's asymptotically at most n. So, no, it's not the same as "don't" versus "do not". It's wrong, plain and simple.

Larger hardware/network requirements = less people able to run economic full nodes = less economic nodes able to protect the consensus rules of the network = mining pools being able to decide the protocol without user consent = anything bad can happen (e.g., increasing the max number of coins, the central parties being shut down by governments, etc.).
Also, we don't need a centralized solution, we already have one. And I trust the current system much more than criminals and frauds that are the leading supporters of Bcash, sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:34:53
You are completely correct, and that's what many people are not understanding: that miners are the customers of the users, and their only duty is to secure the network. Miners don't have the power to decide the protocol, otherwise we wouldn't have Segwit and we would have big blocks.

The chain with the most accumulated POW can change back and forth. You introduced an arbitrary criterion of some minimum amount of time but this does not help to decide what is Bitcoin, it still can switch.
Also, miners don't have any say in this. Miners are used to secure the network not to decide what is Bitcoin. Miners can mine at a loss for a hundred years for all I care, it won't make their coin Bitcoin if the users don't agree. Or maybe it does. It does not matter.

I've no final opinion about Turing complete smart contracts, yet. So far, though, I've not seen a single application involving those kind of smart contracts that excites me. Keep in mind that non-Turing complete smart contracts are also supported by Bitcoin.
Time will tell if Turing completeness is something the marked demands and is willing to pay for. That said, if that ever turns out to be the case, Bitcoin can use TC smart contracts on side chains. Rootstock as a first attempt at this comes to mind (note that its pegging mechanism is supposedly insecure but I can't comment on this).
I'm not judging what Vitalik should or should not do. In the end, he can do what he wants.

Miners don't decide which blocks are valid, fully validating nodes do.
If the blocks he builds upon are invalid, his new blocks are invalid, too. His invalid blocks are rejected by fully validating nodes, i.e., the network rejects his blocks, i.e., he wastes money.

You should not use any word from a dictionary as the 25th word. If you do and your 24 words get compromised, it's easy to calculate each seed for each dictionary word and test if there are coins on it. Otoh, if it's a word that cannot be guessed or looked up, your coins are safe even if the 24 words are compromised. In any case, I still agree to use different 24 words just in case.

The advantage is the reduced variance. But it's merely semantics at this point. :)

By DCA you reduce your personal EV but also reduce your personal variance. Nobody is disputing that going all-in immediately has the largest EV if we assume (a) a purely random time for the investment and (b) a positive EV in general. DCAing for the reduced variance still makes sense.

Yes, it does. The hash rate (sans mining hardware improvement) corresponds to the amount of electricity miners have to buy, and thus the amount of bitcoin miners have to sell to cover their cost. Thus, a high hash rate corresponds to a large amount of fresh money entering the system. If this money dries up, both the price and the hash rate must necessarily fall in this dynamic system.
Furthermore, hash rate is always lagging behind large price increases due to the inability to produce new competitive mining hardware at the same pace. So, when price goes up very fast, the current miners can sell just a few bitcoin to cover the cost, and keep excess bitcoin. Due to new miners entering the game and the difficulty adjustment, they are eventually forced to sell almost all newly mined bitcoin.
Btw, I didn't read the article, but the conclusion the author is drawing is correct.
