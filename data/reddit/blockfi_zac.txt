BlockFi also does 50% LTV on BTC

Hi Alec18,
It depends on the initial LTV.  A 10K loan at a 20% initial LTV would cost 4.5% a year.  The calculator currently only shows pricing at a 50% LTV.

Correct, the 4.5% interest rate does not include the origination fee, which ranges from .5-2%.  The point of getting the lower interest rate is to reduce the cost of the credit.  For example, let's say you want $200K to buy an investment property.  You have 1M of Bitcoin.  You could get 200K at ~5.5% all in which is cheaper than most bank financing for investment properties in the US.  Going with the lower LTV, lower interest rate option creates a better ROI on your investment property net of the cost of capital vs if you went with a higher interest rate option.

Whether or not any type of loan makes sense for someone is a personal choice!  If you look at analogous products in the traditional financial sector, they have an adoption rate of &lt;10%.  
BlockFi loans have gone out to people that are using the funds to buy real estate, diversify their investments, start businesses etc while still holding on to the upside in their crypto.  We recently posted some testimonlials from clients - 
It might not be for everyone, but having this functionality is definitely an overall positive for the ecosystem!

The crypto would be sold in pieces on the way down..so you wouldn't owe fiat, you just wouldn't have the crypto anymore

Yes.  Let's say you're someone in Argentina who holds Bitcoin.  You don't want to spend your Bitcoin.  What is you could spend a credit line, denominated in USD, at a low interest rate that you were never able to access before.  This is powerful and a great utility for BTC

Well it's different by market depending on credit availability.  In the US, it's just a way to get more BTC in peoples hands by swapping BTC for Amex points / cash back.  In emerging markets, it's a way to offer a low interest rate card vs. the crazy high interest rates - or just complete lack of availability that currently exists.  In US it's a credit card in EM it's a collateralized personal loan with the loan disbursement done via a physical card (which makes it easier to spend an also enables you to keep it in USD - vs a bank transfer where it will get converted to local currency)
