I sold my bfl Jalapeno on ebay last year. I got a very early preorder and got £1300 on ebay, I was one of the first groups of shipments. I know the difficulty was about to skyrocket (It's now like 1000x more today)
Edit: 266% difficulty increase

I've had good success with them. All my transfers came from the UK.
They seem to be a very primitive company however, I don't think the sites founders had any previous experience in similar businesses before the company was formed so expect a lot of further teething issues.
