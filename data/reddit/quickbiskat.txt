Really the determining factor is does every person on the planet have the ability or the knowledge to be able to use bitcoin. Right now it’s hard to buy, easy to lose, and having to go thru all the hassle just to make sure you’re key is secure and never lost is a real turn off to people. Try convincing anyone about 50 how to do that and you’re talking a different language to them. I do agree that BTC will have its place in our world. But to think it will be adopted by everyone is unrealistic.

Military gets free schooling anyway. So I don’t really understand what debt they are paying off..

Seeing how your how a multi millionaire then.. Pay off your debt and even if you have to pay taxes so what. Keep some as an investment and use the rest to go enjoy a awesome life of not giving a fuck. This is a no brainer.

But the GI bill pays for classes and they give book stipend. still paying way less then anyone else going to school who wasn’t in The service. And some states like Texas offer yellow ribbon programs to people who served and allow them free school.

Actually there is probably a lot of people that if they said it was banned would prob just shut down there nodes or stop using it just for the fact they think they would get caught. You doubt people’s ability to want to feel protected..

If government regulates it or is attempting to. It is up to the people weather we follow the guidelines they are setting or not. But as far as the US. We live in a democracy. And I didn’t vote for regulations on crypto. Pretty sure no one did except the people who are at the top of the food chain. The average Americans outnumber them billions to 1.  All we have to do is just not abide by the rules they are trying to implement. If everyone chose not to use the USD and use a crypto as payment the governments will have to be forced to adapt. But to many people in this world are sheep. And are afraid of the people that they elected into office tod begin with.

Okay so I can just assume everyone who owned bitcoin is dead and I’m the only one left. Boom BTC 10 mil. 
Like you have to have an accurate count of who ones and who’s dead with BTC to accurately factor that in.

People have to know those people died tho... or people just assume it’s other people hodling!
