Both coinbase support and the one replied to yo here explained it to you again. 
Your missing the point once again. 
Lets look at this way. the merchant has your sign-up return bitcoin address. You then later requested money to be send to a new return btc addy. The merchant choose to use the one you originally signed up with. Its the merchants fault. 
Therefore it makes sense to be advised to take it with the merchant

Im gonna guess your talking about coinbase since i had the same issue. 
If you open a ticket you will get a genretic response about high volume and etc. then theyll close the ticket. 
To me it happened when price tanked to bitfinex and i tried to buy at $530s. In the end ended buying at $560s. :/

its so annoying to see comments like those, who propose an algo change because of asics. Short sighting comments like those really show us how little do they understand the importance of the security network we get. Can't gloat bitcoin's immutability and at the same time shun the miners.. it so ironic. 
want to improve the centralization. then support people/groups who are trying to improve the network relays. The things that will make mining bitcoin just as efficient as anywhere else outside china. If they can improve the relay network nodes, we should see a lot of other pools rise. Help the majority of %hashrate spread from the top 10 pools, to the top 100 pools. and perhaps top 1000 pools. 
think of it this way. is it better to have 10 exchanges or 1000 exchanges? Why is the majority %hashrate on few pools? 
Instead of supporting those who are trying to improve the relay notes, we should take the short cut and change POW algo? Declaring to the whole word that we dont care that you invested millions of dollars to secure out network (which gives us one of the golden feature, our immutable ledger) we will fork you off.. 
because im sure with this new POW algo, investors will run to invest in your network security..

Same here. Had almost perfect experience. So far for over 3 years. I cant say for other services but its a blessing to have an easy buy service. How ever centralized it is. Id rather play ball and get bitcoins on my own home comfort than go out there and meet people to do the transactions
The only issue is that when there is huge drops or spikes. You shouldn't expect to get the price you want at that moment. 
Oh price is $530 but during this 4 minute you were going through the process to buy and the price rose to $570. Welp we gonna remove/freeze the confirmation button. Go ahead open a ticket, well just say sowwy 1-2 days later. 
As long as you accept that, then coinbase is flawless other wise.

From top to bottom. In less then few months. A smart miner operator understand that their users will vote with their hash rate. Because at the end of the day, the miners have to make sure they are not aiding to some pool operator that does not take precaution to avoid hurting the Blockchain. They have to make sure because their investment in mining electricity will be worthless if all of the sudden they find them self in the wrong fork. 
Also as  history shows (from all to recent) you can see that miner dominance has been shifting around. 
You are comparing the current mining situation. I would believe as closer as Bitcoin services become more regulated and defined. The bigger mining pools might end up being in the "insured and licensed" countries. Countries that might not be as cheap as Chinese unregulated ones but safer to run. 
This could be a bad example but think of bank deposits. Would you deposit your earnings into uninsured but %5 cheaper or will you invest at the more expensive but "licensed and insured" one? 
Edit. Also to point out that those exchanges have 0-fees and thus it is assumed a lot of self trading bots fill in the daily volumes. 
As an other bad example. A high frequency trading bot can sell and buy to itself 1 btc over thousands of times. To outsiders that could be seen as 1000 btc volume for the exchange they might be starving with no gains. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:39:36
hmm.. On my opinion it is not a good  solution.
Anytime there is a threat, then we abandon the current methods and shift to an other? this would be the opposite what bitcoin offers. changing things by flip flopping would make it harder to trust the block chain. it's the set definite and unchanged rules that are making bitcoin stick out from the rest. 
What's next change the cap supply?

Good points. 
Probably not a popular view but... What if the miners scaled too fast. I always pounder that what if they grew to big because they want a bigger slice but just too soon for Bitcoin's I today? I know that I am suggesting we should have a weaker network but maybe to many miners jumped on Bitcoin too soon? 
I understand the importance of how raising the block size would create a even worse centralization as bigger miners will out the smaller miners. And that is bad. But what if it's not? What if we are putting Bitcoin to a top floor it was not suppose to be there just yet. I feel like we should open the gate and let the free market readjust itself instead of trying to come up with counter systems to create fake floor. Let the miners fight each other as they were intended. Increase the block size. Let them get more centralized by natural greed and if Bitcoin is worthy it , it would find a way to re correct itself. 
I fear that while we are trying to avoid the scenarios we can see heading towards we might be creating obstacles for future scenarios that we can't foresee at this moment. 
When cpu mining was overtaken by gpu mining , Bitcoin didn't change to correct for that. The free market did. It moved to newer tech to outbid each other. Now we are on the asic area...
What we do understand is that once the mining rewards is over. The network will have to survive on transactions fees. Seems like everyone understand that golden rule that will occur then. In today's time though, why must we fear the miners. 
Maybe the miners scaled to fast while the user base is still low for them to profit from the current tx fees. Maybe we should just allow them to drop and correct to where the free market believes it should belong.

@_date: 2015-12-28 03:59:26
A full node is a mining node...🙈
Edit : 


What? 🙈
You can name a miner's node a full node all you want. But a full node commonly known around here is a node that accepts and relays transaction and it's completely seperated from mining. Miners are not nodes. Like you plainly say you can mine on a pool with out needing a node. The pool operator needs a full node up, which is the exactly the same as my full node(whom I don't mine from ) to be able to accept and distribute the payout. 
Article brings some obvious points that everyone should know. But I can't take it seriously when there is miss informed information there.

Yes. I am curious to see once LN goes live how it will improve bitcoin experience. ( in an optimistic way)
But again. I feel like this and other options being introduced is an answer to the hostile of miners on their intimidation on how they will accept low txs fees.  ( focusing my point on mining not low node problem) 
I feel like we are being intimidated by miners of today. We knew they would become a problem since the upset of when gpus joined the mining race against the CPUs ( well from what I have read). But Miners of today seem to finally have increased this threat to our network. 
Miners were a genius implementation by satoshi as incentive to ensure network security. While they are a double agent per say to our network, since their priority is their income, they are also a very crucial element to the Blockchain security. Therefore they should be considered a serious nemesis to us. 
If Bitcoin drops to few cents and stays like that for months , then we can all agree that most of this miners will shut down and wait to enter again once profitable or a good signs that they will get their roi in their near future. The same miners that are now demanding how bitcoin should be steered into. 
I think we should open the gate, increase the block size and not increase the fees ( if it wasn't for the spam attach /dust , I would even suggest to decrease the fees) 
Let the miners starve and correct themselves back to the optimal size that they should have been on the first place. 
Then who ever wants the get a slice of the rewards would have to join the network with a more serious investment entry point. 
If Bitcoin is worth it , which as more and more time passes it is, than the free market will correct itself back up. And we would have much more tx per seconds, low fees and perhaps even stronger network. 
 
Let's assume what happens if we go bigger blocks tomorrow and lower fees ( assuming we found a better fix for spam/dust)
Unless millions of new users jump in the Bitcoin network and start sending coins, the tx volume will not jump over night so the bigger blocks won't get filled. 
The only problem is that bigger miners can fill blocks and force smaller miners to drop out. 
That's it. Isn't it? The only major concern. That the bigger miners will force smaller miners to close shop? The concern that Chinese miners might be going on their own Blockchain as the outside nodes can't keep up? 
Alt coins forking to different block size have shown us a good enough scenario that the Bitcoin block chain won't really behave irrationally. We can assume that the men pool will most likely not create any chaos. 
So basically the main worry are the miners. oh and those who would want the Blockchain to stay small so users can seek out alternative solutions from middle man services. But let's stick with miners. They are the reason we are not pushing for higher blocks. Since we fear they will become more centralized. Which we all agree that they will become more centralized anyways. 
Since we will have this problem anyways. Why not push for a bigger gate now and at least build back up from a better block chain? 
Edit: of course this is a thought piece and not a demand :)
I know a lot of things go into this but I wanted to rant about miners. The users should have the power. Miners will drop our network security like hot potato if they won't get their roi. So let's think about the users who do the transactions rather then worry to scare off the already oversized miners
Also I am not blaming the miner for being where they are today. It was an open market and they played the field and grew where they are today(big pools) . I am blaming them for trying to stall Bitcoin progress because they are realizing that their investment in mining equipment, which they invested by themselves out of their own accord will not be suffice to stay ahead any longer. So they are using hostile/masked arguments to stall bitcoin's block chain growth so they can get/continue to get their roi..

Good article. Easy to read. 
But I'm tired of reading about the comparison of the early nodes and today's nodes counts. 
We are comparing it to a time where few people knew about Bitcoin to a time of now where barely few more people know about Bitcoin.  Why don't we just step back a bit and let's not jump to conclusions. 
Those high nodes back then were out of empathy as those users wanted to see Bitcoin bloom. But few things happened. 
1- the network got bigger and some of those nodes closed due to electricity, longer Blockchain synchs and data usage. Edit: also mining changed. No more straight out of core wallet but moved to pools. So no need to have open wallet while mining at a pool. 
2- above points lead for a demand for lighter wallets which of course people had even less incentives to run a full wallet. Edit: fixed to clarify that people choose to use lighter wallet not that the lighter wallet "pushed" for less full wallet 
In my opinion. Bitcoin's Blockchain will not scale faster then the technology progression of data storage and data streaming. Together with the (my)logic that Bitcoin will blow up in price. I can't believe that a lot of new nodes will not come online from users who want to ensure their new wealth is secured. 
I just can't read the comparison of back then to today's nodes counts when bitcoin is still such early stages and we have yet to see its true user behaviors when they are in millions.

You got lucky playing the trading game with alts. I say lucky because it was just what it was. 
Do you think you can play this game once more and win? Answer would be %50-50. 
So there is your answer. 
I would suggest keep them as soon it will be possible that it would be much harder to risk it. 
Remember as Bitcoin advances, less of this coins will be risked to play the trading game with alts. Since more and more alts/fiats alternatives are popping, I would also suggest that you use fiat to buy alts and play the buy low sell high. Don't risk your bitcoins anymore
Again. Your better off buying bitcoins but if you feel the need to risk it then use fiat and keep your precious bitcoins 
Good luck

Not sure why these guys at whitepuma.net get so little attention 
The created the first tipping app approved by Facebook . It made headlines.

Either way. I loved dropping rain bombs on there. 
They recently created an Instagram tipping bot. They are working hard designing gadget that websites can easily use to receive tips or coin payments. 
Check them out. Have been busy last two months so I haven't crazy tipped anyone in facebook but there, but before that I must have used that all for few months problem free.

(okay: first of all i have minimal knowledge on the bitcoin foundation. i am not making statement , only speculations. keep that in mind when you read my tin-foil-hat theory))
oh i love coinbase. i wish them all the best. Well they are already deep in the roots of bitcoin foundation. All i read nowadays is coinbase this, coinbase that. maybe coinbase has a market team posting here on reddit...
what i am worried about is coinbase turning into a huge corporate and becoming one of the things we dread the most
once some company becomes big, they have responsibility to keep a positive margin gain. And probably become power hungry. They have their employees and shareholders to provide for. 
i'm worried that they might loose focus on the doing good for bitcoin future and start focusing on their own future. Making bitcoin's community a mean to use to grow their corporation bigger. 
they might trade the love and ambition for bitcoin vision and get lost in getting positive quarterly margins. they will start to worry about their shareholders more then doing good for bitcoin.
I am afraid that once they are too big, when the time will come where bitcoin foundation will need to do something that will hurt their income, they will start lobbing against bitcoin foundation.  
not that i see coinbase as evil now, but time has shown that most companies that turned into a big corporation have always turned sour.

So what changed? Why the split? 
Because it was inevitable
 
Last time i read. Gavin and whom ever tried to urge focus on some other issues were met with resistance and or silence. 
How can they work together now when history has shown that most of the core do not sign on focusing anything else aside their agenda.
The split and what i forsee will be many more are nothing shocking. 
I think as outsiders we win by having multiple groups with different agenda work in parallel. Where all the groups can finally work on their visions and not feel forced working on others or met with criticism in lacking efforts. 
The drama , which was also foreseeable is that core should have never been build up to such a high seat when everyone outside, looks at them for the final thought. 
That wasn't a problem until recently when their vision differed. when most users got weary of not getting answers of why there is nothing being done outside the current core devs road map (or an announcment aside from we'll focus on it after) that problem sticked out like a sore thumb. 
when there were a lot more then an negligible amount of users who were looking at them for answers they got a reality check that the current core devs were not willing to compromise their visions. 
Unfortunately over modding also helped fuel the situation and thus lead to an even greater split between users. 
I believe gavin points are right. There needs to be multi groups working around bitcoin focusing on their visions
I don't think these parties will be able to work together under one roof but i am hoping they can work with each other in parallel. 
I hope they all stick around and continue focusing on their visions. Because i dont think they would work just as hard if they were to be forced on working on some one else's. 
And the users will be able to decide which vision to adapt and which to ignore.

Bitcoin helps one of the biggest issue of online transactions. Double spend/ no reverse charge backs . We have  the closest thing to virtual cash here. It's cash , online. 
If you want to sell something on the streets. Your safest option is cash. Anything else like Credit , debit , PayPal , gift card, check , etc have a reverse transaction . You can never feel safer than accepting cash. Anything else can be reversed back by your buyer claiming fraud. Then you will have to spend the time going through legal process to get your money back from them.
Not that accepting the cash it will prevent you from not going through a legal case. But unlike most of other forms of payment ,  at list you will have the full amount of cash still in your possession. Bitcoin falls on the same category as cash transactions. 
Also you have to remember. The whole Bitcoin ordeal is the block chain technology. Online ledger- decentralize distribution. Bitcoin the coin , is just the monetary value that is being traded compared to the block chain technology advancements. Being a back bone system, it's potential is being more and more realized by new users as they get more familiarize with it. It will be used as a solution/improvement to a lot of daily life systems we use at the present. Not to mention the possibilities that are yet to be discovered. 
Block chain technologies are the revolution. The real deal we are gathered here . Bitcoin the coin, or more relevant to the topics here , it's price , is all the speculations talks in correlation to what all these block chain solutions will give to the coins value via demand! 
So please do your homework about Bitcoin and its block chain solution before you downplay it as just an other payment solution.

Right. 
The only reason we look at the miners is because technically we can see if they updated be being on the right fork. Thus assuming that hashrate is at the right fork it would also mean the miners individual wallet would have to be updated so they can get paid on the right fork. Hence each miner while using a pool wallet to mine , they also indeed have to use the same wallet version of the pool. 
Regular users or individual nodes are hard to track. I can say here i am on this fork but i could easily be lying. Hence my public claim is not trusstless. But if i was a miner. I would have to use a wallet version on the same chain to actually get paid for my hashing burned.  
Hence while full node do indeed only force the hard fork rules, it is only the miners who we can guess with a higher guess of being right because we can see where the pools are mining on. 
So while miners dont have the power , as individual users they do and they will most likely have the same chain version as the mining pools. So we initially use the miners and their pools as a reference to estimate if majority of nodes are on board.

What is it with current posts focusing on the Chinese exchange volumes. 
Staph. We understand it's artificial. 
If I were to give you a dollar and then take it right back. And do this a 1000 times. In the end when that dollar is still in my pocket. Would you say your a 1000 times richer now?. Or would you even say you have a dollar? 
In my opinion, most likely the exchanges do inhouse artificial trades to grow the volume. So outside users can be tricked into believing they should join that exchange. The more users they get the more profit they gain from withdrawals and other fees. It's all a business trick. 
Don't get tricked

You know. Im tired reading your bullshit. 
At first I thought you were a troll so i just dismissed it. But now i think you truly believe the wrong claims. 
If you've really been pain attention. Gavin has been asking the core devs for months, even years to collaborate and help improve it. He has been shut off
Only recently he told them if you wont work with me to move forward then i will have no choice to but to split. 
I even think him supporting XT was a extreme move to show the devs how easy it can be to create a threatening party. It was to teach them a lesson about how they really do not have any power when they are going against the stream. 
How many times did gavin and others asked the core devs to confirm that "they wont" be spending time thinking of alternate option to scaling. 
He has asked them multile time to show sign of them doing something about it . They ignored him. And the others as well. 
It was your beloved cored devs and their lack to show compliance with the most demanded feature that has forced the spin of all these other "altcoins" pop up. 
It has been the over censoring of the mods here that has forced a lot of people to be irrational and turned thus turning the community here either for "core or XT"
But yeah.. Keep blaming the wrong party.

now i dont care anymore and i just want to add my opinion to any topic. If what i say causes me to get banned then so be it. I think a lot of users have come to same conclusion recently and are slowly getting back to to being more active here and not fearing to get banned. kind of weird i had to worry about this though..
the drama is obvious here and the other ones. but especially more stronger here. I dont know if i can see this recovering fast. And i dont think banning and censoring will prevent the clashes anymore. I like what some one else proposed. Let this sub be like the other bigger subreddit out there. Where new tags are introduced so topics are already categorized and let the drama focus on their own topic.. like [announcement] [news] [conspiracy] [opinion] [softforks] [hardforks] [merchants] [services] [miner] [other]. thus any different tag topic discussed on an other tag topic would fairly deserve a delete. and any topic started without a tag should also be deleted instantly. 
so then we can use filters to filter out which subtopics we dont want to be spammed with...

Ive been quiet about speaking my mind here lately.(mostly because if you speak against core here it must mean your a troll and shilling for xt) But i cant take this bullshit anymore. 
Yes any website or social platform will most likely always require a central authority or a group that owns the account. So yeah we "get it". They own it, they can do what ever. 
But thats where that messages irritate people. It wasnt such a strong statement back then. Tey didnt go around saying "hey its our house, your welcome , but once we feel like it, we will get it our way or go somewhere else "  wasnt being advertised as a private place. Because of that. A lot of people, smart or trolls, spend a lot of time here, posting and sharing their thoughts and ideas. Time and effort invested that slowly and gradually made what it is now. 
Because they felt this was a neutral place, a lot of services and people directed  new users with questions to bitcoin.org and in this sub.
And now, the message is " hey thanks for making us the center of interest everyone, but now we are taking over.  We got this lead, and if you don't like it, too bad!" 
Damn shame

When a fork occurs it uses the same difficulty. For a chain to be dead it would either have to have no nodes to communicate or slowly die with the difficulty. 
So when all mines move to an other chain. The difficulty remains on the fork and who ever is mining on that fork will have to compensate for all that mining power. But mostly the fork is dead when there is neither nodes or miners on the fork chain. And pausable to assume every single node instant updated or miner was instantly aware and moved to the right fork. 
Therefore it takes some times for a fork chain to die because there is a gold chance that some people forgot to update their nodes and some miner missed the memo and is still mining. 
Edit : or some small miners intentionally mining to get these coins and sell it to a service that is still on the old fork and is accepting/trading old bitcoins for goods 
Best example would be a small exchange or service who is cloueless and miners would mine on old fork. Find blocks (harder and longer but with a greater chance since there is no competition) and use those coins to trade 
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:36:59
exactly. Anyone could do this right now. It is no secret. 
i think Coinbase and the other exchanges have figured it out. That the cost of loss to double spending is not worth checking at low level transactions.(value wise)
Your typically busy burger joint doesnt ask their cashiers to check every single dollar bill if its counterfeited. it isn't worth stalling the lines and causing frustration from slow lines. it would be illogical. They will lose more costumers and in turn much more profits than to sit there make sure $1 and $5 bills are not fake.  
imagine the time wasted to count every single dollar bill , just because there could be one or two fake ones.. it is illogical. 
Now a hundred dollar bill, it is a different story. they will pull out their marker and test to see if your $100 if fake or not. So i am sure, if he tried to pull it off at higher scale he would be get caught. 
But knows all this. don't you? : )

It's not ethical to ask that. 
Sometimes people who ask are probably part of the lucky few who earn their bitcoins by doing the tiniest thing. 
Maybe lucky quick mine from the begging. Maybe a tip they received a while a go. Maybe they sold other coins. Point being that perhaps they got a cheaper entry and think people got the same luck.

It's main point is that it is offering a user finding them selves sending coins with tx too low to be accepted in next or near blocks, by having them change the fees of the same tx instead of opening a newer tx and taking double the space in the blockchain. 
Question raised is mainly is it worth it for those few that fall to it now. 
Is this solution best answer? Requiring all the services having to update their code and by doing so would make it way more risky to continue accepting 0-config. 
Taking example an exchange. Say something as big as coinbase. I can only guess they would rather risk small tx to go through 0-config and be declared insta withdrawal rather then having thousands of panic costumers open ticket questioning why their coins are not going through. 
I dunno. I find this solution(rbf) backwards. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:29:02
Im simply bring up the fact that they have made it so easy for a lot of users. (Millions based on their stats) 
Their service is a very useful feature. I personally don't feel comfortable buying btc from people on the streets or other methods. Especially located in NYC. And i dont feel comfortable watching them treated this way for expressing their opinion. They didnt offer an ultimatum. At this point they offered an option. If there was a demand they would offer it. They shouldnt be punished this way. Especially when their service is a legitimate entry way. 
Trust me i am watching this very closely. So i won't be buying and be caught surprised with unrecognized coins. I understand your point. I do. But they are a business at first and they would be shooting them-self in their foot if they silently sell me "other" coins 
Anyways. Im not trying to advocate for any party. But to exclude one of the cleanest way to buy bitcoins right now from the most visited site it's shocking. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:07:01
great article, my only pet peeve of mines is that we shouldn't compare the node counts to the early bitcoin years. 
Of course the node counts are dropping as more lighter wallets make it feasible to use bitcoin without having to spend so much hd space and time to run your full node, but it don't like to see the current status being compared to early years of bitcoin. But the majority of drop of nodes was also due to miners moving from their own wallets to a shared pool's node.
Back then everyone who wanted to mine had to use their wallet to mine from their own home and thus each miner were part of the full node counts. this was before pools blew up. also regulars users had their nodes running due to blockchain being smaller in size. thus it was cheaper in space. i also thing it was the empathy effect which helped as well. it was the beginning and a lot of those nodes came up online form regular users as well to show their support. It would not cost you a lot of space time and these users well willing to eat up the energy consumption. ( these are my assumptions as i was not in the space at those early years)  
Other than that spot on. 
I foresee our newest issue here will be the centralization of nodes as users might move to have their "full" nodes on cloud services. While they might think running a full node on some one else server is beneficial, eventually this will cause a concern similar to pool nodes. 
In reality while moving to these "cheaper to run" cloud services, we might risk the effect of having very few big service run most of the nodes and thus putting the our network trust on them to always stay up and running and not to use their power to force malicious code being relayed.
I think it is good that people in the space now are focusing on this and trying to come up with ways to reduce the cost to run your own nodes. we will need as much help and resources on this as we are putting into the mining and payments services. 
It will be cheaper for a harming party to attack bitcoin network via node consensus than via mining. The main reason why i think this will be an oncoming issue in our space. 
Hopefully more and more resources are put to reduce the cost effect to run individual nodes and with the help of bitcoins price rise the individual nodes will be greater then the centralized nodes offered by the cloud services.

Truthfully i think it mostly because a lot of users are tired coming here and seeing the constant drama. Even unrelated topic soon turn into a circle jerk. A lot of older accounts have claimed to be banned from posting here which could also mean that active posters might not be able to share their thought anymore. . And lately it seems that the other subs are getting a lot more activity ( news wise and different opinion topics) 
the hot topic recently has been all about the block size. And i bet a lot of users here held off from commenting before due to uncertainty of what is allowed to talk about in this sub. 
I hope slowly everything will be back to normal here. Until then. Get used to a lot less people commenting compare to how it was before in this sub.

Which would correlate with the graph 
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:40:09
right. i think i was agreeing with this. 
what i mean was that miners moving from solomining to pool mining has to be excluded in those older node counts. hence why i don't like seeing those older node counts compared to todays node counts. 
There has been constant node drops but its is less of a drop if we exclude the miners who came off the moment they switch to a shared pool's node. using these static we should have a better idea of the cost/analysis
i think to better show a comparison bet ween then and now, we must use the node counts after the majority of miners closed their wallets and compare them with the current status. thats all. i am totally agreeing with most of it.
edit: at any case it is, my pet peeve is irrelevant as the nodes are indeed dropping and we should focus on the future.

Miners as workers are not nodes. 
The miner's wallet is a node. A miners chooses a node, aka a wallet ( or the mainchain code that majority of $$ supports) to build on top of it. 
When satoshi says cpu power, he was assuming a miner who mined straight out of the wallet or the node with their cpu. He didnt not forsee the pool mining aka a miner split from the node. 
The only true network voters are the wallets( the ones that are able to relay output and inputs). This node influence what type of blocks they will validate and hence dictate to miners which chain they should build on top of it if they want their burned energy rewarded with bitcoins. 
Gavin's points now are that , thanks to newer ability of tools and means in the network, there can be multiple alternate core wallets that can co exist with in the same network. Where fundamentally miners can buildup on top of them and users can spend on top of them alternatively without breaking the common and consensus.  
Can this happen? Dunno. But wouldn't it be sweet to let those who want to try, try and let the free market decide if they are worthy? 
By censoring them, could hurt as those feeling oppressed might just blindly go follow any with out being vetted

yes seriously. How can they know where, how, and when the coins were sold. . I been using coinbase since 2013. buying little by little. at least 30-50 percent is either lost to bad purchases or lost in hacked exchanges.. 
I will allow more time for them to explain the situation, but based on recent events, i am scared to use them now. (look at my post history, i've been their cheerleader) 
I think this is their way of washing off their ends and forwarding the problem to their costumers. Which is fine, its their company and they can choose to do what they want. However, they will hurt their costumers by simply playing the blind eye, forwarding these cheap , inaccurate reports to IRS and saying , go correct the record yourself, thanks for using us. 
Thank you Coinbase. You truly did make it easy and safe for me to buy bitcoin since 2013, but now i do not have that feeling. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:29:44
while BTC_forever always goes to extreme ends towards the regulated exchanges, I think he is more right this time. 
I been a long time Coinbase supporter and have always known what it means to buy via them so i never jumped to the typical FUD bandwagon. 
Reading this blog, i dont think i can sit there and support their decision. Yes, its great to see them stating they will fight this , but it seems they want to fight it to benefit their end and only their end. throwing their users under the buss. To me it seems they want to come to somewhat of agreement to just having to do an annually simple report of each of their users activity and send it out to IRS and wash their hands. Putting the time and effort on IRS and their users to correct the record. 
Again, while it is their company and they can do as they want, this is dishonest as it is clear they will most likely send out wrong information. And they are marketing this fight as an effort to fight for their users benefit.

He is basically saying, now that there  are tools and means to test same network while still keeping the fundamental consensus of the bitcoin blockchain, then it would be ideal to have multiple clients out there. So when one client fails, there are others moving forward. 
He even gave the example of ford and how ford uses different factories to assemble their automobile parts and how it helps them avoid stalling when there is a failure from one of few..

hm interesting. First of all, you do sometimes reply but never with actual context to people who criticize by correcting or shared different opinion. it looks more like you are advertising and not really  open to discussion even though the context of the OP is pretty much asking for opinion/criticism. e.i: every single time, the most top comment in each post you spam is about how your slides have way too much words in them. yet, continue on. 
Secondly, i initially replied from my mobile, and there was some server error and took me to resubmit page.. So i tried to resubmit. this actually made me double post. there was two identical post of mine. when i check back hours later i saw the double post and that other dude post. i am guessing he saw my double post and repeated one for the laughs. i deleted the other duplicate post of mine, so perhaps you can see it. 
tl:dr; not my alt. Either a reddit bug or i was being trolled.

as a beautiful example i heard before. 
think of a radio giveaway. a host wants to give $100 in prices. every half time in his radio show he does the contest. he soon found himself with a dilema. with google and other fast internet searching engines all his question were easy to solve and calls would come in with in minutes with the right answer. Now while the radio host didnt mind paying the winning price, he hopped he could have some time to promote materials. in other word he need the winners to come in bit later. he needed more time. So then he decided to ask users to solve soduki puzzles before they were able to answer the question. set up a site online and had soduku puzzles where callerd had to go solve the puzzle first before they could call and claim the prize. he had easy, medium and hard puzzles. Incase callers were coming in faster they would rise the puzzle dificulty to maintain some breaks between callers
Basically thats the gist of the finding the block and their difficulty. As  video said, its basic math, but the dynamic difficulty is what normalizes the time between each block is found. with bitcoin rule is 2016 blocks in two weeks. this should average out of 10 minutes a block.

well he did answer correctly. just did not explain how the OP buy's moved from instant buy into a regular purchase that takes few days to clear and add the bitcoins into the balance. 
if OP had bought (what i will assume is $1000 daily inta limit) he would have had his bitcoin instantly and the debit withdrawal would take the few days to clear. but he would have his coins already. 
if OP bought $1001 worth, then he would not get insta bitcoin and he will have to wait for the process to go through before he is credited the btcs. 
hence coinbase_rosey was not a wrong reply. he should have been a bit more clear to let the OP know that he fell into the second category and he should see a charge in his debit account in a few days. 
TO OP:
basically, coinbase will request fiat from your bank anytime between now to 7 business days. i would guess by thursday you will see it. So yes. make sure you have enough funds to cover that.

they take seconds to show up as spendable? here in US , when even withdrawing money on an atm, i take the cash instantly, but when i log into my bank. it is there as pending for 1-2 days. So banks are forwarding me the money instantly, but yet take 1-2 days before they update their "ledger" to remove the funds.  With credit card it takes even more 
edit: how about a check. can you deposit a check and instantly remove that same amount? not usually. you will have to wait for it to clear up, wouldn't it? This is where they want to use the block chain. When you deposit that check , verified by the blockchain, then those fiats will be much faster or possible instantly available to withdraw as they are validated by the block chain.  
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:58:41
Haha. Yeah. I will leave it as it is. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:57:59
Do you understand how Nasdaq claimed that they can now offer t-0 from the regular t-3 ? 
Read up on the Byzantine general problem.  Basically banks need time to have their private ledgers to "synch" with each other to move coins around. The remittence problem and all that. 
But now with the block chain ledger. They can all instantly share the same ledger. Which they(selective few) can share and synch it. And with the blockchain technology they are assured that the transactions are unique ans thus can act on it faster. For example if I send you money via online bank transfer. They won't show in your account until 2-3 days. This is because both my bank has to make sure they log and remove appropriate amount of cash to you bank and your bank has them to validate it them self as well and then allocate these money (well the ledger) from their general deposit to reflect the amount you own. This takes time and resources. The block chain just made it instantly. Be removing the possible human error(miscommunication, allocating of found that are not there , etc) 
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:23:29
Okay. That was a bad example because it mislead you in the wrong direction. 
You have to go back to the fundamentals. What is block chain? Well. They want to remove the miners. That's a nice and dandy. So who validates the blockchain? Now think about how many of them validate it. It will be small numbers. That's the main issue. You can't risk that. Because in Bitcoin you need a lot of resources to go back or even in  future to fake the data. With this small permission-less blockchain you risk having you data changed to easy. 
 Basically the block chain need node/network security and that only strengthens with more and more nodes out there. So it become an oxymoron thing to claim permission less block chain as you would have 1000 nodes to ask to adapt to the changes you want. A company itself could have 1000000 nodes and control them but then it becomes expensive to run it. So why bother. Just use data.

Also the banks can finally trust each's other ledger by practically sharing the block chain solution as a ledger. Banks keep their own ledger private and other banks won't just accept a check from them but have to go through middle man services to verify that indeed that bank has that amount. 
With block chain. They do no need to go through so many loops as they can trust that the block chain won't lie and the other banks can't "send" coins that they never had
Same as my wallet and you Wallet in Bitcoin. I can't send you 1000 btc a that I do t have thanks to the miners and regular nodes that validate the history of each bitcoins ownership. 
How can I trick this in Bitcoin ? Well you know the answer to it. With over %70-80 of hashrate/nodes. Imagine how much I need to spend to beat this. Now imagine a tiny group with much lower network (extremely low miners and regular nodes validating it). Hence why people scream security. Because the Bitcoin remove the trust of other parties claiming valid coins. While in this bank scenario. It would be effortless for one bank to decide to change the history of transactions. Making it to be depended on each other's trust. Also if someone can break into their network they can easily and way cheaper to change the history transaction. 
Basically some one with a botnet farm  could hack into them and change the transaction history and destroy/ make it seems the coins should be all on his account, etc.

You'd think by now they would know better then to rush to an exchange first. 
I wonder if these exchanges will cooperate and freeze accounts. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 23:00:02
Well i mean i didnt move coins around due to fear of being stuck. So i dont speak for anyone else out there but i sure as hell didnt create any additional work load. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 23:26:55
I dont think the address change triggered it. I too was a long costumers and my limits dropped few weeks back. 
Now the shitck is that it will raise once i buy back enough and build up my history. Which is bullshit. Because now they also raised their percentage. So its pure money grap. Obfuscated with reason that they changed services. Yup, uh huh.

He means that banks control the code and thus can change it any time they do so. So if you have 1000 btc equivalent in their "wallet" under your own private account. You can find that tomorrow they print brand new coins. Say 1 billion more. And all of the sudden your "wealth" has lost value due to inflammation. And that's just the total cap.  They can freeze your coins as you won't control the private keys. Etc. 
Basically their block chain will help them have a faster transaction between each other (other banks ) but still has all the centralized problems we have with fiat. 
Think of it this way? 
Edit: using the block chain technology try can solve the Byzantine general dilemma, short the time between transaction confirmation etc. but they chose the rules of how it is done and can change them anytime they want. While with permit ion of Bitcoin block chain. You need a major consensus to change the code. Thus creating a stronger decentralized blockchain.

Not to turn this into a big block small block circle all over again. But I agree with you. 
I guess i tried to make my point that i chose to not use bitcoin network due to fear of uncertainty. So yes bitcoin tx are down now but thats because i choose to not make any txs. Is bitcoin chumming smooth ? Nope. I was forced to (my choosig) not transact yesterday due to high mem pool. 
So perhaps bitcoin is not fine and users like me choose to just not pay the price for the spot and sat it out.

Hey. You double tipped me. Cool. I will forward it to the next r/millionairemakers
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:29:56
Right. Only that i didn't choose. I didn't trust who was holding my coins to place in the right enough fee and not fuck it up and cause stalling. So yeah.. I get what your trying to say. But that doesnt work when most wallets are not equipt for countering a high demand or spam. 
Maybe in future we wont have this problem of sending or not sending in fear if enough fee was paid. But yesterday , Bitcoin was broken to my standard   
Edit: by broken i mean the current services handling it. Not bitcoin itself.  I love bitcoin :)

Weird way to compare it

Things like this help much more then price spikes. Awesome! 
I can't wait to spend bitcoins knowing i can refill it as easy as depositing a check! 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:20:48
right, cause i been saying all a long that banks system is so outdated....
anyways i showed you plenty of opportunities that banks can gain by using the block chain technology. I have also shown a few reasons why it would be more secure for them to use bitcoin's as it is much much more safer and already disrupting the space. 
So lets agree to disagree and move on. I am not sure what your trying to prove anymore. you started with questions and now your mocking the answers. 
I am not calling the bank's system old/slow/bad. Clearly they see how their systems can improve by using the block chain technology or else they wouldn't bother. But they can adapt a stronger more secure blockchain or use their own and learn the hard way and then move over to bitcoin's or what ever is the strongest chain by then : )

You know what grinds my gears. The network fee. I mean I understand it why we have it. But I don't see how it can be so high. Here we have a digital crypto currency where it can be broken down to 1/10000000th but we are limited to a minimum fee. I know it was a fast and easy solution to counter attack spam and dust... But I wish we could find a better solution than sacrificing this min limit....

This is gentlemen!  
@_date: 2016-05-13 18:50:42
Further more. Does this means the senders and receiver wont know if the transaction occurred until the six blocks as well? 
Until we know more info i find this sketchy and also an attempt to push to use other solutions...

First of all I am not promoting them. Just sharing my opinion. Please do your own research(who is reading this)
There are a lot of altcoins in there which are not featured anywhere else. Therefore I understand why users stick around. They also have not had a serious hack. It's older so people trust them
About btc withdrawals. Some one mentioned that there is a high probability that after a while ( possibly the 6months period of inactive) cryptsy moves your coins on their cold wallet. Which I could understand why it might freak people out why they can't withdraw instantly. Not reasoning why it fine to take weeks. Or even a week. 
Speaking about taking a long time, a lot of hustle and a lot of open tickets until users get their withdrawals. I could see few factors: maybe they don't have all their users coins and working on frictional reserve , Not enough employees to handle the support tickets etc. 
Probably a combination of both. Not enough volume to hire more support. And judging by the recent complains, probably pushing the withdrawal time as much as possible to maintain their frictional reserve? Or could it be bad management between the different level supports. I dunno. 
Conclusion is that eventually people must get their coins back or enough do to not cause panic. I'm not a day trader. Solely because I can't handle the frustration of whether my coins will clear out or not. But as a altcoin holder in my past I loved knowing that cryptsy was there to support them. I wish they could find the mojo and provide a better service. Because more exchanges the better for the market.

Great podcast!!
 
Ps: you should join Coin Dojo with an anonymous account ;)

But you would feel the effect eventually when those burned bits never add to sell pressure...

Perhaps they are concerns that allowing their users to act as mule for these coins might jeopardize their status.

Hmm. That's not who this works. That's not how any of this works!
If all of the sudden everyone stops buying for a whole day , and I buy 0.00000001  of bitcoin for $1 at 100'000'000usd/btc rate. Coin market cap will take the last price x the total amount available = new cap. 
If you need to see it in real time. Check 20-30 listing bellow of other coins with little to nothing 24 hrs volume. Then go buy $1 worth of it and watch their net worth spike to multimillions :)
