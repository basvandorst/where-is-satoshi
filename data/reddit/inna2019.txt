Bitcoin cant reach even 11750.

If we look at history like dot com bubble, south sea bubble or tulipmania bubble we can predict crash to 3500$.

Ok, we all will be a millionare! This is real, right?

Bulltrap. Skip.

I have exactly 0.1 BTC in investment.

**Its just another big sell wall from nowhere.** This will push up the price for about 500$.

Imagine a life so sad you have to post a comment like this... Get a life...
@_date: 2018-03-04 10:35:02
I agree.
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:24:04
Impossible. Lot of buyers who bought above 13-14k lost faith in bitcoin. We need more people to push up the price.

What do you think what is next?
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:30:49
If bitcoin dont stabilize, then will be impossible to pay bills.

I agree. Its not the time to invest. DIP is coming this week. Maybe 5k?
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:45:02
What do you think what is next from this picture? Solution 1 or solution 2? What happened before in history?
I really want to invest but if the price is not right the price is not right. I can afford to lost 500 euro, but if i dont need to lost i dont want to.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:35:07
I agree.

I agree with you. This seems like market manipulation. Before 2 weeks only bad news, tether ban, experts said price will crash to 2000 or less. Now, only good news, the same experts are telling to us the price will reack 20000 or 50000, big sell walls from nowhere... I dont know will price reach 12000 or 25000 or 5000, but at this time i will skip to buy more bitcoin (i have 500 euro in wallent). I will wait another dip. Smart people told: do not buy at hype.
