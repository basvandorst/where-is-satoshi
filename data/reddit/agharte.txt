Sure. Just FYI, I'm a 90% long-term investor and a 10% trader. So my portfolio may not be the best representation just like Pantera and many other crypto funds' portfolio being down -40% is not a good representation of their overall long-term goals.

CBOE was a non-player anyway. CME is where the real volume and action happened. You can verify volume for the past year from Committment of Traders reports (COT data).

Technically there's no legislation that stops Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies to be invested in through institutions, banks, pension funds, 401ks etc. Fidelity is trying to educate the newer, potential investors and provide them a custody service + portfolio assistance as they embark on their journey of investing into crypto.

Fidelity is creating an on-ramp for larger plays to come get their feet wet in the crypto market. Mind you, Abigail Johnson, Fidelity CEO, has been a big fan of Bitcoin and crypto in general since 2014. It takes time for infrastructure and an entire industry to grow and evolve. But kudos to Fidelity for leading the pack and making this happen. The next 5 years will be revolutionary for this space, imo.

Then I don't think you understand how markets function or how bubbles get formed. Read Ray Dalio's book about Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises. It literally mentions how new asset classes and hype cycles form, create bubbles and eventually burst. Tulips, silver, gold, the advent of television and other new technologies, the internet bubble, and bitcoin/crypto are the same. Also read about Gartner hype cycles.  
I do, however, agree that short-term price action is hard to predict but bubbles form in a pattern and burst similarly, too.

It's already visible- big mining farms have opened in Texas and Iceland. Why? Because energy costs are, on average, lower there than other places. Market forces will inevitably prevail in such landscapes and the miners and firms will flock to cheaper energy sources or even alternative energies.

Not sure about 3-4, I'd more so agree with that 1% of the 2000 crypto's being potential legitimate use-cases for the future. That brings us to about 20.

I may disagree with Warren Buffet on his Bitcoin assessment but you definitely win the village idiot award for such a ridiculous comment.

People over complicate markets when they start injecting emotional bias and "fundamental reasoning" when the price for speculative assets is often moved solely on technicals and very little of the fundamentals. The trend is still intact and we are just looking for a good price where technicals are over extended to the downside (just like they were over extended to the upside - 20k) and the fundamentals keep growing and evolving but price keeps going down. This is where the divergence happens and the trend shifts. I have no idea when price will be over extended to the downside and I'm not in the business of predicting. But having traded the equity markets for 11 years, one thing I know is the maximum amount of people need to feel the pain to cause capitulation at a price that seems unfathomably low then we can start creating the bottom.

I disagree with your disagreement. The only cost to mine that matters is the one that is the lowest cost of energy to mine.

Well first of all it's less than 2 months. And through the entire bear market Bitcoin has at least showed strength to get back to the 618 fib level on the reverse fib retracement. The fact that this time it did not even retrace to the 318 fib level and it's already looking like it wants to come back to the prev. low of 3100, is a bad sign. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:08:28
You don't create bottoms for the price to come back to it and be tested so quickly.

Which one is safer? That's one of my biggest concerns regarding these crypto trading platforms. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:30:34
100% agree. I also question the quality of volume reported from exchanges. Coinbase, imo, is far more reputable than other exchanges but still a far cry from equity markets having legitimate numbers w/out inflated stats.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:20:32
Did not know about GDAX having such low fees. I'm a novice crypto trader so Coinbase seemed simple, convenient, and your order is guaranteed to fill.
Was the transition from coinbase to gdax easy?
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:13:51
There's some strong support at 4900/4800. Statistically your odds are better to wait and buy then or you wait above 5300 for price to show strength. Buying now is essentially buying in no-mans-land.

This is a garbage post. At least make some effort to lie.
I'd believe this much more if you photoshopped Noruiel Roubini (an economist and harsh bitcoin/crypto critic) and showed him buying crypto :)

Here's something fun:
The final Mercury Retrograde of 2018 is coming up from November 17th through December 6th.
I'm no hocus pocus believer but I've seen substantial evidence from traders around the world swear by it. I have never trade off it but I do like to keep an eye on it. Let's go through it: You will see the retrogrades color coded, the left vertical denotes the start of the cycle, the circular shape denotes the slowing down of the planet (middle of the cycle), and the next vertical is the end of the retrograde.
Thus far my analysis of the retrogrades since last year is this: At the beginning of the retrograde - whether the cycle is bullish (2017) or bearish (2018) - the cycle continues with the first vertical. The middle circular shape puts a stop to the continuation and slows it down for the upcoming reversal. The second vertical of the retrograde cycle starts the reversal with a subsequent push for several days/weeks beyond. If we were to follow this patterned logic here's my prediction as per the cycle:
Nov 17 - Nov 25 (Market keeps falling toward $5000/$4800)
Nov 26 - Nov 30 (Market finds bottom and floats sideways)
Dec 1 - Dec 6 (Market reverses and heads toward $6000)
Dec 7 - Beyond (Slingshot and rejection near mid $6000 level)
The above projection is shown by the ghost bar patter, white bars.

BTC Inverse H&amp;S being created - we may have a temp. bottom here. Long opportunity for a 2.5% gain possible as listed. If price gets above green line you can add to your long and take it toward the red supply block. Stop should be 1-2% below RS wick low.

This is something I've documented well in my video analysis today and my futures manipulation video on Cryptosomniac channel.   
The markup of 2017 was most definitely due to the fact that BTC futures were approved. From then all they had to do was short the market. And now that their respective firms may be interested in buying BTC or cryptos, even better, manipulate and suppress the price, gain yield on short positions and accumulate as prices dip lower and lower. Win-win for smart money.

Thanks for the story! Investing in decentralizing money is betting that the traditional finance system will fail; a wise bet, I'd say. The erosion is slowly happening around the world e.g Venezuela, Zim, South Africa, Italy, France, Euro etc.. It takes time to destroy a system with so many greedy and power hungry actors. This could be a multi-decade process but it will ultimately happen. Out of this will come a fully sovereign style of money.
