Agreed, totally forgot to change the icon to hotdog format - I originally had a slide menu there. This was an evening fiddle that got a bit out of control!

Sorry, I should have made clear that this is just my personal take on what I'd like to see. I did not intend for this to represent anything official!

Give me a day or two and I'll let you know, waiting for the transaction to show up on my statement. I'll echo the OP though, it is VERY easy to use, after Bittylicious (which I like) this just feels like a real step up.

Thanks, I think a huge problem with current bitcoin apps/software is usability for the layman. I think the the current of gen of bitcoin apps has a long way before they make themselves usable for the average joe.

Merely a suggestion for the blockchain team

I feel like this attitude is hugely detrimental to Bitcoin in the long term. I use Coinbase regularly. I know the risks and shady behaviour and blah, blah, blah. But you know what - I couldn't give a fuck. It's convenient. Easy to use. Has a UX that doesn't make me want to put my head in an oven. I don't wanna know what's happening in bitcoin 99% of time - fuck I look checking on my bank 24/7, I have a life man. If this community can't grasp the need and value of well designed, easy to use products for the mass market then bitcoin will never gain critical acceptance.
