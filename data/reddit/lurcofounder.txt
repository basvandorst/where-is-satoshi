Your hypothesizing about something that won't happen for another 120 yrs. Efficiency in chip design, electricity generation, etc. will most likely render any current theories moot. It's probable that by that date, mining will be so efficient and decentralized that it's no longer a big business, but rather, everyone would mine using their coffee makers, toasters and whatever sort of communication devices we're using in the future.

At this point, I'm convinced it would amount to a 'regulatory taking'. Lots of litigation arguing about whether govt can substantially decrease the value of your property through regulatory action without proper compensation. 
Also, won't happen. But, if the US govt wanted to do that now, I would suggest they look back to when they legitimized the use and ownership of Bitcoin by auctioning off the Silk Road coins. That action pretty much foreclosed any ban, regulatory or otherwise.

This is spot on. By controlling the release of BCH, they did not allow a free and orderly market. On top of that, by giving no notice of market open, traders couldn't participate in the market because they didn't know about it. It was a manipulated, not a free, market and it was clearly being run to prevent a flash crash of BCH. They've shown a history of favoring certain markets over others (see ETH flash crash with rolled back trades). The whole thing is shady and the opposite of what a free market should be. Exchanges MUST be impartial and free of conflict or they can't be trusted.

Yeah, that's not true. US residents can purchase, hold and use Bitcoin legally.
Edit: and accredited investors can buy into bitcoin investment trust. The ETF will enable non accredited, or regular retail investors, to invest in BTC through 401k or regular brokerage accounts.

The ETF will be bad for the bear whales, which means greater liquidity and less blatant manipulation. Price should have much less volatility and more organic growth rather than these ridiculous pump and dump cycles the whales run. That's why I think an ETF will be approved. It's the governments only tool to engage in psuedo regulation of the glibal BTC market. Also, China beat US to the mining game, so US has to be first mover in another aspect - derivative markets tied to BTC.

There's no specific guidance on this, but personally, I think this would be a swap, or a 1031 like-kind exchange and the taxes would be deferred until you exchanged into USD. So theres no real need to dump coins to get USD.

Bitcoin is a commodity. What gives the commodity its base value is the security provided for by the world's most powerful distributed computing network. Other use cases provide additional value, such as a medium of exchange and a store of value, among others. That value is expressed in the exchange rate found at various exchanges and in various trading pairs, from EUR and USD to ETH and LTC. The current value as expressed in those pairs is whatever someone is willing to pay for it/sell it.

At that point, miners will be given the new software client and are 'allowed' to mine the new chain. It basically allows Bitmain to premine the new chain for I believe 72 hours. Thus every block on the chain rewards Bitmain and Bitmain alone. In theory, they could alter the chain in whatever way they wanted b/c there's no one to watch what's happening. It's a really, really stupid idea and is either an insane move on Bitmain's part, a blatant power play to control the network going forward, a bluff to scare the community into supporting their demands, or a clever misdirection aimed at some other end game I'm not seeing yet. 
But no matter what way you slice it, this is unprofessional and irresponsible behavior from Bitmain designed to benefit a minority interest in the system. It's against the whole idea behind Bitcoin.

Imho, Bitcoin (and some other cryptos) derives a great deal of it's value through decentralization. I don't want a JP Morgan coin or a Goldman coin. I want a globally distrubted ledger that no single government or financial system can alter. Bitcoin has that. Fed coin, Goldman coin or Ether just don't have that and they can be (and will be) changed to meet the needs of a minority interest. The value comes from (1) scarcity, (2) security, (3) immutability and (4) decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:33:29
How does that not lead to centralization in the current environment? Decentralization is a core part of Bitcoin. If you take that away in the name of only the strongest survive, the idea dies. Hence the brilliance of the USAF and allowing economic majority to dictate terms to the security providing minority. Don't like it, mine some other coin and let the network adjust accordingly to lack of new hashpower.

I might not be understanding this 100%, but if I am I think a huge issue is that the efficiency boost is present in all the miners Bitmain sells, it just can't be activated. So Bitmain is selling these less efficient miners onto the market when only they have the ability to use the same machine themselves in a more efficient manner. Besides the danger to the network, it is an exceptionally shitty business practice. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:38:47

This is fantastic advice. A+
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:00:17
I think the best way to describe it is BIP 148 is a way for the economic majority (the users - nodes, exchanges, wallets, people) to enforce a rule change on the miners. If there's enough support among the economic majority, the miners have no choice but to support the upgrade, otherwise they're mining a worthless coin, irregardless of their hashpower. It's a drastic step that was built into the design of the system. It's purpose, as I've always understood it, was to netralize the power of the minority who secure the network. The downside is a contentious fork with a real possibility of a chain split.
Whether or not you think this situation warrants such a drastic step is up for debate. I personally think it's necessary. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:35:56

There was a time when using BigBank made sense. You'd deposit with them for 48 months and get 10% APR. Now not so much. If people have an actual alternative, BigBank might be so big anymore.

You also seem to be taking a very local view of the issue. It's true, Joe six-pack or Suzy soccer mom in the US suburbs might pick BigBank over Bitcoin.

Then there's the Nigerian farmer who never felt safe depositing his wealth with the crooks running that currupt system? Or the Chinese dissident who's trying to defect to a better life in the West and whose only hope of talking assets across borders is Bitcoin. The use cases are endless and encompass so much more than 1st world use cases that would be utilized by BigBank coin.

The like-kind exchange could be tricky but that's my strategy unless the IRS says no. For cashing into Fiat, I understand the concern and I've thought about it to. I figured my cost basis will be so low, the taxes I would save by claiming the basis wouldn't even be worth my time to figure it. So I just plan to claim 0.
