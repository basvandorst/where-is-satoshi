I hope Lawnmower's soon compatible with the Internet Archive Credit Union, would love to try this!

Yup, regulation sucks. I know the people working at the Archive and its credit union are still fans and users of bitcoin :)

Hopefully from Hal's perspective he's simply going to wake up, with little notion of the amount of time that passed, in a healthy body and with a new lease on life. I'm looking forward to seeing that day and his first reaction to crypto's influence in the world by then.

Couldn't agree more with the last sentence in his interview.
"Sovereigns want to be able to control their destiny, and that means controlling their own currency."
Precisely why I use bitcoin :)

"Hello friends! I'm working on a school project for university on the use of bitcoin in Argentina and I need all of your help! It will take only 5 minutes or less with some short questions. Thank you very much for your collaboration and I hope you enjoy the questions. You can leave a comment below or send me a message if you have any doubts as to whether I'll publish the results when the project is finished (in English). Good day to all the bitcoiners  "
The first question asks whether or not you're in Argentina.

Fantastic rebuttal, so insightful. Please elaborate!

Silly me, I've known about this place accepting bitcoin for over a year now, but thought they only sold tech books (of which I don't need any). When I wanted to eat out with bitcoin I'd drive to Portland, and this place was just a couple of blocks away from me the whole time!
Anyone know of any other places that serve food and accept bitcoin in Seattle?

I was just there today as well! First time paying with bitcoin in a restaurant. Seemed like they weren't using any payment service but it worked well enough. The bill was in fiat and didn't have the exchange rate noted, so I just used the average as reported by the android bitcoin app. They did ask me to leave my name and phone number on the bill.
Wish more restaurants around me would accept btc!

I've made many successful purchases from them. Plus, they're publicly traded on BitFunder.

There's a smaller, easier to scan QR code in the upper right corner of that sheet :)

You can open an account with them from anywhere in the US. They'll just charge you a $10 donation to a local NJ charity to fulfill their "local" requirement.
I've opened one and been very happy with the service thus far.

I'm out of state but was able to open an account. They require you make a one-time small donation to a local charity in their area to fulfill the "local" requirement.

Thanks google:

Sweet! I'll definitely be patronizing this business for my next move

I opened an account over the weekend and let them know in the application's comment field that I'd be looking forward to any bitcoin integration. Hope to be able to move all my banking over to IAFCU and stop taking part in the criminal bankers' system.
