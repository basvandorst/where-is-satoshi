the big thing is there is often a 3-5 day lag. due to time it takes to get money/btc into and out of the trade houses when big things happen.  so its so hard to pinpoint when and where the needle will move.

no reason you cant setup a dozen wallets, and bounce coins in and out if them,  would make tracing all the parts of a lump sum harder to prove they were yours.  if they cant access all your wallets.

when they can be divided up into 8 decimal places,  they can.  especially if they wind up being 1 bit-cent = $1, lots of room to grow, assuming the value is believed.

one has to be really bad at at investing to loose everything.  i bought low, sold some off to recover my expenses, as it got higher, and now i have no debt, and a ok sized wallet,  day traded some additional coins to have cash to buy up cheap coins during these corrections/lows. 
Im involved for various reasons, I want to see it succeed, I want it to grow, and be of use, and its been a great experiment in micro economics, and all the associated speculation and market.  I don't mind that if i make a little money in having faith in the system before the unwashed masses found it.

Perhaps they were not smart at investing.  I bought in cashed out enough to payback my investment(plus a little profit).  Even bought back most of my sales when the marked dipped with just the profit, and now i have a small pile of coins that may some day be worth something.. but if not *shrug* i don't care!

my preferred method, would be to do it directly (one on one) buy/sell which we could do here.   if you have coins you want to sell or you want to buy them, there is nothing to stop you from using paypal, or cash or money order, or even credit card payments to each other assuming you have the way to verify/run the transaction. 
That being said, ive pretty much only used BCM and MTGOX.  but hopefully soon people may use our hackerspace as a trading space.

the bigger question is is it just a brokerage for people to paypal/dwalla/escrow moneys form one person in exchange for bitcoins? at that point theres risk for fraud, unless the coins are escrowed somewhere (and that's dangerous Ala deepbit, mgtox....) or a actual market?  if so where is it hosted, and how does one get cash in and out?  i for one wont trust a market hosted in the US because I think they are too likely to get THE BIG KNOCK!)

perhaps browser based hashing?

Hell forget the 14year old, they will probably on average be more tech savvy than any generation before.  its the 65yearolds that need the extra coddling. and they have most of the best reasons to get into a untaxible market.

buy low.. sell high.  I just wish i had more cash in the market when it took the dip.  by the time my dwolla funds get there it will likely be too late..  *oh well*,  ive already made back my initial investment by selling off a small portion of my coins when the market was high.  as for why?  probably people skittish about the news articles.

I'm old enough to remember when ATM's were new,  My mom having to learn to use one, it involved some hand-holding by the bank.  
I don't disagree the ui/wallet/terminology will need some evolution,  but all in all its only been on most non geek's radar for a grand total of 2 months.

I suspect those of us who believe in the system, will continue to hash even when there is no money to be made out of it,  it may dwindle, but the system wont collapse unless everybody quits.
