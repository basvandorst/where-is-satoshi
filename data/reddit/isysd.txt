From what I hear from Venezuelans who've fled to Panama and elsewhere, that is quite possible. You have to remember how desperate these people are for dollars. $20 equals 100x the local currency in 6 months as today.

The Decentralized FLOSS Guild is a proposed organization of free and open source content creators. Eventually, the guild will issue its own Bitcoin sidechain, run a payment network, arbitrate transaction disputes, and enforce contracts. That is all very grandiose and abstract, and those interested can [read more]( More importantly, right now, the guild needs a face.
De FLOSS founders were thinking that an appropriate and engaging logo would be Tux riding a honey badger and pointing the way. First, lets meet our mascots.
[This is Tux, the Linux mascot.](
[Here is Tux being a gentlemen, for the annual GNU Ball.](
[Finally, we see Tux showing his true colors.](
[This is the honey badger.](
[Honey badger is famous for not caring about your petty problems.](
[Honey badger is the official mascot of Bitcoin.](
The proposed Guildcoin is planned to be a sidechain using Bitcoin as a reserve currency. De FLOSS Guild's currency will be backed by Bitcoin, but the guild will provide material support and engage the broader FLOSS community.
The rules of this contest are as such:
1. All submissions are to be posted in [the forum.bitcoin.com thread]( and given a creative commons license. De FLOSS Guild will purchase the winning design for 0.5 BTC, and will maintain its CC license.
2. All submissions are due within 24 hours from the time of the forum posting. (by Wed Dec 16, 2015 9:15 am UTC-5)
3. The final decision will be made via vote by Guild members. Votes of non-guild members will be considered but not counted in the final decision.
This post will be updated to reflect contest updates. If there are questions or general discussion, we'll respond in the thread. Thanks, and good luck!

I think the problem would be in enforcement of a reversal. Sure, you could all realize your mistake and make a collective decision to redistribute winnings... but with bitcoin you couldn't effectively force any of the false winners to return the funds. You wouldn't even know how to get in contact with them to let them know about the situation. You can keep the funds in escrow for longer and longer periods to allow Decisions to age, but at some point, people want to access their funds, and then the decision is final.

haha, I'll stop responding to this thread, as I just answered you above. :)

This check is meaningful for public policy and years-long cycles, but not for financial decisions. Financial fact checking is much harder, often requiring thousands of man hours with privileged data.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:04:44
The problem with decentralizing the bet settlement is people are often wrong, even if they are honest. The reward to correct deciders is a step in the right direction to aligning incentives between deciders and betters, but there is still the problem of decider ignorance. Case in point, lets say you are betting on the outcome of a presidential electoin:
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:15:10
That's fine, but for that reason people don't write financial contracts referring to the google finance closing price. To the extent they have written contracts referencing other prices, those prices *have* been manipulated for profit.
There are surely other uses of truthcoin, but I think many people are interested in these financial use cases. IMO truthcoin has no advantage in financial markets, and even some new problems.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:04:49
OK, but people are often ignorant about questions with supposedly unambiguous answers, as well. Particularly in the examples you give that relate to financial markets and pegs, there are many ways these figures are manipulated. Maybe it is difficult enough for the massive USD market that the truth will be discovered quickly, but how many assets/contracts can say that? Gold? Bitcoin? I don't have much faith in the statisticts reported for either. For many assets, it is pretty easy for the people doing the reporting to sway public opinion for days or even weeks.
An unambiguous expected answer does not guarantee accurate responses from a general poll, nor the authenticity of the underlying reports that the deciders will read. If they all read the same newspaper to determine their answer, you might as well just refer to the newspaper and not pretend people fact check articles.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:04:12
My belief is that if truthcoin is used in the manner indicated in your blog post about bitusd, someone is going to take advantage. It is an open invitation to the publishers of market data.
Head over to on any random day, and you're likely to find accusations of market manipulation by one party or another. A truthcoin-usd would be an obvious target. Even if this only accounts for a single percent difference, that is still not tolerable for a financial product.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:59:44
That works ok for a website gateway to a decentralized network, but you're doing the opposite. Traditional finance is inherently centralized, and will re-centralize this market in predictable ways.
While it is fully possible people will create their own markets and market data feeds, it is not practical to expect it. More likely is that they will do the easy thing and continue to trust and defer. I don't argue that Truthcoin isn't innovative or useful, but that the ways it is proposed to be used are impractical.
^^ I agree 100% with the criticism of bitusd, but suggesting that Truthcoin could provide a viable alternative is equally disengenuous as bitshares. There is ample evidence of market sentiment and data manipulation in every stock and commodity market in the world.
By providing a set of rules by which you will pay people based on their manipulations, you are inviting the LIBOR types to have a free go at your market. "Here's how you fool us." By decentralizing, you have in fact given them more indirect power over the contracts. They could even place anonymous bets to monetize their manipulation more effectively.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:12:14
This is just a famous example. Look at the LIBOR scandle. The world is full of misinformation and ignorance. I don't think turning over decision making to a self-selected group of strangers is going to be a very good choice for many types of bets. Add in the difficulty of reversing/arbitrating mistakes, and I wonder how viable such a market could be.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:24:58
When Intrade made a bad call, I'll bet it was arbitrated and they ended up compensating people. There is no mechanism for correcting such mistakes in a decentralized system.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:08:15
Thanks for sharing the link, it was very informative. I like the 2 month cooldown period for decisions, but am not convinced it is sufficient for all use cases.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:27:08
I agree with you to the extent that people are betting on on-blockchain activity. If you are betting on the price of an on-blockchain exchange, for instance, then no one should have any doubt.
Most financial markets don't function in transparent ways, however. As someone who lost money in the MtGox/Willy debacle, I would not feel better knowing that Willy doubled down by betting he'd pull the rug out on day x.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:43:15
Pushed back? How can they be pushed back with irreversible transactions? Also, how is it easier to report on them? Even Intrade makes their decisions public, and anyone can fact check them.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:31:29
If it is to be suitable for use in financial or even monetary contracts, that risk will have to be very small indeed. If this market is successful, you'll eventually have to deal with LIBOR-style front-running for fractions of a percent.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:19:12
How did you get that one? I do not see any process for arbitrating incorrectly predicted Decisions in your white paper. There is a lot of great work on how to prevent them in the first place, but that is only half of the problem. If your market functions well 98% of the time, but those 2% are complete write offs, it won't work for most use cases.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:04:33
Sure, take the example in this truthcoin post:
They are proposing to create a synthetic dollar hedge for BTC holders. There are constant accusations (often eventually shown to be true, i.e. MtGox's willy bot) of market manipulation in the bitcoin price extending even beyond the maximum 2 month settlement period currently proposed by truthcoin.
This isn't just a small market problem either, as effectively the same thing was done to the gold price for years.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:29:11
Thanks, I understand that, but this isn't a significant difference. If you take 50 cents on the dollar out because someone caused just enough confusion in the market longer than you can afford to keep your funds tied up in a bet, do you really feel better?
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:25:45
That's fine, but it isn't decentralized. Deferring to an expert is what is currently done in prediction markets.
My issue with any "decentralized" prediction market is that the world does not offer us up unambiguous truth. Truth takes work to reveal, and more often than not the general public do not do that work. This is why &gt;50% of the US doesn't know where Iraq is.
Simply put, there is no algorithm to determine truth based on public opinion. That is like trying to refine gold from horse shit.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:50:01
 &lt;- manipulation of BTC/USD market
 &lt;- manipulation of interest rate market
 &lt;- manipulation of commodities markets
I won't even go into stock and bond markets. The examples are endless.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:12:16
Funny that you picked the Bush Gore presidency, because that in fact was not settled for months. More than the 2 month period truthcoin gives, anyway.
I don't see how you are proposing that truthcoin would allow better recourse for incorrect calls. It is practically impossible to reverse a decision that makes it through the full decision period. At least with Intrade it is theoretically possible you could sue them and win what you deserve in the end.

"Bitcoin Transaction Fee: 	Free for a while (except for Altcoins)"
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:13:31
Am I the only one that thinks this story about Japan becoming the highest volume exchange market is disingenuous? They have zero fees, like China did until recently. Their volume has not increased; China's dropped 95%. Their orderbooks are paper thin. It is just as fake as China's volume was. Everyone shakes their finger at China and shares this meme, though, as if it was an increase for Japan rather than a decrease for China...
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:34:38
That is a charge for using their FX swap, not for making a trade. That is why it is daily.
You can swap 1 BTC and pay 0.04% for the day, even if you trade that BTC back and forth 1000 times.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:26:22
I'm not a Bitflyer user so it is hard for me to argue, but that makes no sense. How can bitcoin transactions be free "(except for Altcoins)"? It is obviously talking about a pair, not a bitcoin-&gt;bitcoin transaction.
More anecdotally, it is hard to believe tens of thousands of bitcoins are being traded on an orderbook that is lucky to have a 100 BTC bid on it.
Also it doesn't say anything about maker/taker or any other exchange fees on that page, their fee page. Prove your point.

Barely. Free electricity helps. To be honest, bigger goals are education and awareness. These people are prime bitcoin user demographic, they just don't have access and information. If we mail them a getting started kit, they'll eat it up!

I think this is a great job for how fast it was done. It is clearly a fork of bitcoin.org with some thoughtful additions. The wallet bump up feature is a useful addition to help fund the expensive task of managing a site like this. The fact that ninki and blockchain.info are currently featured is just a reflection of their awareness and willingness to "bump" themselves before others.
