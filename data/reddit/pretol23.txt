I use a wallet on my pc (full node) for major fund movement and several phone based spv wallets for daily transactions. I do also use a web wallet for small convenience - mostly because I purchased my coins there.

Is that a byproduct of scores being hidden?  Reddit seems to be very strange just by itself with scores floating around even when the number of votes doesn't change.

But worrying about future growth in the technology is OK?
I think if we're looking to future proof technology, it is reasonable to look at expected growth in both usage (increase in transactions) and in hardware capabilities.  It's not like he said "if only we could get a 100x increase in hard drive / cpu / bandwidth this year"

I'm glad someone's giving this some constructive thought instead of all this FUD

If you believe we may have reached the end of death due to aging within the next hundred years.

I just paid for my night with my Coinbase account in no time at all. I do think that was pretty easy, but not really different than using paypal. Once I've got a wallet on my stinking iPhone here, it'll be much more "real" if you will.

But my computer is barely strained at all to run 1 mb blocks.  So as OP points out, why should I personally restrict the network if I personally can handle 2x, 5x, or more. At a time when I don't feel like I can handle more, I'll stop voting for further increases. I can make that decision at any time.

I don't really care who does it (I'd call more than just core as top developers). It sounds great.

This is how Bitcoin Unlimited handles block size limits.

Friend, I didn't bring Visa or Gigablocks into the discussion. I said I'm capable of more than today and have no reason to keep the 1mb limit. I have no personal reason to block Joe neighbor from buying his games on humble bundle or preventing my own cost effective purchase on Purse.io.
If it IS two years from now and some great use for Bitcoin sprang up and use Did go up by a factor of 50 and no other scaling improvements have allowed Bitcoin to be more efficient and I didn't feel it was worth paying for a better computer and faster internet, then I can stop increasing my allowed block size.
From my own capabilities and expected use of the network I have made an informed decision for today and will continue to do so.

[Yes it is.](  It give each user the option to set two flags - what size blocks they will generate and what size blocks they will accept.

Surely everything that will exist is already defined by the laws of physics!  It's only our minimal understanding that makes it seem otherwise :)
