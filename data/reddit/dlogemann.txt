If you are running a node, you can check the current state of the softfork with:
    bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
At the bottom you see:
    "bip9_softforks": [
      {
        "id": "csv",
        "status": "defined"
      }

No, it's not. Even if 95% of the majority hashrate today would mine 2 MB blocks, most of the network would ignore those blocks, because they are not valid. You wouldn't see those blocks in wallets and on exchanges.

Just for comparison some real world stats of my node (Bitcoin Core 0.13.2) that runs in a European datacenter (1 GBit/s uplink, currently 124 connections):
    ~$ bitcoin-cli getnettotals
    {
      "totalbytesrecv": 14664420775,
      "totalbytessent": 684805266459,
      "timemillis": 1486123918183,
      "uploadtarget": {
        "timeframe": 86400,
        "target": 0,
        "target_reached": false,
        "serve_historical_blocks": true,
        "bytes_left_in_cycle": 0,
        "time_left_in_cycle": 0
      }
    }
The node has been restarted a little more than 14 days ago. As you can see it needs about 1,5 TB per month with 1 MB blocks *now*. European hosters often have (temporary) traffic limits where the uplink speed is reduced or where you have to pay for extra traffic.

I don't use the wallet functionality. I run the node on a server in a datacenter in Europe which has 100 MBit/s upload and download speed. Therefore I don't want to limit the connections. Nevertheless the resource usage should be lower and will be lower with future versions, e.g. with libsecp256k1.

The wallet of average joe is connected to a random node. And that node is connected to several other random nodes. That's why nodes matter a lot: because the wallet is connected to that node and the node checks the validity of all transactions (coming from the wallet or from other nodes) and all incoming blocks using its own rules.

Of course it does: it must be the strongest *valid* chain. And the max block size (EB) setting in BU changes this mechanism, because it can be set manually and individually.

Segwit may be complex, but it is already tested thoroughly and everybody involved thinks it will work. I'm trusting the devs here.
Nevertheless: the blockchain is the important part. In a soft fork, all nodes that accept blocks before the fork will accept blocks after the fork. In a hard fork, only upgraded nodes will accept blocks after the fork. Non-upgraded nodes will reject big blocks. That is the dangerous part.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:07:14
My full node currently uses 24.4% cpu (on a quad core cpu) and approx 25 GB per day. A 2 MB block would pull 4x cpu usage in worst case, which would bring my node to its limit. Therefore it is more important to fix cpu usage and traffic issues first which will be done with Bitcoin Core 0.12.0

There is an argument: it is active now and you cannot change it without consensus. And as there is no consensus, you cannot change it.

In the early days of the internet, there were many open SMTP mail relays. You could send your mail using any of those open servers. Then the spammers misused them, and therefore today you will have a hard time to find an open mail relay, because it's considered bad practice.
Bottom line: things change when more people actually use them. Sometimes it's unfortunate, but that's how it goes. Changing a protocol to improve the situation is very hard and in the case of SMTP it's not even solved today - Spam is still a major problem. Let's hope segwit is activated soon to bring LN network into production so that transactions with small amounts and low fees are possible again.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:22:36
I think another theoretical scenario must be addressed as well: what if all nodes (full nodes and miners) have different EB settings e.g. from 100 KB to 20 MB?
@_date: 2016-01-30 06:10:10
My full node needs approx. 24% cpu (on a quad core) and transfers 25 GB a day.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:03:33
Yes, I am aware of that. But they also must assure that their BU node is connected to at least another (real) BU node or a BU miner to even see those BU blocks. And I don't know how they can guarantee this.
Possible scenario: their BU node is connected only to Bitcoin nodes and will never see a BU block at all.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:43:33
Let's say BU has 75% hashrate tomorrow and BU is happening: the first &gt;1MB block is mined. How does average joe with his wallet get his transations to BU miners and blockchain information from BU miners? For example:
Bitcoin wallet (Schildbach) connects to a random node, which is by 95% chance a core node that rejects all blocks &gt;1MB. So any transaction will almost never be displayed as confirmed.
Copay uses bitcore servers - they connect to bitcoin core nodes as well.
Mycelium connects to its own mycelium servers - will they accept &gt;1MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:35:52
Don't forget the nodes: if the nodes do not update, blocks &gt; 1 MB are invalid and will not be relayed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:20:31
What I am curious about: how can exchanges guarantee that they even see a new BU block that is greater than 1 MB in such a scenario? Do they have to connect directly to a BU miner? I am asking because all Core nodes would drop those blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:06:41
Yes, maybe - currently 122 connections.
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:26:14
As you can see from the ongoing discussions and questions: it is contentious.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:59:01
Because a contentious hard fork is a very complex and nondeterministic scenario and therefore dangerous. And as everybody can see from the ongoing discussions: this topic is contentious.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:03:38
As a full node operator, I could not agree more. This is really the most important aspect of the whole block size discussion. CPU usage, bandwidth usage and known attack vectors must be adressed first.

So, then your wallet (or your node) is directly connected to a mining node?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:36:31
It's not just one line of code (as explained numerous times by several developers), but even if it would be: remember that we are having an active running blockchain. Changing the blocksize may seem a simple change to the block but it has enormous consequences and risks for the chain.

It's not laughable: you can change a constant, but that's not the point. That only changes the block, but the 1 MB is part of the currently running *chain*. You cannot force miners or nodes to update, so you risk a chain split.

I think the whole distinction between "mining full nodes" and "non-mining full nodes" is flawed. There are full nodes and there are miners. Miners use full nodes to get a new blocktemplate to mine on and to propagate new blocks to the network. In the early days, when CPU mining was possible, the mining part was part of the bitcoin client but that's not true anymore: [the internal miner has been removed in v0.13.0](
If you think the distinction between "mining full nodes" and "non-mining full nodes" is correct, please answer two questions:
* which of the nodes that are listed on [bitnodes]( are "mining full nodes" and which are "non-mining full nodes"?
* which command of your bitcoin full node do you use to mine?
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:30:04

During the mining period they only emergency-adjust in one direction: if they are too slow. If blocks are too fast, they don't adjust until they reach 2016 blocks.

Theoretically: what if every node chooses a different blocksize, for example evenly distributed blocksizes in the range from 100 kB to 8000 kB?

I think the approach that BU is taking is way too optimistic. I think it's perfectly feasible that someone may have a monetary incentive that's completely **outside** of the bitcoin environment.
Think of this constellation:
* someone or a group of people is awfully rich
* he/she/they do(es)n't want bitcoin to succeed
* he/she/they provide(s) a monthly budget of $1M or more
* he/she/they hire(s) someone to buy and build a mining environment
* he/she/they instruct(s) them to explicitly mine in the most malicious way
Why is this not possible? I think it's quite likely to happen if a hard fork situation is evolving.

Electronic voting in every form is simply an terrible idea.
Voting has several constraints that no electronic system can fulfill:
- everybody should by able to verify the voting process and the voting results; if voting is based on software (even if it is open source), a lot of people have to trust somebody else who verifies the software for them - paper voting can by verified by anybody
- voting should be decentralized; if there is a central system where the voting happens, there is a chance that the *entire* vote can be manipulated - this is impossible for paper voting

If my phone is compromised and I'm checking out in an online store when the online store shows me 1addressthatiscorrect as a QR code and I copy that into mycelium and hacker modifies it to 1addressblahblahblah, if Trezor shows me 1addressblahblahblah I will verify and reject it and don't hit send.
@_date: 2016-10-30 14:17:06
Trezor shows the address in its own display, where you can check it prior to sending.

Please consider that if there could be attackers who may have an economic interest to destroy bitcoin and/or its credibility. Those attackers may have significant financial resources and could mine on the minority chain to establish a permanent split.

Edit: added traffic.

Storage is not a major problem, but traffic is: my full node currently serves 3 TiB a month. 
Edit: wording

Please do not consider *any* electronic system for voting. Voting has several constraints that cannot be fulfilled by any electronic system. Even the blockchain cannot fulfill all those constraints. 
For example: voting must be secret. If you would vote using the blockchain, you *could* prove that you voted for somebody. Therefore you could (a) sell your vote or in political repressive countries you could (b) confirm that you voted in the way somebody forced you to vote.

If hashcash was invented to prevent spam, wouldn't it be possible to use hashcash on transactions? Imagine it as a wallet "mining" the transaction. Or is this just a silly idea?

That's not fully correct. If the HF happens he will still have BTC and the same amount of BCC. So he still has BTC to sell.

Next difficulty retarget is approx. July 28th. If signalling remains above 95% Segwit will lock in 14 days later. Then we have a grace period of another 14 days before it activates. So activation is expected for August 25th.

Take them out to a wallet you control. App oder hardware wallet or desktop wallet are all OK.

Saying "we are a community and we need to start acting like one" (at 3:14:28 in the video) and "if you can't do xyz like us, f*ck off!" (about 20 times) in the same speech is just ridiculous.

Question is: will Roger Ver sell all his estimated 300000 BTC for BCC someday after August 1st? If yes, what will be the effect on the price of BTC and BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:38:16
Nothing. You can safely ignore the drama.

Very bad advice IMO. Nobody knows what will happen to the price. 
Just put the coins on a wallet you control. If you want to use the new altcoin and they don't support it, use your seed words to restore to a wallet that supports it.
