Tell me about it.  I noticed the bank charging me $12 for a monthly service fee. Apparently its because I didn't have a minimum amount of $1,500 in the account. ��

Everyone is so afraid of China. Yeah the price will come down if that happens but it won't be kept down. Just hodl and enjoy when the prices go down. View it as an opportunity.

Same problem here. Sent all my Bitcoin to poloniex. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:21:03
So BCI is a save wallet? Which other wallets do u guys recommend?
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:28:08
The halving is taking effect. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:44:13
Unless ur trading anytime is a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:03:35
Now is a good time to start buying. Buy periodically throughout the day or week/month. Don't get greedy you've made profit and can buy back right now at the moment  at 2016 prices. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:04:43
From what I've read it took about 6 months for the last halving to take effect. Of course nobody here can be 100% accurate as to why the price has gone up, but the halving is why so many noobs like me bought Bitcoin in 2016. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:03:11
Not stupid at all. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:09:51
Yeah it is Culver City. I should've included the Wells Fargo ATM besides it huh? Lol
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:23:08
That's one lucky person whoever got that. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 00:22:23
Yeah it is. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:36:50
Peer to peer. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:23:34
Just give it time. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:34:26
How hard do u see it crashing?
@_date: 2016-12-06 00:41:14
No I haven't, but I definitely will give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:17:32
It's a good way to stay anonymous. At least u have the peice of mind and don't have to worry about the IRS. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 16:45:45
Herocoin does 
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:29:30
It just seemed as if it was wrapped with that plastic again. And it didn't come that grey seal with the, "secure anti-tampering technology" on it. 
Oh ok. As long as it's safe to use. I bought another one just in case. Thanks
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:42:46
Thanks!!!!!!!! This is very helpful. I appreciate it. :)
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:27:46
Whats the name of this video?
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:36:44
Just take ur money. U sound broke. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:48:04
Yeah I guess coinbase was the "mainstream" option at the time. I've now become familiar with private keys and hardware wallets so I have all my bitcoins in my ledger nano. As far as an exchange I plan on trying out localbitcoins. What a better way to buy bitcoins than peer to peer right? Thanks for your input. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 04:28:01
It's a high fee. Not sure of the percentage and I suck at math, but I bought $60 worth and ended up receiving $51.75
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:10:13
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:52:58
Wow that's dope! I personally don't know anyone who owns bitcoins let alone has an actual use for it. So Bitcoin has literally changed your life as far as handling currency. I'm sure it's inevitable for Bitcoin to become widespread.
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:05:12
Nice. So u made a nice profit if u held on to it. So 4 years later how do u see Bitcoin now? Or other cryptocurrencies in general? 
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:18:03
U can give 5 to me and then try to figure out what to do with 160 BTC
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:59:56
Best of luck. For my sake I hope u fucked up and regret selling at $1,000. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:44:21
Like I've said I'm new to this cryptocurrency so me trying to argue otherwise would be dumb. I do also believe Bitcoin will reign supreme. I mean so far Bitcoin is far ahead of its "competitors". I guess we're on the same boat. I just hodl and so far I only have 2 bitcoins but hey.... that's more than all my neighbors. Lol
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:19:38
Patience is a virtue. Give it time. Throughout the 7 years of its existence Bitcoin has accomplished a lot. Odds are that 7 years from now Bitcoin will be doing a lot better than it is today. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:46:59
Herocoin is an Bitcoin ATM with no verification required. Not sure if they have those in MY though 
@_date: 2016-12-05 04:23:46
Yeah the fee sucks. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 00:58:00
This is at the Westfield mall in Culver City. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 03:34:48
Is that 1 billion dollars during hyperinflation? 
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:29:27
What can 2mm bolivars buy u in that type of economy???
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:55:13
Stop it. It's not that serious. But yeah fuck em. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:16:05
Why not start a YouTube channel and put some content out. I see a lot of youtubers getting bitcoin from donations. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:56:10
Only profitable if u have enough influence to get ppl to use ur affiliate code. Other than that it's waste of time. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:47:45
I definitely bought some. Why not? Lol
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:00:56
I have an iPhone 6s. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:42:10
I've bought 2 bitcoins before the halving and honestly I hope the price does go down so I can buy a lot more. :)
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:45:38
I hear many people say that. Why is that? 
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:31:17
I'll check it out. Why is mycelium a better option in your opinion?
@_date: 2016-07-13 15:04:10
I don't understand how u view that as failing miserably.
