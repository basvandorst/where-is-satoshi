I just wanted to thank everyone here for their responses, otherwise I wouldn't have known to contact the sender seeing as I am fairy new to the bitcoin scene. Their recent e-mail is as follows:
First off, my apologies in for the delay in responding to you. We had experienced a technical issues with one of our wallet providers. This has resulted in issues paying out some of our orders yesterday. 
Issues like this due arise occasionally, and we have found to be unavoidable when working in such a new technology and set of process/systems. We have migrated wallets so current orders are not affected.
With that said, I realise it\'s unacceptable the amount of time that you had to wait to get a response on this, it should have been faster. We also could have done a better job in communicating this issue to our customer base.
The issue has now been resolved and your bitcoins will be dispatched within the hour. Please check your wallet shortly.
Kind regards and sincere apologies for this unforeseen delay"

I guess by what you're saying is they havn't done that? See I'm fairly new to this, when I click 'wallet' on blockchain.info, enter my password and click 'my transactions' (I assume that's where the transaction ID lives) there is literally no such id related to my bitcoin purchase.

Thank you for the help. If it is just case of them not sending it, then I need to find out what they are doing sending a false e-mail and not even sending the coins at all... ugggh
