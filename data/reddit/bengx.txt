Post your entire config?
@_date: 2014-05-07 08:20:29
Is it possible to fork it to support other coins too?
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:39:28
Woah the Pheeva app looks really polished. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:04:26
Basically yeah, take that out. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:07:49
Mind if I joined you?
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:11:57
You can email in to request the holding period be dropped from 72 hours to 24 hours. My first local withdrawal took a while to process, so I emailed in regarding it and was informed about that policy. My second withdrawal took place really quickly. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:49:39
I think you're mining with scrypt mode turned on. Remove the scrypt option and you should be fine.

Can I know where he tweeted it? I can't seem to find it on his twitter. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:27:43
Oh yes, that too. Definitely have to enable 2FA regardless these days. Can never be too safe. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:43:12
If you have the app backed up on your computer in iTunes, you can always reinstall it again later. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:00:03
Use this:
color 02
    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 98
    C:\Users\cloud9\Desktop\cgminer-3.7.2-windows\cgminer.exe  -o eu-stratum.btcguild.com:3333 -u imclud9_1 -p x --lookup-gap 2 --thread-concurrency 8191 -g 2 -I 12 -w 256 --gpu-fan 80 --temp-cutoff 90 --temp-overheat 85 --temp-target 72 --gpu-memclock 1500 --gpu-engine 1050 --gpu-powertune -20 --expiry 1 --scan-time 1 --queue 0 --no-submit-stale
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:47:26
What are you mining with?
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:46:04
The txid on blockchain.info is b9036c794b2692406c1bd3d584b9f7ff683861c4cd90492fb4d106e8bca9f29d, but it's not seen on blockr.io. Think you might have to wait it out a little longer. Seems like no fees were attached too. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:57:59
Which wallet did you use to send your BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:29:21
Yeah. But you can use the coinjar app to make bitcoin transfers. Even the blockchain app works, although it hasn't been updated to parity with the android version. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:37:31
I agree, at first I thought it was a 160BTC transaction too. If OP meant 160,000, he should have used a comma instead of a period.
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:43:09
The Bitcoin CEO declared bankrupt in Japan too. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:44:44
Doesn't list Bitcoin anywhere anymore. So yeah.
@_date: 2014-05-06 10:10:48
Yes, hi, what's up?
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:57:30
This again?
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:02:40
Nanyang Technological University from Singapore here, no go either :(
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:22:48
It says the reason right there, must be legal in the countries which the app is being distributed in. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:12:18
Sorry, try this first and see if it launches. 
color 02
    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 98

@_date: 2014-03-07 02:33:01
First meta is not a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2014-04-25 09:29:28
Details? Txid, address, etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:44:04
Sandboxing makes it harder though, unless the phone is jailbroken. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:26:19
Seems like a completely different issue not relating to change addresses. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:10:23
I've used itbit twice so far, no issues with both fiat and bitcoin withdrawals. Fiat withdrawal was pretty quick, got it in my bank account within 2 days. I live in Singapore where itbit is based, so maybe that's why fiat withdrawal was pretty quick.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:52:24
Nope, won't automatically delete. If you have a back up on the computer, you can always reinstall it even if you change phones later on. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:04:20
Apps are sandboxed, meaning they cannot access the data of other apps unless you are jailbroken. If you are concerned about it access your location data and contacts data, all those can be controlled within the Privacy section in the Settings app.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:14:00
Oooh first time I heard of NuMoney. CoinHako prices are quite a bit higher though, right? Good for selling, not so good for buying. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:23:48
You can, with the coinjar app. Or even blockchain app. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:01:34
Agreed with this. There's also hardly any use of Bitcoins here too. If only more places locally accepted Bitcoins, then who knows the trading volume on fybsg might pick up. I saw a guy on the local forums selling a computer case accepting BTC, but so far that's the only one time I saw it being used in the local context.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:19:52
There's coinjar too that's still on the App Store which can be used to send and receive bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:12:49
I had the exact same problem the other day too. Lost my authenticator because of a software bug but I didn't save the QR code or the private keys.  I was lucky I had a back up of my phone I could restore to, or else I would be missing out on my coins too. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:26:21
Purchasing with litecoins would be great too! :)
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:09:09
Pretty sure it's 30%, not 40%. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:27:31
All right, thanks! At least I roughly know how long to wait. They don't seem to have any rough estimate on when they will reply anywhere on their page except for 12/7. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 13:12:09
Yeah, I just got myself un-shadowbanned today too. Turns out I was banned originally for being in a vote brigade a long time ago, whatever vote brigade even means. I was posting some helpful comments the other day. I noticed that there were no interest in it at all and I checked my user profile to see that it doesn't exist.
