yeah! this is fair. 
i was going for an educated guess but if the money was lost it would've been really bad.

Been following Bitcoins for 2 years now. Learned about it mostly off off coindesk.
Last year i told my mom to buy bitcoin when it was only $950 (somewhere in November, irrc). She didn't listen to me and i just showed her this right now and she brushed it off 'cause apparently "internet money" is not the same as real money. Her lack of understanding cost us thousands we could have made in profits.
I swear if i had my own money to invest i would be a fucking millionaire by now.

besides, all i am saying is that if she got what bitcoin was and actually listened to me instead of swaying away my opinion just because i am a kid, we **could** have made some really good money.

so, i should not blame my mom 'cause "it's lame as hell"?
What kind of reason is that?
i would say that i am being reasonable, blaming her because if she had kept up with technology we could have made magnificent amounts of profit which could also have helped her.
i mean say we bought in 5 coins back then, we could have had 25000 on a 4700 investment. 
It is her money, she can do with it whatever she wants but i am talking about her gain here which would have indirectly also been my gain.
