I'm not a heavy trader, but I know I routinely saw transactions on the order of ~25 btc just on the blockchain.info ticker.
Assuming those are actually routine, it would probably take 25x that amount all at once to really noticeably move the market on a typical day, on top of the 25 btc transactions already occurring.
So it would take a movement of about $280,000 all on "buy" or "sell" across most exchanges to really move the price per btc noticeably. But I suspect that would still be a minor movement, and would only be noticed if there was a reason to notice it.

Generally speaking, whatever the volume is at the current offer or bid price. If you buy or sell more than that, the next higher/lower price moves to the top of the trading market.
Technically speaking, all purchases or sales move the price noticeably, on the margin.
But to your point: all transactions can be "noticed." If you were trying to move the price, anyone could inspect the blockchain to see what was done. If you were trying to make a "big move" without affecting the price, you couldn't do it with your primary transactions alone: you would also need social hacking to get the rest of the market to move against you in precisely the right way to hide your maneuvers in the top-level price data. But even then, social manipulation can only go so far before actual economic considerations find the equilibrium in price.

I've heard decent things about breadwallet, but haven't tried it out much yet.

You say it's time to talk, but then you don't say anything. Are you my wife?

At least they also demonized their own cash...
It really shows that anything that makes it easy to actually give money from one person to another is what they despise. 
Like a grandparent to a grandchild for their birthday, across any distance. 
Why? Because then the transaction can't be monitored and taxed. It's not about terrorism, its about control.

I remember back in 2013, when this was obviously one of the biggest use-cases for Bitcoin.
Now with the fees and "layered solutions", Bitcoin is unusable in developing markets.
$10 transaction fees aren't going to help a token become a currency when people are making $3/day.

I think you mis-read him.
He said he can still enjoy military and spy FICTION. Implying that this is despite his disdain for those functions IRL.
