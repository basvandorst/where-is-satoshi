oh, lol...didn't notice the coin was p-shopped in! I was wondering how somebody took the time to paint it and didn't notice...

Looks dope, but is the B backwards on the space coaster coin?
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:29:58
Oh I completely agree that it is irrelevant. Especially considering that the unit of measure is arbitrary and unrelated. Just trying, in a very poorly worded way, to express the thought that people are willing to assign some level of value to a otherwise valueless item based only on trust. Trust that others think that is what it is worth
For example, I feel comfortable buying that yellow metal at $1250, because I am so certain one day I can sell it. If I thought there was a high chance that it could be valued like aluminum tomorrow I would be unlikely to use it as an investment and so would others, driving the price down. The value of bitcoin and gold is based on a collective trust.

So after you pointed that out I made a cropped version that is flipped so that the B is the correct orientation. I also darkened it up a bit (I like darker backgrounds)
Here's what it looks like (screenshot makes it look darker than it is)
Here is the image for whoever wants it

Should be an interesting post from the OP tomorrow after the warm fuzzies wear off. Always fun to read posts you never realize you made the night before.

My clock is in a bit different place, so the non-mirrored works well

When Bitcoin goes up, I buy more Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes down, I sell my Bitcoin cheap. It hasn't worked very well so far.

The risk is not physical destruction, outlawing, or any of these things. It is trust. If everyone suddenly decided that Bitcoin is not worth the amount we say it is today the value will of course drop. This could be because Bitcoin itself loses trust or something comes along that people trust more. If something comes along that stole Bitcoin's network effect it would not destroy Bitcoin, it would just drop its value to some level.
Bitcoin has built a lot of trust. I would say that is why it is nearing parity with Gold. Gold could also lose its value any day. For all we know we could capture a gigantic space rock that makes Gold the most common material on Earth. The reason Gold has so much trust is that is highly unlikely and it has thousands of years of historic value.
We also can trust that the blockchain works and that it is the most secure ledger in the world. 
Unfortunately, we can not be 100% sure that there will never be more than the 21 million. If we knew this 100%, there would be more trust in Bitcoin. We can be highly certain Bitcoin will exist because of its distributed nature. If every node went offline, Bitcoin investments would be the lest of your worries

Ha! I didn't even notice the original had the B backwards.

So frustrating. I should have known. Was in the middle of some trades and can't login now. I have no idea how much I have lost or what orders are open/filled...ugh. Pretty sure I am losing money as we speak.

Paid a $5k fine?
It says he was mining from March 2012 to June 2014 on fed servers, yet was only charged this year. I wonder if he hodl'd all this time!

Thank you for posting these rules for art. If we could, it would be nice to have a detailed list of what is and is not allowed so we can all properly do acceptable art that does not offend any group of people

How about this to blow your mind. If the current users of this sub had donated $0.10 to this fund 10 months ago, it would be worth enough now to get that 2 seconds of airtime.
With the extreme increase of bitcoin value it would make since somebody eventually actually do something. If a fund was started back on the earliest time I have seen one of these threads, the value increase in BTC likely would have bought it by now

The point is that without more info, we do not know what they would get. In the US you get a 30% tax credit which is $10,440. Many utilities and jurisdictions have additional rebates or credits worth $2k+,  which would be around that amount...not such a half-baked miracle

I have been in solar for a decade, own a solar business and instruct at a college. This example will be far too long of a read, but will give you the math to get started.
As somebody mentioned, your situation will be largely based on your solar availability which means the average amount of sun in your area, orientation, shading obstacles, etc. It will also be influenced by your country/jurisdictions electrical utility rates and regulations. We would need to know much more to work out the math, but this example should get you close
For the sake of this argument I will assume you are in the US, pay an average of $0.12/kWh, and get an annual average of 5 peak sun hours.
If you are using the Antminer S17 Pro, you will get 50TH/s at 1975 Watts.  Running 24 hours a day you will use 47.4kWh/Day, or 17.3MWh/year. At the $0.12/kWh rate this energy would cost $2076/year
To offset 17.3MWh/year with solar, assuming an annual average \~5 peak sun hours and making a few other assumptions, you would need around a 12kW PV system. The installed costs vary throughout the US, but around $2.90/W installed may be a ballpark number to use. This means the system would cost around $34,800 installed.
Mining at 50TH/s should generate 0.72BTC per year based on today's calculations. Based on today's rate, that is worth $3753. Combined with the annual electrical savings of $2076/year, that works out to an annual benefit of $5829.
If your system costs $34,800 to install, after rebates and tax credits you may have a net cost of lets say $22,000. This gives you a simple payback of 3.77 years. If you are operating this as a business there would be additional accelerated depreciation and other tax scenarios to take advantage of.
Keep in mind that this is assuming that hashrate does not go up and that BTC value does not decline. In a worst case scenario, if BTC value goes to zero this system would take 10.6 years for simple payoff.
This example is for ONE miner. You would multiply this by how many miner you would have. Keep in mind that your rates, sun vailablity, etc will vary significantly from this example.
So in the end it is a GREAT investment of you have $35k to tie up in investment for 3-4 years (per miner) as it will pay for itself and will save you a couple grand per year for multiple decades after. 
With all that said, it is unlikely that that your utility will allow you to connect this size system if you do not currently have this high of use. It is also pretty obvious that hashrate continues to rise. I would personally never recommend this long term of an investment in bitcoin mining. It would be foolish. Somebody else mentioned batteries, that is not an option with mining (at least not financially). BITC is worth $5285 today. You would be better off (IMHO), purchasing 4BTC, which would take you almost 6 years to mine and sit on that. Maybe one day you can sell it at a profit and buy a reasonable solar system for your hom
