Hold forever, make a lot less money too. Lock in profits if you can.
Most coins I have are at a net cost of $0. More than paid for by locking in profits with sell/buy orders. If your coin drops however, you're actually losing money. I'm not.

One real reason the volatility of Bitcoins price is not a good thing -- the fact that it really makes investing in alt coins very difficult. If the price would stabilize then people would stop moving their coins back and forth from alts to Bitcoin and alt coins might actually go up instead of just spiking now and then and then plummeting. 
ETH and Litecoin isn't doing so well and nearly every time that I look at TradingView 20 or so alt coins on my list are just doing very badly. Usually there's 1-3 that are doing alright when the rest are diving. 
Just seems like until things stabilize with all this insanity lately that alt coins just aren't going to really move up healthily and be worth anything talking about.
It's getting depressing sometimes, waiting for Bitcoin to stop going up. Even if it's making me money. I want to see alt coins start doing well and stop suffering from it.

Yes, this is nonsense that you can deposit something unverified, but must be verified to withdrawal it. Anyone that says this is not completely bogus isn't thinking clearly. I've seen at least one other person state that this happened to them somewhere.
If you walked onto a car lot and purchased a car and then could not leave with the car because of a problem with your ID not scanning correctly on their scanner, everyone would be pretty pissed.
Anything can go wrong in the verification process. They could deny you even though you are the person that you claim to be and submit the correct documents. They don't have to verify you if they don't want to. The process could fail for one reason or another. 
The sites have serious support problems and often don't respond at all or do so a month later. Then you are shit out of luck.

Until there is a certain amount of adoption an investment is exactly what crypto is, regardless of how people feel about it being that. But honestly people are investing in what they believe in. So that is good. If people believe in BCH they will invest in it.

I understand that thinking. 
A lot of us even though in for a hold, want to trade if there's a sudden position of profit. I just can't personally see paying the fees every time I want to make a trade (and waiting). The possibility of losing them is in dire need of a fix and a very serious obstacle to 'mass adoption'. People can't possibly expect the world to take crypto currency seriously until that's addressed. 
But at the same time even if exchanges were a very safe place to hold coins, you should still be able to hold them on wallets in the future, even if those can be lost. The same as having cash in a wallet.

It was definitely one of the most boring episodes of BBT that I've seen and I mostly enjoy the show. But the episode positive for Bitcoin? The way it was written it brought absolutely no positive information. The opposite. The entire episode was about learning of the price of Bitcoin, remember that they mined it and then trying to find it.
Did it bring in buyers? More than likely. I had expected that. 
The episode honestly seemed like they put no real effort into it at all. These geniuses seemed to know nothing about Bitcoin whatsoever. Not even Sheldon had anything technical to say. And they claimed that *they* wrote a program to mine Bitcoin? What the hell? It was weird.

It's not that bad. The fees aren't going to harm you that much. Very little in fact. Though I guess as volatile as fees are right now, you could get burned a little bit. But I've not seen much more than a .15/.25% fee. 
I've done trades for as little as $50-200 profit here and there for practice. Buy and wait for it to go up. When it goes high enough to your liking for the profit you will accept, you sell. When it goes back down low enough to buy back, you do. There is just a waiting game in between which could be several days or weeks right now or more depending on how much profit you want to make. Just don't do it with a currency that you don't want to hold.
I stopped doing it, but I haven't really lost anything yet. If you follow simple rules and just don't risk more than you wouldn't mind holding if needed, it's not *that* bad.
Of course I am not a professional, but following simple rules and being prepared to hold onto a currency you would otherwise not mind holding makes it much less of a risky thing to do.
That said, don't do what I do.

Assuming that the price goes above what you paid for it, you are correct. You don't get control of the Bitcoin until the transfer completes, but the price you purchased it for is locked in and any percentage increase on the price does become profit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:14:30
It's about percentage gain. The price of a whole Bitcoin doesn't matter. It's how much you invest and how much percentage gain there is on that investment and that is determined by the percentage gain of the coin. 
In reality Bitcoin isn't the best investment.
Look at Coinbase as an example. 
* 1 Year:
* BTC +1988.81%
* ETH +5620.12%
* LTC +3951.9%
What was the best investment 1 year ago today?
Though one year from now if you invested today, we can't guess what will have the highest gain.
If you think that Bitcoin will crash in the next year, then you could have likely made far better investments anyway.
Diversify. Put money in more than one coin if you're that worried.

There is no real risk. They are just as well equipped at doing the job. I've done it several times there. In fact, they often do a better job with less pain. I've met some really good doctors and dentists that helped me.
One doctor "fixed" a screw up by a visiting dentist when my dentist was retiring. The visiting dentist did a root canal and it turns out the post stuck through the tooth into my bone or gum below the tooth, causing a cyst and abscesses.  For whatever reason, this went unnoticed as the cause for years until I was in Ukraine. The cyst was removed and the teeth were pulled (by the dentist mentioned below) and I just needed to get a bridge after this.
When a dentist pulled the two teeth, I didn't feel any pain during or after the procedure (except for a little bit of mildly annoying pressure against my lip while she worked it out). I didn't need any narcotics/pain killers (just the usual anesthesia/needle). They gave me a prescription for some herbal medication to rinse with to keep the area clean.
Also sought help for hyperthyroidism there. I was given care for a few months while there and my medication was dropped from about 40mg of methimazole to about 5mg, while keeping an eye on everything with blood work. This reduced the possible issues caused by an excessive amount of medication with the same result. Something doctors here in the US never attempted to do.
Every doctor or dentist is different of course. Some perform root canals without feeling anything at all. Some are pretty rough with it and it will really make your jaw sore. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:23:12
I haven't done a cleaning there yet. I've had root canals, teeth pulled, fillings and some teeth redone where there were some bad areas near the gum line. 
Was supposed to do some serious work on my jaw which required wearing a plastic device in my mouth for some time, lots of work on my teeth, crowns, etc to re-align my jaw but I didn't have enough time. It's about a 6 month process. For whatever reason my jaw is aligned in a screwed up way and my teeth grew in naturally to align with where it is.

The answer would be mostly yes, because cryptocurrency, especially BTC always falls again and you can just simply buy back more when it falls. In the end you have more than you started with. So there is no reason not to. Unless you just don't want to get involved with trading. Which I can understand. 
It's not as difficult as many would lead everyone to believe though and it's pretty difficult to fail especially when you're intention was to hold for a really long time anyway, because with that stance it really doesn't matter what it's doing over those periods of time that you wouldn't sell anyway. If the potential is there to make money, go for it. The rules are so simple and the only way you fail is by doing something absurd like buying high and selling low.
But I won't get into it. People can do whatever they want. It doesn't really matter. It's not my pocket.

"We are verifying your identity and will be in touch shortly. Gemini is currently experiencing extremely high application volume so please allow up to two weeks for the compliance team to complete its review."
This is nice. What a wonderful world this Bitcoin is. Extremely time sensitive purchases (even more than stocks) and it's impossible to get into it any acceptable time frame with any source whatsoever. So many sites only allow account bank transfers which are always very slow. This is so unacceptable in a trading marketplace that it's mind boggling.
Also, there's no option on Gemini to use a debit/credit card. Just bank/wire.
Sigh. What a shit show this "industry" is.

* Never give keys, codes, etc.
* Use a computer that is secure. Do not look at porn on this computer. Do not click anything even remotely risky on this computer. The less you do anything BUT trade/access Bitcoin exchanges on this computer the better.
* Consider a wallet (not exchange) if you plan to hold the coins rather than trade often.
* Don't access or trade on public wi-fi. 
* Don't lose your wallet.
* Make backups if you use a wallet. The more the better. Personally if I had a large sum in a wallet I would put one in a fire safe box.

Coinbase verification is quite a laughing stock. I tried multiple times to verify a card days ago. It claimed that the pending amounts were incorrect. I can assure you that they were not. Locked out of doing so for 24 hours twice.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:15:19


What won't work?
I've only used bank transfer on Coinbase (just $50). It's been days. It has cleared on my account but I still can't access it Coinbase yet. Bank transfer always takes several days.
Coinbase's card verification is screwed up right now. When entering the pending charges amounts in the verification form fields, they are denied. I've tried for over 48 hours. Still waiting on a reply from them to get it fixed.
No point in really trying bank transfer anywhere else since it will take a while everywhere and I can... supposedly do it on Coinbase and already have started one there. But it outright refuses a card verification on Coinbase and 6+ sites haven't allowed it at all or in the US/my state.
One hell of a frustrating problem.

Using a phone for authentication is so absurd. I've maintained this for years. Numbers change too often. Phones can *easily* be stolen and are *very often*. Minimum is that you lose the ability to login. The worst case is that you lose money or something like a World of Warcraft account (and money) with thousands of hours and potentially $100s-1000s of subscription time. People are constantly complaining about a lost, stolen or destroyed phone on Facebook.
There needs to be a better way and I really do not like the idea of using a phone to verify yourself.

It can take several days for the money to even show as pending with a bank transfer, much less actually withdraw the money from your account. You should be fine.

There is no buy without having the money on your account in the first place... that is what I'm waiting for so that I can buy. At least I thought so? I was trying to add money to my account. The way the site was setup it made it appear as though I needed the money in the account first to actually buy BTC. Though Coinbase for example is setup in such a weird way that the UI literally has one option one minute and the next it's not there (seen it do that multiple times).
Ok, I guess I can do that. I literally did not realize it. The site was being really weird the other day. One minute I could use a card, the next the option wasn't there, several times for example.
That sucks. Because I tried to buy BTC at about 6450.

You can verify this anywhere. Regardless of whether it is a variation of simply "ze" or some various fantasy creature, you can be fined for refusing to use them in some areas already.
Proof that laws are being created to force you to use any gender neutral pronoun chosen -- violation could mean simply refusing to use a gender neutral pronoun:
"Examples of Violations a. Intentional or repeated refusal to use an individual’s preferred name, pronoun or title. For example, repeatedly calling a transgender woman “him” or “Mr.” after she has made clear which pronouns and title she uses."
"Discrimination against a transgender individual could result in fines of up to $250,000... According to the new guidelines, the commission can impose civil penalties of up to $125,000 for violations of the law and (in extreme circumstances) of up to $250,000 for violations that are the result of “willful, wanton, or malicious” conduct."
There's a start for you.

People announce a lot of things. Very few to nearly none here have actually made money with crypto though. Especially holders. Those that did make money, made a lot of it and have no desire to talk about it here.
P.S. Those that have 1 BTC aren't going to suddenly be super wealthy in 4 years. Dream on if you think so. If you wanted that then you should have gotten as many shares as you can a long time ago.

You learn a lot traveling around the world. You especially learn that Americans are brainwashed beyond comprehension into thinking they live in the greatest country in the world, no question, no buts and/or ifs and it's complete nonsense and false. 
Oh and most Americans are fat and it's not their fault of course.

I've seen countless people in countries where they make the equivalent of 21,000 rupees with iPhones and Internet that even worked in the subway. It's kind of surprising how such poor people can always afford an iPhone. If you can afford an iPhone you can own and trade crypto.
Just saying.

Where are you basing this claim that you know who this person is? So far I've yet to see any reason to make such a claim other than trolling. Don't repeat what other people say just to sound intelligent. The opposite occurs.

Not at all true. Multi-year holds, sure. Unless something changes pretty drastically, recent history completely defies this statement.

Do you not realize that there is probably about a 98% chance that BTC will not exist in 18 years? The odds are that it will no longer exist, to be replaced by another crypto currency or crypto currency might not exist at all in 18 years (whether it just didn't pan out or something new and better replaces it). Who knows what can happen in 18 years. Nearly everyone agrees that most crypto currencies will not exist in a much shorter time.
You're really gambling with this idea.

Well, in a sense this is correct. Bitcoin is one of the worst investments of all the coins available. The percentage gain on its best days is very low in comparison to many others.

I don't think anyone has ever claimed that *regular* people are the ones doing it or capable of doing it. I don't care or have an opinion on what is happening, but that statement is pretty ridiculous.

Sure, if Bitcoin.tax didn't have severe bugs with multiple exchanges imported in. I paid for it and can not use it. Spent a week or two trying to resolve the issues and could not. Contacted them - no response. Wasted money.
For now, I will simply report what I cashed out. If they have a problem with that, that's their problem and we can talk about it later. There is no infrastructure for this anywhere and that's their fault. It's like asking to bake a cake in a linen closet.

That tired nonsense doesn't hold up to reality.
There were no taxes (income for example) until 1913 in the US. We still had firefighters. We still had roads.
You should read a book or something, instead of just spewing things from your face hole with no thought preceding it.
When logical thought actually enters your mind you will realize that taxes could be exceptionally low if the government would stop spending money on things like constant wars, giving money away overseas to governments and terrorists, etc. Often you see people win 100-500 million dollars in the education lottery, but the tax on those winning obviously isn't going to education or students. One day you're going to realize the government only exists to screw you. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:29:00
Yea, we can't argue that it's not better in different ways. When you've done a lot of traveling though you really realize that America isn't this amazing magical place that everyone pretends it to be. Or that it's superior to everywhere else like they try to make you believe. So many other countries are great in just as many ways and better in others. And every country has its negatives.
The fat thing: once I started traveling overseas it was mind blowing to me. There are months that I was overseas that I would see maybe 2-3 overweight people. This was in Europe. Then I would come home and 9/10 people were overweight everywhere I would go. It really opens your eyes to the fact that there is a serious problem.
Also, people in Europe look *so* much healthier in so many of the places I've been (better skin, healthier hair, higher energy, etc).

I always feel a lot better when I'm in Europe. I have more energy. I also have hyperthyroidism and that becomes a *lot* more manageable. The random exhaustion that I experience during the day in the states isn't as much of a problem there.

It's a pretty fucked up thing indeed. It can lead to really getting fucked over.
Land of the Free is a myth. Plenty of countries are as free or more free. We're not the exception or even a leader in that or most other things people pride America on. There are benefits to living in a lot of countries. America too. The superiority complex definitely isn't deserved though.

They should still come with CD. As well as should come with a USB for flash drives. I started using flash drives in my cars in 2006 or 2007. I don't think it's time to start phasing out CD to the point that we can't use our music CDs.

They can still do the same damn things to crypto. Hell, they have done more than enough already in the past 2 years. You people think cryptocurrency is immune to all of the problems that fiat has. It is NOT. In fact it is immune to almost none of the problems fiat has. These unrealistic expectations are dangerous for you.
