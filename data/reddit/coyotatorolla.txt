Looks like it's time to diversify into Litecoin.

It will redistribute it into the hands of a new 1% and will still be unbalanced.

bitcoin is for holding, litecoin is for spending.

$10k is pennies for this man, just keep it in perspective.

As long as people have to risk the loss or report the gain as income on every transaction they make with crypto then I don't think so. 
@_date: 2019-11-24 04:24:35
Lmao bitcoin is the ultimate tracking system. Once they figure out your wallet, that's it.

I'm sure he found out about bitcoin on the darkweb doing all that anti sex-trafficking work he did.

Buy a Trezor or a Ledger and you're not having to deal with any of this. I do like the idea off a clean, mostly offline, dedicated laptop to access the hardware wallets though. I take that precaution.
@_date: 2019-08-01 05:22:57
That would be acceptable.

0.000076 BTC for a lemonade and 2 cookies? I'd buy.

PSA - I've been HODLing for 2 years or so, have to take all my money out of bitcoin for 12 days this Friday. Murphy's law dictates that the price will skyrocket.

While the technology is tremendous, if is the process I have to currently go through to buy something with BTC:
1. Exchange local fiat currency for BTC 
2. Take on risk of loss with BTC value dipping between exchange and purchase 
3. Purchase item with BTC 
4. If value went up between exchange and purchase, report each transaction's gain as income/revenue for end of year taxes 
  
It will never go mainstream. Can you see why something big has to happen, like a crypto currency adopting presidential candidate maybe?  Until then... HODL.

bitcoin goes up, while I wait to get paid and put my investment back in (short on funds)
@_date: 2019-02-27 06:38:01
big if true
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:42:55
Pro-Crypto policy is still needed to make this mainstream. If for every transaction I need to convert fiat to crypto, then take risk of price dipping before my purchase, or have to report the marginal revenue from gains on the crypto spent because it went up in value, then no one will want to adopt this as mainstream...
