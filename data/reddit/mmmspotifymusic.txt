Mind explaining how you would go about successfully regulating decentralized currency?
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:02:23
I was under the impression this was already the case, I mean Gox is in a world of shit as it stands now. Its not like they some how found a stealing loophole and now authorities can't do anything about it.
from &gt;Bitcoin exchanges are already subject to money transmitter regulations. I don't see what's going to change. If anything, an assurance from regulators that Bitcoin exchanges that follow the required AML/KYC rules are legal and have the required licenses will allow regulated exchanges to open in the US, so that people aren't forced to use opaque exchanges overseas.

Bought a few gift cards and games off Bitmit.net recently. I usually pay my phone bill with BTCbuy.info this last time was just before they closed so I'll have to find an alternative site. I also pay for a VPN service with Bitcoin.

Surely there are more places that accept Bitcoin, the map only shows 5 for me. None in NYC where I know a business or 2 takes Bitcoin.

Awesome, I emailed them months ago asking for them to accept Bitcoin in the humble store and not just on the bundles. Good to see they made the BTC icon more prominent then just a small link it was in the payment options.

Their concerns with Bitcoin hardly equate to them condemning Bitcoin. Just because they don't happen to be as high on Bitcoin as I am doesn't mean that they are unworthy of my donation.

I've used  for this a few times now without issue. you could also use a service like bitspend but i see they are not taking orders atm
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:40:08
You can get some good prices on some things when buying with bitcoin, I often see amazon gift codes and steam games being sold at a nice discount for people looking to get BTC.
But if your not looking to splurge try buying stuff you normally buy but using BTC instead. Paying your cell phone bill, buying food, switching webhost to one that accepts bitcoin etc.

digitalh3rmit already mentioned Bitspend which I haven't tried yet. I usually just buy an Amazon gift code [Bitmit]( has a few listings up.

Just tried using this with a very cheap [Samsung a107]( prepaid GoPhone using an ancient [Openwave]( browser I was able to login and send some BTC without issue, typing out the mixed upper and lower case address on the number pad was slow as hell but it worked.

You can't blame people for not trusting a couple of brand new 1 post accounts commenting on a company without any proof of purchase and or trust in the reviewer, it doesn't carry weight.

And just like that 2 downvotes... looking at the rest of your comments i'd say you must have a bot following you and downvoting your post or just some pissed off person doing it manually.


To an extent but sourcing your facts would help.

I would think Bitspend knows when it will feel safe doing business again but outside from that my guess is once the exchanges settle down and DDOS attacks are dealt with. In the mean time try  if you need to buy something tech related.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:31:24
I'd rather they just work rather than look look nice but I get what you're saying. Google up on any site, most of these bitcoin sites have a thread on bitcointalk with feedback.
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:29:05
Just my guess, contact support if you haven't already.

They probably still have the newbie section where you have to make 5 quality post then ask to be white listed. You also have to spend a certain amount of time logged in, 4 hours or so IIRC.

Every time I see stuff like this coming from BFL I just remind my self that I have no vested interest in that shit-house of a company then I calm down a little. I wish the best to those who are waiting on their  pre-orders I'll be surprised if they get anything close to what they ordered if anything at all.

I haven't used Mt. Gox so I do not know for sure but other code based systems like Amazon's and Steam's go by a first come first serve basis.
I think you just posted your code you were supposed to redeem and someone else claimed it... I hope that i'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:59:35
Very cool I didn't notice that.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:06:29
I wasn't talking about their FPGAs, I think they are in over their head with ASICs but having produced a real product before really helped build confidence in the company and fueled the millions and millions of dollars worth of pre-orders which they are still taking in case anyone else wants to get in on this, I hear they are shipping in 2 weeks! /s&gt;

I forgot to add a miners fee a few days ago and it took that transaction almost 24 hours to get confirmed.
Did you forget to add a fee? Or does CampBX not give you the option? 0.0002 btc would have had that tx confirmed quickly.
