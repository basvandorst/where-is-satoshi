While looking into this, I came across another relevant post: [Coinplug Wins Banking Prize With Blockchain Tech That Could Save Korea from Internet Explorer](
After reading the comment and the article, I still fail to understand how this Blockchain ID service saves Korea from the horrifying e-commerce system based on digital certificate verified with IE-ActiveX plugin.
The ID service system is based on:


I'm wondering:
* How does this ID service system of one bank (KB Kookmin Card) help getting rid of the current digital certificate based system?
* Is this just a first step of the larger goal? If so, any guess what the next step is? Is Coinplug pushing FidoLedger to be the nationwide ID service system?
* Is there any guarantee that this new ID system will not bring more chaos into the already complicated e-commerce process? (I use KB Kookmin card, and apparently, the service will launch in about a month..)
* I don’t completely understand the technology, but I can’t see why this is a suitable use case of Blockchain. Could someone explain why this is actually a good idea?
* Has there been any successful case of using Blockchain as ID service system in other countries, any studies done in academia, or is this first of its kind?
* I feel Korea tends to jump into new trends without doing the homework; digital certificate disaster, early adoption of EMV chip-pin cards with virtually no one using chip reader, etc. Could this ID service system turn into another one of those?
