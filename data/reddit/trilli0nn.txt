Bitcoin proofs to be immature when almost 120,000 BTC are stolen from an exchange in a single hack. It casts doubts around its overall safety and whether Bitcoin can survive in the long run. The ability to efficiently trade is crucial for Bitcoin.
The Bitfinex hack shows once again that its victims are at the mercy of the exchange and don't have any recourse. Worse, an exchange feigning to have be hacked but stealing coins themselves would likely get away with that too, which makes putting BTC in an exchange like Russian roulette.
Any weakness or doubt about its chances of survival is immediately reflected by the BTC exchange rate. The price confirms this: BTC needs to increase by 20% to recover to its previously stable levels at around USD 680.
To regain its lost appeal and to avoid giving regulators and legislators reasons to curtail or even outlaw Bitcoin exchanges then these hacks have to urgently stop.
The best way is to enhance the protocol such that it gives exchanges and large holders *transparant* means to securing their bitcoin. That means that anyone looking at the blockchain should be able to verify that it is impossible to steal these Bitcoin. Enhancing the protocol by adding the ability to reverse transactions  under special protocol-defined circumstances has been proposed. That seems to make sense and perhaps there are even smarter ways.
Clearly, something must happen on the protocol level to make trading safe and prevent these ridiculous hacks from happening. It is very damaging.

It is crucial for Bitcoin to become more secure. Eric Lombrozo is wrong to put all responsibility on the exchanges and users.
An exchange can currently claim to be hacked and steal the funds themselves. There is no way any user of an exchange can protect themselves against this.
The protocol must urgently be upgraded to make this impossible. Exchanges must be able to keep their users Bitcoin in a way that is demonstrably and verifiably safe.
For instance, Bitcoin should enable storing large amounts of bitcoin in an address that has a daily limit, so that it is impossible for 120,000 bitcoin to be taken away in hours time.
The safety measure is visible on the blockchain, so traders can be reassured that it is impossible for an exchange to lose all funds almost instantly.
I have a hard time imagining a use case where USD 70 million worth of BTC need to move in hours. Bitcoin should allow this to be made impossible, so there is time to respond.

Exactly right! Only criminals have a reason to hide in secrecy. Law abiding citizens have no reason to hide anything and it is everone's duty to fully inform the authorities of their buying habits.
Also, everyone will understand that since wiretapping has become increasingly difficult, encryption should be outlawed. Furthermore, terror plans are made at home, authorities must have the right to install microphones in anyone's home and feed it to speech recognition software which ofcourse flawlessly filters for topics only discussed by druglords, kiddie porn dirtbags and terrorists.
Clearly, only a drug dealer, pedophile or a terrorist would oppose this. Law abiding citizen have nothing to fear.

Good thinking. Likewise, after an emergency reversal, the attacker can immediately resend the stealing transaction, which also ties up the coin in a send-reverse loop, only in this scenario the attacker can do it using the private keys of the original address.
I'm wondering if it is possible to engineer transactions such that a subsequent transaction can only use a limited set of addresses. For instance, a trader sends BTC to an exchange using a special transaction. The resulting bitcoin at the destination address of this transaction can only be sent to two addresses, and at the discretion of the exchange: to a predefined address provided by the trader, and to a predefined address chosen by the exchange. Effectively, the bitcoin are either returned to the trader, or sent onwards to a predefined address controlled by the exchange. Now, the attacker requires keys of two addresses and perform two transactions in order to steal the coins.

These exchange hacks severely harm the credibility of Bitcoin as a currency. That's clearly reflected by the price which has still not recovered to levels before the hack, when it was stable at ~ USD 670-690.
It would be a big mistake to shrug off these exchange hacks as irrelevant to the ultimate success of Bitcoin.  That's simply not true. It is crucial for Bitcoin to be able to be efficiently traded. As it stands, funds at any exchange can just be taken away from traders without anyone getting caught. That's just unacceptable.
These events can and probably will cause regulators around the world to impose stringent rules upon exchanges making it almost impossible to run one, a la the New York BitLicense. That's not what we want.
Therefore the Bitcoin protocol must be improved in a way that enables exchanges to more effectively protect themselves from being hacked. It is very urgent.
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:37:31
Sure. Now what stops any exchange from claiming to be hacked and steal  customers deposits?
Protocol level changes are required to make this harder if not impossible.

What makes something a killer app?
A killer app implements a popular function in a way far superior to the next best implementation.
So a killer app needs a popular function (remittances) and implement it cheaper but more importantly: safer, more convenient and easier accessible than the competition.
Effort required to safety is at the expense of convenience and accessibility. For Bitcoin to become a killer app, it must become harder to lose them, be it by theft or by losing private keys.
Using Bitcoin safely should be trivially easy. As it stands, and as yet another exchange hack of 120,000 BTC shows, Bitcoin has a lot left to improve in that area.

I am **not** proposing to introduce general reversibility of normal Bitcoin transactions.
I am in favor of an *additional* type of address being introduced with special properties such as the ability to reverse the transaction within a certain timeframe. Or some other properties that make theft improbable such as only allowing the coins to be sent to only two or three prespecified addresses and only with a delay.
So, a protocol level change a la multisig that is optional to use and which gives exchanges and large hodlers the ability to better secure their bitcoin.

Without ability to safely trade, Bitcoin cannot survive. In that sense, the Bitfinex hack where USD 70m vanishes is very bad for the credibility of Bitcoin.
Something's got to change. Right now, having Bitcoins at an exchange is playing russian roulette. That must be addressed at the protocol level. Leaving this vulnerability unaddressed will strengthen the call for regulation of exchanges and ultimately Bitcoin, which I am sure nobody wants.

Good question. I don't think it is healthy.
However I don't see blockchain assets taking off, as it reintroduces trust. Having the private key to an asset on the blockchain requires trust that:
* The asset actually exists
* The claim of ownership is legally enforceable 
* Ownership can be physically enforced
@_date: 2016-08-18 06:05:50
Don't be so surprised. Exchange hacks like Bitfinex give ample ammunition to regulators. Therefore it is crucial for the Bitcoin protocol to be enhanced such that it becomes impossible that a single hack makes tens of millions USD worth of Bitcoin be taken away in hours time.
The improvement should be such that Bitcoin are protected in a transparent way such that it can be verified that the protection is adequate.
Multisig was a big step forward, but it is clearly not enough.

There is no benefit at all for using a non-PoW blockchain data structure as some sort of security measure against tampering.
It offers no benefit over for instance using a shared set of mutations that define the state of a common ledger. This can be as simple as agreeing over a set of sql insert and update statements. When replayed, it would create a database which defines the state of the shared ledger.
A blockchain does not offer any additional resistance against tampering. For instance, a hacker may tamper with a banks' blockchain instance by making a change in a block in the past and recompute all blocks coming after it. Since there is no PoW, this is computationally feasible, this in contrast to Bitcoin where it is impossible to ever catch up with the main chain. If the bank is not aware of the hack, then the bank has no way of knowing whether its blockchain has been tampered with, or whether other banks are colluding to falsify transaction history.
In short, a blockchain offers no tamper resistance as it can be rewinded and recomputed with alternate values. A shared list of mutations works equally well.

Let's explore an attack vector. I can break into your system and steal your signature if it is stored online. That can be mitigated by storing the signature offline like Trezor does. However, for any reasonable volume, automated signing of transactions is required, so such a setup will not work in the use case of high volume transaction processing. The low volume high value transaction use case might be interesting though, using manual 4-eyes checking and authorization of transactions with a Trezor like device.
In case the signature is stored online however, the security depends on the systems not getting compromised. That offers no additional security over non-blockchain setups which are also save as long as the system is not compromised (from either in or outside).

Given the increasing number of cpu and memory operations as the blockchain grows, this issue might become more common.
Perhaps the software can be programmed to try a failed block multiple times? And to warn a user of possible memory issues if it fails once but succeeds the next time?
As an enhancement, a checksum of each block can be calculated. Calculating this has less chance of error given the miniscule number of ops compared to validating a block. If a block is first rejected and then accepted, then it must be a hardware issue.

They don't. But even if they had, money can't buy a solution to a problem that seems fundamental: a fully automated system authorizing transactions will be as save as the system itself. Once the system is compromised, all value it controls can be stolen.

Bitcoin is computationally intensive by design. This aspect of the design is not required for offering pseudo-anonymity.
For Bitcoin to work, it requires a majority vote to determine transaction ordering, i.e., the fundamental problem of deciding in which order the transactions should be accounted for.
For fair voting, a vote must not be spoofable. For instance, one vote per node or IP number is spoofable by someone simply spinning up many nodes from many different IP numbers.
Computing power is the only fundamentally un-spoofable resource. Therefore, miners essentially vote using their mining power to which block will be added to the chain and by that the final transaction ordering is decided.

But the spin here is “Bitcoin is successful because of low interest rates”, implying that if interest rates weren’t as low, better investment opportunities would exist that do not require risky investments *(sic)* such as Bitcoin, and Bitcoin wouldn’t be where it is now.
I don’t agree with the implied conclusion that Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset to most people. Or, in other words, seen by most some sort of get-rich-quick scheme.
Instead, many people that are into Bitcoin are acutely aware of the abnormal economic environment of having negative or near-zero interest rate policy (NIRP) for extended periods which is a first in history. Bubbles are being inflated right now as house prices and stock prices have become overvalued while government debt and consumer debt are steadily increasing.
Ofcourse, something will have to give. Either interest rates stay near zero and these bubbles become ever larger, or interest rates go up and these bubbles will pop.
Bitcoin is the best safe haven asset in existence due to its anonymity and the fact that it is difficult to track down and confiscate.
So yeah, low interest rates are related to the success of Bitcoin, but not for the reasons the author is implying.
I suppose we’ll see this spin more often.

Once mining is no longer centralized, spamming the blockchain will become uneconomical. A block-stuffing miner will earn less money per block because less space will be left for legitimate fee-paying transactions. This means spammers will have less money to expend for mining compared to competing non-spamming miners. The next block-halving will make this effect even stronger because fees will become a  bigger portion of miner income.
Spamming now only but incentives the search for off-chain solutions.

In a way, [Bitcoin is already better]( USD has historically inflated wealth away at a steady rate.


The applications created on top of “blockchain  technology” may be useful. I am just saying that using a blockchain is bad engineering. The same applications can be implemented without a blockchain way more efficiently.
A blockchain is a building block of Bitcoin that enables it to be trustless and decentralized. Any application that uses a blockchain but without a token having value is no longer decentralized and so also not trustless. At that point, traditional techniques are more efficient.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:34:05

Trust between entities can only be removed if there is an incentive to secure the information stored in the blockchain in such a way that it becomes immutable - or more precise: economically infeasible to mutate.
This requires an incentive to expend capital in order to secure the blockchain. That in turn requires a ~~monetary~~ economic reward from the system and hence a token having value (eg. for Bitcoin this is the at current 12.5 new bitcoin issued + the fees that sit in every newly mined block). The fact that bitcoin have value is the only reason that miners exist and the information in the blockchain is secure.


That’s rich. Which consultancy are you from?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:22


Because they aren’t if you look at the bigger picture.
High fees are likely caused by spam attacks, possibly from large miners or even a single miner spamming blocks full. Mining is in the hands of very few and thus the biggest miner will find the majority of the blocks and recoup the fees. They can therefore stuff blocks with their own transactions almost for free or even with a profit because they drive up the fees.
Miner centralization makes this feasible and is therefore the main problem.
However economic incentives are hard at work.
* Full blocks will accelerate adoption of segwit.
* Full blocks amplify the use cases of Lightning Networks.
* Mining is so profitable that it has catched the attention of parties that are now producing ASICs that are significantly more energy efficient than the latest of Bitmain. Their mining dominance is likely going to be ending soon.
High fees are problem, but one that will be solved. Not by bigger blocks because they will be stuffed just the same. No, it will be solved by proper engineering and true second-layer scaling.

LN is trustless just like Bitcoin. Merchants don’t need to trust anyone. They are free to close their channel and settle their transactions at any time and at their own discretion.


An exchange using LN can create an open channel with a trader and settle profit and losses in real-time. This is great for the trader as there will no longer be the risk that the exchange runs away with their funds. It is also great for the exchange because it can operate much more efficiently because there will be no need for an expensive bespoke heavily secured cold-warm-hot wallet infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:09

Perhaps it is useful to make a distinction between a miner (creating blocks) and a hasher (contributing hash power to a miner). (This difference between miner and hasher be may disappearing due to a BIP which lets hashers
decide which transactions make it into a block).


Incorrect. Only transactions inside blocks that make up the longest valid chain are considered to exist.
A chain with the most proof of work is not valid if the block at the tip is not valid, regardless of how much hash power went into it.

Without segwit, LN is possible but with limitations. Implementing LN without segwit requires significant additional development of a level and magnitude that is unavailable to BCH.
But rest assured, BCH will not need LN as they vow to increase block space in case blocks become full. Also, spam does not exist according to BCH philosophy because a transaction that ends up on-chain is never spam.

Jihan cq. Bitmain very likely mines more than half of the blocks so the chances are &gt; 50%.

Due to miner centralization, for large miners it sadly may likely be profitable to spam the blockchain with non-zero fee transactions.
A miner recoups the fees of a block they find. Since mining is centralized, the biggest miner can freely spam the blockchain because they can be sure to find most blocks and hence get back the fees.

I understand the sentiment but think of the bigger picture. At some point governments will see value in stocking up Bitcoin as a reserve. What do you think this will do to the price?

Decreasing volatility means increased utility and therefore value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:09:20


The size of blocks are limited for a critical reason: 
**Censorship resistance** by remaining sufficiently decentralized.
The number of nodes have been dropping constantly,  despite increased adoption, and this decline is a direct threat to the existence of Bitcoin. If the number of nodes will become too low, Bitcoin loses its decentralized properties, making it vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. Likely its value would plummet and it might even be end of story for Bitcoin.
Luckily blocks are currently far from filled, which gives us time some to come up with structural solutions to the scaling issue.

This ofcourse won’t end well. As soon as interest rates go up, bubbles start to pop. So the world is trapped in a dangerous, bubble inflating low interest rates situation. At some point rates must go up. It might well be flight into Bitcoin that causes this in a year or five. It won’t be pretty.

But that is fantastic! A  [document]( of the administrators of Hotwire, Mr. Wrights insolvent company, full of nuggets.
First, let's have a look at the income statement of Hotwire:


    Interest and other income                 112,864
    Coin-Exch Pty Ltd (progress payments)   3,994,500
Comments from the administrators (emphasis mine):




* Hotwire’s Directors (who we note also have an interest in Coin-Ex) have advised that *these amounts are not properly recoverable*, given the research and development work undertaken by Hotwire ceased before being finalised; and
* Accordingly, further investigations as to the recoverability of these amounts is required.
In other words, Hotwire is still waiting for a payment of AUD$ 4M from Coin-Ex, and it is not quite sure if that amount will ever be received!
Also, it seems Mr. Wright lost his money at Mt. Gox (emphasis mine):






* Dr Wright, as the major shareholder no longer being able to provide financial accommodation to the Company due to the collapse of **the Mount Gox Bitcoin registry where we understand Dr Wright had a significant exposure**.
Mr. Wrights company became insolvent shortly after the collapse of Mt. Gox:


We have formed this view because:


* wages for employees had not been paid since February 2014; and
* Pay as You Go Withholding Tax due to the ATO was not paid since February 2014.
The administrators go on to uncover that Hotwire is hot air (emphasis mine):


On Cloudcroft it says nothing about a supercomputer, instead the administrators were told something very differently (emphasis mine):


I propose we close the book on Mr. Wright and move on. But entertaining it has certainly been, never a dull day in bitcoinland!

Not sure what you mean. But if you mean to ask if it is useful to store ownership information in the blockchain then the answer is a resounding no.

It is *not* because Bitcoin enables making a payment. Because as you will also realize, that is already possible in a multitude of ways: using bank wire (SEPA plans to make wires instant), Paypal, numerous credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, debit cards, contactless debit card or soon your NFC-equipped cellphone which can act as a bank card, and so on and so on. Bitcoin will have a tough job to compete in that busy arena.
Luckily it doesn't have to. Payments are not at all what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin is about settlements, censorship resistance and cutting out the middleman (banks) that require trust. It is about being able to store a piece of your wealth completely save, without risk of a bank failure, debasement of the currency, or (if proper precautions are taken) theft and confiscation by the government. Being decentralized is crucial - if Bitcoin becomes centralized, it will be worthless as it offers no advantages over existing systems. It would be the sad end of the experiment.
Bigger blocks do not gain Bitcoin much, but it does risk losing everything.

Ofcourse, if the aggregate hash power of all 21inc devices grows faster relative to that of other pools, then the total reward available to 21inc devices will also grow.
However the reward *per 21inc device* would ofcourse decrease. If 1 million devices earn BTC 100 per day, and 2 million devices earn BTC 150, then the total reward for all 21inc devices has gone up, but the reward per device has decreased.

Any unbound dynamic limit runs the risk of growing so fast that nodes will drop out due to their bandwidth limitations. Also, it makes the size of a block completely unpredictable at any point in time.

Huh?? The article says absolutely nothing about the amount of memory the supercomputer is supposed to have.
In a [video]( Mr. Wright claimed his supercomputer is equipped with 770 of PB in memory. The price of DRAM was US$ 8 per GB in 2014. At US$ 8 million per PB, that would mean his supercomputer would have had a cost of over 6 billion US$ for the DRAM alone. That seems outlandish.

Don't quit your node, if your bandwidth is decent then it is a huge asset for Bitcoin.
I think there exists tools that let you monitor everything there is about your node and make it accessible through a web interface so you can also share it online.

And the title says *peer-to-peer* which is only possible if it is trustless. So being trustless is a key property.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:38:40


Bitcoin by any definition is a settlement system. A settlement is also a payment, but a settlement is way superior to a lowly payment. The ability to settle each payment peer-to-peer (so trustlessly without needing any third party) is *the* key property of Bitcoin. It is what makes Bitcoin censorship resistant.
Arguing to remove the distinction between payment and settlement discredits Bitcoin.
So no, I don't think it is fair.

It's exactly this that those in favor of a twentyfold max block size increase just don't seem to want to accept. Node count is dropping because running a full node is too expensive and has no perceived benefits.
I am very in favor of a cap increase, but not to 20 MB, since blocks of this size would currently wipe out so many nodes that Bitcoin will become dangerously centralized. So why support it? A moderate, predefined growth of the cap makes more sense IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:36:03


Traders exchange their local fiat currency into BTC because they believe it is a profitable trade.
If Greece defaults, the euro may take a hit. The uptick in price can therefore be caused by traders or ordinary people believing that they will be better off if at least some of their money is in BTC instead of in euro.

That's not what it is about. Have a look at the bandwidth a full node requires and multiply it by 20. You will see that your residential connection will not do. Especially the sustained upstream bandwidth requirements are way beyond what most residential connections are capable of offering today.

The 40% yearly cap increase would be hardcoded in the Core, so that miners need to upgrade only once. After that, no more hardforks.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:56:44
Do you think that there is a chance that block sizes increase to 20-30 MB in a year from now?
If not, then why support such large increase now? Wouldn't it make more sense to increase the cap gradually?
If you do, then don't you think such increase would cause a drop in the number of nodes that is severe enough to render Bitcoin basically centralized and vulnerable?
If not, then how do you conclude that sufficient nodes in the network will remain which are able to handle 20-30 times the current bandwidth of a full node?

Personally I think one transaction per day for every human including babies is a bit much - but let's do the math anyway:
7B transactions / day = 81k tps. Let's say that we can support 3 tps with 1 MB blocks. Then for 81k tps we'd require 26 GB blocks.
If bandwidth keeps increasing with 40% per year (a modest assumption as Nielsen's "law" sees a 50% yearly growth) then in 30 years from now, this can actually be supported just as easily as 1 MB blocks today.

Many things are not possible on the Blockchain already such as storing large amounts of data (such as a video) in a block.

I suppose you are referring to the Deposit Guarantee System which insures deposits up to EUR 100,000. This system was not really designed to deal with a complete collapse of all banks in a country.
In fact, what will happen is that first, ATMs stop working (likely to be a fact within hours from now). Then at some point the euro accounts are redenominated into drachme 2.0 accounts. These new drachmes will fully match the euro amount in the bank accounts according to the *governments* exchange rate. The *market* exchange rate will however tell depositors what really happened: they got screwed.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:53:18
Doubling every 2 years is about 40% per year. According to [Nielsen's "law"]( bandwidth capacity can increase 50% per year.
If 8 MB blocks will be feasible in January 2016, then growing 40% per year going forward must also be feasible since such rate of increase is below the expected rate at which bandwidth capacity increases (i.e., Nielsen's 50% per year).
Another way to look at this: the cap should be such that at any point in time, it cannot lead to undesirable levels of centralization, while at the same time the cap is such that it does not artificially limit growth by being lower than necessary. The cap should be such that when fully used, the level of centralization cannot reach unacceptable levels.

How disingenuous.
The Greek can't get their money out of the banks because it *is not there*. And if it wasn't for the 87 billion [emergency liquidity assistance]( the ATMs would have stopped working months ago.
It does not take a PhD in economics to see the bigger picture. Fractional reserve banking is gambling with other peoples money. The depositor money is lended and sure - normally repaid with interest. But a bank can make mistakes, for instance by lending too much to a particular sector - say automotive - and become insolvent if that particular sector is hit. The depositor money is gone unless there is a bailout which is ultimately fully paid by the taxpayer.
In case the economy as a whole goes south, banks will not cut it. Now what we have seen is that banks get bailed out. To finance this, trillions are created from thin air. Everyone pays a price for this money creation by inflation.
Bitcoin cannot be inflated.

I don't think this is what the world is waiting for. Coffees can be paid in many ways effortlessly and bitcoin offers zero advantage in that respect.
On the contrary, the blockchain would grow to an unwieldly size and censorship resistance would be put at stake, just to enable something that can already be done by many other payment systems.
Being able to pay for a coffee with bitcoin would be cool, but not if it is going to be settled on-chain. It will be possible in the future with Lightning Network or other off-chain techniques, transparently to the payer.

The Cyprus capital controls and subsequent confiscations of depositors money in march 2013 coincided with BTC rising from USD 40 to USD 230 in a matter of days.
Even though the current price increase seems more modest, it can no longer be denied that again in the same situation the BTC price is rising and it is now reasonable to assume that this rise is a direct response to capital controls and banks closing - this time in Greece.
Bitcoin is and has since Cyprus apparently been regarded as a hedge against instability of fiat. Not necessarily by the Cypriots and Greek themselves, but by concerned fiat holders all over the world, who chose to convert at least some of their fiat into BTC, so to protect their wealth from being confiscated by their own government.
Having some wealth in BTC offers - besides hefty price fluctuations - also the piece of mind that in times of economic turbulence and banks faltering, BTC will always be accessible and is likely to increase in value as well.

My proposal would mean a fivethousandfold increase in capacity in 20 years compared to today. An increase which ultimately allows for 15,000 transactions per second, which is more than VISA. I doubt that we would ever reach these volumes on the blockchain but Bitcoin will be able to support it 20 years from now as long as the 40% yearly bandwidth growth is feasible for the next 20 years.
So the standard this sets is quite ambitious. More importantly, and I think this is the point you might have missed, this 40% yearly growth is the maximum of what is technically possible. If growth would be faster, centralisation would reach unhealthy levels. If growth outpaces bandwidth costs, the number of nodes can be expected to drop even faster than it does today, eventually to dangerously low levels. Already the number of nodes has been dropping to only a few thousands.
In other words, faster growth simply is not possible without putting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin at risk. Intermediate solutions such as sidechains or lighthouse can be used to scale up in the mean time. But as technology progresses and bandwidth keeps growing, these solutions at some point will no longer be required to support more tps because all transactions can be on blockchain again.

Well, yes and no.
I find it somewhat uneasy when calling for promoting Bitcoin as a savior in front of people that are insecure and can lose their savings imminently such as the Greek.
Even though it may be well intended, the price swings of Bitcoin and the risk of losing them are probably unwelcome additional worries to people who need to plan on how to get through the week and arrange meals and bare necessities for their families. I wouldn't want to encourage them to speculate in Bitcoin with the little money that they may have left and will sorely need to survive.
On the other hand, I'd advice anyone having savings in fiat to convert some of it to BTC. Just as a hedge against what may be interesting times ahead. Especially people in Italy, Spain and Portugal, which will be in the crosshairs next in case Greece defaults. Don't enable banks to confiscate all your savings!

One short term issue I see is that currently the difficulty is rising so quickly that the buying power of the built-in mining chip deteriorates very fast.
The growth in hashes per second per Watt will however slow down as mining chips mature so this problem will become less pressing. However it will not disappear completely.
An option might be to make the mining chip a replacable module so it can be updated independently of the host hardware.

Non-bitcoin transactions should at least make themselves known, so that miners can deal with them selectively. Higher fees for instance.
But frankly I don't know how these transactions are defendable. They can lower the value proposition of Bitcoin by pushing up the price per transaction once blocks become full and a fee market is established. On the flipside, they add nothing of value to the currency itself.

A very well thought out and well worded piece of Adam, definitely worth reading in its entirety.
I think the issues Adam raises are significant and do not reflect well on Mike Hearn. Adam explains convincingly why it is very dangerous that Mike is trying to circumvent the consensus model by pushing for a hard fork unilaterally. Also Adam points out that Mike is lobbying his change with Bitcoin companies that cannot be expected to understand the intricacies of Bitcoin well enough to judge Mike's proposals on its technical merits. This is what the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process is for, which allows for an out in the open discussion on technical merits.
Mike claims that there is a risk of a "mass exodus" and that there are developers opposing to scale Bitcoin. Adam points out that this is a mischaracterisation. Every single person on the mailing list is in favor of scaling Bitcoin.
Furthermore, Adam notes that Mike has not contributed much to Bitcoin Core. I myself would like to add that Mike has a record of coming up with very questionable or even downright dangerous ideas that spark controversy. This seems yet another one to add to the list.

If the decline of the number of full nodes is indeed a usability issue, then the solution seems straightforward. The declining node issue can then be solved by increasing the usability of a full-node wallet and make it as easy to use as an SPV wallet. For instance, by switching to SPV mode during the download of the blockchain.
However, I am still sceptical - I don't believe the declining number of nodes is just a usability issue. I believe bandwidth and to a lesser extend disk usage do play a role, especially for people storing just a small amount worth of bitcoin. Why would anyone storing a sub-$100 amount invest in a full node? After all, running a full node might be cheap but it is certainly not free.

This is not a logical conclusion. The node count did not drop because new users went for an SPV client. A *drop* in node count means that *existing* users of Bitcoin-QT were switching to an SPV wallet.
What was their motivation? They already had downloaded the full blockchain. They were already accustomed to Bitcoin-QT. Why did they still go through the trouble to switch?
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:24:10


Bitcoin-QT was ditched in favor of SPV and web-based wallets. The large blockchain causes Bitcoin-QT to take 20-30 minutes to catch up for casual users each time they launch it, during which time their connection is hogged and their computer is basically unusable for anything else.
The drop in the number of full nodes therefore is a direct consequence of the rate the blockchain is currently growing. That rate in turn is capped by the max block size. Increasing this cap twentyfold is dangerous since if such increase would actually occur then this would absolutely massacre the number of nodes and render Bitcoin effectively centralized.

That’s incorrect.
Changing the hashing algorithm has been suggested as a nuclear option in case Bitmain were to decide to 51% attack Bitcoin.
In case of such an attack which is an existential threat to Bitcoin, changing the hashing algorithm is absolutely the last resort.
Otherwise, it does not make sense. A new hashing algorithm would play in the hands of Bitmain because they already have money, engineers and production capacity to be first-to-market with the new ASICs.
The SHA256 algorithm is well understood and presumably highly optimized, which creates a more level playing field for ASIC manufacturers. A new algorithm is going to have many optimizations left to be discovered, and Bitmain would definitely find them first given their engineering power.

That is complete nonsense, and it is very easy to see why.
A miner that finds a new block that extends the chain has then created the chain having “the most work put into it”.
Ofcourse, not just any random block would do or else miners would be able do funny things like for instance inflating the maximum number of Bitcoin in circulation by handing themselves a 100 BTC reward per block.
Miners do not have such powers, because nodes would reject such blocks. A block can only extend the chain if it is in accordance with the Bitcoin consensus rules. In other words, the block must also be _valid_.
If the chain has an invalid block at the tip, then this block is not considered by nodes and discarded as if it never existed. As a result, other miners would also ignore such invalid block and not mine any block on top of it.

Actually it does, and this is crucial to understand why a blocksize increase wouldn’t have made any difference.
Although there wasn’t a smoking gun, there was strong suspicion that BitMain and possibly other miners were spamming to:
* Game inadequate fee estimating algorithms used by wallets to overpay;
* Sabotage segwit and push for a blocksize increase instead in order to preserve their covert AsicBoost advantage — EDIT: [evidence](
Segwit had tremendous support. The Bitcoin community, much of the ecosystem and all of the Core developers were in favor of segwit. Yet, activation was stalled for months as 70% of all mining power refused to signal for segwit activation. This showed that mining was heavily centralized.
And when 70% of mining power is in the hands of defacto a single party, spamming becomes very profitable. After all, the fees paid for the spam transaction are recouped by the miner itself in 7 out of 10 blocks. This translates to a 70% discount on transaction fees for the spammer. Since spam drove up fees, the spamming miner would more than likely come out ahead.
The key is that bigger blocks wouldn’t have made any difference. Spamming would still have been profitable but the damage would be much greater.
A moderate blocksize helps to prevent abuse from taking up too much resources and also incentifies second layer solutions, which are a true scaling solution, unlike increasing blocksize.

Bitcoin can handle about half a million transactions daily. Keep in mind that each Bitcoin transaction is a irreversible and final settlement. Once processed, the coin are fully under your control.
This is ofcourse unlike traditional bank transactions which can be reversed and worse, accounts can be frozen. Access to your own money is at the mercy of the bank and the government of the country it is in.
A Bitcoin transaction cannot be compared to a traditional bank transaction. They are fundamentally different. The powerful features of a Bitcoin transaction are achievable because the Bitcoin ledger has many copies that are forced to be in sync. No single person or group can tamper with the Bitcoin ledger.
This works as long as Bitcoin keeps many copies of its ledger, which makes it decentralized and therefore trustless. All the value of Bitcoin comes from it being trustless. If Bitcoin weren’t, it wouldn’t have any value. It simply cannot compete with traditional centralized systems that only need a single copy of their ledger.
Second layer solutions such as Lightning Network will offer off-chain scaling without compromising the decentralized properties of Bitcoin and thus without jeopardizing the one thing that gives it value: being trustless.

The Bitcoin protocol has no provisions to record ownership of assets. It is hacked into Bitcoin by repurposing technical fields in a way which claims space on the Blockchain used to store information about assets.
This really has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Assets can be stored using transactions of trivial value, which will do nothing for the BTC exchange rate. The Blockchain will however grow and the transaction capacity will shrink by this non-Bitcoin application which parasitically bloats the Blockchain at a net loss for eveyone holding Bitcoin.
The proper way would be to write a BIP featuring a design to integrate assets into the Blockchain properly.

Merchants *will* fan consumer adoption.
An item bought using bitcoin instead of a creditcard saves a merchant up to 3%. That is a lot of margin, especially for products that have low margins. For instance, if a merchant sells products with a 10% margin, reducing payment processing cost with 2% increases the margin to 12%. That is 20% more pure profit. 
I therefore expect merchants to start offering incentives to consumers to pay with bitcoin, and also to make the "pay with bitcoin" option prominently visible.

That’s not true. Due to size hardly anyone replays all transactions from genesisto verify the current state. This introduces trust: you have to trust a third party that they are not lying when they tell you the state of the ledger at some forward point in time.
With Bitcoin, anyone can verify the entire blockchain from genesis without needing excessive time or bandwidth. That is as a direct result of keeping a modest block size.


It is a fundamental trade-off. Higher transaction throughput increases bandwidth requirements and is therefore a centralization pressure.
(That’s assuming bandwidth is utilized with 100% efficiency, which it is not yet. Signature aggregation will increase transaction throughput another 20-25% without increasing bandwidth demands.)

This is fundamentally very, very wrong. The bitcoin protocol should only be concerned in transferring bitcoin from one address to another. Incorporating real-world concepts such as memos, receipts and refunds in the protocol adds no benefits to the original key goals of bitcoin: anonymous, tamper free, government resilient storage and transfer of value.
If needed, any extra functionality can be *and therefore must be* created outside the protocol.
Here's why:
o Adding logic into the core protocol of bitcoin adds complexity. This can be justified by making bitcoin safer, but not by adding usability features that can be implemented outside the protocol. Adding complexity is bad because it will become harder for new developers to join and add to bitcoin, as well as it will become harder to verify whether the code is safe and secure, contains no bugs or backdoors.
o Adding logic to the core adds attack vectors. For malicious users, who will attempt to exploit any new features. For governments, who will look for, and find additional reasons to oppose and delegitimitize bitcoin. For hackers, who will look for bugs and exploit them.
Bitcoin should be as light as possible and stick to its core functions. These are world changing. Adding relatively frivolous features like this straight into the protocol is a horrible idea.

Your assumption about Counterparty is completely wrong. It is not NASDAQ. For instance, the speed in which can be traded is limited by the speed in which new blocks are created, i.e., too slow for many classes of trading.
That said, it holds promise for trading where speed is not so relevant.
EDIT: and to answer the question:
The Counterparty protocol must not depend on the unintended use of a feature in the bitcoin protocol. If this becomes a trend with other altcoins as well, bitcoin becomes either unmanageable or altcoins get broken as soon as changes occur in that one feature they depend on.

Yet here comes a unscrupulous Newsweek reporter honoring him with a visit, with the only goal of concocting a story as if he's the inventor of bitcoin, hoping to sell a few more copies of their print-edition relaunch. Satoshi Nakamoto feels the need to break years of silence in an attempt to alleviate this man from more anxiety. That's when everyone can know how wrong it is what Newsweek did. Thanks Andreas, for doing the right thing in a responsible way.

Thanks for your answer Greg. I am somewhat concerned seeing the top contributors to Bitcoin become more commercially driven. I observe that the incentives between Bitcoin and Blockstream are not fully aligned, which you seem to confirm. I am worried that a vacuum may be created where Bitcoin development slows down significantly in favor of Blockstream. Ofcourse there are many contributors to Bitcoin, but as you yourself point out - only very few work on the core, and Pieter is contributing more than numbers 2 and 3 combined. I wonder who have the skills to continue the development of Bitcoin at the level of the Blockstream team, or can be vigilant that the now commercially motivated Blockstream developers keep acting purely in the interest of Bitcoin when contributing to the Core, and don't focus development purely on sidechain technology and ignore other ideas.
In addition to that, the business model of Blockstream is not clear. That is either deliberate or because you simply don't know yet how to commercially exploit sidechains. However, $15M says that a plan is present on how to commercialize sidechains that you do not want to share yet, possibly to protect your investors interests.
My two cents - I guess we have to wait and see.

At least, a *citation needed* should be added to these claims.
But really, that line should be removed. The number of legit merchants offering payment in bitcoin has exploded in recent months, and the number of transactions are at record levels. It is therefore fair to assume that illicit purchases have been reduced significantly relative to legit bitcoin purchases.
The dollar, euro, pound, yen... in fact any currency in the world is used as well for illicit purchases. Is that mentioned in their wiki pages?

It's not a stretch to regard Counterparty as a side chain with a one-way peg.
Proof-of-burn removed the btc from the bitcoin blockchain and inserted it into the counterparty blockchain. However the reverse is impossible - unlike sidechains, counterparty coin can not re-enter the bitcoin blockchain.
That, however, ensures the value of counterparty is not pegged to bitcoin.

Yes I mean mining centralisation. It's unhealthy. I don't think PoS is a good solution. I believe PoW &amp; SHA2 is fundamentally sound. For instance, botnets taking over PCs or other consumer hardware is hardly profitable anymore due to the hashing power of ASICs. That's a great thing.
I do believe that the block reward should be divided in more pieces so that more workers get a reward &amp; vote in what makes it into the block chain. Currently it's winner takes all, creating the incentive for workers to join the largest mining pool.

Nice piece.
Towards the end, Vitalik talks about ASIC-resistant algorithms. By making the hashing algorithm adaptable, the only economically viable solution to keep up with the changes would be a general purpose CPU, and that would end the ASIC era.
But would that also solve the centralization issue? I suppose people would mine in pools just the same, because of the variance. Also, I'd predict that datacenters having access to cheap electricity and/or an economic purpose for the generated heat would have a considerable cost advantage compared to home miners. In other words, if today all ASICs would be obsoleted and the CPU were the only way to mine, pools would continue to exist (to battle variance) and centralization can still not be avoided (economics of scale).

Depending on its implementation, a fiat blockchain can inherit some of the properties from the bitcoin blockchain:
 - Cheap and convenient payments, also cross-border;
 - Settlement of payments within max one hour;
 - Pseudonimity;
 - Difficult to trace;
 - Balance total is protected by cryptography;
 - Impossible for authorities to freeze a single account.
Of course, some Bitcoin advantages are not copied, such as:
 - Predictable and moderate inflation of the amount of currency units;
 - Currency units are themselves valuable, whereas fiat currency units are a proxy for fiat, and must be backed by fiat to retain their value;
 - Trustless, whereas a fiat blockchain requires some level of trust in fiat bankers.

Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization over transaction throughput.
And throughput has improved dramatically — the current levels wouldn’t be possible with the older software. Older versions would struggle to keep up verifying signatures and syncing would take months and the number of people willing to run a node would be way less.


It is not a weakness. It is a direct result of being decentralized which poses fundamental limitations to transaction throughput. More throughput means lower node count, basically, due to the increased levels of bandwidth and computing resources required.


The jury is still out on that. LN has the potential to increase throughput by orders of magnitudes. A doubling of the blocksize is only a doubling in capacity at the expense of decentralization.
Bitcoin derives its value entirely from the fact that it is decentralized. For transaction processing there are tons of other cheap options that Bitcoin will never be able to compete with since thousands of nodes have to store every single transaction on-chain for eternity.
LN changes the game, and off-chain transaction processing is the only way to mass-adoption. On-chain scaling is a dead-end.

Price discovery would work better if transaction fees were more dynamic. Suppose I do a transaction, and I'm not in a hurry. I'd like to be able to specify the following:
- First, try to get in a block with some low fee A. Try it X times.
- If after X times, the transaction is still not incuded in a block, pay up the market rate B.
I can do the transaction without worrying it gets stuck, and specify beforehand how hard I want to try to get it through on the cheap. In a more advanced version, I'd be able to specify how many times I want to try for fee B, before moving on to the market rate C. So, I could say: try once for A, try the second and third time for the still low B, only then go for the market rate C.
Perhaps, to make it even more dynamic, the block could allocate more fee levels in which transactions can be included, and / or make them more dynamic as well.

Sadly this was predictable and doesn't come as a surprise.
There will not be a single government of a high-tax country that will ever be conductive Bitcoin. Nice words will be spoken, but ultimately Bitcoin will be regulated enough to prevent any business from accepting it.
I wonder what these proposed regulations will mean for businesses in the US that accept bitcoin. Are they going to have to exclude NY customers? How? I guess bitcoin payment processors will have to hire lawyers and adapt their IT systems to comply, and these costs will add to the cost of accepting bitcoin.
Other businesses might be put off by the regulatory tsunami that is building up. The announced NY regulation might very well stop merchant adoption in its tracks. Not only in NY but everywhere in the US *and* outside the US.
If that happens, Bitcoin will simmer underground for perhaps years in a legal gray area. Adoption will initially stall, the price of a bitcoin may fall dramatically, even to sub USD 100 levels. But although the upcoming regulations likely sabotages its use as a means of consumer to US-based business payments, its function of as a long-term store of value is not affected. In other words, hodlers are not affected.
I predict that Bitcoin will face a few difficult years where governments of high-tax countries will fight it. But the dynamics are in favor of Bitcoin.
Highly indebted governments are forced to either continue to raise taxes to unreasonable levels and/or inflate away debt by printing money. Both will make Bitcoin rebound spectacularly. Even if not a single good can be purchased directly with bitcoin, as long as a functioning exchange between fiat and bitcoin exists, it will be a safe haven for people who see their savings melt and/or their income increasingly fall into the hands of their government.
Another dynamic is the low-tax jurisdictions for instance in Asia that might very well embrace bitcoin and attract low margin / high volume businesses. Some businesses might incorporate in a bitcoin friendly jurisdiction to gain a crucial competitive advantage over for instance US based businesses that are stuck with expensive payment processors and have to deal with fraudulent chargebacks, but can't use Bitcoin due to regulatory restraints.
All in all, tough but interesting times ahead.

Because it increases their margin. By a lot, too.
Every time you pay with your credit card, 3% of the sales price goes to the credit card company.

Please check the fees charged by your bank for your credit and debit card. How much do you pay per year? Genuinly interested to know.
Also verify the interest you pay on debt on your credit and debit card, and how much it is above LIBOR.
Banking does not come for free.
I forgot the most expensive cost, which is in the prices of goods and services. Because the bank fees paid by merchants are ultimately paid by you, the consumer. You don't see them, because merchants are not allowed to charge higher amounts if someone wants to pay by credit card. Instead, all consumers pay a higher price, even those that do not pay by credit card.

I enjoy coding, and I think I’ll be most effective as Chief Scientist if I don’t lose touch with engineering reality and make the mistake of building huge, beautiful, theoretical castles that exist only as whitepapers.

Housing is expensive because it is used as a hedge against inflation.
The perverse consequence of this is that a house is often bought as a speculative investment, which drives up the price and has caused house price bubbles. When a bubble pops, it has the potential to bring down banks *en masse* and hence put the entire global debt-based financial system at risk.

It's not just gambling.
In any derivatives market, there are exactly three types of traders:
Hedgers: they utilize derivatives to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of an underlying. For instance, with a swap, a hedger can lock in a fixed price for oil going forward. Would the price of oil go up, then the swap would compensate for it. However, if the price goes down, the hedger would not be able to benefit from this as the swap will demand a payment offsetting the lower ool price. For Bitcoin, imagine a swap that locks in a price in dollars per bitcoin for a certain time period.
Speculators: they speculate on price changes of an underlying. They enter into for instance swap contracts with hedgers. In the oil swap example above, the speculator thinks the oil price will go down.
Arbitrageurs: they make money by trading on incorrect valuations of a derivative or underlying. They buy undervalued derivatives while simultaneously selling the overpriced, equivalent derivatives, and pocket the difference, risk free.

This is security through obscurity. Once the hacker knows how you construct the hash of your brainwallet, you are only protected by your passphrases. You have to store your algorithm somewhere, which makes it possible for a hacker to discover it.
But your solution hints at another idea. Another approach to make your passphrase more secure is by making it more expensive to brute-force it. It could look like this:
Take a relatively simple passphrase: "correct horse battery staple", only 44 bits of entropy, but that's still a 17,6 trillion keyspace. Use an expensive computation which takes 3 seconds to compute a hash, for instance by scrypting it millions of times. Use that hash to create your brainwallet.
An attacker is now limited to 1200 guesses per hour on hardware of the same speed. Let's be generous and say the hacker can scrypt 100 x faster. He can guess 2,9 million passwords per day. Let's say the hacker is very lucky and will find your passphrase after searching only 1/100th of the keyspace. That would still take him 167 years.
Of course, when hardware becomes faster, or when ASIC scrypt machines are entering the market, replace scrypt by something else and / or increase the number of times you hash the passphrase.
TL;DR: Passphrases can be made more secure by making it more expensive to search through the keyspace, allowing for shorter, lower entropy passphrases.

The size of a single block would be very big, but only few blocks are required.

In my opinion mining centralization is the largest protocol related weakness currently, because it gives a single entity so much power that Bitcoin is in fact no longer decentralised. According to me this can only really be addressed at the protocol level.
The issue is that only small changes are feasible. If a change is too big, its effects might not be predictable, possibly resulting in a protocol weakness.
Then there is the political issue as the stakes are high and companies that rely on the Bitcoin infrastructure may start pushing their own agendas in an attempt to get a competitive advantage. Such changes might not always be beneficial for the Bitcoin community at large, but may slip in somehow, for instance if a developer is funded by such company. It is hard to keep the incentives straight.
(Come to think of it, I would have no issue at all in a small extra amount on every bitcoin transaction that goes directly to a fund from which devs are compensated. Just to keep them more independent.)

The purportedly stable 2% inflation comes at a cost of destabilizing other economic factors. To maintain a stable inflation the USA now has an unpredictable interest rate policy (based on employment figures - completely arbitrary and impossible to predict long-term) and the use of unprecedented tools such as QE. That in turn causes exchange rate volatility and has a direct effect on consumption. Good luck planning for that.
Businesses don't just plan for "2% inflation", but also for interest rates, consumer confidence, rate of consumption, cost of materials, currency exchange rates, etc etc. stabilizing inflation means manipulation of interest rates and with that currency exhange rates. Which in turn affects basically the entire economy.

Isn't there a way to use the bitcoin mining power for sidechains?
That would require some way of sidechains submitting transactions to the bitcoin miners. In such a model, bitcoin mining would be transformed into a service that could be used by any blockchain.
In short it would decouple the miners from a specific blockchain. All transactions of all chains would be mined simultaneously, while  still honoring the technical differences between chains such as time between blocks and block size. A mined sidechain transaction would have its fee subtracted - it re-appears as btc and the miner receives it as normal.

It is possible to create a transaction which is processed at a predefined date and time in the future.
By creating a set of such transactions and sending them to the payee, a recurring payment is effectively created.
For instance, today you could create transactions like this:
 send 25,000 bits from 1MyAddress to 1Payee. This transaction can not be processed before july 1, 2014.
 send 25,000 bits from 1MyAddress to 1Payee. This transaction can not be processed before august 1, 2014.
... Etc.
After sending these transactions to the payee, it is the responsibility of the payee to submit these transactions timely. If submitted too early, they will not be processed. I'm not sure what happens if such transaction is submitted later, but I think in that case the transaction will be processed immediately.
The nice thing is that you can stop the recurring payments any time by emptying your address.
A drawback is that the payment is a fixed btc amount, and as a consequence the fiat amount varies due to changes in the exchange rate.

You misunderstand the idea. There are two things. 1. Your bitcoin wallet and addresses which are unaffected and as private as ever; 2. the registration and verification to obtain a bitcoin atm card (or QR code).
This enables the bitcoin atm to comply to regulations easily as palm &amp; passport scanners are not needed. Makes the atm cheaper to build. Also, it allows for a much better user experience because waiting for confirmations when exchanging btc for fiat can be skipped for small amounts. The atm simply invalidates your atm card if you double spend, forcing you to re-register. Or charge a small amount for the issuance of the card as a disincentive to double spend.
The atm card is kind of like a license which allows you to exchange fiat for btc, as per onerous US regulations in the name of thwarting money laundering and terrorism (sic).

Lawsky seeks dialog with the bitcoin community because he has to brinkwalk with regards to the amount of regulation. Too much regulation and bitcoin businesses will move off-shore where it is completely out of regulatory reach, too little regulation and he fears consumers will get duped and too much "illicit activities" will be facilitated (such as Silk Road). He highlights this key point at the very end of the video where he takes a question of a guy from the FDIC.
But whatever regulation is imposed will be irrelevant for cryptocurrencies in the long run. For instance, Lawsky is looking to regulate exchanges but it's pointless as trading will become largely trustless and decentralized within perhaps a year or two. 
Bitcoin is designed to resist governmental meddling. Regulation will proof to be an ineffective method to force bitcoin into the regulatory mold of traditional assets. It will just become more decentralized and anonymous as a result.

Design the incentives such that mining centralization does not occur.
A solo miner must be able to get a reward for mining that is proportional to his mining power and is paid out no less frequently than weekly.
A solo miner must also have a vote in which transactions are acceptable in a block.
This points to a solution where there are multiple PoWs in a block, so that more entities can get rewarded.
However, making big protocol changes while proving that no weakness is introduced is very hard.

Of course the arbitrator can be fooled once or even a couple of times. But that doesn't mean the system can't function.
SketchyBusiness that scams will receive a lot of angry complaints from customers and an arbitrator will either raise the prices for its services or stop doing business with them. No need at all for a proof on a case by case basis. An above average complaint rate will cause higher charges for the services of an arbitrator, so there is an incentive for every business to be honest and be able to somehow proof it.
The business that is expelled by arbitrators will in the end only be able to do business with ExpensiveDictatorlikeArbitrator.
People cheat insurances all the time. People steal from shops all the time. It is simply factored into the prices. At the same time, people are incentified to be honest because claiming damages will see their insurance premium rise, and can eventually lead to be refused as a customer.
I maintain - it is the optimal solution.

The changes needed to the protocol in order to keep it healthy or even alive, cannot be predicted in advance. An aspect of the protocol that has to be changed may happen to be crucial for SmartypantsCoin 
Now either the devs have to consider all unintended uses of the protocol with every change they make so they don't break anything, or simply disregard all SmartypantsCoins and consider the health of bitcoin proper exclusively.
To me the latter makes the most sense. I don't see how it can be justified that bitcoin devs must consider the technicalities of some FringeCoin if they want to improve bitcoin. Neither do I think it would be just that the bandwidth and memory that is contributed by the bitcoin community to make the protocol work are increased to make some FringeCoin work as well, that only a few people use.
It is just such a flawed concept in more ways than one.

Audits do not make companies any safer. An audit just produces a pile of paper to appease regulators and fool stakeholders into thinking everything is fine. The auditing scandals are numerous. It is just not good enough.
Regulators should realize that the bitcoin community is taking baby steps and learning from their mistakes. The community is aware of the weaknesses and is actively looking at better ways to become more safe.
For instance, the blockchain can do much more than prove coins are present. Using multisignature, the 4-eyes principle can be enforced, which is better than some proprietary 4-eyes procedure because it eliminates risk of a botched implementation which can be bypassed. Using time-locking, it can be enforced that coins can not disappear overnight. An exchange holding 400,000 coins could safely time-lock 300,000 of them for a month, and smaller amounts for shorter time periods.
The enforcement of such measures is verifyable by everybody by looking at the blockchain, which is infinitely better than internal procedures that can not be constantly monitored and might only be followed up fully when the auditors are present, but laxed as soon as they walk out the door.

Bitcoin is not like Linux. The Linux development model cannot be applied 1:1 to Bitcoin.
The Linux kernel is a collection of thousands of pieces of software that can freely be mixed and forked. Bitcoin Core is a monolithic piece of software that can not really be forked. This is a key difference and one that should be carefully considered.
For instance, in the Linux world advancements often happen when new developments are adopted and people start using them. A little hack of the kernel may start out being used by a small group in some niche but may end up in the mainline kernel if perfected and proven useful for many others as well.
A hack in the Bitcoin Core that changes the protocol must be adopted by everyone. There is no gradual path to adoption. Everyone must agree to use it. Unlike Linux, the kernel can't be forked to try out new things or to dismiss some unwanted changes. Everyone is using the same Core and there is no escape to changes in it.
That means changes need consensus from the community. So far this went smooth, but what happens if there is a change proposed which divides the community?

Ok, fair point. But to rebut:
Peter Todd has intimate knowledge of Bitcoin - although he claims it is easy, I would argue that not many people will be able to pull it off, not even with a dedicated tool.
But granted, enough are able to do it for it to potentially become an issue. Yet it isn't - and the reason is likely that it simply doesn't pay off to attempt a double spend. So although technically it is possible for some to pull it off, profiting from it apparently isn't so easy.

All of these bear risk. An increasing risk, given the rocketing government US debt.
Bitcoin is *designed* to do away with dependency on government policies or actions for the storage of wealth. Currently, in the early phases of bitcoin, the US government has a huge influence on its price. However, as bitcoin will prove resilient against governmental interference, it will prove its stability and with that preserve and increase its value.
I'll give you that volatility (mostly, by the way, caused by government interference) will be inevitable for the coming years. However, generally, the value and adoption of bitcoin will increase as the trust in it will increase day by day as people discover that bitcoin can not be contained by any government. This trust will be enforced in case significant inflation starts to evaporate peoples savings and pensions. And given the US rocketing debt, this is not that far-fetched.

Paypal is a company with a 68 billion market cap and 13,000 employees that has built an entire payment processing infrastructure. Sure, they may be able to offer a ChangeTip like service on top of that.
It is however very exciting that a small company like ChangeTip can leverage Bitcoin for the payment processing and use it in such an innovative way. It shows the power of Bitcoin which is offering full blown payment processing infrastructure almost for free.
What's new is that a small company with creative ideas is able to meaningfully innovate on top of a payment processing infrastructure that is open to everyone.

Enabling rolling back bitcoin transactions would mean that payments are never final. A merchant can never be certain that his payment won't be rolled back because he happened to be paid with stolen bitcoin. Adoption would greatly suffer from this - and it might very well be the beginning of the end.
It opens an entire can of worms. How can you prove a transaction was done without consent of the owner of the private key? The owner might be lying that he didn't give permission for some transaction and claim his private key was stolen, when in fact he did the transaction himself. How do you resolve such a dispute? It will take time. In the mean time, the bitcoin will propagate. If it turns out that these coins were indeed stolen, all these transactions would need to be reversed, impacting people that accepted bitcoin in good faith and play no part in the dispute. And who will give the verdict? Some central authority? Law enforcement?
Now, of course the next step would be to allow bitcoins to be frozen if one party claims the coins were stolen, until the dispute is resolved. This would be very bad - the protocol now supports that bitcoin in your wallet can suddenly be frozen, just like a bank account. The next step is regulation and the ability for law enforcement to freeze anyone's bitcoin because they are linked with "criminal activities". Congratulations, bitcoin is now dead.
I would suggest Mike Hearn starts an altcoin or sidechain which allows rolling back transactions and see how that works out.

As I understand it, the sidechain would not be holding litecoins, zerocoins or namecoins at all. It would hold bitcoins, but having an alternate implementation of the blockchain. The two-way peg ensures this.
One interesting use could be the implementations of derivatives such as CFDs where the total number of bitcoins between two trading parties is constant for any contract.
EDIT another great use case would perhaps be alternate transaction mechanisms such as support for high speed, low amount, lower security transfers for instance. That would alleviate the bitcoin blockchain. Also, I suppose that once all coins on the side chain are back on the bitcoin chain, the sidechain can be purged.
Makes me think - who keeps side chain alive? What's the incentive?

I think they will take it up with the Core devs indeed, and ask them to block your transactions instead.
Sadly miners have no incentive to stop your transactions as they get the transaction fees. Nodes, while crucial for the functioning of the network, are powerless and have no control of what ends up in the blockchain.
Sure, some nodes can refuse your transactions, but your transactions will end up in the blockchain as long as there are enough nodes ensuring your transactions make it to the miners.
It seems that the incentives are not entirely properly defined.

Adoption is not stalling. It is a slow process and bitcoin is very young. Currently, although bitcoin already economic merit for a small number of use cases, most people still find little reason to use it.
However both the number of uses of bitcoin is increasing as is the number of people discovering bitcoin. Time will do the rest.

Regulation will inevitably slow down the adoption of bitcoin. For instance, any regulation that is costly or even cost prohibitive for businesses to comply with will do a great job of killing off its use as a means of a payment system *in the US*. However, this would hand the US a competitive disadvantage since the cost savings can be significant, encouraging especially low-margin businesses to move to a more bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction.

In our example we're talking about a hypothetical 20% deflationary economy. That changes accounting a bit. A mortgage with a constant value *decreases* nominally. But that can be catered for in the contract, which can be negotiated in terms of value, instead of in terms of nominal amounts.

Floating fees are nice, but perhaps even better is having an option in the client to start with a low fee and gradually increase the fee until the transaction gets accepted.
This allows people who are looking for a cheap transaction to start with a low fee, in the hope it gets accepted, and if not, the fee is slightly increased in the next block, until the transaction gets accepted.

To me it seems that security can really be achieved in only one way: by leveraging current mining power using some form of merged mining.
For instance, extend the protocol to enable rewarding miners for finding a custom PoW specifically pertaining to a sidechain.
Miners should be able to merge-mine any sidechain PoW. The difficulty of the PoW should be a parameter. When a PoW is found, the miner can be rewarded by converting some sidechain-coin back to bitcoin, so the miner gets rewarded in bitcoin.
Technically, I imagine adding a special sidechain-to-bitcoin transaction in both the sidechain and the Bitcoin blockchain that holds all the rewards of solving a sidechain block. This special transaction that rewards a miner for finding a sidechain PoW would be present in both the Bitcoin blockchain and the sidechain blockchain, linking and securing both chains.
A sidechain may create blocks at a faster pace than Bitcoin because the difficulty is a parameter and can be set lower. A sidecoin-to-bitcoin reward transaction should be inserted to the Bitcoin blockchain for each sidechain PoW.
So if a miner finds the solution to a sidechain block, it is announced to the sidechain network, and the sidechain network adds a miner rewarding transaction into the Bitcoin blockchain. This Bitcoin transaction can hold the hash of the solved sidechain block, linking both chains.
- A rollback of the Bitcoin blockchain would also rollback all sidechain transactions made in the time period that is being rolled back. A rolback should be a rare event but if it happens it would also affect all linked sidechains.
- Each solved sidechain block is subject to a Bitcoin transaction fee, as a transaction is included for each solved sidechain block. Sort of like a Bitcoin tax. But it would be very  tiny since the fee can be divided over all transactions in the sidechain block.
- Settlement of sidechain transaction fees uses the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas settlement of a sidechain transaction ofcourse uses the sidechains own blockchain.

As long as there is a block which cointains all bitcoin, the previous blocks can be forgotten.
Now, suppose that there is a finite number of addresses, and each address can only be used once and has to be spent in full. Now, you can construct a single block containing all bitcoin by simply listing all existing addresses in that block.
The previous blocks are no longer needed - except to the extend needed to rewind and to prevent double spends.

Can't the protocol be changed such that there is not a single PoW per block but several, each having their own reward?
These PoWs should be computable in parallel, such that a mining pool will have only a small chance of computing all PoWs of a single block.
So split up the transactions evenly, deterministically and randomly, and demand a PoW for each set. Also split the block reward.
Example: apply some hash function to the amount of each transaction. Demand a PoW1 for all transactions for which this hash function produces an odd number, as well as a PoW2 for a set of transactions for which this hash function produces an even number. This effectively splits the transactions evenly, deterministically and randomly in two sets and each set has its own PoW which can be computed independently of the other, i.e., in parallel. This would effectively split each block in two.
The fact that computation for each set occurs in parallel means that no miner gets to monopolize which transactions to include in a block. A miner is forced to choose one single set of transactions for which it attempts to produce a PoW. A miner which attempts to produce PoW1 as well as PoW2 would likely end up producing neither as first because this would take twice as much time. Miners which try to only compute a single PoW will be faster.
A miner would have the incentive to broadcast its partial PoW because by doing so the miner ensures a transaction holding its partial reward will also be included in the block. Other miners should have some incentive to include any existing partial PoWs in the block.

That's very disturbing. Thanks for this link.
The fundamental flaw seems to me that the block reward (currently 25 BTC, plus fees) are all awarded to the miner that found the block. I wonder if this can be solved by splitting up the block reward and demanding multiple PoWs for each block. The simplest I can come up with is having two solutions for each block, for instance the current nonce which is &lt; difficulty, but also a nonce which is &gt; somenumber, where somenumber has the same difficulty of finding. Also, the transactions included for the two PoWs should be distinct and non-overlapping. This makes it impossible to search for the two PoWs in parallel. The split of transactions between the two PoWs should be random and deterministic, outside the control of the miner.
What this does (I imagine) is that there is no way for a miner to control all transactions. Instead of splitting the PoWs in two, one can also split it up in 5 PoWs.
any comments on this perhaps?
To me it seems that if there is any solution, it should be breaking up the coinbase reward and demand several PoWs, each for a distinct set of work.

Several posts on reddit indicate lists of passport numbers exist. If this is true, it would be trivial to obtain a large number of proof of passports.
And I am really struggling with the problem that this is supposed to solve. Mike gives an example where someone enters a public place, and connects to the internet using a random wifi hotspot. This hotspot is then not a real hotspot but a fake one set up for this man-in-the-middle attack. It creates a simulation of the bitcoin network with fake nodes to trick the connected clients that they are connected to the real network. A transaction by the client would seem to have gone through fine, however it would  never be sent to and confirmed by the real nodes.
So, for this attack to work, someone must be tricked to connect to the internet through a malicious provider, and chose not to verify adequatly whether his transaction has been accepted by the network.
I think this attack vector is difficult to execute because it relies on a naive and careless user connecting through a malicious link. Also, the proposed solution does not resolve the issue at all. Indeed, there must be much better ways of verifying whether nodes are real. For instance, by implementing a challenge-response between nodes, such that nodes can verify that a node they connected to a month ago is still the same node and not part of a new simulation. Do this for a couple of nodes, and in this way it can be verified that at least some nodes (ones that had been seen before) are the same one as during the first time a connection was set up with them. This would require a man-in-the-middle attack using a simulation to convince a node to send its transaction while only connected to nodes it sees for the first time. A node that usually sees a significant number of known nodes would be alerted by this and refuse to send the transaction.
Or am I missing something?

Workaround: send the merchant a bunch of presigned transactions, one for each period. It then becomes the responsibility of the merchant to submit the presigned transactions to the network timely.
Such subscription is not automatically renewed, in the traditional sense. What OP seems to want is an automatic debit. With bitcoin, that is impossible, thankfully. What I like about the above scheme is that the payer has ultimate control on whether he pays the next term of his subscription, and also dictates for how long subscription payments are allowed to continue. I think this is very healthy, as I'm sure many people forget about all these recurring payments being silently debited from their bank accounts.

3. Isn't there a much easier way to mitigate the risk the issue opens up, for instance using a challenge / response sequence between nodes, by which a node can prove to be the same node as it was when it was first seen by its peer?

Can't wait for deflation, can't wait to stop spending and wreck to economy. I will stop buying food at the supermarket, because next month the price will be lower! I will not go to the movies today, I'll go three months from now and save a cool 1% on the ticket price. I'm in the middle of a renovation of my house, but I stopped because, you know, buying that kitchen now would just be throwing money out of the window, better wait a year to shave off 2% of the price. My shoes are worn out but I guess they can last six months longer. And I've actually always wanted long hair. Some lightbulbs need replacement but that can wait a couple of months.

Counterparty at least has had the fairest launch I've seen in an alt-coin. The coin can't be mined. There was a one month window in january where you could get XCP by burning* BTC.
It has features unlike any other alt-coin. It's the first functioning decentralized exchange, a genuine step forward and quite an achievement.
The devs are hyper-active and do not have a get-rich-quick attitude. They reimbursed me for some XCP I lost in the early days.
XCP is very promising and I'm following them closely. No doubt a lot has still to be done, though.
*Burning means sending it to an address for which the private ke can't be recovered  ("1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXX" + hash).

Taking his comments on its face value, Dimon wants us to believe he is genuinely concerned about the public interest, the greater good, and that he strongly believes that bitcoin is a threat to this because it can be used by criminals. Also, he must think that everyone is a criminal.
Dimon must also be in favour of abolishing cash money, specifically, the 100 dollar bill, the most-used means of exchange of value between criminals worldwide.
Or perhaps Dimon thinks it is a good thing that the USA uses the honest, and hard earned money collected through tax from its citizens to treat these same citizens as criminals by setting up programs that seek to spy on them as much as possible.
But his actions have proven that he only cares about the profit of his bank, and has shown to be responsible for duping each and every citizen by manipulating benchmark interest rates.

First of all, great that you are accepting bitcoin!
I think that all you need to do is to simply get your visitors interested in Bitcoin. The best way to do that would be to offer a small reward for paying in bitcoin.
This can be a trivial reward - a coupon which offers a small discount on their next purchase, or a small gift.
What this will do is that it shows that you prefer Bitcoin payments over other options, which looks great on Bitcoin. You could even consider to put a small button such as "Why we prefer bitcoin" which allows you to explain the benefits of Bitcoin for you and thus for the visitor. After all, with your small gift, you share the benefits with your visitor.
Now, I am pretty sure some visitors will get interested and will want to find out what this Bitcoin is all about. Don't expect miracles, but I think that a cautious and positive approach like this might convince some of your visitors to try out Bitcoin.

*The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto’s role in the founding of Bitcoin.*
Newsweek is saying here that they are relying on Leah McGrath Goodman to have reported factually, and based on that believe, they can stand behind her story. But I wonder for how long Newsweek can hold this up. At some point they will have to drop support for their Senior Editor publicly to safe face or what little is left of it. There are now serious doubts about her claims.
Her "research" is a textbook example of confirmation bias. The defense of Mrs. Goodman in interviews is extremely poor and comes down to claiming that Mr. Nakamoto knew she was talking about bitcoin when he said he was "no longer involved in that", whereas Mr. Nakamoto, whose native language is Japanese, says that it was a misunderstanding. It's literally his word against hers. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Is there a recording of the encounter? As a research journalist, if are not recording at least the audio of an encounter of who you think could be the inventor of bitcoin, you're incompetent or planning to lie about what is being said. And if Mrs. Goodman has a recording, then she should share it so we don't have to take her word for it and can judge for ourselves.

Ok but the whole point of my proposal is to *not* allow a single miner to control all transactions in a block. The transactions are split evenly and deterministically among PoWs. So if there are 3 non-parallellizable PoWs per block, a miner has to chose one. If it tries to find more than one in parallel, the miner will lose against pools that direct all mining power to a single PoW. So each miner is incentified to work on one PoW at a time. This means that each block will mostly contain transactions with a PoW of multiple miners. In addition, I'd propose the included transactions of a PoW to be a function of the characteristics of the found PoW itself. Just a fancy way of saying that a miner should not be able to pick and chose which transactions it is calculating a proof for. For instance, in the case of 3 PoWs, let it depend on the nonce mod 3. The actually included transactions should be determined by the protocol randomly and deterministically.
I don't know if any of this makes sense and I tremendously appreciate the time you take out to respond.

Greg, can you imagine a situation where a conflict of interest arises between Blockstream and Bitcoin proper?
For instance, as Pieter might have some good ideas to improve Bitcoin, however these improvements would lower the value proposition of Blockstream, for instance because these improvements obsolete some of Blockstreams features. Pieter can ten decide not to implement the improvements into Bitcoin, in order to protect the value of Blockstream.

The merchant will be the one paying 3% when for instance Venmo is used in a shop.
All these "free" payment systems pop up all over the place because there is buckets of money to be made. Indeed, these services do not exist out of charity. They are not for free. The merchant pays the fees, which will be added to the price tag of the item that you buy. So in the end it is the customer in the shop that pays for the fees.
The fees for accepting bitcoin payments are much lower. I expect merchants to highly prefer bitcoin payments over all others, simply because of its low fees. And if I were a merchant, I would long for the day where I could kindly advise Visa, Mastercard, AmericanExpress, ApplePay, Venmo, Google Wallet and the banks that their payment services are no longer needed, because Bitcoin.
Merchants might very well drive Bitcoin adoption.

If we want Bitcoin to natively support the non-Bitcoin data that they store in the blockchain, then there should be a BIP and after everyone agrees that it's a good idea, it can be made part of Bitcoin.
Currently, these protocols repurpose fields in the blockchain, effectively avoiding having to go through a BIP process, and force node operators to support their protocols as well.
If we want support additional functions on top of Bitcoin in the blockchain, then it should be introduced through the BIP process. Else, it should be conceded that it is unwanted.

You're assuming many things here.
1. High inflation leads to people spending their money as quickly as possible. I suppose the economy must be doing great in Argentina then. All these new cars... fridges... Seriously, what happens in reality is that people spend their money on necessities and try to convert savings into something that keeps its value better, such as dollars or gold.
2. High deflation therefore leads to people spending their money as slowly as possible. But only a small part of the expenses that are spent using the disposible income can be postponed. For the rest - well, I'm sceptic but for the sake of discussion let's assume that at 20% deflation a year, people hoard all they possibly can, never spend it, until the grave.
3. Extrapolating results in behavior at high deflation to low deflation, means that people hoard more, spend less, hurting the economy.
I don't agree at all. If that were true, everyone would lock away their money in deposits and reap a couple of percent interest. In other words, already today interest on deposits offer the same effect as deflation. But most people don't put all their money in saving accounts. No, they still spend it. Amazing!

Economic incentives are stacked against truthful, independent audits. To begin with, a company negotiates the contract with an auditor. A company has an economic incentive to choose an auditor which is likely to produce a report that is favourable to the company. A company may negotiate a low price, forcing an auditor to cut corners, disabling them to do a proper audit. A company often provides the auditor with extra business by asking them for advice in the area of IT-systems or procedures. Auditors have an economic incentive to offer extra consultancy services. However this creates a conflict of interest as the auditor may loose its consultancy business if it produces an unfavourable audit report.
The primary purpose of an audit is to enhance the credibility of the financial statements of a company. Providing additional consultancy services reduces the credibility of an auditor.
Publicly verifiable controls by use of the block-chain do not require investors any time at all to verify. Instead, users of the business, especially of an exchange, will continually verify these controls and warn others is anything is wrong through public forums such as Reddit and Bitcointalk. Users of the exchange would very quickly find out if something were wrong through these channels, and can pack up and leave for a better exchange. This forces exchanges to be verifiably honest. This is something an audit can never achieve.
There have been enough [accounting scandals]( to be sceptical about the efficacy of auditing.

Exactly. The person or group that invented bitcoin went through great lengths to stay anonymous. Yet Leah McGrath Goodman believed the inventor used his real name. Then from a group of Satoshi Nakamoto's, her team started to eliminate possibilities, until there was one person left. Since they could not find a valid reason why he could *not* be Satoshi Nakamoto, she concluded she must have found him.
She started to e-mail with him about model trains without revealing she was a journalist and that she was investigating him, which is generally regarded as unethical. Then she harassed him in front of his home, and he called the police. The rest is history.
At best it is confirmation bias, but it might as well be a publicity stunt at the expense of Mr. Nakamoto, an eldery man who had a stroke and suffers from prostate cancer, lives with his 93 year old mother and who just wants to be left in peace.
Either way it's disgusting.

This is one of the reasons I think it is not acceptable to have altcoins such as Counterparty and colored coins to use the Bitcoin blockchain in any way.
Only a fraction of the Bitcoin community uses these altcoins, yet it uses up bandwidth and causes the blockchain to grow faster, impacting every Bitcoin user that runs a full node. It is parasitical and makes it more expensive to run a full node, which inevitably causes there to be less of them.

I've learned this about Leah McGrath Goodman:
She thinks it's fine to violate the privacy and harrass a 64 year old man which takes care of his 93 year old mother, who had a stroke and suffers from cancer.
She sees no issue in contacting him about his hobby model trains without revealing that she is actually a journalist (sic) and is investigating him.

Provided that the Bitcoin network is still around by the time you want to spend. Also, this processing has no economic value for the spender.


By the time you have bitcoin, you already used up this disk space. The bitcoin you have is not backed by any unused disk space. It is backed by your believe that by the time you want to spend, disk space will be allocated in order to facilitate your transactions. Also, again this disk space has close to zero economic value for the spender - you cannot in any practical way use it for storing files.
A currency backed by disk space means that for every unit of currency, some amount of disk space exists that can be readily used. For instance, if I own 1 DSK, I would see "1 GB available" in Windows explorer when I'd select my DSK powered network drive.

No more transaction history means increased privacy and a constant sized blockchain, instead of one that grows indefinitely.

Same way as now.
A way to look at it is that it is Bitcoin as-is, except that addresses can not be spent partially. The entire amount must be spent.
As a simplified example, imagine the genesis block of 50 BTC, which created 50 private keys of 1 BTC each. The 50 coins (i.e., 50 private keys) are owned by person P. The genesis block contains the 50 addresses (public keys) of the 1 BTC coins.
Suppose there are no transactions in block 2. Block 2 is exactly the same as block 1, plus an additional 50 coins (coinbase). There is no need to keep block 1.
Suppose P transfers 1 BTC to Q by proving to the network that he owns the private key to coin C1, worth 1 BTC. Block 3 is the same as block 2 except for the 50 newly created coins *and* for the public key of coin C1. Only person Q can now derive the private key of coin C1. The private key to C1 owned by P is no longer valid.

To be able to "mine" interest with Proof-of-Stake requires your wallet be unlocked and come online regularly (for instance every 30 days). That's a security concern. Also I'm not sure if a hardware wallet (like a Trezor) could work with PoS, but perhaps someone can chime in on that.

* Developers that were most productive by far for Bitcoin Core now tied up in a commercial project that seems to lack a clear plan, and it is slowing down regular, non-sidechain Bitcoin Core development considerately.
* Investors sooner or later will want to see direction and ultimately *returns*.
* Bitcoin Core development by Blockstream is commercially driven while independent Bitcoin Core developers are technically and ideologically driven. This can be a source of conflicts.

Use segwit enabled software or service providers to reduce fees.
Raising the block weight limit with a hardfork is not an option as long as the current capacity of Bitcoin is not being fully utilized.
Segwit offers almost double capacity but is currently not being used to its full potential because key service providers like Coinbase and popular wallets like Bread have not implemented segwit and are forcing users to pay higher fees.


It is a hardfork and for that reason alone a nearly impossible to execute change.

You're right - we're not slaves as we don't get the whip and can't be deported or locked up. I agree that there are legitimate reasons for laws against money laundering as we want thieves and scammers to be sentenced. So I'm backing down in that respect from my admittedly strong comments above.
That said I'm seeing increasing problems with the corrupt fiat system in combination with increasing abuses of powers of governments. Laws are invented to fight crimes nobody wants, but once in place, governments stretch the interpretation of these laws and often start to abuse them. History has proven time and again that governments will turn against the population, even in democracies.
I'm convinced that fiat based economies are unsustainable and that the problems we had will continue to exist, and that people will increasingly start looking for a better alternative.

The instability of bitcoin exchanges and wallet thefts are disturbing, however regulation is not going to help at all. What must be understood by regulators is that at present there is enormous technological momentum. Techniques such as multisig and cryptographic proof of reserve are in the spotlight because of the recent issues.
For the forseeable future, each adverse event with regards to Bitcoin will spark initiatives to protect from such event. The "hacks" as you call it are indeed not of any concern in the long run. Actually, they are a necessity to make Bitcoin safer.
Bitcoin will learn from its own mistakes and grow stronger. I fail to see what kind of regulation specific to Bitcoin could have been of any help to prevent exchanges from going down, or wallets getting emptied.

Bernie Maddoffs ponzi scheme, AIG's junk "triple-A" RMBSses happened when Sox was in full effect. You might argue that no system is perfect and that real improvement has been made, and I agree to that fully. However in the world of finance the forces of capital are so great that regulators will always be one step behind reality. Whatever regulations are imposed, if there is the tiniest loophole then it will be found and it will be taken advantage of. Only when regulations are perfect and - projected on auditing - no incentives exist for auditors to misrepresent financial statements, only then abuse will stop.
At least, in the US. The world however is a big place with lots of lightly regulated jurisdictions, and a corporation can be structured such that the burden of US regulations is felt a lot less. Ultimately, overregulation and rising compliance cost may drive business out of the US or stifle innovation. For instance, setting up a bitcoin exchange in the US is cost prohibitive because of regulation.
If regulations become too stringent, businesses will just route around them. The compliance cost of Dodd-Frank and the Volckler rule can make it unprofitable for some foreign businesses to continue to do business with the US, especially if it concerns a non-strategic part of their total business. What I'm getting at is that there is a limit as to how much regulation is tolerated in a jurisdiction. Capital is liquid and will seek to flow around these mountains of regulation. The financial sector has been growing tremendously in Asia and one of the reasons for that is the increasing difference in regulatory friction between Asia and the US plus Europe.
Failing regulation is answered by imposing more regulation, seemingly under the believe that financial crises can be prevented by proper regulation. This is of course not the case. Our monetary system is driven by debt and consequently facilitates gambling with other peoples money, which is why crises and bubbles will continue to manifest themselves, regardless of whatever regulation is imposed.
Back to auditing. Regulations pertaining to auditing will certainly diminish misincentives and do make it harder for companies to cook the books, but not impossible. It can't be made impossible, so it will continue to happen. I would also agree that perhaps it does not happen all the time, and that most companies are dutifully and faithfully audited. The audits of profitable, normally functioning companies must be rather boring. The ultimate challenge for an auditor is to discover *and disclose* that a healthy looking company is on the brink of going under. That's when it counts. Such disclosure would however ruin its client and also the auditor, as the auditor will be litigated by its client like there's no tomorrow and shunned by other companies like the black plague. I maintain therefore that conflict of interest can't be prevented and that auditing has serious credibility issues.
I will not argue against your point that auditors can also add value because they are highly skilled at identifying te key risks of a business and are able to advise management on how to mitigate these risks. However, giving such advises are nothing less than a form of consultancy, which the auditing company will not do for free and consequently creates a conflict of interest.
The block-chain provides full transparancy for the bitcoin part. Exchanges can be forced to open the books not just for auditors at scheduled time intervals, but *all the time* for *everyone*. I'd agree though that bitcoin assets are only a part of the story, even for a bitcoin exchange, which also has fiat and other liabilities. I am just not convinced that auditing is the answer. I'm more inclined that the answer lies in enforcing as much as controls as possible through the blockchain, and building trust with its clients and investors by voluntarily being as transparent as possible.

I don't consider wealth stored in a bank to be secure. First of all, it means trust in the bank to not default, and if it defaults, trust that the government will bail you out. Cyprus is an example where the government just freezes all bank accounts and confiscates a significant parts of it.
Apart from that, your bank account may nominally grow a bit through interest, but shrink in buying power because inflation is larger. Inflation will eat it. Inflation is government-induced and zaps your wealth silently if you choose to keep it as cash in a bank account.

Great topic, thanks for making a separate post of our nice discussion in that other thread, OP.
I'll repost my thoughts so others can comment as well.
This question can be rephrased as "how would a mortgage work in a deflationary economy?"
Mortgages and loan would work exactly the same as now from an economic point of view. Only the accounting differs.
In a hypothetical, highly deflationary economy, the interest rates would simply be negative to compensate for the deflation. 
Example. Assume an economic bitcoin environment with a stable 20% deflation per year. A 10y fixed loan of 1,000 btc taken out today, would perhaps "cost" -16%. Yes, after 1 year, only 840 btc would have to be paid back, 16% less. Again one year later, the mortgage amount would become 706 btc, again 16% less. But it my house and everything else also decreases nominally in value, with 20% per year. So in this example I'm effectively paying 4% interest.
Each monthly mortgage payment would be nominally lower than the one before it, since the mortgage amount also decreases nominally.
So economic principles keep working as normal. Mortgages and loans still work. Only the numbers change and there would be negative rates. The only reason it can't work like this today is because of the *volatility* of bitcoin. But if it were stable and predictable, banks would simply offer negative rates.

I totally agree. It is a complete waste of time. Engaging in a discussion with Lawsky has turned out to be a complete waste of time as well.
I am not surprised. There will not be a single government of a high-tax country that will ever be conductive Bitcoin. Nice words will be spoken, but ultimately Bitcoin will be regulated enough to prevent any business from accepting it.
I wonder what these proposed regulations will mean for businesses in the US that accept bitcoin. Are they going to have to exclude NY customers? How? I guess bitcoin payment processors will have to hire lawyers and adapt their IT systems to comply, and these costs will add to the cost of accepting bitcoin.
Other businesses might be put off by the regulatory tsunami that is building up. The announced NY regulation might very well stop merchant adoption in its tracks. Not only in NY but everywhere in the US *and* outside the US.
If that happens, Bitcoin will simmer underground for perhaps years in a legal gray area. Adoption will initially stall, the price of a bitcoin may fall dramatically, even to sub USD 100 levels. But although the upcoming regulations likely sabotages its use as a means of consumer to US-based business payments, its function of as a long-term store of value is not affected. In other words, hodlers are not affected.
I predict that Bitcoin will face a few difficult years where governments of high-tax countries will fight it. But the dynamics are in favor of Bitcoin.
Highly indebted governments are forced to either continue to raise taxes to unreasonable levels and/or inflate away debt by printing money. Both will make Bitcoin rebound spectacularly. Even if not a single good can be purchased directly with bitcoin, as long as a functioning exchange between fiat and bitcoin exists, it will be a safe haven for people who see their savings melt and/or their income increasingly fall into the hands of their government.
Another dynamic is the low-tax jurisdictions for instance in Asia that might very well embrace bitcoin and attract low margin / high volume businesses. Some businesses might incorporate in a bitcoin friendly jurisdiction to gain a crucial competitive advantage over for instance US based businesses that are stuck with expensive payment processors and have to deal with fraudulent chargebacks, but can't use Bitcoin due to regulatory restraints.
All in all, tough but interesting times ahead.

More generally, you might say that bitcoin are backed by trust in the Bitcoin protocol and its implementation. It is the presence of this trust that give bitcoin their value.
An error in the protocol or a bug in its implementation diminishes this trust and can cause their value to plummet, and this has in fact happened in the past.
But bitcoin are not backed by any promise of  anything of value, such as money or gold, or disk storage / bandwidth / computer processing power, which x seemed to envision.

For what it's worth, I have to side fully with luke-jr.
The blockchain is designed to support Bitcoin. If protocols like Mastercoin and Counterparty need support in Bitcoin Core, they are free to submit a BIP.
Instead, they work around that and just repurpose Bitcoin data fields for their own altcoin without creating sufficient support for this first. I know there is not sufficient support, because if there was, a BIP could have been submitted and adopted.
Mastercoin, Counterparty and utilities that store complete files in the blockchain serve only a small fraction of the Bitcoin community at best. Yet they pollute the blockchain and force nodes that want to support Bitcoin to also support these other uses of the blockchain that they never asked for and may not want to support.
Technical changes in the future to improve Bitcoin might become very complex or even impossible because for instance a change in a field would break some SmartypantsCoin that depends on it.
Either Bitcoin Core developers acknowledge that Mastercoin, Counterparty, storing files in the blockchain etc. are a great idea and accomodate them through a BIP and subsequent protocol changes, or they concede it is unwanted.

Bitcoin really doesn't need this. I think it is a bad idea as well. Imagine having persuaded your family and friends to buy bitcoin 10 months ago at USD 800. No matter how much you'd argue that the price will go to the moon, your friendly advice would have lost them money and it would not have reflected very favourably on you.

Better is to recommend bitcoin if you see a person can benefit from its use. For instance to someone doing remittances, or to someone with a webshop.
I think merchants may very well drive adoption as they have a true monetary incentive to accept bitcoin. And the next financial crisis will land bitcoin squarely on the moon.

In an escrow solution, the money would first be deposited with an arbitrator, who will transfer the funds as soon as the buyer agrees. The buyer will instruct to send the funds when all goods have been delivered in good order.
In case of a dispute, where the buyer claims to be wronged by the seller, the arbitrator will decide where the funds go.
The arbitrator can request proof from the seller that the goods were sent, or proof from the buyer that there were damages. Based on this, the arbitrator decides.
Buyers and sellers may build a reputation that may give them cheaper prices for using an arbitrator, similar to how car insurance works.
This is as good as it gets, I see no way to improve on this scheme. With the help of multisig, arbitration services can be implemented very efficiently and save, and in such a way that the arbitrator can not run off with the funds. This is genuine innovation that can make these services proliferate very quickly.

I wouldn't call the weather predictable, but derivatives let you trade it plenty. So I'm afraid this is simply not true. The entire point of derivatives is to either hedge risk related to the price of the underlying (insurance), or to speculate on the price (gambling). They are useful in case of an unpredictably priced underlying, so bitcoin would be a suitable candidate. And indeed bitcoin derivatives do already exist, only they are not very liquid, which is not surprising given the volumes of bitcoin itself, plus all the security issues around exchanges. But you can even trade the difficulty, if you wanted. To hedge miner equipment purchases paid for in advance, for instance.
The stability is a non-issue to the widespread adoption of bitcoin. To achieve widespread adoption, bitcoin does not require to be used as a unit of account. All risks related to its volatility can be hedged. And anyways: unit of account on which ledgers? Bitcoin is global.
Or let me just ask: if bitcoin were too volatile to use as a unit of account, then why would that hamper adoption, in a future world where these volatility risks can be hedged away cheaply and effortlessly?

Winning the block reward is a lottery which has a chance of winning which is proportional to the hash rate. Mathematically, a solo miner has an equal expectation on the number of bitcoins it will earn as a miner in a pool. It's just that being certain to get 2.5 BTC in the lifetime of the equipment (pooled miner) is preferred over having a 1 in 10 chance on 25 bitcoins (solo miner).
The expected amount of bitcoin is equal for both (2.5).
So I'm afraid your statement is incorrect.
EDIT: you are right as you explained elsewhere in this thread - mining with the pool that finds the most blocks hands you a headstart more often.

A block reward that is split across different miners by enforcing a ~~non-parallelizable~~ separate PoW for each subset of transactions.
Actually, to improve significantly on the above: assign the transactions to the PoW after the fact. For instance, each block requires three PoWs where the (nonce mod 3) is 0, 1 and 2. Each PoW assigns one third of the transactions to its set, chosing the transactions deterministically depending on the value of nonce mod 3.
This makes it impossible for a miner to target his own transactions, because the miner does not know what value nonce mod 3 will have in advance.
EDIT: on "non-parallelizable" - what I meant is: any one miner should not be able to search for multiple PoWs with the same effort as searching for a single PoW. Of course, multiple miners can each search for one of the PoWs in parallel. The effect will be that transactions in a single block are mined by multiple miners, even if a miner has &gt; 50% hash rate.

In a full bitcoin economy, keeping deflation at a high rate of 20% would mean that currency would need to be *destroyed*.
For instance, the bitcoin software would have to deflate the amount of bitcoin by 20% annually.
That would mean that everyone would lose bitcoin if they held on to it. Any balance would be zapped by 20% per year.

So you are saying that the bitcoin community should be totally ok with having to put all trust in the good intentions of just a few people that, when conspiring, have the power to pull off a 51% attack and effectively kill bitcoin?


No they wouldn't. A miner is a pool operator. There is only very few miners in bitcoinland (12?). The people that own the mining equipment basically just provide their hashing power to a miner in return of a reward. The equipment owners have nothing to say about what block is valid or not, or which transactions to include.
So two conspiring miners having &gt; 50% could kill bitcoin if they wanted to. The disincentive is not as large as you think. Perhaps they'd kill bitcoin just because they can, or because they were given an incentive to do so, for instance by a government.

Ok, so they were talking about the utility of bitcoin as a unit of account. Indeed, today it is not suitable for that (although in the past it has been more suitable than fiat for pricing mining hardware).
Nobody knows how the volatility of bitcoin will develop. But generally the reasonable expectation is that it will decrease.
I believe that derivatives (swaps, futures and options) will address volatility related issues, and will reduce volatility itself as well. The volatility of bitcoin can then simply be hedged, just like companies use swaps today to hedge away risks related to interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, energy prices, food prices, weather,  etc. etc.
So it's a non-issue, really.

I honestly don't get the issue. So just to be clear on what I think would happen:
I am a localbitcoin trader in Argentina. I have an account at Bitstamp. You received a remittance in BTC that you wish to convert to pesos. I buy your BTC with pesos with a discount. I then immediately sell the BTC for dollars on Bitstamp. I wire my dollars to some dollar bank account I can access using an ATM in Argentina. Or I go to the bank branch of my bank and withdraw pesos there for possibly lower cost / better rates. Cycle complete.
There is a cost to this, and it might only be profitable when buying your BTC for a 10% discount. But other than that I see no issue.

Sidechains, specifically.
I just have a hard time understanding the motivations of the investors. If they believe in Bitcoin, they might just as well have left the developers alone and just use the money to buy BTC. Or better yet, donate the money into a fund which supports developers. Bitcoin Core development would have continued mostly as-is.
Instead, a company is founded (Blockstream) and focus is put on sidechains.
This seems to tell me that the investors see some opportunity that is more interesting than "just" supporting Bitcoin Core development through a fund. Yet there is no clear road ahead or business plan.
Just don't get it.

**Proposed solution**
Disclaimer: I might not know enough of the protocol and miss a few obvious reasons as to why this can't work, but for the love of a better world, *here goes anyway*:
People flock to the larger pools to reduce variance. Also, it has been reported that mining at GHash somehow is more rewarding than mining at other pools, which is very alarming because that means GHash may be screwing around with other pools and it results in people not wanting to switch, exacerbating the problem.
This is why this has to be solved on the protocol level.
Currently the entire block reward (coinbase + fees) are under the control of a single miner (pool operator). It's all or nothing - either the miner finds a block and gets the entire reward, or it gets nothing.
My proposal would be to split up the block reward in more pieces, so that multiple miners can compete for it. Of course, it should not be possible to search for more than one PoW in parallel. So a miner has to decide on a single PoW to have a reasonable chance of finding it before another miner finds it.
Right now the PoW consists of finding a hash for the entire block with all transactions with a nonce &lt; target, where target represents the difficulty. So, a single miner approves the entire block with one hash.
An improvement might be to split up the transactions in a block and require a separate PoW for each set. For instance, there is an algorithm which randomly but deterministically defines which transactions require which PoW.
Suppose there are three PoWs required for a block, PoW1, PoW2, PoW3. Each PoW has 1/3 of the transactions and receives 1/3 of the coinbase, and all fees associated with the transactions. To find which transactions belong to PoW1, an algorithm is executed that randomly but deterministically selects a set of transactions from the mempool. Then, the miner tries to find a PoW for this set of transactions. If found, it broadcasts it, in order to lock in the reward. In the mean time, PoW2 and PoW3 may or may not have been found. But even if a miner has 50% of all available hash power, more often than not a different miner will have found PoW2 or PoW3 in the mean time.
The effect is that a block is effectively mined by multiple miners, and the reward is split amongst them. Also, a single miner no longer can control all the transactions in a succession of blocks, significantly reducing the possible abuses of having &gt; 50% of hash power. Finally, it reduces variance threefold, because there are now three block rewards instead of one.
But admittedly I don't know enough of the protocol to know if this can work in principle.

Currently we are in the situation that we have to trust GHash to not be malicious. Bitcoin is now basically centralized. Its a time bomb.

The colored coins concept is flawed in the sense that it is using the protocol in ways that it was not designed for.
Future changes to the protocol might adversely affect colored coins. The core devs will not show any restraint of changes that would affect or even kill colored coins but improve the protocol. We've seen that recently when OP_RETURN went from 80 to 40 bytes, to the chagrin of Counterparty devs.
To be honest I think the protocol should not be used parasitically in some smarty pants ways in order to create functionality for only a small subset of the bitcoin community.

This aims to solve some disadvantages of multi-sig. Quoting:
"There was already considerable effort to realize two-factor authentication for Bitcoin wallets. First of all, it is in principle possible to use Bitcoin’s build-in functionality for threshold signatures. This has, however, three major disadvantages: First of all, it would be visible in the blockchain that multi-factor authentication is used. Second, the size of the transaction increases, which leads to higher transaction fees. Last but not least, there are Bitcoin clients around which do not work properly with the threshold-signature extension."

I just used the swap as an example. With a swap, any price fluctuations are generally offset daily, for the duration of the swap. Every day, some money is transferred between the hedger on the one end of the swap, and the speculator on the other end.
Risk can also be offset using a future or forward. For instance, imagine that you expect a payment of 100 BTC halfway january 2015, and that today, 1 BTC is worth USD 380. Of course, you don't know what a BTC will be worth in three months. If you don't do anything, you may end up receiving USD 350 per BTC, or perhaps if you are more lucky, 500 USD per BTC. Most businesses will not accept this uncertainty however and will seek to lock in a fixed price per BTC using a future contract. In tradespeak, they want to hedge their currency risk.
That can be done with a BTC future. For instance, on [OrderBook]( (formerly known as ICBIT) bitcoin futures are traded. In particular, note the [january 2015 futures contract ("BUF5")]( and its [price]( (select the contract in the dropdown). At the moment of writing, the BUF5 contract values 1 BTC at USD 395 when the contract expires at January 16, 2015 at exactly 20:00 UTC.
The currency risk can now be hedged by buying sufficient BUF5 contracts on the exchange to match the incoming amount of 100 BTC. Now, the 100 BTC has effectively been sold for USD 395 per BTC on January 16th, 2015. The hedger can be certain to receive USD 39,500 (ignoring counterparty risk here for the sake of simplicity).
The speculator(s) on the other end of the contract have effectively bought BTC at USD 395 on January 16th. They are betting that by that time, 1 BTC will be worth more than that, and pocket the difference.

A universal Bitcoin based insurance / arbitrage system can be devised using multi-sig.
You pay SketchyBusiness using multi-sig. The arbiter is 30DaysMoneyBackGuarantee who will let the payment through to SketchyBusiness after 30 days, and serves as an arbitrager if there are any complaints from the buyer. If the buyer is right, 30DaysMoneyBackGuarantee returns the bitcoin to buyer.
There are many variations on the theme, as well as gradations in how consumer friendly or business friendly an arbitrager can be. Consumers and businesses will be free to do business with an arbitrager of their choice.

What if GHash is "contributing" some of its hashing power to other pools, but keeps any block it finds for itself, so it seems other pools are less lucky and GHash is more lucky? It could lead to GHash seemingly finding more blocks with less hashing power compared to other pools, resulting in the effect as OP is describing.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:05:18




The price per hash is missing in this equation. It should be considered as well because it has a major effect. The decreasing cost of hashing power counters the effects of the falling total reward and helps in keeping the network secure.
The total hashrate is a function of the price per hash and the miner reward. More specifically:
TotalHashrate ~= MinerReward / PricePerHash
If the miner reward decreases, but the price per hash also decreases with an equal factor, then the network will remain equally secure.

Or create multiple separate PoWs and split up the block reward amongst them. Then having &gt; 50% of hash rate is not enough to control all transactions in a block. Smaller miners are likely to find PoWs in the block as well. A large miner could try to find all PoWs simultaneously, but would lose out miners that direct all mining power to a single PoW.

Yes, that's no good. It can be solved by making it impossible to predict the %3 of any tx, for instance by making it pseudorandom as for instance a function of an immutable transaction property and the last found nonce. So, hash(tx_property, final_nonce) %3 of a transaction defines to which PoW it belongs.
I see now that each time a solution is found, it needs to be broadcast so it is known which transactions were included for a particular PoW. Since a miner does now know which transactions it is creating a PoW for, it needs to consider all transactions in the mempool for inclusion in the block (according to its as-is algorithm). That means a block and all included transactions need to be broadcast for each PoW however this information doesn't need to be stored in the blockchain.
Example. Suppose the miner that found PoW1 included transactions 1, 2, 3, 5, the miner that found PoW2 included 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the miner that found PoW3 included 1, 2, 5. Suppose as well, after applying hash(tx_property, final_nonce) %3 to each transaction, it turns out that PoW1 is valid for tx 1, 2, PoW2 is valid for 3, 4 and PoW3 is valid for 5, 6. The set of valid transactions will then be 1, 2 (PoW1), 3, 4 (PoW2) and 5 (PoW3). Transaction 6 is not included in the block as valid, since it belongs to PoW3, and PoW3 did not include transaction 6.


Since the difficulty for all PoWs is equal, the security behind each PoW is the same. So nonce &lt; target for all PoWs.


But what is the difference with today? It is already possible to include a transaction with &lt; 50% of the hashpower behind you. For instance, 1 in 20 blocks are validated by a miner which has only 5% of the hashpower behind it.


I imagine one or more transactions are inserted in the mempool that distribute the block reward to addresses as specified by the miner that found the PoW. The transactions should include the nonce of the PoW, so the protocol can recognize them as transactions that distribute the partial block reward. The amount of the reward is not known in advance as it is unknown which transactions have been included in a PoW in advance, so the fees are not yet known. That could perhaps be an issue.

On the contrary. The question and its answer lays bare what ultimately holds value. It is not gold, physical goods or bitcoin. Ultimately, it is trust.
Trust that the value of what you receive in return for the value of what you give (be it labour or a good) has about the same value.
The best humanity came up with so far has been gold for all of its unique properties that I won't repeat again. Bitcoin offers these properties as well, and is gradually building additional trust simply by continuing to exist.

You're saying that the volatility of bitcoin makes it expensive to hedge against it. I'm saying that this is not the case, because hedging instruments such as swaps and futures are zero-sum instruments. That means that if you add up the profits and/or losses of the hedger and speculator for any contract, the result will be zero. Whatever the hedger earned, came straight out of the pocket of the speculator, and the other way around. The price of the hedge has more to do with additional costs for using third parties that facilitate the trade. The height of these costs are obviously unrelated to the volatility of bitcoin. There will be some volatility related cost to finance collateral if the swap is cleared (i.e., insured against default of one of the parties). That's because the more volatile the underlying is, the higher the amount of collateral that will be demanded by the clearing. This collateral can be borrowed - incurring only minor costs given todays interest rates.
In fact the more volatile bitcoin behaves, the higher demand there will be for swaps.

Inflation does not just eat away a mortgage. Interest is due. If the interest isn't paid back, then the mortgage debt would generally grow faster than inflation.
In a hypothetical, highly deflationary economy, the interest rates would simply be negative to compensate for the deflation. 
Assume an economic bitcoin environment with 20% deflation per year. A 10y fixed loan  of 1,000 btc taken out today, would perhaps "cost" -16%. Yes, after 1 year I only would have to pay back 840 btc. But it my house also decreased nominally in value, with 20%.
Economic principles keep working as normal. Mortgages and loans still work. Only the numbers change. The only reason it can't work like this today is because of the volatility of bitcoin. But if it were stable and predictable, banks would simply pay negative rates.

Since the fiat banker is forced to produce random bank notes from his stock, maintaining a fractional reserve is harder.

Such selling would be a factor in the price going down and as a result even more mined coins need to be sold to pay the bills. The effect reinforces itself.

I'm fully aware of why there is a blockchain. My bad for saying a blockchain is not needed - of course it is.
Taking the idea one step back:
What if there were this *one* additional rule to Bitcoin *as-is*:
1. The amount of bitcoin that an address holds cannot change, except when spent, then it becomes zero.
This means an address cannot be used to receive any bitcoin. It also demands the need of fixed denominations (1 BTC / 500,000 / 200,000 / ... / 0.01 bits) such that any random amount can be transacted.
It means there will never be change, since the full amount held at an address is used. It means that an address is only used once. The life-cycle of an address would be: inception through coinbase transaction; destruction when spent. The address can be seen as a coin.
Now, if I am not mistaken, the transaction history becomes irrelevant. An address (coin) can only occur once in a transaction. When used, the address is destroyed and a new address / private key pair is created. The blockchain holds the new address, and only the receiver can derive the corresponding private key.
There would still be a blockchain, but used addresses can be discarded, effectively discarding the transaction history. All that needs to be kept at any point in time is the current set of addresses (coins) and the corresponding set of private keys by the owners of the coins.

Have a look at this [explanation of weather derivatives]( or at these [weather derivatives]( traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The *raison d'etre* for derivatives is to hedge away risks caused by volatility, high and low. A swap is really a zero-sum instrument and therefore by definition not expensive as a hedge. A hedger would enter into a swap with a speculator. The hedger locks in a fixed exchange rate for bitcoin for a period of time. The speculator that takes the other side of the deal either has to pay up if bitcoin falls in value, or gets to keep a profit if bitcoin raises in value.

A private key is only used once. The block keeps record of all coins.
For example, suppose you pay someone 20,000 bits, and you own a private key worth 20,000 bits. You sign a transaction using a public key of the receiver. The end result is that the receiver can derive the valid private key of the 20,000 bits "coin", while the network invalidates (or just forgets) your 20,000 bits coin.
Double spending is prevented in the same fashion as now. So perhaps there should be a small chain, but it need not go back all the way to the genesis block.
It does not matter what the history of a coin is. There is no need to know its previous owner. Owning the private key is owning the coin. Spending the coin means transferring control over the amount to a receiver. The network will do that by invalidating your private key and allowing the receiver to derive a new private key of the coin.

You are assuming that the interests of a pool operator are aligned with that of bitcoin owners. But that does not have to be the case. For instance, a pool operator might be compelled to silently cooperate with a government to start rejecting or tracking certain transactions.

Even while approaching 1 MB per block, the number of nodes is steadily declining. The bandwidth demands are already too high for many.
If today blocks would fill up to 20 MB, only data centers would be able to run full nodes. The bandwidth requirements are too high to run a node at home unless you have fiber. The number of nodes would plummet.
One could argue that blocks will not be 20 MB, and that the max block size is only a limit. However if that is the case, then why raise the max block size to more than we need? It introduces risk for no good reason.

"Is Bitcoin to be used for every coffee purchase? Or only through centralized services that lump transactions together?"
This debate is distracting and does not help in finding a solution - we should look at what is possible now and in the future.
Let's look at the facts - feel free to challenge:
* The max block size must increase to enable support for more than three transactions per second.
* Hardforks carry risks and should be avoided. A hardfork for every increase of the max block size is not desirable.
* We don't know yet if there will be demand in the future for Bitcoin to support microtransactions on a large scale ("pay for my coffee with Bitcoin" for 1 billion people).
* Increasing the cost to run a full node will reduce the number of nodes and makes Bitcoin more centralized.
* Increasing the max block size will make running a full node more expensive because of increased bandwidth and computational resources that are required. 
* Raising the max block size has limits because of processing and bandwidth constraints.
* As technology progresses, larger blocks can be supported in the future for the same cost as today (bandwidth becomes cheaper).
* A sudden large increase of the max block size is a large functional change and therefore carries risk.
Therefore, I think that a moderate but still exponential increase of the max block size would be the best solution for the intermediate term. For instance, a one-time increase to 5 MB followed by a 40% increase per year. That will increase the max block size tenfold in two years, and hunderfold in 9 years. It'd amount to about 400 tps in ten years from now, and over 2000 tps in 15 years. For comparison, VISA handles 2000 tps on average.
My solution would therefore be to hardcode this moderate exponential growth into Bitcoin. We can be reasonably sure that it is a safe rate of increase, since a 40% growth is well below Moore's "law". Also, it creates a predictable growth, and it avoids hardforks.
This does not take other advances into account such as the lightning network or sidechains. These technologies basically defer settlement and can greatly increase the capacity of Bitcoin on their own. They may or may not be succesful - but their goals might change as capacity of Bitcoin keeps increasing exponentially over the years.
On the short term, these new technologies may be crucial to increase the capacity of Bitcoin if adoption spikes. Long term, they might be useful for instant payment confirmations or implementation of derivative contracts that generate thousands of small cash flows between parties.
Ultimately, if bandwidth cost keeps falling, Bitcoin as a widely adopted payment system used to pay every single coffee on the blockchain is very possible. It may however take 20 years to achieve.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:04:21
I think this should not turn this into a philosophical debate about the ultimate goals of Bitcoin. I think the max block size should grow to what is comfortably possible given memory and bandwidth restraints. With a conservative and gradual growth going forward, Bitcoin can buy a lot of time.
For instance, a max block size of 5 MB followed by a 40% increase yearly (= doubling two-yearly, and increasing ten-fold every 7 years) seems a good middle ground to me. Exponential growth but well slower than Moore's "law" - which should keep computational resource requirements in check while at the same time capacity grows orders of magnitude over the years.
It's nicely predictable and does not require ad hoc hard forks and longwinded, pointless discussions, while this growth will be sustainable for a long long time to come.
If an initial five-fold increase and after two more years a 10-fold increase compared to today is not enough, I'd say that it's not Bitcoin being at fault - it is the adoption rate that is too fast and needs to slow down to a pace that Bitcoin can be comfortable with.

Packet size or frame size do not limit the performance of networks, in the same way as blocksize does not have to limit the performance of Bitcoin.
To overcome limitations imposed by packet size or frame size at the protocol level, a layer has been built on top of it, being the IP protocol.
He means to say that developments like LN build on top of Bitcoin as a second layer and increase the capacity almost infinitely, making the block size an inconsequential technicality, just like packet size and frame size do not limit networking performance in any way.

Unfortunately the core dev PhantomPhreak keeps complaining about a protocol update and that now only 40 bytes can be stored where he was expecting 80.

Your idea is nice, but it is not a very safe solution. The private key on the PC will have to be stored such that it can be accessed without having to type a password - for instance unencrypted. It means that if your PC is compromised, the hacker can steal your bitcoin without having to use a keylogger.
An improvement would be to use multisig and let the PC sign first, then your phone. This is still not that safe - your bitcoin can be stolen if your phone is compromised. To improve that, bank-like functions could be implemented on the PC, such as imposing limits on how much can be transferred daily, so your bitcoin cannot be stolen all at once.
Now, if your phone is compromised, only your daily spending limit can be stolen every day. Both your phone and PC would need to be compromised to steal all your bitcoin at once.

There is no need for that. The payment processor will assume the risk for double spends, and they in turn can buy insurance for it or even leave it uninsured.
So what if a sub-100 dollar amount gets double spent once in a blue moon. Shoplifting, robberies and fraud are much bigger worries for brick-and-mortar stores. Even if they work without a payment processor, they can assume the risk themselves unless double spending becomes all the rage.
However, simply stealing an item is easier than trying to pull-off a double spend. And did you ever have to pay in advance at a restaurant or surrender your ID? No one ever stops you from leaving your table without paying. Yet it hardly happens. This whole double spend issue is non-existent in a brick-and-mortar setting.
Yet, I'd love to see faster block times. Or, as someone proposed, have parallel block chains with each their own set of transactions to distribute the load. Also battles mining centralization as a bonus.

I'm really wondering. In this setup, what establishes someone as being the owner of a stock? The fact that they have the private key to the colored coin representing the stock? Meaning that if the coins are stolen or lost, so are the stocks? Or is there a second register? If that's the case, what is the point of storing ownership in the Bitcoin blockchain redundantly as well?
Anyway, I am really thrilled that a company like Nasdaq is going to put what little is left of the 3 tps capacity of Bitcoin to good use! Surely, node operators will be totally fine with helping out Nasdaq spamming the blockchain for their own profit. /s

EDIT: that means that with increasing the max block size to 20 MB we entrust the miners to avoid centralization caused by large blocks by implementing soft caps.
This may work, but what is the benefit of this over having a exponentially growing max block size which growth is modest and such that it would diminish the risk of centralization? Why rely on the miners when you can hardcode it?

True, nice quote too.
Why not just spend addresses once only, and always in full? No more change addresses. An address would store a fixed amount (one of 1 BTC, 500 000, 200 000 ... 0.05 0.02 0.01 bits) to enable creating arbitrary amounts. No history is created, there can be only one spending transaction per address. An address acts more like a coin or note in the classical sense. The private key can be transferred using stealth addressing techniques.
I must be missing something, but not sure what.

Agree. Lots of companies have wet dreams of inventing a payment system of their own, because there's a lot of money to be made in that space. However there's now bitcoin and its rate of adoption must be big enough to instill doubt in the most ambitious CEOs.
Jobs would have loved bitcoin as a way to scare the hell out of his margin-grabbing payment processors. He'd force them to agree to lower margins, and would set up a team within Apple anyway just to investigate how bitcoin could be used to offer current payment functionality, but in a way which completely bypasses expensive payment processors.
And once a way would be found, he'd use it, saying "thanks for your services, dear payment processors, now please go fuck yourselves".

To avoid quantum computing concerns, an elliptic curve based alternative to Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman which is not susceptible to Shor's attack is the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange of De Feo, Jao and Plut. They use elliptic curve isogenies to create a drop in replacement for the quantum attackable Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. This key exchange utilizes the same elliptic curve computational primitives of existing elliptic curve cryptography and requires computational and transmission overhead similar to many currently used public key systems.

Not so for EUR. With BPI, withdrawing costs me (and I presume everybody else as well) PHP 200 and at most PHP 4,000 can be withdrawn, so that's at least 5% for starters. On top of that, international bank transfer fees are added, as any ATM will point out at some point during withdrawing. HSBC does not have the PHP 4,000 limit and also allows for withdrawals up to 20,000 PHP. It is the cheapest option. The fees are still charged, however.
On top of these costs, there is this unfavorable exchange rate. 50 centavos both ways is 1% on top of all extra cost, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were more than 1%.

How about a moderate increase to 5 MB. I fully agree that an increase to 20 MB is just overkill and risky. If implemented well, it should be easier to scale to larger blocksizes after the first increase to 5 MB.
An increase of 1 MB per year seems a bit too small - if volume spikes, 2 MB blocks do not really help much. A linear increase also seems too slow for Bitcoin which can grow exponentially. An increase of 40% per year (amounting to close to doubling the max block size every two years) would be a good option IMO. The advantages of a gradual predefined increase are obvious: no sudden big increase, predictable, and no forking.
So, to 5 MB now, followed by a 40% per year increase.

This "transaction" would not appear on the blockchain.
My scenario:
Bob creates an signed transaction at block 400,000 that is valid until block 400,000 + 48 hours and sends it to Alice by e-mail.
If Alice submits the signed transaction to the network within 48 hours, then the transaction is treated as a regular valid transaction. If the transaction is submitted later, it is rejected and never makes it into the blockchain.
So you can hand people fully signed transactions, that must be submitted before a certain point in time, or else they become invalid and worthless.
Of course, nothing prevents Alice to put the transaction on the network ("submit the voucher") without actually using the voucher as intended. For instance, the transaction could be a voucher for a free beverage when ordering a meal in a restaurant. But Alice can "submit" the voucher even when not in the restaurant. The issuer of the transaction cq. voucher now compensates the restaurant for a beverage that has never been ordered.

This is awesome. Now take Bitcoin wallets to the next level!
*Feature requests*
* Standardize HDM across wallets, such that the same "master seed" restores exactly the same HDM wallet on every wallet implementation.
* Wallet compatibility. So a 2-of-n multisig transaction can be signed with any combination of two HDM wallets. For instance - with Breadwallet and Bither. Or with my Trezor and Hive.
* Standardized wallet configuration. Each wallet implementation should consist of a pair of wallets: one multisig and one singlesig. The multisig "bank" wallet is for storing large amounts. The singlesig hot wallet acting as a "daily use wallet" and holds smaller amounts only. The "bank" wallet should have a configurable daily withdrawal limit, and perhaps other fund access limitations as well, enforced by the blockchain. Limitations to access to the "bank" wallets' funds can only be lifted by using a separate seed that is stored offline. This "override seed" should be derived from the master seed.
The effect of this standardization will be that almost everyone will be using this same safe setup. Regardless of wallets used, the wallet mechanics are the same for everyone, so a user has to learn this only once. Experienced users that are familiar with these mechanics can answer questions of less experienced users, regardless of which wallet implementation is used. Best practices are baked into this wallet mechanics software layer.

A twenty-fold increase of the average size of a block would require a 13 mbit/s sustained bandwidth and would send about 1.8 TB per month. That would be the end of running a node at home.
Here's how I got to these numbers:
Have a look at the bandwidth stats of this full node:
As you can see, this full node sends over 3 GB per day, 90 GB per month, or over 40KB/s or 320 kbit/s sustained upstream.
Now multiply these numbers by 20. That would mean over 60 GB per day, 1.8 TB per month, over 800 KB/s or 6.4 mbit/s sustained.
That is on *average*. If you look at the stats, some days are over double that. These peaks also needs to be supported. A 20-fold increase would therefore mean that this node would require 13 mbit/s sustained bandwidth upstream, to be able to support Bitcoin as much as it does today.
EDIT: corrected some numbers.

Yes. To continue where you stopped:
As soon as 75% of the hash power follows Classic, Bitcoin Core will be forced to change the PoW algorithm for their chain (that is: the blockchain limiting blocks to 1 MB in size.)
This is to prevent [51% attacks]( and it will also reset the difficulty as mining blocks will have slowed to a crawl due to all the hash power that has left.
The change of PoW algo renders existing mining hardware useless for Bitcoin Core. However it can be used perfectly fine to mine Bitcoin Classic. Miners cannot go back to mine for Bitcoin Core. Once a hardfork occurs and the PoW algo changes, hash power can only be used to mine Bitcoin Classic BTC.
So after the fork there will be two flavors of Bitcoin: the original Bitcoin Core BTC and Bitcoin Classic BTC, each being traded at some value at exchanges.
What these values would be at that point is anyone's guess, but due to the chaos it will not be much especially compared to current levels.

What are the incentives for miners to implement soft caps? The more transactions they include in a block, the more fees they earn.
And it needlessly introduces another risk: that of your assumption that miners would implement soft caps being wrong.
If the protocol introduces a modestly growing max block size such that nodes have a chance to keep up in terms of bandwidth, then a sudden decrease of the number of nodes becomes very unlikely.
I think Bitcoin is better off supporting slower growth of the maximum number of transactions it can support in favor of avoiding centralization because the number of nodes heavily dropping.

That's only half the story. Security is also related to the value of the reward. If the cost of finding a block were low, but the reward as well, then the network would still be perfectly secure.
If the cost of finding a block became too high relative to the reward, the hash rate would drop. This wouldn't make the network less secure however.

I theory it i think it should be possible to fix a fiat amount of bitcoin using future contracts. Since a small chance of a bubble is priced into futures, these futures are favourable as in you get more fiat than you buy bitcoin at the regular exchange rate. However in case the exchange holding the future contracts defaults, the money is gone (counterparty risk).
Such scheme would not be easy to implement - it would require a wallet to automatically find the contracts that would insure the fiat amount and do the trading as well. The end user would benefit - she'd just see "cost: $50, bitcoin value: $55, value locked for for 2 weeks."

Since the Bitcoin Core software is heavily reviewed and therefore can be assumed to operate honestly, it might as well include a hardcoded value being the hash of the most recent block right before it was released and skip all validations prior to that block.

Yes. It sets Bitcoin apart from countless other payment processors that all require trust.


There are no clients. Bitcoin software is peer-to-peer, there is no central server to which any clients connect. Bitcoin has *nodes* that participate in the protocol on equal footing.
Nodes enforce the consensus rules of Bitcoin. Consensus rules must absolutely be consistent in deciding whether a transaction or block is valid. If not, an unintended hard fork can occur.

"I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network."

Transactions become stuck when blocks become full. Therefore the root problem are ofcourse these spam transactions which are pushing out legitimate transactions. I suppose we can agree so far?
Now I hope you can also agree that it costs nothing to spam the network with zero-fee transactions, causing them to become stuck. It will cost very little to add low-fee transactions so they can become stuck as well.
I suppose the only measure that miners can take is to temporarily stop adding zero-fee and low-fee transactions. There is no foolproof way of knowing which transactions are spam and which are not, so that's why legitimate zero-fee and low-fee transactions will also become stuck as a result.
The wallet makers should recognize busy conditions and automatically offer anyone making a transaction to input a higher fee. Just present the user with two simple options: low fee, high fee. Show the fee amounts, and the expected next block. Wallet makers really can do a lot to battle the spam problem with this simple logic, which would give legitimate transactions the option to outprice spam transactions and be quite sure they don't get stuck, defeating the spam attack in an elegant way.
2 MB blocks will do nothing to prevent this attack, as about 60% of the transactions in blocks is already spam. It just means a blockchain growing twice as fast, as well as straining full nodes more heavily, with all the dangers involved (less nodes, more centralization).


That's incorrect. Spam transactions can't just be pruned as if they never happened. It's not like a spam e-mail that you can just delete. The integrity of the blockchain demands that the result of each and every spam transaction is retained and represented correctly by the blockchain.

I am only showing what would happen if blocks were twenty times the size of today. I understand very well that raising a limit will not cause blocks to become 20 times as big overnight.
However, if there is no need for 20 MB capacity today, then why provide it now? It needlessly opens Bitcoin up to the following risks:
* Fast large scale adoption causing the number of transactions to explode and overwhelm the bandwidth capacity of most nodes, leaving Bitcoin centralized because few nodes are left, exactly at a moment when Bitcoin is in the limelight and will have the full attention of many governments. Absolutely a situation to avoid. If fast adoption were to happen, I'd rather see it slowed down because of block size constraints such that most nodes will be able to keep running.
* Induced demand: a large block size might attract Bitcoin-alien data in the blockchain (for instance storing images, videos, texts, proofs of existence etc.) that are perceived to be feasible given the 20 MB block size.

Not sure if I follow. There originally was a single blockchain. But suddenly Mallory maliciously creates a second blockchain with some data altered. How to know which one is the original blockchain?
There is no way of telling by just looking at the blockchains. So the blockchain cannot be an immutable ledger if it stands on its own.
With PoW, it can at least be made harder to recreate the blockchain from scratch, however as you point out, that won't really work either.

With full reserve banking, the fiat of depositors can not be used by the bank for financing anything. It just sits in a safe until it is withdrawn.
Given the near zero interest rates that banks offer, I don't see why anyone can agree to fractional reserve banking where your money is gambled with, without giving a proper reward for the risk YOU as a depositor incur. This only persists because there are no viable alternatives to current banks, yet.

It's not like that. If miners chose to mine Bitcoin Classic with 2 MB blocks, there equipment will remain perfectly usable for that purpose.
In order to prevent [51% attacks]( Core will be forced to change the PoW algo. That is purely a necessary defense measure.
The consequence is that miners cannot change their mind and go back mining for Core using existing hashing equipment.
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:40:04
It's great to see Core devs already proactively handling the possibility of a hardfork. If the miner majority rallies behind a fork such as Bitcoin Classic, then the Core devs will be forced to change the PoW algorithm. That is to prevent Core from [51% attacks]( as there will be little hash power left mining for Core.
It also means that there is no going back to mining Core once a hardfork gains a majority of the hashing power. After the change of the PoW algo the existing mining equipment can never again be used for mining Core. So a decision to mine a hardfork means commiting the investment of the mining equipment to a hardfork and its dev team. The stakes are high.
Lastly, it indicates that Core devs are prepared to commit to Core even after a hardfork which rallies most of the mining power behind it.

Segwit is a great test for Bitcoin. Segwit has overwhelming support of the Bitcoin devs and most of the community.
Miners will soon find that they can't have it both ways. They can't block changes that have community support and at the same time expect the community to hold on to a coin that they sabotage.
Bitcoin is about trust and correctly stacked economic incentives. If miners choose to sabotage progress, trust will be violated which will cause the price to drop.
Right now Bitcoin enjoys near record highs, but this will change rapidly if miners continue to violate the decentralized principles of Bitcoin and try to exert control. I believe that this will become painfully clear rather sooner than later.
And that is why Bitcoin works - miners will be forced to follow the wishes of the Bitcoin community or else they'll soon be left mining a worthless coin.

A price drop from ~450 to ~430 happened two of days ago, exactly when Gavin Andresen announced Bitcoin Classic. A similar sudden price drop also occurred at the time when Bitcoin XT was announced.

It is bad. Very bad. It pollutes the blockchain with data that has nothing to do with bitcoin-the-currency. Node operators, who are supporting Bitcoin mostly altruistically may not be so willing to be abused by a commercial company, especially not one that is part of the corrupt finance system.
If too many transactions on the blockchain exist for the benefits of commercially operating companies at the expense of altruistically operating nodes, I predict a dramatic drop in the number of nodes and thus centralization. Only those commercial companies that stand to gain from the blockchain will see a need to run a node. First-hour enthusiast will have turned away from what will have become bitcoin-the-notary and for the first time, a new cryptocurrency may have a real chance to seriously compete with Bitcoin.

Yes. Whoever produces the cheapest hashes wins. That's because the automatic difficulty adjustments which make it more expensive to hash.

Actually this attack shows that blocks might be *too big*. Spam transactions should be uneconomical to perform. By making blocks smaller, an attack like this would become more expensive because it would have to outbid transactions having fees higher than they are now.

Very, very disingenuous.
This is not a resource issue. This is a fundamental property of Bitcoin: the longest chain obeys a single set of consensus rules consistently. As soon as a block is created which is accepted by implementation A but rejected by implementation B, there will be a fork of the blockchain. The losing implementation will get badly burned and obviously Bitcoin as a whole will too.
I don't understand what your agenda is other than creating controversy and infighting. The Core developers have recently reached consensus on the capacity increase issue and have moved on.
Good luck with your divisive 2 MB block size implementation - I am pretty confident it will not be adopted by Core any time soon because of the dangers of increased centralisation which is an existential risk to Bitcoin.

If it [turns out] that Classic takes off — everybody’s running Classic — and if there’s a hard fork on the road, I think Core would probably need to follow because I think Core won’t risk splitting the whole community. But that’s my personal opinion; I don’t want to say that for every Bitcoin Core developer."

Ok, it is just semantics. I would say that functional properties define Bitcoin and the technical implementation is irrelevant.

That is impossible. There can only be one Bitcoin at any one time. A fork of Bitcoin that creates blocks using alternate consensus rules is an altcoin.

That would make fees higher than need be for everyone, all the time.
There is no need to do so. The wallet software can dynamically suggest a higher fee at busy times (in this case caused by a spam attack). It is then up to the user to decide on the priority their transaction should have. A user that is ok to wait a few hours just puts a standard, low fee. A user who wants their transaction confirmed in the next block can use a higher fee.
The wallet software is to calculate the fees for these two cases and present the user with a choice on which fee to use.

@_date: 2016-01-29 23:29:36
With all due respect Eric, your analogy is flawed on many many levels.
The most obvious one is that your island community seems to consist out of equaly skilled engineers, whereas any person within the Bitcoin ecosystem can wear one or more of the following hats: scientist, engineer, developer, miner, end-user, facilitator, regulator, journalist, opinioner or saboteur.
The TeamWater and TeamShelter are the ones building key infrastructure required for survival in your example. Applied to Bitcoin that would mean the scientists, engineers and developers working on Bitcoin Core. So both TeamWater and TeamShelter are part of Bitcoin Core. Since Core agreed with consensus on a scalability roadmap, there exists no contention like there is between TeamWater and TeamShelter.
You keep painting the Bitcoin community as a homogeneous group where each member is entitled to an equal vote in any design decisions. But that is not how Bitcoin Core is governed. There is a small group of decision makers which in principle anyone can join but only after having demonstrated the required skills. That generally means contributing to Core by implementing enhancements or new ideas that benefit Bitcoin Core. That also means that other groups in the ecosystem (miners, end-users, facilitators, regulators, journalists, opinioners and saboteurs) have no vote in any design decisions. They can float ideas by using the BIP process but ultimately Core always has the final say.
And that is how Bitcoin Core is governed. These governing principles are integral part of Bitcoin.
There are also other governing models such as letting the community vote on every design decision like Bitcoin Classic proposes. This seems democratic but I don't think it can work for various reasons. But all the best to them - if it indeed turns out to be a better way to govern a cryptocurrency project then that will become apparent sooner or later as it will empower them to create software superior to Bitcoin Core.
What cannot be done however is change the governing model of Bitcoin. It is integral part of Bitcoin, it is one of its defining properties.

Great analysis. I may add that a blockchain without PoW is not immutable. If the goal is to create an immutable ledger or information store, then there must be also a PoW be involved. If not, anyone can just recreate the entire blockchain from block 1 with altered data in an instant and claim that it is the original data. There is no way to proof them wrong.

The current governing model where hundreds of people contribute brought us where we are today.
It is not clear to me how Bitcoin Classic will be governed, but from the looks of it they seem to want to govern it not on technical merit but by popular vote. No one except themselves can know how they will govern it going forward. They may as well turn into some central planning committee.

The Core devs do not have such monopoly power at all, that is a misconception. If they'd create a patch which doubles the number of bitcoin overnight, it would simply be disregarded. Their power may be strong but it is absolutely not a monopoly.
Gavin is free to join the Core dev team again and convince them of the need for 2 MB blocks. Instead he choses to go his own way tries to rally miners behind him who have their own reasons for supporting big blocks.
Bitcoin Classic does nothing but to create renewed division and sends a vote of no-confidence to the Core devs. That is really what this is about.

Miners will extend what they consider to be the longest *valid* chain.
Miners that consider Bitcoin Core as the real Bitcoin will consider the Bitcoin Classic chain as invalid as soon as it contains a block larger than 1 MB. Bitcoin Classic miners may continue to extend their blockchain, but Bitcoin Core miners will consider the 2 MB block and any blocks after it as invalid. As far as the Core nodes are concerned, the transactions in the 2 MB Classic block never occurred.
There are now two chains: one with blocks of max 1 MB which is considered the longest valid chain by Bitcoin Core, and a longer chain which also contains a block larger than 1 MB which is considered to be the longest valid chain by Bitcoin Classic but which is rejected by miners adhering to the Bitcoin Core rules.
So again, it is about longest *valid* chain.
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:05:54
As a member of the community myself I can assure you that I will no longer be hodling if the current Core devs call it quits and Classic takes over. For me, Bitcoin equals Bitcoin Core and is developed and governed by the current Core devs and BIP process.
If changes can enter Bitcoin against the will of the Core devs by rallying users and miners than that would set a deadly precedent. I don't think that such mechanics form a healthy governing model. In fact, yes the sky would be falling indeed and I am convinced that it will be the sad end for Bitcoin.
The current development governing model created a 6 billion dollar currency and that is the only model I entrust my money to. Be prepared to see the price tank more as the contention grows, because I am not alone in my point of view.
I don't expect the Core devs to bend and stick in 2 MB blocks into Core because of the deadly precedent it sets. It would be a departure from the current successful governing model.
Instead I am quite sure that the Core devs will continue to develop on Core and implement their scalability roadmap which has consensus amongst them.

So do I, but for quite different reasons.
I fully expect this threat of a bail-in to trigger bank runs, first for weak banks, then spreading out to other banks as well.
It increases the risk of systemic failure, as no bank has the liquidity to make good on all depositors and will go down when too many of them try to withdraw their funds in order to prevent being "bailed-in" or I would rather say get royally screwed in all holes.
An insolvent bank going down will have the taxpayer on the hook anyway to make good on the banks' shortfall.
Why is this good? Because it will demonstrate the inability of legislators to prevent socialized losses and highlights that a fundamentally different way of approaching banking is dearly needed.

You're basically advocating that the Bitcoin community should never try to solve problems like this.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:30:53
Your analysis is decent but misses some important points.
First of all, miners are merely given the opportunity to *signal* that they are ready to support segwit. Miners are just a tiny fraction of the total Bitcoin ecosystem and have a very specific task which is to create valid blocks that define the Bitcoin transaction history. Bitcoin uses the BIP process for protocol improvements. Proposals are peer reviewed and accepted if deemed an improvement by the community.
The current situation in which a couple of miners can seemingly block changes that the community at large is in favor of (i.e. segwit) is very dangerous and absolutely unacceptable. By repeatedly doing so miners would gradually extend their power over Bitcoin by selectively supporting only changes that increases their power while blocking any changes that decreases their power up to a point that BTC becomes MinerCoin, fully centralized and thus literally worthless.
Negotiating a compromise with miners means trashing the community driven BIP process and allowing miners to push their specific interests which are different from the interests of the community at large.
There cannot be any negotiation or compromise - the result will be that in the future miners will be sabotaging *any changes* that are going against their interests, to the detriment of the entire Bitcoin community.
Miners are free to point their equipment to alternative cryptocurrencies such as BU. Bitcoin will have to change its PoW algorithm which is not easy but an unfortunate necessity - but at least we can all move on afterwards.

No they won't. No single entity can dictate the consensus rules enforced by nodes. This is fundamental to Bitcoin and it is what makes it decentralized.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:36:32


Yes, sure he can, but that doesn't gain him anything. Nodes will look for the corresponding public key to decrypt the nonce that was signed with the private key. The nodes will only accept a public key it can by associated with the manufacturer for instance because the key was published on their public website.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:37:03
Any hardfork will announce itself weeks if not months before actually happening. Bitcoin Core has ample time to take the necessary measures to protect their chain carrying their consensus rules.
Once a supermajority of the mining power supports an alternate set of consensus rules implemented outside Bitcoin Core, what will happen is quite predictable. Quoting Gavin:


I agree with the great analysis of Gavin here. These measures are necessary to protect Bitcoin Core. But he goes on to say this:


Although the changes are significant on a technical level, on a functional level they do nothing more than to negate the functional changes caused by the supermajority of the mining power migrating away to a competing set of consensus rules. They do in no way change the fundamental properties of Bitcoin Core. The changes attempt to revert Bitcoin Core to the same *functional* state as before the hardfork. To call this the equivalent of creating an altcoin is somewhat disingenuous, although both coins will claim to be the real Bitcoin and regard the other coin to be the altcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:15:13


I think it is a bit premature to call victory. Bitcoin Classic has not published any code yet and hashers cannot point their equipment towards pools mining ClassicCoin as they don't exist.

**On the contrary**.
I am saying that self-mining manufacturers are *unavoidable*, **not** that they are desirable.

I like the idea however I'm afraid that the ability to select specific miners is not a net benefit.
First of all, it would complicate using Bitcoin - most endusers don't and shouldn't care about mining, let alone be asked to select a miner.
Secondly, fees are only a small part of the income for miners. The small portion of users that would take the trouble of redirecting away their transactions will not make a significant impact on fee income, let alone total income.

Some will, because it is no longer the Bitcoin they envision.


They committed to a scalability roadmap and increasing the max block size to 2 MB is not in there for the near future.

@_date: 2016-01-16 16:58:57


The problem is that when Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic are both in use, there are effectively two BTCs. The Bitcoin Core BTC with block sizes of a maximum of 1 MB, and the Bitcoin Classic BTC having a longest chain which includes one or more blocks larger than 1 MB.
Miners will be forced to decide which fork to continue mining on. Both Core and Classic BTC will each be traded for a particular value on exchanges. An economically rational miner will mine the BTC which trades at the highest value. So ultimately it is the market that will decide which BTC will prevail.

No, that is false. The theft was possible because Bitgo was configured to blindly auto-sign any Bitfinex multisig transactions, which is equivalent to having no multisig at all.

Why not start at 5 MB and increase 40% per year for the next 20 years?
Edit: and ideally, double the block frequency, as well. So, 2.5 MB blocks, 1 per 5 minutes. Plus the yearly 40% increase.
Why? Because such an increase seems to be the max of what is technically feasible without causing centralisation for many years going forward.
If this scheme is still not enough at some point in time, then Bitcoin is growing too quickly and will need alternatives (sidechains / lighthouse) to accomodate more transaction volume. Bigger blocks will not be the solution because it would carry the danger that it causes more centralisation than can be healthy for Bitcoin.
If alternatives are not available, then at some point blocks will be large enough to support the higher volumes thanks to the 40% yearly growth (which is a doubling every two years).
Why 40%? Because it is below the growth rate of Moore's "law", and *seems* achievable, although Moore's "law" sadly can't go on forever.

ASICs are a good thing. It discourages maliciously installed mining software.
When PC mining was still feasible, mining software got maliciously installed on routers, NASses, hacked PCs, computers of employers, smartphones, botnets etc. etc.
Currently thanks to ASICs, the hash rate is at a level where it no longer makes sense even if you could get thousands of PCs mining for you. It's one less thing to worry about. It is a good thing.

I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with you again, although there is some subjectivity. From my point of view, Bitcoin is not defined by technology, but by its defining principles. The most important *to me* is that Bitcoin is *peer-to-peer* cash. Peer-to-peer demands Bitcoin to be trustless and thus decentralized, and offers Bitcoin its censorship resistant properties. These are the properties in Bitcoin that *I* value the most.
Bitcoin Core seems committed to these properties as they prioritize decentralization over capacity. That is important to me, and I will hodl my coins as long as they are in charge. As soon as a team with a different view takes over, for instance one that favors capacity increases over decentralization too much to my liking, I will sell my coins or switch to a coin by developers which have their priorities in line with what I am comfortable with.
Now as I indicated there is a bit of subjectivity. Other people may favor a coin which favors higher capacity at cost of risking more centralization. I am fine if they switch to Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited or whatever. What I do not understand is the pressuring of Bitcoin Core devs into making changes any *they* deem necessary. I am sorry to say that this is also what I see you do - you are asking Bitcoin Core to "listen to the community" and increase the block size limit to appease them. At that point the discussion immediately becomes political in nature, which is exactly what needs to be avoided at all cost. Because, who is "the community"? How can they ever reach consensus as the community is not a homogenous group but consists of many factions having various differing interests? It only but invites politicking.
Harsh as it may sound, to me Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency in which the community have no deciding voice in how Bitcoin Core evolves. It is up to the discretion of the Core devs, and to me that is how Bitcoin should be governed. It is a simple measure that puts the decision making power into the hands of the most experienced and technically versed people, and it avoids politicking the debate.
This may sound like the Bitcoin Core devs are some central authority and Bitcoin is already centralized. However that is not the case as anyone being sufficiently skilled can become a Core dev, and even non-developers can contribute by means of submitting BIPs or even float ideas on Reddit or other forums where Core devs are actively posting. The excellent transparency of the Core dev team offers me a way to verify whether Bitcoin Core is upholding the ideals I value.
So in short, it would be great if we can keep politics out of Bitcoin. If you want politics, then join Bitcoin Classic or hire developers and start your own coin. But don't try to morph Bitcoin into something else. It is what it is, and that includes how it is governed, for better or for worse.
And thanks for the beer.

If such scenario would come to pass, the division amongst developers and the then *two* Bitcoin communities will be enormous.
It is an absolute nightmare scenario in which confidence in Bitcoin will be lost and both flavors of Bitcoin will be trading at a price one or two orders of magnitude lower than today.
No matter which flavor prevails, the entire Bitcoin community will lose and it will take years to recover.
I am optimistic though and think it will not come that far. Once the contention and infighting starts to sink the price, consensus will be sought and found.

Of course, and these capacity issues are inherent to the design of Bitcoin. A fully trustless settlement system such as Bitcoin is not scalable. It is not possible to record each and every coffee purchase on the blockchain where it will sit for all eternity.
Fortunately a payment layer such as LN lets Bitcoin scale at a very small compromise to trustlessness.

Being able to send Bitcoin and withdraw as fiat from a nearby ATM while abroad is a *killer app* no less, if done right.
Withdrawing your own money from an ATM in a foreign currency is costly:
* Your bank charges a fixed fee for each withdrawal;
* You get an unfavorable exchange rate which adds a few percent to the cost;
* The local bank may charge an additional fee;
* In some countries the amount that you can withdraw is lower than USD 100, which magnifies the fixed fees.
Ideally, I'd:
* Open some app on my smartphone;
* It tells me where the closest place is where I can pick up cash;
* Send Bitcoin;
* Go pick up the cash minutes later.

I am impressed more by code that is out there and working in the real world such as the contributions of the Core devs and numerous companies, notably Bitpay and wallet developers such as Trezor, Mycelium, Breadwallet and so on who add tremendous value to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I respectfully disagree.
Layer 1: Bitcoin Core (settlement layer);
Layer 2: Side Chains, Lightning Network, payment channels.
Suppose that Side Chains fails. Then Lightning Network, payment channels and Bitcoin Core are unaffected.
A better analogy is that Bitcoin Core is more like a fertile ground, where the seeds of layer 2 technologies are sown. Some seeds fail, others succeed. All we have to do is to ensure that the fertile ground remains fertile regardless of what seeds are sown.

Bitcoin can't afford its progress to be slowed down by parties with a hostile agenda and deceptive tactics.
Rising fees create demand for cheap and fast transactions. Segwit enables these so it is important that it gets activated. Second layer solutions building on top of the settlement chain are crucial. 
Generally, I believe that delays to activate obvious improvements will harm trust in Bitcoin and strengthen its competitors.

As an additional advantage, the BTC remains invisible for the bank and government agencies that banks report to.

Good point. That can be resolved however by demanding that the block solution (the nonce that starts with a bunch of zeroes) contains an ID which identifies the ASIC hardware.
So instead of a nonce starting with all zeroes, nodes demand that the nonce is of the form:
Now ASICs can no longer substitute each other because they produce different nonces.

I'm afraid that it is not at all ridiculous and Bitcoin Classic is really an altcoin relative to Bitcoin Core. The consensus rules of Classic are different to that of Core. If both Core and Classic are going to exist simultaneously, then there will be two Bitcoins claiming to be the real Bitcoin. There can be only one Bitcoin - any coin that has differing consensus rules will be creating an alternate blockchain.
Obviously Classic is divisive and once again an attempt to sideline Core developers who are not going to adopt 2 MB blocks now that they have committed to a scalability roadmap that finally has consensus amongst them.
Classic does nothing but to stir up controversy and endless debates and erodes the confidence in Bitcoin in general.

I don't see it... what would a miner spoof?
Let me go over it in more detail.
A miner would produce a nonce that identifies the manufacturer by its ID. Instead of having only leading zeroes, it would start with an ID. Something like:
8d40 0000 ... 0000 048f 6ad1 0d62 ... 
And this nonce is calculated just like it is now:
nonce = SHA256(SHA256(blockhash))
The 12-bit "8d4" uniquely identifies the manufacturer. They can pick any ID themselves as long they make sure no one else has it.
Nodes now know the ID of the manufacturer.
Ofcourse this is not good enough: a miner having a lot of hashpower can conceal this by making ASICs that produce a nonce that starts with the ID of that of a competitor. So somehow we need to force the manufacturer to use only its own ID.
So that's why we let the ASIC sign the nonce with a private key.
Manufacturers publish a public key for their ID. Nodes therefore have a list of pairs like this:
(manufacturer-ID, public key)
When a block is found, nodes receive a nonce as well as an encrypted nonce. A node now has:
* The manufacturer ID in the first 12 bits of the nonce;
* A public key published by this manufacturer;
* An encrypted nonce.
The node now uses the public key to decrypt the encrypted nonce and verifies if it is equal to the nonce. If this is the case, then this proofs that the private key of the manufacturer was used to encrypt the nonce.
Since the private key is only known to the manufacturer, this proofs that the ASIC that found the block was produced by the manufacturer.
Since nodes can now discriminate between manufacturers, they now also have the power to selectively reject blocks based on manufacturer. This power ensures that manufacturers will not act against consensus. They'd risk their business by doing so - nodes can start rejecting their blocks selectively.
Now let's look at some ways this scheme might be circumvented. Note that a manufacturer can't just pick the ID of a competitor. Since it does not know the corresponding private key, it can't produce a nonce that can be decrypted with the public key of its competitor. Nodes would therefore reject the block because it will have an invalid encrypted nonce.
Only if the manufacturer learns the private key of its competitor it will be able to spoof a block and hide its hashpower.
However private keys can be stored in a special area of the chip that is resistant to extraction. Also, by changing the key for every new ASIC release, the damage caused by a private key falling in the wrong hands can be further reduced.

That is not true at all. If they'd implement a controversial change, the new version would not get adopted by the community. For example, if the Core devs released a new version which inflates the number of Bitcoin by for instance doubling the block reward then this change would not be adopted by anyone because it would crater the price of Bitcoin.

As soon as one miner accepts a segwit block which is seen as valid by the nodes then anti-segwit miners must have at least 50% of hashpower to be able to overtake and become once again the longest valid chain, orphaning the segwit block.
In other words: once &gt; 50% of the hashpower supports segwit, anti-segwit miners will have to build on top of segwit blocks or else see their blocks orphaned - they will not be able to keep up with the pro-segwit hashpower.

You completely miss the point. Miners are not supposed to go against the consensus like they do now. This is about shifting back the power where it belongs: with the decentralized nodes.
Anyway - it occurred to me that an easier way to shift back power to nodes is by using multiple PoWs that can be shut down selectively. As long as no single manufacturer attains equal market for all PoWs, it will always be possible to shut off PoWs such that the misbehaving centralized self-mining manufacturers are hit the hardest.
This is not as powerful as being able to selectively brick a self-mining manufacturers ASICs, but still a threat big enough to keep any miner from meddling with consensus.

They cannot. Bitcoin Core will reject a block that is larger than 1 MB. Bitcoin Classic will accept blocks sized up to 2 MB.

@_date: 2017-03-25 03:13:45
Doesn't matter. If a node can't find the corresponding public key from a channel controlled by the manufacturer such as their public website then the node will reject the block. So manufacturers will not have any reason to publish many keys.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:06:58


Miners cannot dictate where hashers point their hash power to. I expect Slush and other pools to offer hashers choice whether to mine CoreCoin or ClassicCoin.
So in the end the pools do not decide, it's the owners of hashing equipment who choose what to mine.
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:19:46
Would it be of any help if nodes were able to selectively reject blocks based on the ASIC-chip and by extension the manufacturer that found it?
Then the equipment of a misbehaving miner can be effectively bricked. That threat would ensure each manufacurer to always act in the interest of Bitcoin.
Each manufacturer creates a private key and publishes the corresponding public key. ASICs produced by a manufacturer embed this private key on the chip in a special area that is resistant to key extraction. Secondly, a solution (nonce) of a block must include a manufacturer-ID for instance in its first 12 bits.
If a nonce is found, the ASIC signs it with the on-chip private key of the manufacturer. The nonce in combination with the signed nonce uniquely identify a manufacturer in a way that can't be spoofed.
Alternatively, we can demand a nonce to be encrypted with a private key of the manufacturer, so: nonce = PK(SHA256(SHA256(block hash)))
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:16:03
Still I think that the only way to turn the tables on self-mining ASIC manufacturers is the ability to reject blocks based on the ASIC finding the nonce.
So yeah, on the hardware level. Then, any maliciously operatng self-mining ASIC manufacturer with &gt; 50% hashpower can have its equipment effectively bricked by nodes.
Hashing has fundamental centralizing forces - it is basically winner-takes-all because whoever mines cheapest can push everyone else out of the market.
Multiple PoWs might also be a reasonable way to do this. One miner becoming dominant and adversarial? Just disable the PoW which they have the most hashpower for.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:48:44


Impossible. I propose to give nodes the ability to reject blocks on the basis of the manufacturer of the ASIC.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:53:35
So, you're suggesting that the increase was caused by existing customers?
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:25:57
Mostly false.
If Bitcoin fails, so will Blockstream. The profitability of Blockstream is depending *largely* on the success or rate of adoption of Bitcoin.
As I understand it, their business model is to offer services to companies that wish to use Bitcoin together with their technologies they are adding as a layer on top of Bitcoin. Their approach is similar to that of Redhat who also pays developers for working on Linux.
Having said that, as a for profit company they should be watched closely as their incentives (profit) are almost but not 100% aligned with that of the Bitcoin community who care about value per BTC mostly.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:44:01
It is tricky.
On the one hand, Bitcoin users implicitly subscribe to the ideals and paradigm shift of peer-to-peer electronic cash. That means that if a node would be released having new consensus rules that put these ideals at risk then users will veto and reject such node.
However if users gradually change their ideals and not care so much about Bitcoin being a trustless system but misguidedly want on-chain scaling instead, then *these* users should not be able to block progress and so not be able to veto devs that defend Bitcoins starting points.
A subtle point, not sure if there's any answer.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:16:02
So please tell me - who exactly are miners negotiating with?

Very likely the 74% increase is in USD. In the unlikely case they report in BTC, then the increase in USD would be even larger.

This. Bitcoin is perceived to be stagnating while other coins zoom forward. A lot of crucial improvements require segwit and as long as it's not there, Bitcoin will keep losing market share to coins that keep improving.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:12:35
BitMain is a self-mining ASIC manufacturer, which is why they can mine cheaper than anyone else that they sell their ASICs to for a profit.
The current PoW scheme is inevitably centralizing, and its economics fundamentally guarantee that there will be one dominant self-mining ASIC manufacturer left. To avoid such miner from turning against the network, it must be possible to neutralize such concentration of mining power selectively.
Come to think of it - by being able to identify a miner-manufacturer, nodes would also have the power to rebalance by setting a higher difficulty for ASICs with relatively more hash power, and thus avoid one dominant player from emerging.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:53:46
I actually have no clue why some chinese miners don't support segwit considering the advantages and the potential to propel Bitcoin into the mainstream.
But it's fine - Bitcoin doesn't require the permission of miners to have segwit. It's just going to take a bit longer and is going to be less smooth than it can be, which will cause the price to plummet every once in a while. I guess we'll just have to deal with that in the name of antifragility.

The money spent on mining is proportional the value of its token. The token having the most value will attract the most hashing power.
Miners can't afford to mine a token that doesn't pay their electricity bills and investments in equipment.

Segwit has overwhelming support with most parties Bitcoin within the ecosystem with miners being the notable exception. They are subsequently abusing their mining power by attempting to stall segwit. Although not as serious as a &gt; 50% attack, I would still consider this to be a hostile act by the miners.
I believe that mining centralization is fundamental and there is no way to prevent one ASIC vendor to gain the majority of the hashpower. All hashes are equal except for the cost to produce them which means that whoever can produce hashes the cheapest will eventually push everyone else out of the market due to the very nature of PoW.
Self-mining with their own ASICs is the most profitable by running their own rigs at places with cheap electricity.
Now let's put technicalities aside and assume that we can identify the ASIC hardware vendor by examining a block. In other words: the mining hardware and ASIC chip that found a block can be extracted from the block somehow.
This would enable nodes to dismiss blocks on a per vendor basis. For instance, today might want to release a version that renders all blocks found by BitMain invalid.
Nodes and by extension the parties that define Bitcoin consensus being able to brick mining rigs on a per-vendor basis would keep any mining vendor from wielding its hashpower and go against consensus, like they go against segwit today.
Your thoughts on this would be appreciated!
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:59:31
Why would users give a shit about a high hash rate? A new PoW will be comparably secure even if the hash rate is much lower.
What matters is that the block reward attracts an amount of mining power so large that it becomes uneconomical to attack.

No they cannot. Bitcoin will reject blocks that are invalid, as BU found out recently when a BU miner created a block bigger than 1 MB in size. Also, it is impossible for miners spend any random coins if they don't have the private key.


No, really they cannot. Nodes would reject blocks that meddle with the coinbase reward.


That's false too. Nodes decide what blocks are valid. Miners just order transactions.

Bitcoin is de facto defined as the coin with the current 100+ dev team behind it.

I'm afraid you are conflating PoW change due to miner centralisation and PoW change after a successful hardfork of Bitcoin Classic meaning 75% of all hash power migrated away from Core and moved to Classic.
The discussion above was about miner centralisation.
If more than 75% of hash power would abandon Bitcoin then a change of PoW is inevitable to protect itself against [51% attacks]( However Bitcoin Classic is not regarded to be a threat so no action is required at this point.

Please stop spreading misinformation. Segwit is not controversial. All Bitcoin Core developers support it and so does most of the participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The only group not on board are miners which fear that the improvements that Segwit brings might hurt their income.
UASF and PoW change are needed to get around miners blocking segwit and to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack as miners are now acting against the interests of Bitcoin.
BU wants to become Bitcoin and replace the Core team having 100+ active contributors with a team of 5-6 devs that have proven to be unable to release a stable client. It's hostile towards the Bitcoin community that wants to stick with Core which is the overwhelming majority.
Are you a paid shill? Just asking.

Bitcoin can never compete with the likes of Visa and Paypal in volume if it settles each transaction on chain. An off-chain scaling solution such as Lightning Network is required.
Also note that it is not a fair comparison. Paypal, Visa etc. don't ever really settle - it's all electronic bookkeeping and cash is never exchanged. Bitcoin on the other hand settles each transaction irreversibly in cash - because that's what Bitcoin offers: peer-to-peer cash transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:15:13
This is very interesting. Let's see what Mike has to say:


My guess is that miners took a hint from the sliding price and dismissed XT in favor of Core to end the controversy. After that, the price drop indeed stopped and shortly after rallied from 250-300 to stabilize at over 400.


This statement speaks for itself. Clearly, miners do not want controversy and want Core to take decisions. That makes all the sense in the world as controversy sinks the price of Bitcoin which in turns sinks their profit.


Note that miners shot down KnC on a *private* e-mail thread. So, other miners sticked to Core when KnC expressed their support for Classic.


Mike is suggesting here that the price started sliding because other miners did not support KnC in a *private* thread e-mail thread. How then would these sellers know about the position of other miners? Much more likely the price started sliding because of the *public* announcement by KnC.


Miners were adamantly opposed to Bitcoin XT and clearly expressed their support for Core regardless of what would be in XT. That is a loud and clear message: miners support the Core *dev team*.
It is hard to believe that in mere hours, miners attributed the price drop to their dismissal of Classic which they expressed in a *private* e-mail thread. It is even harder to believe that miners previously dismissing XT would suddenly support Classic.
I am confident that miners will stay behind Core and I like to see Bitcoin Classic as a test to the soundness of the incentives of Bitcoin. Over the course of the last few days I have become convinced that Bitcoin Classic does not stand any chance. The closer it would seem to become reality, the lower the price of Bitcoin would sink. And I don't see miners ruining themselves.

The price collapse also happened to coincide with the announcement of Bitcoin Classic. Even more coincidently, in the past the price also collapsed after the announcement of Mike Hearns' Bitcoin XT.
Mike Hearn is not involved in development in Bitcoin Core. He has a track record of floating dubious ideas of which some reduce financial privacy and some mark and track coins such that they become impossible to spend and lose their value.
Mike now services a consortium of banks on "distributed ledger technology" and declared Bitcoin dead and an idea that cannot work. 
For most the Bitcoin community, he has lost a lot if not all credibility. I don't believe Mike Hearns' backstabbing and ragequitting worries hodlers to a point where they start to sell their coins as his actual contributions to Bitcoin have been fairly insignificant compared to that of the Core devs.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:28:49
The backbone of Bitcoin are nodes. They constantly transmit transactions amongst each other. This takes a lot of bandwidth and a fast computer. In other words: money. Someone running a node does not receive any money for it. It is just a cost.
Increasing the number of transactions per second also increases the bandwidth and cpu power required to run a node. The fear is that more people will stop running a node out of cost considerations and Bitcoin becomes dependent on a too small number of nodes. At that point Bitcoin has become centralized.
The number of nodes has been continuously dropping despite increased adoption of Bitcoin. If not enough nodes are left, then it becomes a target to attack Bitcoin as a whole. For instance, by regulation (governmental attack) or by denial-of-service attacks, which would disrupt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:18:04
Strange. When Core devs talk about consensus, they refer to consensus amongst themselves. They do not try to seek consensus with miners, hodlers, node operators, payment processors, VCs, exchanges and other parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The ability to brick the equipment based on manufacturer is a big enough threat that it will never have to be used.

That's correct. But a random person can't create a nonce with embedded manufacturer ID that is a solution to a block.

You can fantasize all day long but Bitcoin by definition is defined as the code base that the 100+ Bitcoin Core devs and scientists work on.

@_date: 2017-03-29 16:43:45
Segwit can no longer be avoided by miners if more than 50% of the hashpower supports it. The 95% is just a safety measure as a courtesy to the miners - they get the chance to signal readiness and only then the protocol switches on segwit. But it is purely a courtesy.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:08:27
So, how about being able to tell which ASIC chip mined a block?
Then the ASIC vendor will have a big incentive to always act in the interest of Bitcoin. If they wouldn't, then nodes have the power to brick equipment of such ASIC vendor by selectively rejecting their blocks.
That would keep ASIC vendors from concentrating their hashpower and use it to sabotage Bitcoin like they are doing today. Also, a 51% attack can be dealt with by rejecting any nodes founf by the equipment of the attacker (ASIC vendor).
Achieved by using cryptographic signing of ASIC hardware in combination with using a special nonce that enables identifying the ASIC chip that found a block.

Another approach would be to somehow incentivize nodes by for instance giving them a piece of the block reward. That however would involve a major change to Bitcoin.
Other approaches that I do not know of may also exist. I am confident that a solution will be found eventually.

It would be impossible for Wu to conceal that the new fake ASIC manufacturer is in fact him. The ASIC chips and circuitry will pretty much identify the manufacturer because of the similarities to Wu's ASICs. The fake manufacturer will have to hide associations with Wu indefinitely because once it is discovered they are in fact Wu, it is game over - this has to be discovered just once.
Besides all that - in case Wu + fake manufacturer join forces to act against the network, then nodes can simply drop both of them.

Multiple PoW algos doesn't address the fundamental problem with mining which is its winner-takes-all nature.
The miner that can hash the cheapest is able to push everyone else out of the market due to the nature of PoW.
Even with multiple PoWs we'd end up with a single hardware manufacturer that bought out all ASIC makers and outcompetes everyone on all PoW algos.

Would it be of any help if nodes were able to selectively reject blocks based on the ASIC-chip and by extension the manufacturer that found it?
Then the equipment of a misbehaving miner can be effectively bricked. That threat would ensure miners to always act in the interest of Bitcoin.
Each manufacturer creates a private key and publishes the corresponding public key. ASICs produced by a manufacturer embed this private key on the chip in a special area that is resistant to key extraction. Secondly, a solution (nonce) of a block must include a manufacturer-ID for instance in its first 12 bits.
If a nonce is found, the ASIC signs it with the on-chip private key of the manufacturer. The nonce in combination with the signed nonce uniquely identify a manufacturer in a way that can't be spoofed.

Any inconsistency in the consensus rules in any implementation that has less than 50% of the mining power will have its blocks orphaned.
Suppose that there is an inconsistency* regarding consensus rules in some alternative node implementation "BitcoinX". 
For example, suppose that MinerX running BitcoinX finds a block, then all nodes running BitcoinX and MinerX have the longest valid chains *from their perspective*. They will proceed to mine the next block on top of their newly found block.
However non-BitcoinX nodes and miners will simply reject MinerX's block - treat it as if it never existed - and keep mining on top of the old block. MinerX may be lucky and even find another block on top of its previously mined block. However given that MinerX has &lt; 50% of the mining power, sooner or later, the rest of the network will have caught up with MinerX / BitcoinX, causing their block or blocks to be orphaned even according to their own consensus rules. Their out of consensus blocks are worthless - the electricity MinerX expended to find them was wasted.
The bottom line is that any difference in an implementation of the consensus rules risks loss of income for any miner that applies them, which is why it does not make sense to have alternate implementations of the consensus rules.
This is not some hypothetical scenario, [Bitcoin Unlimited lost 13.2 BTC this way](
*Note: "inconsistency" - not "bug". A consistently enforced bug becomes a consensus rule - even if it was unintended.

If I would have to come up with ways to attack and ideally kill off Bitcoin, I'd suggest to:
* Sideline the Core devs by creating a hard forked version of Bitcoin. To succeed, this hard fork will have to implement a feature which the community desires but the Core devs refuse to implement. That way, support for such a hard fork can be gathered.
* Attempt to reduce the credibility of Core devs by smearing and character assassination.
* Keep spreading misinformation by repeatedly replying to Core devs postings forcing them to waste time writing lengthy replies.
* Demotivate Core devs by repeated baseless accusations and rude ad hominems.
All of this has been happening, and although conspiracy is a heavy accusation, I consider it a credible explanation to the behavior of a small but vocal group of Redditors.

That's the whole point, isn't it? Miners also include feeless transactions, because they aren't all spam. So a spammer will first fill up blocks as much as possible with feeless transactions, bloating the blockchain. Then, to push out low-fee transactions as well, the spammer just adds additional spam transactions with a marginally higher fee.
Larger blocks would only cause the amount of feeless spam transactions to increase, which don't cost the spammer anything. The result is a blockchain growing twice as fast and blocks filled 80% with spam instead of the current 60%.

ZKCP requires writing a program which is capable of testing the correctness of a solution.
Such a program can also be used to just guess solutions until an answer is found. Therefore, the class of problems for which ZKCP is most useful will be NP-complete, where guessing the solution is infeasible. The Sudoku puzzle by Greg Maxwell in his groundbreaking first ZKCP is such an example.

Let's see first. It's a doubling in capacity. After segwit we can have Schnorr signatures which is another 30% capacity increase. So in total 2.6 times more than today.
Then, with these improvements in place, a doubling of the of the blocksize would increase the capacity to over 5 times from what it is today.
On top of that segwit enables lightning network which can offload transactions from the blockchain as well as open up a whole new spectrum of use cases which are not possible today. Which is actually more important because it has the potential to boost the value of Bitcoin tremendously.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:08:19
I do believe that there are ways, for instance by altering the PoW in a way that forces an ASIC to include information in the nonce that identifies its manufacturer, and signing the nonce with a private key only known to the ASIC / manufacturer.
Nodes can refuse any block that does not uniquely identify the ASIC manufacturer.

Unfortunately the economics of mining comes down to winner takes all.
A hash is a commodity and they are indistinguishable from each other. Hashes all have the same quality. This means that whoever produces the cheapest hashes will eventually push everyone else out of the market as there is only price to compete on.
It is therefore *guaranteed* that sooner or later the same situation will occur again even after a change of PoW.
Hashes should somehow be given a quality that makes it possible for miners to differentiate instead of just competing on price. The economics of hashing must change to get away from the winner takes all situation we have now.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:03:28
It's not about traceability. The sole purpose is to enable rejecting blocks on manufacturer basis.
Being able to do this creates an incentive for miners to make sure that their equipment is not going to be used against the consensus - exactly the reverse as the current situation where a single manufacturer (BitMain) leverages their mining power to sabotage Bitcoin.
Mining has fundamental centralizing forces - the miner that produces the cheapest hashes has the power to push everyone else out of the market by the very nature of how PoW works.
Just changing the PoW will only be a temporary fix. And more disturbingly - how to ensure that sabotaging miners won't be having the most hashpower again right after PoW change? They have the advantage of access to cheap electricity over others already.

Manufacturers publish a public key to nodes (for instance on their website). If they find a block, they sign the nonce with their private key on the ASIC. Since the nonce also identifies the manufacturer, it can not sign a nonce of some other ASIC.
* The nonce is tied 1:1 to the manufacturer of the ASIC, such that the manufacturer can be uniquely identified by just looking at the nonce;
* The nonce is signed by the manufacturers' private key, so that the node will be able to verify that the nonce was indeed found by the manufacturer as encoded within the nonce.


The inability of badminer to sign a nonce with their own private key. The nonce must be signed by the private key of the original manufacturer, or else the manufacturer ID that is embedded in the nonce does not match the public key that nodes must use to decrypt the signed nonce.

Miners have a single function which is defining transaction history. Let's therefore regard miners as a wholistic entity for a moment.
We have to conclude that miners are sabotaging progress of Bitcoin by not supporting segwit. We can see that from the objective fact that SegWit readyness is signalled by only ~30% of all hashpower.
Miners have stopped supporting Bitcoin.
The only logical thing to do is to revert to miners that wish to support Bitcoin. One way of doing this is by resetting the PoW.
Another way would be to allow BitFury and other ASIC suppliers that support segwit a headstart and secretly inform them of a new PoW so that they can have their hardware ready when Bitcoin switches, leaving BitMain in the dust.

Taking their time is fine but it has become clear that a majority of the hashpower is not ever going to signal support for segwit. Segwit has overwhelming support and it is not acceptable that miners stall it. Miners are going against the wishes of most of the community, which means they no longer are supporting Bitcoin. This being the case, changing the PoW is the obvious solution to get fresh miners onboard that will support Bitcoin.

They do - anyone can submit improvements through a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal).


Bitcoin is built on the ideal of being censorship resistant and offer trustless exchange of cash. Bitcoin developers are not interested in accommodating companies that have some business model on top of Bitcoin.


The developers *are* Bitcoin and will pursue their ideals on a voluntary basis. You can bet that many of them don't care that much about the price of BTC. If you use Bitcoin then you subscribe to their vision.
You are so misguided and arrogant to think that the Core devs need to be "guided" through "committees" just because they don't let are themselves being pushed around by angry Reddittors or loud voiced bystanders that never contributed to the project.

Miners represent just a fraction of the Bitcoin ecosystem. As such, they can't be allowed to have veto power over protocol changes.
Bitcoin cannot have itself pressured by miners which are just one of many groups in the Bitcoin space.
We are now in the situation where over 50% of the hashpower is blocking peer reviewed improvements that has wide support of the Bitcoin community.
Not supporting changes such as Segwit by a majority of the hashpower simply means miners are not supporting Bitcoin. Therefore, there is no other option than to change the PoW.
Change of PoW is nothing but a logical answer to miners turning against Bitcoin.
The effect will be that miner equipment becomes useless for mining BTC and likely near worthless. Yes, miners can switch to BU if it sees the light of day but I think it is save to assume that BU will not be worth anything near what Bitcoin is worth. That also means that any value in ASIC designs and production facilities is largely destroyed.
However, if miners are behind BU and believe it will succeed and overtake Bitcoin, then they have no reason to be concerned of any changes in PoW. After all, they can mine BU which they regard to be the real Bitcoin.
A way must be found to prevent the same miners that have a majority of the hashpower today from stocking up on mining equipment and dominating once again after the PoW change.

I'm convinced that the adoption of Bitcoin would increase spectacularly if it behaved like something most people already know: a regular bank account.
This means:
* A single 10 digit number to represent the account.
* Transfer from and to account numbers optionally with or without nickname (anonymous) or name (for instance for companies).
* Transfers to an account are untraceable. Any on-chain transactions should be impossible to link to an account.
* There should be a standard setup for every user: a Wallet and a Bank. The Wallet can be regular wallet software on a phone. The Bank should be 2-factor protected by multisig, and paired to a specific Wallet. It should be effortless to refill the Wallet from the Bank.
Such setup feels familiar and is safe. Also, standardizing a setup such as the above Bank-Wallet pairing means that a lot of people will use the same setup, can share experiences, can help eachother, and can easily find guides on the internet.
My biggest fear is that the usability of Bitcoin remains a challenge for the average Joe. It should be very hard to lose your coins. Failsafe procedures and best practices should be implemented by all wallets. For starters, it would be great if there were a passphrase mechanism that all wallets share. So that  12, 18 or 24 words will recover someones BTC with any wallet.

This could turn out to be a clever embrace and extinguish strategy (which will fail). By offering a alternative, government sanctioned way of holding crypto, the next step can be to outlaw holding crypto outside of the banking system. In some countries such as India, holding cash at home is only allowed up to a certain limit.
In a dystopian future, all money above a trivial amount (be it in cash or crypto) must be in the bank.
This will ofcourse fail because crypto cannot be contained, it is even easier to hide than cash.
Also, I am hoping for wallet technology to become more mature so that anyone can safely hold crypto as easy and user friendly as operating a bank account. Standard best practices that are easy to adopt would help. That would reduce the demand for this abomination of holding crypto in a centralized bank.

The price of BTC has been following the predictions to the outcome of the referendum remarkably close. Since it became apparent that the Brexit camp was going to win, the value of BTC has rebounded from mid-500s to high-600s now.
This is very interesting as this strongly suggests a correlation between the outcome of the referendum. Also, since BTC is up on Brexit winning suggests BTC to be used as a hedge for uncertainty.
These correlations are important for traders that are now learning that BTC can be used as a hedge against market turmoil. That gives them an anchor to trade upon.

In that case, miners must be let go so they can mine their own coin that has the properties they wish for, and Bitcoin can progress as it sees fit.
It's a win-win!

That’s not what’s happening. Adding an extra _decimal_ is like dividing a dollar into 1000 milliDollar instead of 100 cents.
Also, prices don’t change. Something costing 100 satoshi will still cost 100 satoshi after adding decimals. After for instance adding 3 decimals, the price can also be expressed as 100,000 milliSatoshi.

Bank accounts are routinely frozen, banks are forced to police their clients bank accounts to comply with laws and regulations.
Once coins are no longer fungible, something similar could happen to Bitcoin except that instead of banks it will be miners that are forced to comply. For instance, miners may be forced not to process a transaction that moves certain coin, or else face fines or prosecution. Yes, miners exist in multiple jurisdictions and it is not easy to enforce, but so do banks and complete countries and organizations are successfully being cut off from the banking system, worldwide.

 *A* **PEER 2 PEER** *electronic cash system*
The groundbreaking innovation is in Bitcoin being able to transfer cash *peer to peer*. As good as you standing in front of me and handing me cash notes directly, without the cash passing through any third party. Bitcoin can do this and that's why it is trustless. If Bitcoin weren't trustless, it'd be more like [PayPal](
In order to remain trustless, it is essential that Bitcoin remains decentralized. Any centralisation will open it to attacks. Legal attacks may become feasible (for instance, outlawing mining or running a node, which is enforceable if there are only a couple 100). DoS attacks also become easier.
Staying decentralized is therefore essential. Centralisation is an existential risk to Bitcoin. Raising the block size will decrease the already low node count even further. That's why Bitcoin Core devs are reluctant to raise the block size. It may ultimately kill Bitcoin.

The community needs to have more patience. The miners will come around - they will be driven by the price action of BTC.
Because at some point, refusal to support segwit will start to drive the price down. Increasing support will start to move the price up.
If that were not the case, then one can conclude that something is actually wrong with segwit.
For now I believe in the good faith of miners and am convinced that they are simply not yet ready. Once they are, they will signal so. I don't believe they're blocking segwit - that would be against their interests, being a higher price of BTC.

No, it is not. Bcash stress tests have failed to create a single full capacity block. Besides, most of the time, Bcash blocks are near-empty proofing that there is no adoption.
Bitcoin on the other hand is doing great. Version 0.17 has just been released having changes that pave the way for having a single multisig transaction signed by multiple wallets from different vendors. This will remove the reliance on the security of a single wallet which is a massive improvement.
Bcash on the other hand is still based on 0.14 and development has stalled with only a handful people working on it.

Any transaction not intended to transfer BTC. For instance, transactions for the sole purpose of storing data on the blockchain. Or transactions for the sole purpose of broadcasting data.

Generally, the term "PoW algorithm" is understood to be referring to the algorithm that is used to calculate the hash from a nonce.
I see now that indeed a case can be made for considering the difficulty adjustments to be part of the PoW algorithm.
If we assume that segwit2x will not implement any difficulty adjustments then according to this definition, the PoW algos of BTC and segwit2x are the same and the statement of Breadwallet applies.
Perhaps you can answer these questions:
* What will be the behavior of bw if segwit2x only temporarily has the majority of the hashpower? After some hours or days, the Bitcoin blockchain might regain the majority of the hashpower. Will bw switch back to Bitcoin?
* What will be the behavior of bw in case the majority of hashpower keeps switching back and forth between segwit2x and Bitcoin?

Sadly not any longer. According to its CEO u/aaronvoisine it is not guaranteed to follow the Bitcoin blockchain.

After the creation of the segwit2x altcoin in November, breadwallet will potentially be doing segwit2x transactions. In that case you *risk losing your BTC* sitting in the Bitcoin blockchain.
**Move your BTC out of breadwallet before the segwit2x altcoin is created**.
Clarification from breadwallet for the below would be welcomed:
* What will bw do if segwit2x temporarily has the majority of the hashpower? After some hours, the Bitcoin blockchain might regain the majority of the hashpower. Will bw switch back to Bitcoin?
* Which chain will bw follow if the majority of hashpower switches back and forth between segwit2x and Bitcoin a couple of times?
* Will bw switch to start following the bcash blockchain if it gets the majority of the hashpower?

No. Bitcoin is defined by its consensus rules. Parties wishing to transact Bitcoin must all use software that enforce exactly the same consensus rules in order to remain on the same chain. In practice this means that all Bitcoin transacting parties will be running exactly the same Bitcoin software.


By agreeing amongst each other what software they consider to enforce the Bitcoin consensus rules.
Note that anyone is free to decide what software to consider to be "Bitcoin". However, if some party picks software that most of the ecosystem sees as being an altcoin, then that party is defacto on an altcoin chain and will only be able to transact with peers that run the same altcoin software.

I hope you can follow up on the below, because I might be missing something as to me your answers don't make any logical sense.


The btc1 dns seeds are obviously different than the Bitcoin dns seeds. Jonas Schnelli (Bitcoin Core developer) had this damning comment:
"The btc1 dns seed change can tell you a lot. Move away from devs seed (have ackd privacy/neutrality policy) to companies who seek control." ([source](
From your answer I understand that you do not intend to change the DNS seeds breadwallet uses. Please clarify how breadwallet then intends to find btc1-segwit2x nodes.


When deciding what the longest chain is, are you intending to look at bitcoin.org-Bitcoin nodes, btc1-segwit2x nodes or both?
Also note: if difficulty starts to diverge, the longest chain is not equivalent to having the most hashpower. For instance, the BCH chain is now longer than the BTC chain (482167 blocks for BCH vs. 481869 blocks for BTC) but the total of cumulative hashpower is less than that for BTC.


This confuses me. Breadwallet must actively implement to either connect to btc1-segwit2x nodes or bitcoin.org-Bitcoin nodes. Since the two chains will be diverging, switching back and forth between the two networks causes Breadwallet to behave erratically. I'm sure I don't need to explain the weirdness users will experience if Breadwallet will be flip-flopping between two different cryptocurrencies randomly.


Sorry, but this doesn't make any sense. By default, Breadwallet will have to implement whether it will be following the bitcoin.org-Bitcoin chain or the btc1-segwit2x chain. Also, breadwallet must explicitly decide on a symbol to display for each software.
I hope you are not wasting my and everyone's time. If you don't have the technical expertise to answer these questions then do me the respect of asking someone within breadwallet who has.

@_date: 2017-08-25 08:05:21


Ok, clear. So, am I correct to say that:
* Breadwallet continuously monitors both chains to see which one has most cumulative PoW;
* Once the hardfork occurs and the chains start to diverge, the amount of PoW will differ. At that point, Breadwallet switches to whichever coin has the most cumulative PoW.
So right after the fork, Breadwallet is either on the segwit2x chain or the original Bitcoin chain, depending on which chain has the most cumulative PoW. Then:
* Breadwallet continues to monitor both chains to see which one has the most cumulative PoW.
* According to the definition used by Breadwallet, the chain with the most cumulative PoW is Bitcoin. As a consequence, if one chain were to overtake the other in terms of cumulative PoW, breadwallet will automatically switch and change from a wallet of one cryptocurrency into a wallet of another cryptocurrency, both of which it regards to be "Bitcoin".
As a concrete scenario for the last point:
* Hardfork occurs, there is bitcoin.org-Bitcoin and btc1-segwit2x.
* Most of the hashpower migrates to mine btc1-segwit2x.
* Breadwallet becomes a btc1-segwit2x wallet.
* Hashpower returns to bitcoin.org-Bitcoin and it again becomes the chain with the most cumulative PoW.
* Breadwallet automatically switches back to the bitcoin.org-Bitcoin blockchain, and becomes a bitcoin.org-Bitcoin wallet once again.
* During any switches, the user interface will keep "BTC" as a symbol and uses "Bitcoin" to refer to either chain.
Is this correct?

User mjamin hit the nail on the head. 
SegWit2x has no future other than to become an altcoin. Might as well make the split as safe as possible for everyone involved.
The core project will not be coerced to merge SegWit2x's changes without sound reasoning. Core however will move full speed ahead while SegWit2x is stuck on 0.14. This project doesn't have the power to keep up.
What you have is a several months old, non-binding agreement that's starting to fall apart in light of bcash. An agreement among businesses and miners, trying to decide for their customers and the rest of the bitcoin userbase. An agreement that sets a very bad precedence. "Why do we want to hard fork? Because our group agreed on doing that."
But I guess "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."

The hash rate is solely representing the voice of the miners. A change enforced by hashpower and which ignores the rest of the ecosystem is contentious *by definition*.
A system in which miners have the power to set the rules is not Bitcoin. It is an altcoin where nodes lose their function, developers are string puppets of miners and the majority of the Bitcoin economy has no voice.

Segwit already offers twice the transaction capacity, so it makes sense to see how that goes first.
Secondly, larger blocks jeopardize the decentralized nature of Bitcoin because it might bloat the blockchain. The enormous bandwidth requirements - in the hundreds of GB per month already now - might kill off many nodes in the network.
Finally, larger blocks do not really solve the underlying problem that the on-chain transaction capacity can never scale to VISA levels. It is not possible to store every coffee purchase on the blockchain forever. Segwit2x still maxes out at about 15 transactions per second. To be competing in volume with other payment methods, Bitcoin must be able to process tens of thousands of transactions per second. That's simply never going to happen. This is a long way of saying that doing on-chain scaling is not feasible - it doesn't scale. 
Fortunately, not every payment has to be on-chain. With Lightning Network we will soon be able to make small off-chain Bitcoin payments that are instant and nearly trustless. Lightning is a layer on top of Bitcoin and promises to give Bitcoin the transaction capacity boost it needs, as well as enable new applications that were previously impossible.

I wonder if German banks will be allowed to keep a fractional BTC reserve. And if that’s allowed, I wonder if they’d do so.  And if they indeed will be keeping fractional BTC reserves, I wonder by what factor, and what will happen if the price suddenly goes times 10~20.
Offering clients to keep BTC balances only makes sense if the banks can somehow profit from it, and they can only materially profit if they keep a fractional reserve and use the rest for loans.
I suppose it’d allow German banks to extend BTC nominated loans, and even BTC nominated bonds might become available in the far future.
German banks somehow need to manage the risk of holding highly volatile and difficult to secure BTC and still profit from offering this to retail clients. That’ll be a challenge.

No it wasn't, and it is easy to see why.
First of all, on August 1st BIP148 by shaolinfry was activated, forcing miners to signal segwit to avoid the risk of loss of income. For months the miners controlling the majority of hash power had refused to signal. But facing BIP148 they suddenly changed their minds.
Secondly, no agreement such as the NYA is required for doing a hardfork. Miners can do a hardfork at any time.
The people behind the NYA know this too. The goal of the NYA circus therefore seemed purely to deceptively make it look as if a hardfork has wide community support, was the result of some compromise ("we will signal segwit if we can hardfork") and legitimatize it. In reality, their "segwit2x" hardfork as very little support if any at all.
Shills are now spreading the nonsense that "the chain with the most hashing power is Bitcoin". This is ofcourse false and easily refuted. It seems like a desperate attempt to confuse people into believing that miners rule over Bitcoin whereas in reality they have only little power.
I don't think anyone falls for the NYA bullshit, but wanted to reply anyway just to make sure.

Your understanding is objectively wrong and you might want to consult your lawyers because showing Jaxx users a BTC balance that is actually a balance of segwit2x altcoin can be considered fraudulent and is likely to lead to loss of funds for which Jaxx can be held liable.
BTC is the ticker for Bitcoin. There is absolutely no ambiguity about what is meant by "Bitcoin". It is the software that is published by the group of Bitcoin developers commonly referred to as "Bitcoin Core" on the bitcoin.org website. This is what the overwhelming majority of the cryptocurrency community considers to be "Bitcoin".
The NYA represents only a small fraction of the Bitcoin economy. They have failed to convince the cryptocurrency community at large that "BTC" and "Bitcoin" are to be understood as to be referring to the cryptocurrency as implemented by btc1-segwit2x software after activation of segwit2x. It is already clear now that there is hardly any support for that change in definition of "BTC" and "Bitcoin" except for the signatories of the NYA.
Jaxx cannot reasonably claim not to be aware that "BTC" and "Bitcoin" have not changed in definition. Therefore, showing a segwit2x balance as a BTC or Bitcoin balance can be considered neglect and Jaxx can likely be held liable for any damages caused by it.

Breadwallet regards segwit2x to be "Bitcoin" or BTC in case it receives the majority of the hashpower.
Let's assume that segwit2x indeed receives the majority of the hash power. Can you please clarify:
* What will breadwallet report as BTC balance? My segwit2x balance or my original Bitcoin balance?
* If I send coins, will breadwallet be sending segwit2x-coin or my original Bitcoin?
* After receiving segwit2x coins, will breadwallet report them as BTC?

Then clarify here and now:
Assuming that after the launch of segwit2x planned for November, segwit2x obtains the majority of the hashpower.
* Does breadwallet consider the chain extended by segwit2x to be Bitcoin?
* Will breadwallet report coins on the segwit2x chain with the "BTC" token?

If the coin that my node validates the chain for has any value, then there will be a miner mining it. Miners are incentivized to mine blocks for the money in each block in the form of the coinbase reward and fees.

So on the topic of segwit2x I presume...


Some companies and miners had a closed door meeting and decided on the future of Bitcoin for all of us. They agreed comfortably and called it the New-York Agreement or "NYA".
Unsurprisingly, the reception of the NYA was not too positive:
* None of the Bitcoin developers support it ([source](
* Large number of companies never expressed support for it, many of which explicitly reject it ([source](
* Most users reject it ([source](
The point of Rusty Russell is that if consensus is absent, he would loudly oppose pushing through with it, even if he were to be in favor on a technical level.
This is in sharp contrast with the signatories of the NYA that wish to shove segwit2x down the throats of everyone whether they agree or not because they are of the opinion that they rule over Bitcoin.
Luckily Bitcoin is designed such that changes that do not have wide consensus do not stand any chance of succeeding. The signers of the NYA are making a fool of themselves and anyone who supports them will soon find out that their King has no clothes.

Then altcoins go down even faster. Check out the graphs.
As for the few that didn't such as ETH and LTC: they are likely in a bubble. LTC is just a copy of Bitcoin and has nothing interesting to offer technology wise.  There isn't much transaction volume.
ETH is a ticking time bomb and hugely overvalued. It is likely soon to be under scrutiny of the SEC because of the ICOs and suffers from centralized development (Vitalik Buterin) as well as unsound governance by doing a hardfork to recover from a bug in a contract, breaking the selling point that "code is law". Also, it doesn't scale. Bitcoin will be able to do all that Ethereum can do, just more efficiently and clean.
Just be careful and mindful that fortunes can be made with starting an altcoin, which attracts scammers that know very well how to market their coin but hold no technical merit.

No it's not. It is very clear what the majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem regards to be Bitcoin (the software released by the group of developers commonly referred to as Bitcoin Core) and what is regarded to be an altcoin (segwit2x as produced by a company called Bloq which is owned by Jeff Garzik).

Bitcoin futures and options already a huge deal. A Bitcoin ETF would give it a decisive advantage over any other cryptocurrency.

It's relevant regardless because such a big increase is likely to be more than just variance. It looks like that the amount of Segwit voting hash power has measurably and significantly increased.

... BIP148 forced miners to signal segwit readiness.
The narrative that it was the closed-door NYA and the promise of segwit2x that won over miners is just preposterous. Facing BIP148, *100%* of the miners fell in line and started to signal segwit. They would have risked great losses if they hadn't.
Segwit2x had a rushed schedule, no proper specs and targeted an impossible to meet deadline of August 1st, which is exactly the day BIP148 went into effect.
It is quite remarkable that segwit2x rushed to meet the August 1st deadline and to now suddenly see the claim that signalling segwit was some sort of deal where segwit was signalled in exchange of the promise of the segwit2x hardfork.
In reality, it looks damn much like segwit2x was hastily created by BitMain, other miners and a handful of companies within the Bitcoin economy to meet the August 1st deadline so to be able to falsely claim that it was the NYA that enabled segwit instead of BIP148.

Looks like miners a taking advantage of the low difficulty of BCH and churn out blocks at high speed. Taking away hash power from BTC slows down the BTC chain.
After BTC difficulty resets, it's difficulty will be lower then it would otherwise have been if miners kept mining BTC. So by temporarily directing their hash power to BCH they are more profitable by fast-mining BCH blocks while simultaneously driving down the difficulty of the BTC chain.
After BCH difficulty resets, miners will probably abandon it en masse and wait for its adjusted difficulty setting algorithm to kick in which slashes the difficulty if blocks come slower than a treshold.
That makes economic sense. But it ain't a pretty sight.
As for signalling: I think the 90% NYA signalling still holds because shouldn't we be looking at the signalling in BTC only?

Ok fair enough, better be safe than sorry. Still, you can also temporarily send your BTC to a breadwallet on an iPhone that is not jailbroken. Then get the BCH out of your nano by for instance importing its seed into Electrum Cash. Consider the seed now to be compromised and don't ever use it again. Then deposit the BCH from Electrum Cash directly onto an exchange that trades the BTC/BCH pair such as ViaBTC, Bittrex or HitBTC.
Then wipe your Nano, create a fresh new seed and send back the BTC from breadwallet to your freshly initialized Nano. Then destroy the breadwallet.

This is not fud, it is a real issue. Breadwallet [confirmed]( that currently, their wallet will be following the longest chain no matter whether it is the btc1-segwit2x blockchain or the Bitcoin Core blockchain. This puts the funds of users at risk.
Breadwallet so far has [not decided what the behavior of their wallet will be after segwit2x forks]( They have not spoken out against following the segwit2x blockchain like for instance [SamouraiWallet has](
I hope Breadwallet can clearly communicate to their users how they intend to handle segwit2x. So far their commucation has been confusing.
Segwit2x supporters have an incorrect definition of "Bitcoin". According to their definition, if there exists two blockchains that have the same difficulty adjustment algorithm and both use the same SHA-256 based PoW algorithm, then whichever chain has the most cumulative hash power is "Bitcoin".
This definition of "most hashpower wins" is in clear contradiction with how Bitcoin is defined in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. It would lead to bizarre wallet behavior where a wallet could just flip-flop between blockchains depending on which chain happens to have the most cumulative PoW.
I am hoping Breadwallet can clarify their position soon.

This gives the false impression that there were to legitimate sides of the debate that were more or less evenly split.
In retrospect I believe the blocksize debate has been largely manufactured by a small, privately funded group with the sole intention to disrupt Bitcoin. They tried to confuse the community and create chaos by:
* Continuously spreading misinformation on social media (Reddit, Twitter) using countless sockpuppets and shills;
* Spamming transactions to rack up fees and make it appear as if there is a problematic transaction capacity shortage;
* Manufacturing backdoor "agreements" such as the New-York Agreement (NYA) and pretending it has community-wide support;
* Spreading the misinformation that miners rule over control Bitcoin by claiming that the chain with the most hashpower is Bitcoin by definition;
* Spreading the misinformation that segwit was locked in thanks to the NYA and denying it was  because of BIP148 by shaolinfry;
* Spreading misinformation about segwit, asserting it is unsafe;
* Personally attacking Bitcoin developers such as Greg Maxwell;
* Asserting that after their hardfork in November, Bitcoin will be the altcoin, and Segwit2x will become the real Bitcoin, supplanting the current Bitcoin devs with jgarzik &amp; co.
The effect of this misinformation campaign has been that it creates the appearance that Bitcoin is split in two camps fighting each other. In reality, I strongly believe that the community is in overwhelming support of the current group of Bitcoin developers.
It is great to see that many here in r/bitcoin counter misinformation and reply with information that is factually and verifiably correct, implicitly exposing the misinformation for the lies with an agenda that they are.
I believe Bitcoin resisted the social engineering attack that it has endured for the past year. Segwit has been activated and Bitcoin has nothing to fear from hardforks having a couple mediocre devs thanks to the world class engineering of the Bitcoin developers.
Yet, we must be aware of this attack vector that aims to split the community so we can recognize it as soon as it reoccurs and counter it more quickly and with less drama as this time.

As long as I verify my payments with my own node, I don't care about anyone else's nodes. This is true for everyone who wants to accept Bitcoin payments safely. They run their own node that they downloaded from bitcoin.org and which validates the rules of Bitcoin. It really doesn't matter at all how many non-Bitcoin nodes there exist. These nodes don't even exist for as far as the Bitcoin network is concerned.
Perhaps have a look at this: [Peter Wuille on importance of full nodes](
Especially take note of this:
"if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating."
In other words - running nodes ensures that Bitcoin remains decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:36:51


It was envisioned in section 8 of the [whitepaper]( titled "Simplified Payment Verification":
"As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network."
Note how the situation in which Bitcoin has the minority of the hashpower is referred to as an *attack*.
Fortunately it is trivial for SPV wallets to discover which nodes serve the btc1-segwit2x blockchain. That is because [a big block marks the fork]( and this big block is invalid to Bitcoin nodes. This enables SPV wallets to know which nodes are on the segwit2x chain.

You're presenting two cases in which this can happen: intentionally and unintentionally. I'll address both.
**The unintentional hardfork**
If two sets of nodes unexpectedly have diverging consensus then consensus must be quickly restored by deciding which fork lives on as "Bitcoin". This is likely to be unilaterally decided by the developers since:
* No time can be lost and reaching broader consensus takes too much time;
* Consensus might be impossible to reach because no matter which chain will be chosen, there will inevitably be parties that lose out because their transactions happened on the wrong chain and thus will disagree no matter what.
The miners will be alerted to which consensus rules are valid and considered "Bitcoin" to prevent them from continuing to produce blocks that are now deemed invalid.
Ofcourse, miners are free to keep producing previously-valid blocks and any nodes that did not upgrade their software will keep accepting these blocks. However, the chain that these nodes are extending no longer is Bitcoin.
I mention this however to show you that nothing prevents miners and nodes from continuing a chain with any random consensus rules. As long as there are miners producing blocks for which there exist nodes that accept them, there will be a blockchain being extended.
However, Bitcoin nodes and the Bitcoin economy will not accept any coins from this chain because it is not Bitcoin. It is now an altcoin. It will have to get its own symbol on an exchange and its token value will be a fraction of that of Bitcoin.


**The intentional hardfork**
Anyone is free to take the Bitcoin source code, make modifications and create a node that has consensus rules that differ from the ones by the software published on bitcoin.org.
Similarly, miners have the freedom to start producing blocks that are valid according to the new consensus rules only. Such a block will extend the blockchain held by the node running the modified consensus rules. Ofcourse, unchanged nodes running bitcoin.org software will ignore these blocks.
Two blockchains now simultaneously exist. The issue of having to chose which one is the correct chain *does not exist*. Anyone can individually decide for themselves which chain it considers valid and by extension which coin it accepts! This is exactly the situation with BCH and will be the situation with segwit2x.
The only argument left is a semantic one: which chain is called "Bitcoin"? This is unambiguous: "Bitcoin" is the system as defined by Satoshi's whitepaper and has some properties that are narrowly defined.
One of these properties is that nodes extend the longest chain with *valid blocks* according to **consensus**. That means that BCH and segwit2x cannot be Bitcoin, because the change of the rules didn't have consensus. This will be apparent by the fact that no one refers to BCH or segwit2x as "Bitcoin" except for a very small group of people.

Shifting goal posts much? Over the past 20 years, banks have been messing up the funds of their depositors at a rate of 28 bank failures per year. The fact that these losses are “insured” (actually paid out of the pockets of other banks’ customers) doesn’t change that fact.
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:26:07


Whether or not this jump to 35% is variance or caused by genuine increased Segwit supporting hashpower can be expressed by a single number. This number P(variance) is the chance that the jump is caused by variance. It can be approximated based on historical data.
Without knowing P(variance) we're both just making estimates. By just looking at the graph, I notice that Segwit support has only once ever exceeded 30%. This leads me to believe that the current jump is not just variance. Or more carefully put: I believe P(variance) is pretty small.
You seem to be certain that it's variance or in other words that P(variance) = 1 or close to it. I don't understand how you reach this conclusion - the fact that a jump to 35% never happened before makes it unlikely (but not impossible) that it's just variance.
So, I don't go along with your "not relevant" conclusion - there's no basis for that at the time I made my post (and still not currently).

There inevitably will be some traces of subjectivity left when building a system based on cutting edge science.
The "points" which ultimately define Bitcoin seek to implement the properties of a good money. These properties have been established as the result of a great deal of peer-reviewed science and are chosen by Satoshi and later by consensus of the Bitcoin developers.
Rigorous science battles subjectivity, and the more we learn from Bitcoin, the more objectively good the properties of the system will become.

@_date: 2017-08-20 09:02:09


No, that is not how Bitcoin works at all.
A system in which miners have the power to set the rules is not Bitcoin. It is an altcoin where nodes lose their function, developers are string puppets of miners and the majority of the Bitcoin economy has no voice.
Bitcoin will be fixed and continue to exist even if 100% of the miners were to stop mining Bitcoin in favor of some altcoin.

**Breadwallet supports the segwit2x altcoin and regards it to be Bitcoin as soon as it receives a majority of the hashpower**

@_date: 2017-08-27 22:45:52
How do you guys plan to handle segwit2x?
Will SamouraiWallet consider segwit2x to have the longest valid chain if it receives the majority of all hash power and becomes the chain with most cumulative SHA-256 hash power?
Or does SamouraiWallet plan to stick to the Bitcoin consensus rules as enforced by nodes running the software released by the Bitcoin Core developers?

Bitcoin owners have the loudest voice. They can *and will* ruin miners by selling off their coin and cratering the price of BTC if Bitcoin changes in ways they hadn't bought in to.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:29:53


No, that is not how Bitcoin works.
Miners assemble blocks, but it is the nodes in the network that decide which blocks are valid.
Nodes will discard any invalid block. For as far as nodes are concerned, an invalid block doesn't exist, will not be extending the blockchain and any hash power used to mine it will not be recognized.
The longest chain therefore always refers to the chain of *valid* blocks. Bitcoin nodes will see segwit2x blocks as invalid and will just discard them.
Some other nodes with differing consensus rules may consider these blocks to be valid according to some alternate logic. That is fine, but that's not Bitcoin, that's an altcoin. The length of their valid chain is irrelevant. It remains an altcoin.

I am happy to rectify any scenario in my post if you can explain how they are incorrect.


Do you mean anyone that does not agree with the bizarre claim that segwit2x (that a couple devs and some company called Bloq worked on for a few months) is the real "improved" Bitcoin and that Bitcoin (that hundreds of people have been working on for the past eight years) is no longer Bitcoin?


Yes, how would you describe segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:53:17


Part of the sockpuppet orchestrated misinformation campaign is the appearance of a "voice of reason" in the discussions.
This "voice of reason" misrepresents the situation by claiming that there are two camps fighting each other and that for the good of Bitcoin there should be "a compromise".
This misrepresentation paints the Bitcoin community in a rather unfavorable light to the casual bystander as being an infighting and drifting bunch. Articles on mainstream websites have picked up on manufactured drama in the past during the blocksize debate and wrote about ["blocksize war"]( or ["schism"](
There is plenty evidence that Bitcoin is sadly still in the middle if a hostile misinformation campaign. The clearest evidence is the existence of segwit2x itself. It is a preposterous idea that the closed-door meeting incepted, one-man-show contraption "segwit2x" is going to get support beyond miners and a few companies many of which have been bought.
Which gives rise to the suspicion that segwit2x is not even about something as nefarious as forcibly taking control over the Bitcoin codebase, but about killing off Bitcoin altogether.
There is only one possible outcome in which Bitcoin and the entire concept of cryptocurrency can continue to exist. That outcome is one in which segwit2x and bcash do not divide the ecosystem and will fail.
Because just imagine what happens if hardforks live on successfully as Bitcoin. Then, the 21-million cap has effectively ceased to exist. If after two hardforks there will be three equally valueble Bitcoins being Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and segwit2x then the amount of coin has tripled and seemingly value has been created from thin air. What stops Bitcoin from cloning itself endlessly and inflating the number of "bitcoin" infinitely?
The deceptively named "Bitcoin Cash" creates confusion and gives scammers a field day. A lack of adequate replay protection in segwit2x will also be a source of confusion and chaos in which many people will be duped.
The false claim that mining power dictates Bitcoin keeps being repeated although it has been refuted tirelessly. Accounts arguing in favor of segwit2x have all the properties of bought accounts.
In reality the Bitcoin community is united in its rejection of segwit2x. The developers don't want it, most users don't want it and most companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem also don't want it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:28:17


That's absolutely false. Miners do not enforce consensus rules. Nodes do. If a miner produces a block that is not according to the consensus rules as verified by every Bitcoin node then the block cannot become part of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Just purely speculating here but perhaps Blockstream managed to convince Elon Musk / SpaceX to make these satellites capable of running a pruned node.
That would be huge!
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:20:16


Yes and given the dramatic adverse effects, the Bitcoin economy is not just going to sit idle and watch it happen. There will be a hardfork that changes the PoW algo and difficulty.


Given the option of the inability to transact for months and a hardfork, a hardfork will be regarded as the best course of action and it will have consensus amongst the Bitcoin developers and the Bitcoin economy.


False. If a PoW algo change has consensus then its blocks be regarded valid by the existing Bitcoin economy and the longest valid chain will continue to exist as "Bitcoin".
On a more meta level, these are all very predictable outcomes which makes me take a step back and realize what the Segwit2x initiative actually tries to achieve. Because the Segwit2x devs must know all of this as well.
I therefore am *convinced* that the Segwit2x initiative is nothing but an attempt to stir up confusion and controversy, to create division in the community by creating two camps and create chaos. 
In other words, Segwit2x is nothing but an attempt to attack Bitcoin by disrupting its community. The amount of lying and the misinformation campaign directed at this subreddit is supporting evidence for my believe.
I personally find it annoying but I also know that Bitcoin will stand up to it due to the brilliance of its design and the bright minds furthering it.

Negative rates aren't really going to be an option. As soon as rates become negative for consumers then it will start flowing out of the banking system and into Bitcoin, gold, stocks and cash in safes.
Since banks are highly leveraged, the outflows would force them to deleverage in an attempt to meet regulatory requirements. That means less lending which can lead to a liquidity crisis where business aren't able to invest or worse renew their credit lines.
So, no, that's not gonna happen. Inflating away debt will be the inevitable *endspiel*. Bitcoin hodlers not affected.

Even that remains to be seen. Signalling "NYA" doesn't oblige miners to anything. Only after the hardfork it will be known how much hash power withdraws from Bitcoin and choses to mine the Segwit2x altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:07:58


Which is absurd. They cannot decide for others and demand everyone to refer to their altcoin as "Bitcoin".
Bitcoin is a system of consensus. They ignored the opinions of all Bitcoin developers, ignored most users and ignored most companies in the Bitcoin space. Yet, they expect that everyone is totally fine with them declaring that their altcoin is now the real "Bitcoin", shoving aside the complete Bitcoin developers team in favor of one or two developers.
It is laughable. And since a common understanding of what is Bitcoin is quite well established and definitely not segwit2x-coin, calling their altcoin "Bitcoin" can cost real people real money. That would be plain fraud.

No, "mining nodes" (aka miners) produce blocks, but do not get to decide whether their block gets to extends the blockchain.


No, "non-mining nodes" (aka nodes) decide which blocks are allowed to extend the chain.
How can Bitcoin even work if a miner gets to decide whether their own block is ok to extend the chain? It would give miners free reign and they can put anything in a block such as a 1000 BTC gift to themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:59:10


That's true in general but I believe it isn't for Bitcoin.
If a competing altcoin is able to overtake Bitcoin, then this raises a painful issue.
Apparently a cryptocurrency can just be supplanted by a competing one, potentially rendering the coins of hodlers worthless. What does this mean for the value of any cryptocurrency if it can just become worthless in favor of the next-big-thing?
If Bitcoin is toppled then this wouldn't look good for cryptocurrency in general as it means that *any* cryptocurrency can be toppled and become worthless.

There really can't be any confusion about what is "Bitcoin". It is generally accepted that the software created by the Bitcoin developers which is currently made available from the bitcoin.org website represents "Bitcoin".
It doesn't look like that the clone made by Jeff Garzik is going to be considered "Bitcoin". None of the current Bitcoin developers regard it to be Bitcoin. It is generally seen as an altcoin.
For segwit2x to be accepted as "Bitcoin" consensus is required amongst all the participants of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the developers. All people running Bitcoin nodes would have to agree to switch to the btc1-segwit2x software.
Such consensus is simply nowhere to be found.

Any group can publish a node with differing consensus rules and is free to claim the name "Bitcoin" for it. But sadly they have no control over how other people wish to refer to their coin.
As a concrete example, Jeff Garzik can freely claim that segwit2x is "Bitcoin". Unfortunately for him, I can just as freely decide to ignore that and refer to his coin as "MinerCoin" or "JeffCoin". No one stops me. 
It depends on what people adopt. There isn't some agency where the name "Bitcoin" can be claimed.
A group claiming to be the real "Bitcoin" but without having any support from the Bitcoin developers, without support from most of the economy and with hardly any support from users will unsurprisingly fail.
Perhaps you can explain what justifies calling BCH or segwit2x "Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:32:49


Do you really believe that the Bitcoin devs are going to give up developing on the Core git and sheepishly start contributing to the hostile hardfork of Jeff Garzik &amp; co?
Do you believe that the current Bitcoin economy that uses Bitcoin Core software is just going to shrug their shoulders and say "oh yeah fine, we will now all switch and start using the software of one-man-army Jeff Garzik and we're totally cool with that"?
No, ofcourse not. Because that would mean that miners rule Bitcoin which would make it worthless.
Just imagine such a world for a second. What's the point of having nodes? Might as well do away with them if it is miners that decide what's a valid block and by extension define Bitcoin. We'd truly have MinerCoin as nodes lost the power to stop changes unilaterally decided and forced upon the Bitcoin economy by miners.


They very well understand the importance of nodes and the balance of power. Supporting MinerCoin would destroy its value because Bitcoin is no longer decentralized but ruled by the mining cartel. That is not Bitcoin. It would be the end of Bitcoin. So no, merchants will never actually support Segwit2x.


On the contrary. They know that for Bitcoin to survive they cannot let themselves and the economy be coerced by miners into making changes that they don't support.
But like I explained - I have no doubt that the above is known to the Segwit2x crowd as well because I don't believe they are dumb enough to think that Core will just politely step out of the way and be totally fine with Jeff Garzik taking over and will close the Bitcoin git and happily start contributing to MinerCoin. It is a thought that's just too preposterous for anyone to take seriously.
So Occams razor tells me that Segwit2x is solely intended to disrupt the community. It's like an expensive kind of advanced trolling - surely it is going to create some heated discussions which will make Bitcoin look divided to the casual observer whilst in reality it is not.
On the date of the hardfork nothing noteworthy will happen and Bitcoin will chug along just fine. In the mean time I hope the amount of drama that segwit2x  tries to stir up stays limited.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:01:39


Nothing special will happen. Creating blocks would be slower for a limited time period. Slow blocks occur at present already due to block time variance. Once the difficulty resets, block creation will speed up.
If the slowdown is prolongued then it is expected that there will be overwhelming support for doing a PoW algo change.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:33:37


And also 2x as much spam. It is clear now that miners have been spamming the blockchain for months to influence the blocksize debate and game fee estimating wallets. Enabling miners to generate four MB of spam every 9 minutes makes me cringe.
Freeloading companies are also happy to misappropriate the blockchain and bloat it with spam transactions. They leech by repurposing the scarce on-chain space to try out some shaky business models to the detriment of normal Bitcoin users. I say fuck off to them.
On-chain space ought to be expensive. I think segwit should introduce be the last blocksize increase ever. This will promote the use of second layer solutions that truly scale.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:26:10


The Bitcoin community is united and always has been. The false image of a divided community is completely manufactured by the Segwit2x crowd. Their troll army, misinformation and outright lies have infested this subreddit.
Their fud provokes emotional and hostile responses which might well be their actual goal. This can create a picture of a bitterly fighting and divided community which the mainstream press sadly falls for. It is an attempt to drag on the blocksize debate to November even though it had concluded in December 2015 with the publication of the scaling roadmap which had overwhelming support.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:23:42


False. There hasn't been any hardfork. We can only know how much hash power migrates to the 2x hardfork after it has actually occurred.
Even if right now 90% miners signal support for the 2x hardfork, miners are free to keep mining Bitcoin after the hardfork. In other words, the signalling does not oblige miners to anything so the significance of the 90% number is low.


False. Bitcoin is well defined by Satoshi's [whitepaper]( Miners are free to withdraw their hashpower but that will not magically alter the definition of Bitcoin.

This is completely absurd.
This means that to know what I am transacting with breadwallet, I first have to check where the majority of the hashpower happens to sit so I can know if I am transacting on the bitcoin.org-Bitcoin chain or the btc1-segwit2x chain.
Secondly, since the majority of the hash power is very likely controlled by a single individual, this person gets to define which chain is considered "Bitcoin" if we were to adopt this bizarro definition.

In case miners stall progress by refusing to support Segwit then at some point the price will start to go down, which directly hurts their profits. Reversely - if Segwit activation comes closer because miners signal their readiness then the price will go up.
If this price action would not happen then the inevitable conclusion must be that something is genuinely wrong with Segwit and the Core developers will have to go back to the drawing board.
However Segwit really is a significant improvement on many fronts so the price can be expected to move higher as more miners signal readiness.
Miners are simply not ready yet.

It is really a misconception to think that node count matters. It doesn't. What counts is what nodes people with a stake in Bitcoin run. That includes anyone who owns Bitcoin and want to transact fully trustless. They will spin up a node that runs the consensus rules that they consider to be Bitcoin. Then they can transact with anyone or any exchange that runs the same Bitcoin software. It doesn't matter that there are a gazillion nodes running something else.

Complete nonsense.
Valid bitcoin is being freshly minted into existence *only* within blocks that are part of the longest *valid* blockchain.
After a miner creates a block, it is broadcast to the network and every node that sees it immediately validates it. In case the block does not satisfy its consensus rules, the node will discard the block. It will be as if the block never existed. It is not Bitcoin and the coinbase reward is not bitcoin. It is unspendable and thus worthless.

Except that it is in case miners are allowed to dictate the protocol.
If you concede that changes cannot be prevented if 90% of the hashpower support it, then you also concede that segwit2x is an altcoin where miners are in full control.
After all, if hash power can dictate the rules then miners cannot be stopped from changing the rules of segwit2x again and again in any way that they see fit.

Unlike the BCH fork:
* There is no replay protection planned to prevent that one transaction can spend both segwit2x-coin and Bitcoin. A Bitcoin transaction can be replayed on the segwit2x chain and if you do a segwit2x transaction it can be replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain without your consent. This risks losing funds;
* Breadwallet bizarrely will consider Jeff Garziks' segwit2x altcoin to be Bitcoin if only it receives the majority if the hash rate. This means that your breadwallet changes from being a Bitcoin wallet into being a segwit2x altcoin wallet without any warning.
Yeah I am not making this up - it is bizarre - but this is exactly what will happen as soon as segwit2x obtains the majority of the hash power. And since the majority of the hash power is very likely being controlled by a single chinese miner, this miner apparently gets to decide what Bitcoin is. Absurd.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:15:27
[Breadwallet will potentially be following the segwit2x chain](
Quoting u/aaronvoisine:
**"Breadwallet follows the majority of hashing power on the original PoW algorithm, segwit2x or no, it follows the Nakamoto consensus".**
After the creation of the segwit2x altcoin in November, breadwallet will potentially be doing segwit2x transactions. In that case you *risk losing your BTC* sitting in the Bitcoin blockchain.
**Move your BTC out of breadwallet before the hardfork**.
A segwit2x transaction can be replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain which means that your BTC *move there as well*. The receiving end of your breadwallet transaction receives both the segwit2x MinerCoin as well as your BTC in case your transaction is being replayed.
Secondly, when breadwallet shows that you have received some amount, then you must be aware that **you are receiving segwit2x MinerCoins**, and not actual BTC. If you were expecting to receive Bitcoin then you are being duped.
EDIT: added "potentially" because breadwallet follows "the majority of the hashing power". This needs further clarification:
* What will bw do if segwit2x temporarily has the majority of the hashpower? After some hours, the Bitcoin blockchain might regain the majority of the hashpower. Will bw switch back to Bitcoin?
* Which chain will bw follow if the majority of hashpower switches back and forth between segwit2x and Bitcoin a couple of times?

Also, when the price passed $1000 for the first time in 2014, in the following months the price crashed all the way down to $200. It took almost two years before $1000 was reached again.
So, expecting to profit from hodling for only 1 year might be too optimistic. Hodling until at least half a year after the next halving event is likely going to be more profitable, even though it takes another 3 years. But it might well be worth the wait. Patience is key.

* 90% Or more of the hashpower will switch to segwit2x (this won't happen because it would bankrupt miners while mining a worthless coin);
* The fearmongering that Bitcoin will die if all miners switch (it won't, Bitcoin can wait out until the next difficulty adjustment and as a last resort do an emergency hardfork);
* The blockchain with the most hashpower is "Bitcoin" (it is not, that's not how it was [designed](

Sorry, but no. The nodes enforce consensus by only extending their local copy of the blockchain with blocks that are valid according to the consensus rules as programmed into the software that the node runs.
From a node point of view, hash power used to mine any block that it sees as invalid is disregarded and the block and the hashes used to find it effectively do not exist for as far as the node is concerned.
As an example: if 90% of the hashpower were to mine blocks that the Bitcoin software sees as invalid, and the remaining 10% of the hash power continues to mine blocks that the Bitcoin software sees as valid, then from every Bitcoin node point of view the hash rate has dropped to 10% and the other 90% of hash rate is considered to be nonexistent as well as any blocks it may produce.


Yep. In such a situation consensus is likely to form for a hardfork that changes the proof of work algorithm and resets the difficulty.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:54:10

@_date: 2017-08-22 18:07:00
Segwit is already a doubling in capacity. It is prudent to watch the effects of this doubling in blocksize first. It lowers fees which is good but also potentially reduces node count which is very bad for the decentralized properties of Bitcoin.
The segwit2x is an altcoin in which only a fraction of the ecosystem was being involved. A ckosed door meeting between miners and companies and the NYA that was concocted couldn't be any more opposite to the consensus seeking nature of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin developers unanimously reject the changes proposed by segwit2x and won't be adopting them. The majority of the users also rejects the changes and most companies in the ecosystem also haven't pledged support.
In the light of this opposition it is dishonest to refer to segwit2x as "Bitcoin". This can dupe unsuspecting users and amounts to fraud since segwit2x clearly is not Bitcoin.
The assertion that Bitcoin developers should give in and adopt the segwit2x changes to avoid the damage caused by segwit2x going live is pure blackmail. One way to avoid damages is to concede that segwit2x is not Bitcoin and to implement two-way replay protection.
Segwit2x has only a fraction of the number of developers of Bitcoin and an even smaller fraction of its experience. That's why the majority of the ecosystem sticks with Bitcoin and its developers and dismisses segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:40:48


The signalling is meaningless. The actual amount of hash power withdrawing from Bitcoin can only be known after the hardfork.
Ofcourse, miners are unlikely to stop mining Bitcoin after the hardfork unless they are prepared to lose big sums of money by mining an altcoin which has a tiny fraction of the value of Bitcoin.
Yet if miners would do so and all of them were to abandon Bitcoin then a PoW algo change will be required and difficulty will be reset to get Bitcoin going again. Such a hardfork would likely have consensus in order to contain damage to Bitcoin and to protect it against 51% attacks from rogue hash power.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:40:38
I maintain that the statement of Aaron Voisine implies that breadwallet can switch to the Bcash blockchain at any time it obtains the majority of the hash power.
If indeed he or someone from Breadwallet clarifies that Bcash is considered to have a different PoW algorithm compared to Bitcoin because of its modified difficulty adjustment algorithm then I will retract my post.

This discussion has been had many times now and the consensus amongst the Bitcoin developers is that the increase which segwit2x proposes is irresponsible. Someone on reddit just handwaving this away is not very credible.


BCH has an average block size way below 1 MB because no one uses it. An occasional 8 MB block would indeed not be much of an issue. A sustained load of 8 or even 4 MB blocks may reduce the node count and jeopardize the decentralized properties of Bitcoin. As soon as Bitcoin becomes too centralized it ceases to be trustless and will lose all its value.


Gregory Maxwell has made large contributions to segwit which is a blocksize doubling. Why would he have bothered if he didn't want a blocksize increase?
Miners on the other hand have stalled segwit for 10 months while simultaneously stirring up drama about full blocks. BIP148 finally forced miners to signal for segwit.


BCH has only a handful of devs and [no active development]( - in fact the project looks pretty dead.

The fact that it is viable for someone doesn't mean it isn't spam.
For instance, it is viable to store videos on the blockchain, and in fact it has been done.

That significantly decreases the usability of Bitcoin and directly hurts its value, negatively impacting anyone that owns bitcoin to the benefit of only a few or some company.

Obviously not. The consensus will be that bitcoin.org is no longer part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Bitcoin developers will publish the Bitcoin software on some other website.
That's why I wrote: "the software created by the Bitcoin developers which is **currently** made available from the bitcoin.org website". So currently, in this point in time.


Please point out where I made any appeal to authority. I did not. Whichever software is considered to be Bitcoin is not determined by any authority, but by the individual decisions of everyone who wants to transact bitcoin.


The consensus will be that bitcoin.org has software that is no longer Bitcoin and people would either not upgrade to any software published on "bitcoin".org. Everyone wanting to transact bitcoin will try to reach consensus on where to get the software from that they consider to be Bitcoin.

Granted, the Bitcoin developers are a relatively small group and only few people touch the consensus layer. However there is discussion and peer review. On top of that, anyone can propose changes through the so-called Bitcoin Improvement Process.
That said - if the Bitcoin developers were to release software that has changes that are against the will of the Bitcoin economy then these changes will be rejected. The Bitcoin economy has the discretion to reject the Bitcoin software as published by the Bitcoin developers. Simply by not upgrading their nodes with the new version, anyone in the Bitcoin economy has the power to reject the changes that the Bitcoin developers put forward.
This means that the Bitcoin devs cannot create a version of the Bitcoin software that rewards themselves free bitcoin for instance. The nodes that validate the blocks again have the final say.


That is not really a problem. The economy must decide which software version they prefer. In case the economy is also equally divided then there will likely be a compromise as a hardfork under such circumstances would be an existential threat to Bitcoin.

No he was not. This is absolutely false. Citation needed.


But that won't happen. After the hardfork and after the first s2x block is mined that is not a Bitcoin block there will two types of nodes:
* S2x nodes accepting s2x blocks and rejecting all Bitcoin blocks;
* Bitcoin nodes accepting Bitcoin blocks as normal and rejecting all s2x blocks.
Both types of nodes have their own set of consensus rules and extend their own chain. It is up to the miners which kind of blocks they wish to produce - Bitcoin blocks or s2x blocks.


Merchants could have start accepting Litecoin which has 4 times the capacity of Bitcoin, but this never happened.


No it would not. It is equally easy for a miner to stuff a block with 1 MB as it is to stuff it with 2 MB of fake transactions.


I think I am repeating myself when I say that ofcourse the Bitcoin devs are not just going to sit back with their arms crossed and watch Bitcoin die. No, they will do a hardfork. Given the choice between Bitcoin dead and a hardfork, a hardfork is the best course of action and can be expected to have consensus.


Thanks for confirming the actual agenda of Segwit2x.


You must be out of your mind. Miners have been stalling segwit for 10 months by refusing to signal for it. If a capacity increase were so urgent, then why didn't miners decide to signal for it as soon as they possibly could? They would have had more capacity sooner and *still* would have the option to do a hardfork. Clearly, this is not about blocksize or transaction capacity but about who controls the codebase as you yourself now admit.
At the end of the day it comes down to credibility of the crypto-economies in its developers. This is what drives the value of a currency. Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency having the most value by far which reflects the robustness of the ecosystem including the developers.
Would it be one-man-army Jeff Garzik be able to threaten Bitcoin? My prediction is that no, he can not and Segwit2x will fail miserably. The current Bitcoin developers have by far the most credibility given that they were on the scene right after Satoshi appeared, have the most experience, are the largest in numbers and amongst which are some PhDs which are on the forefront of cryptocurrency, to name a few reasons.
As I said it inconceivable that Jeff Garzik is so naive to believe segwit2x has any future. The same Jeff Garzik that made [these insightful remarks]( The same can be said for BitPay - what are they smoking? It's as if they have completely lost their minds. And that is evidence to the theory that they have been bought by miners, BitMain in particular.

Yes, I love breadwallet, nice to see that you're aware, but then why did you need to offend me by asking me to ["call the Bitcoin Therapy Hotline"](


Thanks, although some of this is so bloody obvious that I have a hard time believing I am telling you anything new, especially since just now I saw that the *exact same issue* had come up before:
[PSA: Breadwallet will blindly follow the chain Bitmain chooses, expects Core to be "abandoned". Move your coins elsewhere!](
But I don't want to jump to any nefarious conclusions and still believe you're interested. I also had a [similar discussion]( with from Jaxx and he also proofed to be quite stubborn to understand the actual issue. Explaining about the legal hot waters of using "BTC" or "Bitcoin" to refer to segwit2x-coin seemed to help, so allow me to just drop that here:
Showing Breadwallet users a BTC balance that is actually a balance of segwit2x altcoin can be considered fraudulent and is likely to lead to loss of funds for which Breadwallet can be held liable.
BTC is the ticker for Bitcoin. There is absolutely no ambiguity about what is meant by "Bitcoin". Bitcoin is implemented by the software that is published by the group of Bitcoin developers commonly referred to as "Bitcoin Core" on the bitcoin.org website. This is what the overwhelming majority of the cryptocurrency community considers to be "Bitcoin".
The NYA represents only a small fraction of the Bitcoin economy. They have failed to convince the cryptocurrency community at large that "BTC" and "Bitcoin" are to be understood as to be referring to the cryptocurrency as implemented by btc1-segwit2x software after activation of segwit2x. It is already clear now that there is hardly any support for that change in definition of "BTC" and "Bitcoin" except for amongst the signatories of the NYA.
Breadwallet therefore cannot claim not to be aware that "BTC" and "Bitcoin" have never changed their meaning amongst the overwhelming majority of the cryptocurrency community. Therefore, showing a segwit2x balance as a BTC or Bitcoin balance can be considered neglect and Breadwallet can likely be held liable for any damages caused by it.

Actually it is not so straightforward. I experienced this when I wanted to access my BCH from an Electron Cash wallet by importing my breadwallet seed.
I ended up having to extract the private keys from my breadwallet seed and import each one into Electron Cash. I *still* didn't see all my funds until I realized that hadn't exported the private keys of my change addresses. Definitely not newbie stuff.

Breadwallet will present a segwit2x altcoin balance as a BTC balance to unsuspecting users, because it incorrectly regards the segwit2x altcoin to be BTC.
This risks duping a user receiving a payment and thinking it is BTC while it actually is segwit2x-coin.
When sending funds, a user will be sending segwit2x-coin while breadwallet pretends it is sending BTC. If the user intended to pay someone expecting actual BTC then the payment will fail and the user loses his segwit2x-coin.
Is this so hard to understand?

It is plain fraud. Anyone being told they are buying Bitcoin while actually receiving MinerCoin has been defrauded.
Bitcoin is well understood to have verifiable properties which creates a common understanding of what Bitcoin is. A fork that does not have consensus will not be known as Bitcoin. Therefore, trying to sell it as Bitcoin is fraud.

This is simply not true. During its beginnings, no one was willing to pay a single dollar for no matter how much coin. There are accounts of people trying to sell large amounts of coin for a couple bucks and getting no bids. That’s not so strange for a new technology dropped by some unknown, anonymous author that claims to have worked around a fundamental mathematical problem and secondly that wants to be a money. Who in the world would buy into that?

Examples? I am not aware of any developers of significance that left the project due to hostility. There have been a few highly visible people in the Bitcoin space that turned their back to Bitcoin such as Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik but none of them made any significant contribution to Bitcoin.


Yes, which means that anyone interested in developing for a specific cryptocurrency can do so by simply contributing to the Bitcoin git which is the most active and where healthy peer-review takes place by the worlds' top cryptocurrency developers. Improvements to Bitcoin are of such high quality that indeed they often end up being copied 1-on-1 into other cryptocurrencies with the result that these other cryptocurrencies remain mere clones of Bitcoin without any fundamental differentiating features.
Litecoin is a good example of this. It's an exact copy of Bitcoin with the exception that it has 4 times as much transaction capacity as Bitcoin. (Which, as an aside, ought to make you wonder that if transaction capacity is such an issue, then why Litecoin [has never taken off](
This already is a strong hint that segwit2x is cannot possibly be about blocksize or transaction capacity, but that these issues are used as a ruse to achieve some different goal.


I suspect that you misunderstand the function of a node. It is not to just distribute blocks across the Bitcoin network. A node has the critical function of *validating blocks* that miners produce. In fact, it is the nodes that define what is Bitcoin. For instance, if a miner create a block that creates 100 BTC out of thin air and sends it to itself, then the nodes in the network will disregard this block as "not Bitcoin" and as far as nodes are concerned, the block never existed.
Now, if miners were to collude and 90% of the hash power start producing segwit2x blocks that are not valid according to Bitcoin nodes then these blocks will all be disregarded. Miners might be of the opinion that their blocks *are* valid and happily continue mining them. But that's no longer Bitcoin. It is an altcoin that has been created in a closed door meeting by a couple of companies and miners.


BitPay support must be swamped right now by calls and e-mails from confused and worried-to-death merchants. Merchants are being asked to install software which no longer processes BTC payments and switches to accepting Segwit2x coins instead. BitPay declares Bitcoin near-dead: "If you are not running Segwit2x, your node will be on a dysfunctional minority chain when the base block size increases to 2MB." (see the addendum at the bottom of their latest [blog post](


There is strong evidence that full blocks were caused by long-running spam attacks by miners. Note that a miner can stuff anything into a block and fill it up with fluff at only the cost of forfeiting transaction fees. Worse even - the additional artificial scarcity that this stuffing created is likely to have gamed fee-estimating algorithms in wallets and tricked them into setting high fees. Stuffing blocks might therefore even have a net profitable effect for miners.
On the other hand, if we assume that no stuffing was going on and full blocks are solely because of by legitimate Bitcoin transaction then this is a shining testament to the success of Bitcoin. It is a sign of health and strength if doing an on-chain Bitcoin transaction has real actual dollar value.


That's a false dichotomy. The other option is for sellers of low-cost products to have patience and wait until LN makes payments cheap enough to sell the proverbial coffee for Bitcoin. A much more serious issue that impedes the adoption of bitcoin for making everyday payments is its massive volatility and its tendency to dramatically rise in value over time. People are reluctant to spend and generally hodl on to their coin. An additional impediment are the existing payment options which are free of charge for the consumer and very efficient. In many countries you can now pay without even taking your debit card out of your wallet. Just hold your wallet next to a scanner and --beep-- you just paid in a predictable fiat amount. That's going to be pretty hard to beat.


That remains to be seen. The signalling of "NYA" does not oblige miners to anything. Only after the hardfork we will really know how much hash power stops mining Bitcoin.
You have to realize though that mining is not some sort of courtesy. Miners are incentivized by money and the mining industry is big business. If a miner stops mining Bitcoin then it is leaving money on the table.


The Bitcoin developers do not have to do anything. They will just continue to develop Bitcoin and if miners behave erratically from the Bitcoin point of view then they will try to find consensus for corrective action. This might be a PoW algo change and a difficulty adjustment, or other measures that regains the health of Bitcoin.

The goal of segwit2x is only to drag on the blocksize debate and create the appearance of a divided community to the naive bystander.
There is plenty of evidence for this.
First, outright misinformation is spread such as the ridiculous claim that the longest claim is Bitcoin. No, the longest *valid* chain is Bitcoin. They claim that miners decide how a valid block looks like. No, *nodes* do that. It is all in the 2009 whitepaper and it is fundamental to how Bitcoin works.
Second the tone of the debate is often non-technical and trollish. For instance, acting confused when talking about Bitcoin and pretending to understand the writer is referring to segwit2x. Or by stating for a fact that Segwit2x has wide support.
The Segwit2x hardfork doesn't have a chance in hell of succeeding. Therefore it likely only exists as an attempt to divide the Bitcoin community and make it seem as if chaos reigns. In reality, the blocksize debate was already over in december 2015 when the groundwork for a doubling in transaction capacity was laid.
When segwit kicks in a week from now, Bitcoin will almost double its capacity and improvements like signature aggregation will increase capacity even further. Let's evaluate these significant capacity increases first before we double with a rushed hardfork by a team that tries to coerce the current Bitcoin developers into making changes that they do not want and the Bitcoin economy also doesn't want.

I think it's more that for many bitcoiners it is clear that most altcoins are copycats that have nothing to offer or are even complete scams.
I believe it is more altcoiners hating on Bitcoin. There's hardly any polite discussion on technical merit where altcoiners show what makes their coin so special.
Instead altcoiners often resort to outright lies and personal attacks. And that's mostly because they can't manage convince anyone that their coin is somehow superior.

... then the security will not be any worse. This is because the cost of all hashpower applied is proportional to the price per BTC.
An attacker would have to spend more money on hashpower than he can earn from the block reward.

I read back your comments and you mentioned this before as well. Somehow I missed this and interpreted your comments to be about the _planned_ behavior when a split occurs. Your comments make much more sense now.
Having said that, it still stands as a disturbing issue that breadwallet users using the current version apparently are going to be on the segwit2x chain without being made aware (if miners give segwit2x their hash power).
As Greg also points out - SPV wallets depend on hash power to be honest. Section 8 paragraph 2:
"As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network"
Honest nodes being nodes that accept blocks according to the consensus rules that the SPV wallet considers "Bitcoin".
"but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker."
"Overpowered by an attacker" refers to the majority of the hashpower ("overpowered") that creates invalid blocks that dishonest nodes then pretend to be valid and which fool the SPV wallet into following an alternate blockchain.
Note that depending on what breadwallet considers to be Bitcoin, this can be read either way. In case breadwallet sees segwit2x as the valid chain, and is connected to both segwit2x and non-segwit2x nodes, then the non-segwit2x nodes will be seen as dishonest. If cumulative hash power on the non-segwit2x chain overtakes segwit2x, then for as far as breadwallet is concerned, it is being "overpowered by an attacker". 
"While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network."
So the SPV wallet potentially cannot see that it is connected to a dishonest node, and can be tricked into accepting transactions that did not happen.
"One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes"
Where "network nodes" are fully validating nodes that verify according to the consensus rules that breadwallet intends to follow. In this example that would be a segwit2x node.
Ofcourse what I and any user of a breadwallet wants to know is how it will be updated to handle segwit2x.
You haven't addressed that your definition of what is "Bitcoin" contradicts the whitepaper. Your claim that it is about most cumulative hashpower is clearly false, as only hashpower creating _valid_ blocks is considered to exist. Invalid blocks are discarded, didn't happen, and do not add anything to the amount of cumulative hashpower.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:36:47


They have no control over how miners assemble their blocks. Miners are free to put anything in their block. However if the block doesn't pass the nodes' validation then the node will just discard the block. It is as if the block never existed. The resources the miner spent were all for naught because they will not receive any block reward.


"Consensus between miners" is not general consensus. I am sure that miners can get consensus around a lot of things that the larger Bitcoin economy doesn't want. The interests of miners and the Bitcoin economy at large aren't fully aligned.


Bitcoin is not broken if miners decide start to produce invalid blocks. Nodes will just ignore those blocks and miners will soon be bankrupt.
 &gt;2) Upgrade
No, nodes will not "upgrade" to accept rules dictated by miners, because the people running the nodes understand that if miners can call the shots, then Bitcoin is dead. So anyone running a node and having a stake in Bitcoin is never ever going to "upgrade". And there's absolutely nothing miners can do about it.

I wouldn't mind if segwit were the final blocksize increase ever. On-chain space ought to be expensive because it has real, actual cost. Aggregated signatures can squeeze in another 30% capacity increase without changing the block size. Then, perhaps that's just going to have to be enough for long, long time.
* Blocksize increase require a hardfork which is going to create two chains. This creates an attack vector to divide the community.
* On-chain capacity will be never enough. If it is too cheap, it will be used for data transfer aka spam. Centralized mining likely makes stuffing blocks profitable, so no matter how big blocks will be, miners will spam them full to game fee estimating algorithms.
* Scarce on-chain capacity is an incentive to develop and switch to Lightning Network or other systems that enable second-layer, off-chain transactions. The more quickly this is adopted, the better. It also discourages miners to stuff blocks as they will see transactions migrating from on-chain to off-chain if they drive up the on-chain fees.

Expended hashpower is only considered if it has been used to produce a block that becomes part of the blockchain. One of the requirements is that the nodes in the network consider the block valid. Any hashpower used to mine an invalid block is not recognized by Bitcoin.
**Nodes decide which blocks are valid and are allowed to extend the blockchain.**
Perhaps you ought to have a look at [the whitepaper]( yourself:
"5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash."

The big significance of Bitcoin is being *peer-to-peer*. This is often conveniently overlooked or ignored by proponents of on-chain scaling.
Being peer-to-peer means the transfer of Bitcoin does not depend on any third party. It is the electronic equivalent of handing someone cash. This feat demands a trustless system, which in turn requires a decentralized setup.
On-chain scaling decreases the level of decentralization of Bitcoin because it will cause the number of nodes to drop. Without being decentralized, Bitcoin loses the one property that lends it all its value and will become literally worthless.

Thank you for answering.


Just to clarify: do you mean cumulatively, by summing the difficulties up until and including the tip and picking the chain with the highest sum? Or do you mean that the app follows the chain whichever has the highest difficulty at the tip?


Clear. Going forward I will work with the assumption that you will *not* be using the btc1 DNS seeds.
First off, note that [0.15 will be disconnecting from segwit2x nodes]( According to Mike Belshe of BitGo this does not have to be an issue:
"2. NODE_SegWit2x peering
Version 0.15 of Bitcoin Core, schedule to be released sometime in Septemberor early October 2017, includes a change &lt; that will disconnect all SegWit2x nodes. This is not anticipated to have much impact on SegWit2x, given that 0.14.x nodes and other nodes (btcd/bcoin/BU/BC) remain compatible and act as bridges." ([source: bitcoin-segwit2x mailing list](
Let's go along with this assumption. 


Ok. Going forward, I will work with the favorable assumption that breadwallet will succeed in finding segwit2x nodes even when not using the btc1 DNS seeds.
When breadwallet first starts up and still has to learn about any nodes, am I correct to assume that it then depends on the answers from DNS seeds to find any nodes? I will assume this to be true going forward as well.
Given my assumptions, breadwallet will be connected to a mix of btc1-segwit2x and bitcoin.org-Bitcoin nodes.
There are now two situations to consider: pre-split and post-split.
1. Pre-split (the chains of segwit2x and Bitcoin are still exactly identical).
Then, it doesn't matter to what node breadwallet is connected to - its behavior will be consistent.
2. Post-split (the chains of segwit2x and Bitcoin start to diverge because a block has been created that one chain accepts as valid and the other chain rejects as invalid.)
In this situation, there are effectively two distinct cryptocurrencies. To behave consistently, breadwallet must decide what to use: exclusively btc1-segwit2x nodes or exclusively bitcoin.org-Bitcoin nodes.


What do you mean by "PoW values"? Going forward I will assume you mean the difficulty of the chains at the tip.
The behavior of breadwallet is then that it can switch from one cryptocurrency to the other without warning, depending on which one happens to have the highest difficulty at the tip of the chain.
At the start, the difficulty will be the same for both. From previous comments I assume that breadwallet automatically picks the chain which has the majority of SHA256^2 hashpower pointed at it.
If the majority of the hash power switches to segwit2x, then am I correct to assume that breadwallet will effectively be a segwit2x wallet? If miners alternate between mining btc1-segwit2x and bitcoin.org-Bitcoin, will breadwallet in lockstep alternate between being a btc1-segwit2x wallet and a bitcoin.org-Bitcoin wallet?
More crucially, how does breadwallet intend to *automatically* establish where the hashrate sits? What algorithm is going to be used?
I suspect that breadwallet does not intend to implement such voodoo. Breadwallet will have to make an upfront decision whether it follows the segwit2x chain or the Bitcoin chain. How will breadwallet decide? Seeing that 90%+ of all hash power expresses support for segwit2x, can I assume that breadwallet will be following the segwit2x chain by default if this does not changes? Then, shouldn't breadwallet be switching to the btc1 DNS seeds?


This is not entirely hypothetical. There might be mass-migration to 0.15 close to segwit2x activation, effectively creating two separate networks of nodes that cannot easily see each other. 
If this were to happen, then breadwallet will in most instances be connected to Bitcoin Core nodes only, unless it implements logic to actively filter for btc1 nodes and hoping to find any. Breadwallet might then just as well use the btc1 DNS seeds which is a more straightforward way to find btc1 nodes.


Breadwallet must recognize that post-split, there are to distinct cryptocurrencies.
Let me know if I misunderstood anything.

Miners can still use covert asicboost by not inserting any segwit transactions in a block.
However if there's going to be a steady amount of segwit transactions being mined by non-asicboost miners then the use of asicboost starts to become more obvious: it is likely used by miners that often produce blocks without any segwit transactions in it.
Once ignoring segwit transactions means forfeiting a significant amount of fees, covert asicboost might start to be used less.

You can keep repeating the same thing but that doesn't make it become true.
Nodes *define* the blockchain. Miners cannot be trusted to mine valid nodes.
This is how soft and hardforks work. Nodes upgrade, set a date when the new rules come into effect, and miners have no choice but to upgrade their software so they produce blocks that comply.
It is not the other way around. Miners have no say in how a block looks like. Nodes decide this. Or else why have nodes?
So in your example, yes, if I change my node, and everyone else does so too, then miners have no other option than to start making sure they create blocks that nodes accept.

It is likely soon to be under scrutiny of the SEC because of the ICOs and suffers from centralized development (Vitalik Buterin) as well as unsound governance by doing a hardfork to recover from a bug in a contract, breaking the selling point that "code is law". Also, it doesn't scale. Bitcoin will be able to do all that Ethereum can do, just more efficiently and clean.
Just be careful and mindful that fortunes can be made with starting an altcoin, which attracts scammers that know very well how to market their coin but hold no technical merit.

"We will not consider segwit2x support in any way shape or form. We would consider the chain as you describe it as invalid and would continue to run Bitcoin Core backing nodes.
We see segwit2x as a firm attack on the bitcoin network and do not condone backroom deals as a way to push forward development of the bitcoin protocol.
We are very happy with the quality of code and the responsible conservative releases made by the Bitcoin Core team, and cannot see any reason why we would pull our support from them."

Theoretically yes. But I advise against risking your money by using a feature that is not widely used and which behavior is not fully known.
For instance what happens in potentially poorly tested edge cases such as when breadwallet cannot reach your segwit node? Will it incorrectly fall back to using segwit2x nodes? Then you risk losing your BTC just the same.

Miners create blocks in return for bitcoin. In each block there is a special reward especially for miners. This reward is called the coinbase reward and is currently 12.5 BTC. That's about US$ 55k at current prices of about $4,400 / BTC. In addition, a miner gets to keep transaction fees in a block, again thousands of $ worth.
This reward is handed out every 10 minutes on average. It's like a lottery every 10 minutes where miners compete to solve a block and get a  $60k reward. That amounts to $10 mio per day and $3.5 *billion* per year. It's big business.
Note the balance of power in Bitcoin between miners and nodes. A miner carefully assembles a block by putting pending transactions in it, plus the so-called coinbase transaction of 12.5 BTC which a miner is allowed to keep for themselves.
Once assembled, a miner tries to "solve" the block. This is a lottery where a miner basically has to guess a number. The more guesses per second a miner can do, the more chance it has to guess the number before anyone other miner guesses it.
Once it guesses the number, it adds it the block and proudly broadcasts the block out into the world. This is where nodes start to do their job. All Bitcoin nodes will carefully examine the block and double check if it has the correct solution and verify whether the block strictly adheres to the rules of Bitcoin. 
If the nodes in the network agree that the block is indeed valid, then it will be added to the blockchain and officially starts to exist. However if the miner made a mistake or tried anything funny, the block will be rejected by all nodes and the miner will not receive any reward.
So as you see, it is the miners that create blocks because they stand to earn money, but it is nodes that validate each and every block and ultimately decide what a Bitcoin is.

*Nodes* decide if a block can extend the chain. For a block to be eligible to extend the chain it has to pass all checks performed by a node. A node only extends its private copy of the blockchain with blocks that it deems valid according to its consensus rules. In other words: only a block that is valid from the perspective of a node extends the blockchain of that node.
If a block does not pass the validation, then the block is discarded and the hashpower expended is not part of the longest chain for as far as that node is concerned.


Yes, the proof of work expended to create the chain of *valid blocks* as decided by each node individually.
The set of nodes that enforce the consensus rules as defined by the Bitcoin software published on bitcoin.org is what we call Bitcoin. This set of rules has the most value and it are these nodes that define the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:30:10


It's the opposite.
My own node decides what is valid. If I run a fully validating node, then I don't need information from anywhere else to verify the state of the Bitcoin ledger and to check whether any payments I receive are valid. My node is all I need. It has downloaded *all blocks* since the first from other nodes and verified each block one by one. After that, my node can autonomously accept and reject payments for me. That's how Bitcoin is trustless. I don't depend on anyone else to tell me whether a payment is valid. I can check this all by myself, all I need is my fully validating node.
If I make a Bitcoin payment, then the receiver will likely verify my payment using *their own* fully validating node running the *same* Bitcoin software. This enables me to make a payment to anyone wanting to accept Bitcoin. All that the receiver needs to do is run a fully validating Bitcoin node just the way I do.
Anyone is free to spin up a gazillion nodes that run an alternate set of rules such as segwit2x or bcash. At some point, their nodes and Bitcoin nodes start to diverge and there will be differing blockchains. After that, I can no longer receive bcash or segwit2x-coin and I can no longer pay anyone running a bcash or segwit2x node. Our nodes reject each others payments. My node still accepts Bitcoin payments because I myself am still running the Bitcoin software and extend my chain with any Bitcoin blocks that miners produce. I don't care how many segwit2x or bcash nodes there exist. Just like I don't care how many Litecoin, Vertcoin or Dogecoin nodes there are. They are not relevant to me. I run Bitcoin.
Perhaps to make this all even more clear, consider this example.
I can create my own coin: TrillionCoin. I make only one single change to the Bitcoin software: starting from block 500,000 the difficulty resets to 1.
Cool, now anyone can start mining this coin, it's easy with difficulty being 1 for at least 2040 blocks. I can run a fully validating TrillionNode that only accept TrillionCoin. I can hope to get my own listing on exchanges. I can mine lots of blocks for myself with this low difficulty. Anyone wishing to accept TrillionCoin can just download the modified node software. If enough people do so, we might even have a viable economy. Nothing stops me or anyone from accepting or paying TrillionCoin - there are TrillionCoin miners and there are TrillionCoin nodes. The coin will be alive!

The majority of all hash power is controlled by a single guy in China. If Bitcoin is whatever miners can decided by "consensus" then one guy now controls Bitcoin. Once a miner has &gt;50% of the hashpower, they have *full control* because they can outmine any miner that doesn't fall in line with whatever rules they decide to impose on Bitcoin. If miner consensus rules Bitcoin, then it is fully centralized. I am not trying to troll - it is crucial to recognize this. I hope you're willing to give it some consideration.

This shows that Bitcoin is not about the number of transactions per second. Bitcoin cannot currently compete with VISA, debit cards, ApplePay, GooglePay, SamsungPay, Venmo, Paypal, Skrill, etc etc for paying your coffee. Its ever growing popularity proofs that Bitcoin has a different kind of appeal.
The ambitions of Bitcoin are on a completely different level. Bitcoin is increasingly regarded as a safe haven asset such as gold. Some fund managers start to add a small percentage of Bitcoin to their portfolios, which shows how Bitcoin slowly enters finance. All funds under management represent a value of USD 35 trillion. Even if a tiny 0.1% of that finds its way into Bitcoin that would mean 35 billion looks to buy Bitcoin.
The promise of Bitcoin is to keep its value. That is why it becomes an attractive investment such as gold. But this promise can only be kept if Bitcoin remains decentralized. As soon as the survival of Bitcoin hinges on the actions of too few, investors will no longer regard it safe and sell their holdings.
Therefore it is much more important for Bitcoin to remain sound and decentralized than to go from 7 to 15 transactions per second.
However with second layer solutions such as Lighting Network, paying for your every coffee with Bitcoin might be possible sooner that you think.

Mr. Allaire said he has "been deeply frustrated" with the "lack of progress" which he attributes to "gridlock amongst core developers".
Lack of progress? Achievements in 2016:
libsecp256k1 giving 5 times faster signature verification;
Use Tor when available;
Dynamic transaction fees in wallet;
BIP9 version bits allowing more efficient softforks;
Relative locktime;
BIP152 compact block support;
HD wallets;
Segregated witness which doubles transaction capacity and solves malleability, enabling efficient second layer solutions such as Lightning Network as well as simplifies wallet implementation;
Child pays for parent.
Also, there is no "gridlock amongst developers" - as far as I and anyone can see, a vocal minority does not agree with the way Bitcoin progresses. However, they have failed to come up with any widely supported alternative.

The obvious problem with this that users of breadwallet have to *trust* a wallet developer is not going to steal their bitcoin in a next update.
Bitcoin is trustless, and wallets should be as well. What I would like to see is that signing a transaction requires authorization by two independently developed pieces of software. For instance, as a user I want the option to have a second program co-sign every transaction I do with breadwallet.
Or, even better, I want to enforce co-signing after some timeboxed spending limit is exceeded (such as USD 100 in a week). That way, a small transaction only requires interaction with a single wallet.
The latter requires protocol changes, I believe. I am hoping that after capacity increases and privacy / fungibility improvements, protocol changes allowing to better protect ones' bitcoin will receive some attention by the Core devs.

*Currently* Bitcoin is defined by the set of consensus rules as implemented by the Bitcoin software as published on bitcoin.org by the Bitcoin developers.
Obviously, if bitcoin.org were seized by some government then this stops being the case. The Bitcoin software will be published somewhere else.
The whitepaper defines "Bitcoin" amongst others as a set of consensus rules enforced by nodes. It is true that anyone can make a copy of the software, invent new consensus rules and try to call it "Bitcoin".
Hardly anyone will go along with that however. The majority of the ecosystem will regard the software as released by the current set of developers to be "Bitcoin".

In these quotes, the "chain" refers to a chain of *valid* blocks. This is obvious if you realize that invalid blocks are dropped by nodes and do not become part of the chain. 
Now if there are nodes having differing consensus rules then after diverging there are effectively *two* distinct cryptocurrencies (say BTC and S2X). Any block that is valid to cryptocurrency BTC will be invalid for cryptocurrency S2X, and vice verse.
From what I understand, breadwallet intends to treat both chains as being a single cryptocurrency and switches over from one to the other depending on which one has most cumulative PoW. This is bizarre and is definitely going to lead to loss of funds.
For breadwallet to be a functional wallet, it cannot escape to make an explicit decision of how it wishes to present each chain and stick with it. You guys have to decide beforehand whether btc1 nodes are "BTC" or whether the current nodes represent "BTC". It can't let breadwallet decide this "automatically" i.e., on the fly based on the criteria of longest cumulative PoW.

Except that there is no encrypted information stored in the blockchain. The blockchain just contains hashes that are produced by cryptographic techniques.
Worst case a quantum computer can somehow discover private keys from information in the blockchain. But by that time, there will be bigger problems to solve as any encryption scheme relying on widely used elliptic curve crypto will be broken.
Long before that, Bitcoin can switch to a quantum hard encryption scheme. Once coin are moved to a new address that uses a quantum hard scheme, the coin will be safe.
Interesting though is to see what would happen with abandoned coin, i.e., any coin owned by Satoshi (_not_ 1 million as widely claimed but still a substantial number surely) and lost coin. Once powerful enough quantum computers start to proliferate, these coin might be targeted. I don’t think there will be any way to protect these coin.

There is not a single use case for a Blockchain that is not adequately protected by proof of work.

You are likely to lose all your money at an exchange in an instance. Most exchanges will claim to have been hacked sooner or later, meaning your BTC will be gone.
For instance, a couple months back at Bitfinex 120,000 BTC was stolen within the timespan of a few hours. Traders have no means to know whether an exchange is properly secured.
Note that it makes little sense to move 120,000 BTC in hours for any exchange, so a way to transparently secure against theft is to restrict movements of large amounts of BTC and make that verifiable on the blockchain.
Currently however traders have to rely on whatever exchanges tell them about their security, which has proven to be not worth much if anything.

Speculating is the opposite of hedging. In fact every risk increasing speculative trade is a risk reducing hedge trade for the party at the other end of the trade.
I agree that most people are speculating on BTC increasing in fiat terms. Increasingly BTC will however be more of a hedge against the risk of fiat losing its value.
In many countries, fiat has lost most or even all of its value, for example in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Ukraine and to a lesser extend Turkey, Brazil, Russia and I am sure there are more countries.
So buying BTC with fiat can already be regarded as a *hedge* in many countries, as opposed to a speculative bet. If inflation starts to rise for the major currencies then BTC will be massively used as a hedge against fiat value going up in smoke.

There is one crucial difference between gold and Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rises exponentially and has repeatedly gone up by a factor 10 over the course of one or two months.
If an ETF does not own all Bitcoin redeemable by its investors then it will become insolvent at the first 10 times increase it experiences.
I am guessing the SEC knows this too and will force an ETF to be covered 100%.

If your observation is correct then it seems likely that the spam originates from whoever control Antpool.

Unlike any other cryptocurrency, a Bitcoin node would become reachable from any place on earth meaning Bitcoin payments can be sent and verified everywhere a connection with the satellite can be established.

Doesn’t making Bitcoin quantum computing resistant involve making all vulnerable addresses unspendable for else these addresses remain vulnerable?
I’d agree that qc is nowhere near being a threat but a lot can happen in 10-20 years. Even breaking a 16-bit crypto by a qc as a PoC would already be damaging to the trust in Bitcoin. Given the long lead time for even small changes in the consensus rules, plus the fast increase of qc capabilities, plus the sensitivity of qc to Bitcoin, planning for quantum resistance may be required sooner than some might think. Just dismissing it as a far-away threat that can be dealt with in due time seems a bit reckless. Just look the drop to low-7thousands after the Google qc announcement.

If some miners unilaterally try to stop segwit against the will of the Bitcoin community, then the Bitcoin community can choose to replace the SHA2 PoW hashing algorithm. That would render all current hashing hardware almost worthless.
This is extreme, but so is blocking segwit.

At its next reset, BCH difficulty will shoot up such that it will be unprofitable to mine. Miners will switch back to BTC. Since miners have been mining BCH, the difficulty reset of BTC will be less than it would have been if miners hadn't switched to BCH, making BTC more profitable to mine. So temporarily switching to BCH cuts both ways and makes full economic sense.
However BCH adjusts difficulty down if blocks are too slow (iirc by reducing it 6 times by 20% as a one-off if less than 6 blocks are found in a 12 hour period). So, miners will wait until BCH resets its difficulty down and will start fast-mining BCH blocks again, at the same time slowing down the BTC chain which in turns has downward pressure on its difficulty.

.. is not automatically Bitcoin. The chain with the longest chain of *valid blocks* is Bitcoin.
Think for a moment about the properties of the system that you are advocating.
The proposed system, let's call it "MinerCoin" is a system in which hashpower is used to set the consensus rules.
* Developers have no voice because they have become string puppets of the miners. Miners can hire a new developer at any time and simply point all their hashpower to the implementation created by their developers.
* Nodes have lost their function because consensus rules can change without their consent.
* The economy (if there would be any) has no say at all - just as any users.
The entire ecosystem is submitted to the power of miners that have full control. Miners have the power to push through any change and the ecosystem exists by their mercy.
Clearly, such a system is unsustainable.

Inspiring as always! Especially cool is the parallel he draws between streaming information (music, movies) as enabled by the internet and streaming money which will become possible with the Lightning Network.
Instead of payments in monthly, weekly or daily chunks, LN enables payments every *second* or even fractions of that. It makes cash truly flow.
One immediate use case I see is for immediate settlement of payments between companies (or states) for anything that flows.
Imagine: a pipeline fitted with flowmeters to measure the amount delivered and received, to be connected to the LN to immediately settle the payment every second.
No more counterparty risk. Can be done between states for oil delivery or a brewery and a bar for beer.
The absence of counterparty risk is a significant saving. Contracts can become a lot simpler. No more checking needed whether the buyer will be able to pay the bill. Or reversely: no upfront payment needed for the buyer. No room for paying but not receiving anything, or delivering without getting paid.
That saves a lot of legal costs, too.

Segwit is a true scaling solution. Allowing arbitrary large blocks is not. The number of nodes in the network has been decreasing despite increased adoption. It's the nodes that preserve the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Increasing the block size has the real risk of nodes dropping out and making Bitcoin more centralized.
A centralized system has zero added value - there are already plenty. Just use Venmo, Skrill, Google Pay, Apple Pay, your debit card, VISA, Paypal.

Any lost coins (private key lost / owner incapacitated / burnt coins / Satoshi’s coins) may become accessible again. The longer it takes to migrate to qc safe algorithms, the larger this class of coins becomes. It is desirable to switch sooner to keep this class of coins as small as possible.


Which illustrates the point that I am trying to make: even small and inconsequential advancements are already perceived as threats to the security of Bitcoin. It is a matter of time before a first cryptographic operation will be performed. No matter how trivial, this would damage the trust in the security of Bitcoin.

4. Human factor. Bitcoin is defined in lines of code that are subject to change. The properties of Bitcoin undergo changes that are decided over and implemented by people (with the best of intentions no doubt). There is nothing to mitigate loss of expertise due to some or all of the current core developers retiring and being replaced by newer, less experienced developers. New developers may introduce weaknesses because they don’t have a full understanding of design decisions taken in the past. This would erode the value of the coin.
Compare to gold which properties are governed by the unchangeable laws of physics. Granted, gold has other issues (no hard cap for instance).

How did this work? Bitcoin script cannot (ever) take in external data. Feeding the correct price into the smart contract is unlikely to be trustless. So the parties do not have any guarantee that the correct price is going to be used at expiration.
This means that trust is introduced for the crucial step of establishing the payouts. Then, there is no advantage to making any other parts of the process trustless.
In other words, making the payment over a blockchain is pointless if the payouts are established centrally by a trusted third party (by means of feeding the price of the S&amp;P options contract into the smart contract). In that case, parties might just as well entrust the entire process to the trusted third party without using blockchain at all.
This can only work if there were a trustless way for establishing outcomes of real world events.

Do you mean: make the bitcoin unspendable? Then I’d argue it’d be better to leave them alone (and serve as a fund for QC research as a side-effect). At least it maximizes the time available to the original owner to move the coin. 
Or do you mean: keep bitcoin spendable by using original keys but in a way that breaking EC crypto is not sufficient to spend the coin? How would that be able to work?

It’s hard to motivate a corpse - my point is that switching to QC resistance is essential so that less coins will ultimately be possibly vulnerable.


Sure, anyone can claim it’s impossible - until it’s done. But fact is that advancements in QC are continued to be made and that it keeps creating uncertainty about the long term safety of Bitcoin.  Even if breaking ECC turns out never to be possible, it is impossible to rule it out, which is not very reassuring, especially given the years it will take to respond.

Nope. If Bitcoin fails, then that’s the end of cryptocurrency. Failure proofs that it is impossible to maintain consensus. Bitcoin basically is just a set of consensus rules. If these cannot be agreed on long term and cryptocurrencies just keep coming and going, then the entire concept has failed.
If Bitcoin becomes obsolete, its replacement can and will become obsolete as well. One can then rightfully conclude that cryptocurrencies are no better than fiat - their value ultimately becomes zero.

Interesting. But it is also correct to say that block 600,000 sets the total number bitcoins ever created at 18 million. The number of bitcoins ever mined is lower because the genesis block wasn’t mined (and arguably the first blocks having difficulty of 1 were also not mined).

In this industry the margin are thin due to the heavy competition. The [average profit margin]( is 5.2%. So a 5 buck cup nets only 26 cents.
Let’s assume that 2 out of 3 of the customers pay by credit card and that the processing fee is 3%. Then, accepting credit card takes 2% off the net margin. So a net margin of 5.2% would have been 7.2% if everyone paid cash. That means almost a 30% hit in net margin, eaten up by credit card fees alone (in this example).

An initial download of the entire blockchain is required for every node that wishes to operate without relying on trust.
This is a real cost in terms of cpu and bandwidth. This cost is born by node operators. Companies like Veriblock misappropriate blockchain space with a business model that intends to profit from this scarce resource but without paying the real cost, just a one-time fee that goes to the miners and not the node operators.
Node operators will be less inclined to run a node if they realize that they are offering a free resource to companies that seek to profit from it. Basically, it’s freeloading at the expense of node operators. That may undermine the system and thus spam must be discouraged, for instance by setting a minimum transaction fee once Lighning has matured.

In order of increasing impact and decreasing probability:

2. Design errors. Can also be solved with consensus although it would take some time and stop gap measures may be required.
3. Cryptographic assumptions no longer being valid. This is dangerous because it requires fast fixes while staying in consensus about what new cryptographic assumptions to take.
Much more impactful and potentially irresolvable would be break of consensus and a split in the developer community creating a competing coin that manages to get the best developers.
This is also unlikely because clearly, that would be the beginning of the end.
None of the current altcoins are any serious threat fortunately. But Bitcoin must continue to attract the best developers. This is a necessity for it to stay credible and survive.

**Don’t use bread during the days after the fork.**
Be aware that after the hardfork, bread will start showing your B2X balance as “BTC” in case B2X receives a majority of the mining power even for a short time.
This is great for scammers who can sell B2X for BTC prices to unsuspecting breadwallet users. The scammer sends B2X but the breadwallet user sees that they received BTC.
Transacting with breadwallet will be unsafe. It is not clear on which chain the coins will move as you don’t know whether you’re connected to Bitcoin nodes, B2X nodes or both.

Then the “why” - here I am making an educated guess. Why would a miner forfeit fees? If they can earn even more fees. Fee estimating algorithms were (and probably still are) easily gameable and I remember users complaining about their wallets fee estimates loudly. Maybe the situation has improved now.

Very kind, thank you!
I understand the sentiment but using BitcoinXT as a way to put pressure and try to force an outcome is reckless.
Bitcoin cannot be treated as a standard piece of software. It is achieving something that has never been possible before and as such it is on the cutting edge of computer science. I would say the field which allows Bitcoin to exist is still in the research phase. It is called an experiment for a reason - and experiments often fail because of unknowns.
Currently we face an unknown: no one can know the effects of a block size increase in terms of centralisation and the additional attack vectors such a change can introduce. Gavin went through great lengths to see the effects of increasing the block size to 8 MB using simulations and tireless testing. People at the forefront of computer science had endless debates about it. Such research and debate are no longer software development. This is typical for science.
So please don't treat Bitcoin as something that is missing your favorite feature that you'd like to see quickly implemented. Unless you understand the ramifications of such a change just let science run its course. If the experiment fails, so does your company.

This got me thinking. What would be the easiest and safest way to send a small amount bitcoin to someone not having a wallet?
Since we're talking about small amounts, how about being able to send an image which represents the private key (optionally with BIP-38 to password protect it).
What is required is a way to easily create such an image in a wallet, and for the wallet to read the image and create a transaction which sends the bitcoin to the wallet.
So for instance, I open up breadwallet, tap on "create image that is worth money" (but more nicely put), optionally lets me add password protection, and saves it to my photos. Then I use any messaging app to send the image to anyone new to bitcoin, who can download a wallet, import the image and enjoy being part of the Bitcoin community.
The image should clarify that it is worth money, and show a list of compatible wallets.

Not discussing blocksize, just pointing out a fallacy in reasoning.
But one of the effects of instant-doubling the blocksize and the sudden capacity increase it gives is that it quite possibly can drive fees to low levels instantly for a significant amount of time. Such a disruption of the fee market is undesirable.

Help me out here because you’re more knowledgeable than me. Exactly which coins will be vulnerable? What about coins for which the public key is known / address reuse? Genuine question.

Ok just for fun.
Number of days per year: 365.25 (assuming a 366-day year once ever 4 years).
Chance a person is born on a day other than Dec 31st: (365.25 - 1) / 365.25 = 99.73%
Chance for n persons being not born on dec 31st: (364.25 / 365.25)^n
For n = 
10: 97.3%
100: 76%
1000: 6.4%
10000: one in 806 billion
7 billion: zero, for all practical purposes.
So there will be villages of 1000 people where no one is born on dec 31st. But you won't likely find a town of 10,000 people where this is the case.

Yes, good riddance to these scientists that had a considerable contribution to where Bitcoin stands today.
Science is full of special personalities. But we need to argue about technical merits, not about personalities. It is a human emotion to start disliking a person who repeatedly disagrees with your views. But one of the arts of science is to look at the merits of the arguments at all times and to avoid ad hominems.
Finally: science is not a democracy. It is not driven by consensus. It takes only one scientist to shatter shared believes and proof that the earth is not the center of the universe.

To me, yes, it does, but mildly.
We are blessed having some of the best developers in the world working on Bitcoin. Let’s make no mistake: they are _not_ easily replaceable. The B2X fiasco is another big hint to this.
That these bright minds spend considerable time working on Bitcoin adds massively to the significance of the project.
But they are smart enough to understand that development should not be depending on just them. That’s why there is a BIP process which lowers the treshold for contributing to Bitcoin.
I am expecting the consensus layer to be locked up increasingly. Worst case all the developers that understand the consensus layer enough to meddle with it all die in a tragic plane crash. In that case, I suggest to stop make any changes for some time - Bitcoin is good enough as it is. Many improvements can happen in the layers on top of Bitcoin until there is a new generation of developers that can be trusted to make critical changes to Bitcoin again.
In a far future, I can see the consensus layer being totally locked. This would remove any fears of changes that are contentious or cause any bugs that require a hardfork to repair. That’s a day I look forward to.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:24:23
I still believe that moving fixed denominations would also work. So only ever move amounts of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, ... . It can be implemented as a wallet feature even but ofcourse preferably in the protocol such that amounts effectively become intractable.
My guess is also that if you combine this with enforcing that each address can only be used once, blockchain bloat would disappear as there no longer is history to be kept.
Conceptually, all information required for a wallet is a set of private keys to addresses each holding an amount in a fixed denomination (1, 2, 5, ...). Each address is always fully spent. A transaction would be a collection of addresses adding up to at least the transacted amount. Change comes back in fixed denominations as well.

Nope. If that were true then any block at the tip of the chain would be Bitcoin. A newly mined block by definition has the most accumulated hashpower. So if “most accumulated hashpower is Bitcoin” were the rule, then any new block would be valid regardless of its format.

No such believe exists. There is however the *fact* that bandwidth requirements to run a node have been growing while at the same time the number of nodes has been declining steadily.
The believe is that bigger blocks will increase bandwidth demands, which will in turn decrease the number of nodes.
Another believe is that if there will be too little number of nodes left, Bitcoin will have become too centralized and will be susceptible to very damaging attacks.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:19:11


Just because a small amount of bitcoin allows you to do something valuable, will not increase the value of bitcoin itself by much.
It is very comparable to the situation with gold. This metal obviously has a small number of extremely useful industrial purposes. However, that has only little impact on the value gold. Instead, golds' value is almost fully driven by speculation on (and hedging of) macroeconomic risk.

^^^^^^^^^^^^ This.
This is the first comment on the blocksize debate that I agree with from start to finish.
Yes, core devs should agree to general principles, being that the block size is constrained by bandwidth capacity and therefore its growth is constrained by bandwidth growth.
Also, perhaps agree on a size that the blocksize can be increased to without causing adverse effects to the network (increasing centralization being the main concern of course) and let it grow from there.

So, running XT keeps a node effortlessly on the longest valid chain. That in itself can be an important consideration to run XT. One however that does not necessarily indicate support for the hardfork.

It can not if you're talking about running a node. At the current block size of 1 MB, a full node uses 40 GB / day upstream.

It didn’t start from zero. Bcash started out with the entire Bitcoin user base. But since BCH are being sold off, the price went down.

“Overwhelming indisputed consensus” is impossible because the Core developers and their supporters will never recognize B2X as “Bitcoin” under _any_ circumstances. This was clear from the start.

Yep. And demand for near-free stuff that has any utility is unlimited. It’s basic economics. Roger seems to believe that the blocksize cap should be increased any time it is hit which is basically the same as removing it entirely.
He also believes spam doesn’t exist as long as the required fee is paid to get in a block. It won’t be long before someone spams Bcash blocks full with 1-satoshi-fee transactions. Can’t wait to see what will happen next. Block size increase, surely! It’ll be comical.

Running thousands of nodes within a single data center makes absolutely zero sense. These nodes may be running on machines a couple of feet apart or even be running on the same physical hardware. They do nothing useful for the network - they are mainly just ping ponging data back and forth within the same data center. A single node per data center location would be just as effective.

Yup. It confirms what most people suspected all along: B2X is not about transaction capacity, but about control.
Blocksize was simply picked as a wedge issue because it held the most promise to divide the community. The debate has been going on for years already.
It is a testament to the power of Bitcoin and the skills of their developers that even such a big issue is not able to destroy Bitcoin, not even when colluding with miners and buying half the ecosystem.

I admire Bitquick for their great brokering services, however I don't understand this post. I think that even though blocks are currently only half full on average, pretty much everyone agrees that there should be bigger blocks somewhere in the near future. Several proposals have been made of which Bitcoin XT is just one.
I am trying to understand why Bitquick sees Bitcoin XT as the way forward - it is a divisive and dangerous choice and not particularly a show of appreciation of the Core developers that contribute most to Bitcoin.
I don't see the need to solve the blocksize debate in a rush and without proper peer review and consensus.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:49:12
Just a random question. What would happen if every transaction always spent _all_ inputs (so, there is never any change output).
To spend the correct amount, the protocol can create a combination of outputs of values 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 ... etc. satoshi (these are mathematically the optimal denominations to create any amount using the least amount of “coins”).
Now, an output behaves just like a coin in the real world: its history no longer needs to be tracked. All we need to proof is that the sum of all coins doesn’t exceed the amount that is supposed to be in circulation.
One output being of a fixed value gives rise to other optimizations as well: Bitcoin only needs to keep a list of private keys for each denomination.
Wouldn’t such a scheme obsolete keeping track of a ledger?

You're misinformed. There is a 300 page report on HSBC which leaves little room for doubt that they knew exactly what was going on.
**Mexican drug barons**
Despite HSBC Mexico (HSMX) operating in a country "under siege from drug crime, violence and money laundering" it had inadequate money laundering controls.
Between 2007-8, for example, HBMX shipped $7bn to HSBC's US operation, more than any other HSBC affiliate.
Mexican and US authorities expressed concern that drug traffickers were able to circumvent the anti-money laundering controls at US banks by transporting US dollars to Mexico, and then using HBMX to transfer it to the US.
The committed report said HBMX had:
* high-profile clients involved in drug trafficking
* millions of dollars of suspicious bulk travellers cheques
* a resistance to closing accounts linked to suspicious activity
HSBC US (HBUS) nevertheless classed Mexico as a low-risk country and as a result, failed to properly monitor its transfers and other dealings with it.

With CLTV it will be possible to lock bitcoin a set amount of time during which it is impossible to spend them.
So Satoshi can make a series of transactions, each of which locks 1000 BTC. The first transaction would lock 1000 BTC for a week, the second one for two weeks, the third one for three weeks, and so on, for all estimated 1 million BTC.
Then, each week 1000 BTC will be released and become available for spending. Small problem would still be that he'd either need to convert the BTC to fiat, which has the risk that it can reveal his identity, or immediately relock any BTC after their lock expires. If he does neither, and all BTC would gradually become available for spending, then the problem of a large number of BTC hanging above the market would repeat itself.

I wouldn’t be surprised if this goes deeper than many suspect.
The block size is the first somewhat contentious issue in Bitcoin. It goes many years back and I recall Gavin Andresen proposing an increase to 20 MB per block. It never happened, but several parties might have tried to leverage the debate for their own agenda:
* Governments opposing Bitcoin trying to divide the community leading to an even split. Do this a couple times and Bitcoin is dead.
* Companies having a business model that depends on near-zero fees for data storage on the eternal blockchain. They think bigger blocks can avoid their business from failing.
* Altcoiners wanting to see Bitcoin fail and see their coin become  Contention within Bitcoin helps them.
* Chinese miners cq. BitMain blocking segwit and promoting larger blocks instead to protect their patented AsicBoost algorithm that hands them a decisive estimated 20% extra profit margin over the competition.

Instead and for this reason, most developers are not interested in working on altcoins and will instead port any advances that may exist in altcoins over to Bitcoin. In reality though the major advances happen in Bitcoin.

Segwit allows for a gradual and moderate increase in blocksize and comes combined with many other big improvements. An immediate doubling relative to segwit which is already a doubling would be reckless for a system that lends all of its value from being decentralized and therefore trustless.
Miners have proven to stuff blocks with transaction to game fee estimating algorithms. Miners [act completely selfish]( and will keep spamming if they think it earns them 1% more even after blocksize redoubles, harmfully bloating the blockchain twice as fast.

Private blockchain? That is not a trustless environment by definition, as there is a gatekeeper deciding who is allowed to use this private blockchain.
What is the purpose of using a private blockchain then, when you can as well use a distributed ledger without the mining and block reward mechanisms to make it trustless?
Perhaps with blockchain they do not refer to some trustless system but literally mean just a string of published hashes to make information verifiable to have not changed since the publication of the hash? Such methods exist for decades already.

Exchanges do their transactions off-chain. If you mean small shops selling their wares over the internet then yes, they are priced out currently. This is not a weakness. Disregarding spammig episodes - full blocks are a manifestation of the fact that there is more utility in other types of transactions than selling low-value items for Bitcoin.
Block space is a finite resource and a fee market is unavoidable for any successful system. There is undoubtedly a large demand for low-value transactions and this demand will incentivize the development of off-chain transacting solutions such as LN.

Agreed with the sentiment. I’d like to add that the previous bull run started right after the activation of segwit. Also, litecoin had segwit activated sooner and also experienced price increases right after segwit got activated.
The next catalyst might be the combined Schnorr, taproot and tapscript enhancements somewhere in 2021. I like to believe that technological progress is more important although I do believe that since halvings have a choking effect on supply, bull runs are able to go higher and not fall back to previous levels. I predict that this effect will slowly become less as the halvings become increasingly insignificant. At some point bull runs will become less extreme and after a bull run the price may fall back closer to pre-bullrun levels than is currently the case.

This would indeed be true for a car or a house, but not for a commodity. All gold, oil, silver and graded agricultural commodities are equivalent in value. Your bar of gold is of exactly the same value as mine (of the same weight and purity of course) and the gold sold on the market.
This is a unique property of any commodity: they are uniform and interchangeable and priced exactly the same. I don't have to sell my barrel of oil in the market to know its price - the exact same oil is continuously being sold on exchanges so I know the price and thus the value already before transacting.

The network effect definitely applies to Bitcoin. The more people use it, the more utility it will have for each individual.
Right now, Bitcoin is in its infancy. The utility of Bitcoin is as a hedge against rising risks in the banking system as seen in Cyprus in 2013 and Greece some weeks ago. Also, Bitcoin is used to speculate and by companies for enabling cheaper remittances.
The network effect present here is that the more utility Bitcoin gains, the more people will find it useful and start using it. That in turn will persuade more businesses to offer Bitcoin related services, which in turn will cause more people to adopt Bitcoin.
At some point, the number of people using Bitcoin may grow so large that mainstream businesses appear that can exclusively be used with Bitcoin. At that point, the utility of Bitcoin skyrockets. Using Bitcoin no longer is a gimmick, it has become a necessity for a large group of people that want to be able to buy the services or goods of a Bitcoin-only business. No longer are people getting into Bitcoin just for thrills, speculation or macro-hedging, but need to get into Bitcoin to be able to buy that Bitcoin-only offering.
Add to this the following factors:
* Advances are continuously making Bitcoin easier and safer to use. We now have relatively secure smartphone wallets and super secure hardware wallets, as well as Bitcoin ATMs. There are FDIC insured exchanges now.
* Advances in the Bitcoin protocol will increase the potential utility of Bitcoin. For instance, a seemingly small enhancement that enables locking up Bitcoin for a set period of time might enable techniques that allows instant transactions and orders of magnitude more transactions (more technically: CLTV enabling the Lightning network).
* Increased utility combined with more ease of use leads to increased adoption. This cannot other than cause a run-up in the price, which will attract a lot of attention and will very likely create another speculative bubble.
* Hedge funds and investment banks may at some point add Bitcoin to their investment portfolios. There are now ETNs and sooner or later an ETF will see the light. I will leave it to your imagination how adoption by the finance industry is going to affect the price.
TL;DR: There is undeniably a network effect. Bitcoin is demonstrably growing in utility and becoming safer and more user friendly which is fanning adoption. This may increase the price, lead to another bubble, more attention, and more adoption. It is just a matter of time before the finance industry comes on board, which will do a little something to the price as well.

Ok, that's pretty dumb. The value can change without any transaction taking place. If the bid and ask move lower, the value already goes down. No transaction required.
Suppose trading in a stock is halted. Then, it is announced that the CEO of that company committed suicide. At what moment does the stock go down in value? When trading resumes? That'd be retarded. No, the value plummets as soon as the news hits. Even when there are no transactions taking place.

Gold price changes from second to second, even. But that is irrelevant as well. The value of gold at some point in the future is not known to anyone obviously.

I'm sad to read that the negativity starts to affect Core devs. It is understandable too.
It is remarkable how the buttcoiners disappeared from the scene and seem to have been replaced by people that seem ungrateful and act entitled. It is tempting think that this is not a coincidence. There is a remarkably loud group on Reddit that wants a max block size immediately and receives tens of upvotes instantly for their mostly ill-informed posts. I witness reasonable posts with counter arguments being downvoted in the tens as well. This is not typical even for r/bitcoin.
If I want to be negative, I'd say that detractors have organized and found a weak spot in the system: human psychology. But it seems far fetched. Another possibility is that a large group of people see the 1 MB block size cap as what is blocking the price frim going up and get impatient. Perhaps in their minds a larger capacity of the network will propel the price and finally make them rich. In other words: greed. I often see "Visa-levels" of transactions mentioned as some sort of end-goal, which Bitcoin must achieve it else it has failed in their opinion. That is as ridiculous as it is unreasonable.
Then there is the coup d'etat of Mike and Gavin. I must say it seems as if they misuse the opportunity of the apparent dissent in the Bitcoin community to get themselves in a more influential role and seem to attempt to sideline the other core devs. It would be a very dangerous precedent if they'd succeed.
I can only hope that Core devs can keep a level head and approach the current crisis diligently. I would like to encourage them to never give up and always think about the next best move in the long term interest of Bitcoin. I have ultimate faith in that small group of Core devs that brought Bitcoin to where it is today.

That’s the holy grail of Bitcoin. LN is the only solution that I am aware of that can truly scale. Block size increases are not going to cut it. Even if we can get a safe 10-fold capacity increase, it’s nowhere near the capacity of an ubiquitous global payment system.
Having this knowledge, it is smarter to look for feasible scaling options that scale off-chain instead of pushing bigger blocks that are a dead-end when it comes to facilitating mass-adoption levels of transactions and that have the very real potential to centralize the system enough to destroy it.

Nonsense, SEPA has not been disabled. It works just fine for the rest of Europe.
Recent price jumps coincided exactly with events in Greece. Up to the minute. This is Greece - granted, probably not by the Greek themselves buying and selling. However the Greek capital controls and rumours of a 30% "haircut" on Greek bank deposits over EUR 5000 undermine trust in fiat.
Again a group of people has come to the realisation that money in the bank has a real risk of being confiscated. Capital controls happened before in Cyprus in 2013 and the price increased almost tenfold.
With the new "bail in" legislation, depositors will be losing large parts their deposits in case of a bank default. It is a great way to promote bank runs. The money in the bank is perhaps not that safe anymore.
This is all about decreasing trust in fiat, governments and banks, nothing else.

No central control, not inflatable, trustless. It is a money free of government meddling.
The trustless part is equally significant: sending someone coin is like handing physical dollar bills to someone standing right next to you. No one can prevent it, no one will know about it, and provided the necessary precautions are taken, no one will ever be able to find out about it. As an added bonus Bitcoin enables you to send money to anyone regardless of location.

It’s disingenuous to suggest development is centralized for a project that has over a hundred contributors. It is true that some developers are more influential than others.

@_date: 2015-07-25 21:28:19
I know it is counterintuitive.
The key difference is that the newly created asset is trustless and therefore has no initial seller. At creation, it cannot be purchases from someone or from a company. Still it needs to be issued in such a way that it gets priced transparently and fairly.
It is comparable to Bitcoin itself. Value is destroyed (mainly electricity) to trustlessly obtain bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-26 02:57:08
The key difference is that the newly created asset is trustless and therefore has no initial seller.


Selling means having to pay someone. In that situation, the asset is by definition initially completely under the control of the seller, since the seller was able to create these units alone and for just themselves. Apparently no one else was able to create the asset as it can initially only be bought from a central seller. At that point the asset is no longer trustless because the purchaser has to trust the seller that:
* They actually release the asset after paying;
* They did not secretly create more of the asset that they keep to themselves to sell later, which can make everyone's holdings almost worthless due to inflation;
* They do not manipulate the asset in any other way such that its value is adversely affected.
The only way to issue an asset trustlessly is by creating the asset such that the amount is known and fixed, and everyone is able to acquire the asset from the moment of inception.
This is exactly true for Bitcoin and Counterparty, but not for instance for Ripple.

The keyspace is limited by the length of the private key and does not increase by using a larger keyspace for the seed.

It's mentioned in the [capacity roadmap]( published in December 2015 (emphasis mine):
"at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough. Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around **moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8** rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them."

Another way is to reduce the number of non-Bitcoin transactions by companies that parasitically use Bitcoin infrastructure as if it were free in the way air is free.
There are too many low-value transactions that bloat the blockchain, increase traffic requirements for nodes and so hurt the value of Bitcoin-the-currency.

Developers with knowledge of the matter coming to compromises amongst themselves cannot be compared to almost the entire Bitcoin ecosystem giving in to the demands of a tiny fraction (a self-mining ASIC manufacturer) that happens to be in the unsettlingly powerful position to resist segwit.
If it wasn't for BitMain and Jihan Wu's control of possibly over 50% of all hashpower, we would likely have had segwit and LN would be having tremendous momentum by now. Wallet improvements, MAST and Schnorr signatures might have already been released or close.

No, someone else creates a new financial asset which is divisable in units.

* Established players have the resources to abuse the patent system as well as the legal system to stifle smaller competitors and innovation;

The statement says "properly incentivized". I can't see anything wrong with that. There has to be some sort of incentive to run a node, or else there won't be any nodes. The statement does not mention that the incentive should be financial. So it may for instance also be an ideological incentive.

We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals.

Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt.

On the 9th slide (UASF Scenario - Day d+2):
"UASF-miners make more profit than Old-Miners"
Really? If Old-Miners mine blocks more quickly than UASF-Miners, then they earn more coinbase rewards. So even though the Old-Miners' coins are worth less, the faster block rate offers more coins and more profit to share.
Rational miners would then switch to the original chain that mines blocks faster, slowing down UASF-chain even more, causing more miners to join mining the original chain.
This scenario would cause the UASF-chain to fail. So I don't think the slides are correct here.
The difficulty will initially be the same for both chains. So the cost to find a block is equal for both chains. The higher price per coin on the UASF chain makes it more profitable to mine UASF-coin. This causes miners to rejoin the UASF-chain until mining becomes equally profitable on both chains. Just like the slides indicate. The chains will attract an amount of hash rate that is proportional to the price of the coin.
The fact that Jihans covert AsicBoost miners can mine 20% cheaper probably also has some effects in the equation.
Hopefully Greg Maxwells' [Covert-AsicBoost-killer-BIP]( will be in effect before the UASF. More hopefully, Jihan Wu becomes supportive of segwit after Gregs' BIP activates because the incentive to stall segwit will be gone.

Likely any max blocksize increase would be by implementing extension blocks which is a softfork. While that removes the objections of a hardfork, the question remains whether it would have more support than the current one.
Do you have any evidence to support that sw2mb has more support than segwit? Jihan Wu will still not support it for instance because he misguidedly thinks segwit and LN will eat his lunch.
So there's not likely to be any progress in terms of miner support when changing to sw2mb.

The actual price I receive is irrelevant. The point is that I can know exactly how much the jeweller will pay for the clump of gold. If I refine it myself into 99.999% pure gold, then I can be sure that I will be able to sell it for just a tad below spot. So I know that my clump of gold is exactly worth the gold price minus fixed, non-gold price related expenses (cost to obtain the clump, refine it, plus the jewellers' margin).

Bitcoin can be considered a word such as “gold”, “oil”, “sand”, “wheat”, “money” which are uncountables. So, “one gold, two oils”, “three moneys” doesn’t make sense. Similar for bitcoin (lowercase):
“I have some bitcoin in my wallet”
Where bitcoin (lowercase b) refers to the token, Bitcoin (uppercase B) refers to the protocol:

A miner can insert any transaction in a block. They can insert their own and craft it such that it allows AsicBoosting. Some transaction reordering takes place in blocks as well.

I think you have that backwards. If Core devs start to disagree amongst themselves, it has every potential to split Bitcoin in two by means of a contentious hardfork. For instance, if Core devs were split 50/50 between 2 MB blocks first or SegWit first, then half of the Core devs can create a fork and abandon Bitcoin Core. Both forks will consider themselves to be the best progression for Bitcoin but effectively there would be two coins, both having a value that is only a small fraction of the current value. It would take years to get over such a split, if it would be ever possible. I think most people will call it quits.
On the other hand, if the community disagrees with the Core devs, but the Core devs themselves agree on the way forward, then there is no danger of any fork and Bitcoin can just progress naturally along the roadmap outlined by the devs. And who is "the community" anyway? There will always be groups who have differing views on how to go forward. But as long as they are not part of the Bitcoin Core dev team, their position is harmless and does not impede Bitcoin development at all.

Bitcoin as-is cannot replace VISA ever. It simply is not possible to process and store 10,000 tps on the blockchain. This should be easy to understand.
The discussion is about increasing the capacity of Bitcoin by a modest factor of two. Some perceive blocks as becoming increasingly full and are afraid Bitcoin growth may stall. Some of them are in favor of lifting the block size limit to 2 MB, allowing for blocks twice as big. The downside is that larger blocks increase the bandwidth requirements of full nodes. The number of full nodes has be in decline despite increased adoption. Further drops in the number of nodes leads to increased centralisation which is a risk to Bitcoin as a whole.
Others therefore are in favor of Segwit which scales more elegantly as well as solves a number of other issues in one go.
The ultimate solution is to settle small transactions in bulk using Lightning Network or other payment layers built on top of Bitcoin. These represent actual scaling solutions and preserve the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

A PoW algo change may not help much to battle the BitMain dominance. Mining is not just about hardware but also data centers and access to cheap electricity. BitMain has the money to replace their miners and fill their datacenter with GPUs that mine cheaper than anyone elses due to cheap electricity and the sunk cost of setting up a data center. They'd likely again become dominant.
Also, a PoW algo change has a long lead time in which BitMain might be able to start producing ASICs that accelerate parts of the new PoW algo even before it goes live which would give them an instant head-start.
I used to think a PoW change was an easy solution to get rid of dominant miners, but now I am not so sure about this for the reasons mentioned.

I don't think that this would suddenly cause the number of transactions to explode.

Creating a Bitcoin transaction with the sole purpose of storing data in OP_RETURN and not to transact value is abuse, even more so if it is to support some ill-conceived business model that assumes profitability by externalizing cost to node operators. It is absurd to believe that any business model allows for the huge costs of continuously storing data in the blockchain, especially given that it does not scale. Any business depending on cheap blockchain space is doomed to fail.
This is so glaringly obvious that one has to wonder whether other more nefarious motives exist.

Also, consider that if “chain having most accumulated hashpower defines Bitcoin” were true, then _any_ block mined on top of the previous block would redefine “Bitcoin” as by definition any new block will be having the most accumulated hash power.
This clearly shows that consensus rules cannot be decided by miners because that would mean that invalid blocks no longer exist - whatever they mine would be valid by definition and redefine Bitcoin.

The argument has always been that B2X does not require replay protection because it is the “real” Bitcoin.  I believe jgarzik mentioned this explicitly in the btc1 github although I wasn’t able to find it.

“This issue is for discussing the technicals of an implementation that would work for segwit2x. The goal of segwit2x is to upgrade Bitcoin - to be Bitcoin - not create an altcoin.”
The thread below from june is also interesting. It indicates that many exchanges _did_ ask for replay protection. Amongst other things, Jgarzik defends why no replay protection is being added.
Edit 2: just dropping two more quotes of jgarzik:

It invites added risk to update wallets that would otherwise not need to be updated.” (Source: [reddit](

Multiple clients is fine as long as they incorporate the same consensus engine. There is an ongoing effort by Core to move the consensus rules to a separate library called libconsensus. Once this library is available, an alternative client can use it and be certain that it is using the same consensus rules as Bitcoin Core.
Multiple implementations of libconsensus would make no sense at all. The alternatives would have to be bug-by-bug compatible with libconsensus.

Is this survey indifferent to the publisher of the news? Because that makes all the difference.
News is just that: a new fact. How and by who it is reported makes all the difference. I trust Bloomberg for their dry, factual, opinionless and unbiased reporting. They are really on one end of a spectrum where FOX News for instance sits on the other. I find that well respected newspapers also have either a leftish or rightish bias. Once you know what to look for, it is easy to spot.
As for your survey, the very reason you are doing one already tells me that you have a bias and likely believe Bitcoiners perceive and interpret news differently from the average person. And you are likely right, but you would find the same result if you would do the same survey amongst people with for instance a degree. So you have to be careful to what you conclude. But I can already predict the outcome: "Bitcoiners less likely to believe news articles than average person", which can be spinned into making anyone involved into Bitcoin look like a bit of a nutcase.
So, good luck, and ~~no, I am not~~ perhaps I will do your survey to see for myself.

The tradeoff is the introduction of a minimal amount of trust when using LN in exchange for VISA scale transaction capacity. That's a great tradeoff, and shows that LN is a viable and actual scaling solution, unlike bigger blocks which is just a stopgap solution that cannot scale to VISA levels and on top of that has the much worse tradeoff of risking increased centralisation.

From the perspective of Bitcoin Core, it is the only consensus which matters.


Yes, that's indeed right. The longest chain is established according to the consensus rules as programmed into Bitcoin Core.
To create consensus, it has to be clear what should be agreed upon, *and by whom*. It is meaningless to say "there is no consensus because Brian Armstrong disagrees". He is not amongst the group of people that are critical for the further development of Bitcoin Core, so if he is not in agreement, then tough luck, Bitcoin Core can just carry on. Consensus does not mean that everyone on Reddit must agree before Core can continue.
On the other hand, if Core devs were to disagree amongst themselves about a consensus rule, then this would be a much more problematic situation that will need to be resolved.

I appreciate the effort to clarify, but I do well understand this.
Maybe best to illustrate by example.
Private key: 2 bits of entropy (0-3);
Seed: 2 bits of entropy (0-3);
Mnemonic: 5 bits of entropy (0-31).
Now even though the mnemonic is 5 bits, 3 bits are redundant. Each mnemonic represents a pk value between 0 and 3. So, out of the 32 possible mnemonic values, an expected 8 will resolve to the pk. So each guess has 1 in 4 chance of being the pk, and not 1 in 32.
Likewise for the seed. If its entropy is 2 bits, then a mnemonic of more than 2 bits does not reduce the chances of guessing the seed to below 1 in 4.

You make it sound like a block size increase is not a big deal. However it puts a lot of pressure on the remaining full nodes in the network because of the increased bandwidth requirements. And the node count has already been steadily declining despite increased adoption.

The foo-tokens differ fundamentally from bitcoin. They are mere IOUs and their value is unrelated to the soundness and stability of Bitcoin. The coinbase is in BTC, foo-IOUs are not awarded. So the situation is absolutely not symmetrical.
I don't think storing IOUs in the Bitcoin blockchain will take off because it suffers from the issues of any system that is not trustless (so what that you have an IOU saying this is your car? Here's a piece of paper saying it is *my* car. Oh, so you think this is your car? Come get it but I will kill you first. And btw, I don't have this car, I *just* happened to bring it to the scrapyard).

That would be an improvement. But even better would be the assurance to the end-user that a payment is virtually never blocked due to insufficient fees.

The USA is in the uniquely advantageous position to be minting the worldwide reserve currency.
The temptation to abuse this position is huge. As you note, other countries are scrambling to buy near-zero and subzero USA interest rate treasuries. The main reason is the perceived strength of the USD and the USA economy.
The USA can just rack up debt knowing that there are always buyers. But at some point, if debt balloons too high, buyers will start to demand more interest because they start to see a risk of USA having to mint more USD to be able to pay back the trillions of debt, causing inflation and devaluation of the USD.
Now if the USD starts to devalue, even if it is a little, everyone holding the USD as its reserve currency will feel the pain. Ofcourse, now countries will no longer be willing to lend USA their money against near-zero or negative rates.
The interest rate will start to go up for the USA. Now even the slightest increase on trillions of USA debt will be felt. Ofcourse the USA can keep minting USDs until the cows come home, debasing the currency and making their debt easy to pay off.
There will be consequences however: high inflation and quickly rising interest rates. The knock-on effects can become dramatic as the world has become addicted to near-zero interest rates.
A next financial crisis starting with real estate plummeting in value and banks needing bailouts is likely to materialize, likely starting in places where loan-to-value is highest - Hong Kong and China come to mind.

Consensus in the context of Bitcoin Core development means consensus amongst the people working on Core (generally the developers).
It does *not* mean:
* Consensus amongst all players in the Bitcoin ecosystem
* Consensus between r/btc and r/bitcoin
* Consensus between everyone that can spell the word Bitcoin
With all due respect for Brian Armstrong but his position is irrelevant to Bitcoin Core because development will not be negatively impacted by it. He is on the sidelines. Bitcoin development can carry on unimpeded as long as developers agree amongst themselves on the way forward. That is the kind of consensus that is desired, and for the sake of Bitcoin Core it is the only relevant consensus.

If you're arguing for 10 MB blocks, then:
* You do have to argue why this does not cause increased centralization.
* You do have to argue why you see an imminent need for this.
* You do have to argue why the current capacity increases on the drawing board would be insufficient.
* You do have to convince the 100+ Core devs that have made Bitcoin into a 21 billion currency and which runs without interruption despite constantly being under attack from all angles that they do not have to be so conservative.

Unless I discover the pattern. Then I can predict all your numbers and they are no longer random to me.
It is the difference between random and pseudorandom.
A set of pseudorandom numbers is indistinguishable from random. For instance the SHA256 operation creates a pseudorandom number. As inputs you can use 1, 2, 3, ... and the output would seem random to me.
But if I discover that you are using SHA256 and the inputs you use, then there's no randomness any longer.
However if you gave me truly random numbers created from noise, then I will never be able to predict the sequence as there is no pattern.

However arguably much worse currency risk exists for the currencies of Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, China, Ukraine, Zimbabwe and many more countries.

The original vision is to devise [a *peer-to-peer* electronic cash system]( The mention of peer-to-peer in the very title of the Bitcoin whitepaper is crucial and often understated or missed altogether.
Peer-to-peer demands a *trustless* system for transferring value. Being trustless is what sets Bitcoin apart, not being another payment system. As you likely well know, there are already tons of electronic payment systems and it seems like a new one is announced every other month.
~~So no, Bitcoin has not failed according to the original vision of Satoshi even if the transaction fee were to reach USD 10.~~
Edit: After reading the first section of the whitepaper again, I noticed this line:
"The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services."
This does imply that he was concerned with transaction costs, although I believe he first and foremost invented Bitcoin enable trustless transactioning, but saw low-fee transactions as an additional collateral benefit worth mentioning. So you may have a point if you say low-fee transactions were part of his original vision, although he saw it as a mere consequence of Bitcoin being trustless.

RBF complicates using Bitcoin. Who wants to monitor their payment and to see if it comes through and take awkward actions to retry the payment if it fails?

There's the magic!
The buyer can be 100% certain that the seller has found the correct solution. That's the first piece of magic. The buyer just can't access it. To get access the buyer must pay the seller first.
Now comes the second piece of magic. The very act of paying gives the buyer access to the solution - the seller does not need to do anything, in fact he cannot prevent the buyer from receiving the correct solution after he paid.
So this is a fully trustless exchange: the buyer knows that if he pays, he will receive the correct solution.
@_date: 2016-02-15 13:11:14


No they don't. Also the fees go into the pockets of the miners. Node operators receive nothing even though they incur costs for making Bitcoin at all possible. And even if they were all paying fees, then that does not magically make it ok for these companies to repurpose Bitcoin for their own profits, while at the same time filling up blocks and by that drive up the transaction fees for everyone else.


I don't think this will ever happen, but even if it would, then I would argue that Bitcoin has not failed, on the contrary, it has been hugely successful. After all, people apparently are prepared to pay significant fees for the privilege of doing a Bitcoin transaction. In reality of course there would be an equilibrium at a fee rate that remains trivially low.

Here's the trick: the buyer already has the answer. The seller sent it to him. But it is encrypted. The buyer can verify whether the answer is correct thanks to ZK magic. It is possible to verify the correctness of the answer despite the fact that it is encrypted! Also, the buyer can be certain that by paying, the Bitcoin network will reveal the correct decryption key without any additional action by the seller required.

That is great news. Note how the price resumed to increase. We want segwit.
But just for the record - does that mean you are dismissing sw2mb as an option? Because Adam Back convincingly explained that this option can't happen any time soon because it requires a hardfork. And that's regardless of the question whether it can reach consensus at all, which is unlikely.
The fastest way to segwit is getting the remaining miners on board to signal it. The second fastest is UASF. Do you also see it like this?

I think it is safe to say *everyone* wants a *capacity* increase, and segwit is exactly that. Schnorr signatures is another 30% capacity increase. LN offloads the blockchain, again more capacity.
Some Core devs indicated that it wanted to see the effects of this 2.6 times capacity increase before going ahead with more risky changes to increase capacity further. Makes all the sense in the world to me.
Clearly sabotaging segwit cannot be about wanting more capacity than offered, but about something completely else, and Jihan Wu has admitted that he's worried about his profits and want to protect his interests to the detriment of everyone else.
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:27:01


It's because Bitmains' advantage relies on a flaw that to continue to exist requires much of Bitcoin staying as it is. That in turn is giving Bitmain a USD multi-million reason to sabotage protocol enhancements such as segwit and hurting the entire Bitcoin ecosystem in the process.
Their advantage also enables them to outmine everyone else and put other miners out of business, which would give them full control over Bitcoin which can only be undone by a PoW algo change.
So yes, the sky was indeed falling. This was - and still is - a dangerous episode in the history of Bitcoin and one that must be prevented in the future.

Surprised to see that your comment was deleted. Anyway here is my response.


Voting is done by hash power, this is fundamental to Bitcoin. The chain which attracts the most hash power is the one that wins.


Today we can detect hardforks as well. There is no need to pause the network - hash power will vote and continue to extend the blockchain from the block which they regard to be on the valid chain.
Suppose at some point in time, libconsensus finds block A to be valid, but libalternate finds the block to be invalid. In that case, the hash power using libalternate will reject block A and continue to search for a block A' while libconsensus marches on by extending block A.
Once libalternate finds block A', the hash power supporting libalternate can continue to try to extend what they regard to be the valid chain. This situation is a hardfork, as there are now two chains and each chain considers itself to be valid and the other one invalid.
Now it is not a good idea to just pause the network and call a meeting between consensus rule implementators to figure out who is right. This can take hours or days, which is unacceptable outage. Instead, the hash power will decide which chain is valid. If disagreement persists, that means there will be two competing coins.

@_date: 2017-04-25 11:11:26
How about extending the protocol such that a transactions can enforce to only be included into a block based on what is signalled?
So, for instance say I want to support segwit. I create a transaction such that a block including my transaction can only be valid if it also signals segwit. If the miner creating the block does not, then the block will be invalid if my transaction were included.
So non-segwit signalling miners cannot include my transaction.
 ... would this be a sane thing to implement? More power to the users...
EDIT never mind... this is not a good idea at all. It can be gamed and worse.... powerful miners can pressure users into signalling things they don't want.

This has always been the position of the Core devs: let's first see how segwit pans out before increasing the block size further.
Segwit is a 2 times capacity increase and Schnorr signatures would increase that further to a total of 2.6 times. Plus Lightning Network offers a fast off-chain payments layer on top of the slow on-chain settlement layer.
Not to mention the malleability fix, allowing better wallets.
Bitmain and Jihan Wu are getting increasingly isolated in their anti-segwit position. The time has come for them to rejoin the side of progress and support segwit today. Even more so because covert AsicBoost will not be possible for much longer thanks to Greg Maxwells BIP proposal. UASF can force segwit activation as well.

How is this evidenced? I can just as well argue that it will attract more spam transactions instead, bloating the blockchain.


Despite increasing adoption, node count has been on a very long declining trend. There isn't any evidence that increased adoption also increases the number of full nodes.


Bigger blocks won't stop that. What *does* help is having Lightning Network as an alternative to do transactions that are also instant and cheap.


Space on the blockchain is a scarce resource. The price is set by market demand. Having the highest fees merely attests to the popularity of Bitcoin.


Yes it does. Schnorr signatures is another 30% capacity increase. A doubling of the blocksize is also being considered but not after seeing how segwit pans out.


No one can be "kicked out" - Bitcoin development is open to everyone and not some closed group.


Blockstream is funded by AXA Strategic Ventures. AXA is an insurance company, not a bank. It is true that we must be vigilant given the potential of misaligned incentives.

The optimization itself is not the issue. The problem is that it creates undesirable side effects.

The price of gold is not related to the cost of mining it, as can be easily seen. If new, large gold deposits were to be discovered, the price of gold would drop.
Reversely, if a crisis hits and demand for gold skyrockets, the price would as well.
In general, the price of a good is not related to the cost of producing it. When maximizing profits, the price of anything that is for sale is completely driven by the laws of supply and demand.

PoW is inherently centralizing. A small advantage over the competition can potentially be enough to gain all hash power by driving up the difficulty until mining become unprofitable for less efficient competitors.
I believe that it would be helpful to a modify the PoW algo such that the manufacturer of the ASIC chip that found a block can be known by examining the block.
If a single manufacturer becomes too powerful and abusive or attacks the network then nodes can start rejecting any blocks found by their rigs, effectively bricking them. The network marches on with the remaining well-behaving mining hardware.
The threat of nodes being able to brick hardware on manufacturer basis completely turns the tables. Manufacturers will then have every incentive to avoid that their mining rigs can be abused and will want to prevent that any single party reaches 50% of hash power with their rigs.
Is this technically possible? I believe so - there might be ways for instance by enforcing signing of an ASIC-specific block hash with a hardware embedded private key, and have the public key be published on the website of the manufacturer.

Segwit means the end for covert AsicBoost. Bitmain uses AsicBoost on the hardware level in its mining rigs. So that's why they are vehemently against segwit even though everyone else in the Bitcoin ecosystem wants it.

Even simpler: a wallet can release multiple timelocked dependent transactions at once. The transactions to be included in a later block carry a higher fee. Once a transaction ends up in a block, the later transactions automatically become invalid.
It's like selling your transaction to the highest bidder.  And the wallet doesn't need to stay online.

Have to disagree.
If the keyspace of a seed is 512 bits, then guessing every single private key used for a transaction is easier. 
Each transaction has a keyspace of 128 bits. So, 2^20 = about 1 million transactions occupy a keyspace of 128 + 20 = 148 bits. So, guessing the pk of transactions one by one is infinitely easier than guessing the seed.

Can’t trust be eliminated entirely by settling up for every price movement using a mutual LN channel?
So A enters into a futures contract with B. Both agree on an oracle. After every tick, an LN payment is made. Let’s say the price moves in A’s favour. Then for that tick, B pays A to settle up.
This can improved by both parties pledge an amount equal to the biggest expected payment for any one tick. If B wouldn’t have settled up with A, then A receives B’s pledged amount.

The BitMain specific covert AsicBoost advantage will soon be history after a fix as proposed by Greg Maxwell is deployed in hopefully Bitcoin Core 0.14.2.
At that point, a level playing field between miners can begin to be restored, however it will not be level for a while - BitMain likely recovered all fixed costs associated with being able to manufacture mining equipment whereas competitors might not.
So, the cost base for the mining equipment that BitMain produces is likely lower than that of competitors.
A new generation of mining equipment may go a long way in restoring the level playing field although the cost base of BitMains production facilities may remain lower due to their massive profits they enjoyed (and still enjoy today) due to their asicboost advantage.
It's as if BitMain was being subsidized to do research and build production facilities whereas competitors had to foot the bill themselves.
It might take some time until things return to normalcy.

There is no reason to trust Jihan / Bitmain. He has every incentive to find an excuse to withdraw his support before actual activation.

In case Bitcoin Core implements support for 2 MB blocks (inevitably by means of a hardfork) then the decision logic renders True.
If the bet intends to only render true if Bitcoin Classic causes a hardfork then the decision logic is flawed.

Thanks OP, I couldn't agree more.
It looks very much like an attempt to divide the community by offering a seemingly reasonable "compromise" that is not at all reasonable or even feasible at this point.
Whoever came up with the ridiculous sw2mb  proposal apparently wants to make it seem as if there are two sides of which they are the more reasonable one.
But there are no two sides - an overwhelming majority of the ecosystem stands behind the current 100+ developers of Bitcoin and their technical choices.
And that choice is to have segwit (2 times capacity increase), then Schnorr signatures (another 30% capacity increase) and enable Lightning Network (offloading transactions from the blockchain). That is a total of 2.6 times more capacity plus the abilty to offload small-value (coffee) transactions.
Not to mention all the other improvements in privacy, performance and user experience that segwit offers.
Some core devs have indicated already that they are open to look at a 2 times blocksize increase after evaluating the effects of the 2.6 times increase that segwit and Schnorr signatures gives us. In all respects a sane and reasonable position which has overwhelming support.
I am not too hopeful that armchair engineers tossing "compromises" around on twitter and reddit will go away. I suppose they like the attention of being a "voice of reason" or perhaps just want to troll, or may even have interests at stake. Whatever it is, the community must fight them by pointing out the facts and standing behind Bitcoin's current dev team and their choices.
I am happy to see that many important players in the ecosystem have explicitly stated their support. This is crucial and disarms detractors like these.

The fix proposed by Greg Maxwell destroys Jihans' formerly secret advantage just like activating segwit would.
So after the fix, segwit (and other protocol enhancements) no longer take any BitMain specific mining advantages away. 
That means Jihan no longer has any economic incentive to be against segwit. He might still continue to sabotage it though, however that would be quite disgraceful and pointless.
After the fix, a level playing field for miners would be restored. The BitMain hashrate can be expected to drop although I am wondering how exactly that would play out.
Likely, the mining equipment which had the secret advantage would have to be converted back into regular miners that use 20% more energy. The speed of hashing would however not change I believe unless mining equipment is being switched off.
It's going to be interesting for sure. Never a dull day in Bitcoinland.

Irrelevant. Anyone can start an altcoin that has the Bitcoin genesis block as a starting point.


No. An altcoin is a coin having differing consensus rules compared to Bitcoin. So, BU is an altcoin.


No. Any node can start creating blocks at ten times the current speed by applying a difficulty that is ten times as low. This node quickly creates the longest chain. But guess what - its chain and all of its blocks will be ignored by the network because the consensus rules weren't followed.
Same for BU. They apply alternate consensus rules. That makes them an altcoin. Their blocks will be ignored by non-BU nodes, and non-BU hashpower will continue to mine the Bitcoin blockchain. Irregardless of the amount of blocks BU has.

Excuse my ignorance, but how exactly is this an advantage over activating segwit, which also "gets SegWit done"?

Define what a miner is. Because mining pool operators are not. They are just facilitating the owners of hashing equipment and it is them that do the actual mining.
Hashers can simply point their mining power to a different mining pool if a pool misbehaves. Pools have as much power as the company operating the power grid. Pools just facilitate, nothing more.

The issue is about replacing the tens of developers in the Core dev team and the proven governance model of Bitcoin with a small, rather ad-hoc group of people some of whose qualifications are questionable and with a supposedly democratic governance model which can easily be gamed.


Segwit offers about the same doubling of transaction capacity as well as a host of other significant improvements such as a fix for malleability which allows for a smooth implementation of Lightning Network, a *real* solution to scaling. Apart from that, increasing the maximum block size to 2 MB is on the scalability roadmap of Bitcoin Core.

I hope Bruce now understands how naive he has been to defend a "compromise".
Although no one understood the motives, it was clear that these "compromises" were made in bad faith because they didn't make any technical or logical sense.
In addition, it would have been damaging to cater to demands of a single party that happens to be in the position to sabotage progress of Bitcoin. It is like compromising with an extortionist while not doing anything to prevent them from extorting you again in the future.
Lastly, there was not any need to "compromise" as there were other avenues around unwilling miners that are not any significant party when it comes to having a say in how Bitcoin should function. All they were asked was to signal readyness for segwit. Nothing more.
It is clear now that in case the "compromise" that Bruce naively was in favor of had been accepted, Bitmain and Jihan Wu would have been able to continue to monopolize mining and increase their ability to viciously attack Bitcoin with a majority of hashpower while pushing other miners out of the market.

Nonsense. A single implementation does not create a single point of failure.


No it is not. It would be "a menace to the network" as Satoshi put it. To avoid unintentional forks, the consensus layer must be exactly the same across all nodes and miners. It has to be bug-compatible.
If it were not, then it would become possible to create a malicious transaction that forks the chain into two - one that accepts the block with the malicious transaction and another one rejecting it.

It can take longer than 8 years before  fundamental flaws in economics to manifest itself in a collapse.
Stopgap measures such as quantitative easing and zero to negative interest rates bought some time and offered some relief, but might very well be lay at the base of the next crisis.
Companies and consumers are becoming addicted to low interest rates to a point that raising them will cause stress in the financial system. For instance, pension funds in a desperate attempt to get some returns on capital are selling mortgages. If rates go up and defaults inevitably rise, pensions will be taking another painful hit.

@_date: 2016-09-05 05:20:24
Block frequency does not affect safety. For instance, if Bitcoin would have double the block frequency, just wait for 12 instead of 6 confirmations to get the same level of security.
However faster blocks allows for a more quick first confirmation and in general a more granular way of deciding when a transaction is safe enough.
In that sense, faster block frequency would be a big boost to the usability of Bitcoin, especially the ability to get a first confirmation faster.

Using a blockchain as a data store is utterly stupid. It's inefficient and offers no benefits at all over a traditional database. None whatsoever. Anything can be done using traditional databases.
Blockchains outside of Bitcoin are *not* immutable at all. Bitcoin is immutable thanks only to clever monetary incentives. Without these incentives, a blockchain will be vulnerable to 51% attacks that have the capability to rewrite transaction history.
Rather, I'd expect solar and wind energy producers to turn to mine Bitcoin as soon as energy prices fall below a certain treshold. Bitcoin mining would be done with excess energy that can otherwise only be sold at a price that is so low that mining is the more profitable option. Now that would transform the energy business, I believe Andreas Antonopoulos called it the Bitcoin Battery.

The *real* problem however is that it can happen at any time to any exchange. Bitfinex had a BTC 120,000 incentive to pretend being hacked. Other large exchanges will have similarly large or even larger incentives. So why does anyone believe *their* money at some other exchange won't get stolen sooner or later? Getting away with USD tens-of-millions might be a little bit too much dough for any exchange operator to pass up.


Here I have to disagree. Improvements in the Bitcoin protocol are sorely needed in order to enable exchanges to proof that the Bitcoin of their traders can't be stolen in hours time in a single event.
@_date: 2016-09-20 23:48:52
The Bitfinex hack where 120,000 BTC were stolen must have been the last straw for many traders. For the so maniest time this USD 70 million theft demonstrated that their money can be gone from one minute to the next. Trading has become Russian roulette.
Bitcoin urgently requires improvements that stop exchange hacks like these from being possible.
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:17:25
There is no way a trader can know whether an exchange has sound security in place.
The problem is that currently it is not possible to independently verify that the funds of traders have been stored securely. 
Any exchange can be hacked or claim to be hacked and take away BTC of its traders. It is an unacceptable risk associated with trading - I admire the courage of people who still trade.
In my opinion the Bitcoin protocol is in urgent need of enhancements that allow exchanges to securely store their Bitcoin and in a way that is visible on the blockchain. New address types and transactions should urgently be devised to enable this and end the wild-west.

Huh? It seems to me that it is not possible to issue an asset representing a dollar, a gold bar, a cup of coffee, or anything else that has a value not denominated in BTC.
There is a 1:1 peg between the value of BTC and L-BTC, so not sure what the point of assets is, but perhaps I am missing something.
What can probably be done is issue tokens with combined  tokens such as a L-BTCLTC, by doing an atomic, concerted peg-in and peg-out of BTC and LTC on both blockchains.
Liquid is great, but assets I don’t get.

That's not proof of secure storage as the Bitfinex hack demonstrated.
Proof of secure storage would be storing funds such that the funds can't all be spent at once and to any random address. Restrictions should be imposed to make it harder if not impossible to steal the funds, and those restrictions should be visible.
One way I was wondering may make funds a lot harder to steal is to require that a special output can only be spent after solving a puzzle which requires USD 100,000 worth of hashing power (or a lot of luck), reducing the attack surface tremendously.
For instance, to spend an output, not only must the keys be supplied, but also a SHA256 x 2 hash of for instance the previous block hash, with a difficulty being a fraction of the networks difficulty, and such that finding a solution requires let's say USD 100,000 worth of mining equipment.
To enhance security even further, make it so that a solution is required two blocks in a row, to thwart a hacker with little equipment but a lot of luck.
Another way may be to invent restrictions on outputs such that spending them requires a real world event from occurring, for instance an explicit notification of the exchange directed to the miners that it intends to spend USD tens-of-millions in hours time.
your comments would be appreciated.

Instantaneous near-free (sub-penny) conversion of Bitcoin into fiat and vice verse would make Bitcoin feasible for even gas stations.
Is it possible? If my understanding of Blockstreams’ Liquid is correct, then in the future this technology enables such near-free conversions. The gas station would receive the payment in Liquid-BTC and convert it to Liquid-USD which should be convertable into real USD at any time for a low one-time transaction fee.
Conversions between assets on Liquid should be fast and cheap. Settling Liquid assets into BTC or USD may be more expensive but a gas station may be fine with doing that once a day or even once a week.

BTC1 is not an alternative to Bitcoin. After the split, BTC1 will be its own cryptocurrency with its own blockchain that cannot interoperate with Bitcoin and vice verse. Bitcoin and  BTC1 nodes will therefore start to ban each other after the split. This is hazardous to both BTC1 and Bitcoin. Therefore, starting 0.15 Bitcoin nodes will drop connections with soon-to-be incompatible BTC1 nodes.
This is also done to protect nodes against suddenly being connected with many incompatible BTC1 nodes after the split. This is even more true for BTC1 because these nodes would almost certainly find themselves largely connected to Bitcoin nodes because there are much more Bitcoin nodes than BTC1 nodes in the network.
It will be healthier for both the BTC1 as well as the Bitcoin network to disconnect from each other before the split.

No, it is not. It is dead easy to copy the source code, make some changes that are trivial to implement and fire up a new altcoin.
What usually happens is that progress then stalls and the altcoin will not be able to keep up with the changes in Bitcoin. That's because these altcoins are opportunistic initiatives (Bcash) or one-off attacks on Bitcoin (segwit2x) with hardly any developers interested in joining.
Development on segwit2x has been effectively stalled for months now while Bitcoin continues to improve at a high pace. That's unsurprising given the many contributors to the Bitcoin project.
An altcoin without a proper development team is not a serious competitor. It can survive for a while but will inevitably wilt away due to lack of active development and failure to address any real world need.

The image that you linked looks pretty scary.
Payments on US debts are low due to artificial near-zero interest rates.
Back of the envelope calculations:
US debt: 21T
Interest on debt: 286B
Avg interest rate: 1.36% currently.
At an not too outlandish interest rate of 4.8% the interest on the debt would balloon to 1T, which would make debt payments the largest budget item except for Medicare.
Low interest rates are setting the stage for the next crisis as debts are ballooning and become at risk to even small rate increases. Someone paying 1.5% on a mortgage sees their interest payments double at a still modest rate of 3%. Similarly refinancing company and state debts will become a little problematic.
Not sure how you can argue that current debts are sustainable. Interest rates will inevitably start to rise once the US dollar loses its trust. That may take some time, but current fiscal policy is doing a good job of eroding that trust.

Quoting an interesting insight by "Most interesting for myself is that there is now a paradoxical situation for any potential bad faith actors to use tactics like spam to push a big blocker narrative. Spamming the network now would increase the pressure on larger providers to increase their efficiency via existing mechanisms like segwit. If they bow to user pressure and do so, they only further increase the cost of acting badly; If they don't, they risk losing users to cheaper and better services. This may be one of the reasons behind the current drop in spam-a-like transaction bursts, as you pointed out."

Lol. You'll be in for a surprise. Unless the segwit2x token attains a value close to that of BTC it won't be able to get 95% of the hashpower behind it.
Miners will have to divvy up hashpower proportional to token value or else they will be bankrupt quickly.
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:54:56


Yep, and the one and only Bitcoin blockchain consists of *valid* blocks. Miners cook up blocks according to the recipe of the blockchain they intend to extend. Bitcoin nodes validate each new block and decide which ones are constructed correctly and thus valid according to the rules that the node enforces.
Bitcoin nodes will discard any invalid blocks and the hashpower used to create such invalid block does not exist from the perspective of Bitcoin.
What this means is that the hashpower to construct blocks for the segwit2x altcoin is not even seen by Bitcoin because these blocks are invalid to Bitcoin nodes and thus not counted towards its cumulative amount of Proof of Work.
The *chain* consisting of valid blocks having the most cumulative Proof of Work therefore is indeed what defines Bitcoin.

No it is not. A segwit2x node accepts blocks that are double the size of Bitcoin blocks. A Bitcoin node will reject such large blocks.
The consensus rules are thus incompatible and so effectively segwit2x is an alternate cryptocurrency. An altcoin.
Miners representing 95% of all mining hashpower currently indicate that they intend to retract their hashpower from Bitcoin and hash segwit2x instead. This however is gratuitous support as nothing stops miners from continuing to mine Bitcoin after the creation of the segwit2x altcoin.
And that is exactly what miners will be doing if the value of Bitcoin remains high and segwit2x-coin has only a small fraction of the value of a BTC. Miners will be forced to divide their hash power roughly proportionally to the value of each token or else go bankrupt. So if segwit2x-coin has 10% of the value of a BTC, then 10% of all hashpower will be allocated to to segwit2x and 90% to BTC if miners act economically rational.

On the contrary. This is actually a situation where your node is very powerful.
If miners were to abandon Bitcoin and mine an altcoin then from the perspective of Bitcoin nodes the mining hashpower no longer exists. The blocks they create will be ignored by your node. Genuine Bitcoin blocks would be produced very slowly. However, the Bitcoin network would still function as normal otherwise.
Thanks to your Bitcoin node you can keep transacting Bitcoin. Your node defines the consensus rules of Bitcoin. It allows you to transact with anyone that runs the same node software and thus enforces the same consensus rules as your node does. No one can force you to start following some alternate consensus rules. As long as you keep running the Bitcoin software as created by the Bitcoin Core developers and which is currently published on the bitcoin.org (*not* .com) website, you are on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Don't worry about miners abandoning Bitcoin. This would be economically disastrous for miners. Mining Bitcoin is very capital intensive and mining some altcoin that has only a small fraction of the value of Bitcoin will quickly bankrupt miners. They wouldn't be able to cover their costs when mining a coin that is worth much less than Bitcoin.

Coinbase is a third party wallet. If they go down, then your bitcoin will be lost. Third parties holding bitcoin for their users such as exchanges and also Coinbase  often freeze funds, go offline, get hacked, run away with your money etc. without warning. Therefore, keeping your bitcoin in your own wallet is much, much preferred.
Recommendation is to use a wallet such as Greenaddress on a non-rooted (jailbroken) smartphone. Even more safe is to use a hardware wallet such as Trezor. Always make backups of your seed and store it in a physically seperate location from your hardware wallet to avoid losing both your wallet and your backup in a fire.
Not recommended: using a wallet on a PC. That is not safe as PCs are too vulnerable and get hacked.
Additional bonus of not using Coinbase: you will automatically own all coin of any altcoins that forks off of Bitcoin but keeps the entire history (i.e., blockchain) up until the split (such as BCH did and segwit2x intends to do).
Since these coins share the same past as Bitcoin, any bitcoin you had will be copied and spring into existence as BCH or segwit2x-coin. Make sure to sell these coins off as they will depreciate steadily. See for instance what is happening now to the value of BCH.

Things are starting to look pretty bleak for B2X.
One of their brilliant ideas was their masterplan to kill off Bitcoin by making sure all hashpower was being removed so that no new blocks would be produced and people would be forced to surrender and switch to their altcoin.
Many posts were actively trying to intimidate redditors by claiming that the Bitcoin chain would die as a result of 95% of miners switching to mine B2X.
These unsavory and hostile intimidation tactics showed their true colors. Apparently there were some people in their camp that were convinced that bullying Bitcoin users into switching to B2X would be a proper working alternative to consensual changes.
This conviction is both sad and laughable. To believe that bullying tactics would create any sustainable support is insane.
But the insanity doesn't stop there. Miners mine for a profit. They have huge bills to pay and mining an altcoin with less than half the value of Bitcoin will bankrupt them quickly. So it is not really a surprise to see that miners are starting to defect. Bitfinex shows that the market values B2X at only 20% of BTC. Given the lack of community support for B2X this is also hardly any surprise except perhaps for NYA signatories living in their reality distortion field.
They are digging themselves further into a deep hole but let's hope they see themselves forced to call off this irresponsible madness that will dupe many unsuspecting Bitcoiners out of their money.

Any profits gained by DCG or NYA signatories from them willingly and knowingly falsely promoting the bogus S2X token as "Bitcoin" will be fraudulent. DCG and NYA are liable for any damages incurred by anyone caused by tricking users into believing that their token is Bitcoin.

Does cash have a real purpose? The answer to that also applies to Bitcoin. Plus that Bitcoin is cash that can be given directly from you to someone else electronically, so across any distance. This is why it is *peer-to-peer*.
The significance of Bitcoin being peer-to-peer is so major that it is in the very title of the [whitepaper]( "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
So the actual question is: what is the purpose of peer-to-peer cash? The answer is: privacy and removal of trust.
There's a couple of things worth noticing about cash:
* Cash can be held without anyone knowing about it;
* No one can stop you from accessing your cash - unlike a bank account which can be blocked or frozen;
* A cash transaction cannot be prevented by a government or bank;
* Both payer and payee of a cash transaction witness that the payment occurred (a signed receipt can be issued as future way of proving this);
* The payer and the payee of a cash transaction do not require any information about eachother. Even names are not required. This means there is privacy.
However for two parties to be able to transact in cash they must be physically meet.
Bitcoin can do everything that cash can, but over a communication channel. That means that the requirement to physically meet no longer exists.
That's a huge breakthrough that takes transacting cash global.
Bitcoin removes another aspect of trust which is the trust in a government to have sustainable fiscal policies and bearable rates of inflation. However, there have been countless breaches of this trust - hundreds of fiat currencies have become worthless because of inflation.
Bitcoin is capped at 21 million BTC, ensuring that the value of a BTC cannot be inflated away.

The ability to pay by credit card is a service offered by the merchant. The merchant is forced to sell this service to all customers along with the actual purchase. I have long wondered how this can be legal.
Customers ought to have a choice: pay by credit card and 3-4% on top of the purchase price for the privilege, or pay by cash or debit card for free.
Credit card companies are basically handing out gifts paid by customers not using credit cards and merchants suffering lower profit margins.
Glad this is being contested and yes, this comes at a great time for Bitcoin.

That's not true. If fees go up, people will transact using traditional alternatives or wait until fees go down. In other words: fees go up, demand goes down - the definition of being elastic.


That would be true if Bitcoin were the only way to transact. So ofcourse this is nonsense too.

It won't be much better than fiat if it can just be replaced by the next cryptocurrency and go to zero.

Consider how telephony started. In the beginning, hardly anyone owned a phone so buying one made little sense because there was hardly anyone to call.

Not really. Most cryptocurrencies are straight copies of Bitcoin with some trivial to implement adaptions such as shorter times between blocks, a higher coin cap, a different coin issuing schedule etc.
The developers of Bitcoin are the most numerous, most experienced and with quite a few PhD contributing also the most scientific of all cryptocurrency development teams. Nearly all advances in the cryptocurrency space are invented by the Bitcoin developers.
Bitcoin takes a conservative approach and does not compromise on decentralization just to gain some features that seem nice in the short term but may jeopardize the project in the long run. Refusing to recklessly double the block size is an example of the healthy conservative approach of the Bitcoin developers.
Unlike the noise of shills, sock puppets and misinformed people may lead you to believe, this is highly valued. This is proven by the ongoing adoption of Bitcoin and the fact that it reigns supreme as the most supported and valuable cryptocurrency in existence.

* However, the devs can be obsoleted if r/btc were able to develop a superior cryptocurrency but instead they screw up with a flawed EDA algorithm. That's incompetence.
* Using inflammatory language like "fire the devs" - the same devs that created wealth for many early adopters and are continuing to write history with Bitcoin is beyond rude.

That's very surprising given the low numbers of transactions on that chain. Yet the request for BCH trumps that of for instance segwit transactions, Ethereum, Monero or Litecoin support?

Segwit2x is a hostile attack purely designed to disrupt Bitcoin. Segwit2x claims to be Bitcoin when in reality it is just another altcoin.
Miners and a couple companies privately met in New-York in May, invited by Barry Silbert of the DCG (Digital Currency Group). They signed an agreement (NYA) where miners representing 95% of the mining hash power vowed to retract hash power from Bitcoin with the intention to slow down transaction processing enough that it makes Bitcoin unusable such that people would feel forced to switch to segwit2x.
Jeff Garzik is the lead developer for btc1-segwit2x. He is also the cofounder of Bloq, a company that [specializes in coin tracking technology]( which aims to find the identities behind Bitcoin users.
The NYA signers then went on with a propaganda campaign on social media and spread the misinformation that the blockchain having the most cumulative hashpower is Bitcoin by definition, and they would all refer to the same section of the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( that is supposed to support this. In reality the whitepaper does not support this ridiculous "most hashpower wins" view and in fact mentions the very attack planned by segwit2x in section 8, second paragraph.
Further evidence that segwit2x is an attack is the lack of replay protection which recklessly puts funds at risk of anyone transacting and the odd response of Jeff Garzik after Core announced that 0.15 will be dropping connections with consensus-incompatible segwit2x nodes in order to preserve long-standing connections with compatible nodes. Jeff Garzik strongly disapproved this change which is incomprehensible unless his intention is to disrupt.
It is no surprise that segwit2x hardly has any support amongst users and businesses. Bitcoin developers rejected it outright. Segwit2x is nothing less than a shameless attack on Bitcoin.

No. Imagine a company that has a business model around a service that depends on abusing the blockchain as a longterm, immutable distributed storage of their customers’ data.
Such company would drive up the price of legitimate Bitcoin transactions (being those having transacting value as the sole purpose).
Such abuse of scarce on-chain space for the profit of a single company and to the detriment of legitimate Bitcoin users is unwelcome and can be considered spam.
Then, there is miners stuffing transactions into blocks to game wallet fee estimating algorithms and drive up fees, or to create a “blocks are full” narrative. Although they include a fee for their spam, they recoup these fees themselves because a miner receives all the transaction fees inside a block.

Indeed, this is standard in higher management of many big non-tech companies.
A single top developer has an output equivalent to 50 mediocre ones. Unfortunately these top ones are scarce and most developers I encountered _are_ unimaginative coders that cannot abstract even the most simple problems. I can understand why managements looks at them with disdain.
The huge demand for IT staff and the absence of talent is mostly due to that. Any idiot can be hired as a coder and earn more than a well-qualified professional in other fields.
At the same time, real talent is not well recognized within companies so they quit their dayjob, start their own tech company and occasionally become a billionaire.

Most users are not on Reddit and have no idea about the B2X drama, let alone that they know that they should be setting up and connect to their own node.
Even if they knew, most users are likely not aware that it is not possible to set up a fully validating node quickly because it can take days and even weeks to download the blockchain.
This is problematic because the flip flopping of bread is likely to occur in the first hours or days after the B2X hardfork.
I have pinged and twice asking if they were willing to clarify why they do not implement code which prevents Bread from silently flip flopping. This is not difficult to implement and required to avoid users losing funds. They haven't clarfied this.
The fork nears and as it stands it is dangerous to use Bread after the hardfork. I recommend to look for alternatives such as SamuraiWallet or GreenAddress.

Money was always intended as a store of value. The value of government issued fiat was initially linked to gold. Now, the value of a fiat currency is fully dependent on the trustworthiness and fiscal discipline of its issuing government. So the way the world works changed. Wat hasn't changed is that [on average, a fiat money becomes worthless in 27 years](


Didn't say that. If there is no stable means to store the fruits of ones labour, there will be no economy left. For a healthy economy it is imperative that a stable store of value exists.


Jury is still out on that one. So far, Bitcoin has experienced monetary *inflation* and will for the coming years. The instability comes from spikes due to waves of adoption and down periods due to diminishing trust and scepticism.

No, that’s completely bogus. The whitepaper documents the _exact attack_ on SPV nodes that is planned in November where miners creating invalid blocks overpower honest miners.
Please read section 8 titled “Simplified Payment Verification” (SPV), second paragraph. It speaks for itself:
“As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.” -Satoshi.

Since you are being so active in this thread, perhaps you can offer some insight in what exactly you mean to say.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:19:02


Sure. Quoting u/etherael:
“This does nothing to justify the 1mb block size decision blocking”
With segwit we have a practical limit of 2 MB now. This is easily observable. There have been countless blocks bigger than 1 MB. The Bitcoin ecosystem including developers were overwhelmingly in favor of segwit. The ones sabotaging it were miners, which are now (85% of hash power) expressing their support for the NYA and with that the B2X altcoin.
Easy to disprove lie, therefore.
 “that is the genesis of this entire debacle.”
Bitcoin is enjoying increased adoption and all time highs so it is not clear what debacle he is referring to. Perhaps he is referring to the miserable failure of BCH which has a botched difficulty adjustment algorithm, no adoption, mostly empty blocks and ever sliding value now at 17 times less than that of BTC.
“you're stalling an obvious change because it's in the financial interests of the company for which you are CTO”
Ok, this is the “Blockstream is stalling Bitcoin” narrative that nullc has disproven countless of times. Blockstream has 1.5 FTE equivalent working on Bitcoin which consists of hundreds of contributors. This is also verifiable pretty easily. Secondly, Blockstream pays its employee in fixed amounts of BTC, giving their employees a direct incentive to help BTC become more valuable. Also, nullc holds a non-significant amount of BTC himself (by his own account of which I have no reason to doubt as he is an early adopter and involved since 2011) which is further incentive to provide value for Bitcoin. And that’s just talking about presumed economic incentives, because I am willing to bet that the philosophical incentives of creating a revolutionary and world changing “good money” trumps it handily.
“and there is absolutely zero reason not to increase the block size”
There’s been countless debates about that. Bitcoin Core has enlarged the maximum block size with segwit and never ruled out further increases. Their [scalability roadmap]( written in December 2015 is clear:
“Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them.”
“an extremely controversial decision on your part”
Again plain lies. Nullc doesn’t get to decide anything, and the consensus was to _increase_ blocksize. It has not been controversial in any way shape or form.
“that just so happens to be in your financial interests,”
This is libel. No evidence provided whatsoever, just a hollow claim.
“many people will assume you made the decision purely because it is in your financial interests”
Slanderous lies. Evidence: none.
“you dug your own damned hole and it's nobody's fault but yours.”

Which doesn't make any logical sense. A lot of fud was actively being spread about how segwit was unsafe (such as the [ANYONECANSPEND fud]( but segwit is ofcourse working as intended thanks to the world class engineering of the Bitcoin Core developers. This led to the suspicion that BitMain was behind the opposition of segwit. BitMain miners use "covert AsicBoost" which is a technique that allows their rigs to use less electricity than competing mining equipment. However, segwit introduced changes to Bitcoin that made using covert AsicBoost impossible, which would explain their fierce opposition to segwit. We're talking big money here - the AsicBoost advantage is worth US$ 100 million according to estimates of experts.
After segwit was finalized, the Bitcoin software was programmed to activate segwit but not before 95% of the hashpower signalled to be ready. After all, miners are tasked with creating valid blocks and should be given the opportunity to update their software for protocol changes such as segwit. As a courtesy to the miners, the Bitcoin software basically said: "ok, segwit is here, but I'll politely hold off its activation until 95% of you say that you're ready to deal with this protocol change".
Sadly, mining is heavily centralized, and segwit was never getting activated due to the opposition of a few or perhaps even a single person: Jihan Wu of BitMain. As an aside, the centralization of hash power is also a direct result of AsicBoost. How this works: since AsicBoosted rigs are able to mine more efficiently than their competitors, these rigs drive up the difficulty and with that the average amount of hashes required to find a block. This in turn causes less efficient rigs to mine at a loss because they need to expend more energy to find a block. As a result, BitMain competitors got pushed out and BitMain became the dominant self-mining ASIC manufacturer.
After segwit was finalized, it required 95% of the hashpower to activate but it never gained more than around 30%. So 70% of hash power abused the courtesy of the Bitcoin software to wait until they were ready for activation and refused to give the go ahead. This went on for months and worst case it would have taken until August 2018 before segwit would activate.


In March 2017 a pseudonymous user called Shaolin Fry created [BIP148]( which is a softfork that invalidates any block that wouldn't signal segwit readiness starting August 1st 2017. This also became known as the UASF (User-Activated Soft Fork, as opposed to the original miner-activated soft fork that didn't work as intended). This patch saw significant adoption and miners would soon be forced to signal segwit or else see their blocks being invalidated by the network, which would cause them significant financial losses.
In May 2017 so *after* BIP148, the backroom New-York Agreement (NYA) was created by the Digital Currency Group of Barry Silbert together with businesses in the Bitcoin space such as BitPay and almost all miners. The NYA was the beginning of an outright misinformation campaign.
The NYA was trumpeted to be a "compromise". Miners would finally agree to activate segwit. In return, Bitcoin would hardfork and double its capacity on top of the doubling already achieved by segwit. In reality, BIP148 was already going to force miners to signal the activation of segwit. Also, developers and most users were notably absent in this NYA. So, given that segwit was already unstoppable because of BIP148, the parties around the table had to "compromise" to do something that they all wanted: hardfork Bitcoin to increase its capacity.

No. Bcash or BCH is a previous clone of Bitcoin. It featured two-way replay protection so it was not as dangerous. Although pitched as a high-capacity alternative to Bitcoin, BCH is only worth 0.078 BTC down from an initial 0.2 BTC. Its has a flawed difficulty adjustment algorithm and centralized mining which causes it to regularly stop transacting for 12 hours straight. Its blocks are on average filled at 5% of total capacity. Safe to say, Bcash has failed. There is no market for this altcoin.

Unfortunately, this is reality.
It is up to a business to abandon the Bitcoin space and bet the farm on an altcoin.
Sadly the DCG not only works on their 2xc altcoin but also intend to attack Bitcoin in the process by [creating malware]( that is damaging to Bitcoin nodes and the Bitcoin network as a whole.
Also sadly, Barry Silberts' DCG and supporting businesses such as BitPay and Coinbase fraudulently claim that their altcoin is an [upgrade of Bitcoin]( and this false claim can be used to defraud unsuspecting users.
For instance, Coinbase stores their users' Bitcoin but considers 2xc to be the equivalent. Taking this to its logical conclusion, this means Coinbase considers it perfectly legal to return 2xc instead of Bitcoin to users. This is like depositing your gold with a custodian but finding they think it is fine to return lead if you come to recollect your gold.

Likely there is a big correlation between price and volatility. As volatility goes down, the number of use cases shoot up. Once volatility is at levels comparable to that of big fiat currencies, things are about to get _really_ interesting.

The S2X fork creates a copy of the entire blockchain. What this means is that the complete transaction history is copied as well as all keys. In practice this will mean that your bitcoin are being cloned. Your original bitcoin are unaffected but you will automatically have S2X coin on the clone chain as well.
To access them however might be tricky. Wait for instructions from your hardware wallet vendor. Also, it is better not to transact around the time of the hardfork to avoid your coins of being moved on both chains. This can rob you from your cloned coins.
This works as follows. Since S2X blockchain is a clone of Bitcoin, transactions that work on the Bitcoin blockchain also function on the cloned chain unless precautions are taken. Suppose that after the hardfork in November I ask you to pay me 1 BTC. You create a transaction and broadcast it out to the Bitcoin network. First, the transaction lands inside a block, then, a couple more blocks are mined which makes the transaction irreversible and I have received your 1 BTC as intended.
But since the S2X chain is a clone it will also process your transaction just fine. So I maliciously also broadcast the *exact same* transaction on the S2X chain and by doing this I send 1 S2X-coin to myself in addition to your 1 BTC I had already received. Now I have cheated you out of 1 S2X coin. This is called a replay attack.
There are ways to protect yourself from this replay attack. They will likely involve introducing differences between the two chains such that transactions only work on a single blockchain. For instance, if you buy some BTC after the split, then you won't receive the corresponding S2X-coin. Next, you create a transaction that sends both your newly bought and your original bitcoin to a new address. This transaction cannot be replayed on the S2X chain because the newly bought bitcoin don't exist there, and the transaction will be invalid. At this point you have successfully split your coins and you will be able to transact on both chains without fear of your transactions being replayed.

The model that B2X adopts means miners unilaterally decide over its consensus rules. Users don’t have any influence except for the ability to vote with their feet and sell. I expect this to happen just like it did for Bcash and the futures market agrees.


Then you also understand that if B2X will be less valuable than BTC, it will also have less hash power and will quickly lose the (meaningless) “most total hashpower” badge.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:59:54


Oh man... Quoting _the very first sentence_ of section 8, titled “Simplified Payment Verification”:
“It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.”


No, really, it is not. In the B2X model, users accept the chain with the most total hashpower. This means that miners dictate consensus rules. Users will have to trust miners not to do anything that devalues their token in a way that net benefits miners.


That’s not what decentralized means. Decentralized means that there does _not_ exist any point in the system that can be controlled such that the behavior of the system can be altered without consent of its users. In the case of B2X, the point of control is one or two people in China that control the majority of all hash power and therefore control the consensus rules of the system according to the B2X modus operandi being “most hashpower wins”.


Sure, but that’s consensus as dictated by miners, whom users will have to trust not to do abuse their powers and do anything nefarious.


In general yes but not in the B2X model which demands users follow hashpower.


The takeaway is ofcourse that miners let their own interests prevail over the interests of users and do not hesitate to act nefariously from a users perspective if they can make more money themselves.


Yes, in case of Bitcoin. But in case of B2X, hashpower becomes _leading_. I thought we had agreed on that as well?


I don’t see how you can possibly maintain this in a B2X world where it’s the miners that dictate the consensus rules.

 I don’t understand how you can say this. I can point out sections straight from the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( that directly contradicts this, such as section 8, second paragraph.
It doesn’t make any sense either. Why would users adopt a system that they have no control over, is centralized, not trustless and as such offers no advantage over fiat, VISA or PayPal?
I hope I don’t have to point out that mining is highly centralized and putting a lot of power in the hands of miners [will not end well](


Are you equating the very few people in China that control the vast majority of all hashpower with “the community”?

Indeed and this why the "most hashpower wins" is completely bogus. This misinterpretation of the Bitcoin whitepaper will result in a contraption that has _nothing_ to do with Bitcoin.
You raise exactly the right questions.
Want to get rich quick? Do the following:
1. Become a Xapo customer.
2. Wait for the hardfork.
3. Immediately after the fork, make sure whether miners switched and B2X now has the "most accumulated difficulty".
4. buy $many B2X for 1/4 the price of BTC.
5. Wait a few days.
6. Notice miners returning to mine on the BTC chain.
7. Wait until BTC has regained the "most accumulated hash power".
8. Withdraw BTC. According to the position of Xapo just outlined in their blogpost, you should be receiving BTC, not B2X.
9. Profit!

Again Bitcoin is narrowly defined by its whitepaper which as short as it is documents the exact attack planned to start at block 494,784 where a majority of hash power overpowers the network.


“Consensus” doesn’t mean some majority agrees. It means _everyone_ agrees. There is nothing to measure, we can easily observe that the NYA is highly contentious anf most people holding BTC oppose it.
I’ll do a prediction for you. Either of the following will happen:
* No hardfork. NYA falls apart due to defecting miners and NYA is history.
* No hardfork at 494,784 but announcement that there will be a delay and blaming it on bugs introduced by Bitcoin Core.
* Hardfork at fork point block. Miners switch to B2X to make it the chain with the most total hashpower. Bitcoin Core responds with countermeasures to contain the impact of this attack. As the value of the B2X token slides, miners start losing increasingly big amounts of money. At some point miners switch back to mine BTC to avoid bankrupting themselves. 
There are only losers in any scenario except perhaps for the fact that Bitcoin comes out stronger, which is actually a great thing.
Your persistence in refusing to acknowledge how Bitcoin actually works makes me think you have a big stake in the success of B2X which blinds you to the facts.

The developers were all behind segwit which quickly reached consensus once Luke-Jr showed that it could be done with a softfork. The community wasn’t split - on the contrary. Segwit was received very favorably which is unsurprising given that it offered great improvements in several important areas at hardly any cost to decentralization.
Every attempt to divide the community over the block size issue has failed miserably. The community is well aware that decentralization is key to being trustless. That’s what lends Bitcoin its value: being trustless, decentralized and thus truly equivalent to “peer-to-peer”. No third party involved in the value transfer, no censorship, no blacklisting, no freezing of accounts, no random confiscations. These are the key values of Bitcoin.
We all understand that very well, and it’s big part of why we’re here.

Ask yourself if there was really a split, or if it were all largely manufactured drama.
Litecoin always had 4 x capacity compared to Bitcoin. That’s the capacity a block size doubling + segwit would bring to Bitcoin. It would have been a great alternative for more capacity when fees rose and blocks became full. But Litecoin never really became a credible competitor to Bitcoin. It has always traded at a fraction of the price of Bitcoin. The transaction capacity issues were not severe enough for most people to start considering Litecoin.
Same for BCH. Its ever sliding price is again a fraction of that of Bitcoin. Its community is tiny compared that of Bitcoin. It has no credible development team because it fails to attract the talent and academia that Bitcoin enjoys. It’s a dud.

But they (miners) _do_ in the B2X model. Miners unilaterally set the consensus rules that define B2X. They do that by mining on top of a block that they themselves select, and so this block extends the chain having most total hash power and the block becomes part of it. In the B2X model, nodes have no power to reject that block. Miners can put whatever they please in their blocks.


If users have B2X tokens then they are at the mercy of miners. Yes, they can sell  but as long as they have value they need to trust miners that they will be able to transact for reasonable fees. But nothing stops miners from setting a 5% transaction fee.


They do within the B2X model. Yes, users can likely and hopefully sell their coin and stop following the B2X consensus rules.

I hope bread is willing to clarify why they believe that their way of handling the fork serves their users best given that a transacting user cannot be sure on which chain they are transacting and given that there are ways to avoid any ambiguity that don't seem very difficult to implement.
As it stands, users must be made aware of the acute risk of losing funds when they use bread in the days after the fork. The scenario where bread flip flops between chains is very real. It is likely that a majority of the hash power switches to B2X and gives it most total hash power directly after the fork. Since we know that B2X coin will not have enough value to finance 80% of the worlds' mining power, it is inevitable that many miners will be switching back to mining Bitcoin. At some point Bitcoin will again become the longest chain.
If bread intends to flip flop between chains based on most total hash power then it is dysfunctional and users should be made aware of this.
Time is running out.

This definition would mean that any block is valid as long as it is mined on top of the previous block. After all, a new block by definition will have the most accumulated hash power.
By the absurd NYA definition of “Bitcoin”, invalid blocks don’t exist because any new block at the tip of the chain will have the most total hash power.

* B2X intends to hardfork at [block 494,784](
* Presumably, activation is by a block that has a block weight above 4M which is an invalid Bitcoin block.
* This is however underspecified. The announcement linked above reads: "a block between 1MB and 2MB in size will be generated" but such block would still be valid as a Bitcoin block as long as its weight is below 4M.
* Definite specification of how the hardfork will be triggered ought to be found within the ["segwit2X Release guide]( Sadly the section "Phase 2 - 2M base block size hard fork (2M HF)" is empty and "coming soon".
* Therefore, Bread may want to work with the assumption that the difference in consensus rules between Bitcoin and B2X is limited to B2X allowing a 8M block weight as opposed to the maximum 4M block weight of Bitcoin.
* Any block at 494,784 or higher that has a block weight of over 4M marks the start of the split. Since the spec isn't clear whether this will be block 494,784 or a later block, let's hence just refer to this block as the FatBlock because it is overweight. The FatBlock height is the first block height having a valid block on both chains. So if 494,800 is the first block with a weight over 4M, then this block will be rejected by the Bitcoin consensus rules but accepted by the B2X consensus rules. Block 494,800 will be the first block height that has both a Bitcoin version (&lt;= 4M) and a B2X version (&gt; 4M).
Of the about 9600 Bitcoin nodes in the network only 480 (or 5%) of them are B2X nodes. Likely SPV wallets such as Bread will be exclusively connected to Bitcoin nodes. There will be a small portion of users connected to both a Bitcoin and a B2X node. I don't think there will be any users that will be exclusively connected to B2X nodes by chance - this situation is likely only possible if the user becomes victim of a B2X sybil attack.
B2X nodes can [optionally pretend to be Bitcoin nodes]( Just looking at the user agent string is therefore not reliable in knowing to what nodes Bread is connected.
Let's therefore assume that Bread is connected to a number of nodes without being able to tell for each whether they are a Bitcoin or a B2X node.
To reiterate: the goal for Bread is to be able to tell apart the two differing blockchains: the Bitcoin blockchain (valid according to Bitcoin nodes) and the alternative B2X blockchain (valid according to btc1-B2X nodes).
To achieve this goal, Bread needs to look out for any of the following events:
* Status: Bread has not seen the FatBlock. Event: Bread gets a block that is &lt;= 4M. Interpretation: Bread is on the Bitcoin blockchain. No fork has occured. The user sees BTC only.
* Status: Bread has not seen the FatBlock. Event: Bread gets a block that is &gt;4M in weight and correctly references the previous block. The block height is &gt;= 494,784. Interpretation: This is the FatBlock. Action: create an internal representation of two chains, one for B2X and one for Bitcoin. Both have a unique block hash at the height of the FatBlock. User sees two balances: BTC (synced up to height = FatBlock - 1) and B2X (synced up to height = FatBlock).
* Status: Bread has not seen the FatBlock. Event: Bread gets a block that is &gt;4M in weight but does _not_ correctly reference the previous block. The block height is &gt;= 494,784. Interpretation: This block is an invalid Bitcoin block. It might be a B2X block but there is no way to know for sure as the previous block is not known. Bread is therefore only in sync with the Bitcoin blockchain. Action: keep the block header in case it is a B2X block in order to be able to eventually construct a valid B2X chain all the way back to the FatBlock. User sees only BTC.
* Status: Bread has seen the FatBlock. Event: Bread gets a block &lt;= 8M in weight and which correctly refers to a previous block which is a block on the same chain as the FatBlock. Interpretation: This is a B2X block. Action: The B2X chain received a new block and is now synced up to the height of the new block. User sees BTC and B2X.
* Status: Bread has seen the FatBlock. Event: Bread gets a block that is &lt;= 4M in weight and which correctly refers to a previous block which is a block on the same chain as the Bitcoin blockchain. Interpretation: this is a Bitcoin block. Action: the Bitcoin blockchain can be synced up to the height of the new block. User sees BTC and B2X.
... and so on, I think these are the major events. Takeaway is that Bread should be able to tell apart the B2X chain from the BTC chain so that it knows how to show a BTC balance and how to show a B2X balance.
The remaining problem is transacting which is trickier. If a user sends a transaction, there is no easy way to ensure that the transaction only occurs on one chain. Best is to not allow the user to transact at all until it is possible to split the coins. Alternatively, if Bread is up for it, create a way to split coins for a user for instance by creating a transaction that can only be valid on on of the chains using locktime. Don't allow the user to transact until its funds are safely split.
The above should ofcourse be reviewed by your engineers as I am reasoning from a more limited amount of knowledge than your engineers presumably have. There might have been things that I am missing on a technical level.

It doesn’t matter. Two parties transacting Bitcoin will ensure they are using the consensus rules that they consider to represent Bitcoin.

NYA signatories hold the position that B2X is a [Bitcoin Upgrade]( and that their &gt; 1 MB block at 494,784 is a _valid Bitcoin block_.
In other words, NYA signatories claim that their hardfork of Bitcoin represents “BTC” even though their block at fork point is _invalid_.
So how can they claim that their block is valid according to the _Bitcoin_ consensus rules? NYA signatories argue that their block is a valid _Bitcoin_ block, because it has the *most total hash power* behind it.
So, to be clear, according to NYA signatories, whichever chain has the most cumulative hash power is Bitcoin by their own absurd definition.
Obviously this is a bizarre model that is untenable.

Later they find out that bread displayed a B2X balance and the seller took advantage of that by defrauding them.

Core devs never ruled out larger blocks. They just want to first evaluate the effects of other planned increases.
Quoting the December 2015 ["Capacity increases for the Bitcoin system"](
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough. Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them."
Note that segwit is currently being utilized at only 10% but that transaction backlogs have largely disappeared. This shows that the capacity increase offered by segwit has been effective in eliminating episodes of full blocks and high fees.
Other capacity increases are planned such as aggregated signatures (another 20% - 30% increase). Off-chain transaction systems such as Lightning Network may obsolete the need for on-chain capacity increases altogether.

Never in a way such that old versions of Bitcoin are being forced to upgrade to avoid rejecting Bitcoin blocks as invalid.
In other words - there has never been a hard fork (where previously invalid blocks are valid after a the fork so all nodes must be upgraded for the network to remain functional), only soft forks (blocks remain valid for all existing nodes, so the network remains functional even if nodes do not upgrade).

The Digital Currency Group (DCG) is a group of businesses headed by Barry Silbert who met in New York last May. They agreed to hardfork Bitcoin, therewith abandoning the Bitcoin space and bet the farm on their new altcoin "2xc".
Sadly this DCG not only works on this 2xc altcoin but also intend to attack Bitcoin in the process by [creating malware]( that is damaging to Bitcoin nodes and the Bitcoin network as a whole.
Also sadly, Barry Silberts' DCG and supporting businesses such as BitPay and Coinbase fraudulently claim that their altcoin is an [upgrade of Bitcoin]( and this false claim can be used to defraud unsuspecting users.
For instance, Coinbase stores their users' Bitcoin but considers 2xc to be the equivalent. Taking this to its logical conclusion, this means Coinbase considers it perfectly legal to return 2xc instead of Bitcoin to users. This is like depositing your gold with a custodian but finding they think it is fine to return lead if you come to recollect your gold.

Andreas very clearly emphasizes the crucial importance of running a node towards the end of the video. He ends with saying that running your own node is equal to using Bitcoin as it was meant to be: trustless and without appeal to any authority. He also contrasts this with the role of miners which he notes are just sequencing transactions and creating blocks to the pleasure of nodes. Perhaps you didn't watch the full video?


Andreas also outlines the specs requires to run a full node. They are that of a modern PC and it uses a significant amount of its CPU and a good portion of the bandwidth of a fast DSL connection. Doubling the requirements will definitely lead to a drop in the number of people willing to make the expenses to run a node.


Because hardly anyone is interested in using Bcash. 


Bitcoin is operating in an adverse environment. There are many malicious actors that continuously try to attack Bitcoin for various reasons.
Stuffing blocks with transactions is such an attack which resulted bloating the blocksize, racking up transaction fees and inducing long waits before transactions got confirmed. It creates the false narrative that blocks were full and that the on-chain transaction capacity had to urgently be increased. Now that segwit has activated, these spam attacks have suddenly disappeared.
This demonstrates that Bitcoin is susceptible to any attack and that no means no matter how malicious are left unused if money is on the line.
Although the true capacity on-chain transactions required might not fill up 4 MB blocks, Bitcoin must face the real threat that adverse attacks are going to fill up 4 MB blocks for prolonged periods. We have just seen miners stuffing blocks to the detriment of all users.


If you attribute this effect to segwit then you are saying that segwit resolved the issue. Then why would a doubling in capacity be required?
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:47:28


Yep. And by that definition, B2X is not Bitcoin.
The "chain" in your quote refers to a chain of _valid_ blocks. The Bitcoin protocol specifies that blocks with a weight exceeding 4M are invalid. Bitcoin nodes discard them and they do not extend the chain. The hashes expended to find an invalid block are not counted and never even existed from the point of view of a Bitcoin node.
And _that_ is how Bitcoin works. The Bitcoin whitepaper is unambiguous about that.

Interesting. Some feedback:
* Addresss format of “ does not allow dots. That is a disadvantage as people will expect and want to be able to use the same username as their e-mail address. One way around this is to change the address format to domain.tld Another one is to use the same format as an e-mail address, but change the @ to ₿ as in: username₿domain.tld.
* It looks like that the protocol requires the wallet to indicate a new, updated address. This requires the wallet to be online. Alternatively, instead of an address, a seed as used by [deterministic wallets]( may be used. This way, the server can watch the blockchain and detect whether the address received a payment and subsequently calculate the next public address. No need for any wallet-server interaction.
* A user should be able to change the seed for their username and restart at the first address of the new seed. The server may request additional proof of authentication for replacing a seed, for instance by requesting the user to sign a server generated message using the private key of the original seed. This way, the CCAP server links the old and the new seed.
It is difficult to mitigate against an attack where the CCAP address database is compromised and user addresses are substituted for that of a hacker.
Perhaps it is possible for the server to provide an extra  piece of data for a username that the sender can use to cryptographically verify the age of the seed of username. A seed that has been in use for over than a week may be considered save. I am not sure how this can be done without compromising the seed, but I am confident that it can be done.
A weak spot:
The server knows all receiving addresses of a username. If the CCAP server is compromised then this results in a loss of privacy as all payments that a username received are also compromised.

_continue here_
Or, is it all in fact really about increasing capacity? After all, segwit already achieved this. Bcash was created which doubled block size as well but without segwit. And then there is good old Litecoin having four times the transaction capacity of Bitcoin _and_ segwit. Plenty of working alternatives that obsolete the need for yet another altcoin. So, perhaps transaction capacity is used as an excuse to reach a different goal. Let's explore.
Apparently after not-so-careful study of the Bitcoin whitepaper, the NYA participants came up with an absurd redefinition of what is "Bitcoin". According to this bizarre definition, they started to claim that Bitcoin is being defined as:
1. Any blockchain that has the most cumulative hashpower behind it (measured from the Genesis block at the inception of Bitcoin):
2. Using the SHA256 hashing algorithm;
3. Having the current difficulty adjustment algorithm (resetting difficulty every 2016 blocks).
Ad 1. Note that it starts with "any blockchain". This also includes blockchains that contain invalid blocks, in other words, blocks that Bitcoin nodes would reject.
This is ofcourse bizarre but it is exactly what the NYA participants claim. It effectively puts all power in the hand of miners. Instead of nodes validating blocks, according to this novel and absurd interpretation of Bitcoin it will be miners that call the shots. Whatever block a miner produces will be valid as long as they mine on top of their own block, because that chain will then have the most cumulative hash power. Nodes become mere distributors of blocks and lose all their authority as they can no longer decide over the validity of a block. MinerCoin is born.
The [Bitcoin whitepaper]( actually mentions this scenario where a majority of the hashpower takes over the network and starts producing invalid blocks and refers to it as being an _attack_. It is worth quoting this section 8, second paragraph in its entirety:
"As such, the verification is reliable **as long as honest nodes control the network**, but is more vulnerable if the network is **overpowered by an attacker**. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an **attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.** One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they **detect an invalid block**, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification." (emphasises mine).
Any doubt left whether "most hashpower wins" is an attack should be removed by a telling remark in the [release notes of 0.3.19](
"Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain."
As mentioned, miners representing 95% of all hash power participate in the NYA. They are currently expressing their support for the NYA by putting ["NYA" inside blocks]( The NYA participants intend to remove their hash power from Bitcoin completely and point it towards their altcoin. To double down on their claim that Bitcoin is defined by hashpower, they show some serious audacity by referring to their altcoin as... "Bitcoin". Anyone not part of the NYA refers to their coin as segwit2x, S2X or sometimes 2x.
The NYA participants proceed to proclaim victory. They reason that with all hash power on their blockchain and hardly any left for Bitcoin, "legacy Bitcoin" will be stuck as blocks will be created so slowly that Bitcoin becomes unusable, forcing everyone to switch to the "real" Bitcoin (_sic_). In other words, it was part of the plan was to remove hash power from Bitcoin to disrupt and force users into their altcoin.
Ofcourse, Bitcoin Core would not just sit idle and let such an attack happen. There are several ways to defend against this attack. As a last resort, an emergency difficulty reset combined with a change in the PoW algorithm can be deployed to get Bitcoin going again.
This is not likely to be necessary however as miners simply can't afford to mine a coin that has a small fraction of the value of Bitcoin. They have large bills to pay which is impossible by mining a coin that has half or even less the value of Bitcoin. In other words, miners would bankrupt themselves unless their altcoin attains the same value as Bitcoin. Given the lack of user, community and developer support it is save to say that this is not going to happen. Their coin will have only a small fraction of the value of Bitcoin and miners have no choice but to continue mine Bitcoin in order to receive the income necessary to pay for their huge operational expenses.
A moment was set for the hardfork: [block 494,784]( a big block will be produced such that it is invalid for the current Bitcoin network and will discard it.
Ofcourse, _some_ nodes must accept the new, bigger S2X blocks. Therefore, Jeff Garzik (co-founder of a company called Bloq) started out to create [btc1]( which is a fork of the Bitcoin node software and which is adapted such that it accepts blocks up to twice in size, so that the segwit2x altcoin can exist. Note the 1 in btc1 which refers to their version numbering. Bitcoin Core releases are still 0.x but btc1 is numbered 1.x. This is to send the message that they have released the real Bitcoin that is now no longer a beta 0.x release but a production ready 1.x. This nonwithstanding the fact that btc1 is a copy of Bitcoin 0.14 with some minor changes and without any significant development causing it to quickly fall behind Bitcoin.
The NYA participants go on to claim that when hash power is on the btc1 blockchain, and Bitcoin is dead as a result because no or hardly any new blocks are being created, then the Bitcoin Core developers have no choice but to start contributing to their btc1 github controlled by Jeff Garzik.
In the NYA end state, Bitcoin is a coin of which miners set the consensus rules, and the Core developers sheepishly contribute to software in a repository controlled by Jeff Garzik or whoever pays him.
Needless to say, this is never ever going to happen.


There is no such thing as small block hardliners. As is probably clear by now, NYA is not about block size. It is about control over Bitcoin. As a matter of fact, Bitcoin Core has never closed the door on a block size increase. In the [scaling roadmap]( published in December 2015, Bitcoin Core notes:
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."
Bitcoin Core literally says here very clearly that further increases of block size are on the table as an option in the future.


I hope that your personal opinion has changed after taking notes of the above.

In this thread this has just been refuted by both nullc and luke-jr.
According to them, downloading block 494,784 and verifying its size works. And according to luke-jr this can be done in just a few lines of code.
If bread does not intend to implementing any protection against silently changing blockchains then it is putting most of its users and their funds at risk.
Since luke-jr, nullc and myself show that an easy to implement fix exists, it sadly follows that failing to implementing such fix is a conscious decision that will inevitably lead to users losing funds and is therefore malfeasance.
I therefore strongly urge bread to reconsider their planned way of handling the hardfork.
In case bread does not have the technical capability to implement a way to show correct B2X and BTC user balances after the hardfork, I suggest that bread does not show any balances at all until it can.

Not sure what you mean by “privately provable”. The receivers of the paper wallet containing a t-shirt token had no way to tell if this t-shirt actually existed, and also had no way of enforcing ownership.

No. S2X is an altcoin because it has alternate consensus rules.
Bitcoin nodes reject blocks with weight over 4,000,000, whereas S2X accepts blocks with weight up to 8,000,000.
This consensus rule change is being introduced without consensus of the Bitcoin community which indisputably renders S2X an altcoin.

My point is that there your crowing about how you can beat risk-free interest rate without risk is misguided. There _was_ a risk, and banks _did_ default, but you don’t perceive your actions as risky because the bail-outs were paid for with your tax money. But in the end, that’s your and everyone’s money which pays for the billions that vanished into thin air.
This is one of the reasons Bitcoin exists. The message in the Genesis block being “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” makes an explicit reference to the corrupted practice of using tax money to bail out banks.
In my opinion, you should have lost all your money for doing business with weak banks, instead of being subsidized by the tax payer.

Yes, I think we agree here as well, actually. We just don’t agree to the order of cause and effect. You seem to believe that the value of a token follows the amount of hashpower mining it. I believe the amount of hashpower follows the value of the token.
This has already been demonstrated to be the case by Bcash, which received BTC levels of mining power at the start but never reached a value anywhere close to that of BTC.
You’ll soon have this demonstrated to you again, if at least there’s any NYA signatories left by the time the fork is planned to occur.

To be able to extend the chain a block must be valid. A block is valid only if it satisfies the consensus rules that a Bitcoin node is programmed to validate.
If a block does not satisfy the consensus then it will be discarded and not become part of the Bitcoin blockchain. Any hash power expended to find an invalid block is considered non-existant.
Therefore it is correct to say that the longest chain represents Bitcoin as it can only be referring to a chain of *valid* blocks.

We have recently seen many episodes where blocks were stuffed with spam transactions harming the entire network by driving up fees, inducing long waits before transactions got confirmed and bloating the blockchain with gigabytes of cruft.
Rising the cap gives miners a powerful weapon and makes spam attacks much more harmful and potentially dangerous for the continuity of Bitcoin. Miners have shown not to operate in the interest of the network. See also [this tweet]( by Jihan Wu of BitMain.

No, the longest *valid* chain is Bitcoin. 
The segwit2x blockchain will not be valid after having produced its big block in November. This block won't follow the consensus rules of Bitcoin because it is too large and Bitcoin nodes will discard it as well as any blocks mined on top of it.
The amount of hashpower that the invalid segwit2x chain will receive is irrelevant to Bitcoin.

[Good money drives our bad]( ... Gresham's law allows for some pretty brutal outcomes if Bitcoin turns out to be a good money relative to fiat in general and the US dollar in particular.
If governments and central banks become convinced that Bitcoin cannot be stopped and has indeed the potential to drive out fiat then they will see themselves forced to create a Bitcoin reserve.

Indeed, I saw that as well. This can be explained by someone selling a large amount BTC and buy BCH and ETH.
With segwit2x looming in November, one can expect BCH holders to sell and buy BTC so to take maximum advantage of the fork. Therefore BCH can be expected to continue to slide until the hardfork.
So those who exchanged their BTC for BCH are likely going to lose money on that trade.

Proper economic incentives. Every four years the block reward halves. It started out at 50 BTC per block, then it halved to 25 BTC and now it stands at 12.5 BTC. In about three years it will halve again to 6.25 BTC.
This means that the fees become an increasingly bigger portion of the income of a miner. Forfeiting fees becomes more expensive going forward.
Since miners need the block reward and fees to pay for their electricity, equipment and rent, they cannot afford to forfeit the fees if they become a significant part of their income. So in the long term, economizing miners aren’t expected to spam.

Looking at GitHub stats is a very poor way of determining the amount of work someone put in. For example, Gavin Andresen has spent considerable time to [test the feasibility of larger block sizes]( This is not reflected in the GitHub stats, even though the testing is crucial. If money was the only incentive for Gavin, he might as well forego this time consuming testing, and just get the change straight into Bitcoin and do a "smoke test". Any changes due to bugs would result in more GitHub changes and more money. In general, developers that leave bugs and need to change their code often are rewarded in your scheme.
More in general, I think this scheme is unfair for core developers that devote large parts of their time to Bitcoin. Not just with GitHub commits, but also in various other ways.
An improvement would be to indiscriminately reward any core developer evenly, and try to come up with the criteria as to what makes someone a core developer.

Cryptocurrencies have real utility which justifies their existence. Bitcoin enables trustless, private, cheap and fast value transfers over communication lines - something that is otherwise impossible. There will always be demand for that. Bitcoin enables to store value by simply writing down twelve random words on a piece of paper, and is designed such that its value cannot be manipulated by arbitrarily increased inflation such as happens with all fiat currencies. This is a new paradigm in money and might prove to be its most valuable property in the long run.
The current episode in the short history of Bitcoin where it stays low after the latest bubble is interesting and without a doubt disappointing to many, some of who are probably now busy trolling this forum. But perhaps it is sane to take a step back and look at the reasons of why Bitcoin exists, recognize that Bitcoin enables otherwise impossible feats and notice the slow but steady development on Bitcoin Core as well as its ecosystem, and realize that the price of the day is not all that significant.

Yes and to add on: Bitcoin is a new type of asset. It’s not like institutional traders can just starting trading away.
My guess is that most institutions, some form of product approval will first be required before a trader is mandated to trade Bakkt. For that, the product requires modeling and stress testing to see how it potentially affects the overall position. Then, adding Bakkt to a portfolio will impact risk management and trade booking and processing related systems, which means IT related changes. Reporting regulations likely cause additional impact. For prudent institutions, I guesstimate that it may take 3 to 6 months before they obtain the capability to start trading Bakkt.

Probably not, because involving a proofreader would significantly increase the risk of losing anonymity. For instance, no way to anonymously pay a proofreader pre-Bitcoin!
Satoshi knew that remaining anonymous requires flawless language. For instance, a recurring spelling, grammar or style error is a big giveaway especially if Satoshi intended to keep publishing online with his real-world indentity. The uncommon two-spaces-after-a-full-stop pattern has already caused a lot of speculation.
It is impressive that the writings of Satoshi are of impeccable quality. Clearly he was aware of the need, but apart from that he also had the ability to produce flawless English. And, I believe, he must have done so without any outside help.

That’s getting less. Volatility has been decreasing slowly but steadily for years now.


Again a fair point. Bitcoin is still difficult to use as a currency as its swings in value almost forces a merchant to immediately exchange it for fiat.
Risk of losing in fiat terms when receiving bitcoin is decreasing together with volatility decreasing. Unlike a few years ago, it has become feasible to keep bitcoin for a couple days without risking to lose 30%.
Thinking one step further ahead, this allows merchants to receive an entire days of payments over lightning and settle it on-chain once per day, saving dramatically on transaction fees while having a currency risk caused by the volatility of bitcoin during only a single day.
Lastly, volatility is already lower than some fiat currencies and if it decreases further, bitcoin will start to become a truly attractive alternative to fiat currencies.

“For Consensus 2018, Blockstream created 5 separate Issued Asset types representing gifts including Blockstream stickers, shirts, and hoodies. Each asset was issued in the quantity matching its real world inventory equivalent. These assets were then randomly sent to hundreds of paper wallets which were distributed to conference attendees.
Each paper wallet’s public key contained at least one, and in some cases, several different assets. Users could use their Liquid paper wallet to redeem the tokens for each asset it contained. The digital asset was then destroyed, since its physical representation was redeemed.”
So a receiver of an asset on Liquid has to trust that 1) this asset really exists and 2) they will receive it when they try to redeem it.
Sounds an awful lot like the type of trust that money in a bank account forces me to have.
Seriously, how can tokens as proxies to physical assets ever work? This is reintroducing the need for trust that Bitcoin so elegantly got rid of by issuing its own token having value.
And backed by Bitcoin? Looks to me that the assets can be atomically swapped for Bitcoin, but that very different from being backed. It is impossible to back a tokenized assets by a constant amount of Bitcoin because the value of Bitcoin changes continuously compared to that of the asset.
What am I missing?

@_date: 2018-07-04 11:20:27
All this doesn’t take away the fundamental fact that trust is being reintroduced when a worthless token is used as a proxy to an asset in the real world.
What’s interesting about Liquid is that it enables atomically swapping BTC for a token. If a token is for instance a legally enforceable title to for instance a real estate property, then this would potentially obsolete a notary.
On the other hand - does anyone really wish to take on the responsibility of safeguarding the private keys that represents the title to a property, easily worth a couple hundred-thousands?
And what if the private keys of your house have been stolen and the thief comes to take possession of your property? If a token is a legally enforceable contract, then this is not some imaginary scenario. Do we really want to fully rely on a token in a private wallet to be the only and ultimate proof of ownership? Probably not - existing registrations would still be used, defeating the purpose of using a token.
So I don’t immediately see any use for token-as-an-asset-proxy, not for high value items and not for low value items. I wouldn’t mind to be proven wrong, but right now I just don’t see it.

It is not shaming. It is a well needed heads up for users about the consequences of using services to which the Bitcoin software will soon be incompatible. 
These companies have announced they are going to switch to software having alternate consensus rules compared to Bitcoin. Not only that, they fraudulently refer to this B2X altcoin as "Bitcoin" even though it is underspecified, its consensus rules haven't even been finalized, and the entire definition of the coin is based on the bogus concept of "most hashpower wins".
Users have to be made urgently aware in any way possible that these services may replace their BTC with B2X. According to current market rates at BitFinex, the B2X equivalent token trades for 20% of the value of BTC so this would mean users would be duped into incurring an 80% loss from such a fraudulent swap.
Also it will be dangerous to transact around the time of the split. Especially B2X must _never_ be used for any payments as due to the replay attack users are bound to lose the same amount of BTC as well.
Spreading awareness is crucial. Most Bitcoin users are not on Reddit so other channels and languages must be used to warn people.

Also sadly, Barry Silberts' DCG and supporting businesses such as BitPay and Coinbase fraudulently claim that their altcoin is an [upgrade of Bitcoin]( and this false claim can be used to defraud unsuspecting users.
For instance, Coinbase stores their users' Bitcoin but considers 2xc to be the equivalent.

Free news has slaughtered good journalism. Investigative journalism loses money whereas producing clickbait headlines and factually incorrect but sensationalist articles is a profitable business model. Partisan newsmedia have no qualms to bend the truth to fit their narratives.
Journalism hardly has any credibility left. Unsurprisingly populists take full advantage of this credibility crisis by attacking bad _and_ good journalism (“fake news”).
Misinformed voters is what brings power to populists and demagogues.
It is a sad state of affairs and I don’t see how it can stop getting worse. History is repeating itself and it is all very scary.

Veriblock drives up the average transaction fee for all Bitcoin users by creating a business model that depends on free eternal storage on the blockchain. This is damaging to Bitcoin because it makes legitimate usage (transacting) more expensive.
u/luke-jr is correct to qualify Veriblock transactions as spam. Limiting the block size would make their abusive business model fail because there will no longer be any freeloading possible as every transaction would require a fee.
However it is unlikely that there will be consensus for a block size decrease. Perhaps this changes if Lightning transactions become ubiquitous and most transactions happen off-chain. That would be a good time to rethink the block size, especially if mostly only companies get to send free transactions for their own profits. Setting a small minimum transaction fee would also do the job of killing off any freeloading business models.

Mike Hearns' continued dismissal of PoW is somewhat disturbing. No superior alternative to PoW exists.
Bitcoin works by finding consensus. Finding consensus can only work if no single entity can game the outcome by somehow representing a significant percentage (or worse - the majority) of the votes. When voting in a democracy, a person walks up to a voting booth, is identified, casts their vote and is registered to ensure they cannot vote again. In a trustless environment where participants can only interact with each other over communication lines, there are some severe limitations to deal with.
First of all: what should constitute a vote? A person? But how to verify if there is really an actual person behind a vote? And if there is, how to avoid this person from impersonating another person? Remember, all you have is communications. So, as Mike Hearn once suggested, a person may identify themselves with their unique ID which is part of a modern passport. However the problem with this is that lists of these IDs circulate on the net and it is trivial to impersonate hundreds of people. Then, perhaps one IP address to represent one vote? Also problematic as IP addresses can be spoofed and an owner of a large (/8) network could potentially cast millions of votes.
Generalized, the problem is: how to verify by communication only that some entity has exclusive control over a physical good, so that this good can be used as an unspoofable voting token?
Satoshi understood that the only thing that cannot be spoofed is *processing power*. It is impossible to fake the capability to do more calculations per second than you actually can. The key is that processing power proofs exclusive control over actual, unspoofable physical equipment (computers) and *the amount of processing power one has, is verifiable over a communication line*. PoW can be a simple calculation: repeating a one-way hashing function whose outcome is fully random (SHA256). The faster one is, the more computing power one controls, and the more voting power one deserves. This creates a more or less level playing field. In order to get more voting power, one needs to acquire more hashing power (first CPUs, then GPUs, then FPGAs, and currently ASICs). But since anyone can buy hashing power, it becomes cost prohibitive for a single hashing entity to obtain more than half of all hash power. Also, excessive voting power cannot be obtained with some trick - hash power cannot be spoofed.
There is really nothing else that can be conceived which cannot be spoofed over a communication line. (The one exception is perhaps coin ownership, utilized by altcoins which replace PoW by "Proof of Stake", where one cryptographically proofs control over an amount of coin on the blockchain. PoS however is believed to be inherently flawed - but that's a whole different topic.)

I see it differently. Running a node takes time and costs money. Someone running a node therefore makes a conscious decision to support Bitcoin-the-currency. However, this person does likely not wish to support private uses of the blockchain that only benefit a few individuals or a single company. Suppose Factom becomes wildly popular, then this is facilitated for free by people that run nodes. But not all of them will be so pleased about that.
If running a node means supporting any service that is parasitically piggybacking on the blockchain, then I predict that sooner or later, only very few people will be prepared to run a node.
Also, if it is ok to support other uses of the blockchain other than Bitcoin-the-currency, then where are the BIPs for them? So the Bitcoin community can decide if it is a proper use of the Bitcoin infrastructure. Why not propose a BIP for using the blockchain as a general purpose vehicel of storing arbitrary data and add some roomy, 1 MB data fields. Let's see how that goes down.

Bitcoin is a protocol. XT slightly changes the protocol and by doing so it is claiming to become the new true Bitcoin.
This has remarkable similarities to the [embrace, extend and extinguish]( strategy that Microsoft used to employ.
"Embrace: Development of software substantially compatible with a competing product, or implementing a public standard.
Extend: Addition and promotion of features not supported by the competing product or part of the standard, creating interoperability problems for customers who try to use the 'simple' standard.
Extinguish: When extensions become a de facto standard because of their dominant market share, they marginalize competitors that do not or cannot support the new extensions."

The token itself on any blockchain must have value for the system to be sustainable. Bitcoin has value - it can be traded for fiat. However, a blockchain harboring a token that is only a *promise* for value is almost impossible to sustain.
Suppose I hold the private key to an address that represents USD 50. How can I get my actual 50 bucks? Who can I send the 50 bucks on the blockchain to, and receive the fiat in my hands? This is hard to set up in a decentralized way. Charging a small fee for such conversion may work though.
The biggest problem: how can it be guaranteed that all the tokens on the blockchain actually exist in the real world? A fiat blockchain must ensure that the fiat it represents actually exists. That is almost impossible to do in a decentralized way, although I have attempted to dream up a way to [solve this](

"The data contained in the URL query on an HTTPS connection is encrypted. However it is very poor practice to include such sensitive data as a password in the a 'GET' request. While it cannot be intercepted, the data would be logged in plaintext serverlogs on the receiving HTTPS server, and quite possibly also in browser history. It is probably also available to browser plugins and possibly even other applications on the client computer. At most an HTTPS URL could be reasonably allowed to include a session ID or similar non-reusable variable. It should NEVER contain static authentication tokens."

Docker was invented to overcome incompatibilities of differing platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac). However this is not required for Bitcoin Core since it already provides binaries for each three platforms.
The only advantage left is then easy deployment onto cloud platforms. Notice CoinBase stating that more 2X nodes are desperately needed, which makes it safe to assume that we'll soon see large numbers of 2X nodes being spun up from cloud services.

The blockchain is a public ledger containing the history of all transactions and the addresses to all bitcoin. Also, the blockchain allows the movement from bitcoin from one address to another by sending a transaction to the Bitcoin network. This can be done without permission of a third party, by anyone who controls an address, from any network location. In other words: trustless.
In a closed system where the participants are known and interdependent, this trustless property, which is the hardest to achieve, is obsolete. As you yourself indicate, you might as well use a central database.




Ok, I'll play along - suppose that each participant is a miner and the miners cannot fully trust each other. So, how does a blockchain do any good? Since you cannot trust the miners, how can you prevent participants from colluding and take over the network having &gt; 50% of the hashing power? Bitcoin miners depend on the hashing power of thousands of individuals. These individuals can (and will) point there hashing power to a different miner to prevent any miner from getting more than 50% of the total hashing power. But since in your system, the participants are themselves the miners, no such  safety exists. That means that this system can only work if the participants fully trust each other. And in that case, a blockchain is not necessary - a database will do.

His post was meant to defend such wait for segwit. From what I could tell, he wasn’t convinced that Luke-Jr’s BIP148 hardball game was a sound way to get segwit activated, as such strongarming can be used both for good and bad.
In the end he didn’t seem to strongly oppose BIP148 although I don’t think he ever liked the idea. He was right to be reluctant - BIP148 got us segwit but at expense of some minimal damage to being a consensus system. In the grand scheme of things, a decade from now, we may view BIP148 as having been a reckless way for the small benefit of getting segwit one year sooner. But at the time, in the heat of the discussion, and with spam attacks ongoing, BIP148 seemed like a gift from heaven.

Well, NYA claims that B2X is the real Bitcoin because it will have the most accumulated hash power.
If miners indeed switch to the B2X chain at fork point, then the B2X chain will have the most total hash power albeit temporarily.
I am just pointing out that defining the chain with “most accumulated hashpower” as being Bitcoin is absurd, because according to this definition any block at the tip would define what Bitcoin is, since by definition such block that extends the chain has the most accumulated hash power.

1 - Index linked accounts are term deposits. The extra interest is the reward for the additional counterparty risk incurred for locking money up with the bank for a year or more. In fact, the lower the rating for a bank, the higher this interest they (have to) offer. Please link me a bank that gives more interest than the rate of inflation on a _running account_ and that does not have any additional charges.


A govt running a bank? What do you mean?


Fixed term deposit with counterparty risk and opportunity cost, plus penalties for early withdrawals. It must be factored in.
4 - Many opportunistically created copycats rightfully collapse. It is disingenuous to compare Bitcoin with poorly designed altcoins and treat them as part of a single asset class. There really is only one cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) that is furthered by academia, researchers and cryptographers as opposed to hobbyists, scammers and opportunists.
5 - Blocking a bank account is disproportionately impactful, especially in increasingly cashless societies. It is becoming an effective means to strongarm anyone even at just the suspicion of fraud. Saying “fraud is fraud” is naive - a mistake in a tax declaration is also fraud, but does not warrant freezing anyone’s bank account which can have far-reaching consequences.

Think again.
* Your money may receive some interest but definitely not enough to make up for inflation. So you are basically losing a bit of money every day.
* Counterparty risk is real. Banks do go down, Although some of your deposit may be insured, it is reckless to save more than the insured amount in any bank.
* Counterparty risk again. Although deposits are insured, that won’t be of any help if systemic failure takes down entire countries, like Iceland in 2008 causing 15% of the Icelandic population to lose _all_ their savings.
* Currency risk. Although a small risk for currencies like USD, EUR, GBP and CHF, currencies do collapse all the time. See Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and you can add Brazil to the list now (hi, u/jstofli).
* Bank accounts are being [mass-frozen for increasingly light suspicions]( Also, it doesn’t take much to be a marked as a “money launderer”.

At the end of the day, there is a promise (a number on a bank statement supposedly representing my balance, or a token supposedly representing some asset I own). Explain to me then how an oracle makes this any different.
Liquids’ use for exchanges works, because the token represents a Bitcoin so there is a 1-to-1 peg. Also, the Bitcoin and the Liquid tokens are controlled by the same party, so there is no increase in trust required.
In [the Liquid FAQ]( the need for trust is mentioned:
“A sidechain allows a different set of trade-offs that allow privacy and rapid finality of asset transfer at the expense of being a permissioned network and trust of the functionaries.”
However a user already needs to trust an exchange so there’s no increase of risk for this use case.

Notice how 2X nodes are distributed as [Docker]( images. Docker images are easy to deploy cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean and many others.
This means that we can likely soon see hoards of 2X nodes coming live from cloud services, many of which will be running in the same data center, on the same physical machine and even within the same _virtual machine_.
Deploying nodes like this does nothing in terms of decentralization of the network. It just artificially inflates the 2X node count.
It is sad to see to which great lengths Jeff Garzik, Coinbase and the DCG are prepared to go and deceitfully keep up appearances of support. Not to mention the money wasted and the predictable damages to the Bitcoin community of which many unsuspecting members are inevitably going to be duped.

Can you clarify this remarkable claim? Bigger blocks *will* increase bandwidth requirements. Filled up blocks of 8 MB requires bandwidth above the fair use policies of most "unlimited" broadband data plans.


The currently existing centralized payment systems already provide this perfectly fine. The top priority should be to remain decentralized, because that is what lends Bitcoin its value.


Blocks are not even full right now except during transaction spam waves. But clearly the transaction capacity of Bitcoin needs to increase, that is hardly a contentious issue.

If only it were that easy. Raising the limit does not magically make Bitcoin scale. There are inherent limitations to the scalability of Bitcoin other than the block size.

@_date: 2017-10-08 14:39:15
Good decision to move away your bitcoin from CoinBase. Even a better decision to keep them in a hardware wallet.
Make sure you have the seed written down on a piece of paper and stored somewhere save, and in a different location such that a fire won't destroy both your hardware wallet and your paper seed in one go.
The S2X fork creates a copy of the entire blockchain. What this means is that the complete transaction history is copied as well as all keys. In practice this will mean that your bitcoin are being cloned. Your original bitcoin are unaffected but you will automatically have S2X coin on the clone chain as well.
To access them however might be tricky. Wait for instructions from your hardware wallet vendor. Also, it is better not to transact around the time of the hardfork to avoid your coins of being moved on both chains. This can rob you from your cloned coins.
This works as follows. Since S2X blockchain is a clone of Bitcoin, transactions that work on the Bitcoin blockchain also function on the cloned chain unless precautions are taken. Suppose that after the hardfork in November I ask you to pay me 1 BTC. You create a transaction and broadcast it out to the Bitcoin network. First, the transaction lands inside a block, then, a couple more blocks are mined which makes the transaction irreversible and I have received your 1 BTC as intended.
But since the S2X chain is a clone it will also process your transaction just fine. So I maliciously also broadcast the *exact same* transaction on the S2X chain and by doing this I send 1 S2X-coin to myself in addition to your 1 BTC I had already received. Now I have cheated you out of 1 S2X coin. This is called a replay attack.
There are ways to protect yourself from this replay attack. They will likely involve introducing differences between the two chains such that transactions only work on a single blockchain. For instance, if you buy some BTC after the split, then you won't receive the corresponding S2X-coin. Next, you create a transaction that sends both your newly bought and your original bitcoin to a new address. This transaction cannot be replayed on the S2X chain because the newly bought bitcoin don't exist there, and the transaction will be invalid. At this point you have successfully split your coins and you will be able to transact on both chains without fear of your transactions being replayed.

He delivered - this is a reality.


In Europe, contactless payment of small amounts is rapidly becoming the norm. It is fast and free. Just keep your debit card next to the terminal until it beeps and the payment is done. No pin entry, nothing. It takes seconds and did I mention it is free? A quickly increasing number of places do not even accept cash any longer. The only way to pay is by debit card.
Bitcoin is not ready yet to compete in this space. It will not be able to compete if every tiny transaction is stored on the blockchain. It would be cost prohibitive. Systems like the lightning network which settle transactions in bulk can make Bitcoin competitive in the micro payments space.
As Jeff Garzik mentioned, Bitcoin is a *settlement system*. Unlike the small contactless payments above, a Bitcoin transaction *settles* within an hour. It is unfair to compare it to a centralized transaction system which settles its transactions once per day - much slower than Bitcoin.
The best way to neuter Bitcoin is to centralize it. The bandwidth and processing power required settle each and every coffee purchase on blockchain would effectively centralize it into a handful of nodes. Then Bitcoin has become nothing but an inefficient centralized payment system that nobody wants. It would simply be the end of Bitcoin.

A prerequisite to the success of Bitcoin is the absence of any central authority. Its creator understood well that they’d be an authoritative voice in any discussion about the direction of Bitcoin whether they’d like it or not. To avoid becoming a central opinion leader regarding all matters Bitcoin, the creator(s) had no other choice but to remain anonymous.
It is not relevant who created Bitcoin. Everything else about Bitcoin is out in the open.
It’s actually quite the opposite. The bit of remaining trust required for Bitcoin is trusting that their creator(s) stay anonymous and absent for else they’d potentially have the power to make the experiment (which Bitcoin still is) fail.

Keeping your coins on an exchange or with any third party is very risky. Exchanges have a history of becoming insolvent because their coins get stolen because of a for instance a hack or theft by those running the exchange itself.
On top of that, Coinbase thinks B2X is Bitcoin so keeping your coins there exposes you to the risk that after the B2X hardfork they will have converted your Bitcoin into B2X.
Therefore Coinbase should never be used.

Higher returns in exchange for higher risks. Very real risks indeed as people trying to fetch these up to 6.5% interest rates in some cases never got it (Iceland banks) and would have lost their money if it weren’t for the taxpayer to rescue them with billions.


Icelandic banks that went down and building societies that were close to going down. See below.


Taxpayer money and as a matter of fact, it took until 2016 before the UK government recovered the 4.5 billion pounds after the default of Landesbanki.


Because it comes with an increasedrisk of losing ones’ money. So it’s not “free money”.


The extra interest is only paid out if the bank doesn’t default during the period in which the money is locked up. This is not an imaginary risk.
“Landsbanki had big retail operations overseas, accepting deposits in Britain and the Netherlands under the Icesave brand. When it failed, Iceland’s banking insurance scheme was unable to cover those deposits, setting the stage for years of international litigation.

Just to make sure I am reading what you wrote as you intended it, let me rephrase it. Feel free to correct:
When a miner finds a new B2X block, it is broadcast out to all B2X nodes in the network. By definition, each B2X node runs consensus rules that accepted all blocks ever produced up until and including the block just found.


Agree. If I receive a block then the consensus rules of my own node decide whether to accept or reject the block. However I obviously cannot decide over what _consensus_ rules others run.


Rejecting blocks that others accept means removing myself from the network completely and I will no longer be able to access my coin. But yes, I can go along with any new consensus rules just to get my coin out, if that’s what you mean. But then I am not rejecting consensus rules, I am still accepting them in order to remain part of the network for else I can no longer access my coin.


I assume you mean miners with  “they” and the consensus rules by “it”.


I don’t really have a choice as pointed out above, unless you consider removing myself from the network and forfeiting my coin is a valid choice.


So now you are talking about a change that I oppose.


Again, I don’t really have a choice. How else am I going to access my coin without going along with the new rules?


If a mandatory 5% fee were introduced as a consensus rule, no one would adopt the new node software.


No, no, no. In the B2X model, users follow the consensus rules that miners dictate. Currently, miners follow the consensus rules that its users running nodes dictate.

Cryptocurrencies will never go away, just like the internet will never go away. The cat is out of the bag - cryptocurrencies have real utility that warrants their continued existence. Bitcoin enables trustless, private, cheap and fast value transfers over the internet - something that is otherwise impossible. There will always be a market for that. Even if possession of Bitcoin were to be made illegal in the US this might set it back a few years, but it will not die as long as there is demand for the unique properties of Bitcoin. Without a doubt, making it illegal  cause it to shapeshift and become more private. The only way for Bitcoin to permanently fail is when it is being replaced by a superior altcoin. Given the current momentum of Bitcoin, this will not happen any time soon, if ever.
The current episode in the history of Bitcoin where it finds new lows is interesting and undoubtly reduces the number of speculators. I am sure many who expected Bitcoin to hold its value or rise have been greatly disappointed and some of them are probably now trolling this forum. But I think it is sane to take a step back and look at the fundamentals of why Bitcoin exists, see notice steady development on Bitcoin Core as well as its ecosystem, and realize that the price of the day is not all that significant.

There is no central authority which excludes or includes people. Contributions are judged on their merits, not on the person.

The very *title* of the Bitcoin whitepaper demands Bitcoin to have small blocks.
The notion of "peer-to-peer" is fully equivalent to being **trustless**: there is no third party controlling the money in the transaction at any point in time.
To achieve such a feat, Bitcoin must remain as decentralized as possible, as increased centralization enables control over transactions by an increasingly small group of people.
Big blocks increase centralization, which runs counter to being peer-to-peer.

True. But a Bitcoin transaction is not free either. User pays, and not just the transaction fee.

I guess a derivative is needed for that. I just checked BitMEX but I didn't see a suitable contract.
I suppose we need an ultra-short term future so that payment processors like Bitpay, Coinbase, Rebit etc. can lock in a price for one or two hours, so they can present a final price to the user and hedge the short term volatility risk. Then they are protected against dropping bitcoin prices while waiting for confirmations.

These parasites are the reason that the block size cannot be raised. Abuse of scarce blockchain space must always increase the cost of doing so up to a point that any business model depending on storing data on-chain will fail.

A crucial property of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized.  A service depending on a central server can easily be shut down (as done with Napster for instance). For Bitcoin to retain trustworthy, it must not be possible to shut it down by shutting down a couple of servers. Not many people would put faith in a currency that depends on a few specific servers to be up and running.
Nodes are what make Bitcoin decentralized. They form the peer-to-peer backbone of Bitcoin. Without nodes, Bitcoin cannot exist.
The number of nodes is declining. Currently there are only about 6000 nodes worldwide. Running a node requires a lot of bandwidth, both up and downstream. The bandwidth required is proportional to the size of a block. If blocks become larger, the bandwidth requirements increase. If blocks become too large, the number of nodes is expected to decline to levels which threatens the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Running a node takes time, effort, hardware and bandwidth while offering no monetary compensation.
If there will not be enough nodes left, Bitcoin will become vulnerable to new types of attacks that can threaten its existence. The fear of such fatal attacks on Bitcoin manifests itself by a declining price.
It is therefore crucial that the number of nodes stay at a healthy level. Increasing the block size by too much can reduce the number of nodes so much that Bitcoin is effectively no longer decentralized and will no longer be considered a viable alternative currency by many.

I like to assume nothing but good intentions on the part of Core devs and who I highly respect.
Perhaps their thinking is a bit binary: either a transaction is not confirmed and therefore does not reliably exist (to which I fully agree), or a transaction is in a block with 6 confirmations, at which point it can be considered to have become irreversible (again completely accurate).
But this binary thinking does not recognize that there is a world in between these two extremes, with gradually increasing levels of confidence a transaction is going to make it to 6 confirmations.
Usability of Bitcoin is greatly enhanced when the probability of reaching 6 confirmations is as high as possible as early as possible. A merchant may accept 0-conf low value payments if the probability of a double spend is very small. However if the probability increases, the treshold value at which a merchant is willing to accept a 0-conf transaction decreases proportionally. The merchant has *amount* x P(*doublespend*) at risk, so if P(*doublespend*) increases, the amount will decrease. That in turn hurts the usability and ultimately the value of Bitcoin as a whole.

It’s interesting to note that one of the appeals of owning a house is preservation of capital.
Bitcoin may at some point begin to have that appeal as well and start to compete with house ownership.
There is plenty more appeals to owning a house, but Bitcoin can substitute for this one major appeal that lends significant value to a house.
In a future where Bitcoin is seen as a stable and save store of value, real estate may no longer be the standard pick for value preservation, and owning a house may be valued in a more practical perspective, similar to renting vs. buying a car.
This effect may slightly reduce the appeal and with that the price of real estate, since housing will have become slightly less attractive as an investment with Bitcoin being there as an alternative.

I see. So basically it enables a payer to negotiate over the fee amount. But in a rather clumsy way. A payer has to keep an eye on his transaction to see whether it gets included into a block, and when it doesn't, use RBF. The time between sending the initial transaction and the RBF transaction can be hours.
Much better it would be if a payer can just send off a transaction once and still can be certain that it will be accepted eventually. The transaction should be structured such that it lets miners compete on fee amount.
Technically I imagine the payer sends this all at once.
Imagine that the next block is block number B. The payer sends the following three transactions all at once with increasing fee amounts:
Tx1: pay with fee f (normal tx).
Tx2: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee f+i1; do not include into a block before block B+1.
Tx3: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee x+i2 (i2 &gt; i1); do not include into a block before block B+2.
Each miner has the following two simple options:
Include Tx1 in block B for a low fee.
Do not include Tx1 in block B. This has a high probability of losing out on the transaction fee, but if blocks are full and all other transactions carry a higher fee amount then this is an economically rational decision.
If a miner that did not include Tx1 finds block B, then Tx1 remains unconfirmed and in the mempool.
Both Tx1 as well as Tx2 carrying a higher fee can now be included into block B+1. Tx2 is now more likely to be included into block B+1 because each miner is more likely to want to secure the higher fee carried by Tx2. Still an altruistic miner may still chose to accept Tx1 and its lower fee.
If Tx2 is still not included, Tx3 becomes eligible for inclusion carrying a yet higher fee.
The end result is that the payer just sends off three transactions of which only one can be included, but such that it forces miners to compete on fees. By looking at the fee amounts of the transactions, the payer as well as the receiver can know the probability of the payment being settled, which will approach 100% if the payment includes a transaction with a non-zero transaction fee.
The only change needed to make this work I guess is for miners being able to recognize that three transactions having the same inputs and outputs but differing fee amounts are not a double spend attempt but a negotiation of the fee amount.
If I am not mistaken it is perhaps already possible now without *any* changes to Core.

This statement shows that SWIFT does not understand Bitcoin.
Cross border currency transfers are expensive because of banks making money on them, and not because of some technological inefficiency. Using Bitcoin technology is not going to make cross border transfers any cheaper.
Apart from that, it is not even possible to take only parts of Bitcoins' technology. The blockchain, mining and the reward scheme are inseparable.
Bitcoins' main achievement is distributed consensus finding, meaning agreeing on something in a decentralized way. SWIFT is centralized decision maker and has therefore no such requirement.
For all these reasons, SWIFT looking to Bitcoin to improve their system is a non-starter.
It would be way more useful if SWIFT would investigate on how to develop an interface with the Bitcoin world. Sooner or later, there will be demand for this as Bitcoin slowly creeps into mainstream finance.

I just observed that increased adoption has not led to any increase in the number of nodes.
This is indeed likely because of people preferring SPV and web wallets, which require a fraction of the bandwidth and disk space compared to a full node. I don't think that's a coincidence.


That's misleading. Blocks have been steadily increasing in size and therefore the rate at which the blockchain grows has also increased. Bandwidth, cpu and disk space requirements have increased hugely while at the same time the number of people running a full node has dropped considerably.
So there seems to be a clear relationship between increasing resource requirements and the dropping number of nodes. The increasing level of adoption has not changed this trend at all.

Given the financial muscle of BitMain and their existing infrastructure, they will be the first to dominate again after any PoW change.
Ofcourse there hopefully would be a level playing field again but a new PoW using a new hash function has new optimizations to be discovered which can again be patented and be used to push other miners out. Again BitMain is likely to be the company having the best engineers to find optimizations that gives them a decisive long-term advantage again.
Keeping a well understood algorithm like SHA256 has the advantage that it is a more or less level playing field as it is likely that most optimizations have been discovered and are known to all ASIC manufacturers.

For Bitcoin to function, there must be sufficient volunteers available that are willing to donate significant bandwidth and disk space to run a node. No financial compensation is offered.
A volunteer who runs a node that eats up significant bandwidth currently will do so in order to support Bitcoin, mostly having ideological motives. But when alternate applications are stacked on top of the blockchain, running a node means also supporting applications that often have nothing to do with Bitcoin. This may reduce the number of volunteers that are willing to run a node. They have no incentive to support a swath of often ill-conceived applications that abuse the blockchain as if it is some "free" distributed storage system. It is not free, the bill is mostly paid by those who run a node.
I am of the opinion that the blockchain should be used exclusively to support Bitcoin. Watering down the blockchain with Bitcoin-alien applications that also can significantly increase the bandwidth and disk space required to run a node will inevitably decrease the number of volunteers that run a node. Instead of just supporting Bitcoin, they are now forced to donate additional bandwidth for supporting applications that have nothing to do with Bitcoin and which they may not wish to support at all.
Especially those who donate their time, bandwith and disk space to support Bitcoin and run a node purely for ideological reasons may pull the plug on their node.

...at which point all miners will have the transaction in their mempool and double spend has become impossible if all miners have adopted the policy in which the first-seen transaction gets included into the next block.
Using RBF any transaction can basically be cancelled  as long as no new block has been created, so for minutes. Since zero-conf transactions are relied upon by payment processors to accept a payment in seconds, RBF has some serious adverse impact on usability.
Unless a transaction type exists that is such that it can never be RBF-ed. Wallets could use that type instead and make sure a high enough fee is attached.

Isn't it possible to create a transaction type that acts only as a fee to an existing transaction? In other words: the stuck transaction can be unstuck by adding extra fee, but it cannot change the output address or anything else.
Ofcourse, the transaction that adds a fee must carry a fee for itself, so it should only be admitted to the mempool if it can both pay for itself and add fee to the stuck transaction.

Agree. Having more options is good.


How high would your success rate be if a merchant or more realistically - a payment processor having more sophisticated double spend detection techniques would wait for three, five, ten seconds before considering the payment reliable enough?
Within a timeframe of just a few seconds the probability in which they would detect your double spend attempt approaches certainty.
So although double spending can not be avoided, its chances of remaining undetected decreases to very low probabilities after seconds, allowing payment processors to accept low value transactions with zero confs.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:38:21


If time between blocks would be exactly 10 minutes, then the average time available for RBFeeing a transaction would be 5 minutes. But since the time between blocks is a Poisson distribution, the average is higher, ~~but lower than 10 minutes~~ and as I learned from other comments, indeed *equal* to 10 minutes. You win :-)
Anyway my point is that it would be madness to *rely*  on being able to RBF a transaction as if it were some undo-option. It would be playing with fire and surely a lot of people would be unlucky enough to find that the transaction they wanted to replace happened to have already been included into the next block.

True, but the *probability* becomes very high after just a few seconds.
This high probability is what allows merchants to consider a low value 0-conf transaction as final and deliver the goods.
For the merchant, the amount at risk is *amount* x P(*doublespend*).
If the probability of double spending increases, the amount a merchant is willing to accept as 0-conf will decrease proportionally assuming the risk appetite is constant.
So overall an increasing double spend probability decreases the usability of Bitcoin as a whole.

Wonder how they intend to make a guaranteed 5% with their BTC deposits.
I don't see how this is possible. If they don't keep the deposit in BTC then they risk losing out during periods of huge gains like now. If they keep the deposits in BTC then they can't make 5%. So, how?

It is mainly BitMain and its opportunistic CEO Jihan Wu who is sabotaging segwit and other advances to the Bitcoin protocol just because it kills covert AsicBoost and their unfair mining advantage with it.
Segwit has overwhelming community support which is why Jihan Wu won't be able to keep sabotaging it forever. Apart from that, work is underway to make the use of covert AsicBoost impossible - hopefully that will change his tune already.
He had his fun and I am sure BitMain profited handsomely from his admittedly genius trick, but the time will soon come to leave contention behind us and for everyone to rejoin and work together to make Bitcoin great.

Cool, Bitcoin is doing it's work behind the scenes:

Greg Maxwell (who drafted the [kill-covert-AsicBoost BIP]( has been completely quiet about its progress AFAICT except for his statement shortly after drafting it being that he had shown it to other devs and that "[they did not vomit all over it]( (see more interesting comments from Greg in [this thread](
At the same time, [he is not in favor of BIP148]( but advocated switching to segwit in July 2018 using BIP149 which means no segwit for over a year and $100 mio windfall profit for BitMain that has shown to spend money to increase their control over the Bitcoin ecosystem - it looks like BitPay is in their pocket now. That is a bit hard to swallow.
Given that he considers covert AsicBoost to be an attack (and rightly so) one would think that the kill-covert BIP is treated with urgency. And maybe it is - perhaps he likes to keep quiet about it for tactical reasons. But there's no indication that anything is happening.
He's very active on reddit and I am certain he has seen the repeated requests for an update regarding this BIP but for some reason he keeps quiet.
Not sure what's going on.
Relating price action to events is tricky but it just so happened that the price of BTC took a 10% nosedive within four hours and the decline started directly after Greg speaking out in favor of doing BIP149 instead of BIP148. The increase from 1200 to 2200+ and the coincidental decrease in price for LTC might well be attributed to growing believe in BIP148 being successful and resulting in the activation of segwit.

*Palatinus, however, believes the risks of BIP 101 are being exaggerated, explaining:*
“Improved block compression solutions will be able to vastly decrease the risk of oversized risks in regard of centralization of mining."
I'm afraid Palatinus is misinformed. Blocks cannot be compressed much because they contain mainly binary data. In each block there is a significant amount of random data which cannot be compressed at all.
But it makes sense for a miner to be in favor of BIP 101. If the block size cap increases more than Bitcoin can handle then miners will be having more power with regards to actual block sizes, since they can chose to create smaller blocks. A large increase of the cap therefore yields more power to miners, which can be an incentive for miners to be in favor of a large increase of the block size limit.

Well said indeed!
An unsettled payment is nothing but a promise from a trusted party that eventually you will receive the money. And this "settlement" is with your bank account, and not with *you* directly. Trust in the bank is still required. If you get the notes from the ATM, trust is still required in the country or entity that issues the currency - there is risk of debasement as recently happened in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Zimbabwe and probably some others I don't know about.
With Bitcoin, each of these levels of trust are no longer required, which is nothing short of a paradigm shift.
And besides - buying bitcoin on an exchange is also a Bitcoin transaction! So that means Bitcoin is already supporting hundreds if not thousands of Bitcoin transactions per second today! Or is anyone going to argue that these are not real transactions? Because they definitely are!
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:27:33
My guess would be that the market is growing more confident that segwit will become reality for Bitcoin.
* The uncovering of Covert AsicBoost by Greg Maxwell and his BIP (in progress) to neuter it takes away BitMains' incentive to oppose segwit.
* Segwit will be activated on Litecoin which moves it from a testnet-funny-money environment into a more hostile real-value production environment. This removes the opposition that segwit is untested in a relevant real-value system.
* Segwit signalling is slowly rising, now at 35%.
* The spreading realization that segwit adds tremendous value to Bitcoin which is reconfirmed by the dramatic 400% increase in price of Litecoin which [fully attributable]( to segwit.
However, there are also some nagging issues:
* Bitfinex situation. Is the price being pumped higher by people with Taiwanese bank accounts selling BTC at Bitfinex and rebuying BTC elsewhere? This should cause the price gap to close but it is stll around USD 100 now. So perhaps this arbitrage is not being performed at a significant scale. What happens if Bitfinex resumes normal operations? What happens if Bitfinex goes gox?
* The awkward rise of ETH. Has there been any technological advances to ETH that justifies this rise? Or is it being pumped, artificially inflating prices across the board? If this bubble pops, how will BTC be affected?

Covert AsicBoost can still be used to mine blocks not containing any segwit transactions. However, it wouldn't be so covert any more as it would be pretty safe to say that any blocks without segwit transactions are likely to be AsicBoost mined.

It's normal. And because of the gradual increase in the number of transactions, block sizes have been increasing as well. The time it takes to download a block is higher on average for newer blocks because they contain more transaction and are larger in size. That is why the speed seems to slow down.
Thinking of this, a better progress bar would show the number of transactions or even better, just the number of MB instead of the number of blocks.

According to the IMF report cited by this the Guardian article:


And currencies of emerging economies have collapsed. The Ruble and Brazilian Real have lost some 50% of their value this year. Other currencies did even worse (see Kazachstan, Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, ...).
The IMF goes on to say:


No surprise there: because of the near-zero interest rates, investors chose to invest their money into corporate bonds, hoping to get at least some returns. In a normally functioning economy, corporates would not be able to loan at such favorable low rates. On the other hand, pension funds that historically received 4-5% of interest on their cash now see these returns plummet to zero and are driven into the more risky bonds and stock markets, while seeing their returns diminish regardless. Therefore, it is safe to say that the zero interest rates is subsidizing large corporates at the expense of current and future pensioners.
If that weren't bad enough, the problems in the global economy have not been resolved, on the contrary:


So according to the IMF, cheap zero-interest money has been invested into emerging markets which has created a fourfold in corporate debt into a dazzling $18 trillion.
Given the plummeting commodity prices and the sorry state of emerging economies which have seen their currencies also plummet and in the case of China are suffering from a real estate bubble, it seems more and more clear that indeed we live at times where predicting a next financial crash is not just alarmist crazy talk - it has become a believable scenario.

You as a sender and the payee as the receiver both enjoy a bit of value somehow by choosing to use Bitcoin over other options. If that weren't the case, you both would have been opting to use an alternative way to exchange money.
Imagine what would happen if a couple of successful business models emerge that depend on storing data in the Blockchain and which are still profitable even if the fee were to rise all the way to USD 25.00 per transaction.
At that point, Bitcoin is dead as a peer to peer cash system as hardly anyone would want to use Bitcoin for any transactions because of the exorbitant fees. However, a couple of successful business have now hijacked the blockchain for their own gains - perhaps a timestamping service or a maybe dog-remembrance service that stores pictures of peoples deceased dogs on the blockchain 'for all eternity'.
I don't think anyone would be happy if such a dog-remembrance would be filling up the blockchain and driving up the fees for everyone else. The intended use of Bitcoin is the trustless exchange of cash and that use must be protected.

Scheduling a hardfork without evaluating the results of SegWit first would be a mistake.
After SegWit much more information will be available that help establishing whether on-chain transaction capacity needs another doubling. Also, signature aggregation adds another 30% capacity.

All these extras that you list are ofcourse paid by *you* out of your own pocket together with the merchant. And these hardly ever used extras are being overpriced as well.
It seems a freebee because there is no extra charge. But the charge is spread evenly across *all* buyers - also those not paying and not getting these "freebees" are forced to pay for it.
Basically you are tricked into using your credit card and the nice "gifts" offered are partly paid out of your own pocket and partly by the merchant whose margins are eroded due to the cc transaction fee which is typically 3% of the amount.
So while the cc company poses as a generous Santa Claus, their useless gifts are actually being paid for by customers and merchants. It's hypocrite.
On top of that, your financial privacy is affected because cc companies sell your complete purchase history to enable targeted advertisements.

I don't understand the use case of being able to basically *cancel* your own transaction while it is in the mempool.
This goes much further than releasing a stuck transaction.
Much more sense it would make that *anyone* can add fee to *any* transaction. But not change anything else. This for instance allows a receiver to add fee to a transaction directed to him, so he does not have to rely on the sender for that. He can then be sure that a mempool transaction will not change its destination address and he will be the receiver.
Generally, I would think Bitcoin would have to move to a once-seen-in-mempool-can't-change-it principle, so double spending has little chance.

How about having nodes dropping these kinds of blockchain abusing transactions.
In general, I think the blockchain should be redesigned such that no random data can be stored. As in, none, none at all.
So, no OP_RETURN. Want new functionality? Do a BIP, don't abuse OP_RETURN.
Also, no vanity addresses. Have Bitcoin Core put a hashed version of an address in the blockchain so data can not be hidden inside addresses. Users can still use normal addresses, but only the hashed version should be stored in the blockchain. When sending bitcoin to an address, use either the hashed or the not-yet-hashed address.
Eradicate any other ways to hide data in the blockchain to a point where the number of transactions required to store any significant amount of data gets so high that it becomes impractical.

Right after it was announced back in October 2015 that Mr. Craig Wright would attend the Bitcoin forum on the invitation of Bitcoin Belle, I spent 15 minutes of googling him while brushing my teeth.
That was more than enough effort to understand that this guy is full of shit. In a [hastily removed, but commented on video]( 2014 he boasts about his supercomputer having) he boasts about his supercomputer having 770 Petabytes of RAM, which would have cost about half a billion USD at the time. Apart from that, the video is so cringeworthy that it's all I needed to dismiss him as an idiot. But there's more than enough materials left on the interwebs to reach the same conclusion today, I am sure.
It is easy to understand the apparent misguidedness of the media knowing that gutter journalists care mainly about the number of eyeballs on their story. Just like Leah McGrath Goodman got her 15 minutes of fame at the expense of an old, quite vulnerable, reclusive and retired man that happened to have Nakamoto as his last name. He had the misfortune of getting Leah at his doorstep and next thing he knew, he had become a Newsweek cover story. And extra copies they sold!
With the Mr. Craig Wright case it is easy to see how modern "journalism" operates. There is no money in flat-out dismissing Mr. Craig Wright as Satoshi. There is money to be made in creating doubt and dragging it on as long as possible, luring readers with "new facts" and "developments" in a fantasy story.
This will probably continue to happen - finding Satoshi is a cash cow and sure to generate hits and ad revenue. Why would a gutter journalist care about anything other than that? Unless having a reputation at stake, just play along and milk that cow with made-up leads.
It is the sad state of journalism today, that apparently reputable reporters are now also playing this game. Because it is hard to believe that a serious reporter would fall for Craigs claim being Satoshi, let alone for 3 months.

Huh? Core devs are not participating in this farce.


There has never been much debate about the value of segwit. Almost the entire community is behind it.

Ah yeah, the voice of reason speaks!


Why would the Bitcoin community compromise on anything with a handful companies that from the looks of it have zero power to stop segwit and especially BitMain that has been trying to sabotage progress? Seems we're doing BIP148, no need to compromise on anything but thanks anyway!

Segwit opposing hashpower is well over 50%. Seems to me (but not sure if it works like this) that the non-segwit hashpower can just keep on mining the non-segwit chain and the segwit chain won't ever become the longest chain. What happens in such scenario?

A key is nothing else than a very large number. To proof that you have the correct private (secret) key, Bitcoin will ask you to do a calculation with this number. This is called "signing".
The outcome of this calculation is again a very large number. This number has a special power - it is a number that will provide a correct outcome when used in yet another calculation.
For the owner of the private key it was very easy to find this special number. But without the private key, the special number can only be found by trying numbers randomly, which is infeasible.

Perhaps I am not thinking this through enough but consider the economic decision one will have at its disposal: earn a percentage without risk (except for exchange rate risk) or invest.
The decision to invest will be taken more prudently if money can be earned risk-free. In fact, the current near zero interest rates might very well be the cause of the currently stagnating economies world wide. Due to low rates investors are driven into more risky and questionable investments than in a normally functioning economy where they would simply earn some interest in a bank account. This has all the potential to create bubbles, crashes and economic shocks.
A cryptocurrency which offers investors a risk-free return can mop up this money preventing it from being invested in risky ventures and thus inflating bubbles. A rational investor will then only invest money when it expects a better return than the risk-free rate.
Perhaps an altcoin can implement such a scheme - it is true that Bitcoin is committed to the 21M cap and should never change that.

No, really absolutely no. It's *cash*. A Bitcoin transaction *settles irreversibly* as if it were a cash transaction such as a banknote changing hands.
Bitcoin being used to exchange what basically are IOUs is a non-starter. If you receive some token representing some value, how do you know you'll actually legally own it, and even if you do, how do you know that you can actually have it in your hands? And even if you legally own it *and* can access it, the asset might be damaged or - for instance in the case of art - a fake. There's a lot of trust there. However, if you receive bitcoin, you know you're all good.


Sure there is - it can be made more expensive and even impossible to store data in the blockchain by closing avenues that allow storing of arbitrary data.

Why? Setting up Bitcoin and getting fiat in and out of bitcoin is integral part of using Bitcoin and defines a big part of the experience.

Timelocking bitcoin got me thinking. Should it earn interest?
What if it would? Let's assume a point far in the future where big swings in the BTC exchange rate no longer occur.
This can have explosive economic implications - interest guarantees a return and so it defines the risk-free rate. Any other investment returning less than the risk-free rate would be less attractive. Again, except for the currency risk which is relatively large for BTC.
But let's dream on. Say Bitcoin interest is 3% annualized on timelocked coins. So if you lock BTC 100 for one year, you receive BTC 103. That would be quite something. It might well blow up zero-rate interest policies worldwide as money would be converted to 3% earning BTC.
The question ofcourse is where this 3 BTC will come from. Lift the 21M BTC cap? That is almost blasphemy but I can see how there is a case for it. Everone owning BTC pays for the interest.
And the amount of inflation would be very very low - even if all BTC were timelocked, in our example the inflation would still only be 3%.
I'm quite excited about the prospects of this idea actually.

A merchant or payment processor receiving a payment for a small amount can chose to accept it after a few seconds because the chances that it is double spent are minimal. It can happen, but chances are miniscule once a transaction has fully propagated.
However in the new situation the chances have become much higher since everyone can now cancel his own transaction as long as it is still in the mempool.


Therefore the consequence of RBF will be that merchants and payment processors will reduce the maximum amount at which they will accept a zero-conf transaction. This hurts usability.


So is it possible to send a transaction that is not RBF-able?


Ok which is it? Possible or not?
@_date: 2015-11-29 17:47:20
Let me first point out that [RBF transactions are opt-in]( so they *add value* to the Bitcoin ecosystem as they enable extra functionality. *Edit: the link points to a super insightful comment of I encourage everyone to read it.*


This has so many problems.
* The original transaction can trivially easily be replaced by the sender with a new transaction having a different destination address. The receiver of an RBF-able transaction (merchant) will therefore wait in more cases until the transaction gets into a block before they considers it is safe to assume the transaction will eventually become irreversible. In other words: a merchant is likely to only accept RBF- able transactions for very small amounts or not at all. Edit: although points out that a determined double spender can remain completely undetected by sending transactions directly to miners, causing the double spend transaction to be first seen when it is in a block, in other words when it is too late. Reportedly millions have been lost by this scheme - it is not just some theoretical possibility. Again follow the link to his comment above where explains this in more detail.
* The user experience is horrible. If blocks become full, do we want a situation in which users have to bring their wallet online an hour after doing a transaction in order to let it check if said transaction made it into a block? So the wallet gets the chance to RBF it in case it didn't? That's just a horrendous and completely unintuitive user experience.
So basically it seems RBF enables a payer to negotiate over the fee amount. But in a rather clumsy way. A payers wallet has to keep an eye on their transaction to see whether it gets included into a block, and when it doesn't, use RBF. The time between sending the initial transaction and the RBF transaction can be hours.
It would be more smooth and intuitive if a payer can just instruct a wallet once to do a payment and still can be highly certain that it will be accepted eventually. The wallet should structure a payment such that it allows miners to compete on fee amount.
Technically I imagine the wallet pays by sending multiple transactions simultaneously in such a way that it forces miners to compete on fee. Unless I am overlooking something, I think this is already possible now with *only wallet software changes*. It goes like this:
Imagine that the next block is block number B. The payer sends the following three transactions all at once with increasing fee amounts:
Tx1: pay with fee f (normal tx).
Tx2: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee f+i1; do not include into a block before block B+1.
Tx3: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee x+i2 (i2 &gt; i1); do not include into a block before block B+2.
Each miner has the following two simple options:
Include Tx1 in block B for a low fee.
Do not include Tx1 in block B. This has a high probability of losing out on the transaction fee, but if blocks are full and all other transactions carry a higher fee amount then this is an economically rational decision.
If a miner that did not include Tx1 finds block B, then Tx1 remains unconfirmed and in the mempools.
Both Tx1 as well as Tx2 carrying a higher fee can now be included into block B+1. Tx2 is now more likely to be included into block B+1 because each miner is more likely to want to secure the higher fee carried by Tx2. Still an altruistic miner may still chose to accept Tx1 and its lower fee.
If Tx2 is still not included, Tx3 becomes eligible for inclusion carrying a yet higher fee.
The end result is that the payer just sends off three transactions of which only one can be included, but such that it forces miners to compete on fees. By looking at the fee amounts of the transactions, the payer as well as the receiver can know the probability of the payment being settled, which will approach 100% if the payment includes a transaction with a non-zero transaction fee.
The only change needed to make this work I guess is for miners being able to recognize that three transactions having the same inputs and outputs but differing fee amounts are not a double spend attempt but a negotiation of the fee amount.
If I am not mistaken it is perhaps already possible now without *any* changes to Core.

Bolting proof of existence on top of the Bitcoin blockchain is an ill-conceived idea. The hype around it is undeserved. Counterparty, colored coins, Bitproof etc. are basically abusing the Bitcoin blockchain to store data which has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Their data does not belong there - the blockchain is just seen as a convenient data structure kept alive by the altruistic motives of a small, shrinking group of people that spend their free time, equipment and gigabytes of bandwidth per month run a node. They do this mostly for ideological reasons - to support the reinvention of money. These people which are crucial for the health of Bitcoin might not be interested in donating their resources in supporting a hyped up startup company that latches on the blockchain.
Then the concept of proof of ownership through the blockchain is fundamentally flawed. For instance, with bitproof it can be proofed that a person had access to a file no later than a specific point in time. That is no proof of ownership. The same is true for colored coins. Suppose your car is in the blockchain in the form of a colored coin. Suppose next that a hacker gets access to the private key. Can the hacker now claim ownership of your car? That won't work - the colored coin in itself is not a legally binding proof of ownership in the real world.
Counterparty is flawed in the sense that it is nearly impossible to do any serious trading on the platform, illustrated painfully obviously by the fact that trading between BTC and XCP (the counterparty coin) happens mostly *outside* Counterparty. It is trading mostly on regular exchanges, highlighting the fact that the platform is bypassed for a very trivial use case.

The negativity is largely due to outright dismissal of the possibility that money can be created by software.
And anyone will have to admit how counterintuitive the entire concept is. After all, software has bugs, computers have virusses, anything digital can be copied effortlessly. How on earth can such a thing as digital money possibly exist?
Those who get beyond this understandable initial scepticism and take the effort to have a closer into Bitcoin have a chance of comprehending why it can work.
And by sticking around, Bitcoin also proofs to the rest of the world that indeed money can be created successfully by an algorithm implemented by mere software.

It frustrates me that there don't seem to be any updates but who am I to stamp my feet. I sincerely hope this BIP goes into 0.14.2 because the unfair advantage over other miners and that likely has given BitMain &gt; 50% of the hash power must absolutely be removed with urgency.

That's really strange because it is a doubling in capacity and open the door to further increases. Jihan hasn't been able to change anyone's mind - which is segwit first, then evaluate, then perhaps a further increase if it can be justified.
Jihan is doing a lousy job of making his case and is getting more and more isolated. The only reasons I can see for Jihan to keep opposing segwit is his pride or some unknown monetary incentive.
Segwit has given LTC a 5 times increase in price, which is a crystal clear signal that it's a highly desired improvement.
I think Jihan is a smart guy and not deluded into thinking he can singlehandedly force a HF blocksize increase before segwit goes live. I am hopeful that he will change his stance and join the pro-progress camp of Bitcoin that has overwhelming support.

Fee estimation invites gaming and spamming the blockchain. Wallets should have a max fee and err on the low side rather than calculating a too high fee.

In my view, Bitcoin should be a consumer product. I hope that in the future using Bitcoin will be very similar to using a regular bank account - which is something many people are familiar with.
For instance: the ability to have a permanent Bitcoin address that is like a bank account number. Like a stealth address, but shortened. Preferably a 8 or 9 digit number that is derived deterministically from for instance a stealth address. Call it a Bitaccount number.
Next step: connecting the Bitaccount number to the SWIFT network so it acts like a regular bank account and can receive and send funds. SWIFT connected banks and/or Coinbase or Bitpay to do the currency convertions and act as a gateway.
Have USD / EUR denominated wallets that hedge the fiat value under the hood using bitcoin derivatives.

This does absolutely nothing for Bitcoin except take space on the blockchain - a negative.
I invite anyone to explain how software which uses the Blockchain as a cheap distributed storage and settlement system is any good for Bitcoin-the-currency.
Also I would like to point out the glaringly obvious fact that storing assets in the blockchain is not trustless.
You may hold the private key to a couple of satoshi that is supposed to represent your Picasso, but how do you plan to enforce that? And what if your private key is stolen, will the Picasso no longer be yours, legally? If I get my hands on your private keys, can I then come to your house with policemen and get "my" Picasso? After all, the private key proofs I am the owner, right?
And if not, then what is the point of storing ownership in the Blockchain? Because then it seems that apparently having the private keys to a property is not sufficient to claim it.
In short storing assets on the blockchain is pointless and does not add any value to Bitcoin.

Wth... I answered it straight. The value of the Bitcoin network is the sum of the value for all individual users. Miners are not users btw, they provide a paid service.


What do you actually mean by "the network"? I suppose everyone transacting bitcoin? For only the users are to be considered when talking about the value of Bitcoin - it is them that creates the value of Bitcoin. Without users, no Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is software which is continuously being improved, so Bitcoin gradually expands its number of viable use cases.
Companies jumping into the Bitcoin space often do so to gain a first mover advantage. They take a gamble regarding the viability of their business model - being first often has highest priority. But ofcourse such gambles often turn out wrong.
The next boost in usability is segwit which offers cheaper and more on-chain settlements as well as better wallets. The main promise however is Lightning Network which allows instant, near-trustless, private off-chain payments. This is a huge leap in terms of use cases and has the potential to push Bitcoin mainstream. It will take some years for the technology to mature, but it certainly looks like a game changer.

I hope that the very legitimate bandwidth concerns of Bitcoin can somehow be addressed.
But I wonder what the 16-fold block size increase will do. Also, there are projects popping up that abuse the blockchain as some sort of free cloud public drive.
In my opinion, data which has nothing to do with Bitcoin should not be sent across and not end up in the blockchain.
Currently running a node is for the sake of Bitcoin, but if a significant amount of bandwidth consists of blockchain spamming applications that have nothing to do with Bitcoin then the willingness to run a node might decline rapidly.

Putting every single settlement on the blockchain is not economical and also not necessary. Just like other systems, Bitcoin can settle transactions netted and in bulk using a transaction layer such as the very promising  Lightning network.
Preserving decentralization is crucial and way, way more important than cranking up the number of settlements per second. If decentralization is at a too low level, it can be a sudden end of Bitcoin.

That is to be expected. Bitcoin is much more difficult for authorities to control than the banking system. Therefore Bitcoin will inevitably be used for purposes  that are no longer possible by the banking system.

I would be surprised but then I'd assume he'd do so either to save face or because of other secondary effects that his miners take advantage of and that aren't public.
I don't believe that Jihan will keep on blocking segwit just because he can't get bigger blocks. If he keeps opposing segwit then this must be because activation will lose him money somehow.

I appreciate your reply but you are missing the point I am trying to make.


I know and this is exactly one of the issues. The cost of freebies is hidden because cc companies would be out of business quickly if consumers would have to pay 5% on top of the purchase price for these mostly useless freebees.
I say 5% because even if we assume that cc transaction cost for the merchant is 3%, people without a credit card are also charged 3% and so pay along for the freebies.
Imagine going to a restaurant and being offered the option to pay the bill of USD 100 or instead add the mostly useless freebies (travel insurance... cash back...) and pay USD 105. My guess is that hardly anyone would be interested to buy the add-ons to a dinner in a restaurant. But since the cost are hidden, today *everyone* buys these at *every* purchase, even those done without cc.
This system just sucks - it shouldn't be legal for cc companies to force merchants to hide their transaction costs. I maintain that cc companies are parasites in the true meaning of the word.

Shouldn't there be an explicit list of essential parties such as merchants and exchanges plus an explicit statement for each of whether they support BIP148 and whether they're running a BIP148 node?
And perhaps there should also be a cutoff date where the level of support is measured and a go-nogo decision will be taken, for instance halfway July?
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:34:04
That's an interesting comment. He must be referring to this [Kill-covert-AsicBoost BIP]( which puts a halt to covert AsicBoost.
Jihan can't do anything to stop it so he might as well say he accepts it.
After activation of the BIP, covert AsicBoost is dead. Then, his best option becomes to support segwit which is a blocksize increase meaning more fee income and likely a huge price boost (although however likely is still speculative).
Given that the Kill-covert-AsicBoost BIP is inevitable in the short term (hopefully 0.14.2) Jihan might as well support segwit as of immediate.
Perhaps this tweet is paving the way for him to change his stance on segwit and save some face?
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:15:46


What are these risks? According to BIP148 will happen and there is no going back. Then where is he wrong in his reasoning? How does a scenario where BIP148 does *not* activate look like?

Sadly that definition is plain wrong. Market value and notional are two completely unrelated concepts.
Just consider the example I gave. Notionals are just added up even for trades cancelling eachother out. It is a meaningless number.
As an extreme example but one that hopefully drives home the point, consider the following two-leg swap contract:
On every first business day of the month:
Fixed leg pays 0.0000001% of the notional;
Floating leg receives Libor divided by 1,000,000 over the notional amount.
Now we can set a notional of 1 trillion, but the actual cash flows are tiny.
I can also set the notional at 1 USD and use a multiplier of 1 billion in the contract.
Also, in a portfolio the notionals are just added up even for trades that cancel eachother out and have zero economic value.

Hello redditor for 3 months. A hardfork attempt has a high likelyhood of ending up with two coins. Prime living example is Ethereum which got split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
A softfork on the other hand bears no such risk and are therefore fundamentally different from hardforks.  It is impossible for a softfork to split a coin in two.
So can you please STOP misleading people by saying a softfork can cause a split like a hardfork can? Because  that's simply not true.

The problem is that people stubbornly keep comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin is already superior to VISA *right now* because it can *settle* 3 tps within an hour on average. Compared to VISA *zero*.
Being able to settle within an hour over large distances over communication channels is what makes Bitcoin valuable.
Storing billions of micropayments in the blockchain would not add any value to Bitcoin since effortless micropayments are already possible without Bitcoin. The elaborate infrastructure of Bitcoin which allows a transaction to be settled trustlessly is not necessary for small amounts - it is perfectly acceptable to require some minimal trust for a small value transaction especially in a retail setting.

Nice try to rewrite history. Fact is that Litecoin went up significantly at the exact moment miner support for segwit became sufficient to lock it in.
Other altcoins locking in segwit saw hundreds of percent price increases as well.
Saying that segwit had no effect on price is pure nonsense.
To proof my point, I created a graph showing the [price of LTC relative to Segwit activation]( The price is in green, the blue line is [this segwit activation graph]( which I projected on the [LTC price chart]( but shifted back one day to account for averaging. The relationship is striking.

In a way, this QE money is money that has entered the system *before* the crisis.
Banks overleveraged themselves, creating more money than was responsible, causing the real estate bubble and soaring inflation. Too much money entered the economy.
Instead of taking out that excess money, banks are simply handed the QE money to deleverage them. The price inflation simply preceded the monetary inflation.

That's a fully correct but also purist view.
In practical terms though the OP raises a very valid point. Relying on an uncomfirmed transaction to eventually become confirmed has become more risky.

That is completely pointless. A blockchain is one of the necessary components in Bitcoin which enables it to be trustless. A centralized system does not require a blockchain.
Either banks have absolutely no clue on what Bitcoin truly represents, or they want to make the public believe that they are in the know and plan to take the good parts of Bitcoin (i.e., the Blockchain) while dismissing the bad parts (bitcoin-the-currency). 
Anyone with a bit of a mathematical or software engineering background can read Satoshi's nine page whitepaper and understand that Bitcoin and the blockchain are inseperable and that the notion of "the blockchain" or "fintech" means nothing without bitcoin-the-currency.
Since I guess banks are not dumb and presumably also do not wish to be perceived as dumb, I have a hard time understanding all their clueless blabbering about "blockchain technology" as if it were some kind of new invention that magically creates a whole new branch of finance. In reality, the tech behind  blockchains has existed decades prior to Bitcoin. It is Bitcoin which enabled a new world of finance, one which is radically different from how banks approach it. But perhaps banks just have this urge to be perceived as sexy, trendy and up with the times while by doing so they actually exude an embarrassing amount of technical and financial incompetence that will become painfully clear when it turns out that their homebrew blockchain tech was just talk and zero substance.

It should be no surprise that Bitcoin is not seen as a threat in a country with a healthy economy, max 15% income tax, no VAT and a low government debt.

Your personal suspicion does not make any sense. The block size limit and the limit on the amount of bitcoin are completely unrelated.
One might argue that it would make more economic sense to cap the amount of bitcoin as per immediate and abolish the block reward, effectively stopping the creation of new BTCs in order to increase scarcity in an attempt to increase the value per BTC.
However, such change would be absolutely disastrous for the trust in Bitcoin, crater the price to pennies within days and most likely would eventually mean end the experiment. Such a change would therefore never get adopted.
Even more so for an *increase* in the maximum number of BTC, which would betray current holders of bitcoin in the same way fiat holders are currently being betrayed by quantitative easing and near-zero to negative interest rates.

In the strictest sense, the key difference between money in the banking system and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is trustless. But Bitcoin is only truly trustless if you're running your own node.

Received it as well. Ok, I might as well share my reply:
"Sadly I don't have much time to provide input. However a wallet should be simple and straightforward to use, hide any and all of the technicalities of Bitcoin. At the same time it should be as safe as it possibly can on the platform you are using.
I personally like breadwallet a lot. It comes close to perfect - there are some additional features I'd like to see implemented, but in terms of usability it is outstanding.
The next steps in wallet development IMO are multisig and replacing QR-codes with bluetooth-comms. Security and convenience, indeed.
Ideally, my (2/3) multisig wallet should be compatible with other multisig wallets. So, I sign a transaction on my phone, and my paired multisig wallet sees this and asks confirmation for providing the second signature. Apparently this is currently not possible because there is no easy way of letting the other wallet know that there is a multisig transaction pending. Such change likely requires a BIP - but don't hold back be to write one, this is how innovation continues. The change would involve allowing partly signed multisig transactions to be distributed across nodes, so that your paired wallet can query a node to discover whether a multisig transaction is pending.
Also, again further ahead, the entire concept of an "address" should be abolished for the user. The user should be able to create a number which acts as a bank account, and also works just like regular bank account. I want to be able to give out my Bitcoin account number and receive payments on them, anonymously ofcourse, using stealth techniques. The account number can just be a serial number that is created deterministically from data in the blockchain. This would be a huge improvement as most non-tech people understand bank accounts, but have a hard time getting the counterintuitive concepts of Bitcoin.
Drawing the parallel further, I'd like to see a two-account setup. One account would be for small, daily payments up to a user-specified amount. The cash in my wallet. No multisig. The other account would be my bank account. It would be multisig and be used to top-up my daily use wallet. This should be a standard setup across all wallets, IMO. Standardization, effortless security and predictable behavior is really the key.
One other nicety would be the ability to lock in USD or EUR values of a wallet using derivatives. So, the wallet offers the user to lock in a USD value for his/her bitcoin for a certain time period, and autonomously makes the necessary trades in the background to achieve the lock.
Ok, more input than I intended to write, but hey. Good luck and let me know how it goes."

It is a scaling solution in every sense.

* Lightning Network offers offloading transactions from the settlement layer into a payments layer.
This is the very definition of scaling - enabling more transactions with limited performance degradation.

The energy used by Bitcoin is closely related to the mining reward in fiat currency.
As long as mining is marginally profitable, then this will attract more mining power and therefore increase electricity usage.
Therefore energy usage will surge if the price surges. Reversely - all things being equal, energy usage will more or less halve after the halving of the block reward.

An online smartphone wallet such as breadwallet on iOS has sufficient security for smaller amounts. It can be used for day to day purchases just like you'd use cash out of a classic wallet. To replenish just use a hardware wallet every now and then, just as you would use an ATM.
Then, there are multisig setups that remove reliance on the security of a single wallet. For instance, theoretically it is possible to buy two hardware wallets and store BTC such that both must sign before the BTC can be spent. Both hardware wallets being compromised simultaneously in a way they can steal your money is negligibly small.
The latter setup is not for novices, granted. But likely user experience will improve going forward.

What if fixed denominations were used? So 1,2, 5, 10, 20, 50 ... etc. Then these would be indistinguishable. Also, an address would represent a coin and be used once only. When a coin moves, the address is never again used.
That means addresses can be generated on the fly. A key (HD?) should also be communicated that gives access to a set of addresses (coins) using stealth techniques.

Bitcoin is not a product catering to any customers. Bitcoin is an experiment in computer science and its adoption increasingly challenges long standing economic theories about value, money and the effects of inflation on spending.
Bitcoin is much bigger than you seem to realize. Bitcoin is nothing like an app or website that play any trick in the book just to attract users in order to make money. Bitcoin doesn't advertise - its users have looked at the system and made an informed decision that they wanted to use it. They are free to leave and Bitcoin will still be fine.
The single proposition of Bitcoin is being electronic *peer-to-peer* cash, which means value transfer without any third party involvement using only communication channels, which *demands* being a trustless system, which in turn requires decentralization.
Bitcoin has the best chances to survive in the hands of scientists that resist making popular changes that weaken its proposition and make it more vulnerable to attacks. Treating Bitcoin as a product catering to customers by compromising on its decentralized properties has the biggest potential to destroy its value and make this experiment fail.

That's certainly true, but I'd expect those that trade BTC for a living will be watching the news like a hawk and should act on this immediately and be moving the price.
But perhaps there's not enough professional traders yet for generating such immediate moves.
But if the price remains sub-3000 until after segwit activates then we must conclude that it already had been largely priced in today.

No they don't. As miners will find out, Bitcoin will have segwit even without their approval. Miners can't veto it because they don't have such power.

An occasional message left in the blockchain is not a problem. But building a business around storing data in the blockchain *is* a problem.
Such business would be a constant upward pressure for fees while the profits go into the pockets of the business owner. It is a parasitical use of the blockchain and does not add any value to Bitcoin itself. On the contrary, it is damaging.

If Malaysia withholds part of the salaries these workers are entitled to receive then this money is not truly theirs. This seems a desperate attempt to stimulate their economy over the backs of migrant workers.
This is an example of your hard earned money not actually being yours until it has settled on your bank account and preferably one in a stable and trustworthy jurisdiction at that.
This nicely demonstrates how payments in Bitcoin are far superior as they settle irreversibly and the money can be spent at will without any government or bank being able to interfere, and without risk of losing its value due to debasement of the currency by runaway inflation caused by a corrupt government.

And the reason SPV wallets are so popular is because they do not require to download the entire blockchain which is now 60 GB. Also SPV wallets require only a fraction of the bandwidth compared to a full node.

Such as gold, silver, salt, pepper, coffee (the beans), oil, money. You can't say "one salt" etc. In general, commodities are uncountable.
Are bitcoins cq. is bitcoin countable or uncountable?
Although it seems countable, I have a preference for using "bitcoin" to refer to arbitrary amounts of the currency - meaning literally "Bitcoin based money". The high value of a single BTC pushes it into the uncountable camp for me.
"I will send you some bitcoin"
"I will send you some bitcoins"
"I will send you some bits"
Given the high value of a single BTC, to say that you're sending "some bitcoins" normally doesn't make sense. Bits is better. Sending "some bitcoin" (read: "some Bitcoin based money") seems most natural to me.
This is probably going to be a never ending debate but personally I think there is a lot to say for the commodity lingua which would mean using the word "bitcoin" instead of "bitcoins" when referring to an arbitrary amount of BTC.

If segwit activation signalling is over 50% but below 95% then it will depend on whether miners follow through on BIP91 and orphan all non-segwit signalling blocks.
If so, segwit signalling chain will become the longest. However there's the possibility that BIP91 miners renege BIP91 and decide to just mine on top of a block that does *not* signal for segwit activation. They would act as if BIP91 never happened.
In that case, segwit won't activate because it requires 95% of the blocks to signal it.
This seems to be an unlikely scenario but given the opposition against segwit it cannot be ruled out.
BIP148 nodes might then become the decisive factor when they kick in August 1st and orphan all non-segwit signalling blocks. If segwit signalling is still above 50% then the remaining non-signallers will see their blocks orphaned and they will never be the longest chain. So they have no option but to start signalling as well.
Note that a block that does not signal segwit activation is perfectly valid for most nodes until Aug 1st.
So a transaction can happily get one or by luck even two or three confirmations while mined in a non-segwit signalling block.
This happens if temporarily BIP91 compliant miners are adding blocks more slowly to the tip of the BIP91 compliant chain (so, the one where every block signals for segwit activation) than non-BIP91 miners add blocks to their non-BIP91 chain.
In case some miners continue to mine non-segwit signalling blocks then chain splits will occur. They will resolve because BIP91 has more hash power behind it, but they will happen. Therefore, it is essential to wait for extra confirmations or else verify if a transaction was confirmed by a non-segwit signalling block and wait until it is inevitably invalidated after the segwit-signalling chain overtakes and becomes the longest chain once again.

Bitcoin is under attack with covert AsicBoost exploiting a loophole in producing a PoW. At least, that is my understanding given your motivation for taking the initiative to create the kill-covert BIP.
Covert AsicBoost has a strong centralizing effect. It pushes other miners out and has very likely already given BitMain an unhealthy &gt;50% of all hashpower and without a doubt tens if not hundreds of millions in profits.
This gives deploying either segwit or a fix for covert AsicBoost urgency.
Ongoing attempts to divide the community in order to protect covert AsicBoost are getting unhealthy as well. Likely segwit or the kill-covert BIP can stop the drama.
Congestion and momentum of altcoins give some additional urgency.
EDIT: Price action is also an indicator of where support lies. After you speaking out against BIP148 the price has sunk 10%. This tells me that your influence on the Bitcoin community is big - for good reasons but it seems somewhat uncomfortably centralized.
Also it lays bare that two important core devs  - you and Luke - are in fundamental disagreement which will be perceived as a risk to Bitcoin. A half-assed enforcement of BIP148 can create damage. Would be great if core can come to consensus.

Reasons for "yes":
* As time passes by, more ways to obtain bitcoin become available. Bitcoin ATMs are rapidly deployed, for instance. The lower the treshold will be to get some bitcoin, the more people will participate in the next bubble.
* Bitcoin is constantly in the press, for good or bad. The amount of people that have heard of Bitcoin gradually increases. Once a bubble gets going, these people may buy some bitcoin too.
* Bitcoin is maturing and becoming more secure. Hardware wallets have become available. That may attract a new group of people that previously shunned bitcoin because it was not safe enough for them.
Reasons for "no" (so, there will still be a bubble but not as big as previous ones):
* Bubbles exist only for a short time. Supply will dry up if there is a sudden increase in demand because the price will be skyrocketing. However, history shows that a bubble will of course collapse. That knowledge can increase selling pressure even after a moderate, small price increase.
* The supply of bitcoin through mining, auctions and people willing to sell is preventing any bubble from becoming too high.

In case hashpower suddenly drops significantly and blocks are generated only very slowly then the transaction capacity would also suddenly drop to very low levels.
In such shock-scenario there will be a high demand for transactions which causes the transaction fee to shoot up.
Due to the high fees, rhe block reward will be elevated as well which should in turn draw extra mining power.
Even if the value of BTC had dropped, the higher block reward would incite miners to point their rigs at Bitcoin again. That in turn would accelerate the block generation time back to acceptable levels.

Even with supporting a maximum of 3 *settlements* per second, Bitcoin already has genuine, real world application.
VISA may support 10,000 transactions per second, but it settles these in bulk and a merchant can typically only access his funds after three business days. By contrast, Bitcoin settles every individual transaction within about an hour and the money is readily available for spending to the receiver.
It is not required to eternally record every coffee purchase on the blockchain. The Lightning network is a promising solution for deferred bulk settlements that will still blow VISA out of the water.

I find it daring to assume Moore's "law" will hold up another 20 years. Also, I don't understand what the benefits are of increasing the block size limit faster than is very likely to be necessary. Isn't this just going to encourage Bitcoin-alien "Bitcoin 2.0" (*sic*) applications to spam the blockchain?
The notion that the block size limit has to be increased in a predictable way and such that it needs to be implemented only once is undisputably sound, however I would have been in favor of a more modest block size growth for the three reasons given above (i.e., does Moore's law hold up? Is such a large block size necessary? Won't it attract blockchain spam?).

Not at all. You seem not to be understanding the model. Most volunteering open source developers do not take much pleasure in ungrateful users that boss them around. Instead, they have an idea, a vision. It is gratifying to build something according to such a vision and see users adopt your software, subscribing to the same vision.
Unlike a software company, an open source dev cares first about their vision, next about their users. A software company creating a product and wanting to sell as many copies as possible cares firstly about their users, then about their vision, if any.


On the contrary. Open source devs sticking with a vision will very much have a direction, possibly at the sacrifice of some of the user base. This is taken for granted as there is only a vision to defend, not a profit statement.
Products being developed without any vision however will sooner or later become obsolete.

But amongst *existing* Bitcoiners, we *witness* that the number of people willing to run a full node is declining. Despite increasing adoption. So that is *evidence* that increased adoption is *not* curbing the trend in which the number of nodes is declining.
You are just *speculating* that if only the number of new Bitcoiners is large enough, the number of full nodes will stop decreasing and even will increase.
However you do not present any *evidence* to support your case. But let me help you out. Evidence would for instance be showing that for every 1000 new Bitcoin users there is one that will run a full node, and that the number of new Bitcoin users has to grow with a feasible amount to curb the trend.
However the fraction of Bitcoiners running a full node will drop if adoption increases. This is because to attract a large number of new users, Bitcoin has to become easier to use so that also less tech savvy users can get started. But these new and less tech savvy Bitcoiners be less likely to run a full node. In other words - if mass adoption happens, it is likely that only a small fraction will be running a full node.
Therefore I do not think mass adoption will significantly raise the number of nodes. I have presented compelling arguments for my case. You on the other hand did nothing but speculating and wishful thinking.

Yes to be clear I was just expressing my surprise at the price not moving much upon the news of BIP91 possibly moving into Core. IMO that's a big event because it guarantees segwit activation, obsoletes BIP148 and avoids chainsplits. In short, it would end the drama completely.

Yes, once the consensus changing rules in Segwit2x become active, miners supporting Segwit2x will start producing blocks that are no longer valid according to the nodes running Bitcoin Core.
From that point forward there will be two blockchains. One is the Bitcoin Core chain that simply ignores any incompatible Segwit2x block and the other chain is the one upheld by nodes running the Segwit2x code instead of Bitcoin Core. These nodes consider the Segwit2x blocks to be valid.
The litmus test of economic support will be in the price in the market of bitcoin on either chain. It is generally predicted that Segwit2x bitcoin will have a near-zero value.

That said - a next bubble is likely to happen as the supply is finite and Bitcoin is slowly proliferating across the world. The question is what will trigger it. It might be Wall Street entering the scene, it might be the ETFs which are on its way, it might be a next financial crisis, or the next halving causing the number of new BTCs to be issued daily to halve.

Well if they reject non-BIP91 blocks that are perfectly valid for nodes, isn't that effectively a miner enforced softfork?
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:42:22
~~Canoe is the only pool to have mined a non-segwit signalling block recently.~~ It will be interesting to see what happens if they mine one now that BIP91 has been activated.
If ~~Canoe~~ some miner mines a non-BIP91 block, then nodes will see it as perfectly valid. Miners that honor BIP91 will not be mining on top of it. As soon as the BIP91 chain catches up, the non-BIP91 block will be orphaned.
This creates an interesting situation. From a nodes point of view, the non-BIP91 block is perfectly valid and the miners just colluded in a 51% attack to orphan it. This sets the unsettling precedent where miners unilaterally force Bitcoin into doing a softfork by orphaning a valid block. Miners are tightening the rules further relative to nodes.
A softfork can be powerful. Segwit and the increase to 2 MB blocks is a softfork. Will miners wake up to this idea, smell the power and create for instance a big block softfork? I don't know if it's possible so my question is genuine.
EDIT Canoe is signalling segwit as well now.

Miners don't decide the Bitcoin consensus rules. It's the nodes that do. If a miner produces a block that doesn't obey the consensus rules as enforced by nodes, then their block will be ignored by nodes. It will be as if the block never existed. The mining power expended is all for naught.
The success of Segwit2x depends on whether nodes are willing to accept their blocks. Already we know now that nodes running the software as created by the Core devs will *not* adopt the Segwit2x consensus rule changes. So, from a Bitcoin Core perspective a Segwit2x block is invalid and will be ignored. We also know that the economic players in Bitcoin as well as most users will stick with Core.
The obvious lack of support for Segwit2x makes this all an exercise in futility that is increasingly entertaining to watch. Jeff Garzik et al have dug themselves into a massive hole and I can't wait to see the gymnastics performed trying to escape it. I have my popcorn ready!

That proofs that some information existed no later than a certain point in time.
It is however impossible to proof that some piece of information did *not* exist prior to a certain point in time.
Edit: ok who downvoted? It is a fundamental property of information. If you think it is possible to proof that *any bit of information* did not exist prior to some point in time, then please explain how.
You might argue that it is possible to proof that a nonce of the latest block could not have existed earlier. That is true, but a nonce is random and holds no information itself. It does not qualify as information. It is merely derived from information (the contents of a block).

That's a fun one. Here's one of the most plausible explanations that I can think of.
In 2008, CW had been abducted by aliens who locked him up and hypnotized him for a period of three years and brought him into a mentally elevated state during which his logic reasoning abilities were activated and his IQ was doubled to 140. During this time CW invented and worked on Bitcoin.
After being released and snapping out of hypnosis CWs IQ went back to 70 and although he remembers being the inventor of Bitcoin, he now tragically fails to properly understand his own invention and has no recollection of any aliens or hypnosis.
The episodes of rage and use of profanities when trying to explain anything technical are manifestations of a deep frustration of knowing to be Satoshi but failing to grasp his own invention.

What is the relationship between payment channels and sidechains?
One application of sidechains is offloading the main blockchain. I always considered that sidechains are great for this. For instance, a contract (such as a CFD) exists for a limited time but has a constant series of cash flows between the parties that entered the contract. If these flows could be offloaded to a sidechain, then that would save space on the blockchain. As a bonus, specific functionality to support these class of contracts (having a prespecified start and end time) could be implemented on the sidechain.
However, it seems to me that payment channels might also implement such contracts, also offloading the blockchain. That means one less use case for sidechains.
Also, I am wondering how reorgs and sidechains can be reconciled. If you ask me, that will be a big can of worms.

Yep, xbt.eu now reports 249 out of 312 blocks needed for lock-in, or 79.8%. This means that if 79.8% of hashpower signals BIP91 then the chance of lock-in stands at 50% for the current period.

How to proof that the letter did not already exist earlier, and that the blockchain hash wasn't inserted much later?
It is **impossible** to proof that any information (letter, picture, video, ...) did not exist prior to a specific point in time. It can not be proofed that information was not manipulated to make it look like as if it could not have existed at an earlier point in time.
For instance, a video of a hostage who is alive with a todays newspaper next to him is a strong indication that the hostage was still alive when the newspaper appeared, however it is not a *proof*. There is no way to proof that the video has not been edited. The original recording could have been using an older newspaper, which was then replaced frame-by-frame with an image of a more recent newspaper.

Fact is that 1 BTC is valued US$ 2,580. That is very real. Also, Bitcoin has been around for over 8 years. That is quite a long existence and also strongly suggests Bitcoin is real.

How to do that? Make a payment from the altchain to my address? This transaction won't exist on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Then, create a transaction that spends my coins plus the altchain coins? That would succeed on the altchain but not on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Is this what you mean?
EDIT ah wait.
EDIT2: clearer explanation.
1. Buy altcoins to create an altcoin address on the altchain.
2. Create a transaction that sends original bitcoin *plus* altcoin to some new altcoin address controlled by me.
That should result in my bitcoin not moving on the Bitcoin blockchain, since the altcoin don't exist there which makes the transaction invalid.
However both my original bitcoin and my new altcoin exist on the altchain so the transaction is valid to the altcoin nodes. So on the altchain my original bitcoin plus my newly purchased altcoin move to the new address on the altchain.
That results in coins on both chains.

But try as I might to think of ways in which fiat can survive, I can't seem to find any.
It kind of creates a paradox in the mind where the conviction grows that big changes are coming while at the same time it is almost inconceivable that the longstanding fiat status quo can be obliterated.

The post in full below.
Someone sent me a copy of the Barry Silbert agreement, an agreement forged between a select number of participants 
Participants agree to immediately activate Segwit, however, under a different activation proposal. Since I have spent the last few months researching various activation strategies of the current BIP141 deployment, as well as redeployment, I feel I am quite well placed to comment on the technicalities.
To be clear, the proposal as far as I can see does not activate BIP141, but is a completely new deployment which would be incompatible with the BIP141 deployment. I'm not sure how that can be considered "immediate" activation. Surely immediate activation would just be for miners to start signalling and segwit would be activated in 4-5 weeks. The proposal seems to require a lower 80% threshold, I assume because they were unable to convince 95% of the hashpower to go trigger activation.
There are a few options to activating segwit now, the first being for 95% of hashrate to signal. The second is for the community to deploy BIP148 UASF which will force miners to signal segwit. Being a UASF it is date triggered. The third option is a redeployment of segwit on a new bit, but requires waiting for the existing deployment to time out, because all the p2p messages and service bits related to segwit must be replaced too (which is what BIP149 does).
A fourth option, first suggested to me by James Hilliard, was to make BIP148 miner triggered (MASF) with a lower threshold, above 50%. I coded this up a few weeks ago  but didnt get around to posting to the ML yet. This effectively lowers the threshold from 95% to 65% as coded, or could be upped to 80% or whatever was preferable.
I think this removes the primary risk of BIP148 causing the creation of two chains, and gives an improved chance to get segwit activated quickly (assuming a majority of miners wish to go this route). But hash a primary disadvantage of still leaving the activation in the hands of miners. If it doesn't work out, then BIP149 can then be used as proposed, but it'll be even safer because we'll have futher guaged support.
SEGSIGNAL: 
BIP148: 
BIP149: 
I think the Barry Silbert agreement is very ill considered, and clearly lacking peer review from the technical community. Suggestions of a HF in 4 months are completely unrealistic and without technical merits. But more importantly, closed door agreements between selected participants is not how to garner consensus to change a $30bn decentralized system. The purpose of my email is to try and assist in the "immediate activation of segwit" which only requires hashrate to participate; and to provide some techincal input since I have done a great deal of research and development into the topic.
Given the history we've already passed the point where we should be expecting miners to cooperate in lowering their own fee income with a capacity increase; but we should be open to all reasonable options in the interest in moving things forward in a safe and collaborative way.

I can't understand his reasoning at all.
For instance, suppose that some company offers to store data on the blockchain and successfully markets it. So successful indeed that companies offer to pay high fees for their service. As a consequence this would drive up the price for a normal transaction as space on the blockchain is scarce.
The company is making a profit out of their repurposing of the scarce space on the blockchain, while at the same time transaction fees are now $10.
Now imagine not one, but ten companies finding some business model based on storing stuff on the "eternal, immutable blockchain".
I find it hard to argue that this would be all fair game just because they paid the transaction fees. Bitcoin would be dead by then.

Shock and horror. Some devs are more influential to Bitcoin than others. Yes, not all devs contribute to Bitcoin equally. So?


As you yourself indicate, if Wladimir turns out to be corrupted, a new repo can easily be created. Every dev has a local copy of the entire repo.


How is that a bad thing? Their contributions have been very important. Not to underestimate Luke, but Gregs' contributions to Bitcoin have been immense. People respect their views because Greg and Luke do a great job advocating their viewpoints. Not just with their peers but also to the public here on Reddit and other boards.


I am not sure what you're suggesting here but the devs don't control Reddit or other public discussion boards. Anyone can write anything as long as they adhere to the rules of the particular discussion board or else they'll be *moderated* which is not censorship. In fact, moderation is very necessary or else r/bitcoin would have looked like r/btc right now, a place owned by Roger Ver where liars and shills spread misinformation with full support of their mods. In that light, moderation is actually an anti-censorship measure because it restricts small groups with ill-supported views from flooding a board with their misinformation using sock puppets and derail any discussion, effectively making the board useless and driving out others, which is the kind of censorship that moderation prevents.


No it does not. Segwit will eventually be activated as you yourself concede, so miners have been able to stall segwit but they can't stop it.
*Some* miners are able to stall activation because of the activation mechanism which assumed cooperative miners as segwit has overwhelming support with devs and the rest of the Bitcoin community. The activation mechanism allowed miners to decide when the change would be activated so they have the chance to update their code. No one expected some large miner to abuse this courtesy to stall this incontroversial change. For future softforks the activation mechanism has changed such that miners won't be able to stall it again.

I see, and agreed.
I just pointed out the that perhaps there should also be a transaction type which cannot be RBF-ed so that users cq. walllets can chose what to use.
Thinking of it, I guess the ideal situation is to have Bitcoin support two kinds of RBF-able transactions: the current Peter Todd variant and one that can be added a fee to but not change anything else by means of sending an additional special "amendment" transaction that anyone - also the receiver - can send.

No it does not. Miners indeed get to decide something: which transactions go into a block. But they don't get to decide whether a transaction is valid. This is a task for nodes.
Note also that in the beginning, all nodes were mining and being a node was synonymous to being a miner. The whitepaper may not always have made the distinction in a clear cut way.

Perhaps it makes sense to separate the software upgrade event and the upgrade activation event.
So, first, nodes and other software upgrades to a new version which has implemented the new consensus rules but do not active the new rules yet.
Only after a prespecified condition is met, the new rules are activated.
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:10:25
That would mean relying on being lucky enough to realize your mistake before a block is found which includes your transaction, which can be anything from hours, minutes but also mere seconds after sending it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:02:38
Cool! This seals the fate for segwit activation. The version will likely be 0.14.2-segsignal.
Miners won't be able to renege after this change. BIP91 will be enforced by 0.14.2-segsignal nodes meaning that blocks that don't signal segwit after BIP91 activation will be rejected.
As a result, 0.14.2-segsignal nodes will be ignoring transactions in non-BIP91 blocks, avoiding that these transactions temporarily are regarded to have one confirmation and potentially even two or more. Anyone receiving payments should definitely upgrade to avoid seeing these bogus confirmations.
EDIT: not 0.14.2.1 but 0.14.2-segsignal.

Bitcoin *is* being increasingly widely used as a currency. It is just expensive to do an on-chain payment.
Also, making a payment isn't the main use of a currency. Fiat is mainly used as a temporary store of value that people are being forced to use by their governments. I presume you receive your tax-payer financed salary from the state in BRL on a bank account and you pay your taxes in BRL as well. So you are being *forced* to use fiat as a store of value by your own government.


Bitcoin is very volatile compared to most fiat currencies although I wouldn't mind getting a salary fixed in BTC which is exactly what Blockstream is doing.


That highlights two major problems: the fact that fiat is a failure as a store of wealth and secondly that using the bank system means having every transaction monitored and potentially meddled with by the bank or government. Bitcoin solves both these problems.


Cherry picking timeframes doesn't deny the fact that as a long term store of value or Bitcoin has outperformed every single asset class. Storing some wealth into Bitcoin paid off handsomely for those who were patient.


You just can't wrap your head around the fact that a digital token that is intangible can have any value. But it undeniably has, US$ 2677 per BTC on Bitstamp at the time I write this.

I'll give you that values of goods fluctuate a bit relative to eachother, albeit much less than you paint it.
It has nothing to do with our discussion. Relative fluctuations in value is a completely separate issue from loss of value due to inflation. If I am compensated with a sum of money which buys me a brand new mid-range car or a years worth of groceries today, but only a 10-year old low end rundown car or 1 month of groceries in twenty years, then clearly value hasn't been preserved.

A commodity is not restricted to solely being a real, consumable good.
Commodities are heavily speculated upon. Traded commodities have hedgers, arbitrators and speculators just like any other traded instrument. A speculative commodity with little purpose other than wealth preservation and a hedge against fiat is gold.


In which way does the production of a gold bar produce new wealth? What makes gold any different from Bitcoin? It has little real world value (granted it does have some industrial uses) - it's value is in large part given by its scarceness.

These obviously aren't laws of nature and never pretended to be. They're more like observations and it has always been clear to anyone with the slightest grasp of physics that these "laws" had to break at some point.
Exponential growth never continues forever - laws of physics will *always* prevent it. In the case of Moore and Nielsen the limit is the size of atoms. The closer this limit is being approached, the harder it becomes to make circuits smaller up to a point where it becomes impossible.

Most data is already stored redundantly. Storing it in a blockchain which gets copied thousands of times is overkill IMO.
Personally, I'd like to see a Bitcoin based communications and storage protocol where the level of redundancy is a parameter. In such network, nodes storing data would be rewarded in bitcoin. I suppose it is a bit like Maidsafe / Storj although I have not looked into them in depth. But for me the only feasible solution is parametrized, Bitcoin based storage and bandwidth, peer to peer, decentralized and of course encrypted.

For a system to be trustless, the tokens must be carrying all value. If a token is of negligible value but represents an asset of substantial value, then the system is no longer trustless.
After all, owning such token means having to trust that the asset actually exists, truly has the value which the token claims it has, and ownership through owning a token is legally enforceable.
That is a lot of trust required. Bitcoin is trustless, but tokens representing assets are not and have not much added value.

That's not going to happen. The economics of Bitcoin do not allow it. The cost to mine bitcoin is related to its reward.
If you were able to mine bitcoin and make a profit, then likely so do many others who pay the same for their electricity as you. Therefore, some of them will also buy hashing power and compete with you, and by doing so they drive up the difficulty and with that cost of mining bitcoin.
Worse, you will also have to compete with hashers which have access to subsidized or even free electricity. These hashers will only have to earn back their investment in hardware and will be able to invest in tremendous amounts of hashing power. By doing so, the difficulty will become so high that anyone having to pay consumer level prices for electricity will no longer be able to mine profitably.

There is no support for at all for the reckless hardfork as planned by Segwit2x.
* Doing a hardfork is reckless in the first place;
* The changes jeopardize the single most important property of Bitcoin: being trustless. Increasing the blocksize to Segwit2x levels has centralizing effects - for instance less people will be able to run a node due to the heavy bandwidth demands. A centralized Bitcoin is no longer trustless and wouldn't be of any value.
* The team that created Segwit2x has demonstrated poor understanding of the current codebase. Only after it was explicitly pointed out to them thanks to a comment on reddit by they were able to correctly implement a blocksize increase. The credibility of the Segwit2x team is low while that of the Bitcoin Core devs can't be higher as most have been working on the codebase for almost as long as Bitcoin exists.
Therefore your conclusion in your last paragraph is spot on. The economic value of the bitcoin in the Segwit2x chain will be low. Miners have bills to pay so they will be forced to come back and mine on the Bitcoin Core blockchain to stay in business.

I agree. What's more: no sane person would keep any savings in a heavily inflating currency. In fact, since all fiat currencies inflate and therefore decrease in value significantly per each decade, fiat currency is sadly unsuitable as a long-term wealth preserving instrument.
As a result, people are forced look at alternative avenues to preserve their wealth.


I agree again. However, the downside of utilizing such instruments for mere wealth preservation is that it carries a significant risk of losing some or even all wealth. Funds can lose money, counterparties can default, real estate prices are susceptible to bubbles.
Ideally, preserving wealth would be completely risk free. Ideally, there would be a ways to preserve wealth for 20 years without having sleepless nights. If only there was an instrument that allowed for storing wealth without having to resort to risk-taking and speculation. Unfortunately such instrument does not really seem to exist.
Fiat currency would be pretty much the perfect wealth preserving instrument if it wasn't for that nasty tendency of ever losing value through inflation. Sadly governments have the perverse incentive to take on debt and subsequently inflate some of it away. (And a government has the power to inflate its currency before the market has had any chance to price it in - these practices are no different and at least as despicable as frontrunning and insider trading. Sell debt, then pay back by creating most of the nominal worth out of thin air, saddling creditors with losses and punishing savers with inflation).
Gold may be a better alternative. At least it is not governed - it cannot be artificially inflated at a whim.
Coming back to Bitcoin now. It has been designed to be an a-political money that is not governed by any one group or country. It is an amazing feat and it runs counter to intuition. After all, how can a software that anyone can change enforce any of its crucial properties? Understandably, in another post in this thread you wonder: how can Bitcoin guarantee its 21 mio BTC cap in the number of coins? A few lines changed in the code and boom - it is 21 bn! Bitcoin has demonstrated for over 7 year that this is indeed possible  - it is a CS breakthrough no less!
Now assume for the sake of argument that the science behind Bitcoin is sound and a BTC indeed is forever as scarce as it was set out to be from the start. Wouldn't that make Bitcoin like land, real estate and gold? And the BTC a scarce token perfectly suitable for storing wealth?

That situation will be unsustainable. The amount of money miners spend on mining power is roughly proportional to the mining reward (the 12.5 BTC coinbase reward plus a couple BTC in fees per block) in fiat terms. That is because miners must cover their expenses using this reward.
Some altchain with a low-value token will not attract much mining power because of the low reward in fiat terms. Electricity bills, mining facilities, rigs and staff have all to be paid for using the reward.

There is currently no way to even approximate a fair value for a BTC. The volatility tells you as much.
Investing in BTC is a leap of faith. It means believing the price will increase further even after the recent more than doubling of the price.
Perhaps the best way to approximate a future price is to identify all major possible future events, their chances of happening and an estimation on the effects of each event on the price.
For instance, events for the coming 12 months:
* Increased adoption: 80% chance, 50% price increase.
* Bitcoin ETF is approved: 20% chance, 500% price increase
* Owning and trading Bitcoin declared illegal in the USA: 5% chance, 75% price decrease
* Split between developers causing a hardfork: 1% chance, 90% decrease
* Major exchange fails: 20% chance, 40% decrease
And so on. Adjust numbers according to your believes. Then do the math and a price will roll out.

What about applications that store data in the blockchain with transactions of tiny value? Miners have an incentive to accept them as long as a transaction fee is included.
However, it forces nodes to store more data (although this will be alleviated by pruning) and use more bandwidth, just to also support random applications that have nothing to do with bitcoin-the-currency, and for which often only a tiny user base exists.
Wouldn't larger blocks hold the danger that more nodes stop supporting Bitcoin because of the increased bandwidth requirements for supporting mostly bitcoin-alien applications?

Adam Back comments on the often made comparison between Bitcoin and the World Wide Web. He argues that the two are fundamentally different in that HTML was able to evolve quickly, whilst Bitcoin cannot because it needs consensus - every node must work using the same rules.
However, just like HTTP is the underlying protocol used to transfer web pages, Bitcoin is the protocol used to transfer value. HTML is what evolved quickly - it is the level on which applications are built. Similarly, the applications built on top of the protocol are also evolving quickly (payments, remittances, timestamping).
I'd therefore argue that Bitcoin is better compared with HTTP, and not with HTML.

Fiat currency are being inflated by central banks and handed out to banks and governments for free. This is monetary inflation. 
Trilllions were created out of thin air during quantitative easings. This money has been stolen from:

* Savers by inevitable price inflation;
* Smaller companies with limited access to credit that lose out relative to larger corporations that banks lend their free money to for near zero interest rates.

Miners shouldn't have *any* say at all in the Bitcoin protocol. Miners have only one job: produce a block and offer it for validation to nodes. If the block follows the rules of the protocol then the nodes will accept the block and the miner gets their reward.
The data that miners are allowed to stuff in a block is governed by the protocol and validated by nodes. Miners have some wiggle room but nodes can tighten the rules if miners misbehave.
The incentives of miners are sadly not perfectly aligned with that of the bigger Bitcoin ecosystem. Especially now with AsicBoost, the interests of ASIC manufacturers that use the AsicBoost loophole abuse their power to block SegWit. That power was inadvertently given to miners by asking them to signal readiness for segwit. This was purely intended as a courtesy to miners and definitely not as a request for their approval.

No, don't worry. Your pre-Aug 1st coins will be unaffected until you spend. During the time that there is a chain split, your old coins exist on both chains, so you have both 148Coin and LegacyCoin.
When spending at a time when there is an unresolved chainsplit (so both 148Coin and LegacyCoin co-exist) then nodes of both coins would see the transaction and miners of both chains would mine it. Effectively your Bitcoin will continue to exist on both chains.
My scenario is one where someone maliciously splits their coins such that they can send someone a payment that exists on the LegacyCoin chain but not on the 148Coin chain. Then, in case the LegacyCoin chain is destroyed due to a reorg, the payee will find out that the payment does not exist on the 148Coin chain and that effectively they have not been paid at all.

Maybe you refer to Satoshi saying that multiple implementations of the consensus rules would be “a menace to the network”. This is because consensus rules must be implemented exactly identically across implementations, including bugs. If not, spontaneous forks will occur after which it will be unclear which implementation is correct and which one is wrong. This would be chaos for the time during which it is unclear which chain is to be considered Bitcoin.

You misunderstood. Jihan already has veto power over Segwit and sadly this BIP won't be able to change it.
The activation method of SegWit was a miscalculation. At the time it was implemented no one accounted for the possibility that some
miners would veto activation of a feature like Segwit that greatly enhanced the protocol.
But now we're in this situation where 5% of the hashpower has veto power. That puts any miner having more in the position to sabotage segwit and by effectively any Bitcoin improvements.
This BIP helps to alleviate this by increasing the haspower required for a veto to 35%. Small (&lt; 5% hashpower) miners will no longer be able to block activation of SegWit, however Jihan *still* can.

Allowing bigger blocks has the undisputed side effect of requiring significantly more bandwidth for full nodes. The decentralized properties of Bitcoin are upheld by these full nodes. Their numbers have been on a steady decline making Bitcoin increasingly centralized. Increasing the block size maximum will increase the bandwidth requirements and thus cost to run a full node considerably, which is another disincentive to run a full node.
If the number of full nodes declines too far, Bitcoin will start to lose its one and only property that gives it value: being trustless. Loss of too many nodes could well put Bitcoin into a spiral of declining confidence, decreasing price, decreasing node count, declining confidence, ... and repeat until it's dead.
I find it rather immature to accuse people who don't agree with you of having an agenda.

Any privacy enhancing BIP is a huge boon for the fungibility of Bitcoin. Seeing that Greg Maxwell has been allowed to give feedback is promising as well.
"After receiving a Dandelion transaction, the node flips a biased coin to determine whether to propagate it in “stem mode”, or to switch to “fluff mode.” The bias is controlled by a parameter exposed to the command line, initially 90% chance of staying in stem mode (meaning the expected stem length would be 10 hops)."

A blockchain having the above features can only exist in a decentralized, trustless fashion if it carries a token having a monetary value. In case a blockchain does not issue any monetary value then it must be governed centrally to some degree and will require a level of trust between parties because the blockchain will be susceptible to tampering.
If there is no PoW, a bank or colluding banks can tamper with the blockchain and rewrite the transaction history at will. Nothing would stop a bank or colluding banks to create an alternate blockchain by recalculating alternate blocks from any point in the past and thus force it to be the valid transaction history.
The tamper-proof property of monetary token bearing blockchains such as Bitcoin is a result of the inability of any single party to force the network to rewind transactions. Transactions can be cancelled by forcing the discarding of previously generated blocks and creating alternative blocks containing alternative transactions in their place. Doing as such is only possible by a single party that controls over 50% of all hash power due to PoW.
As soon as any trust between parties is required, a blockchain stops making any sense as a ledger and a central database would be much more cost efficient.

Why not simply specify a blockheight that has already been mined by the longer legacy chain but not yet by the BIP148 chain? Wouldn't that be less risky? The transaction would be invalid for the legacy chain and the bitcoin would end up being moved on the BIP148 chain only, resulting in a split.

It is pretty obvious that classic developers sorely lack in the talent department, which is why no one is prepared to fund them.
Given their lack of talent and the miserable failure that is Classic, can't see any reason to take their side in the blocksize debate. For some reason I feel more inclined to side with the Core devs who are on the forefront of cryptography and understand the science behind Bitcoin and are doing an amazing job of demonstrably advancing a 10 bn currency.
The no-talent Classic developers have shown not to be capable of anything but spreading misinformation and launch personal attacks at Core devs and Blockstream staff.

If I understand correctly, then this BIP lowers the SegWit lock-in percentage to 65% from 95%.
Segwit signalling is currently hovering around 30% and I believe it is save to assume that BitMain (Jihan) controls more than 35% of all hashpower.
What it does change is that in the event that Jihan changes his mind and signals for SegWit then it definitely activate. Without this BIP, someone with 5% of the hashpower would still be able to block activation.
In short, this BIP puts full responsibility in the shoes of Jihan.

It is debatable whether mining is an actual net cost. After all, miners are compensated with Bitcoin and normally make a profit.
The cost is fully offset by the value that is created - securing of the Bitcoin network. The bills of the miners are paid by the Bitcoin network in BTC.
Fiat money spent by anyone to buy BTC inflates the amount of fiat available to people outside the BTC economy, resulting in a tiny devaluation of all fiat. So ultimately, all holders of fiat together pay the miners' bills.
Taking this to its ultimate conclusion, a situation may arise in the far future where people buying BTC start to inflate the fiat amounts notably such that it starts to cause price inflation, causing more people to want BTC, reinforcing the cycle. It'd be the end of fiat.

But who is the actual fool remains to be seen - so far I have a lot of faith in free markets and their ability to adequately valuate. Calling the market wrong in the case of gold requires a lot of balls. Reasoning that it is because the value of gold should be tied to its value when used other than sitting idle in a bank vault is daring. In fact, you are saying that gold in a vault serves no value. It sets you apart from most other economists, that's for sure.

The PoW implementation needs some serious rethinking.
PoW is inherently centralizing hashpower and I can't see any way to avoid a self-mining ASIC manufacturer from obtaining uncomfortable amounts of hashpower.
The only remedy I see is to force identification of the manufacturer whose ASIC created a block. This offers the ability to brick the equipment of a specific manufacturer through a simple softfork. That power will be an effective threat against any self-mining manufacturer that is willing to abuse their hashpower.

Hardware wallets have the highest security.
Bitcoin Core itself tries everything to be safe. However a PC is vulnerable to viruses and hacks which Bitcoin Core cannot defend itself against.
A phone and especially an iPhone is very hard to hack. Using a safe wallet such as breadwallet increases security even further.
The safest option is a hardware wallet which cannot be hacked at all. Trezor is a good choice.
Make sure you can recover your bitcoin in case you lose the device that stores them. Most wallets let you write down 12 to 24 words that represent your bitcoin. This is called a "seed". Do *never* store your seed on a computer - the seed is literally your bitcoin. Write it down with pen and paper and store it somewhere safe.

So let me get this straight. It's August 1st. A user relying on their Bitcoin software that they downloaded from bitcoin.org sees some large payment coming in and after it confirms, delivers the goods.
Some hours later their BTC are reorged away and after downloading updated Bitcoin software, the payment turns out not to exist on the BIP148 chain.
Now your explanation is: "oh sorry for your loss, but Bitcoin was temporarily broken, you should have downloaded some BIP148 compliant software from some other website."
I'm sure you realize how bad that stains the reputation of bitcoin.org software that many users blindly rely on. It sets a precedent where apparently Bitcoin can just stop working randomly even when using bitcoin.org software and users are forced to run alternative software from some website that they may never have heard of to solve some issue they might have been totally oblivious to. Because PSA: Reddit cq. r/bitcoin only reaches a fraction of all Bitcoin users.
The worst is that it sets the stage where nefarious changes can be pushed through using just sentiment.

"It's the easiest and most reliable way to scale"
Centralizing issues that would have jeopardized the existence of Bitcoin that lends most of its value from being trustless. It would also have opened up an attack where verifying a block would take excessive amounts of time because the validation time rises *quadratically* with the size of a block.
 "there was nothing stopping them from implementing multiple solutions at the same time"
The issues above as well as working on better improvements than a blunt blocksize increase.
"that was the agreed upon approach for a while"
It was not. Perhaps you're referring to the HK agreement (which miners broke) where it was never agreed by Core to first increase the blocksize.
"Most of those scaling enhancements work best with a hard fork"
Segwit works fine with a softfork. BitMain pushes for a hardforked implementation likely because that method retains their unfair AsicBoost advantage over other miners.
"a larger block size would mean that Gavin was right too, which was unacceptable to their ego."
No it would not. Besides, Gavin advocated 20 MB blocks saying that he did the calculations and concluded that it was safe. Later he had to backtrack on that because his calculations were wrong.
 "If they really wanted to implement their scaling tech, they could have by now"
What "scaling tech"? Bluntly increasing block size is not scaling. Allowing for orders of magnitudes increases in transaction capacity with just a doubling of the blocksize is real scaling and LN can do that.

Any HF will just create another altcoin regardless of initial hashpower and will trade for no more than 1/10th of the price of BTC.
Come to think of it - if Jihan points even half his hashpower at his fork, then SegWit activating hashpower may jump from 30% to above the 65% that is required for activation (assuming the [latest proposal by James Hilliard]( makes it).

What about people running a node using Bitcoin Core downloaded from bitcoin.org and which is the most widely used software? They will think they're all good.
But these users will remain on the legacy chain and any payments they receive after Aug 1st will be reorged away if BIP148 wins, saddling them with losses.
How can you explain to them that they should have run some alternative software with "BIP148" instead? And in the event BIP148 succeeds, won't this set a dangerous precedent and won't it encourage future populists tactics to entice switching to a non-Core client with possibly more nefarious changes?

I don't understand how it would be bad to have a single platform where consensus emerges.
Core is a heterogeneous group of people that can be joined and left freely. Anyone making a useful contribution to Core gets a fair review and feedback from other contributors. They are the experts with most experience and thankfully they meticulously review every proposed change. It is a platform on which consensus is to be reached for any change to be accepted.
Breaking this monopoly would mean that a second independent group is going to also review and accept changes. That's not workable. Consensus changes that are not acceptable to Bitcoin Core are going to cause disruptive chainsplits. There would no longer be a single group forming consensus over changes to Bitcoin. Users will be on their own in judging whether to adopt new changes that are not supported by Core. It invites abuse where users are tricked into accepting nefarious non-Core changes.
One of the strong points of Bitcoin is its governance model. Messing with it is in and of itself already a change so big that it would irreparably damage trust.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:50:12


Nope, it does not. Miners do not have any power over the Bitcoin protocol. Miners assemble the blocks and merely offer it to nodes for validation. It's *nodes* that verify whether each block has been created according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. If it was not, then the block will be rejected and the miner does not receive any reward.
Hash rate only matters for the miner income, which is more or less proportional to its hash rate. When it comes to decisions on how the Bitcoin protocol has to function, hash power has no vote at all.
The misinformation you are spreading which is that miners rule over the Bitcoin protocol has its origins in the way SegWit was designed to activate. To minimize possible disruption of the network, the activation of SegWit waits until 95% of all miners signal they are ready to make the switch. The assumption was that due to the overwhelming support for SegWit, miners would signal as soon they had adapted their software for SegWit.
However, things did not go as expected and instead only about 30% of all hash power currently signals readiness for SegWit. The reasons we all know:
* Centralization of mining power which has allowed a single ASIC manufacturer to control more than half of all hash power;
* AsicBoost, which gives this manufacturer an unfair advantage over other miners;
* The fact that SegWit eliminates the possibility to use AsicBoost covertly.
The stakes are high - according to estimates, the AsicBoost advantage that BitMain enjoys can make them about USD 100 million a year in profits. Even if it were half this amount, such huge sums of money on the line goes a long way in explaining a lot of the drama we're seeing currently such as of companies such as BitPay being in the pocket of BitMain, the amount of astroturfing on social media and sudden alternate proposals that all remarkably preserved the possibility to secretly use AsicBoost.
The latest talking point seems to be that miners set the rules of Bitcoin by means of their hashing power which is completely false. I hope that this is clear now.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:26:04

This may not work. The miner with the largest amount of hashpower is also the best capitalized and will be able to buy itself into becoming the number one miner again after a PoW change.
Things that may work:
* Hold miners accountable for how they employ their hashpower by being able to identify which ASIC mined a block from the block itself.
* Create a hash function based on some graphics card functions that have already been optimized highly by graphic cards manufacturers.
* When changing PoW, secretly inform non-offending miners of the new algo so they can prepare ASICs and have a headstart.

~~That's 50 billion hashes per satoshi.~~
Lol Let's try this again.
9 minute average time between blocks;
3 BTC average fees per block.
(12.5 + 3) x 10^11 satoshi per block.
9 x 60 seconds per block.
5 x 10^18 hashes per second.
=&gt;  (9 x 60 x 5 x 10^18) / ((12.5 + 3) x 10^11) =
1.74 billion hashes per satoshi.
So 1 hash is worth 0.00000000000574 satoshi.

You have it backwards. The amount of hash rate is proportional to the value of the block reward *in fiat terms*. So, a shitcoin of low value will have a low hash rate and thus low security.

I realize that you are right but not in case of a malicious actor. Let me try to be more precise.
After the Aug 1st chain split a sophisticated user will be able to split its Bitcoin in two: LegacyBTC and 148BTC.
The user running the standard Bitcoin Core software will accept a payment with LegacyBTC from the legacy chain as normal. This payment will however not exist on the BIP148 chain, so after a reorg his LegacyBTC will be gone.


I don't believe the ramifications of BIP148 being successful are fully understood by its supporters. It seems to me that the desire to activate SegWit sooner makes them underestimate the negatives. 
That's why I am trying hard to exactly understand the damage of BIP148 to be able to offset it against the positives and make an informed comparison that is not relying on emotional arguments or sentiment but on facts instead.
I see a lot of appeal to emotions in the discussions around BIP148 on Reddit - if such appeals can be  successful then it can also be successful in pushing a nefarious change (i.e., "jump from a roof").

I don't agree. Value of goods and services may change dramatically, but the price of a good corrected for inflation makes for some very comparable numbers over time, your anecdotical evidence notwithstanding.


I never said that. My point throughout has been that there is a *desire* for such instrument to exist. People wish to store the monetary rewards for their labour securely and in a way that it doesn't lose value without having to take any risk by investing it.
Gold has been a good option throughout the ages because of its unique properties, with being scarce as the most important one. That is why gold has more value than its industrial uses alone would seem to justify. It is scarce, thus can serve as a sound store of wealth, thus giving gold more value.

Do you think it's ok when some miners hold the entire Bitcoin ecosystem hostage and sabotage progress? A small group of miners is currently blocking crucial improvements including SegWit (which doubles the on-chain transaction capacity) and the wide range of technologies that depend on it such as Lightning Network (off-chain instant transactions) and signature aggregation (additional 30% on-chain capacity increase &amp; privacy improvement).
Segwit also kills the covert AsicBoost attack on the PoW algorithm that is currently centralizing mining and continues to put more power in the hands of BitMain.
The HF proposals are unrealistic and some conspicuously failed to address the covert AsicBoost attack. It'd have given even more power to those miners that turned against Bitcoin.
The main problem Bitcoin is facing now has nothing to do with capacity but everything with misaligned incentives caused by the centralizing properties of the way PoW has been implemented.

“Bitcoin” (capital B) normally refers to the protocol:
* “I run a Bitcoin node”
* “Each year, Bitcoin gets better”
* “The privacy of Bitcoin”
* “Download a Bitcoin wallet”
“bitcoin” (lowercase b) normally refers to the token:
* “Send me some bitcoin”
* “He mined a lot of bitcoin”
* “I wish I had more bitcoin”
* “Spend some bitcoin to buy a lambo”
Basically, “bitcoin” is used in the same way as “money”, “gold” and “water”. They are called “uncountable” because you cannot use “two money” and therefore have no plural. Generally, all commodities are uncountable: “copper”, “coffee” (the raw beans), “oil”, “wheat”, etc. 
Often I leave off “bit” and just use “coin” as in:
“I have some coin to spend”
When referring to amounts, I use the currency ticker “BTC”:
* “My friend bought 3 BTC yesterday”
* “I own 5 BTC”
* “He is selling his house for 100 BTC”
But only in writing. When speaking, I’d use the word  “bitcoin” again.

From the Transferwise wikipedia page:
*Instead of transferring the sender's money directly to the recipient, it is redirected to the recipient of an equivalent transfer going in the opposite direction. Likewise, the recipient of the transfer receives a payment not from the sender initiating the transfer, but from the sender of the equivalent transfer. This process avoids costly currency conversion and transfers crossing borders.*
Remittances are uni-directional, which renders the approach of Transferwise inapplicable.
Also, Transferwise has 200 employees and charges 0.5%. With an average cost of a modest US$ 25,000 per employee (salary + taxes + indirect costs) that means they'd need to have a turnover of 1 billion to break even.
200 x 25,000 = 5,000,000 (cost)
5,000,000 / 0.005 = 1,000,000,000.
That seems flat-out unsustainable.

Bitcoin would be fine even if only say 70% of miners would be ready initially. The ones most affected by a sudden softfork are miners that weren't able to update their code in time to produce correct blocks. They'd lose income until their code has been adapted.
Allowing miners to signal "yes, ready" before activating a softfork is a courtesy to miners that are slow to update their code.

Looking at how disparate the views on Bitcoin are between r/bitcoin and r/btc, I think it has been good stewardship to separate the two. Now there is a place where each view can be discussed which is a net benefit regardless of which view one supports.
I see it as nothing more than some healthy moderation at r/bitcoin and not the same as censorship, because r/btc is out there too and any and all opinions unpopular to and removed from r/bitcoin can be consumed there at hearts content.

Hashpower only serves to proof that some amount of work has been done to create a block. It is not intended as a vote or as to have any power over anything at all.
However the current PoW mechanism is inherently centralizing and inevitably gives an unhealthy amount of power to the miner that acquires a majority (&gt; 50%) of all hashpower.
That the PoW mechanism is centralizing hashpower is something that cannot be solved. So, the solution lies elsewhere.
I believe that it must become possible to hold miners accountable for how they use their hashpower. Users must be able to reject blocks based on who mined it - or based on which rig make and model mined it.
Each block ought to contain information about the miner or rig that found the solution to the block. Perhaps by adding a message to the block that is signed by a public key of the miner or rig manufacturer.
That would incentivize miners to behave because now users have the power to brick rigs on a miner-to-miner basis. Without having to change the PoW.

There is no such deadlock. The development is going fine, also with help of the BIP process. Sure, activating segwit which is a huge protocol improvement has been sabotaged by miners, but all they achieve is to slow it down. And also, for next improvements miners will not be asked to activate again, they will be forced to.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:01:25


That's plain wrong. Miners consent is not required for segwit or any other protocol change.
Due to the unfortunate way segwit was designed to activate, miners are now in the position to delay segwit by refusing to signal readiness.
All this does is that it will just take longer for segwit to activate. Miners do not have any power over the protocol, it's nodes and ultimately the economic majority that does. Miners can't stop segwit or any other protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:53:39
The HF proposal is completely retarded. First of all, they don't need Core to do a HF, they can just do it themselves.
It's really simple. Copy the codebase, put it in a Git repository and make the HF changes, and release a shiny new Alt-Bitcoin with blocks any size they desire.
But apparently they want Core to do the HF for them. Sure, Core can create a copy for them as well and even make the changes.
But what they cannot do is force Core devs to continue to code on their fork. Also, they can't force the community to adopt their fork.
So Core can make the HF for them and then continue to develop on the prefork software.
This is all too stupid to begin with.

That would require at minimum &gt; 50% of miners to play along. Also, this will likely mobilize nodes to change consensus and only consider the chain in which the hack transaction is present as the valid chain. This to protect the immutability of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin shares all characteristics and properties of gold except for the fact that Bitcoin isn't tangible.
Not being tangible gives Bitcoin additional useful properties over gold: it can be transferred over communication lines, it has no weight or volume and can be stored safely without the need for building expensive vaults.
It seems to me that these are amongst real properties that lend Bitcoin its value. The other ones being scarcity and divisibility, like gold.


A stock reflects the present value of all future dividends expected to be paid by the company. Company stock cannot reasonably be compared with a commodity or Bitcoin.

User here.
Core has been doing a fantastic job creating a code base that every single altcoin uses as a base. It's almost as if no other altcoin has had the skills to pull off what Core devs did: create a cryptocurrency from scratch.
So I'll stick their software as long as they fit my views on cryptocurrency which is being trustless and decentralized. Core vigorously defends these properties which has strengthened my trust in them even further.
I'd be happy to see anyone having a different view to fork off to a coin that cares less about being trustless. Anyone can make their own judgement to see if they still think Bitcoin is a good fit to them or if JihanCoin or PayPal might be a better fit.

Of course there will be manipulation but there's also somewhat of a positive side to it. The price action reveals otherwise difficult to obtain clues about the best way forward for Bitcoin.
For instance, the price drop to sub-2000 levels was stopped only after a sufficient fraction of miners started signalling BIP91 to bring it close the lock-in treshold of 80%.
The spectacular Litecoin and Vertcoin price rises around the time of Segwit lock-in was also telling.
If miners fail to lock in BIP91 then the price might well crash back to sub-2000 levels. If there had been any intentional manipulation then one of its results was the confirmation that segwit is the way forward according to the market.

I'm sure you're aware that a lot of people take his opinion very seriously and for good reasons too.
I don't understanding why the risks around the BIP148 softfork aren't actively mitigated.
Actions to diminish risk would be:
* Alignment between prominent Core devs - this disagreement over BIP148 is getting dangerous, can introduce long term divisiveness which is not healthy for the future of Bitcoin. How about a single unified statement on BIP148 by all Core devs?
* Killing covert AsicBoost is used as an argument to push BIP148 but that shouldn't be any factor - whether BIP148 has merit should be judged only on the fact that it might activate SegWit more quickly and on the associated risks. So why not implement Gregs' Kill-Covert-AsicBoost BIP? That would make the discussions more to the point and leave us with just overt AsicBoost which is easy to kill off using additional softforks.
* The dangers of BIP148 aren't widely understood. In what scenarios can it fail? What if come November 15 the legacy chain is longest? Will the BIP148 chain be reorged away? Luke-jr makes it sound as if BIP148 can't fail but then why would Greg regard it dangerous? Can we have at least some agreement between Core devs on possible outcomes?
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:18:18
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:26:22
BIP148 will get more user support if Core speaks out in favor of it. But Core can only support it if there is sufficient user support. Catch-22.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:45:47
What about people running a node using Bitcoin Core which is the most widely used software and who are rightfully thinking they're all good? Won't they remain on the legacy chain? Wouldn't that mean that any payments they receive after Aug 1st will be reorged away if BIP148 wins, saddling them with losses?
How can you explain to them that they should have run some alternative software instead? And in the event BIP148 succeeds, won't this set a dangerous precedent and won't it encourage future populists tactics to entice switching to a non-Core client with possibly more nefarious changes?
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:16:43
The problem is not with SHA2. In fact if it weren't for AsicBoost, SHA2 is presumably well known by know which is an advantage.
If a new PoW is introduced, any ASIC manufacturer that finds an optimization that others fail to discover will be able to drive out other manufacturers out of the market. That's because of the way PoW is designed - the difficulty is driven up onto a point that only the most efficient ASIC can be profitable.
The solution that I see is to hold ASIC manufacturers accountable for how they use their rigs. If maliciously, it must be possible for the Bitcoin nodes to reject blocks based on the very ASIC that found it. 
This implies the ability to identify the manufacturer of the ASIC that found a block. That will enable nodes to reject blocks on a manufacturer basis, which in turn incentivizes manufacturers to avoid malicious mining. Also, any 51% attack can be easily neutralized by dropping blocks of the self-mining manufacturer that performs the attack.
I think it should be technically possible with a combination of public-private key pair. An ASIC must  be mining a hash such that PubKey(SHA2(nonce)) has the required difficulty. To do that, the ASIC must use the on-chip private key while hashing. The manufacturer can publish its public key on their website so nodes can be created that have the key compiled in.

Bitcoin is very competitive. Actually, it has no competition! Bitcoin is the only "product" that lets two parties do a peer to peer payment without having to meet in person. It can be done over distance. Bitcoin is absolutely unique in that regard.
To keep this competitive edge, it must remain trustless and thus decentralized. Or else it will be just another PayPal, Skrill, Venmo, GooglePay, ApplePay etc. It would be much *worse* as Bitcoin is inconvenient, difficult to use, slow and offers no insurance compared to these mentioned newfangled payment methods. Lack of transaction capacity is the least of the issues here.

Your example shows that a car, a house, cash and other goods are not guaranteed to keep their value. To that I agree wholeheartedly.
Perhaps you may now start to appreciate the benefits of owning a scarce substance that is also compact, easy to store and transfer, almost impossible to counterfeit, durable, divisible and easy to identify - gold.
The value of gold here is given mostly by the above properties. Its scarcity ensures that it cannot easily be inflated.
My point is that your example beautifully demonstrates why gold is valued much higher than it would be in case its value were only based on the demand for its physical properties *sans* its scarcity.
The mere property of being scarce has lend gold most of its value through the ages because it enabled preserving wealth, autonomously.
That is why in times of economic distress the value of gold goes up - it indicates increasing demand for a a-political store of value that is being perceived as a better store of value than fiat.
The promise of scarcity is also given by Bitcoin, the primary property needed for any store of value. But not only that - as it exists in digital form, giving Bitcoin advantageous properties as compared to gold that I won't rehash.
The market is in the process of confirming that a store of value first and foremost requires an instrument that proofs to be fundamentally scarce. Bitcoin keeps increasing in value (long term) as it is attempting to demonstrate another crucial property for a store of value: durability. Being the first of its kind, people are rightfully sceptical of the durability of Bitcoin - even if it remains scarce, it is hard to convince people that a bug in the software or a hack won't make Bitcoin vanish or become worthless overnight. However, seven years of uninterrupted existence slowly but steadily convinces a slow but steadily increasing number of people that it might be possible after all for something purely digital to be scarce and durable.
There are many properties which Bitcoin hasn't yet fully proven to possess. If it would have, all BTC would have been at least as valuable as all gold. However right now it's only a tiny fraction of that. This reflects uncertainties: what if its scarcity is circumvented by the invention of a new and more popular cryptocurrency? A BTC may be scarce, but cryptocurrencies are in potentially endless supply. Only time can tell whether Bitcoin can indeed survive long term and remain ahead of competing cryptocurrencies. So far this seems to be the case, but a perfect split in two camps amongst the developers over the consensus rules can decimate its value. It would potentially cause a disastrous hardfork creating two Bitcoins of which no one knows which of the two will prevail. The human factor is its weakest point.
So I am not at all dismissing the possibility that Bitcoin can ultimately fail. However it is in no way comparable to a penny stock or pyramid scheme. No false promises about quick riches are made by Bitcoin Inc. - there is no organization behind Bitcoin. Taking on Bitcoin from that angle only but draws ridicule and hostility. You can be forgiven for being sceptical about its scarcity and durability as Bitcoin isn't tangible but just some bits in some sort of distributed storage called the Blockchain governed by a computer program that potentially anyone can modify. No one can know if it works - but we can say after seven and a half years: so far so good. And the market visibly rewards its continuous existence by rewarding it an ever higher value per BTC.

* r/btc is a cesspool full of shills and sockpuppets that spread misinformation about Bitcoin and Blockstream. They smear and slander Bitcoin core developers by outright lying and continue to repeat the same lies over and over again. It is impossible to engage in any normal discussions in that shitsub.

I am quite concerned that trezor is now integrating code of third parties into its firmware in order to support altcoins. Are you referring to the same issue?
