No matter which one I use it's always off by a bit, tried all exchanges with various "local currencies" and it's always wrong.

it says 23 days ago, that's when all the other accounts were hacked too.. this guy just didn't notice for awhile. OP look in r/btc you probably "upvoted" a bunch of posts too.

It's all the same. 
With swing trades you're given some lube before getting your ass pounded.
With hodling you get to pound some ass before you get your ass pounded. 
And of course, some people like having their ass pounded, and thus we have day trading.

Actually, if you don't hang around with beggars, and thieves, you should be good.

yea I tried with no currency selected, and a few different combinations and it was never accurate. I know mycelium isn't an exchange but why would it even give you the options of selecting a bunch of different exchanges when it would be much easier to select an average than whatever it is they do to deduce their value for each exchange. I just don't get where those random numbers are coming from.

TIL bitcoin started in the past, and will continue in the future.

mine is changing every few minutes, and I can't see any trades for the amounts it's showing. it's saying like 20,500-21,000. something smells fishy.
