Well verbalised. I share the excitement but I'm also cautiously keen to see Bitcoin manage to plod, unaffected, through the continuing attacks from the financial system, governments, and their friends in the media. It'll be a rocky ride for sure but something tells me Bitcoin will still be around in 10 years, like a fly that refuses to be swatted or something like that

I'm almost paranoid about FUD so occasionally I'll see it where there is none. I don't know anymore but the "message" here (to me at least) is Bitcoin is old and frail - and that's just 180 from the truth. It is thriving much to the annoyance of a few.

Illegality is the mother of all invention. Censorship resistance is the built-in government-proofing 'Satoshi' understood all to well was crucial to its success.
"Blockchain but not Bitcoin" does seem to be the current formula for bankers, government ministers and their media minions. That's the narrative but then again, all three have been shown to be utterly wrong every step of the way in Bitcoin's history to date.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:05:21
If it's not too much in value then it's probably not the end of the world but it's bad practice. The point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank, not rely on any third parties for storage.
You could just store in a free paper wallet which, when done [relatively safely]( is secure enough. Use one address to send to, and, once you spend, regenerate a new paper wallet and switch your funds to that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:10:22
You do not own the money you deposit in your bank. You have an account which you get in exchange for an unsecured loan to which the bank usually allows you access. For people outside the EU (apart from Greeks and Cypriots), North America and Australasia, it's unthinkable that the bank won't let you have access to your money. To the rest of the world, it's old news.

If you are a blockchain engineer, which you are not, then cheap transactions would not be first on your list of priorities; you'd have a deep understanding of the primary objective of Bitcoin's MO, namely censorship resistance.

Ah the tinfoil hat, very good. You know that, amid the current war on cash transactions imposed by central banks across the globe, interest rates are at nearly zero, you know that the Fed and BoE and ECB have been printing money to keep enough liquidity in the markets to avert a downturn, and you know surely that all three of these combined must have consequences. If you were a Cypriot or a Greek or a Venezuelan you'd need much less pursuading as to why bankbound fiat, regardless of capital insurance which has been proven worthless, is at risk, probably when you're least expecting it. Lastly consider the bail-in legislation which took place across Europe at national level at the same time as Cypriot retail accounts were being stolen from. I wasn't being in the least bit contentious, I think you may have assumed a whole host of personality traits based on a single sentence though.

If in doubt, don't. You *may* miss some action by waiting a month of course but where there's markets, there's uncertainty. Fight the fomo though, always.
Demand is a good question; at what point will no-one want to buy? Well, basic price action is driven by this metric anyway, lower prices means there are fewer buyers. Look at the general trend, it's upward due to the fundamentals plus the limited supply. This subject requires deeper reading. Understand what Bitcoin is, how it changes the world and why (hint: Andreas Antonopoulos) and believe me, the more you learn, the more exciting it becomes. I've seen respected old-skool traders saying it'll go to $2-5m and other say it'll crash and burn. They can't both be right but I don't know who's right. No-one does.
Just go in with your eyes open, remember that, while the early dotcom bubble contained many successes, the real winners came along much later on, and the same scenario could occur again. In other words the eventual winner in crypto might not have been born yet. This is a space which I've been involved in since 2013 and frankly it still confuses the fk out of me. But it's fun, and should it go to zero tomorrow I will still have the shirt on my back.

Listen, you're doing the right things, if you were a crypto millionaire but in bad health, the money would mean nothing. If you're healthy and relatively happy, that's just about the best place to be in life. You know it, I'm just stating the obvious but it's damn true. Focus only on the bad, and the bad things are what dominates your thinking.
We as humans tend to live with one foot in the past, and another in the future and rarely do we appreciate NOW and the joys which can be had by doing so. Live more in the moment, enjoy the ride. What-ifs cause mental breakdowns, depression, stop you from progressing and lock you down to an event which exists only in your head. Focus on what you do have, what's real and where you want to be in the future.

Great that you want to benefit your family, just avoid the most obvious mistake: FOMO. Fear of missing out, usually accompanied by adrenalin and an overwhelming urge to climb aboard the bandwagon. It's currently near the all time high. Smart money doesn't invest at those times and you will most likely to be fine to wait until there's a dip (10%, 20% whatever). There's always luck involved, noone can tell if Bitcoin will go to 100k or to $100. 
With regard the altcoins, some of them are going to do extremely well. But most of them will die. Personally I would not go near them unless you can spend the time to understand the business models and get a feel for their potential to the point where you can believe in a project yourself. Pick 3 to 5 alts which grab you and research them, go to the reddits, get wide-ranging opinions and use your head to make your mind up. I'm not stupid but altcoins is where I've lost money over the last few years; that space is brutal, very volatile and there's a lot of insider information dictating the price action. Best of luck.

Once you get a handle on what Bitcoin is and what its priorities are (clue: you made no mention of it), which centuries-old problems it solves *and how*, what the banks are doing as a result of it and the ramifications for the existing system, then you'd not ask such questions.

The protocol *is* a trust platform by dint of how it works. It brings in *everyone* to eliminate the reliance on the few, corrupt, greedy financiers who always appropriate others' wealth for themselves. The history of money demonstrates that, if left with an institution for long enough, it will nearly always get stolen. That's trustlessness.
Your question is a really good one, meriting a deeper discussion, but open distribution of the ledgers is possibly how we might come to trust one another more, not less imo.

It's like trying to explain "internet" to someone in 1990. Not easy until something triggers their interest. I think a better approach is to talk about what Bitcoin represents, and [this short video]( video, on [this]( thread posted yesterday by encapsulates it rather well.

It *is* an important topic, *that's* why the corporate media keeps banging on about how "flawed" it is. The bigger picture is that the future of transactional comms will be led by b/c tech.

OP you worry me with your suggestions for biometric identification. Bitcoin arose at the same time as billions of dollars were being wiped out in spite of untold regulations, government oversight, guidelines etc. Legal recourse?
The whole point of the protocol is to form a trust platform, disseminated globally, with no one point of failure. Once regulations, identification, and judicial oversight are brought in, Bitcoin AND the whole concept behind it dies and it just becomes part of the central banking cartel which to date has served no-one other than itself.

Your questions are far from stupid, but you're best off finding a couple of "how does bitcoin work" type videos on youtube. Really.
Bitcoin is not stored "in" anything but the blockchain itself, a public ledger of transactions, stored forever. An address has transactions *associated* with it, so by sending bitcoin to an address, the ledger associates amounts with an address which you can see if you paste the PUBLIC address into blockchain.info. The private key acts like a password so you can move it. Hacking is possible but once you've familiarised yourself with the fundamentals of how bitcoin addresses and keys are generated, your worries will fly away.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:06:34
Sure, fundamentals do not relate to price action in crypto much at all. But 7k without a hint of CME futures, $6 while being slated as a fraud by "repsected" institutional pack leaders. I got in in 2012, and if anything Bitcoin gets more impressive every day, the more I learn about the core team.

For five euros, that's a lot of time you've spent writing that.
Just buy a little, if you find it interesting and rewarding then buy more. 
Holding is wise mainly due to the volatility seen in Bitcoin's USD equivalent value. It's dropped 80% in a day before and there's no guarantee it won't again. Long term however, the trend is up.
Yes, you can deal in fractions, right down to a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.
The fee thing is a question because you don't yet understand. I'm not going to explain fees here, save to say don't believe nonsense about huge fees. I moved a thousand bucks yesterday for $0.10. Bitcoin is not the fastest or cheapest, but Bitcoin is first and foremost about censorship resistance and security, not buying coffees and sandwiches.
Good luck.

You must be from America, or the UK or Canada or Australia. Because people from other countries, whose governments and banks have just stolen from private retail bank accounts don't need Bitcoin to be the "perfect", just another, slowly improving method of value transaction which is less likely to be appropriated by the banking system which has fucked them and their families, slowly and surely for generations.  Perhaps you're not that familiar with the implications of what credit facilitation in a debt based economy *really* means. Heck, bankers I've spoken to about CF didn't have a damn clue, not did any realise that none of us owns the money in our bank accounts. Talk to a Cypriot, their banks, under the aegis of the ECB and IMF colluded to overturn deposit guarantees, insurance and simply take money from private individuals. Suck on that for a minute. It's because none of those people owned the money in their bank account. The topmost layer of the Bitcoin phenomenon is not value, it's not ease of use, it's not cheap transactions. Rather, it is censorship resistance and security; therein lies the emergent value. Protection from banks and from governments.
I can't argue with some of what you say, including the speculative aspect and current over-expectations which makes me cringe occasionally, but Bitcoin was *never designed to replace fiat debt*, and fundamental misunderstandings like this (which occur on both sides) isn't helping anyone. So the "actual facts" of which you speak need to come from your perspective too. We're not all lunatics and/or pitchfork-bearers you know, some of us do actually understand the world in which we live rather better than many orthodox thinkers so readily assume and, while it's preposterous to say that Bitcoin is The Solution, the ethos behind it, the invention which blows the mind of many an analyst who deigns to investigate properly, appears to have won the hearts of many a sceptic. Maybe, once you have a good look yourself, you might have a minor epiphany yourself.

The problem with the "fees killing Bitcoin" argument is the price. It keeps going up. It's just not as big a deal as *some* folks like to make out. No-one wants to buy a muffin with Bitcoin. And to date, my ave tx fee is between 10c and 50c. When fees went right up, the price went up. When half the miners deserted Bitcoin, the price went up. What do we do? Why the urgency?
Schiff is not a stupid fella, he's a damn good salesman, able to talk the hind legs off a donkey and a lot of what he says about gold and debt money is bang on. But his only correct call was the property crash in 2008 and, in commenting on Bitcoin, he's applying orthodox logic to an unprecedented, highly unorthodox phenomenon.

1. Bitcoin =/= bus money. Primarily it is a censorship resistant and secure form of value exchange.
2. UX is not Bitcoin's strength that's true and time is needed to understand. It's a nightmare for newcomers with zero knowledge but imagine email in 1980, you needed to be an ace with CLIs and DOS. Bill Gates didn't invent the technology behind Windows, he packaged it up with user experience as the priority and sold it. The same will happen very quickly with crypto.

Ultimately it's just my poxy opinion but it's a fairly informed one; impulse is the worst foundation for decision making. If in doubt, do more research, and doing nothing is often better than trading an idea. I'm worried you'll trade your btc for alts to catch a nice upside and this is just not as straightforward as it has been until about August this year. I'd stongly suggest, if you want something else, buy some when you can afford it and leave the btc alone.

Censorship resistance. The outer armour of the Bitcoin phenomenon and the basis of its success. Many people whine about ease of use but without censorship resistance and killer security, there would be no point. Of course governments were always going to attack this thing.

I like lighting the same things. It's true that it's not immediately obvious just what a mother-invention this is. It's unorthodox and new and requires lateral thinking. When delving in, it becomes apparent that Bitcoin is more than a clever decentralised system of value exchange. It's pure goddam genius, very cunning, well thought out and multi faceted, using a structure of motivation for users, developers and operators that works up, down and sideways, in much the same way gold has for milennia. It stands on its own, is immutable, incorruptible, subject to no single point of failure, and it works. It is its own business model to boot.
I worked it out recently too. An expensive delve into trading alts in 2014 on an exchange which went belly up taking my money with it led me to drop it all like a stone and not look back...until the recent excitement when I decided to sit down and spend some time looking at what it's really all about.

It auto-filled with a pre-set fee. It may or may not let you adjust it I'm not sure as I've not used Bitpay, but that is exorbitant. A fee of $0.05 would have gone through in between 0.5 and 7 hours in my experience.

My opinion: Be careful of alts - many will be around for a long time, but many will not. The pro is they're more volatile so more chances for profits but you have to know what you're doing and be emotionless about it.
If I were you, accumulate BTC first and do not sell. If you want to dabble in alts, buy more BTC specifically for it but don't keep dipping into your BTC for flaky unresearched altcoins. I've a strong feeling that in years to come the question most people will be asking is "so how much BTC did you end up with?"

"Kill" the Prof's dissonance with kindness, not snipes or clever retribution (however mild I'm sure it would be). Be generous, this man is in charge of educating many, so change his opinion and lots will prosper.
Rather than giving the Prof btc in a paper wallet off the bat, you could quietly (and earnestly) offer a friendly demonstration, one-on-one, of a Bitcoin transaction and then hand the Prof the keys.
Prof may hold a little ego-wound for a day or two but acts of kindness such as this are not quickly forgotten; they simmer in the recipient's mind and can often change behaviour as a result. It's possible he may educate himself and will see you as something of a mini-god in a few weeks.

HSBC is not an exception. Perhaps you aren't aware, or expect it to be reported on CNBC? Either way, when the regulators turn a blind eye, then getting het up about Bitcoin seems a little misguided, but that's just my opinion. 
How do they shut it down? I mean, for that to work, the entire internet would need to die, and, if you understand how much money governments pour into fragile cable networks just to keep the population from revolting, perhaps it's not too much of a stretch to understand that killing the internet is off the cards for now. Illegality does not imply unlawfulness either. By owning Bitcoin, no-one is harmed, no-one suffers loss. Legislation might be brought in, a la prohibition, but all that did (since it was morally questionable) was spawn a host of new and inventive ways of circumventing a daft piece of legislation.

In terms of money laundering, possibly the worse documented case recently involved HSBC, $700bn of laundered money (in USD) and an estimated 19,000 deaths. No-one went to jail. To date governments have had virtual monopolies on terrorism, money laundering and drug trafficking so you're pissing in the wind. If you think about it, governments would have shut Bitcoin down by now, *if they could*. But on the contrary, institutional investors are clamouring to pile in.

It looks like a paper 2FA method. Localbitcoins offers this so, rather than having SMS 2FA, you print out a sheet offline and use the code corresponding to the number asked for while logging in with username and password. I've not seen this used for wallets but perhaps I'm wrong.

"Blockchain" without "Bitcoin" is a word oft-repeated by those who seem more enamoured of established banking cartels than freedom for their own kids. The bad news for fans of "blockchain" specifically while omitting to mention Bitcoin, is that Bitcoin seems to be beating every attack without making any counter effort whatsoever.
Come to the light side. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:01:06
No, I use localbitcoins and cryptomate. I'm in the UK.
I did do a bank x-fer with blockchain which went through ok, but I don't want to wait 3-5 days for them to be ready anbd/or the price to shoot up. Worth calling your bank though.

You can protect your assets by doing the following:
1. Download bitaddress.org (search on github)
2. Go offline 
3. Unzip the download and fire up the HTML page
3. Follow instructions to generate a paper wallet
4. Print it
5. Restart PC
6. Send coins to this address.
Or buy a Ledger Nano S, Trezor or similar and follow the instructions provided.

You have to decide. I bought a little today. Turns out by pure luck it was the lowest it went but I can't pretend I actually have a clue. That's the deal: no-one knows. A lot of people would suggest buying in a little every month. If I were you I'd just spunk it now but that's certainly not advice.
It all depends how precious $500 is, whether you can afford to lose it and what you expect to get out of it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:41:02
You don't get that. The wallet.dat file is associated with software wallets, this is different. The private key is enough, yes. Make sure you create the address and priv key when you are OFFLINE though.

You didn't want to bring it up, I understand now. But...you did and now I've done exactly what you were trying to avoid. Sorry.
The issue is the *naming* of the forks, not the fact that forks are happening. Perhaps I assume too much as a software guy but I take it as read that everyone knows that software branches all the time for innovation and improvement. Just maybe don't take code provided in good faith, call it a variation of the original and pass it off as the genuine article. Other than that, I don't see much fork hate.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:34:20
Because you have a healthy cynicism! It's a constant source of bemusement but I'm not giving up.

When you want to move it, you'll need to import the private key into a wallet (e.g. electrum or samourai).
I would advise getting a hardware wallet if you want to move funds regularly but for hodling a paper wallet is fine.

With respect, I think this is a view many people hold until such time as they get their ass into gear and take the time to learn about what it is. It's not explicable in a sentence or a paragraph, you need to take time out and learn about this paradigm shift in technology for yourself. The confidence increases the more one knows.
It's not insignificant that Bitcoin was the first, attracts the world's most dedicated crypto developers, has the best recognition, has stood the test of time longest, withstood attacks from within, without, malevolent and otherwise. Maybe it won't always the the top crypto, who knows, but for now, if you've noticed, the noises from the established financial institutions ought to tell you a thing or two about how their attitude towards Bitcoin has morphed from amusement to hostility to ridicule to acceptance in the last few weeks. 


What exactly is its value? I've no idea myself, just waiting to find out and see because Bitcoin and associated technology is unprecedented and impacts on one of the most fundamental activities of human existence.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:47:36

Great post. We see, from those who've made Bitcoin their life's work, that the more one delves into the workings of it and takes time to appreciate its cunning genius, the exponentially impressed one becomes.
Bitcoin the invention is so well thought out and multi faceted, using a clever structure of motivation for users, developers and operators that works up, down and sideways, that should one aspect fail, corrupt, or get attacked, it will set itself right again. It stands on its own, is immutable, incorruptible, subject to no single point of failure, and it works as its very own business model. No surprise then that the big boys are now piling in. Having already spent billions instructing teams of developers to investigate, banks are coming to the realisation that they've been outmaneuvered, at least for now.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:50:45
You're right. I'd say possibly 'higher motives'. There are forces out there with unlimited fiat to spend on anything which threatens their position. Setting up a few companies could be just a means to a much bigger end.

I feel you, and I'd be made of salt too. Even a $10 start is possible, though economies of scale mean you won't get as much coin as you might hope. But $10 would mean you're "in" and could follow the news with a bit more adrenhalin. If you can't spare $10 then I apologise for suggesting it.

Maybe you're right if OP is investing thousands, I love my Nano but don't let's pretend a paper wallet is "technical" or unfamiliar. They've been around longer than hardware wallets, are pretty damn secure if created using a few simple pointers, and consist of a username and password, that's all. It's familiar to most as a concept, and imo they're perfectly adequate for investing a couple of hundred.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:58:34
It's basically a bitcoin address and private key with associated QR codes. That's all, nothing more, nothing less. It takes various formats but it's zero cost rather than CAD140 which is why I suggest it. Go to bitaddress.org (check the url, and the ssl), scroll to the bottom, click on the zip file link next to "Github repository", go offline, unzip and open the html file, follow instructions to create wallet, print and restart PC before going back online.
If you can afford a hardware wallet, or intent on increasing your crypto position, then that is the way to go but for now, it's more secure than keeping it on an exchange or online wallet imo.

There's your problem, the elephant in the room. Promising not to tackle the gnarly issue which makes the whole topic interesting isn't a good thing. 
Neither of your two examples of Bitcoin forks, Namecoin and Litecoin, stole the name Bitcoin and did PR jobs on how it's the "real Bitcoin". I don't think many would dispute that forks are inevitable, and potentially beneficial, even for some of the reasons you describe. It's not forks people have an issue with, it's the downright shifty way it's being done.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:41:12
No, you don't need an account anywhere, with the following method you will get a public and private key which you can import to a wallet in the future for spending/moving.
Go to bitaddress.org, check the SSL certificate (so you know you're on the right site), scroll to the bottom, click on Github link. Click on download in Git.
Now go offline. Unzip the file, and in the unzipped folder, open the HTML file. Follow instructions (still offline), print a copy of the address and key.
Send bitcoin to the PUBLIC address and treat the private key like a bundle of cash.

It doesn't matter so long as the address is generated in the window you show in the first screenshot. You'll receive and have control over the coins you send to any address the Ledger generates. As soon as you receive coins to one address, the "receive" will generate a new address. It's all good.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:44:36
I'll get shot down most likely but imo you'd be fine with a paper wallet IF you follow the basic rules of doing so to minimise risk and use a well maintained computer. I find it slightly ridiculous that currently the only acceptable recommendation here is a hardware wallet. I have a Nano, it's brilliant but a paper wallet is fine - though there's never 100% security.
