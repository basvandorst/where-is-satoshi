Really smart concept!
Sent ~0.02 BTC from Gox yesterday as a test. Then the site went down until sometime today. Just tried now, site up, and my coins were in my acc. Bought "real" BTC at an effective price of ~$776/BTC (0.76gox/real + gox and bb fees). That's a bit steep, but not if Gox really is going down. :P Waiting for them to be (manually) sent to my private wallet tomorrow.

Please read up about some site that used to exchange Magic The Gathering cards ... And ended up going down in very suspect bankruptcy, robbing an enormous amount of people of their bitcoins. It was called MtGox.

Changetip is a lot smaller than MtGox was, that's true. But I don't see why we shouldn't request a proof. I would say one of the biggest security concerns for Bitcoin is scamming and theft. It makes it very easy for the "bad guys". Also, changetip will probably grow a lot  (like MtGox did).

New stats are nice btw! :) GOX/bitstamp :o
But I can't see the graph in Firefox :/

How do you know these adresses are owned by Gox?
Probably something I am missing?
(Do you know that excel has an option to import comma separated values?)
