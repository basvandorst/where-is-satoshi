Why would anyone wait until after "tax season" to pull gains?

Maybe, but there website has been down for a few days now.

Dang, I wish I had some extra funds right now to pick up some cheap coins.

Any thought to Bitconnect causing this downturn? I don’t know now much BTC they had, but I’m guessing it’s enough to cause something like this. Use all the BTC they scammed from people to quickly cash out into FIAT, which in-turn crashes the market and takes the heat off them since most people are talking the drop in BTC.

Already made a pretty good profit when I bought a few hours ago. Should I sell?

My buy wall at 13.6k should keep the price down for a while. Merry Christmas to all you HODLers!

Nothing like a $530k+ payday! Looks like Andreas is on his way to be a bitcoin millionaire! Well deserved!

He’s actually going to be neither. It’s not going to 0 nor are the profits made from €3000 enough to be considered “filthy rich”.

Quickly drove home to transfer my coins stored on my Trezor to Gdax in preparation to sell........what the hell was I thinking? Luckily I was smart enough a month ago to move my coins from gdax just for this sort of event. HODL!!!!!

Agreed, just dumped a bunch of BTC into dogecoin!

The sell wall at 13.6k is starting to get chipped away!
