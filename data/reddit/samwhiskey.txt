All his talk has given me a wonderful idea to do what he thinks he's gonna do but on a different platform and decentralized. Just gotta find time to work out the bugs and get some more technical people on board. 
I hope he's just full of hot air and doesn't do anything now so I can  corner the market.

2012 Bought drugs. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:05:41
$8200 before the end of the year, then maybe  a little lower at the first of the year. 
Next year should see a more normal rise, slower and steadier. 
New buyers will get out on the price drop from profit takers which will drop it further. 
Almost none of the new people getting in will have the guts to hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:08:54
It's not a bad idea to buy when the bubble pops but good luck figuring all that out. 
Dollar cost averaging is probably a smarter strategy.

Chambers would work with ventilation and cooling equipment to make up the lack. 
Fresh, hot air moved to underground area to be cooled, to computing room (which is cool), the to another cool underground chamber to transfer some heat to the ground, the exhausted to the outside. 
Heat is transferred via inexpensive to operate fans instead of heat producing cooling equipment. 
There's always a way to engineer cost effective heat transfer.

Legalize all drugs in the USA. Problem solved on both sides of the border. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:49:59
Wouldn't a real solution be to try and help improve the economic stability of Mexico?  If Mexico was prosperous then Mexicans wouldn't need to send money from America to relatives in Mexico. 
It's time to realize that Mexico is joined to the US and it would b mutually beneficial for both countries to be economically stable and prosperous. 
I really don't think transfer of wealth is the solution. Bitcoin can indeed help bypass a Trump block of money transfer but the larger problem remains.

What is your view on his guilt pertaining to murder or murder for hire?
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:56:40
Sorry if I didn't make it clear. I stand correct in the not charged. Point I was making is innocent until proven guilty. Which he never was proven guilty and is therefore innocent of any murder or murder for hire charges. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:31:01
You really don't know much about it. Unjust laws should be broken.  The war on drugs facilitates the violence, not a free trade market.

Come on man, what kind of made up shit are you trying to argue?
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:54:13
Shit, I'm sorry. I was under the assumption he wasn't convicted of murder or murder for hire. 
I stand corrected. His trial for that and conviction on those charges definitely change my view of that guilty murderer. 
Thanks for setting things straight.

Innocent until proven guilty. He was never tried for it therefore he is innocent of it. Or do we convict people in the court of public opinion? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:44:55
He was never tried for that, or even charged.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:52:17
Thankfully he did. It had been a wonderful benefit to society and dude is a hero. The best thing for the world is to end the war on drugs and take them out of the hands of violent criminals. That's what Silk Road did. Paint whatever picture you want of Ross or weapons for sale or anything else, but that market  place is the picture of what the future could hold for the world. Non violent transactions between adults deciding what to do with their own bodies. All arguments against that are clouds without rain. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:28:07
Was he tried and convicted? No? Then he is innocent. Enjoy your debate on someone's guilt who was never tried on a charge. Innocent until proven guilty is probably something you champion unless you disagree with the person charged.

@_date: 2015-09-14 01:59:10
I understand that but I don't think you get my point. If he rides it out and the price goes back up like it almost  always does, then he didn't lose anything. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:05:04
When I buy Bitcoin the price drops. After I spend my Bitcoin on drugs the price shoots up. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 05:51:55
It is when the market treats it that way but when it is pegged to a currency and fluctuates according to that currency then it's value is based on that.
