yes it sounds like a scam that's why i want confirmed opinion from someone who has used it, i think there's money to be made if you can intuitively predict in 1 minute intervals based on the recent up and down patterns in the graph, and of course if you tune into the big news you can guess big swings and dips that are likely

i'm not talking about a few 100 dollars in bitcoin, if i had to make an investment in bitcoin i'd go big with all i had for a 5 year lock and forget. when this much amount of fiat is taken our of the bank and wired to some account, i bet the taxman will notice and it would not be very peace of mind to have bitcoin bought using undeclared money. anyway, what do you think the govt's threshold amount be in order for them to say, ok here's your $x for your 1 btc, transfer it now, $100, $1000, 2k?

@_date: 2018-05-30 20:17:50
i was just wondering if this did happen, today, what would i say my bitcoin is worth, i'd have to be wary of picking a number too low or too high. If 1000s of people were theoretically confronted with this same tactic today, the average price they would all quote would be the real price of bitcoin. I.e. not so low that the authorities won't mind buying them, and not too high that you're overpaying taxes.
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:06:48
open the .png in a notepad or a hex editor, towards the end there is a diagonal pattern of gibberish, i opened other png files, they don't have such a pattern, could it be the code for the hidden text inside the image? it is a big 7mb file after all 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:15:32
if i was the govt. i'd start by hiring a team of networking experts to use all available national surveillance and banking records to find the addresses of say just dozens of bitcoin holders. Then confront this first batch with the two hypothetical questions in the OP post and blow the news out of proportion scaring hundreds, and rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2018-05-21 00:07:08
op's business prints greeting cards, maybe a printout will help, though i'm not confident if an a4 or even a3 printout will reveal much, the width is 10800 pixels height is 7200 pixels, is there a reason why op saved the file in these dimensions? even a 2000 pixels height image would have been sufficient to read the smallest words
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:58:55
what happens to the coins when key is destroyed? lost forever? so the true total will be less than 21 million
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:21:53
please tell do we need a string or do we need 12 words?
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:32:58
string turned out to be something else, it showed in the Raw Data field in the File &gt; File Info menu in Photoshop, but then i noticed it is the same for any image i opened so it is probably the identifier of the Adobe Software install instance not that of the png. I later googled about "how to hide text inside image" amd got excited but after trying on 4-5 steganography apps it was a dead end. Seems like it's a visual puzzle, nothing hidden digitally. See my other comment in this thread about the 12-13 words with first letter Capitalised.

i just want 1 huuuge crash because usa fed bans bitcoin or something (a try bound to fail) or something else that scares noobs and idiot-holders (smart hodlers won't budge of course)so i can buy more, as im sure the price is indeed going to go to the moon in the next 3-5 years
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:05:15
the owner of this store must be the one who is saddest about the price rise, thinking, if only he was accepting bitcoin at the time, he would have been a zillionaire right now, but instead someone else profited massively from his pizza
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:58:56
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:43:31
at some point, bitcoin will stabilise after reaching a high price, then holding and speculating will be useless, people will use it as a currency as it was meant to be
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:12:22
i also went posting for this answer when i thought i had the 12 words, i didn't. if you have 12 words you want to try, first of all they have to be in the correct order, even if you have 12 correct words, if word 1 is put in 2nd place and word 2 in first place, the wallet recovery will fail. others have said that most new wallets have recover/import option where you can enter a seed phrase which has 12 words. i tried copay app and they have "import wallet" option and then you can enter 12 words there.
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:48:45

@_date: 2018-05-17 23:24:29
anyway, what's with the recent price fall, cough, market correction? i can imagine the mental condition of people who bought at 19k and are hodling, ofcourse itll increase, but those people current have lost like 10k per coin, they must be rattled
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:35:43
whoa, maybe someone will find a way to recover those like digital treasure hunters
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:42:32
ok, i'm going to go ahead and give whatever answers i think are possible, anyway no one reads and upvotes my comment, so i should be safe, in case i have something leading to the answer. and i'm not going to bother posting my btc address, but it is understood as a gentleman's promise that if my comment helps you solve and get the prize, you will share some with me. Ok here goes:
1) there is a string in the RAW data, i used photoshop to get that string
2) is the filename of the .png important?
3) there are 11-20 words with first letter capital, but most of them are not bip words
how i see this image - it's a wordart/wordle type generated image from the bitcoin whitepaper pdf, on which the bitcoin logo was added in photoshop/illustrator with a whiten/lighten layer effect. These words have not been arranged except that notdef symbol. Even the lambda and infinity symbols must have been generated by the input from the whitepaper pdf by the wordle/word-art software. The angle of the words etc, probably means nothing, it is randomly generated by the wordle software/app, but what the user could have done was change the first letter of certain words.

i'm hoping it drops to $100, so i can buy 1 and hold it till it becomes $1M, 5-10 years from now. I made a huge mistake of not buying 10 when it was $16 a piece back in 2012, instead i gave that money to some idiot in my family. Biggest mistake of my life, i almost hit 'buy' button and then that idiot came to me begging.

Yeah i probably made  one of the best ROI - bought cheap, had to wait the least amount of time for it to double, but my god, if i had held on to those and bought the 10 i almost did, my life wouldbe soooooo different right now. A croatian dude who i met on one of the early amazon like btc sites was totally convinced that a huge war was going to break out, in his region and btc would go through the roof. i should've lostened to him, btc did take off. i rue my missing out every day, i was one of the earliest who saw the potential of btc, but i missed it! damn!!!

Its still very low priced compared to probable future price, theres only going to be 21 million and the corrupt super rich and governments cannot shut it down, it's definitely gonna go up long term no doubt, but yeah, being poor means we list the opportunity to get in around 2014 2015

the designer of bitcoin probably expected bitcoin to be wide-spread enough by the time 21m happens, that the combined processing power of the bitcoin software running on consumers' computers and those who receive (corporations, exchanges) will be more than enough to not need miner computers' processing power anymore. Right now the prize that miners are getting is an incentive for them to provide the processing power that the bitcoin economy requires to ensure quick confirmation of transactions. If 100s of millions or billions of people had coins right now, the miners wouldn't be needed. Also the mining earning system slowly distributes the entire "wealth" around.

@_date: 2013-02-19 23:07:58
Thanks man, i presume you sent some BTC? I can't tell yet as my Bitcoin Wallet is still syncing (since the last 4 hours)
@_date: 2013-02-27 10:05:41
i'm now on 12 mbps and it still loads only 2k blocks a day. 8 days now and still 2.5k blocks pending. I might have set the record for the slowest blockchain download ever. My computer has 3GB RAM but 2GB seems to be permanently occupied by some program/s, can't figure out which. Sign. Gotta let the Wallet finish and see if the problem still exists.
@_date: 2013-02-19 23:35:42
Me too, got 0.002 BTC, which is just like 3 INR (enough for 3 local phone calls) but still thanks a lot BitSprinkle/kuenx for starting me out on my BitCoin jouney
@_date: 2013-02-23 10:33:30
i installed the wallet 5-6 days ago, left the computer on in the night for the first 3 days, and today it still is at just 90%, looks like it will take one more week. This sucks. I'm on 1 mbps net and a 5400 Laptop HDD. This sucks.
