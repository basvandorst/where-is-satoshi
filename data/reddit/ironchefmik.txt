But what you buy with it is less than it was yesterday. I'm all for hodling, but I hate when people make that silly argument. 1 dollar = 1 dollar. 1 chicken nugget = 1 chicken nugget.

First BTC meme I actually laughed at.

1 USD = 1 USD. A dollar today will buy me the same thing as it would a week ago or a week from now.

You pair it with your phone to use your phone's data or pay for a plan for your watch in order not to need the phone

As a completely neutral observer it is funny to see how fanatic some other people are about btc and bch. To the point where it is against their own interest. I have both and only care about what makes me the most money.

They are just dilusional. I bought a burger for the same price yesterday as today. That isn't the case for btc. Obviously there is inflation but let's not pretend that the wild fluctuation in the price of BTC is due to the decrease in the value of the dollar

No app. Their page does scale though in your phone's browser.

GDAX is exactly as secure as Coin base. They are the same company. Is you have a Coinbase login, then you already have a gdax login. GDAX had much smaller fees, Coinbase let's you do instant bus though if you don't have USD already saved. You can transfer your money and crypto back and forth between the two instantly for free.

"Bitcoin doesn't "have to constantly innovate to win," i.e. to keep up with the competition? Then why has its market share declined from 100% to 51% over the years? Newer cryptos offer superior speed, privacy, and platform utility, I would say." - I would agree with this guy. I think it's silly to pretend that the value of a CURRENCY doesn't matter. Even if we take Fiat out of the equation, if no one uses btc to exchange for goods and services what good is it? If I can't go to Lucky's to buy milk with it because the price is unstable. Not needing to innovate doesn't make sense either. I remember it taking hours to move btc to/from my wallet during high trade times. There are plenty of other coins out there to complete with.

They also missed Community

Is it though?

He is making up the 500x. Will it go up? Probably, but first advice I would give someone new is don't trust anyone that thinks they can tell you the future price. As far as how to get started, he is correct in that coinbase is good starting point.

Yes OPs post makes no sense. Also demand plays a tiny role. If I make my own currency called Chefs and I only make 5. Owning one of them doesn't make a difference if no one wants them
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:03:14
Yeah there is definitely alot of that here.  But atleast $1,000,000 will still equal $1,000,000.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:17:41
That makes them even more valuable!

Using OPs logic each one is worth a fortune... Sir, I would like to buy your rocks

I never heard of it before. Saw it at the video rental store
