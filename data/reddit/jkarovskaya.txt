I have lived here for 32 years rent free, which has to be considered as net gain.
The 40 acres of wood land have heated my house and workshops for all this time too, as well as provided lumber for building and furniture.
Quite a worthwhile investment

A house is not always debt slavery.
I bought a small cabin on 5 acres of land in 1985. I rebuilt the cabin, then added on a huge addition to it, refurbished everything in the next few years.  Then I bough 35 more acres adjacent.
I  could sell the house on 5 acres for TEN TIMES what I paid for it   in 2017

Dear GodSpiral:  I, ahem, completely disagree.
Spending US $2000 a month is incredibly easy to do.
Examples  
Better health insurance
Better house/flat/condo 
One nice piece of furniture
One gaming PC
New 70" OLED television
A main stream new car like a Honda Accord Sport is $37,000 
or Volvo S60 for $50,000 could suck that monthly payment easily on a two year note.
Dental care for yourself, or kids ..  ONE root canal plus a crown could easily cost $2000 US.
Kitchen or bath remodeling
Install a home generator
Build a garage, and make $2000 payments on the note
I could spend $2000 more per month  easily  if I wanted to draw off my investments instead of letting them accrue

[I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams](
The last scene in Shawshank was actually shot at this location in the picture, at  Sandy Point, on the island of St Croix, US Virgin Islands
I spent a couple of weeks on St Croix a couple years ago, and it's gorgeous.  Only drawback there is the crime level, and watching where you go as a tourist.
