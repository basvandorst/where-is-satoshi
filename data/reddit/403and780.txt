Holy shit that's crazy. How do people buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:22:28
I'm really really naive to this stuff but I browse r/all sometimes and see you guys pretty often, one of the themes I've noticed here is that Bitcoin is more than just a normal investment and that there's a culture to it which is kind of rebellious against the stranglehold of printed currency. For the user who invested in it but finds themselves in a predicament in life and really very badly needs the (let's say) $10,000 worth of coins that they now have, for rent or medical bills or something, is it very difficult to actually cash out?

I'll check it out, this comment has raised umpteen more questions so I'll definitely have a look there! Thank you!

I did look through them but I'm afraid it seems to be way above my head. I guess I'm wondering like if I had $9,000 in my hand and wanted to apply it to this, what would I get?

I'm dumb about this stuff. What does this mean? ELI5? Is Bitcoin public and it costs $9,000 for one share? Sorry in advance for my stupidity, I do realize these are probably really dumb questions, and thanks in advance for any answers.

Really cool, thanks a lot dude.

Thank you, that's crazy interesting. While I'm sure it's a wonderful problem to have, there must be a lot of you with the predicament of having both made a killing by investing in this but also being in limbo as far as using it is concerned, some people must have some serious money but I imagine you never want to pull it out for fear of it tripling again. Like I said, a really good problem to have!

Honestly this is not on the radar of anyone I know, my local AM talk station had the owner of an Edmonton based Bitcoin business on for a short interview a couple of months ago and that's the closest to home I've ever even heard it mentioned. It's really intriguing though.

So is it literally one bitcoin is worth $9,000 now?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:23:32
I am! Lay it on me!
