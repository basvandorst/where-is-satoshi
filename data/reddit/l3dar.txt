Really happy with this announcement. This is the first step to site wide adoption (expedia) which in turn is contributing and helping us reach mainstream adoption. 
The more ways and opportunities we have to spend bitcoins only fuels the fact it is a currency and is there to be spent. This is also great news as companies such as coinbase, bitpay etc are getting recognized for security, consistency and stability.
Good news all round!

Gox is no longer a relevant market. Do you have bitcoins with them? All I can see is the slow and painful death of an exchange.

There are no issues with BTC-E. Infact, they've been more reliable than the big players over the last 2 days. As I would say with any exchange. Ensure you know everything about them before you deposit your money. Your trusting them with your money so you have the right to know. You wouldn't ask me to hold your money unless you knew me.
Always research before you deposit.

It is a trusted means to buy bitcoins. Find the way you can pay and then the lowest price. Coins are kept in escrow so the seller can't shaft you.

I will update this comment with further infomation about Bitstamp when it becomes available.
**11.26 GMT:** Bitstamp still not connecting for most users.
- Last update on Bitstamps [Twitter]( was on November 18th stating:
" is currently experiencing some problems with our banking software. Thank you for your understanding. 
- Understandable frustration due to Bitstamp not communicating with the public. I am currently trying to get their head office telephone number in the UK to get some more infomation. When I have found that I will update this post as well as other news and speculation surrounding it.
- According to [Coinbase]( the site suffered a DDoS attack. The last time CoinDesk was successfully able to access price data from Bitstamp was 14:05 (GMT)(19th of November).
The site is still experiencing problems. Kodrič said his team is “still working on this” issue.
Kodrič said the site hasn’t experienced any difficulties because of increased user traffic over the past couple of days, during which the bitcoin price has increased sharply.
In fact, the entrepreneur said the site experienced a record number of visits yesterday with no problems."
**11:58 GMT:** Bitstamp appears to be backup - Hoping for a full report on the outages in a PR release to ease my tensions with using them again. Bitstamp fluctuated yesterday like this. Sometimes up, sometimes down. So please be aware of this. Thanks to for making me aware.
- Bitstamp is again blocking out certain IP address blocks. It may work for some but not for someone else. **You should wait until a written statement is made for certain security that Bitstamp is stable.** I'd suggest that you try and trade elsewhere if urgent. If not hold.
**14:04 GMT:** Bitstamp appears to up and running for most. Still no communication from the Bitstamp team.
**15:34 GMT:** I have been trying to contact Bitstamp to try and get an explanation of the recent downtime. How can they expect us to trust and to do business if we don't know at which point they will go down? Crazy. Anyway, I've called quite a lot of companies in the same building as them but they are unable to transfer me. I'm not seeing any down time as this current time. If you have any information please make me aware. 
**18:09 GMT:** "Banking Software Issues: RESOLVED" - Everything should be working fine now guys. It's a shame they couldn't communicate with us. That will more than anything affect their reputation.
**I hope you have all resolved your issues. Thanks for using this post.**

Firstly, read up on for the coins tipped to you. They are being stored in a wallet for you on reddit. You can find your balance out [here]( 
Once you've found your balance you can withdraw using [this]( message. Replace 'ThisIsYourWithdrawBitcoinAddress' with your other wallet address and change  '0 BTC' to the amount of BTC you want to withdraw from your reddit wallet. Once this transaction has completed you will find the amount of BTC you have withdrawn in your wallet on your phone. 
Welcome to the community. If you need anymore help search first on and if you can't find what you was looking for make a post. Best of luck!

These are the issues we face. Currently, the system we use a regulator decides whether or not we should trust a company and do business now. Now we are rolling back to the days of traditional business. Business on a handshake a trust but over the internet. I think like anything the business's that are legitimate will ensure their reputation is not harmed and that they gain good feedback. This was crucial to Silkroads success. The merchants had to ensure they were trusted in order to gain more business.
However, we must not forget that we do this in fiat too. Just not on this risk scale.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:14:42
Thats the million dollar question. The problem with all these exchanges is that they arent communicating to their customers very well. CoinFloor being one of them. I think the last time they updated an outlet was Nov 8th. 
Is it to much to ask for communication?

I don't understand what point your making. Everyone who is invested into bitcoin should know the principles of supply and demand.
No one knows whats going to happen to the silkroad coins but a sell of would be a big dip in price thus allowing a lot more people (who are at the ready) to enter the bitcoin market which would buy the coins sold.

@_date: 2013-11-20 09:27:57
In the coming months a lot more people will be adopting BTC.  When the market stabilizes and people aren't scared to spend their coins or mBTC without missing out. There will be huge opportunity for payment processing companies to make money likewise small merchants and they all need a method of payment. Competition is good for other companies. Look at Bitpay, if all goes well they will be the first billion dollar bitcoin company. 
They need to understand the potential, understand the risks and weigh into whether or not they want to miss the boat.
There is a lot of money to be made after all it is a currency and not a commodity or stock. It runs on economy. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:33:55
This is exactly why the first person (people) to build an exchange that it fast, effective and secure will be millionaires. They can't seem to get it right. The amount of money they must be making you think they'd hire some more people. Not just bob and joe with pre-k education. 
Let's see where it takes us!

Firstly, don't expect it for at least a week. Even 2 weeks. If it's that small, just forget about it and then the next time you look at your bank statement you will think you have a present. Don't threat. You will receive it!
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:50:16
Just for ease:


The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each is divisible by up to 10^8.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:41:07
I understand what your saying and it's obviously viable. However, looking how volatile the market is at this moment in time is stopping people from spending at any level. If you spend 1BTC for a PS4 paying 450$ and it rises up to 700$ a BTC you've essentially lost out.
This is stopping the bitcoin economy from working. Hoarding coins to make a millionaire over night. Sadly, this is not the case.
edit: why would I be down voted for stating the obvious?

1. is bitcoin legal in Canada? 
   - Bit coin is legal in all countries at this current time (20/11/2013)
2. Is bitcoin hard on a computer? 
  - Yes and No. You have different wallets. Some online, some offline. Online ones are deemed less secure therefore people use it as a 'hot wallet'. Usually this is a very minimal amount. Software wallets/paperwallets is were people store big value. More so paper wallets.
3. I read that litecoin you can mine faster so would it be worth while to mine litecoin?
 - Litecoin is currently a small value of USD. It is worth mining Litecoin to gain an understanding of how the process works. Who knows how Litecoin will evolve. My prediction is that people will store value and hold with BTC and trade with LTC.
Hope this helps. If you have any questions I will try and answer them!

It is definitely worth trying. This is the perfect time for alternative exchanges to bounce and win the trust and business from many. 
As long as you can provide the following you will be successful:
- Security
- Stability
- Trust
- Communication
These are the four key attributes I look for in an exchange. Ensure your not just running it from your laptop. You will need capitol for secure servers. I couldn't trust a guy with a laptop holding my hard earned money.
If you have any questions or need any feedback just drop me a PM.

I didn't think silkroad would be impacting the market at this point. Just look at the comments, not a lot of people are educated on bitcoin:
- "One fine day many people are going to bite their coins and find them fakes."
- "is everyone blind? a drug dealer could buy bitcoins. wait a while then cash them in. easy peasy clean money. next you will see the olson twins cash in their bitcoins for new Ferrari's . Woops, I mean winklevoss."
- "I have a nice bridge in Brooklyn for sale. If any Bitcoin buyers are interested in bidding on the bridge I only accept US Dollars."

I hope your right. But again we can't predict this market. We can't use historical data to our advantage and we don't quite know what effect news/announcements will have on the price.
It's easy to make hyperbole surrounding bitcoin - but we must remember tomorrow it could drop to 0$. Let's be optimistic but grounded in our approach. We need to believe in bitcoin as a currency of buying and selling not just making money on the market.

No - Because if Bitcoin is adopted as a worldwide currency that means 7 billion people will have access to it and only 21 million coins. That's a heck of a lot for a coin.
