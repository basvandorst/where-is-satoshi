I wonder if they're taking advantage of the benefits of using the Lightning Network ��

What is the name of this restaurant??

There are also platforms like Opennode.co or BTCPay Server that will provide the solution directly to the merchants, coming very soon :) 
Whether you are technically literate or somewhat technically illiterate, both platforms provide the solution you're looking for.

In terms of the smoothest experience for both you and your customers, you should look into [OpenNode]( 
Instant payments, multiple e-commerce integrations, and instant bitcoin exchanges to fiat.

You should check out [
They provide a Bitcoin (on-chain &amp; Lightning) merchant solution with instant fiat conversion built into the platform.  It's super easy to setup on any laptop, smartphone, or tablet and only takes minutes to get started. The [quick invoice]( feature is a great solution for an in-store Bitcoin POS. You also can integrate directly into your online sales through a simple API or you can create payment buttons/links with their [custom checkout]( feature.

Suggest switching to [OpenNode](opennode.com) In terms of the smoothest experience for both the merchant and customers, OpenNode is killing it. 
Instant payments, multiple e-commerce integrations, and instant bitcoin exchanges to fiat.

For sure the best stickers you can buy using the Lightning Network
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:35:03
Yes, it is. 
it shows that you’re committed to changing the current corrupt system. 
That’s the problem though, this isn’t supposed to be about buying crypto and exchanging to fiat when the price is good for you. 
Every other coin spins off the speculators dream and thrives off people pumping them as “the next bitcoin”. You “worked” for these companies, you don’t work there anymore so you’re insight is irrelevant &amp; you don’t even own any crypto?
gg though,
I’ll follow back when ebay accepts crypto

I never claimed that I understand as much as the devs leading the charge but I do understand you can't put a hold on innovation.  It may not be to scale yet, but that comes with due time and using testnet coins till then won't prove anything.  
  
why would these companies commit to any other crypto than BTC, besides the fact that running the lightning network that can and will handle millions to billions of transactions per hour, BTC transaction fees are already under 2$ a transaction..
nah but I'll raise your bet and call.
I bet you were probably invested in Bitconnect.

If you're open to discussing this idea more in detail, send me a private message.  I'm down to bounce around some ideas and see if me or my team can help !
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:06:27
These "Big" companies you're thinking about are already trying to adapt the technology, it's not a question about if, it's when &amp; if they still want to remain a big company or not and accept another form of payment.
Bitcoin is already usable.. example: Lightning network.
Why would they possibly need to commit to accepting (other crypto) when it may be years before it is usable, and in fact may never be usable. lolz
I bet you like bigger block sizes huh?
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:29:10
ahhh so you're a nocoiner,
it all makes sense now.
 you shouldn't speak for other "Big Companies" when you don't even own any crypto to speak for yourself.
happy to hear you're excited for the innovation though.

either way, I'm trying to gather anyone who would be interested in creating applications on the bitcoin blockchain and on multi layer solutions
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:13:48
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:12:10
that's a cool idea, you should check out OpenNode.co too, their fees are reasonable and have a good UI :)
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:12:41
Correct !
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:47:02
it works great through OpenNode
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:10:23
That's amazing &amp; yes mass adoption begins on the merchant side so thank you!.  Check out Opennode.co they offer a very simple way to start accepting bitcoin with Lightning. :)
