Yes I had emailed them. They gave me a canned response that all of the security checks are the reason it takes so long. I followed up yesterday with them. I'm just now a bit weary that they have my card details and I've yet to do any kind of business with them.

The card I linked was a simple bank debit card w/ Visa logo if that makes a diff. What did you use?

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with OP. I personally couldn't be any more pleased that Bitcoin has moved past the "crypto anarchy" phase and is now starting to be taken more seriously as a viable financial instrument. I actually look forward to more institutional investors getting on board to both further legitimize the currency and catapult its price to new highs

This is both fortunate and unfortunate

Will he eat his ass if Ethereum hits 200k?
Edit: Is this real?

I hardly click articles from MSM anymore, especially left-leaning outlets such as The Guardian. While this managed to get one or two little digs in, it largely stayed true to the topic at hand. But I really hate the term "crypto anarchy", and it's obnoxious how they tied it to "right wing populism". Decent article nonetheless though.

I hear so much about the 'hash advantage' if you will, yet am a bit unclear on it? Can you possibly ELI5 or point me to an external resource ?

I want to read the article but am hesitant to waste my time on another "blame Trump" diatribe. Can anyone confirm or deny?
