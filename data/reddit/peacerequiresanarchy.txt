Open borders.
Of course, individuals don't have the power to open borders, but they can on their own choose to use bitcoin, so I think Marc Andreessen wins.

Extend that graph about one more year and you get world GDP. Even if bitcoin is as wildly successful as the most optimistic people hope, it doesn't seem plausible that the growth rate would stay that high all the way until it is adopted by everybody (or most of everybody).

**Recommendation for Optional Security Feature**
Allow users to optionally input their email address when buying bitcoins. This will send the code to their email rather than display it on the screen.
**Why this feature is needed**
People concerned that someone might take a picture of the screen on the ATM while they are attempting to write down their code may want to do this. Also, if you accidentally write down the code incorrectly or if you accidentally press the asterisk before taking a picture of the code or before copying down the code, then you no longer have a way to get the bitcoins you paid for. Also, sending the code to your email makes it so you don't have to write down the code or take a picture of it. Lastly, even if someone accidentally deletes their email with the code there can be an option on the website where you input your email address and it resends the code. So this method is fool proof--As long as you type in your email correctly. To make it completely fool proof, the machine can give you a code too that works after a certain period of time (say 7 days) if nobody claims the money using the email address code. So if you accidentally type in a nonexistent email address then you'll still be able to get your money using the code displayed on the screen, after the period of time is up.

I've known about bitcoin since July-ish 2011 (although I've kept relatively quiet about it with my friends and don't own any yet). For the first time today I saw a stranger checking the price of bitcoin. I was in a computer lab and the kid in front of me opens up [bitcoinity]( in his browser and I was like, "Whoa!" Nothing like your story, but I was surprised nevertheless.
It's no longer just the internet or finance / tech people.

Or maybe he's saying it because he means it and it's the only moral advice. Why do you doubt him?

Is this not an ATM?:

No. So few people would believe that the price could go up 10 times overnight (and stay anywhere near there) that they would sell before then anticipating a crash and/or wait until an expected crash to buy in and the price would increase more slowly. (Well okay, my explanation for *why* the price wouldn't increase that fast is probably wrong in several senses, but you get my point.)
Although, now that you bring this up, what is the largest BTC price increase that has ever occurred in a 24-hour period (say, since BTC reached $1, since I assume the most rapid growth appeared very early on))?

So wonderful.
After knowing about bitcoins for two years and being fascinated by them as a libertarian it shockingly took me until yesterday to choose to get a wallet. I finally did so through the bitcointip blockchain service after seeing someone give a great, well-deserved tip.
I'm so thankful for all of the knowledge I have gained from kind anonymous strangers on the internet that I would love to be able to thank them. There's finally a way I can: Tuesday (the next day the bank is open) I am going to walk down to Bank of America and use cash to buy my first bitcoins through cashintocoins.com.

If Schiff were to secretly invest in the bitcoin then he'd be putting himself in a win-win situation: Either he gains more popularity for being right or else he makes a lot of money when he's wrong. Then again, if he thinks it definitely isn't going anywhere then he doesn't have a good reason to invest.

You're welcome! The 25mBTC was worth $21.80 at the time, so I could have taken out my debit card and gotten a slight discount. I probably would have if the price was any higher, but I wanted to learn what it was like use bitcoin to buy something--my first purchase! Incredible how easy it is.

I just bought a $20 Steam wallet code from  for 25mBTC. It took 8 minutes from me sending payment to get the code emailed to me.

He flipped himself. Of course what the Feds did to him was morally wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that he shouldn't have gotten involved in the black market in the first place if he wasn't completely certain that he would be able to resist accepting the government's offer to rat others out in order to be less-severely punished.

Presumably the people who [donated]( their bitcoin to you did so on condition that this was true. If you were lying (e.g. if you just made it recently in an attempt to scam people into sympathetically giving you bitcoins), then you are guilty of fraud and owe the donors their bitcoins back.
Of course, judging by your reputation on Reddit, I assume you are honest.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:14:19
I don't think that that is implied.

But is that kind of behavior necessary in order to keep one's risk of becoming the victim of theft or another kind of attack low?
The Winklevoss twins publicized their large bitcoin investment. Presumably they found a way to do it safely--or are you calling them foolish?

As expected.
