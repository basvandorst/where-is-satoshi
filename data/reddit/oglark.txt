Maybe you should read a trading book. If you follow a basic trading strategy for a commodity you will make more money than hodl'ing.

Okay. Although high minded your vision does not make sense. At its heart, a currency is the transfer of value. There has to be a reference for its value. At one point in time this was barter (which is essentially labor). As occupations began to diversify, it became a precious metal as a standard for a basket of common goods. Eventually, this moved to private banks notesvand then to nation-states who became the standard. 
 At the moment bitcoin's value is referenced to fiat currency. In fact, Satoshi's vision has not come to pass yet. Right now cryptocurrencies are a speculative investment vehicle. The vision was this will be a currency which people will buy things with and supplant normal currency. 
Right now all I hear is "to the moon" on This is obviously unstable and not the original purpose. There will be an inflection point where cryptocurrencies actually become currency.
EDIT: Sorry I meant to add that everyone creating his own cryptocurrency will not work because there is no reference for "exchange of value". We can already create our own currencies - adding crypto does not change it.

Uh. Being the longest chain does not make it the most secure. It is not like the encryption becomes better as the block chain gets longer. That is fundamentally incorrect.You should read the white paper, or maybe just read how encryption works in general. 
There are a few developments in storing, encrypting and distributing the ledger which may overtake block chains in the long run. 
The only advantage of being the oldest chain is that has been attacked the most so it is unlikely that there are any significant vulnerabilities left. But that does not mean that there aren't any.

Christmas Day 2018 =$1.50
New Year's Day 2019 = $150,000.00
I might have underestimated the volatility. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:51:17
This is true. The amount of hoops I have to jump through proving my money is my money when doing transfers is pretty ridiculous.

Panic and sell!!

That is not totally true. He made a large bet on Black-Scholes being wrong once.

It's nice to see that you can fail high-school and still create a meme post that 1200 other people who failed high-school can upvote .

I think people misunderstand risk.

Why is everyone calling this a bear market? Bitcoin is an alternate store of value not an investment or a get rich quick scheme. It has been remarkably stable within a band for the past 9 months.  It is finally achieving its original mission.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:30:58
I am not sure I understand.  Let us say you sold @ 10k (the exit for a lot of people) in Dec 2019. In March you buy for 4k. You pocket 6k in profit and can buy more when you rebuy. Am I crazy?

Why didn't you use the app?
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:14:01
This is stupid. If you thin BTC is going to keep going down, sell the majority. When you think it is going to stadt rising buy it at lower cost.

Tesla sued and lost. Twice.  
  
Top Gear is scripted but the first gen Roadster was a kludge that Tesla used to find the lessons for the Model S.   And any car (ICE or BEV) that is driven hard on the track is going to have a degraded range; they just emphasized the charging time. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:00:52
They did not misjudge Tesla; the Model S did not exist. The review of the Roadster was fair: they loved the straight line speed, panned the handling in the corners (the Roadster batteries are not in the bottom of the car so the Roadster sloshes) and criticized the charging time. The worst thing they did was mention the long tailpipe fallacy and then state that hydrogen would be the future. But in December 2008 no one knew which way the market would go, or that Tesla would advance BEV design so far.
I would invite you to watch the review of the Roadster on YouTube before jumping on Top Gear  because you are attacking them without having seen the episode. They didn't lie and Tesla got a lot of free publicity out of both the episode and the lawsuit.

Well the HODLers kind of got less exuberant. It's a bit hard when your two week HODL looks like pure brilliance versus the pain of  sticking it out for the long run.
When it hits 25k the memes will be back

Amazon has been profitable for years. And it always lost money on a small scale compared to its growth. Tesla, is by all realistic standards, $100/share overvalued. It is an amazing company but I cannot see it ever being bigger than Apple or GM. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:23:36
Am I the only one who is a little disappointed with this volatility? I would much prefer a constant 25% increase in BTC every year than this yo-yo meme generating behavior.
The entire point of Bitcoin was to make it a safe store of your money independant of Government monetary and fiscal policy: just like highly liquid gold. Right now it's an Asian currency manipulator fiat and get rich fast kids looking for 1000% returns.
Anyway I will just keep DCA buying.

Doesn't matter, any country where it is preferable to fill in your swimming pool rather than pay tax has bigger issues than Swiss Bank accounts
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:03:07
But the point of Bitcoin was that it was supposed to be  a stable source of value to prevent Governments from destroying wealth through currency manipulation. Bitcoin will work when it is like gold, valuable yes but not volatile. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:37:23
Yes, keep on believing that. Or maybe buy a book on technical trading and learn to see patterns.
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:59:43
So, instead of selling in January for $8500 and rebuying at $3500, which would allow you to buy more BTC, you held it all the way down.
  
Congratulations.
