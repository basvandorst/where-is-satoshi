ETH wasn't always the most profitable thing to mine. You'd could clear $30/day in the 6 months leading up to the peak. I know because I built no less than a dozen rigs in mid 2017.

The short answer is: No
Assuming those are S9s pulling 1350 watts each at 14th/s and assuming a 0% pool fee, at his current rates he's making 41 cents per S9 per day. This doesn't include any other overhead, rent, cooling, maintenance, or hardware costs.
Even if his power was free, All the hardware pictured would only make $45/day. A year and a half ago, you could make that much with an 8 card 1070 rig in your basement, easy.

Because no one wants to pay over market value, unless you have some reason you don't want the exchange knowing who you are eg. You're a criminal and have cash and no bank account, otherwise it makes no sense to overpay 10-20% for bitcoin.

Because you can lie to yourself all you want just not to me. The reality is mining is not the most profitable thing to be doing right now. You can explain your electric rate til you're blue in the face. What are you gonna do when the next halvening happens? Just hope btc is over 10k?

I hear this argument all the time, and it's no less stupid than every other time someone else has suggested it.  
Let me break out the crayons and explain opportunity cost to you real quick.  
If you invest your money into BTC instead of hardware to mine it, your upside is so much higher than it is if you were to mine it  


Well it's barley profitable and he'd be better off taking a loss selling the hardware he has and buying BTC directly, especially if everyone operates under the assumption that new all time highs aren't more than the lifetime of the hardware-years off. But I'll have to break out the crayons for him to explain how sunk costs work.

Right, it just robs you **during** because it charges a huge mark-up on the price plus additional fees.
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:09:06
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:51:18
I get the convenience argument, but no one goes from not knowing a thing about crypto to "I want to buy BTC this fucking second and I don't care how much I overpay for it"  
And the "but its so volatile" argument is irrelevant especially considering a vast majority of people are in it for the money, not for novelty.  
Signing up for an exchange is not a difficult process, neither is getting verified. Some don't even require KYC unless you purchase over a certain amount.   


That's just the fees, that doesn't include the price markup on the BTC itself.  
But lets ignore all of that. So Joe Rando buys some bitcoin at an ATM using your logic. He overpays for the BTC plus fees, because he's an impatient little twat. He holds on to it for a period of time and it's back up to say 20k. Oh no, BTC is crashing again, fast. So he wants to sell, but because he never signed up for an exchange, he has to go to a BTC ATM to cash out, only when he gets there, the ATM has a line of people trying to do the same thing, or the ATM is out of service. So because Joe Rando was an impatient fuck that wanted it fast instead of smart.

So by your own numbers, each S9 is making $2.35 per day
$0.057(electric rate)\*1.35(kw/h)\*24(hours in a day) = $1.85 (electric cost per S9 per day)
Which means you're making 50 cents profit/S9/day
I originally stated according to coinwarz you were making \~$0.41/S9/day which isn't that far off considering I acknowledged coinwarz round your electric rate up 0.3 cents. When you factor in your other costs. $0.41/S9/day is pretty fucking accurate, if anything else, it's quite generous.

That's not the point. Good journalism isn't based on trust, It's based on objectively verifiable reporting of facts. If it can't be independently proven then why the fuck should anyone believe the Hill says, about a tweet from some guy at WaPo, about a summary of a Fox interview, that I can't find Assange saying what these "journalists" purport him saying.  
But you're really giving me shit about not trusting what a journalist said, about a summary what another journalist tweeted, about another outlet's interview that can't be properly sourced, linked, or cited?

This was reported by Aaron Blake of the Washington Post... he is the source, not Assange. Show me where Assange said "the intel we have on Donald Trump pales in comparison to the billionaire’s own rhetoric"
the origin of the quote is still unknown  
 It appears that theHill quoted a tweet of a Washington Post employee who was summarizing the Fox interview

If there's no underlying crime, how can there be obstruction? Firing the head of the FBI is perfectly within Trump's right and is not obstruction. Based on McCabe's senate testimony, firing Comey in no way hindered the FBI's investigation.  
 The President [has held the power to appoint and dismiss the director of the FBI]( at his or her discretion since 1968
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:41:56
The Hill quoted a tweet from a WaPo reporter that summarized a Fox news interview (with Assange I presume).  
This is so diluted at this point, without proof it actually came out of Assange's mouth, I see no reason to entertain this assertion based on 4th-hand hearsay churnalism nonsense

It is his choice, but not his responsibility. He knew full well the possible repercussions of his actions
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:23:03
So are you suggesting Mueller, who made how many indictments, simply chose not to decide either way on this one thing, and you think it's somehow open to interpretation? While ignoring the known, objective evidence against it being obstruction on the mere speculation there may be something buried in the Mueller report somewhere?  


That's the wrong question to ask... the correct one is What would exonerate him?

I know math can be hard for some...
