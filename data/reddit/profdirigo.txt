Wow so much bullshit and lies to unpack. I'll just stick with two. One bill C16 is a blatant attack of freespeech. That is not disputable, and that's his point regardless of how the legal community currently interprets the law. 
two. Calling his claim that hyper focus on idenity during the 20th century. Which was the basis of Nazism and communism invetiably lead to the Holocaust "apologia". Is a lie and utterly facile. He's warning that current focus on identitarianism leads to that inevitably. He says that often. Analyzing the factors that lead to an event is not apologizing for it, it's seeking to prevent a repeat. 
Any time someone tries to attack him it's apparent they're grasping at straws. Similar to how modern progressives attack bill Maher and Sam Harris. Typically requires lying about something they said. 
Here's my criticism of Peterson: he's just not that interesting or brilliant. Beyond that there's not much more than progressives overreacting to mundane things he says.

In acadmia recently universities have had to withdraw studies because they've offended progressives. Also the  "Sokal Squared" scandal shows how utterly corrupt academia is by left wing political theory. So there's some basis to criticizing the left. 
But between a religious republican and a normal liberal Democrat. The liberal Democrat is going to be more focused on facts assuming he or she doesn't have to appeal to nonsensical views to get votes.
