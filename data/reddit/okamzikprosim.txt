At the moment of browsing it, I am. My permanent residence is in the US, but I'm currently temporarily abroad on business. I'm not logged in either, so that would explain it.

When I click the link my terms are totally different. No reason to downvote me, I'm literally seeing something different. I just checked again.

It doesn't specifically say that.

If Circle doesn't charge a fee, how do they make money other than angel/VC investors? It doesn't seem sustainable as it is with it's current offerings. Am I missing something?

Also, cats.

I'm amazed you are actually getting 47 cents. Guess you don't bank at the big guys (who constantly screw you over).

Interesting. I've used this in Prague on Vodafone before and never realized the Premium SMS fees were so high. I probably never even noticed them to be honest. Mostly because I wasn't paying attention.

Still doesn't make it legitimate. It's not even covered in [DPMB press releases]( If the bus agency was involved, wouldn't they want to make it a big deal?

I am not Czech, however I have lived there for extended periods of time for work (not Brno though), however just because a website references cityhack doesn't mean it is automatically legit, but maybe I am a skeptic.
Shouldn't DPMB mention it on their website if it is a payment option? Until DPMB references it, I don't think it should necessarily be trusted. With SMS jizdenky, the only way to verify it is authentic is through a fare inspector. Why risk a more substantial fine when you can pay in cash?

That website doesn't look official at all. There is NO mention on the [official website]( at all.
How can it be known this isn't a scam?

No, sadly I am not.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:44:03
Have you been stopped by a fare inspector?

I will change my comment again.
