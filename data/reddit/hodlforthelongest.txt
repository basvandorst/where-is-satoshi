What I'm wondering about is what is going to be "lending policy". 
Eg. when I put 1BTC on my side of a channel, and my "hub" puts 0BTC seems all good. But then after I pay 0.5BTC over the channel, HUB has 0.5BTC locked in the channel, that technically belong to it, but which they can't use. Should I be paying anything for it? If so, how much and when?

First, we don't have to do it that often. We need maybe a handful. And sidechains are free to implement fees within the system, etc. The free market will decide if they are worth using. If there's a sidechain that implements $0.01 transactions, I might move some BTC there for quick spending etc. and pay, balancing with the main chain from time to time.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:05:26
Supply is fixed, demand is elastic. Price off fees will set the balance. What can't fit on the main chain will be done on sidechains and LN.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:52:54
Why would they be doing it in the first place?
If I was to write such system, I would made it use the newly received coins to pay the outgoing transactions. Is that the case here?

@_date: 2018-01-12 16:13:41






AFAIK, It was a somewhat arbitrary number. It was picked to be 4, as it gives us an effective block size increase of 2x.
It could have been done eg. as 8, decresing to 4 with time. That would give higher incentive to use and support SegWit to initial adopters, and gradually revert to desired block size when the legacy transactions are no longer filling the chain.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:58:19
We would have more than a double transaction count with 100% segwit. Obviously, at this point, people would fill any capacity provided, but due to how transactions fees are distributed, it would bring the average cost of transactions somewhat down.

No worries. I'm trying to actually confirm if the P2SH-P2PKH (`3...` addresses) are actually discounted or does it only apply to P2WPKH (`bc...`), but I'm reasonably sure they both are (since we already see 10% segwit utilization, and they are called segwit etc.)

They do matter in near term. Exchanges are an on-ramp that brings value from the "real world" to the currencies by allowing people to buy and sell them.
At some pints believers are dwarfed in terms of economic power, by "regular folks" and it will be much harder to achieve our non-price goals if we have to compete with well pumped centralized and bank-coins.
I am not much worried, but I think we could use this as a lesson for the future: if we want embrace new features that benefit everyone, we need to give some solid incentives to self-serving parties to use them.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:54:36
It's mostly about storage and network, and the fact that increasing block size 2 times, makes everything 4 times more resource consuming.
But sure. If technology goes forward, we will keep increasing the block size. It's inevitable anyway. However, right now, we have software improvements that increase the efficiency, so we try to push in that direction. And SegWit **does** increase the blocksize, for people that actually use it.
So we do companies and users not use SegWit? Because it turns out that 1000 satoshis per byte on blockchain is still cheap enough for them. And if blockchain was 2, 4, 8 MBytes, it wouldn't change. They and other applications would fill the blockchain anyway, putting the costs of resources needed to run the network on everyone.
That's why for normal users it's important to look for solutions that use the blockchain ver, very rarely - only to settle other transactions. Sidechain and Lightning Networks are exactly like that.
In a half a year, you will be moving your small BTC transactions on Rootstock chain, and LN, and only once in a year balance things with your "savings account on the main blockchain".

`libzbarjni.so` has multiple versions as any software project, and anyone can compile it from source (which is probably a good idea anyway) and then it will be a bit different too.
I would ask developers about source of this files, etc.

Part of the reason why I would not trust any software wallet with any bigger amounts.

@_date: 2018-01-03 18:39:39
The block size increase part that was accompanying segwit, was based on discounting witness part of transactions in the block-size calculation by dy dividing it by 4. That was supposed to give an incentive to use SegWit and was based on the fact that segregated witness can now be easily removed with time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:00:52
Why? Isn't it kind of pointless? If they have spare mining power, why wouldn't they use it at all times? They don't seem to be mining BCH at the same time, so what's the point? Every time they increase the difficulty they make it harder to do it again in the future.
I mean... we want all the miners to hash as fast as possible at all times, right?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:19:35
Bigger transactions will be still cheaper on the main chain (because the cost is fixed, vs percent of the transaction). And any funds on LN are pretty much instantly available to transfer on main chain (it's just closing the channel needlessly is a bit of a waste).
So the way I see it there will be a fluid balance between them: the main chain will still be always full, but whatever can't be done on main chain, or is too frequent and need to be instant will be on LN.

I am not concerned about that actually. They were able to manipulate other markets because they are opaque, or what they've manipulated has  a real-world implications and/or is inflexible in nature.
Bitcoin is translucent enough, easy to own and transport so it's not stored in vaults like gold, and serves no practical utitlity (which is the good part!). Trying to buy all the Bitcoin just raises the price. Noone is going to starve, revolt or be held hostage by BTC shortage etc. Dumping Bitcoin requires owning it first, and just lowers it's price. No biggy. I think we're going to be fine.

The USB thing is not enough because more stuff needs to be taken care of.
It's all basics. I'm assuming relatively small operation. &lt;10 BTC. For bigger and more funded node, I would do stuff more professionally (more expensively).
Hardware: a PC in a reasonable shape, UPS (so that power outages etc. don't kill your box), possibly two ISP connection (so that network outages don't shut down your service).
Download Ubuntu image from the official site, check the signature, double check if you downloaded legit Ubuntu image. Use that to install an Ubuntu on a dedicated hardware box that you keep physically in secure location.
Make sure to enable disk encryption during installation. In case anyone breaks in and steal your stuff, they will have to decrypt the drives.
Use long and random passwords for everything. Store offline and securely.
First thing, disable all unneccessary services, and block all incoming traffic on all ports, on both UDP, TCP, on both IPV4 and IPV6 using ufw/iptables.
As a rule of thumb, don't ever install or enable any software on that box. Basically don't do anything that is not strictly neccessary.
Install a and setup some legit, open source VPN software with a decent plan (~$10/mo) and configure so that all network traffic goes through it. Use firewall to block any traffic on that VPN, except for ports that LN actually needs. Both incomming and outgoing.
Install Open Source VirtualBox, and the same Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine. The reason why we want to run everything in  aVM, is that it's easy to maintain, take live backups and eg. copy over to another box, if the current hardware starts misbehaving. It will also make the software running inside it be unaware that is running in a VPN, so it won't be able compromise the real IPs etc.
Inside that VM, setup your LN setup. I never did that, so I'm not sure how exactly, but the Dockerfile posted in this thread should be a good description.
Use `nmap` to double check if all ports are blocked, and only LN ports are visible on the external VPN address. Basically you want the node to appear like it is running "in a cloud", while physically running in your location, and not tell anyone where it is really running. And you want any network traffic totally blocked, except for LN. This way you're not making yourself a target.
Setup automated backups! Take snapshots of the whole VM, copy it over to additional disk drive. You can use PGP to encrypt it with a public key and send over the network to a different location (Amazon S3 or something). In case your house gets flooded or burns in the fire, you will be able to restore everything from the backup that you can decrypt.
Ledger Nano / Yubikeys do support hardware GPG keys. I'd recommend using that - makes a lot of stuff easier.
You might want to keep a spare PC, with a same setup ready, in case the box breaks, and you want to quickly resume your node operation.
Keep your Ubuntu up to date.
And that's pretty much it. I know there is plenty of details involved here, but they are not particularily complex for any reasonably experienced Linux user.

Registered, pending verification. Coinbase won't ever see my money again.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:03:21
Then the VM host has to be secure. :)
I think the best setup would be a Docker image with a network namespace that enforces it going through some VPN that forwards only neccessary TCP ports. This image running on a plain, up to date, clean minimum Ubuntu on a physical host under your own control.
I actually work professionally in security. If you ever need any security consultation (free of charge, but no time comitments) PM me, and I can provide my real name and credentials if you promise to keep them for yourself.

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:04:21
Coinbase is incompetent but allowing the coin we dislike so much is a suicide. It might destroy it and trigger the next crypto crash, just like MtGox did. Look.
Bitcoin hashing power is around 12-15TH/s. The other coin that uses it is 1-1.5TH. And they use the same algo.
Which means you need maybe 15% of Bitcoins mining power to reliably double spend on the weaker coin. So now that there is a bigger market for the weak coin, any pool can start mining it in secret, send weaker coins to Coinbase, sell them, transfer BTC and other coins outside, and publish the new, now longer weak-coin-blockchain. Kaboom - someone got free money from Coinbase, while it's users are thinking they are holding something. Millions, millions of dollars lost, and Coinbase and their users are holding a bag. Panic. Coinbase gets DDoSed by users trying to withdraw whatever they can.
It takes maybe 1 hour. You could probably do it even with rented mining power. It is 100% reliable. Noone is going to know you're attempting it, until you pull the trigger. And after the trigger - how do you know who did it? You can't! While you're at it, you can kick BitPay too and buy yourself some nice shiny things and get your old coins back. Especially if this attack is carried for hours, it might be devastating. And attacker can see how much ahead they are, while defenders have no idea. You can safely pull the trigger whenever you're done.
On top of it, the danger is always there. The first mining pool to do it, is going to win. It might be already happening this very moment. Any time Bitcoins mining power dips, it might be a pool trying to do it. In fact, V-er and J-i-han can do it any moment without a sweat - I mean, they own the weaker chain mining anyway. After they offload the coins they accumulated, they pull the last trigger. V-er won't cry after Coinbase, just like he didn't cry after MtGox. I wouldn't be surprised if he knew that MtGox was insolvent, and used it to time everything right. That's how he got so rich.
History does not always repeat itself, but sure as hell, it does rhyme.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:19:24
That's a wrong way to look at it.
99% of users already go through exchanges back and forth and gave them their ID.
No one is forced to go through exchanges. But if people that already did, wouldn't use-up blockchain resources, we would have more room for people that don't want to give their IDs to anyone.
I doesn't have to be all or nothing. It can't be. LN has very good privacy properties anyway, and can offload huge amount of tiny transactions from the blockchain. It is great for everyone - even people that under no circumastnace would use LN.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:49:48
I also doubt $1000 per transaction. But $50-$100... I could see it happening. And peer-to-peer does not define who the peer has to be. Sure, it would be nice if it was "every single human on the planet". But we're not there yet. I could set-up a payment channel with my employer for $50/year, same with my broker, and my "bank" (LN HUB). That would cover 90% of people that I can want to do transactions with anyway. I don't give up custody of my funds, and I get most of the benefits of an on-chain transaction plus some more. And if you've seen OpenTransactions, one could have checks, anonymous payments, etc off-chain on top of that too.


Sure, but which one? That's the point. Alt-coins are just a poor-man off-chain transaction systems with faster and cheaper transaction, but much lower security, market depth, etc. And they are all revolving around Bitcoin anyway. If they compromise security for throughput too much, then they will easy to shut-down as soon as some government deems them too popular. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:21:54
To expand: LN transactions are percentage based, which means there is always a number where on-chain is cheaper than LN. 0.01% from 1MM is $100, so it's better to do it for $50 on the main blockchain.
So LN and blockchain will ballance each other, and not really compete.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:33:16
The difficulty on the public chain will start going down, sure, it is being mined with 49% power. But the secret chain is being mined with 51% power, so it also goes down the same way.
Difficulty adjustment help to cope with a sudden surge or disappearance of mining power but doesn't do anything about 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:27:14

@_date: 2017-12-29 23:22:47
It's past busy Christmas time and I really doubt there's much for them to gain now. Users are getting better and better with fee estimation and moving to LN. I suspect I'll be doing sub-$1 transactions soon no matter what the miners do. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:32:12
You are just repeating yourself. :D That is not adding any information to the discussion. If you're right I'd like to know why.
0.1% fee from $1MM is $1000, so I woudl rather pay $100 on the main chain to transfer it. Plus it would be a lot of funds locked in a channel, and would require same capacity on every channel it is being routed through.
That is why, it seems to me, that big transfers will still go through the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:20:22
LN is making Bitcoin less centralized. It gives incentives to run full nodes, it allows offloading small and frequent transactions from the main chain, it has good privacy properties, and LN being somewhat centralized is harmless.


You can still use on-chain! What is so hard to understand about it? You don't have to use LN, even if you fear it, and the fact that some people will, makes more room for you.
I'm done talking with you. You can worry all you want. :D


I can read your profile history. Funny enough, whenever someone can't understand the simplest ideras about LN, and throws invalid argument around, it is a big-blocker holding BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:46:44
You're right with the first paragraph.
After attacker is done it broadcast all new blocks from the (no longer secret) longest chain. There is no "solution to a block on main chain". There is a whole new chain that is longer.


It is not the difficulty that has to be bigger. It is a number of blocks (work) that has to be bigger. Longer chain = more work was put into it = must be the right one.
Maybe that would be helpfull:
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:16:49
The rules of the protocol are such that the longest chain is the valid one. Miners automatically switch to the longest chain whenever they notice it. Otherwise, they would be losing money, trying to mine on a chain that has no chance be the longest. Rough miner doesn't have to convince anyone. If it can mine the longest chain by itself in secret, everyone will accept it as soon as it's published.
The secret chain would be just slightly longer than the public one. The difficulty would be roughly the same, and all the timestamps etc. would fit just fine.

Copying into a comment:
The reason why Bitcoin fees are high is that it transmits huge sums of money. The following is the chart of total USD value of transactions sent using it (and a couple of altcoins for comparison).
Despite the high fees, Bitcoin is **the** cryptocurrency and it works as intended. It's just the smaller fishes, have been priced out of the blockchain, and need to wait for LN. It sucks, I know, but just because you can't afford something, doesn't mean it is not working.
If you look at:  and compare "transaction volume in million USD" and "Fees" on the linear scale, there current period is on the expensive side, but not that much, and there have been times in the past when sending $1MM on BTC blockchain costed more in USD terms than now.
Smaller transactions have moved to altcoins. Mostly ETH, which seems to be the king of dust transactions.
as you can see BCH is quite high on "Median Transaction Value", despite being barely visible on "number of Transactions" graph. What does it mean? There are just handful of BCH whales moving their piles of it. That kind of proves that most of "social media chatter about BCH" is artificial. If BCH was so popular and awesome, then more people would use it, especially that fees there are so low. Instead some whales are pushing their speculative agenda and trying to pump and dump at every opportunity with piles of their overpriced coins, that their acquired from people that dumped them.
Real small users seem to use mostly Dash, LTC and ETH, in order of total "transaction value", while BTC is for now reserved for rich people, some of which were made rich, by holding BTC, and some of which are just entering the market with piles of fiat.
I highly recommend everyone to keep following the stats like that and make their own conclusions. If I got something wrong, or you have different interpretations, I am very interested to hear them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:33:29
I would be more interested in a more real-life setup: with many HUBs.
Eg. Exchanges are a natural hub points for LN. They generate the majority of the traffic on the chain and it would be in everyone's best interest to run these through LN. It would make exchanges have more traffic and liquidity.
Also, there will be some Tor-enabled central HUBs for the paranoid.
Overlapping with that centralized HUBs network there will be smaller, but more decentralized network

Please be aware that the host system must be secure, for that docker image to be secure. Docker gives some protection for the outside from the inside attacks, but in this use case, it is the inside that needs to be protected.
Still, this will greatly improve number of users that can setup small LN node themselves. One can setup a fresh Ubuntu, add firewall, VPN, install that docker image and they will be ready to go.

Do the math. It takes $100k/hour (in lost BTC revenue) to double-spend the BCH chain and it takes just 5-10% Bitcoin mining power. Now that so many exchanges are trading it, there are millions to be taken for whoever does it first. How many millions do you think one could trade on all the exchanges at once for a day? It takes $2MM to do it for the whole day. It's a perfect crime because it is not even a crime.
Someone is going to do it. I would bet on it. And exchanges that support BCH are going to get royally fucked. Their users are going to get MtGoxed again.
If I got anything wrong, please let me know.
Best part is: Bitmain&amp;Ver&amp;Co can do it even easier, any time when they decide it's a best time to dump their coins. A Coinbase is stupid and naive enough get rekt by them because they think they can make more money on trading. Haha.

On top of it - where did your mom get this paper wallet? Did she print it herself, or purchased online? If online, it is not good. Somebody else has your key! Swipe it and send to your own phone wallet while you still can and throw that paper away.

Frankly, because comparing to 12.5BTC reward for mining a block, a couple of $10 transactions don't make a big difference to miners.

I live in a densely populated area. Anything like that happens, I'm dead. The best case scenario is that I'm eating my neighbours. I have more important things to worry about at that point. :D

It isn't valid at all. 
You don't have to use LN. Or you can use it over Tor with an anonymous Hub.
LN HUB can't freeze or steal your money. There is literally no drawbacks of LN - worst case scenario is it not going to work as well as expected. Unlike big blocks that are forcing externalities onto everyone.
You are complaining about nothing, probably because you hold bcash and shilling. You don't mind mining and node centralization on bcash, but will invent thousands excuses to complain about LN.

Does it practically work?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:29:32
Routing failed: fees too high no route found that would have balances to complete it.

2020? This chain will be nuked in 2018:  if not this year.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:35:32
It's not mandatory. But it would be greatly beneficial for everyone if it happened.  We would immediately see a lot of free room on the main chain, so even people that don't want to use LN, benefit. If it won't happen, than adoption will be just slower, and network LN will grow slower.

LN is faster than reddit comments. :D

You're very helpful.

Yes, . Actually, BTC price doesn't even matter that much.
I have perfected my attack, and I think it can be done with 5% of BTC mining power (or less).
The idea is - since BCH mining difficulty is a weighted moving average of 144 last blocks, one can direct some small mining power to BCH chain, and mine at a very slight loss. Just enough for other miners to leave for a while to mine BTC. It can be done smoothly within 24h hours, probably less than that at little cost - you are earning BCH after all. There is a peak point somewhere in the middle of that 24 hours, where difficulty starts to ramp up, and a lot of mining power will leave at once: just like it is happening already and why BCH blocks have longer gaps and are choppy sometimes. Now you fork in secret, and start mining. As soon as you have a decent head-start (two blocks), you send your BCH everywhere and start trading. You do in everywhere that trades BCH. Changelly, Shapeshift are especially good since you don't need anything there, and they are using underlying exchanges to do the swapping. You can do it on some personal and suck-puppet accounts too - there is no proof of anything. You can always say you were arbitraging. You don't bank accounts etc. You have 4-8 hours before the weighted average starts going down again.
The total cost of BTC you didn't mine is like $70k per hour of the attack (5% of the 1.5MM/hour mining payout rate) . A steal. How much can you double spend in couple of hours? Fat millions on all the exchanges trading BCH. I'm sure I'm not the only one that have this figured out, and I will be very surprised if it will not be done. On top of that you can short BCH somewhere on margin to amplify your payouts.
If someone sees it and thinks it is worth discussing, please repost, since I was shadowbanned by our stupid automatic censorship system.

And there's a point in it. If Bitcoin transaction costs $1000 that means Bitcoin is hugely successful: a world reserve currency. And Bitcoin native chain users are not people, but institutions and countries, while layer-2 solutions are ubiquitous. Anyone that was holding 1BTC, is a multi-millionaire in dollar terms.
Is this really a failure?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:55:58
You're right. Thank you for correcting me. But in this attack, if you've mined the longest chain, the fastest, you did put the most work into it, and you will have the highest total difficulty.
The distinction here would be important if someone was mining in secret slowly, to decrease the difficulty a lot, and used the change in difficulty to start mining new blocks at a rapid pace.

I think a Linux LiveCD, that you can boot your computer with, and that will firewall everything, and display an address to send your coins to would be an awesome thing.
Interested users could create a LN node very quickly, fund it and earn interest on fees just like that, and it wouldn't be that easy to break into.

Yes. Some of them might be merge-minined though.

I'm putting on my tinfoil hat...
What if it was another VerCoin purchase trying to screw some people over?
