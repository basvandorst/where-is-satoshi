You're not seeing the point, sure there are great breeders, but there are also myriad terrible breeders who only care about making profit. That's the inevitable result of people paying for dogs.
Nobody is saying there aren't good breeders.

I never mentioned that I'm advocating for rescue dogs.
Be it my business or not, I love all animals and if I see that someone isn't aware of the side-effect of their actions, the least I can do is point them out.
I will see to it that inflicting pain to any animal will be my business, directly or not.

Please do NOT BUY DOGS, it creates a market for them and attracts businesses that will not always treat the dogs the way they deserve! 
If you love dogs like I do, adopt them instead!

Because they impact other innocent animals. Some people just don't see pass their own nose, or they just don't care.

Oh cool, a certified inbred dog!

Nah, that's their issue what they do to their own body, everybody can do what they like to themselves, even take their own life. 
The fact that they are supporting the exploitative market of enslaving and slaughtering over 50 billion animals a year for the sake of taste or tradition, yeah, I might have something to say about that. I don't empathize only with animals that have some utility to me or that are cute.
So yeah, they should know where their food comes from and how its made, which I guarantee you most people do not.
