did u keep telling yourself this at december?

In that case, trigger an explosion where youve buried it strong enough to catapult it into space :) dw the safe can withstand the explosion although your house may not :(

What is the IRS? Never heard of them? Perhaps youll consider declaring these bitcoins in the future to the tax man so you dont get in big trouble :)

Make a copy onto a paper sized piece of gold, lock it up in a water, fire, bulletproof and air tight safe. Next bury that safe 500m below ground underneath your house (that way cyclones n stuff cant steal your coins). Afterwards pour concrete into the hole youve created and done :)

I reckon everyone's gonna run scared when governments worldwide regulate tf outta bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:10:21
