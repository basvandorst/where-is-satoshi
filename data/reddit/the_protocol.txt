Well let's look at it this way:
 In order for a massive spike in BTC price relative to fiat, there will have to be more support and liquidity with Bitcoin market to fiat than there is currently. The reason behind this is because any 'investor' who is utilizing BTC for strictly cheap transaction fees or the hopes that it will gain in comparison to fiat over a short term (or even long term), has to be able to exit the market if they so choose. 
I will attempt to explain the reasoning behind bitcoin bubbles, and why they will continue. 
I feel Psychology plays a HUGE role in BTC adoption, and it's not always one entity, one news article, or whatever that decide to begin buying.
Party_A = New adopters + Party_C
Party_B = future adopters
Party_C = adopters since previous stagnation
Party_D = General population outside of BTC space
 * Step 1: Party_A decides BTC is undervalued based on several factors including, but not limited to:
           - the advantages over fiat
           - current influx of venture capital
           - innovations in the space
           
* Step 2: Party_B sees Party_A's move into the space and decides to follow suit based on the sheer fact that the price is rising in comparison to fiat, in hopes to gain fiat on the other side
* Step 3: Party_A has obtained what they set out to obtain
* Step 5: BTC to fiat ratio plummets due to sells by Party_B and Party_D under the assumption Party_A has discovered a 'problem' with BTC since they were the earlier adopters and are obviously quicker at obtaining this knowledge.
* Step 6: Party_B exits the space, either gaining or losing fiat
* Step 7: Price begins to stagnate over the course of time, with only Party_C in the market
* Step 8: During this time of stagnation, Party_A coordinates with Party_C and soon become Party_C 
* Step 9: Party_C continues to grow and develop the space (this year it's merchant adoption for the purpose of providing more liquidity for the exponential growth of Party_B, and the amount of Party_D who will jump on, then jump off)
* Step 10: Party_C hits new innovation, Party_A is created from Party_C, sections of Party_D and (hopefully most of the) Party_B
* Step 11: Repeat
If you want to know what will create party_B this year, I believe it will be the leaked price of the marshall auction in combination with Winklevoss ETF.

better get ready. big, off-exchange trades are harder to come by now with all of the markets. When people start buying up the order books, it's all systems-go
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:02:03
I believe you are mostly correct on that. See my latest post
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:27:31
I believe you're correct. This is my second time hearing this prediction.
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:21:24
I'm actually using Party_D not as the greater fool, but those who have no motive to understand BTC or have not yet come across the Bitcoin space.

Uh, Austin? ..duh

Once the price paid is leaked, which was obviously at a premium -- if not, people would be boasting "BITCOIN is dead" everywhere. They were sold at a premium. Let the speculation build from previous investors, then leak the price; would hit news, etc. Avg. Joe over here "Hey guys bitcoin is worth 900$ this site is selling them at 650!." IMO, there is no bad outcome from this austion

Well, as I see it, the Bitcoin ecomony will ultimately be divided into two segments. In the future we will not have millionaires, billionaires, etc. We will most likely catagorize (even if we change denominations) into left siders and right siders. Those on the left side of the decimal place, and those on the right side.

thin order books or not, ~150BTC isn't a small amount any longer

Next few weeks* 
First off: It doesn't matter what BTC / USD is. EVER. The fact that it has any worth at all in the eyes of people with federal reserve notes shows for a fact that it's begun the network effect over fiat money. The innovators dillema was a problem with Bitcoin. Fed notes are so widely used that the primary issue with mainstream / laggard adoption is people opening their eyes to legitamicy without the 'hurr durr virtual scams'. No government ever used their own hands to prove its validity until the marshal auction. The Federal Government sealed their own fate by offering these up to the public via auction. If and when there is a price leak, it will be the perfect 'news' to cioncide with the chart. 
Even if you're not the biggest believer in T.A. you should be able to understand exponents and metcalfe's law. The amount of money being shoveled into the bitcoin space this year was more than enough to 'pump' the price. What we are seeing now is a building of solid structure throughout the cryptoconemy so that when it does begin to saturate the masses, the economy will not collapse. And friend, for 6K a BTC, we have more than enough pieces in place. When it begins to retract down from 6K back to 1.5Kish, you will see SO many reposts of the same shit we've seen for years. 
Past may not predict future, but what we are seeing here is an adoption curve by people with differing technological inclination. It just so happens that it takes roughly the same time for each distinct class of intelligence to figure out what they're missing. 
The news is only to mask the fact that BTC adoption has, and always will follow the same trend. The media knows what's up.

Yes. I only have the BTC I trade online. The rest is in cold storage. I lost some in GOX, lost some in Cryptorush.in, lost some from various mining pools. Trust NO ONE. Hide your coins, and hide them safely. Soon, people will go extreme lengths for small amounts of BTC. Better safe than sorry
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:21:42
as someone relatively new to Austin, I second this
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:10:29
I did not claim I was of any intelligence. But it holds true for me as well. Just because I lost some BTC, does not mean I do not support it. I simply had some online for trading and, well, I lost some when the exchanges went under. Your arguement is invalid, as I was using myself to help someone learn. You have to make mistakes to learn, friend.

lol why are you trying to scare the kids?

somebody doesn't understand apodtion curves in markets without regional / cultural restrictions. i.e. language
