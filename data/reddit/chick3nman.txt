I might be able to help you with this, I've helped several other people. PM me.

I just offered to help OP and pointed him at so we could discuss it in a more appropriate place than in I don't see anything wrong with that. It's a legitimate offer and I've helped plenty of other people with the same issue so I thought I'd make an effort to seek out those who could use the help. Sorry if that offends you?
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:10:11
Oh awesome, that's perfect. If you want to send me the info needed, I can go ahead and get started. I've not really had any problems with it under normal use, only when I branch into things like russian characters does it start to freak out a bit.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:58:58
Um.. Ok? I'm not sure what you mean by shill in this case but w/e.

If you still need help with this, PM me or post it over in I've broken Electrum wallet passwords, it's not really that hard.
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:20:39
There are prebuilt tools that can handle electrum wallets, I use them a fair amount. I'd suggest looking into  as it's one of the easiest to use and faster ones available in this case and it may end up faster than your script. Also if you or are unable to recover the password, I'd be willing to give it a shot as well. I've done electrum and other wallets for a few redditors before and this is what i do essentially as a job(password cracking) so I have a fair amount of hardware to throw around to get things done faster.

If you still need help with this, I've done multibit and multibitHD wallets before. PM me or post this over in and I can help you break the password on the wallet.

Is python 2.7 installed on your system? It should be pretty easy to install. Go to the python website and install 2.7.11(needed for the bsdb3 package which was dropped in 2.7.12 as far as I know). After installing that, go download pywallet, navigate to the folder, and simply run "python pywallet --web" to start the local web interface.

Using the tool PyWallet you should be able to read the addresses and see if there is any money in it.

It should be possible to manually look into the database that hive keeps and read the private keys. I'm not familiar with that wallet specifically but there's a chance a tool like pywallet can make sense of the wallet files you have.
@_date: 2016-11-18 05:26:31
Before you start messing with it, back it up in a safe place. I'm looking at the Bitcoinkit stuff and I still don't see any export commands for private keys. Will probably need to figure out how everything is stored and read and do it manually if it's not a built in function. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:28:15
Yeah that's not an uncommon issue. I believe you simply need to add python to your path. This tutorial will fix that issue pretty easily: 
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:24:10
Yeah, I searched for people who had the same issue. That's the part where I was seeking people out who I could help. Still not sure whats wrong with that.

I may actually be able to help you with this, I've cracked several blockchain.info account passwords for other redditors. PM me.

Open a cmd prompt in the same directory (Shift+right click in the folder, open cmd here) and simply type "python pywallet --web". 
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:19:50
You can simply install python and run the webgui with 1 command. It's very simple and everything after that is done via the web page. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:53:12
Try "python pywallet.py --web" the command is "python [path_to_script] (arguments for script)" 
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:38:28
I can help you with this, I've helped several other redditors get back into blockchain.info accounts. PM me or post this over in and I'll see what I can do.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:22:21
If it has a password, it may very well be possible to break it, I do it fairly often for people. PM me and I may be able to help you. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 19:16:42
It's actually not that hard. What format is your wallet in? If you want, you can PM me and I can help you. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 00:28:04
Do you know which bitcoin2john version you are using? I've been able to extract hashes from recent wallets just fine. Also have you looked at the hash extraction scripts in BTCRecover? 
@_date: 2016-10-06 01:31:23
You can't get a JTR or Hashcat formatted hash from that very easily so you will need to use btcrecover. I can do it for you, I'm already setup for it. Or I can help you use btcrecover if you would like.
@_date: 2016-10-06 01:21:07
That base64 string is the hash, It's not useless. Can you post what it extracts? Should start with an uppcase Y if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:09:23
I can possibly help you with this. PM me so I can get some more info about the situation.
