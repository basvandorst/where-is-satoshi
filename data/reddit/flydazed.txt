What’s BA?
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:21:20
Well, this is what I was talking about.
However, I am all fine except this electricity thing. I keep em on a balcony where it’s super cool right now and they work absolutely fine.

Aye, I will just show you.
This is what I get.
This is what I have set.

Alright amiga, I bought your app, it’s really great and I will definitely use it in a future if you will improve a couple of things.
1. Make it faster! So, I was using a CoinDesk app before and it was doing its job about telling me btc price. I come in, it’s right there. Instantly. You need to do the same or you’ll lose to free apps. Here is a short video for a better understanding 
As you can see, coindesk does it fast and it has one home screen for only one currency. I understand why it takes so much time for your app to load - lots of cryptos to show. So maybe you make a home screen with only one currency. Or like in a Weather iOS app. You choose 2 cities and it shows a weather in a first one on your home screen, you swipe and there is a second city with a forecast. So, something like this. I am not interested in anything except 2 cryptos, I don’t wanna see 100 of others. In my opinion it’s a good idea to keep this screen with 10s of other cryptos but do not make it a home screen. Well, you got my point.
2. Widget. I always use widgets. For the weather, for the currency rates, for the traffic, news, everything. And I wish some btc app would have a nice widget. Most of widgets are ugly, if they have one (usually not). So it’s going to be your good and big advantage if you make one.
3. CENTRALIZE THE GOD DAMN LOADING WHEEL-THING-WHATEVERITIS. My inner rage is growing freaking fast when I see this biased to the right loading wheel����.
It’s a not a deal-breaker but... just a wish
4. Graphs. To many bugs there. 
Watch this: 
You can move along the graph. That’s good. But once you’ve done it, you cannot move a pin. You can only move the graph. Just make it so: wanna move a pin - 1 finger, wanna move a graph - 2 fingers. 
Another bug is scaling. I guess it’s a feature to tap twice and a graph will scale but it’s bugged. I tap twice it’s scaling down where it’s only black and white and no graph. I have to swipe it back up. 
Make the pin smaller. It’s too big and wide for such a small graph.
5. Add an option of change theme. Maybe to black/white or smth else. I think not everyone will like black/gold.
6. Thresholds alerts. If current price is $11,500 for example. I set the alert BTC&lt;$12,000. It starts sending me notifications like “THRESHOLD CROSSED 11732.7” and then the same but $1 up. Is it supposed to be working this way?
Oh, and change the format of digits showing. E.g. from 11732.7 to $11,732.7. Looks more... legit, idk
I think that’s all I’ve noticed so far. 
I will rate your app 5 stars and I hope you will change those things. Cause right now you are honestly losing to some free apps. But if you will improve those things your app will worth its price. So I trust you won’t give it up.
And personally, I am glad to see you doing such a great things in your age. You have a great future ;)

AH, my fault. Wrong link. 
But I described everything anyway
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:00:23
Oh, and you can think about iPad and Apple Watch app for the future.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:36:41
NO SHIT MAN
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:27:31
Yeah, you can see it on a screenshot.
One is IF over 12k
One is IF below 11k
One is just at 9 am
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:36:18
Wow, thank you
If you have a job offer, I am ready ������
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:29:13
I have never seen such offers but thank you, I will consider :D
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:28:12
Well, this is what I am right now and has some knowledge and experience. If I would be into jewelry for example, I would come up with some jewelry related business idea in suitable subreddit  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
