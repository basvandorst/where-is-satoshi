What country are they going to attack to stop it. Whats that , war on bitcoin. Worked really well for the war on drugs. 
I am not saying you are wrong , and tbh this is the million dollar question I have been wondering for a while. When it comes time and governments really want to step on bitcoin , how do they do it.
