Changed the medium article subtitle from “plain English” to “(relatively) plain English” :) sorry if that was misleading.
The target audience is people who know and understand something about the space, and want to understand more, but not yet ready to read the Lightning whitepaper. I was one of those people myself and I know many many more. For example, if you managed to learn something new - I think my goal is reached ;)

Yeah, I know the story. But to be honest, I think if people understood LN better, that FUD would not work. Hence I wrote this article :) I will think how to better reformulate the phrase when I have time.

Probably not the most accurate wording (that is why I write “can say”), but good for intuition. They are fully formed transactions and they can be broadcasted at any time (I explicitly clarify that later), but they represent how much participants owe each other, and in this sense they are similar to IOUs.

And after ~10 months of operation, we sent exactly zero e-mails, because we respect people’s time. And if that is not enough - the e-mail field is optional ;)

The capacity indeed stays the same (this is what is written in the first part of the sentence you cite). But it is not exactly equal to the sum of balances because of the commit_fee (which is an on-chain fee to be payed when the channel closes).

No worries and thanks for the comment, I will rewrite this paragraph to be less confusing
