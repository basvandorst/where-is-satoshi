I had a similar run in with these guys, just run a mile and don't look back.

Thanks for the link.
Ah so the preimage is never revealed, that makes more sense :)

After thinking about your reply, I do see the parallels with the classic student T test.
So as the number of keys (samples) increases the uncertainty of the underling population decreases.
But I guess the schnorr signature is still stronger than the original keys as it would be more resistance to a straight forward dictionary attack? Even if the attacker can be more confident in the distribution of letters more closely matches that of the underlying language.

Thanks for the Great presentation and some really interesting ideas.
So the state chain entity controls 1 of the keys for a multisig transaction (say 2 of n) and co-signs with the sender?
Each new recipient can add their private key as valid for the 2 of n and can therefor spend the coins?
Can the state chain entity hold the funds hostage?

Hi hueydane,
You are close, I would like to use the pub key as a timestamp to prove that some one was near a particular device at a given time while they are offline.
I was worried that if someone had a series of say 10 pub keys and knows the pattern of the nonces that they could use this to calculated an earlier pub key.
In hind-insight and sobriety, 
If the hashing algo is good (which it is), this should be good enough to protect against someone generating older pub keys.
But I am still not certain!

Hi nullc,
Thanks for your reply, I should stay off reddit while drunk. 
For the use case; 
I would like to use the pub key as a timestamp to prove that some one was near a particular device at a given time while they are offline.
 
People would claim a reward by moving a small amount btc to the pub key on the device when they found it.
I could use a one time pad to do this, but I though it would easier to lean on btc infrastructure instead of creating a secure website etc from scratch.
From the little I understand, there is no requirement for the nonce to be either random or secret when generating keys.
Either way, I think I have over complicated this, as it would be better to calculate all the pub keys separately and then load them on the device with some code to update the displayed pub key once every hour.

Hi almkglor,
Thanks so much for this awesome reply.
I am still new to bitcoin so it might take me a while to get this together, but I will kept you update on how this works out.
Thanks again!

I need to give small repeated payments in exchange for real world data verification.
The payments are small \~10c so I have to keep them off chain, but the recipient should be able to claim the sum of the payments when ever they choose.
I know  pubkey and the data that is to be collected so I can calculate the hash before hand. 
I was going to construct a series of P2SH transactions and publish them off chain (by email/website)
When the recipient collected the correct data they would be able to sign the highest value transaction to release the funds.
but as i\_gotta\_say pointed out once they have the private key and hash they can make a new transaction and empty my account. :(
I think maybe I am trying too hard, and maybe I should stick with a standard 2 of 2 multisig, but then the recipient would need to wait for me to verify the hash and sign the transaction.

The spread on a round trip Eur-BTC-Eur is \~4%. Which is 300eur per btc at the moment. 
Also there is a limit how often you can use their their "free" exchange.
