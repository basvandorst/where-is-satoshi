Care to explain how bitcoin solves the double spending problem then? I don't think you have any clue of what you're talking about.

Should I remind you that the Byzantine general’s problem isn’t solved by math? It is solved through “economic incentive to achieve consensus” and like it or not consensus requires humans to agree with each other’s. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:15:12
They will leave it in the dust the day they will realise the bitcoin blockchain doesn't scale. They already don't care about the coin so they won't bother long with it.

Is it OK to have too big to fail insolvent banks?
@_date: 2015-09-06 04:05:59
Nope. Unless you will buy $10M or so worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-08 00:03:06
Miners resources are already scarce in terms of electricity, bandwidth, hardware which already ensure a fee market to take place. The efficienty of these resources alocation is subject to be improved because miners are in competition which is good for the network. Why add an artificial scarcity on the blocksize which will empede miners competitive environment?

How do you make a profit?
@_date: 2015-09-09 00:24:45
As far as I know there is no consensus for the status quo.
@_date: 2015-09-19 14:14:06
Why is that?
@_date: 2015-09-07 19:50:45


No it's not. Stop pretending so.

Why would anyone want to use the internet if it loses its decentralization and trustless properties because you need big ISPs? 
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:12:43
Sorry but I fail to see how *invalidating* transactions scales anything. Proper scaling = validating more transactions. Not the other way around. It does not scale anything.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:56:41


And how a blockchain which has the purpose of having almost no transactions/usage will stay safe? It's the exact opposite. The higher potential transaction volumes, the higher potential fees there is to collect. Miners will go where the money is and there is no guarantee they will stay on the main chain. It jeopardize incredibly the security of the blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:03:38
Big companies need capacity.... who would have thought!?
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:53:43

And how can I use it again? 
@_date: 2015-09-13 05:00:43
I don't see why anyone would use these features if bitcoin scales properly.

Then don't reply at all if your not going to make any argument. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:16:42
Huh? I don't recall any bitcoin businesses saying such a thing. Do you have any example? 
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:09:10
Fractional lending was illigal before the last 300 or so years you ignorant chucklefuck. You should get yourself a history book. It is also currently illigal in most middle East countries. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 22:29:25


It's an observation AFAIC.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:16:24
TIL bitcoin has become a centralized currency. Gotcha.
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:24:55
There is no reason to think that scaling the blockchain, which will requires greater hardware capacity, will centralize bitcoin to a point it will become something else. There is NOTHING to support this assumption. There is an incentive for users, miners and businesses to run full nodes at lowest cost possible. The market will come up with solutions for these issues. Decentralization =! being able to run a node of my phone.
The drama around BIP101 and XT is greatly overblown.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:48:21
This is very possible and has been done by banks in the past. A 100% ratio doesn't imply you can't lend it out. It means you can't lend more than what you have. Doesn't that makes perfect sense to you?
@_date: 2015-09-24 03:50:57
Which part of "bitcoin is still an experiment" you didn't get?

The five authoritarian devs don't give a damn about a large portion who are getting sick of their consensus blockage status quo. That's how I see it.

You need to verify your account, transfer money and buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-06 22:23:34
Not at all. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:28:31
So? How is this making it less true?
@_date: 2015-09-14 21:44:51
If you don't want bitcoin to worth 0.50$ you should worry.
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:04:54
Hearn forget that there is/will be plenty of blockchains competing to get market shares of what bitcoin couldn't get.  The fees will never rise to a point only criminals will use it. The fees will rise just enough to give an economic incentive for almost ALL market participants to move to another blockchain that scales better and is much cheaper to use. That blockchain will take off to the mainstream and govs won't be able to shut it down. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 02:53:14
OB should launch somewhere around December. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:03:50
Nowhere it is written that they don't care about the coin. Have you even read them?
@_date: 2015-09-05 16:19:46
Of course you can do fractional reserve with anything but since the blockchain allows proof of reserve, why someone with half of a brain would deposit his bitcoin in an entity that is insolvant by default? Would you?
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:03:24
This is just the first iteration of these kind of devices  We should give the market a chance to evolve and adapt. The incentives are well aligned.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:17:25
There is an incentives for running nodes at low cost so the market will monetise on that. How is this misaligned?
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:42:01
That's a potential trade off yes but I am sure the free market will come up with solutions to keep running full nodes at cheap cost since there is an incentive for that. Either for individuals, businesses or miners.
@_date: 2015-09-12 20:34:39
What are the incentives for miners to do such an attack?
@_date: 2015-09-30 03:58:34
It is just a matter of time before another blockchain that scales better than bitcoin really takes off. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:54:30
Nodes are already a public loss and will always be. I don't understand the point your trying to make.
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:57:50
The question is, who will accept a bitcoin bank note unregonisable by the bitcoin network? Maybe some fool but certainly not me. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 03:54:55
And if the blockchain doesn't scale quick they won't care about both like any other same businesses. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 00:20:24
What are the gains right now for non mining nodes? There is already no monetary gains for these nodes so I don't understand how removing/keeping the limit would change any of this.
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:52:42
These idiots are probably big businesses that need bitcoin to scale to scale their operations. Ignoring market signals is what I call idiotic. Core does seem very good at doing this though. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:44:41
Define "rush it". You can't expect the $1G invested already to wait forever that bitcoin scales either. Time is money and at some point either they make money or leave the space.
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:53:41
I hope you realise that it is so trivial to put code in the wild that it will happen again right?
If you think this is any kind of a threat you'd better opt out now.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:04:00
Not sure why you are being downvoted. This is exactly what happened with the 2008 bailout.

 So much potential damage for such a weak system!
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:38:50
If they can handle it than yes. I don't see why not.

The market can't be in conflict of interest with its tool. A single actor can though AKA Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:08:44
XT gained traction because it fitted the views of a fairly large amount of market participant. Who writes open code isn't releavent. It happened now and will happen again, don't fool yourself. Especially when the market will become larger and participants will have even more diametrical and disperced views.

You can watch the **Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies Online Course** youtube channel:
@_date: 2015-10-07 16:36:16
Right. No one with a right mind would invest money to create a business around a technology that shows no signs of being able to scale in a timely manner. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 18:36:58
Transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:29:27
There is a difference between voluntary off-chain transactions for whatever purposes and *forcing* transactions to go off-chain. Forcing transactions to go offchain should be considered as an attack on miners profits, yes. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:07:36
Unless the block size is not increased...
@_date: 2015-10-02 04:31:48
Blockstream. Just in case you didn't noticed. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 16:31:38
You sleep well at night thanks to your government that bail out banks with magic money when shit hits the fan. Otherwise your money would go bust with that bank. Are you comfortable with the concept of too big to fail banks that doesn't have to manage risks because the public will pay eitherway?
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:20:23
You can still lend money with a 100% full reserve bank just like banks were doing in the beginning when it first started with gold. Of course it means not every one have access to their money at the same time but the bank remain 100% solvent.

Wrong it was John Matonis. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:53:56
Good enough decentralization is good enough. Stop the FUD.
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:21:25


So why Core devs are trying to force people out of the bitcoin blockchain to these offchain solutions? 
@_date: 2015-10-02 04:17:07
Bitcoin Core is not really threatening anything with its 1 mb blocks. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:25:00
I guess good enough decentralization is good enough and trying to get as much nodes as possible at all cost might simply be unnecessary. The hard question though is how much nodes is needed to have good enough decentralization? How to measure the minimum nodes requirements to get as much on chain transaction as possible so the blockchain can be as competitive as possible? Letting the free market decides might be an easier way to define that.
@_date: 2015-10-01 01:46:47
Good for you. I am personally looking forward the next competitive blockchain that scales properly to buy its coin. Too bad its not bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:59:40
@_date: 2015-10-07 16:34:10


It's the other way around. Higher prices generates higher transaction volumes therefore generates bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:23:05
Yes if you are in Canada
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:36:30
Might happen someday.
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:42:33
Making it expansive and uncompetitive to use the main chain will just drive users away driving down  the main chain usage. This is not desirable neither for users and miners. I'm not convinced the fees on main chain *can* be driven up to a certain point without hurting the whole protocol relevance. The main chain should remain competitive. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:15:09
I didn't but the link seems broken.
