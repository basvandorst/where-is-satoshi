UNO community is always savvy to exchange risk ...  ... so far UNO continues to be the 'withdraw option' with 5 other markets to resell for BTC if that's what you need.

I think localbitcoins might be the decentalized exchange we've all been waiting for.  Oddly here already.
What about finance?  Any V.C. projects?  Why not list a crypto asset for crowd funding a major expansion/upgrade/promotion?

Well 'The Big One" can have lawyers argue what is an "An act of concealing" in regards to Magical Internet Money for years and years.  Plus 80% of the btc community buys the story that haxors got the coins.  LOL
The whole time the 800k of satoshi dust keeps blowing across the block chain. 
Tux has the keys, and unlike a bank account, no court order is going to freeze these funds.

Not really.  No one checks to see if you voted X then you get paid $.
If the senator losses then all WV participants will just happen to benefit by gaining BTC. 
If I offered you a few dollars of BTC in 2010 you'd thumb your nose?

worth repeating.  the above settle contractual obligations in the Eyes of the Law.  gold, silver = okay if both agree. FR Note = LEGALLY done if offered. 
alternative currency = something people commonly exchange with one  another = anything of common value examples  .. baseball cards, books, beanie babies, bottles of wine, art, glass beads

Why not a public "GTFO u php SOB NOW!" ?  nope.  Let's go down to the pub a wait for this to all blow over.
And now...  = 0 tweets  ever 
BF why not say something like this when the Gox spread was much higher than all the other exchanges:

So it begins.  Want bitcoin?  Then provide gov. ID and proof of residence.         Then blockchain can follow the flow of money trail from there.  
The majors are doing their best to lead the conversation to this outcome.
--&gt;   Only big "corp" juristic persons can play the BTC market ... for everyone else you can buy on a markup from 'retail' coin dealers.  
NEXT STEP
non"cleared" coins won't be allowed to be traded, therefore no one will buy on the street "cuz they might be dirt coins you know".
TLDR;  BTC is being captured and turned into a 'wall st' securitized product.

*just an idea* 
Let's not forget about Sen Joe Manchin aka Senator JP Morgan ... why not a bitcoin PAC ... but let's simplify the process ... we donate to a open account (under Escrow). 
We promise every West Virginian (who registers a bit address) that if Manchin loses they get paid.  
Not "Let's support the other Guy" ... that's too complex/political/regulated/controlled ... the fact that the PAC exists will get the needed press/buzz ... Joe goes and you get paid WV!

The 4 silly arguments against FORKING bitcoin.
1. Consensus
2. What the hell?
3. Really Gavin is bitcoin?
4. Fork off!
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:53:09
Forking is the wrong answer.
Gavin is free to create Gavin coin.  It can be a snap shot of BTC and merge mined like Name or UNO or iX.
*The answer is if you use BTC you pay higher fees to get the transaction in quicker.  That is the original model.*   
All the dust transactions will just move to the dreaded ALT coin networks.  BTC will be an elite 'big transaction' network.

LOT as in lottery
more than happy to act as investor token (ledger of capital gains) ... and yes the pot/payout would be BTC
