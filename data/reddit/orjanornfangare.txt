James is fucking stupid for putting money in a bank as an investment. If James read up a bit on investments he'd buy stocks/bonds instead. Banks are good for lending money and keeping basic money for survival.

Well that's a fucking stupid argument that you often hear here by the bright minds of By the same logic you can say that gold only has the value that we think it has. Just because it's a shiny yellow metal doesn't mean it has an intrinsic value of x0 000$ per kg.

Not sure if serious but being liberal correlates extremely hard with how educated you are, and yes including natural sciences. I mastered in computer science and industrial engineering and I'd say at least 75% of people would be what you americans refer to as liberals.
Being conservative correlates strongly with being poor, uneducated and illiterate.

Or maybe it's just the case that when you're educated enough, you can see through the morally rotten lies that one party is trying to feed you. You can call us elites if you want, but it's not some grand conspiracy, it's a simple correlation that education -&gt; not republican, and illiteracy, being poor and unemployed -&gt; republican.

Yeah but it was not fair competition since you didn't allow blacks to have the same jobs, and women weren't really participating in the workforce in the same way either. The adjusted salary might have gone down for white men in america, but that's just because it's been distributed to women and blacks as well.

I've been shorting bitcoin a lot, and I think it's one of the best trading opportunities on the market. Hopefully this is the beginning of another bubble so more sweet shorting opportunities arise.

Most large investors don't want to be invested in crypto, like everything large investors is not a homogenous group. And it honestly does not matter who invests in it, nothing can escape the pull from underlying value. Unless large scale adoption happens, bitcoin will never be successful. Yes, Rome was not built in a day, but facebook and most other technology companies went from nothing 10 years ago to billions of users today. Bitcoin has went from 0 users, to maybe a couple of hundred who actually use it in their every day life. I don't see that changing in the future either, which leaves the only conclusion that Bitcoin will never stabilise at a high price.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:10:31

You nailed it, past performance doesn't mean anything. It takes significantly more money to pump it up next time, and I don't think we'll ever have another pump of that size. So yes I do think the expected value is negative. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:22:00
That's not correct :) The EV becomes +0.02xN, ie +2%. According to your formula a coinflip for double-or-nothing (0.5x2xN-0.5xN) would have a value of 0, ie 100% loss which obviously is incorrect!
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:00:44
I'm not trying to come across as intelligent, what words did I use to make you think that? Either way, to have explosive growth in the price, there needs to be explosive growth in adaption. I don't see that happening for reasons I've already described.

Just dont put all your retirement money in bitcoin. If it fails and keeps falling as the years progress (which I with an economics and computer engineering degree think is most likely) you'll have nothing to show. Put enough to survive in a normal account, or better yet an index fund. Anything above that you can use for bitcoin or whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:39:21
High price = higher than today, but like I said bitcoin will eventually find it's true underlying value which is a lot lower than current levels.
And I will say it again, since it apparently needs reiterating in every post I make: Historical results does not predict future returns.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:59:36
You're obviously trying to bait me into saying "yes" and then responding with "tHaTs whAts SoCieTY iS likE" but you're missing the glaring differences between a bitcoin exchange and a bank. I trust the banks with my money, and the state has insurance policy such that i'm secure even if a bank were to fail. I don't worry about inflation, it's kept at a steady 2% and no first would country decides to just print money as hyperinflation is well known. And 10000x more likely to get my money stolen by hacking if I have it in bitcoin compared to on a bank account. This is honestly some stuff. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:16:02

@_date: 2018-11-29 00:05:22
Alright I'm not going to get into this discussion again, but bitcoin in its current form (yes that includes lightning) has zero selling points to the common man. There is a reason it hasn't caught on in any sense of the word outside of speculation over the 10 years it has now existed. Compare that to how quick the world adopts to other technological advancements these days. I don't see this changing ever.
And of course you start off the post with an insult as per standard on The brilliant minds of the future.

They grow quickly in adoption and get a lot of organic use. Real demand for a product.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:30:42
It's not brilliant at all, it still has a ridiculously high market cap for an asset that's not used by anyone and has very few real world applications. It would need to fall another 99.x% before it reaches sound fundamental levels. I firmly believe that the expected value of investing in bitcoin is negative.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:15:31
You could store them in a normal deposit or government bonds if that's the case. Unless you're the kind of nutcase that think a societal breakdown is just around the corner where all banks fail and we get hyperinflation - those kinds of people are not uncommon in this subreddit.

To be fair I "shit on" bitcoin here equally much during the massive upswing in 2017 with the same arguments. The responses were even more snarky back then actually.
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:01:55
Easy, everything eventually reaches it's fundamental underlying value, regardless of how much short term noise there is. And with extremely little real world usage and zero adoption despite 10 years of being on the market, it should never be valued at 70+ billion dollars.

Since last year, but it does not matter, since you're still thinking that there will be another boom/bust cycle purely based on the fact that there's been several before this point. Oh well, believe whatever you want, the future will be the arbitrator.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:38:52
I think it's very likely bitcoin will continue down towards its true value, and the times it shoots back up for some time, it will be smaller than previous pumps. I don't think bitcoin will ever reach back above 20k for example.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:35:34
Why do retards always end their sentences with three punctuation (...) marks? Genuine question.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:30:53
There aren't hundreds of thousands of people depending bitcoin for their everyday lives. Even 1/1000 of that is probably optimistic.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:35:56
No it's really not. History is actually genuinly not an indicator of future results, it's not just a footnote. Otherwise we should all just invest in apple, microsoft and amazon since those have created the most value thus far. Fundamental underlying value is 1000x more important than anything else, regardless of past performance.
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:23:25

Did I say a single incorrect thing? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:12:20
What? If you believe that the expected value of a dollar invested in bitcoin is negative, then it makes no sense to have any amount of dollars invested. The reasoning of the author ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:52:14
You can believe me or not, it's on you and I don't really care. But I've studied exactly how blockchains work down to the exact algorithms that are solved when mining. I know all the selling points, and I know all the counterpoints. I've read enough national economics courses and am working with an investing firm, and it's my opinion that cryptocurrencies are very unlikely to succeed.
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:49:02
I'm not saying it WILL fall 99%, I'm saying it would need to fall another 99.x% to reach sound fundamental levels. Given how many uneducated speculative people are into bitcoin at this point, I'm sure it will find support before that. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:18:43
Well then you made a bad read, I have a degree in economics and engineering. And you're a few fanatics who use bitcoin as a store of value or for some transactions, but it's far from the mainstream adoption that would be needed to take bitcoin higher.
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:44:27
Look it's clear you don't have any economics background due to all the errors you're making so I don't see any real point for me to continue to explain econ 101 concepts. So this will be the last reply.
With adoption I mean either as a currency or a store of value. There is almost nobody who is using it for either purpose, which means the fundamental value of bitcoin is a lot lower than current prices. If millions of people used bitcoin instead of gold to keep their money safe from inflation or if millions of people used bitcoin as an every day means of transactions, then that would support the underlying fundamentals of bitcoin. But as of now, the price is almost entirely built upon speculation (which is the polar opposite of a "store of value") and speculation is by definition unstable. There is no fundamentals to talk of with regards to bitcoin, which means that bitcoin will eventually fall down a lot more. It's really basic valuation 101, and it's no difference between bitcoin, the oil market, commodities, stocks or anything else. Everything is built on fundamentals and will eventually find it's fundamental price.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:12:11
what, no
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:54:32
lol there is no need to sound so smug when you're completely wrong on every point. Reading a couple of zerohedge posts and watching a few youtube vids doesn't make you an economist.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:49:16
Haha sounds like somebody just finished up econ 101!
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:36:01
I'm sure they make sense to an untrained ear. So does zero hedge or fox news. I'm going to sleep for work but if you're genuinely curious i'll explain tomorrow.

@_date: 2018-12-13 21:16:51
Hey am I tagged?
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:22:30
Thanks, I agree and think bitcoin has a lot more to fall before it reaches sound fundamental levels. With that said I'm too scared to short bitcoin now, seems like it could be oversold and due for a bounce (although thats what I have thought ever since it broke through 5.5k on the downside). If we have a bounce up to like 4.5k-ish I would be very tempted to get in the game again.
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:26:45
That's ridiculous. 99% of bitcoins are used for speculation, everyone knows that.
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:12:38
Haha, keep going
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:27:59
I think bitcoin should be worth at least 10 000x from where it is. Where I pulled that number from you might ask? Well, there is 21 million bitcoin, and 21 million divided by 2 100 is 10 000. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:10:41
Generally people who believe hard in bitcoin is neither rich nor educated. It's the same story with dubious penny stocks. And the mentality there is the exactly the same as here. Kinda sad :(

Yeah there is noone talking about the price anymore, thank god for that.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:58:00
You have no idea that it will go higher. I'd even go as far as saying that it's likely that it will never go above 20k again.

@_date: 2018-12-07 03:05:34
lol if it makes you feel better I didn't win money by shorting. I was short 10 bitcoins between 5.5k to 7.5k before I gave up as I didnt expect the magnitude of the bubble. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent etc. It's very hard to short even obvious bubbles.
I did make most of it back shorting from like 18k-11k and a bit more sporadically after that, but ended up net negative in the whole ordeal. So I'm hoping as much as you guys that there wil be another pump in the future so I can make better shorting plays then.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:33:14
I've been shorting bitcoin a decent amount last year and a half and like to keep up on news but especially the general sentiment among retail investors.

I just think it's a bit ironic how you quote Warren Buffet to make a case for buying bitcoin when he explicitly has said he thinks Bitcoin is a bad investment. Some of the posts in this subreddit are also so economically illiterate that I feel  I sometimes have to chime in and help explain basic concepts.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:04:38
I was refering to the berkshare annual shareholder meeting in january 2018. Even the deposit fees on my plastic bottles have had better return than bitcoin since then.
Either way - the last word is not said yet. Come back in 10 years and see who is outperforming who.

As a financially illiterate retail investor of I assume you've never heard of puts?

I mean you're certainly not up since the point where the split happened. The people who held bitcoin since 2011 but then hopped on the BCH chain instead of the BTC chain are still upp massively as well.

The honest answer is that nobody knows. Nobody knows why it has fallen so drastically at this particular time (no obvious news), and nobody knows where it's heading. It can certainly keep going down so I hope you don't have all your pension money in bitcoin :)

Don't you know that everyone will be rich if we just scapped fiat? Everyone will have the same amount of bitcoins, especially white middle class or higher guys in their 20s. It will be a socialist utopia.
