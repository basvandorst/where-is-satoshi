Honestly the feeling is mutual... I suggest you take some time and read up on Austrian economics if you intend to *actually* try to understand people’s position here. 
The idea that inflation has a net gain for the economy is one of the biggest loads of crock and has been repeatedly debunked as cargo cult science to anyone willing to listen. Unfortunately, most are so stubborn in the belief of their world views that they aren’t really willing to listen.
    
If you’re at all interested in finding out why inflation is seen as a negative by many I suggest reading up... the Mises Institute is a great resource to start with  and they’ll have links to plenty of other resources. 
Personally I’d suggest starting with some works from Henry Hazlitt as I’ve found them quite accessible for beginners. *“What You Should Know About Inflation”* seems like a relevant place to start... but even something as simple as starting with the quite short *”Economics in One Lesson”* should be enough to help you understand why all these claims of inflation as a “net gain for the economy” fall into extremely typical logical fallacies.
Best of luck!

Yeah... pay attention to the sentencing for El Chapo happening in the US and then get back to us. 
El Chapo was one of the most violent, ruthless drug kingpins we’ve ever encountered and was responsible for countless deaths and suffering. Ross was a first time offender who, at the end of the day, never *actually* killed anyone.
I agree he shouldn’t have received just a slap on the wrist; he committed some serious crimes. But I bet when all is said and done, El Chapo will get off easier. 
Ross’ biggest crime was pissing off the wrong people and that’s what his double+ life sentence represents. And that’s the point OP is trying to explain... **the sentence is not proportional to the crime.** There are people who have *actually* killed who get off with less.
