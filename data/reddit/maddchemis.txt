The number one design constraint of bitcoin is decentralization. Period. And [we have already centralized]( way beyond anyone's imagination. 90% of all hashing power is hanging out together, sitting at one table in China! Increasing the block size makes this problem significantly worse. Gavin and Andreas are being rash and risking Bitcoin's existence. [Even 1MB blocks have proven dangerous](

Yes I do. I disagree 100%. Network effect will continue to increase if Bitcoin continues to function properly. 
But what if it suddenly doesn't function properly, massive network effect goes to zero tomorrow. Immediately.
So...drumroll please...I'll restate the obvious....The most important property is decentralized consensus. "Decentralized" being the most important property of bitcoin. And that decentralization can be defined to mean a large number of geographically separated miners (humans not hardware). It means lots of humans working on validation, indeed competing to validate. And no software gimmicks are gonna solve the problem. And we know that increasing the block size massively lowers the number of miners. So increasing the block size is hurting decentralization....badly.

actually Shamir is a security risk. With multisigs, the keys never have to be in one spot or even known by one person. With Shamir's secret, all involved have to come together to recreate one key. At that instant security is lost, all 'board' members could send a secret transaction removing all the funds. Clearly Shamir's secret has a sexy name, and its a provocative concept, but I wouldn't use it to protect ten dollars. Its overhyped.

@_date: 2014-02-13 05:30:20
I will quote you, but I'm not happy about it.


Sorry to say but this is just retarded. Bitcoin can't just be cloned and run by a bank. You can't make a copy of bitcoin that's centralized. Bitcoin only works (and protects value and payments) by the FACT that it is decentralized. Miners competing give it value. If you don't see that, you shouldn't be in this game at all. Its embarassing that none of the other commentors or upvoters noticed this.
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:29:14
This type of attack is NOT new. This has been going on for over a year. These targeted phishing attacks (aka spearphishing) directed at bitcoiners has been making a lot of hackers a lot of money, and it is almost exclusively done through Google Docs. Our complaint needs to be much louder, because Google is the problem here. It provides an attack vector that is much less obvious to detect.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:57:32
I agree with you on so much of what you said. Except for your conclusion. And that's the big problem. Sure if you buy the code for a word processor, you have the word processor, but if you have bitcoin's code you don't have bitcoin. Bitcoin, via Metcalfe's law, has value, because it has value. Circle reasoning that only works with networks. Developing it from scratch and using it internally in a bank is like asking your employees to steal from you. The network won't be protected by petahashes, it will be protected by nothing. BTW I'm not gung ho. I see lots of problems with bitcoin. Just because I point out how you missed understanding on a major point doesn't mean I hold a certain position.

Dan Larimer, who is the guy who invented Bitshares, but also came up with the idea of a DAO (Digital Autonomous Organization), has worked on some beautiful POS stuff (paper from 3 weeks ago about Delegated Proof of Stake). He's not the only one. Vitalik's Slasher has some of the same ideas (punitive POS). Again, POS is not there yet, but it has gotten WAY better. NXT's algorithm needs a write up, because those guys aren't fools either. Its no coincidence that POS coins are constantly among the top five in Market Cap.

I understand Shamir's Secret stuff. But you mentioned it should be used with multisigs. That sounds foolish. Sort of like putting a cheap combination lock on top of a good padlock.

Fair. And I agree with your analysis. But I give Normand more credit than you do. His paper is full of realistic thoughts and paints it in a way that a banker can begin to see this.

But, as i originally guessed, you're just muddying the waters with added layers of confusion and complication. Sorry, but that's just the truth.

Thank you for saving me the time to write virtually the same thing. I read the JP Morgan report before I saw this article. I was actually amazed at how positive and insightful the JP Morgan report was. It really does appreciate much of the excitement of bitcoin and the author is a great writer - this excerpt hardly seems negative.
*"the fees imposed by financial intermediaries as
well as the loss of privacy inherent in third-party payments
systems. Hence the purported appeal of a virtual
currency: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a
store of value without the alleged recklessness,
capriciousness, siphoning and snooping inherent in
traditional systems. Even leaving aside this caricature of
bitcoin's underlying philosophy, there is something
compelling about the idea."*

Okay doubting thomas, you could do the math yourself because its so easy, but its covered in the video, everything. The total for a modern 51% attack assuming no inside connections comes out to about 200 million dollars. You buy the KNC miners etc. BUT if you have any contacts at a fabrication plant or if you are sovereign who has control over a fab plant you can do much more painful calculations. 51% can cost under 20 million. Now add to this the fact that Selfish Mining makes a 51% attack possible with 33% of the network (you can look up the Princeton paper yourself), and the price drops more. With Proof of Stake, the math is easy, its half the market cap. So today that is 3 billion for bitcoin. 3 billion is more than 10x 200 million, and over 100x 20 million. Your welcome for the schooling.

ANSWER for KEMICZA: What if the amount is not 300BTCs but instead some very common amount, say 1BTC or even 0.001BTC, and checking the users address there are many of these types of transactions. What Gox would have to do is search their receiving address and find one of Gox's own addresses sending the funds out at the correct time. It is very doable. Gox just didn't do this. Its a big mistake on their part, but its hardly Gox's fault.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:32:59
POS 51% attack at the very cheapest costs 1/2 the market cap, most likely more, because you will drive the price up trying to aquire 50% of the coins. So for bitcoin right now it is 3 billion. For Bitcoin's 51% attack definitely watch James video on cost. He comes up with two numbers both valid and calculated out (200 million with no special contacts, and 20 million with contacts at a silicon fab plant)

POS has evolved quite a bit since all the cliche negatives people keep using. Now that's not saying it is perfect today, but it has improved massively. And the advantages are MASSIVE. POS protects the blockchain 10x better than POW. Simple as that. And the trouble is people keep listening to figureheads about POW, but the situation has gotten dangerous. For example, Andreas has spoken a number of times about a 51% attack ([video here]( But his math is just not adding up. This is scary, because if he is wrong we are all screwed. James has done two videos on 51% attacks ([here]( and [here]( calculating the costs and looking at what an attacker can do. This is up to date and accurate information. Both vids need much more attention. James breaks down why Gavin Andresen's solution won't work &amp; how big a problem this is. Worse, James comes in with numbers much much lower than Andreas &amp; talks about how easy it would be to run a devastating Transaction Denial of Service attack on bitcoin, today. Am I the only one who finds [this]( a little scary?

The real problem is previously alluded to by other folks in other threads. It is fine to have a private meetings for friends and family members. Yet, why give it a big name and exclusive atmosphere. Instead Satoshi's Roundtable had graphics of elitist monarchies and was billed as an exclusive event. DId they all wear white tennis jackets? That is how it feels.

But  remember it is in line with the Media Lab, which does almost everything for publicity and profit motives. It is also MIT's most public face to the world. And perhaps they were worried about how rock-the-boat Bitcoin appeared to outsiders, so they hired a snake-like, establishment tool, to keep things boring and moving forward - enter Forde. MIT lives off of its branding as a leader in technology. But man, there are so many fools running around there these days its sickening. Brian Forde is just the leader of the idiot pack.

that's actually not true at all. and quite scary that you think that. they could come up with a generation system that lowers the randomness 99% that would still do exactly what you said. And lowering the randomness increases the ability to steal. BE CAREFUL my friend. this is an issue.

"and shoot first" is an operative contingency here that only gun fanatics would subscribe to. I have a son, I like my family, clearly you can take risks i can't.

Let's not forget that Ross the philosopher was equivalent to Che Guevara. Che was almost caught a million times.
Here's a quote from Ross aka DPR
"Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.”

some folks, like me, are too sloppy, absent minded and just plain losing shit everywhere, that relying on someone else to help can be a positive thing. Some folks keep gold under there bed. I'm not one of them.

Caught in the sci-fi section of the library, drawing stoners with pencil...which all means, i agree.

oh, i see. and i thought as much.
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:51:14
interesting. I am very curious to hear more.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:50:06
Thanks...and I hear you. Its a tad tragic, because while i own a lot of bitcoins, I'd own more bitcoins if I felt they were even slightly more secure.

while I did laugh, i do hope you realize i was being sarcastic.

This is the second in what looks like it will be a definitive series on the benefits of bitcoin. This one looks at how bitcoin could help the 3.5 billion unbanked on earth, with over 30 million unbanked in the USA.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:11:20
Same thoughts exactly. 
There are lines in the code that scare me.
What's this doing in there "5J8QhiQtAiozKwyk3GCycAscg1tNaYhNdiiLey8vaDK8Bzm4znb"???
And what about all this? You can delete it and the program still works...It looks like dozens of pre-loaded private keys.

i'd love to understand what the OP is saying "TA-wise"???

why on earth would anyone downvote this? please explain. downvoting just seems so wimpy here. No it is WIMPY. If it touches you, upvote and comment with your disapproval of the idea. But there are BIG ideas here, by an important person in the community regardless of deed.

THere's a movement to begin this on January 1st. A little [vacate wall street]( as suggested by [this](
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:59:49
so what you are saying is that you understand all that code, or maybe you're just throwing some jabs about? because if you REALLY understand the code, i have some real coding issues I see with bitaddress.org just for you.
@_date: 2013-10-12 21:48:01
Maybe the old adage is true "all press is good press" works again. So many more people heard about bitcoin in the last month.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:30:06
aaaaaaaaahhhhh, like most things, much clearer the second time around. i'll soften my response.

Yes. This is the idea!!!

Thanks, that hurts. And while I like coinbase, apparently you have some good alternatives I don't know about....we're waiting hater.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:51:35
question for you on that.
say i had a generated private key...i'll grab one from bitaddress
is it still a valid, but different, private key if I manually change some of the characters, like what I did here to the last six characters?

i hear you. but say someone comes into my house just as i've logged on to my account, he points the gun at my head, i don't have time to log out...those coins can now be sent anywhere. i'll never see them again. that's my fear. its worse than having money in a sack, because at least he has to carry all of it out of the house.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:03:29
thanks a million. much needed help.

I'd tip my hat to Andreas Antonopoulos. He's a tour de force.

That's funny, amusing, and quite likely the best thing i've heard all day.
