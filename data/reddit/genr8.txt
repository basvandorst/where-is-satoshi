Same situation as above. I don't have any net profit in 2013 NOR do i even have any other income. Question: withdrawal from my bank happened in 2013, and I will likely re-deposit the identical sum back in 2014= being Different Tax periods, would this be a concern?

$26k initial, 89 bitcoins at the end. except I made a trade 5 seconds before trading halt shutdown and it was $11k.. all i had. Going to get a job :(

And if not, generations from now, it will be too late to change anything. 
STEM = Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Mathematics 
I had never of heard this acronym, and yes I agree with the above. My suggestion is to try to recruit the specific women you know that are interested in the above and that you think would be receptive to Bitcoin. I would hope this is already going on, but trying to convert an entire gender at once is not even an option. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:27:04
To help get back on topic, can you please respond back with the aspects of bitcoin that your converts have gravitated to ? 
Here's some reasons I can come up with (which have nothing to do with what gender you are):
1) Making money by:
 a) risky speculation
 b) long term investment
2) Buying stuff online
3) Freedom
4) Novelty 
5) Cryptography
Figure out which one is the best at convincing them to become part of the bitcoin community (they don't have to use it every-day), and focus on that. Then we need to address the barriers of entry women are likely to get hung up on.

Totally agree with poster above me. I recommend Bitfloor, they credited my account within 2 hours of the deposit. And Bitme credited the account within 4 hours but required a scanned picture of the bank receipt sent to their email. Might wanna try out  but you need to build reputation to buy anywhere more than a few coins. Everyone has their own rates/limits.

I think what the OP was getting at is, instead of re-inventing the wheel by selling an ASIC system enclosure (chassis) complete with ATX power supply, why not build a card that can draw 150 watts from the PCIe slot. This way the costs are reduced to the point of the wafer itself + a few ICs for VRMs and such and the PCB to put it on. For example the Avalon comes in a shiny metal case with a bunch of fans, and a hefty power supply, with 4 expansion slots (3 of which are filled with compute units), so an option should be available for people not willing to shell out $1500, and just make a PCI-e version of 1 of the ASIC compute units a single slot and get 22GH/s for $500. Maybe less. This way more people can get into the game, and it would be easy to produce and ship. 
But then again maybe Avalon is approaching this the right way, by designing a self sufficient product that is fully compatible, stable and predictable in every way. The only downside is the cost :D Which the BFL Jalapeño remedies if it would ever get shipped. (Btw i ordered one Feb 16th, they said it would ship late may - early june)

he meant the RAM on your video card, not your system ram. although i doubt either will help all that much on power usage. what lowering the ram clocks does help with is heat output on the card, leading to higher GPU core overclocks. 
Also I read somewhere that its smart to keep Ram speed at 1/3rd the core clock to help keep synchronized(?)
You can always switch to a command line miner, and you can get a few more Mhashes (maybe up to 235 with the 6770) if you stop using GUIminer as its not the best (entry level).

I second this motion. I switched from BTCGuild to Mt. Red a couple weeks ago.

Well theres 17 minutes to go. Who is getting one ?
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:26:25
Haha... I did this also on my own and reached the same figures. I can confirm this is true.

I actually need to figure out how I'm going to convert 1500 USD into bitcoins by 9AM on a federal/bank holiday. Anybody have any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-02-25 03:05:04
I hope you people didn't get any ideas from that above post.
@_date: 2013-02-18 14:39:59
I saw 330 in stock at 9:03 AM, then 20 minutes later theyre all gone. Solves my problem, since I couldnt muster up 60 bitcoins on a federal bank holiday in under 20 minutes.

Slush's, BTC, or Mt.red
Since you're on reddit. try to use mt.red -  Their PPS rate is quite high: 0.0000068474172445 compared to the next highest - ~~BTCGuild's PPS rate of 0.0000065050475060.~~ 50BTC.com's PPS Rate of 0.00000664 .  The downside of mt.red is that since its a low hashrate pool, each round takes on the order of a few hours to complete (and therefore pay out your earnings) BTCGuild has a pool hashrate of 9.6TH/s and pays out earnings every instantly for each share submitted.  The  4.5 Terahash megaminer  Asic user uses BTCGuild, and I used to use it before mt.red.  You can also do PPLNS earnings on BTCGuild and their PPLNS rate pays somewhat higher right this moment: @ 0.0000067776634170  But it can drop below 600_ and I've seen it as high as 800_ (significant digits listed only).  Basically PPLNS has higher variance and pays out earnings each round  (every 23-25 minutes). Slush's pool calculates things a different way, and rewards you based on age of your shares. Slush's design was hard for me understand at first, so let me simplify: Its a proportional AND time based(score) system. You get paid for exactly the fractional amount of shares compared to what the entire pool submits. Except that everyones shares at the beginning of the round count for next to nothing if the round goes longer than X time, lets say X is 300 seconds? ("it is a sum of how many getWorks were solved in this round (submitted shares), each multiplied by current scoring factor = exp(t/300) . Where t is time in seconds. ) Every share is multiplied by an _exponential_ function, so for example your first share might be worth 0.00065432100 at 20 seconds into the start of the round, but that same share might be worth 0.00000000000000001 at the end of the round, and the share most recently submitted 4 hours into the round is now worth 0.00076543321.  and quickly decays in value as time progresses.  Slush implemented this to prevent pool hopping. This means that if you have a low hashrate (like a  few hundred MH/s or less) as the round goes longer, you have vastly higher variance because the round may end before JUST before you submit the share that you were crunching for the past few minutes, (the only one that would have been worth a significant 0.000250ish payout) because within the minute or few minutes your previously last submitted share decayed to next to nothing. So faster hashrate's do better on Slush. Slush's rounds sometimes drag on to 4-5 hours and if you refresh a lot you can see your estimated reward varying a lot depending on how long ago the last share submitted was.

I _heard_ they track you by what phone number you put down on the moneygram form, so if you have 4 phone numbers, you'd be fine. might wanna change name to a family member on the other forms or something just to be sure.

If I got an ASIC tomorrow, I would do 2 things, test it on slush's first for 24 hours, and then test it on 50BTC.com PPS and then BTCGuildsPPLNS. I would think 24 hours is the right amount of time to test each pool. And you would really never know which is best until you do it, but just look at:  . This explains a lot without any explanation.

Bitstamp seems great for EU customers. US Customers have better options available. Please use Bitfloor, it's my favorite and I want greater market depth on it. Also Bitme needs help, they are great but quite small yet.

Any info on mtgox wire transfer fees appreciated.
What is the total amount of fees on this ACH wire transfer through mtgox. They said something about their bank charging a 1000 yen receiving bank fee, and plus my own bank (bank of america) likely charges a fee for sending the outgoing transfer, in addition to any intermediaries between here and japan... They said with deposits under $50 you are likely to receive hardly anything... So is the fee actually $50?!!?!

Bitfloor has maker taker. People need to switch.
