Hostility isn't going to change anyone's minds either dude, you may want to re-think your approach to negative comments :)

Is that 33million based on something, or just a number out of the air?

Ah, didn't know about these - thanks!
EDIT: I assume these only work with funds you already have deposited within coinbase/bitpay, yea? Similar to fiat in a bank.

Well, there is, and that is a recurring payment that only needs to be set up once. 
The fact this can't be done with bitcoin will always be a limiting factor for subscription-based services.

Yeah, absolutely, but let's be honest - no one is currently going to be changing a penny jar in to bitcoin.
This will be targeted at transactions between 10-100 rather than 1-10.

Coins take up more space in the machine, so it needs to be emptied more frequently.
Better to use that same space for notes which are of a higher value and much more compact.

No, it's because of the small holding of bitcoin within the fund of approx ~~0.0298%~~ 2.98%
The 1.06% yield in the total value of the fund was directly caused by the 35.49% increase in bitcoin price regardless of the performance of the other investments; it's the effects of risk mitigation and makes the inverse true as well, if the BTC price fell by 35.49%, it would only affect the value of the fund by 1.06%.     
Edit: what's an order of magnitude or two between friends? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:02:52
Dammit, yes you're right, did the working too quickly and forgot what magnitude I was at.

I mean, it's not impossible to do.
Others are commenting about how this is silly because you can't eliminate maths, and while this is true, you can't,  you can effectively kill bitcoin by making it sufficiently difficult that most people just don't bother. 
The value of bitcoin has increased over the years due to the ever increasing ease of use, allowing more people (especially those with lower tech-literacy) to mine it, spend it, trade it, and accept it. 
"All" it would take would be a modification to the KYC regs to say that bitcoin payment doesn't adequately identify the customer *in any situation* (be that true or not) and mass adoption will never become a reality. If mass adoption is no longer possible, then investment reduces as the likelihood of a positive return plummets. 
Yea, sure, some places will still accept it, silkroad et al will still exist, but there will be this hard upper limit that, as far as this guy is concerned, will have effectively killed it.

Cool, I hadn't heard about that :)

That's still having to manually make the payment yourself though - the current Uber system works really well because it is literally effortless after the initial setup of adding your card.
Trust has nothing to do with the point I'm making - it's all about ease of use, I still pay for both my power and internet via direct debit rather than having to manually send the money to the company via cheque or similar. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:09:30
Isn't the issue with bitcoin and uber - unless I've missed something - that because of the way Bitcoin functions they can't debit your wallet automatically?
The great thing about Uber is that, no matter how drunk I am, all I have to do is fall out of the car and in to my house - not having to worry about how I'm going to pay - because as soon as the ride is finished I get billed immediately to my credit card.
Un(til/less) Bitcoin has something akin to direct debits, this sort of experience isn't possible and we just go back to the 'good old days' of having to physically make a payment by scanning a QR code, or whatever.

Denying humanity's involvement in climate change - i.e anthropogenic climate change - is climate change denial. 
There are literally hundreds of papers which tackle cyclical warming and cooling cycles (like ice ages) and the impact of an increase in carbon and methane in the atmosphere from human-centric sources (cars, fuel, agriculture including cattle).

See, now this is interesting. Hitler's place as a figurehead on the authoritarian right as the head of the fascist Nazi Party isn't a contentious point, so your desire to argue raises some questions as to *why* you feel challenging this fact is important.
The aspects you describe are those of authoritarian leaders. This is a separate measure and doesn't impact whether someone is "left" or "right".
Your definition of the right being one of small government conflates right wing ideologies with libertarianism. Considering this is the opposite of authoritarianism, with each being one end of the scale, libertarianism again isn't an impact on left or right. For evidence of this see the conflicts between free-market libs and anarco-communistists, and how a focus on individualism can be done in respect, or in spite, of the best outcome for a group.
This conflation leads me to believe that you're American. So to go back to my first point, why does an American - on a bitcoin sub of all places - feel the need to challenge a statement as uncontentious as Hitler being right wing, and by implication, the Nazis being fascist?

Hitler wasn't a socialist. He fundamentally changed the party platform in the early 30s after strongarming his way to leadership, in a move which would mirror his rise to chancellor.
It's actually a super interesting period of political history and how entities can be completely changed if the right things are present - mainly charisma, and fear. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:23:43
Your responses are betraying your ignorance. 
I'd highly recommend you go and read more about Hitler's rise to power because, truly, it is fascinating and you'll learn a lot.
Yes he joined the National Socialist Workers Party and yes he became the leader, but the party and its politics were fundamentally changed as he rose to and then consolidated his power.
To repeat myself for the final time, it's very odd that you're trying to argue this point, it's about as uncontroversial a point about Hitler and the Nazis as can be made. It suggests an ulteria motive, which is only made more suspicious by your continued attempts to conflate left/right and auth/lib spectrums.
If you want to read about truly left wing authoritarians, then I'd suggest having a look at the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot for what Authoritarian Marxism looks like.
