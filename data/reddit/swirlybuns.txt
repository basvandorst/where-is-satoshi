They have wallet alerts, you can try it.  I dont think exchange wallets are "real" so I doubt you can track them like a wallet you control the private key for.

Banning BTC is already an issue of free speech.  Another "legitimate" country officially supporting it would probably help the cause further.

Something that guarantees returns is called a ponzi scheme

People sell their World of Warcraft account, and stuff like that.  Selling a wallet sounds similar.  Seems kinda silly though.

Bitcoin is the first widely used/successful implementation of a blockchain.  Most new coins are either tokens (they leverage an existing blockchain such as Ethereum) or they are in fact their own blockchain.

square credit card readers are absolutely everywhere.  this could be the first step towards something huge..

it's where the pending transactions live.  if the mempool size gets too big, transaction fees go way up and it might take a long time for your transaction to get confirmed

Keep calm and [set a price alert](
