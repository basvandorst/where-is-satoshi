This is BS. I was about to send btc, and as soon as i pressed submit, the thing booted me out.
Maybe i caused some kind of a Bitcoin wormhole to open?
Time to leave Coinbase. It's less dependable and more big-brotherly than any bank i've used.

I wonder if the people claiming that the Soviets were claiming to be true communists realize that the name of that country - USSR - stood for Union of Soviet SOCIALIST Republics.
Anyone who lived there and had to take political science in school was taught that the current system they had was Socialism, with the goal of building Communism eventually.
In America, a very small percentage  of the population even gets a formal lesson in political science. So, we are indoctrinated informally by mass media and word of mouth that we live in free-market Capitalism. And most of the US leadership and academia agree with that.
In realisty, the US system is really a form of Fascism, if you look that up, and has been since at least the FDR days. So btw, is the post-Soviet Russia, and most other countries.
That's where cryptocurrencies can be most helpful; neither Socialism, nor Fascism is possible without complete control over the money supply.

No, unless you just like gambling. Just use it as a currency, until it becomes more stable.
No one can really answer your question for sure; "experts" can't do that even with precious metals that have been in use as money for most of human history.

Parent-child interactions are entirely capitalist from birth. People have children for selfish and self-serving reasons: the ultimate hope is that if they raise the child well and pass on all their resources to them that the child will take care of them when the parent becomes old and unable to fend for himherself.
The child ideally repays the good that was done himher, in return for inheritance. It's all wrapped in a lot of fancy BS, but in reality entirely capitalist.

That often happens on FTF trades, such as LocalBitcoins, which are perfectly legit. So, something shady happening has nothing to do with premiums.
 Even if you set the deal at spot rate on Brawker, the scammers could cheat you and the system just as easily; they would just get away with more bitcoins.
So, the premium level has nothing to do with Brawker users being scammed either.

It not so much dumb, as a really intellectually lazy question, which has been asked many times already here and in the forums.
All you had to do to answer it is substitute anything you want into it instead of Bitcoin: 
What if the government wanted to end air pollutions and bought up all the oil, and pumped it back into the ground?
What if the government wanted to end gold trade, and bought all of it, and dumped it in the deepest part of the ocean?

It's a great way for Stockman to show his constituency that he is on their side. However, this wil not even get out of the committees.
Unfortunately, it won't even get as far as Ron Paul's bills to restore fiscal and monetary sanity, the Simpson-Bowles proposals and the like.
If high-seniority insiders couldn't even do that, this bill is almost a waste of time.
Most of the criminals in Congress will just laugh it off, and the others will just be reminded to work to ban it, in order to protect the ponzi fiat scam, which is their bread and butter.

No, a good start would be for the Fed/Gov to allow an external audit of US gold reserves - Ft. Knox, etc.  
It should just be illegal to sell paper metals, which don't represent actual metal. There is more paper gold than there is actual gold.

I agree with you. Until MS starts to offer its employees and contractors payment in bitcoin, the only company accepting bitcoin in this case is again BitPay.
As with other companies, MS is still just looking to get more USD. So, this is not significant, as the price action continues to show, as this kind of fake adoption of Bitcoin spreads.

Sorry to hear that; the saddest part of the story is you didn't even have to wait for the blockchain to download.
All you needed was one receiving address from that wallet, and have the btc sent to that. At least you have work to exchange for more btc, which half of Americans, for example, don't have these days.
Well, I've definitely made my share of mistakes with Bitcoin back then also - most crypto people have. One of the brightest crypto minds, Stephan Thomas, famously lost his private key to a 10,000 btc wallet!
My prediction though is that if bitcoin has seen its top agains fiat, then you didn't miss anything when you didn't exchange for it at $10. If bitcoin has not seen its fiat top, then you are still as early and adopter as we were back then, and 0.25b will become very useful...

Does anyone know how one gets around the legal tender laws with this?
I thought that if a company is doing business in the US, it has to accept USD in some form as payment. :^?

Exactly! This is a very significant story: it shatters that whole laissez-faire image Estonia is trying to create!
Shows plainly that every government is just an armed bunch, looking to get their cut by their patented Proof of Violence algorithm. The only difference from border to border is a matter of degree.
If the US marshals hadn't "confiscated" a dozen fortunes worth of bitcoin, I bet the US government would be far more motivated to ban it also. They can't auction to gain fiat something that they ban.
I wonder if there will turn out to be a correlation between the amount of bitcoin a government has and whether or not it's trying to ban cryptocurrencies?

All animals are highly competitive. It is true that H. sapiens is a top-level predator, and acts accordingly...
Militaries will always be, but things like Bitcoin will act to limit them financially.
First central banks arose to facilitate MI-complex financing:
This coercive, indirect fleecing of the taxpayer has progressed to the point that even the US military budget is considered by the US gov to be "unauditable":
Even IF it's made "auditable", the clandestine ops budget will remain a blank check for reasons of so-called "National Security".
If cryptocurrencies become dominant, the MI-complex will have to scale down, or go back to direct coercion for funding, the way it was before central banks enabled it with unlimited funding.
The scale of wars in the 19th and 20th centuries would have been impossible without fiat currency. Large military ventures before that, would have been impossible if gold and silver could be hidden from government looters the way cryptocurrencies can be.

Who would buy something anywhere but Walmart today? Who would pay a 100s% premium for a Starbucks cup of coffee, when you could just make one at home for few cents?
I think you are not naive, but have just been brainwashed really well into thinking that nothing besides price should matter to anyone.

I think this is going to be 1929 reloaded. My question is whether it's going to crash within a similar time-frame:
"...stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, **leaving stocks in great excess of their real value.** Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were **low wages, the proliferation of debt,** a struggling agricultural sector and an **excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.**
Stock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. **Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock,** producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors..."

I bet they agree! Zero-fee trading exchanges can fake volumes and manipulate rates the way even MtGox didn't.
If there is really so much Chinese bitcoin demand, it's time to put at least some fake fees with a Willy-bot into their operations...
Given the long-standing tradition of inflated Chinese economic, fiscal and monetary stats, even compared to that of the US counterparts, it's stupid to believe that these guys' explanations are even close to the truth...
It's disappointing to read bitcoinmagazine even cite these sources as credible. It's definitely giving coindesk a run for its bitcoin in terms of yellow journalism.

Charlotte, NC is the second-largest banking center in the US, after NYC!
To expect that the bankers would just leave crypto alone in their southern capital, after what they did to it in their northern capital, is unrealistic.
(NC is also:
In the top 10 states with the highest number of state and local employees per capita.
USDOD is one of the top funding sources of its economy.
In the top 5 in terms of the number of military people.
Has 9% of US towns with lowest incomes.
36th ranked among US states in terms of people who have a high-school education.
The point is that when so much of the population is making its living from the looting power of the government, crony-capitalism, fascism, militarism, or just getting by due to low income and/or education, it's natural that their elected officials would be among the first to move to "protect" them from the "dangers" of unregulated money transmission...)

"An alternative system" existed in the US only a generation or so ago:
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:28:15
The governments is the only group of people in the world that make their living exclusively by taking away resources of other groups by force or under the threat of force. (Even "criminals" - as a social group - don't make all their money exclusively by force.) The government fiat banking systems defraud people; their "tax" systems extort people.
Given that, the main reason they want your help catching people who harm other people, is because they are afraid that Bitcoin will affect their ability to continue their coercive way of life with the same largess.  The rest of their reasons are just standard propaganda for the masses. 
Bitcoin was made to counterbalance their physically and financially harmful system. Unless you are forced to do it, why would you volunteer to help such a class of people with anything?
It's amazing how smart you and some other crypto devs are, yet you continue to ignore and minimize this basic, pragmatic point.
