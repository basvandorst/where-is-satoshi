Just curious - as I presume you are an advocate of Bitcoin. Don't you think it would be great to have a Satoshi but in regards to infrastructure? Perhaps like the hyperloop that Elon Musk is proposing.

Interesting perspective - can I look at your evidence?

Can you let know your country or city? If not then maybe the companies? You can PM me if you want just very curious :) and want to learn more. I don't doubt you just think your scenario is preferable.

I guess so but how come alcohol and tobacco are legal? 8,000 people died in the UK in 2010 from alcohol related diseases and around 75,000 in 2011 from tobacco related diseases (according to ash.org.uk). Why are they not banning alcohol and tobacco - thats what I want to know?

And at the risk of being ignorant I had two other questions. Are you using the CEOs wage in of itself as an argument against capitalism? 
How to do anti-capitalists propose value exchange without capital?
