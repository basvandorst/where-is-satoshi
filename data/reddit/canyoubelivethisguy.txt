This is such a nasty sentiment. People who are ill informed dont deserve to be robbed.  This could easily happen at even a more legit exchange like coinbase. Probably will happen eventually.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:04:50
But what is the point of bitcoin if you're just going to secure it in a bullet proof wallet and sit on it. If you cant trade and exchange it safely anywhere its fairly pointless.  Hopefully a company will open an exchange where they are actually insured properly so if all the money disappears they and their customers arent screwed.  Also a better security team would help. 
Say what you will about fiat....  All the money in my bank account has never disappeared with no recourse.
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:16:11
I don't get how this works, can someone do an ELI5?  So people upload stuff, like pirated software or whatever and then downloaders pay bitcoin to the uploader?  Or you pay for the download and the website takes the money for bandwidth?
I guess I don't understand how thins will ever become a thing, isn't the whole point of piracy that people don't want to pay for content?  why would anyone pay for stolen content even if its just a few pennies when there are thousands of other methods to get the same content for free.
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:00:35
seriously, every single time theres economic instability somewhere everyone here thinks that all of a sudden an entire nation is going to see the light and start using bitcoin somehow.  I can see the future, and this will make bitcoin go up or down some small amount randomly, just like every other day.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:19:46
ha, true.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:46:12
ah so people who upload a file lots of people want will get a small reward.  I'm not sure how that will work out for them since I would assume the vast majority of files will be pirated content.  Seems like they are just asking for trouble, I don't think the major studios and content owners will be thrilled to learn pirates are making a hefty profit by stealing and distributing their stuff.
How does he intend to not get shut down and possibly jailed for creating a huge for profit piracy ring?
I guess on the positive side if this takes off and goes mainstream it will quickly become one of bitcoins biggest userbases.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:18:54
Is it just me or does there always seem to be a "security breech" or "software problem" or "exploit" on some exchange every time theres price fluctuations to be exploited?
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:13:31
Agreed, but bitcoin is never going to get mass adoption if everyone needs to be an expert on securing their holdings.  Places like online exchanges are in theory supposed to be a place where "experts" can handle the security and make a simple to use front end for the user in exchange for a fee.  But if they get robbed and everyone loses their money over and over again no one will ever trust it enough to use it.
Plus if a big exchange with a team of programmers and security personal can't keep their money safe what chance does your aunt who can barely work her iphone stand?
@_date: 2016-08-22 20:45:30
Yeah, unfortunetely it seems exchanges are either cheap or safe and never both. Coinbase charges a crazy high fee but they are basically a liscensed US bank so the risk os small. Bitfinex was the go to place for this because of lower fees and we saw how that turned out. 
Theres a lot of services out there that do this for a tiny fee. But the real fee is the knowledge that all your money can disappear with no explaination instantly forever. Thats a high fee in my book.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:17:34
That's my whole point.  You have your bitcoin securely on your personal wallets, but you become just as vulnerable as the people you are criticizing when you put that money into an exchange to trade or convert to another currency.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:15:03
yeah its entirely out of state control. The gold coins dont have value because a mint pressed it into a shape and sold it. Its because the gold itself has value. 
Im nit picking but i think that point on the list is false is all. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 21:34:17
this is why I almost never buy things with bitcoin. With a credit card you would have been refunded instantly or just been able to buy what you wanted.  Now they have your money and you have to spend hours on the phone to get it back. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:12:02
Yeah absolutely theres out of print books and currently undistributed films etc that people download and thats sort of fine.  People share open source code and OS's and shareware etc.  But lets face it, like 96% of it is people downloading readily available for sale games, moves and TV shows that just don't want to pay for it for various reasons.
I'm not making a judgement or trying to be a jerk but thats just the reality.  When people are talking about file sharing and torrents and newsgroups its mostly piracy.
I get that its a heated issue and many people feel entitled to everything ever made whether its for sale or not.  To me personally though I think it has really stifled mid budget movies.  There will always be no and low budget indies out there and even more so now due to the cheap gear and distribution methods and there will probably always be the huge megabudget starwars and marvel and big action movies.  But I think what we are all collectively missing out on is the middle ground movies.  Take Sony and Disney for example, they used to make over 100 titles a year on their various labels of weird and cool shit that you can't do on a no budget and is too niche for a huge budget.  So we're missing out on some great films because the studios wont take the hit.  Unless its a movie for everybody on the planet they aren't interested because piracy will eat up too much of the profit to make it worthwhile.  Instead of investing in 40 1-10 million dollar movies they can just make yet another generic super hero film and triple their money instead of breaking even or worse on a movie that won't get a big box office but will become a cult classic.

How is gold sovereign and govt issued?  Its pretty much the analog bitcoin no?
Well except its other shortcomings
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:00:50
this is probably the best way to handle this, but i dont know how any expects the public to start trusting in bitcoin when so many of the companies that deal with it are scams, corrupt or just inept and lose all their money to theft.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:01:55
yeah true, but still.  When a bank gets robbed or hacked their whole customer base isn't on the hook for the loss.  And even if the government was coming after your assets and you had a load of bitcoin it wouldn't take them long to figure that out and get it as well.
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:12:39
ha, isn't that the basis of like ALL piracy.  Big uploaders get ad revenue and the torrent hosting sites get tons of ad revenue as well.  It's big business stealing other peoples shit.
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:40:55
ugh, come on everyone with these 3 same points.  It's not a good store of value because it just isn't, unlike almost every other investment it could literally be worth $1 in a week under the right circumstances and losing 20% value would be business as usual.  During times of economic uncertainty like say.... right now it sometimes goes up a little, but hten it almost always goes down again soon. If you bought almost any stock the day after Brexit and waited 2 days you would have made a good profit.  If you thought "BTC to the moon cuz governments and currency devaluation" then you would have lost money by today.  the last point profit... well, some people made a lot of money on bitcoin but most people lost money... unless you are a miner, a bitcoin business  or unreasonably lucky you would be better served investing elsewhere.
Bitcoin investing in a gamble, plain and simple and pretending ottherwise is dishonest or foolish.  Its a decent gamble because if it takes off the sky is the limit on the gains, but it probably won't and you might just lose all or most of your cash...
I love the bitcoin, but a sound investment it is not.
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:09:45
drug dealers like making money, thats why they stay away from bitcoin;)
Seems like the exchange from fiat to btc and back again would pit you at as much or more risk of gettig caught than storing barrels of cash no?
@_date: 2016-06-30 10:48:17
but... it could all be worth a dollar in a week.. Its not very likely but it is very likely that it will be worth less in the short term than it is now and also likely that it will be worth less in the long term...  So not a very good store of value.  Burying dollar bills in your yard is a safer store of value.
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:43:06
exactly, if you want to get girls you dont go out selling yourself hard, telling girls how great you are and how they should totally date you.  You make yourself so awesome they want you!
Lets all make bitcoin better with better and more intuitive software, faster transaction verifications, bigger block sizes so if bitcoin actually does start being used on a wider scale it will actually be able to handle it.
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:46:17
It means that the real stock exchange where real stocks are traded is not where BTC will be listed for now, and maybe it will be on BATS where most people wont be able to or see or know or care to trade it.
But fear not, BTC will always be available to buy and trade on the NBAC market (Neck beards and criminals)...
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:30:56
I have a nice wallet on my smart phone, I have like $100 worth of bitcoin or so on there in case I want to spend it.  I have used it for purchases only on Louis CK's website.  I've never bought anything anywhere else that accepts it...  Theres just not many places that take it and the ones that do aren't places I normally buy things, plus I have a pretty awesome credit card that gives me good rewards so I like to use that whenever I can.
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:32:02
I don't get the obsession with trying to get big retailers to use a payment system that no one even seems to want to use online.  The retailers who publish the amount of customers that pay with bitcoin always have very low figures.  I think bitcoin is great, but until it can handle the volume of transactions worldwide retail would require and can get verifications done in less than 20 seconds its just not going to work.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:08:44
Bitcoiners are always ragging on FIAT because of fees, I don't pay any fees moving money from one bank account to another or to pay back a friend or to use a credit card, credit card actually pays me cashback...
But anyways the fees in bitcoin are confusing and poorly implemented into software, even though the fees are low they suck and are a little high in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:37:07
I was just kidding....  But whenever I try to talk to my GF about bitcoin she just sits there looking at me with a blank stare.  Shes a doll though so I wouldn't expect her to understand such things.
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:03:27
Probably not all that much. The huge bast majority of people affected by that have never heard of bitcoin. but if people fall on economic hard times they will probably be less apt to mess around with their money on something like bitcoin. 
As a passive observer of the market it seems like miners, investors and whales make the market move much much more than any trditional markers of economic change. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:54:53
Unfortunetely anything that threatens the status quo like bitcoin could will probably made illegal or regulated into insignificance. Theres too much power and money staked in the system as it is. I know i know, its decentralized and the government cant stop you from using it, but if it were made illegal most people would avoid it simply for that reason. 
Ot would be easy to manufacture a scenario where mass opinion would favor making it illegal, a massive public child porn sting or ties to terrorism for example. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:25:28
Yes, don't talk to girls about bitcoin.  They don't care.  Unless you have a ton of it, then they will probably care.
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:39:33
Exactly, a huge investment in the technology, infrastructure, kiosks, employee training etc all to accommodate the 1 or 2 neck beards a day per store that would actually want to use it?  The world is not ready for bitcoin and bitcoin is not ready for the world, patience guys patience.
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:57:08
Because if you arent hodling, you are selling which drives down prices. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:06:31
Probably not but definetely yes. Also maybe no but yes might be good but also bad. 
Its always a good and bad time to buy bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-09-14 04:06:49
Yeah, i use it once in a while when i dont have my wallet on me and i remember it exists. it works pretty dang good. If someone made an app that made bitcoin as easy as applepay that would be pretty cool. Although i guess you could get one of them new fangled bitcoin visa cards and lonk that to your applepay account.

Buy porn?  If they have access to the internet they don't need money to see 5 billion porn videos that are out there for free.
And for drugs?  I would wager a guess that more drugs are purchased with cash every hour than have been purchased with bitcoin ever.
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:07:15
True for coinbase. "Coinbase is insured against theft and electronic compromise in an amount that exceeds the average value of bitcoin and ether it holds online at any given time. Specifically, Coinbase's insurance policy would respond to losses resulting from a breach of our physical security, cyber security, or as a result of employee theft.
 
Coinbase has held this insurance since November 2013 with highly rated carriers (S&amp;P rating of A+ or A.M. Best Rating of A XV or higher)."
From what I understand the insurance only exceeds the amount in their exposed hot wallets, so yeah if somehow a person were to steal their cold wallets they would be sol. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 03:25:01
I think I know what the problems is. We need to remive the headphone jack from bitcoin. Thats the killer new feature that will send it to the moon!!!!
@_date: 2016-10-21 13:53:14
That's nice that your gamble paid off, but seriously this is insanity to have half of your money in any single thing, let alone something as potentially volatile as bitcoin.  This is like putting half your money in a single stock.  I think its fine to do non traditional and even high risk investments with small amounts when you are far from retirement, but this is kind of crazy with half of your money.
I would start selling some off and diversify your investments ASAP.
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:52:54
yeah. I like my netflix. So?  Wanna fight about it ;)
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:41:51
Yeah.. I don't own a single connected gimmick machine yet.  This is exactly why.  It will be a cold day in hell when I get a nest or some such BS, it will probably literally be a cold day because those things are unreliable junk and I wont be able to turn on the heater.
@_date: 2016-10-23 04:52:18
While an interesting idea, youre also taking something thats already illegal (piracy) and making it a huge criminal conspiracy of paying for illegal content and getting paid to provide illegal content.  People have gotten some fines or various slaps on the wrist for piracy in the past, but receiving money for it makes it a pretty severe criminal act. 
people who are into bittorrent and illegal downloads do it mainly to avoid paying for content. So trying to sell something exclusively to a group of people who are united by their love of not paying for shit seems like an odd choice. 
Its hard to argue that Netflix is in need of replacing or anywhere near obsolete. The price is very reasonable for what you get and they have exclusive content that is really good. Without people paying for netflix there will be no nezflix content to steal...  so if everyones just paying eachother for illegal copies of content, where is the content going to come from?
@_date: 2016-10-01 11:00:47
Thanks sucks if you truly werent doig anything wrong. But yeah, coinbase has to follow US banking laws so if you are doing something obviously illegal or suspicious they are probably going to lock your account and investigate.  I would call them and ask why and try to figure it out. If you were doing something illegal I would get an attorney and not call coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 04:57:48
Yeah, streaming thousdands of movies and tv shows in HD for 8 bucks a month....  so lame.

Seriously, when I see these types of products I have no idea who they are for. Even if I was a billionaire my fridge would not have a touch screen.  It just seems like for any minor level of convenience they might potentially add, they also add layers of complexity and failure points to otherwose simple and reliable devices.  
The biggest example of this is those amazon fobs that you click to order more of one spedicific item like laundry detergent....  seriously how can you simultaneously be so bisy you need a button to click and summon more tide, but also have so much time on your hands that you can buy and program and connect to your wifi and put new batteries in a single ise device for buying detergent.

I doubt she even knows or cares what bitcoin is. Like most people.  
@_date: 2016-10-14 03:32:41
Yeah dude. Everytime i fix my parents jacked up computer and we have to enter any password they dont know it. They cant even keep track of the password for their email address. Evrytime they get a new iphone we have to reset the password on like half of their services.  i cant imagine the holy hell if they used bitcoin. Theyd send like 10 grand to some random wallet, lose their keys. Email their private key to themselves. It would be a disaster. Most people are way too dumb to use bitcoin as it currently stands. The technicals need to be invisible and ad simple as swiping a credit card before most people will ever consider using it. Not to mention there is no practical need for most people to use bitcoin. If there was the. People would be using it. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:55:35
That's because US dollars aren't scary internet money that no one understands.  Just wait, the fear mongering will commence eventually.
@_date: 2016-07-28 05:24:23
Thats cool. Takes a few days on coinbase in the us
@_date: 2016-07-02 01:10:19
Absolutely.  What I'm saying is that if/when bitcoin becomes something used in a more mainstream way then there will be a backlash from the banks.  If they aren't getting their share of every transaction like they do with credit cards then they will push regulators to ban or restrict its use.
Look at home the cable companies tried to push against net neutrality and start throttling when netflix and hulu started becoming competition.  Similar to that the big money will always push against new disruptive technology.  But unlike netflix, bitcoin is very easy to frame in a way that makes it look shady and scary.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:28:32
That sucks. Seems like sending the transaction id should be proof enough.  This is a huge reason i dont buy things with btc. No recourse whatsoever. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 01:19:47
Now have fun waiting that same 5 days to covert it back to a spendable fiat...
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:31:21
my guess would be a slight jump to over 700 in the next couple weeks as soon as tomorrow.  Then a drop down to like 500ish over a couple months.  Based on nothing but what I think is likely.
But anything can happen and theres not a lot of rhyme or reason to the price for the most part so it makes it impossible to predict really.
I think a lot of people are expecting the moon and it won't happen so there will be some selloff on a small jump.
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:50:11
Yeah pretty much. Its probably going to be very important that the legitamate and positive uses for bitcoin become commonplace before regulators take a crack at it. All it will take is one instance of terror funding using bitcoin to get the whole country chanting to ban it. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:40:08
In less that 24 hours we will see the price skyrocket or decline sharply. Im excoted to see which. I dont really care eitherway. But it will be interesting to see.
