I evidently have 2btc from a cryptovirus coverage account that is not being used. 
Sounds like it's time for a withdrawl.

I think the notion of what can occur here is commonly perceived poorly.
One of the major flaws of most currency systems is lack of transparency. So let's imagine for a second, you are the PRC or the USG, and you decide bitcoin has some "utility", in this regard China has a [small concern]( around real-time SSL decryption, whereas the United States is somewhat more - [invested in the idea](  now there is already, the pedestrian (read civilian - and possibly non-state actor activity that have some occasional news around [spoofing SSL's](
So the question eventually will boil down to is it safe, or more properly backed up by anything. Even a fiat currency represents the GDP potential of a nation. Dollars deflate due to the manipulations of the primary administrator - the Federal Reserve, and due to market fluctuations. 
Why does Bitcoin move - just the market you say - ok - is there any guarantee against a dumping of currency, or something similar - no of course not.
The US Currency, or the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi, or even Euros mark the pinnacle of fiat currencies, based on fractional reserve, and ultimately the manipulation of the marketplace at this time is trivial , but if you think it's not going to occur - think again, every single nation state over a certain GDP, has an interest in ensuring they can command their currency, and if that means buying up a strategic reserve of Bitcoins to dump as needed, so be it.
Eventually I suspect a world currency or something close to universal currency is likely to arise, probably around the three major trading blocs in the world, China/India, the US/Americas and the EU/Russia, to whatever extent this is possible, alternative currencies are likely, but until there is sufficient reserve and capacity to be transparent in an opaque medium, I suspect bitcoin is a wonderful and necessary experiment, but I really am hoping someone can help me convert my [lindybucks]( or [ISK]( reserves.
