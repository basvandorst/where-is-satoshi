Kind of an odd question.  I don't consider one more credible than the other.  They're aggregators so I put both their credibility at zero.
As far as influence and validation, hard to say without numbers.  I'm not putting it out of the question, because anything I say is anecdotal.  My anecdote is that following a handful of bloggers and a few hand-picked subreddits (which generally includes r/tech) is far more common than HN, but that is useless in trying to make an objective claim on how influential a given site is.
But really, all I was trying to say is that my interest in HN has waned recently, and all the Bitcoin bullshit is at least a contributing factor.  It'd be nice to hear about the blockchain innovation, the sidechain (maybe, dunno details), and maybe a few *real* innovations here and there, but it seems that people interested in these things cannot resist posting anything and everything about bitcoin even if its of questionable interest.  If what it takes to avoid that situation is a hard and fast "no bitcoin" rule than so be it.


Its kind-of funny, because my observation is that every tech site goes down pretty markedly in quality once they become popular.  Before Hacker News it was tech subreddits, and before then it was Slashdot.  Maybe I'm just a hipster?  ;)

Hacker News is a good example of Frankeh's point.  Bitcoin evangelists pile into it posting and up-voting terrible, uninteresting articles.  The quality took a noticeable hit when the evangelists decided to start cross-posting there.
And I wouldn't say that Hacker News has *that* much street cred.  It gets the interest of a subset of the SF start-up crowd, but thats really a tiny sliver of tech.

Well we have different opinions, obviously, but I've been reading HN for years, so your insinuation that I'm a newbie is a bit odd.
Informally, I'm pretty much the only person in my circle that I know that reads HN regularly.  I hear a lot of people claiming (on Hacker News, of course) that its influential, but it really comes off as another manifestation of the insular nature of the start up culture, to be honest.
Edit:  All anecdotal, of course.  I'm not saying that I'm necessarily right, but neither of us is really giving evidence for our claims anyway.

No, which is why this sort of announcement is silly.  ApplePay users do not care about merchant fees.

It should not take Top-10 vendors 122 days either.  The fact that they suck is not an excuse for blockchain.info to suck.
A lot of the discussion here from people (other than the OP) claiming to have found security issues and getting deafening silence is painting a pretty poor picture of the security team.

Their site is designed to offer bounties in both dollars and Bitcoins for finding security vulnerabilities.  Its likely they are subject to AML requirements as a result of that.
However, I would argue that an option to forfeit bounties and remain anonymous is necessary, especially if you're going to have companies like blockchain.info using it as a single point of contact.  There are very good reasons that a security researcher may want to make a report anonymously despite forgoing a small amount of money.

That is how its fucking defined, FFS.  I work in technology, but have worked at a bank, so have finance contacts.  That is how they defined it.


I don't really care to debate your point.  People throwing out words that they don't understand,  and passionately defending that misunderstanding, is a pet peeve.  That's my only stake in the game.  And on that point, You Are Wrong.

Apparently most of r/bitcoin did not get it.  Well played.
(I didn't get it until you spelled it out :(  )

Yes, that is what they should do.  It is a pretty big oversight to require that information up-front.

It presumes a couple of things, mainly that the Winklevoss are well versed enough on money and Bitcoin to be effective presenters, and also that the target audience is not well-versed on these things so that the subject matter is appropriate and not condescending.  Neither of these things appear to be true.

Its somewhat similar to the reason one might want to buy GLD rather than actual gold bars -- it takes effort to actually hold the physical metal.  Likewise, it takes effort to hold significant amounts of bitcoin safely.  Someone might want to have bitcoin in their portfolio but don't want to take the risk of managing their own bitcoin holdings or trusting an online wallet.  The dollar amount in your brokerage is insured, and  the ETF is regulated, which presumably means they won't vanish into the night with your bitcoin.
Also an ETF might open up options for putting ones 401k or whatnot into Bitcoin too.

You are wrong.
