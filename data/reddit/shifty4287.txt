You know who mines a block if you know the owner of the address that received the coins. Those coins remain in those addresses to this day. We don't know if Satoshi is a single person or an entire organisation. All we know is major amounts of coins where mined by Satoshi and/or other early anonymous adopters, and they haven't moved. These founders have huge amounts of cash these days if they still control the keys, there is no denying that.

@_date: 2014-11-14 00:28:34
A normal ledger requires you to trust the controlling party. The blockchain has miners constantly verifying the work of their fellow miners, securing the ledger without the need for trust. Of course without the currency there would be no incentive and therefore no miners, but ignoring that, the genius of the blockchain is in the removal of trust.

There's some good advice here, but one suggestion I didn't see was to take a break from the community. If you spend any time on this subreddit or any similar communities, you are constantly bombarded extreme optimism and reasons why Bitcoin will change the world. It's  hard to make rational decisions in such an environment. Some time away from the community will let you settle into a more rational mindset.

No problem, glad i could help. A good way to check which altcoins are worth looking at is to check their [market cap]( a decent market cap usually means a coin is backed by a strong community or has some decent features. Anything other than the top handful of coins is what we refer to as shitcoins. They all have their own forums or subreddits should you want to learn more. I personally find altcoins to be a bit of a waste of time as I'm no developer or trader, and it can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the news.
For general bitcoin and cryptocurrency news; this subreddit, [BitcoinTalk.org]( and are probably the most widely used. There is plenty of others out there but anything worth reading will show up on these sites anyway. The best place for active discussion would be [Freenode IRC]( it has hundreds of active cryptocurrency channels to choose from.

There is **Bitcoin** (the decentralised payment platform) and **bitcoin** (the currency). I consider bitcoin a currency, as it can be used as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.
You are basically claiming that it is not a currency because it is not a reliable store of value. It's definitely far from stable, but this is no different to many national currencies around the world. If the national currency you use was less stable than bitcoin, you would probably not be converting to a spot price at all.
Over time as more people adopt bitcoin it will stabilise, but until then, you will probably use it like you would a currency in a foreign land - constantly converting purchases in your head to your native currency for a better idea of the value.
To sum it up, Bitcoin is a payment platform and a currency combined.

The amount isn't overestimated, it's based on the addresses he is known to have controlled, and the amount they currently hold. Mining these days doesn't even come close to the profitability of mining a few years ago and hodling, you barely break even with the amount of hashing power required.

Bitcoin is the first and most established cryptocurrency. As it is completely open source, people are able to copy the bitcoin code to make altcoins such as dogecoin and litecoin. These are just clones with slightly different features such as improved anonymity or different mining reward systems. Because they are copies and because of the way most cryptocurrencies function, they are generally less secure systems and have far more volatile prices which exposes them to attacks and manipulation that are impossible with the amount of mining power and transaction volume Bitcoin has these days.
Altcoins are pretty much experiments to see how certain concepts would work, and if a coin has a useful feature that Bitcoin could benefit from, it will probably be added in eventually.


I don't think there is a specific point where a currency becomes stable, it is really your own perspective based off currencies you deal with.
Most larger western currencies are highly stable as governments are able to control production as they see fit. As a deflationary currency with no central authority Bitcoin may never be that stable, but as adoption increases it will improve. Most people consider this instability a small price to pay for all the benefits Bitcoin brings.

@_date: 2014-12-17 14:03:30
I feel you are confused on the definition of pseudonym so I'll ignore that first part other than pointing out that multiple people can control a single address.
As with Schrodinger's cat we cannot say whether the early addresses are alive or dead, so for the sake of argument we will assume they are alive. There was only a handful of people mining back then, mostly developers who were deep within the field of cryptography. Those people own that mass of coins that hasn't moved. That mass of coins shared evenly amongst the people who were mining in the first weeks and months would be enough to make all of them rich and powerful. Satoshi could be one or several of these early developers.
Anyway, I feel that we are missing the point by focusing so much on Satoshi. The fear is that someone anonymous has a great untouched wealth. OP did mention Satoshi, but it honestly doesn't matter if the owner is Satoshi himself.

Too many people in this thread have no idea how to speak to a computer illiterate mother. Show her simplicity, don't try to educate her.
I think it's a terrible idea to lend money to invest, but if you must, just tell them it's easy to buy or sell at any time, perhaps briefly show them coinbase or circle or wherever you plan to buy, and just explain that you are completely confident that it is not a scam. They either have to take your word or research, and if they are anything like my parents, research is highly unlikely. At the end of the day it's their money and their choice, and I really recommend you just stick to buying it on your own.
