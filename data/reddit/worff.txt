OP needs to lock his money up.  He can't be trusted with it.

Look, you fucker -- you fucked up.  Now if you want to do the right thing, you will give your sister at least 60% of whatever sum you end up with after gambling away the rest.
If not more.  You want her to incur debt because you blew three quarters of a million dollars?  If you get down to $150,000 -- meaning you lost $600,000 -- then you should give all of it to your sister.  You gambled away yours and most of hers already, how can you justify falling back on 50/50?
You're a hypocrite.  You took it all and gambled it away, and you plan to split it evenly if you continue to fuck up.  You lost your right to a 50/50 arrangement when you decided to gamble with the entire inheritance rather than just your portion.

You lost $410,000.
It should have occurred to you that trading was not your forté and you needed to either stop it or learn more about it or adjust your tactics -- after your first major loss.
You are not some hot shot trader.  You clearly do not have the experience to play this high risk game, and you're fast running out of the funds to play it with.  You've already lost more than many earn over several years, and you're jeopardizing your relationship with your surviving family.
Do the right thing.  Put away enough to pay for her college IN FULL and do it RIGHT NOW.  Put it in a CD that you cannot touch for the next few years, and it'll even go up in value.

And then you said you'd split it 50/50.  At least, if you get to the point where you've lost over half a million dollars -- do the honorable thing and give it all to your sister.

So could I every time I pulled the lever at various slot machines in Vegas one weekend.  Fortunately, I was smart enough to get out after losing my designated loss limit -- which was high enough to have fun, but not so high that it would ruin my weekend.


Your reasoning is not sound.  People acknowledge that even those who succeed at this game are gambling, because you cannot really predict money markets.  Better than stock markets, but it's still a gamble.
Because you are taking a risk that may not pay off.  If there's a chance that you will fail, you are gambling.
