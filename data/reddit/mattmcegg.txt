The closure of the Bitcoin (BITCN) exchange Mt. Gox has scared a lot of people, and hurt some who held Bitcoins on the exchange. What happened is a shame and possibly a crime, but it doesn't really speak to the viability of Bitcoin as a form of currency. If a bank closed in the U.S. due to embezzlement would we conclude that the U.S. dollar is non-viable? Of course not.
Diametrically Opposite Views
A recent article on SA "Get Out of Bitcoin Now" began by asserting that Bitcoin was not viable due to security risk, and that the currency was borderline illegal. Assuming that the author was referring to legality in the U.S., I take diametrically opposite views.
Bitcoin and other digital currencies represent yet another example of a disruptive technology, which, by virtue of its novelty is not well understood by many business and technology writers. Let me first deal with the issue of the U.S. government's attitude towards digital currency.
Anticipating the Future
As I point out in my article, "The Future of Digital Currency", private, non-government backed currencies have a long history in the U.S. In the 1800s private banks issued "bank notes," paper currency backed by the bank. Even today, the personal check is a form of private currency, backed by the user's bank.
Far from being hostile to digital currency, Federal Reserve economists were anticipating the advent of digital currency as early as 2007, a year before the birth of Bitcoin. This is documented in a review by Federal Reserve economist Bruce Champ entitled "Private Money in Our Past, Present, and Future". The Champ article is very readable, non-technical, and great for getting historical perspective on Bitcoin.
Although the image of Bitcoin has been tainted by association with criminal activities, the U.S. government has been careful to draw a distinction between prosecution of those activities and its attitude towards digital currency. The recent arrest of BitInstant CEO Charles Shrem for money laundering is a good example. In regard to the case, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated (as quoted from Time):
As alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the Dark Web drug site, Silk Road. Truly innovative business models don't need to resort to old-fashioned lawbreaking, and when bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.
Bharara makes it clear that the U.S. government doesn't consider there to be anything illegal about digital currency per se. My view on Bitcoin's legality: Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the U.S. are perfectly legal and there is no reason to be concerned that the U.S. government will change its attitude.
Security Non-Issues
When Mt. Gox halted withdrawals, it pointed to what it claimed was a security flaw in the fundamental Bitcoin protocol that it claimed had allowed hackers to make unauthorized withdrawals from Mt. Gox. This is the so-called "transaction malleability" issue.
Bitcoin critics were quick to pick this up as proof that Bitcoin had serious security problems that made it undesirable to hold or trade Bitcoins. In retrospect, it appears far more likely that Mt. Gox was using the issue as a smokescreen to conceal its impending insolvency. Whether that insolvency is the result of theft, from within or without the company, remains to be seen.
I reached this conclusion based on the following:
Technical: I have yet to see any credible technical description of transaction malleability that says it can actually be used to steal Bitcoins from anyone's wallet, either privately or institutionally held. On its web site, the Bitcoin Foundation does acknowledge that transaction malleability can be exploited to interfere with transaction processing in a form of "denial of service" (DOS) attack, but even this doesn't result in actual theft.
The Experience of Other Exchanges: Some exchanges, such as BitStamp, did experience the type of DOS described above but were able to make software mods and reopen in a few days. No Bitcoins were stolen, according to BitStamp. The exchange I use, Kraken, never shut down or interrupted service in any way.
The operator of Silk Road 2.0 did recently announce that $2.7 million in Bitcoins were stolen due to transaction maleability. I consider it likely that the Silk Road operator simply made off with the money.
My view on Bitcoin security: It's likely a non-issue in terms of actually compromising a Bitcoin user's wallet or allowing actual theft of Bitcoins.
Caveat Emptor
The Silk Road theft does point out an important caveat that anyone buying or holding Bitcoins, or any other digital currency needs to understand. Bitcoin's creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, clearly intended to enable e-commerce transactions without resorting to a traditional bank or other financial institution. As a medium of exchange, digital currencies work well. The institutionalizing of Bitcoin through the creation of exchanges represents something of a perversion of this intention.
Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to work as much as possible like cash. Like cash, Bitcoins don't know who owns them, and the whole Bitcoin system only tracks Bitcoin ownership through anonymous numerical addresses. Like cash, Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible. If you want your Bitcoins refunded, all you can do is ask politely and hope for the best.
Making a Bitcoin deposit at an exchange is like making a cash deposit at a bank. You're trusting the bank or exchange to keep track of your deposit and give it back to you on request. Those who made Bitcoin transfers into Silk Road were treating a criminal enterprise as if it were a bank. Not a good idea.
Does the fall of Mt. Gox portend the end of Bitcoin? Of course not. When last I checked on Kraken, Bitcoin had bounced off its post-Gox low of $485 and was trading at about $585.

just because it's cheaper at that moment doesn't mean it will always be that way. the price difference between all exchanges fluctuates as much as the price itself.

yes and no. Amazon is trusting that your credit card is legit and is approving your transaction and that your bank will deliver the funds. They ship the product without the dollars hitting their bank because they want to give you the best customer experience possible. 
look, my honest opinion, the best reason to use bitcoin is because when it reaches its tipping point, Bitcoin will unchain humanity from a financial system that is DESIGNED to leave some people behind. Most people who are really pro-bitcoin have done a ton of research and understand the banking systems implications on our current world. If you really want to understand why Bitcoin is awesome, you have to first understand why the current banking system is horrible. Read up on fractional reserve banking, the federal reserve and their printing of money out of thin air (hurting your efforts to save for the future and for your family). It is theft in the most sinister form.

a little on the backstory, it mostly originated one day when there was a sell wall at $300 on Bitstamp for about 8 hours from, whats expected to be, THE bearwhale.

was asserting an absolute that there are only 2 ways to be rich. if i can find 1 example of another way, he's wrong.... is it hard to move up in america? of course. do most people stay in their "class"? yes. the government has created a dependent class that doesnt have any incentive to self-educate, self improve, or strive for more. in fact, it's actually profitable in this system for people to have kids they cant afford to feed. do you think these children have motivated and involved parents, especially when it comes to school? I think not. Further, regulations, red tape, licensing, and other barriers to entrepreneurship in the lower classes prevent mobility and self-dependence. Also, the government causes an artificial increase in the cost of higher education by making loans too available, and as a result Universities can simply charge outrageous price, but no one cares because free money. and of course this is all in order to protect big business thats in bed with the government in order to suck the life out of the american people and even moreso future generations. lastly, we are all responsible for our actions, and i feel like his mentality is a cop out.

Senior officials at a top US financial regulator are discussing whether Bitcoin, the controversial cyber-currency, might fall under their regulatory remit.
Bitcoin “is for sure something we need to explore”, Bart Chilton, one of the five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) told the Financial Times. A person familiar with the CFTC’s thinking said that the regulator is “seriously” examining the issue.
Said Mr Chilton: “It’s not monopoly money we’re talking about here – real people can have real risk in these instruments, and we need to ensure that we protect markets and consumers, even in what at first blush appear to be ‘out there’ transactions.”
Four-year-old Bitcoin is attracting the interest of regulators amid volatile booms and busts in the value of the cyber-currency and fresh media interest. Intensified regulatory scrutiny could pose challenges for proponents of Bitcoin, who have praised the currency for its independence from traditional authorities.
In March, a branch of the US Treasury department said that all firms that exchange or transfer the virtual currency will be considered “money services businesses”.
That means they must provide information to the government and introduce policies to prevent money laundering. It could also make it risky for other financial institutions to do business with firms that are not in compliance.
Since the ruling, at least three companies in North America have reported having their business accounts closed by their banks. Bitfloor, a New York-based Bitcoin exchange, said it was shutting down entirely, and it has not yet been able to return funds to customers.
Roger Ver, founder of Bitcoinstore.com and an angel investor in Bitcoin start-ups, said that he knew of some entrepreneurs who had moved to Panama to explore setting up operations outside of the US.
“Even if US regulations make it hard for Bitcoin businesses to operate in the US, that doesn’t mean it will make it difficult for people to use Bitcoin as a currency in the US. Bitcoin is a world currency,” he said.
The CFTC regulates derivatives contracts and, under Dodd-Frank financial reform, has sweeping authority to oversee retail foreign exchange dealers.
CFTC jurisdiction generally does not extend to cash markets unless exchanges list derivatives contracts based on them. For example, the agency monitors physical oil transactions insofar as they influence crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
One person familiar with the discussions said Bitcoin would not become subject to CFTC jurisdiction unless it becomes the basis for a derivatives contract. The use of Bitcoin to pay for ordinary goods is outside the commission’s bailiwick.
Leveraged Bitcoin transactions that settled in more than two days – so-called “rolling spot” transactions – would also fall under CFTC jurisdiction, the person said.
Said Mr Chilton, the commissioner: “In essence, we’re talking about a type of shadow currency, and there is more than a colourable argument to be made that derivative products relating to Bitcoin falls squarely in our jurisdiction.”

@_date: 2013-10-30 04:25:10
yup. general advice is that you shouldn't leave your coins on an exchange (MtGox or bitstamp). If you're actively day trading, you really have no choice, you need to keep them on the exchange. 
My personal advice (take what you will) is that keeping them on a trusted site like Bitstamp is probably fine as long as you have 2Factor authentication enabled. Also, electrum is a good wallet to keep your coins on  your computer, thats not necessarily an "offline" wallet. Electrum is nice because it doesn't require you to download the entire blockchain (i think its GBs in size). It uses a remote server for the blockchain, and then stores your coins locally on your computer.

nah thats standard. it usually wont take a full week. they tell you the maximum amount of time it will take.

i see your point, but I feel it was a lack of technical stability and not lack of confidence in the usefulness or value of bitcoin. after the initial drop from 250-200, people were just selling so they could buy at bottom prices.
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:54:59
or they write a bunch of posts ahead of time, and set them to private until its their time to be released.
how is the price relevant to this?

that will take a week or more, by which time the gox price will probably be above where u sold it on bitfloor.
the fact of the mater is that if it were easy/plausible, the price at bitfloor would be lower. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:20:49
you dont realize that speculators provide the market enough liquidity so people (including merchants) can quickly and easily exchange BTC &gt; USD. If this wasn't possible, merchants would be frustrated waiting for a week for their sell order to complete. some volatility is good.

free market currency != volatile.
the only reason its so volatile today is because a single person with a million dollars can swing the entire market.
once the market cap is like $800 billion, that wont happen.

doesn't there reach a point where it just makes more sense to hold and use bitcoin? for instance, if they were at $100k per coin, their buying power would be immense. you might actually not want to "cash out" at that point since bitcoin would have equal or greater buying power to the fiat you'd get in exchange.

The difference is that you can keep dividing Bitcoins smaller, but you really can't keep breaking down gold (it would be impractical and at a certain point, impossible). so as wallets are lost, coins become more rare, value goes up and they can be divided smaller. kinda makes it so there's actually and infinite amount of "coins".

market depth
basically, the supply and demand for bitcoins... the green line of people wanting to buy moves up and to the left (more people want to buy at lower prices) and the red seller line moves up and to the right (more people want to sell at higher prices)
if you're like me you're probably wonder why you never learned this in any econ class, and i think its because Bitcoin gives us the unique view into the standing Bids and Asks placed on gox (or any exchange)

first off, this far in the future, we are probably talking about the difference between a 10 second transfer, and a 2 minute transfer, since computers and the network will be much faster then. secondly, if "rich people" are willing to spend 1BTC on a fee, this would cause enough circulation in wealth and over time would correct itself.

people on reddit are generally risk adverse, so if YOU want try it, go ahead. if you look at the 24 hour chart on mt.gox you can usually spot about a 5 hour cycle of up and then a slight correction. the hardest part is identifying the peaks.

To be honest, buying a miner to pay for expenses is a bad a idea. But you should accept bitcoin for your business! the reason is because cost of transactions is drastically lower than paypal or credit cards. coinbase or bitpay lets you covert your bitcoin to USD by the next business day.

other than that, if you trust this seller, than its better than just letting BTC sit, unless you would plan on cashing them out if there was a panic sell off (which it doesn't sound like you would do)
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:38:37

trickle down just means people buy things from other people, and people with more buy more. the issue in the USD economy is that the rich are fantastic plumbers, and have essentially rigged the game so they cant lose. One example would be fractional reserve banking, where bankruptcy is literally built into the system (theres never enough money to pay back all the loans and the interest payments). You dont see any "trickle' because the rich simply get richer. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:15:05

i like where you're heads at, for real. but isn't being "productive" in a *true* economy just meeting the needs of others? isn't that a good thing? if something is truly fruitful or beautiful wouldn't/shouldn't someone pay for it? if someone doesnt want to meet the needs of others, fine, but they shouldn't be rewarded, especially not by force (taxation).
still, i value a lot of people who don't make a lot of money or aren't productive... thats subjective and people earn respect and value in other ways.

it wouldn't benefit me to sell now tho. It would actually hurt me. and i believe holding is the better short and long term option for me, as someone who bought in at $11 and $40, selling now is picking up nominal gains at the cost of my principles. holding like krazy glue bitches.

so he wants to sell on a high, which is traditionally sound investment advice... do you really blame his reasoning? surely you wouldn't want to sell at a low, so he technically isn't giving you bad advice.
you feel it will go higher... and you have your reasoning. there's really no point in arguing. ultimately he wants to see you make money and not get burned by a potential crash, so give him a break.

because BFX offers an additional order book outside of bitstamp with even lower fees and is a hedge against bitstamp crashing (either in price or technology). also, you're paying for other services like margin trading and lending. charging .05% more fee is how they charge you for that.

there's a new exchange  that gives you essentially "interest" on the coins you keep on the exchange (it's actually a % of the fee revenue, not technically interest). if you're gonna keep coins on an exchange, might as well earn on them.

why wouldnt butterfly labs just mine with all these themselves if they are so profitable?
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:00:48
well I for some news for you. selling your ideas and yourself is the best skill you can have. humans are social creatures and if you can't communicate why you love something your ideas are useless. we all need each other. 
if you don't take control of your reality someone else will. I've had enough of our current system so I can't live and let live, sorry.

yes they will go before the bitcoin tribunal and be punished accordingly. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:49:27
theres a social taboo on money and talking about money, which is one of the obstacles bitcoin has to overcome. in this monetary world, money is access, and sharing access is fun for everyone.

honestly, someone should just send Ron Paul a casascius coin and tell him to put it in his pocket. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:24:25
yea maybe but saying "i have 770 shares" is misleading if they're 1/100th.... most the time you refer to shares its a full one... regardless of some jank exchange lists them as.

Acting like a "mob of thugs" is relative i guess. I see it differently. 
the problem is that the scammer isn't driving people to his fake site via google search traffic. its from direct SMS of the URL. unless google has some power over DNS that i'm not aware of (possible) i don't see that being very effective. 
I didn't accuse you of anything, I just can't understand why you would want the site to stay up any longer than it has to be. ???????????
