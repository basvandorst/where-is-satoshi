boycott coinbase, simple as.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:48:20
just get it already, what are you waiting for - a drop in pence? just buy and watch your wealth do gymnastics because you clearly aren't with that mindset. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:13:26

@_date: 2017-03-25 19:29:54
this is incorrect, you should in fact go 95% in; not 30%..

@_date: 2017-04-27 06:17:10
for the love of satoshi, store your coins on a smartphone wallet app atleast.. If you leave coins in coinbase - coinbase owns your coins, not you !
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:33:48
spend 4k on bitcoin and hold it, honestly.
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:01:28
thank you so much, I have a HW.1 with alot of coins on it and I needed something practical and protective at the same time! I will give this a go!

Why is anyone invested into bitcoin if it isnt going to make us all filthy rich? I mean come on now. You are asking dumb questions, you 'saw' it at 30$ and youre still asking if its a good investment? I mean COME ON. If you're not researching into Bitcoin daily and thinking of investing then you're better off putting all your earnings on red at the casino. Bitcoin is Assured, gambling for a pay off isnt.

The ATM's have screens and camera's which read your QR and printers that print out receipts, and cash dispensers and you can also put cash into them. Try one out its totally anonymous if you want to dodge the extreme KYC going on at the moment on exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:11:06
it got accepted
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:23:06
There must be plenty BTC ATM's around you that pretty much charge the same premiums on buy and sell as users on localbitcoins, try googling 'bitcoin atm near me' 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:06:13
But I do also buy $100 every week or so in Bitcoin so I dont even watch the price anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:21:51
its really not worth the hassle getting your finds slowly dripped back too you, unless youre on petahashs dont bother

Can you spend gold as easy across the globe like Bitcoin? Has gold performed better than Bitcoin since 2008?  Is the Gold market manipulated?

Must suck to be you, I saw Bitcoin at 80$ bought in a fuck ton at $400 now its almost $2000 - I could not imagine being worried as Bitcoin is the most exciting thing of our time.
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:08:31
this is trash, just save your coins

i want $50,000 if its 'only' $50,000.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:19:22
You are not making sense! put your 250$ into Bitcoin yes. But why think its going to crash? Thats never happened since its inception. Why would everyone even hold it if it was going to crash? its going to be a very huge deal and is one right now, If you dont buy now then you're just going to regret it when you could have had more if you had just bought at this moment.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:42:59
it will only be higher in 6 months lol, best time to buy is NOW.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:43:24
I sold a lot of Bitcoins to people at my University back in October 2016 when it was 600-700$ a coin , I got laughed at, I got ridiculed and certain people even dismissed everything I said thereafter. 
However the group of people who believed in me have doubled their student loans keeping it in Bitcoin and are singing its praises to all of thier buddies, regardless of its ups and downs! 
It's safe to say those people who did not believe in Bitcoin, are currently working dead end jobs to get what Bitcoin achieves in 3 hours of a new day, wishing they bought when I told them. 
I myself got into Bitcoin before the MT GOX situation at 80$ per BTC, living in the UK I was just using localbitcoins at the time so I had no idea about MT GOX. 
Right now I can't imagine my life without Bitcoin. I will HODL till i am ODL.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:39:35
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:05:47
Go all in now, or regret it later.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:53:41
HODL 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:03:07
The price rise is the result of sustainable global adoption
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:05:43

I can only speak for myself, and each time I spend Bitcoin - it hurts. Before I bought into Bitcoin I could not beleive in something I could not hold.. That is until I got my first one then i wanted more then i wanted 10s and 100s of bitcoins now everything I do is in Bitcoin but these days I have not been up too much.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:46:22
Just hold your Bitcoins, don't let anyone trick you into parting with your Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:15:33
dont use coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:42:00
this is a shitpost, stop trying to spread fear - the price rise is a result of sustainable global adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:44:21
when the weak hands sell the HODL'ers keep HODL'ing which will drive the price higher than the weak hands who sold out, you hear this story time and time again about people who sold off regretting that they sold their Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:41:42
if you haven't noticed, the dips have been happening all the time during this rally up it will go down slightly then go up to where it is now and beyond. 
The days where BTC would go to $1000 then dip down too $800 is over. Buy now or regret later.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:54:11
waking up is now the best part of my day
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:41:00
localbitcoins start there
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:33:03
how about you put $10 more into that - If you only have $3 spare - then go buy some food instead. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:58:14
all you need to know, is not to spend your bitcoins on anything other than what your life requires as MUSTS.

sources to why it fell? reasons to why it fell? instead of just saying it 'crashed' to promote FUD. Things happen for a reason newbie.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:01:28
i really wanted a ruby stone from california.. being in Norway; BTC was my only option at that point in time. Really glad I did use Bitcoin and not Paypal since every account I used to make got limited instantly. BTC is KING!
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:21:08
most likely localbitcoins

@_date: 2017-06-19 07:51:38
its always the best time to buy, if you know you will make money (which is why you are investing) then why worry about fluctuations in pennies?

if you want to watch your fiat's value slowly turn into confetti then no.

Then why post it? you're trying to recruit people so you can ruin thier lives and wasting thier time frantically looking for more people to say thier ponzi is paying out and then the viscous cycle continues - you're a scam artist getting scammed by bigger scam artists. Go ruin your families lives with this bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:20:02
