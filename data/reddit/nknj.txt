I have been working with Bitcoins in West Africa for a while and personally believe that a website that sells Bitcoin and has all sorts of guides and bitcoin use cases relevant to Iranians would work better than an ATM. 
Our first instinct was to get an ATM and put it in a crowded mall too, but it was too expensive to get one and so, we built a website instead that allowed people buy/sell Bitcoins with mobile money. It was quite a success! Does Iran have a popular e-payments solution you can integrate with for online payments? 
Also, be careful of regulation, some governments act adversely to Bitcoins, primarily due to the lack of information on the topic. If you can manage it, it would be awesome if you could organise a 'Bitcoin 101' session with the central bank that debunks some of the common myths.
PM me for more info, happy to help.

I am guessing Bitpay is obliged to ask this information and do non-documentary checks? As someone who runs a Bitcoin donation hub for Sierra Leonean charities, this is frustrating and complex, but every lawyer I talk to says that there is a need to get this info from American residents.

AFAIK (and I am no lawyer), money transfer laws only kick in when you convert BTC to fiat. So P2P BTC transactions are fine, but when you send it to an exchange/payment processor/remittance company and they help you convert the BTC to fiat, they need to KYC the person sending the BTC (you).
KYC includes things finding out the source of funds in suspicious circumstances. So you might face troubles there if you are an intermediary. But if the amounts are small, you are unlikely to raise eyebrows in the compliance departments of these companies.
You should confirm this with a lawyer, if you actually plan to do this.
