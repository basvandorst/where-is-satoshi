I wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion.
From a customer's perspective, you're doing a forex service and a cash vending service. This is pretty common and well understood. Let's run that with some numbers.
Suppose that I have about 0.5 BTC and I'd like to withdraw that. I have a few choices. I can convert that BTC to USD ahead of time or I can use a machine like this. Let's look at both options for a withdrawal.
**Using Coinbase:**
* Send the BTC to a coinbase wallet and wait for enough confirmations
* I convert the BTC to USD on coinbase. The sell price is $225.96 and the spread is four cents, so I end up with $112.98.
* I transfer the USD via ACH to a traditional bank, such as Schwab and withdraw the cash for free. (or let's say that I use one that doesn't and pay a $3 fee for a total of $109.98)
**Using a Bitcoin ATM:**
* I send the BTC to a wallet usable from an ATM, such as romit.io, and wait for enough confirmations (or alternatively, use a paper wallet, though then you need to have set one up and have a machine that accepts it)
* I withdraw the BTC using the ATM and pay 7% from the coinbase sell price, since most of these systems are using coinbase anyway, so I end up with $105.07.
After all's said and done, I have about $8 more in cash in the optimal case and about $5 more in cash in the suboptimal case using a regular ATM.
Is this service neat? Definitely. Is it more cost effective for the average consumer? Well, $5-$8 can easily buy a lunch.
There's no free lunch, but personally, I'd happily use this service to exchange 0.5 BTC for the price of a latte ($3 or so), but not a lunch.

Sales tax doesn't magically go away because you added 6%. Now you have to pay that plus the fee.
I'm not saying that there is a 6.x% profit either. Running those things is expensive and I agree that there's a lot of overhead.
I disagree that customers think it's the right model when there are others that provide a service like this for much less, even if it piggybacks on other infrastructure.

The ATM at Spitfire in Seattle. I've used it exactly once, paid the 10% margin, and decided it was more expensive than using Circle :)

If you're serious, I'd be interested in checking it out :)

It took two days to load for me, but apparently you can't actually see transactions on it without registering with transforex, which is a pain in the butt without a Chinese phone number of some sort.
It's a neat idea, but given the long loading times and that the funds are held in USD instead of BTC, it's mostly just novel.

Yeah, this. I hope the credit card concierge that comes with some Visa and Amex cards does this at some point. The concierge with AMEX is mostly useless right now because you have to call them on the phone, confirm your card number, and then they enter a task with a 24 hour turnaround.

I think this is where there's a disconnect between what everyone else is saying and you're saying.
The ATM is not the exchange. Most of these ATMs use something like romit, and romit (for example) uses coinbase. Romit does pass along fairly high fees to their customers, but you're conflating the cost of the trade and the way that the business works.
The cost of the trade is much lower than 7%, so rolling a 6.X% margin on top of that is simply too high for most customers. The regular ATM model of charging for the cost of the trade plus a flat fee for the overhead will probably be the model long-term if BTC ever gets out of the fringes.

The point is that a dollar doesn't care if it was spent on sales tax or forex, it's a dollar you no longer have.
I wish you and XBTeller luck, but I probably won't be using your services anytime soon :)

I can go to Canada right now, walk up to an ATM and withdraw $124 Canadian dollars for my $100 US dollars. There is a forex component and there is a spread of less than 1% between bid and ask.
Explain to me again why it's better to use a model that has an unreasonably large spread? It might be better for the owner of the ATM, but if the customers don't think it's reasonable, well, that's an expensive $14k piece of hardware sitting around doing few transactions.

And 7% is somehow cheap?

Too bad you can't bring fruits and vegetables back to Seattle :(

I just got the card. What's weird about it is that they encourage you to deposit 5 BTC to the card. Seems like for a plain scam, sending the card would be overkill.

Okay, so I managed to get a candy bar with it. Registering it on transforex is interesting. You have to say that your mobile number is "Other" and you will get an e-mail that will probably go to your spam.
"Payment Password" is the PIN number shipped with the card when you go to register it.

7% is a pretty steep spread for withdrawing over the 0.018% coinbase is charging. Even for a deposit, it's still only 1% on coinbase. I get that an ATM isn't free to operate, but a flat fee on top of the asking sell price is more fair than percentage points on the whole transaction. I'd be happy to pay 0.1% or so plus a $3 per transaction for a service like that.

Liquidity is already there. Coinbase does these types of transactions everyday. 7% wouldn't begin to handle the downside risk of running your own exchange on an ATM.

Well, to be precise, I currently pay about 0.01% right now on top of Circle/Schwab for more or less the same thing with plus or minus some travel time.
Schwab is happy to eat ATM fees because they make money in different ways, but I could imagine some folks using a company that is less generous.
Personally, 1%+$3 is the upper bound of what I would pay for convenience and 7% is right out unless it was a particularly small amount.
I think the volatility of BTC may be a reason for those numbers being acceptable for some folks, since if you're up by more than 7%, it seems okay.

Yeah, doesn't look like they're taking US residents anymore :(
