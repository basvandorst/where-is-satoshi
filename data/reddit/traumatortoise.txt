Hey guys, do you have any plans to support any of the major altcoins in future releases? Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, etc?

My takeaway from the article is that his hostility is not directed towards sidechains so much as people who make statements like this:
["You created a potential competitor, an existential threat to bitcoin, OF COURSE we would eat your innovation. Face it, it's over. You've lost."](
As someone who supports Ethereum, XCP, and is very interested in what sidechains might bring to the table, it bothers me when people in the community argue that creating altcoins/alternate blockchains is bad because it "distracts from" or "threatens" Bitcoin.
Not accusing you of doing this, but I've seen people express this point of view a lot around here, and after reading Vitlik's article I didn't get the impression he was trying to prevent sidechains.

If you think Bitcoin is going to die, do you think another crypto will replace it, or do you think all cryptocurrencies will die off?

Let's say I wanted to create a desktop client with the same basic functionality as  [cryptofolio ]  ( the [code] ( it's written in PHP.) Would Python be a good choice or is there another language that would be better for the job?

Wow, this is very exciting to hear. I'm already very happy with my Trezor purchase so far and its great to see you guys are working so hard on new features. Could you give me a rough timeframe on when this functionality might be up and running?

Based on my understanding, anyone will be able to create their own "lightning network" since it's open source (I think this is the layer 2 you are referring to). You won't be looking at just one, but potentially hundreds or maybe even thousands of lightning networks. There are already a few different implementations out there.

I think operating their own hubs is one of the ways they hope to make money, you're probably right those will be subject regulation. They might also be looking at providing consulting to companies looking to set up their own networks, or other types of software services. 
You raise good questions, they haven't put forth a clear business model as far as I know. Did you see [this](
edit: I also agree with luke-jr's statement about their primary goal.
