WOW! Much People Really Buying Donuts Dogecoin
Popular donut shop Strange Donuts in St. Louis, Missouri is now accepting dogecoin for Donuts. I can’t believe I am even saying that. I guess it was inevitable, after all, the community has already sponsored Olympic Athletes from India and Jamaica with dogecoin.
I read on Yelp that the “the staff was super fun and friendly and they have quick service, too!” Not too expensive either, an original glaze donut will set you back around 750 doge, but if you want to really splurge, you can order their chicken and waffles for 3,800 doge. 
This is going to be an interesting experiment for dogecoin. I am curious to see how much of the $54 million in coin market cap they have is spent on donuts.

It's a long shot. My thinking was if more people buy domestically mined bitcoins, less rupees will be spent on importing gold. this will strengthen the rupee because india will have to sell less rupees to buy dollars to buy gold.
I am not saying massive regulation, the Bitcoin community and total Bitcoins in India is small, super small. The media has it all wrong. 
The faster we get it regulated here the better it is for India.
Some Notes: I am an American who happens to be living in India. 
It's less about the jobs and more about by how providing bitcoin services moves the India IT industry up the value chain.
You are allowed to speak freely against the government here, but if you want to be heard, it is best to play ball.

Too bad not everyone will know how to do this. Once bitcoin goes mainstream, a lot of users won't even know what a private and public key is. The government will prolly be offering FDIC or something similar. [dreaming]

These cards are meant to be fun and a collector items. They are great for teaching newbies about tech public/private relationship.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:18:03
The Bitcoin Card Co. is about increasing awareness of Bitcoin. We designed these Limited Edition Bitcoin Cards as a fun way to promote bitcoin. 
THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY BITCOIN ON THEM! 
They are great for show &amp; tell when you "evangelize"
They work as a paper wallet should!
Great as gifts, especially if you put a little bitcoin on them
Only 50 of each design has been made
Are these cards paper wallets?
YES. “A paper wallet is a way to store Bitcoins that involves printing the
Bitcoin addresses and private keys directly on a piece of paper. When done
properly, paper wallets are one of the safest ways possible to store Bitcoins.
Do these cards have any Bitcoin on them?
NO. These cards are made for people who already own bitcoin and want to spread awareness. They are best used as show and tell or gifts. Each card has a Public Key displayed and a Private Key that is hidden under a scratch panel. They are perfect for helping someone learn about proper storage and security when it comes to owning bitcoin.
Can they store Bitcoins?
YES. These cards are fully functional offline wallets. 
That being said, I do not recommend that you use these cards to store any significant amount of bitcoin. They are not safe for a number of reasons and should be treated as such. 
They are great for promoting awareness (party tricks) and a great way to get someone involved. 
Give someone a card and then scan the QR code with your smartphone and send it a few MilliBit. Show them the transaction on Blockchain.Info and watch their eyes light up.
BUT Please don’t forget to warn them that their bitcoin is not safe.
Depending on their interest or skill level, you can guide them to the best way to generate their own offline wallet. 
ALWAYS! Please teach people to generate a Public and Private Key offline. (At least until the FDIC or other Government Agency is insuring bitcoin at institutions)
Are you going to make more if a card is sold out?
NO. We are never going to run another print of a card that is sold out.
Did Satoshi Nakamoto really sign each certificate?
What do you think?
How long will shipping take?
A long time. At most 15 days and we are always trying to bring that down. Please bear with us. Maybe you will be surprised
Do you offer discounts for bulk orders?
YES. Please contact me through reddit.
Do you make custom cards for my place of business?
YES. Please contact me through reddit.
Do you have a customer service email?
YES. Please contact me through reddit. 
How do I know you are not a scammer?

Where can I buy Bitcoin?
There are many places you can buy Bitcoin. I have had success with these companies. A quick google search and you can find your Bitcoins.
America: coinbase
Global: localbitcoins
India:  unocoin
If I put Bitcoin on the card, how do I spend it or move it?
You can scratch the panel and reveal the Private Key. This is all you will need to import or sweep your coins to a new wallet. It is a great way to teach someone about bitcoin security.
How important is it to learn about creating wallets offline?
I can not stress enough the importance of creating your own offline wallet and securing your own bitcoins. It is worth both the investment in time and money. 
I currently use Armory.
Can I receive Bitcoin on these cards?
YES. Another person could scan your QR code and send some bitcoin to that address.
What are the dimensions of the card?
3 ⅜ × 2 ⅛ in (85.60 × 53.98 mm)
Do you accept Bitcoin?
YES. Please contact me through reddit.

it seems like a lot of moving pieces exist. how much sponsorship costs etc.. the people who have already donated have decided they will put the money towards a water charity if not enough traction comes through on the IPL thing.
i am going to pm all who have individually expressed interest to come to some sort of consensus. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:05:26
no way. these are two influencers who know what they are talking about. this thread will stay out there. why are you so concerned about the foundation?
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:30:50
I think there are enough Bitcoin users who would agree to a totally non-refundable/non-reversible transaction with reputable merchants both on-line and off-line. In my opinion I think this is a HUGE addressable market. If you don't agree with me, then let's agree to disagree.
Right off the bat, so many middle men have been removed from the picture (lawyers, finance guys, inventory guys) You no longer have to hedge against returned merchandise. 
You should pass on the savings from the ease of doing business with us to us. Thanks.
Bitcoin customers will be your best customers, But only if you provide the service you clearly promised you would. I don't meant small print promises. The only reason anyone will do business with you is if they TRUST you. 
FB CEO was right. Move fast and break things. Tell the Corporate HQ Bureaucracy to accept Bitcoin in a few cities at first. Try it out and grow into it.

This article was kind of one sided. Maidsafe guys are really awesome. I had the pleasure of meeting them at the NYC conference and what they are doing for the decentralization movement is bigger than what we could imagine. This is what happens when we all tread new waters. If the SEC was regulating this, I doubt it would have happened, but then again.. I wouldn't want the SEC to regulate shit like this.  
These things are going to happen over and over until we get to a standard for issuing. Hopefully in the near future. This is the price we pay for moving the world forward. We all take on risks. If you don't want to play, you don't have to. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:32:56

ohh god. you and your money stealing. jesus! give it up. i have much better things to do than steal peoples money. i have been selling these cards on ebay for a while now and haven't stolen a penny. you have the right to your opinion.. but now you are just starting to sound like a whiny little bitch. 
i made and manufactured these cards. i am the first one to tell people they are not safe. read the f*ucking faqs you troll. no one is suggesting that people put any significant amounts of btc on them. 
the reason we are giving these cards away is to help improve the FAQs on our website so the entire community can benefit.

Dude. Perception is key. It's a lot easier to write things off when you think about the "big" banking system or "exchange" rates. These are concepts that are foreign to these laborers. It will really have an impact if they don't have to convert anymore.
It would be interesting if there were any studies related to when the EuroBlock switched to euros.

@_date: 2014-02-04 15:23:49
You don't. I agree with you. They aren't safe.I am the one who made them. 
You can read the FAQs and clearly see that these are not safe paper wallets. They are meant for "show &amp; tell" and for collector items. Only 50 of this design will be made. I have 2 other designs pending, just waiting for the batch to get done. I hope to make these cards much better in the future, but to start I just wanted to create something to 1) increase bitcoin awareness and 2) help me make a profit.

actually if you bothered to read. i highly advise that YOU DO NOT put bitcoin in these cards. I am the first one to say they are not secure. They are pretty much for show and tell. nothing like moving 25 cents onto the card and then scanning to show newbies how bitcoin works. 
here are the full FAQs. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:17:22
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:18:14
Actually it is a great idea on every level. You see, for most people bitcoin is very difficult to understand. These cards are a great way to explain the public/private key relationship and more importantly the risks associated with them. 
Whenever I give them to a newbie I move a nominal amount of BTC onto the card, scan the public key and show them where the BTC is on the "general ledger" via blockchain.info. Newbies love this. 
Then we scratch the private key on back import the BTC into a blockchain.info wallet and send it to another address, So they can learn even more.
This really is great way to teach people. I fear as BTC becomes more mainstream people will not be exposed to the public/private key relationship..  I am old school and want to teach as many people about it as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:26:16
blah blah blah blah. clearly you have never used and exchange, coinbase or any other third party bitcoin service. it's cool you must be an amateur who has no clue about what they are doing if you see these cards as threat. you are probably one of those idiots who lost a shit ton of btc in gox. bwhahahahaahahahahha
and doesn't seem like you can read. i used to sell these cards for profit. now the website i founded makes me more money than the cards so i am using the cards to improve the website. 
but it is ok. i don't except your tiny brain to comprehend any of this. tiny brain man. now please reply quickly so my friends and i can continue to laugh at your ignorance and stupidity. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:28:56
come on man :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:57:11
Dude, I am trying to be civil. But you are a total douchebag. If you are so stupid that you don't realize transacting in the same unit of value will have any affect on people's perception of worth you are an idiot. 
As far as factory workers go, put them aside for a second. There are a number of farmers who sell their coffee to middleman only because they don't have access to the buyer or the bank.
They can't or don't sell to the buyer directly because their is way too much friction involved for the 1 acre worth of yield.
Bitcoin will let them sell directly to the buy and the buyer can handle everything else. 
I will go so far as to say that we will start to see collectives of poor people farming themselves out to makes shirts, slippers, match bpxes etc.
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:51:37
That is a decent amount of money. If the intention was to spread awareness with those funds, we should spread awareness of bitcoin.
The group in California putting up those billboards are raising awareness.
Maybe we could have Andreas M. Antonopoulos and  Balaji Srinivasan draft an open letter to the NY TIMES and use the money for ad space.
A donation to Rand Paul or any political figure could help us as well. [EDIT] This is a bad idea

From the website:
This would allow you to seek redress for the market value of your bitcoins up to a maximum exchange rate of  5,000 per bitcoin. At current exchange rates, your storage will cost about  0.017* per month.
We bill you at the end of each month, in Bitcoin. There's no withdrawal fee, but we have a minimum withdrawal size of 1. Liability Limits start at 5,000.
*Calculated using BTC/GBP: £490.

i would say an average persons wages per month here are $1,000 if you went to college and have been working for 5 years. about $200 bucks for everyone else. this is speaking for the bangalore metro area.
outside in the villages it is around $50 bucks per month
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:45:40
yeah. i kind of agree with you. it will crash, but it is here to stay and will run to $10,000 in the next 2-5 years. once my mother and father are holding bitcoins in their 401K we have entered the mainstream. it implies bitcoin is stable, secure and a good store of value. [OPINION]

i live in bangalore. we just a had a great conference with an amazing turnout. there are a lot of speculators, cryptologists, techies, students and, exchanges and numerous other start ups that exist in india. the ecosystem is pretty diverse and deep. india doesn't need to be the savior of bitcoin, bitcoin doesn't need a savior. what bitcoin needs is for india to continue its path to adoption.
numerous people have written about india's restricted capital, their penchant for gold, unbanked opportunity, remittance market opportunity and others.
1.5 billion people live here and we are slowly introducing the most fair and transparent currency/savings vehicle/commodity/technology to this country. only good things can happen for bitcoin. 
i see your points, but the positive and unknown outweigh on my outlook.

if you trust me. send the cash on an overnight bus to my office and i will send you the bitcoin at the average buy sell price on buysellbitco.in. i won't take any commission. if the chennai market is big enough, i will send a driver once a week to pick up the cash.

@_date: 2013-11-20 03:36:09
that does sound like a good idea. i will try to get to it. but here is a short take on the bitcoin scene in india
the bangalore meetup group is in the top ten in terms of size
you can buy bitcoins through your bank on  and there is another exchange called unocoin.com that is launching. these are all domestic exchanges and need to be linked to the rest of the ecosystem, but that will take some time. 
Students are just starting to get into it and there is going to be a huge conference in December at the Sheraton hotel.

i hope so bro. we do love gold. but it has been slow to catch on. after speaking to all the guys who buy and sell we think about 18 months. the problem now is it is hard to do legitimate deals. i do deals in cash to promote awareness and bring it out of the shadows. but at the end of the day the majority of big deals is done with black money. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:52:08

Met the guy on localbitcoins. He came to my office and picked me up on his motorcycle and we ducked into a nearby alley to do the deal. By the time I got home I already made money. My guy told me that a lot of his sellers are turning people away. It's getting painful to do cash transaction in Bangalore these days.

@_date: 2013-11-14 13:41:59
honestly. the blockchain is magical. it's one of the reasons why i am drawn to bitcoin. india is a very corrupt country and i think bitcoin can help wash all the black money that is floating around :)
the blockchain makes every transaction public. there can be no changes. you can just follow the money. 
recently a few companies have started to blacklist public keys. we all know it is going to come to this eventually, but i am not so sure how i feel about this.
