If I am not mistaken, offline wallets (Watch Only) wont have private keys in them. You should have a paper with a root key and a chain code on it. you will need to "restore" this wallet to your armory then you might have some luck with the above link.

what if you live in a place along the equator where its pretty much always hot and you never need heat?

Well, i setup a vm and compiled the linux versions of the software keyconv didn't do it, it spits out an error about a key assertion EC_KEY_check_key. Huh... i guess ill give up on this one.

Coinbase is a new company based on a new technology for money value transit. They might just be minding all the Ps and Qs just because the feel the eyes are all on them.

Is there a keyconv version for windows? I just grabbed the package again from the bitcointalk thread and its not included. Is there any way to do this in windows without having to build everything from source?

It is the weekend, and i look forward to sleeping. :) No need to tip. I am still digesting all this changetip stuff.

The thing is i rarely use that computer. Its not had much if anything unofficial installed on it in a long time. I do use Avast and MBAM. My guess is that someone got a copy of the wallet file some how from when it wasn't encrypted. I know i didn't keep care of it very well. Like i said its a throw away. I guess ill have to give it a go through though and see. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:58:41
Alright well im batting zero. i cannot find anything. :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:19:16
Ahh, so i need to find this application then as it was not included apparently with my vanitygen download. Ill check it out. thanks.

I wouldnt do a brain wallet. I would get armory and create a wallet there and print out the paper restore wallet thingy for it and move all the coin there. Once you get reset on your computer you just use the paper wallet to restore the wallet on the PC and your good to go. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:08:20
Yes, i do. its my cold storage wallet. no problems on that front.

Charging opportunities are usually pretty wide. Especially if you keep your charge cable with you.
Or just carry a spare battery.

I know of a problem when using multibit where if a program tries to update the wallet file some how outside of multibit, it will say the wallet is no longer valid and close its connection to it but i dont think it stops other operations like genrating new keys. I had alot of trouble during some testing i did with multibit like this. i could never figure it out till i realized the the backup of my multibit wallet was causing the problem. It would generate the address then not be able to save it to the wallet.  I dont know if this would be what your seeing as that would also mean i think that the payment public address would also have been lost... but it is something to think about if you have anything like a backup or drop box trying to read your wallet file while its in use by multibit.

That's about right. I started out just like most people playing with the idea and seeing what it was all about. So it seems like from everything i have been able to find i have to wait it out and mine up to the minimum again probably another year at the rate things are going, and then check out permanently, or let this go... guess I'll say my goodbyes. 
Honestly from what i have been seeing even people with the bigger ASIC machines are getting out paced to the point, i have to wonder if mining is ever going to be something an individual can do again. It almost seems like its gone corporate. Buy up a huge farm of ASIC machines and destroy the difficulty. 
On the plus side, i did buy my first coin today at coin base. that was pretty exciting. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:24:28
Working out some details on getting this done now. Not sure how much it will cost really either. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:29:26
That's exactly my point. Outrageous numbers now are tomorrows standard.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:12:45
Thanks. I decided to stick with vircurex since i had already some balance in BTC with them, and made  a trade for my LTC to BTC, pretty happy with the result, got what i think i should have.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:32:19
Perfect. This is what I have been seeking. Thanks a lot for sharing!
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:59:11
Mining could probably be optimized a bit really. How many people out there are still running mining rigs that just don't produce enough BTC to actually pay for the electric? Those folks need to stop and just toss in the towel. I was one of them for a bit and I finally gave up. 
I don't think rules need to be put into the system to dictate who has enough power to hash, but as a community we should try and discourage wasteful mining. From everything I have seen really... that seems to be the case anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:51:01
How much are people spending in hardware to ramp up the mining like this? Isn't there a point where this should level out because its just not worth it anymore unless your willing to invest 30K to maybe break even in a few years?

So, it seems strange to me that he got two big donations, one for 10.0001 and one for 10.0002 both were divided into two donations from the same two addresses and within a few minutes or seconds of each other... That does not make much sense to me.
If you look at those two payment addresses, you see that they get coin, then send him coin, then restock then send it again immediately. 
and 
 
almost makes you wonder if its not an attempt to get this into the news... and into the public eye more... Cannot say thats whats really going on and its obviously not really hidden at all if that is the case but...it just struck me as funny.

News needs to be high level not detailed. If they want to talk about it they need a simple image that represents what bitcoin is used for and as it relates to the day to day of the common person since they likely have no idea how a computer works beyond the power button, mouse and keyboard. They should then reference a good beginners article for people to get more information if they want to.

BTC of the future is completely untraceable! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:49:45
Whats a couple more months right? but i calculated at todays rate since my last payment from the pool, to today, it will take 88 some days to get to the .01 minimum to get a payout again, and that is not accounting for difficulty changes.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:09:34
This is something along what I suspected. I think it all ties back to the Root Chain and Key that you end up with in the Paper Backup. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:33:50
Sweep is the function you want to use, not Import. Import could leave who ever ends up with the private key exposed for issues. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:44:18
I always wonder more about the technology side of things getting much more advanced to the point where maybe what asics did for bitcoin mining...maybe a similar thing happens for general computing so that a computer might be able to hash at a rate equal to asic machines now, and then the asic tech gets updated to match the new general tech and the hash rates jump a lot. 
I don't know that we are at risk of this soon, but I am not sure these "requires the power of the universe" arguments really take account for new technology discoveries that might be outside our current understanding. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:08:08
Yes, i understand how the top level works, I'm curious more about the details of the back end in terms of private key handling and how it actually is creating addresses in the watch only without having to import keys back to the offline wallet. I've searched a lot on this and have had trouble finding a detailed explanation of how it works. While I understand software programming reasonably well, I don't know the first thing about crypto to even make any sense of the source code. if I knew enough about crypto I probably wouldn't have any questions. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:41:47
Yea, I'm not to worried about it really. I'll just wait and see if all these ASIC boxes have some fatal flaw that kills them on a specific date or some type of virus... then we can go back to the good ol' GPU days...and I'll be ready. ;)
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:27:17
Agreed, but the confusing bit is that you can create new bitcoin addresses from either side, and they always match up on both sides.
