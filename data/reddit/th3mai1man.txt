let’s you and i admire the cancerous circle jerk which is all of reddit about “net neutrality”. keep the government out of our internet.

why do you want people to move to the new chain,if i may ask?
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:46:24
much much much further, actually.

i don’t want to be rich in fiat because i think crypto is the future. i just want to trade this failing paper for something i believe will be a lot more valuable in the future than it is now, not necessarily speaking of its value in relation to fiat. with that being said, i believe many people are attempting to trade with bitcoin especially now that more places are accepting it. obviously places wouldn’t be making an effort to accept bitcoin if people weren’t willing to pay with it.

don’t use coinbase. try something like gemini.com or xapo.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:05:21
and what’s your opinion? that 2x should be considered called bitcoin if it replaces main chain?

ig this could be a plausible theory. but there’s no evidence as far as i know to back it up, so i don’t necessarily think it’s true. if you have evidence otherwise i am very open.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:34:34
because it is lmao.

he already said he bought back in tho
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:52:46
not anymore

this is the sensible libertarian stance on the issue, but everyone else seems to always feel like they have to ‘pick a side’. i’m on my side.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:12:45
ok cool. that’s what i think too. i don’t understand the obsession with trying to keep calling bestcoin bitcoin. if you don’t like bitcoin, stop trying to ‘remodel’ it. just make something else.

obama appointed current head of FCC while he was in office so...
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:41:03
duh. and?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:47:03
bch isn’t really out do the race yet though. i promise i’m not a bch shill because i hate them too, and i love bitcoin. but i think it’s dangerous to completely discount something as strong as bch. it’s gaining value at a faster rate than btc rn so...
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:41:26
it’s basically saying if bitcoin is no longer a system for people to perform transactions anonymously, it won’t be worth as much because that’s one of the main points of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:16:16
i would also like to know
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:26:56
“what’s the free market?!?!”
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:42:13
i’m not gonna act like i know a lot about bitcoin or how it works, but this sounds like a really good idea. can someone more informed please chime in?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:08:34
i got a couple senset sasparillas with a star on them. does that count?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:44:59

Take it off of coinbase and put it in a proper wallet. Pretend the forked coin doesn’t even exist as its existence is contrary to the ideals behind bitcoin. you should be in control of your own private keys. when you have bitcoin on an exchange, all you have is an IOU from that exchange. and say that exchange were to get hacked. then you would have no way to get that bitcoin back and *poof* it’s gone forever. this new coin is an attack. don’t make any transaction immediately following the new split and wait for news.
