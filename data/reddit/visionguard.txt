Civilized countries also spend 2/3rds of what major uncivilized countries do on research and development per capita, presumably so they can then subsidize the technological gains from the extra funding those uncivilized countries put into such innovation and have quality medical care at lower cost.   It's a tidy arrangement for those that are civilized.

I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:45:40
What does this mean?
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:18:41
I know.  I think that's bs too.

No....selling is different from buying stuff with it, connotation wise.

Right, that's my point.  We don't walk around saying we're "selling our USD for some bread" when we need bread to eat.  We use the term "buying".
When people say they're not ever going to "sell" Bitcoin, they rarely mean they're not ever going to "buy" with Bitcoin.

compared to what?  Coinbase pro is more expensive, I believe.

This has to be one of the most ridiculous takes I've seen here in quite some time.
Sort of like saying "and it wasn't 400,000 m/s, it was only the speed of light.  And if you think that's close enough, then let's race and see", when, you know, we've never approached the speed of light before, let alone possibly sped past it.

Your hunch is Tom Lee's hunch.  It's not a bad one.

No, active trader is 0.35 percent.

Yeah I find that reasoning a bit weird.  Like, we have plenty of markets that are valued at what amounts to Bitcoin at 500K to 1 million and nobody bats an eye.  Frankly, I think the "number" of "one million" is what freaks everyone out and forces them to make these grandiose claims.
To put this another way, there are 2100000000000000 satoshis that will ever be in existence.  This means that "at Bitcoin at 1 million", it really means each Satoshi is a single penny.  I hardly think that "means" USD is dunzo.
