First I was in it for the drugs. Then I was interested in the technology. Then I saw a market opportunity.... Then I got burnt in the 2013 crash.. Now I just want to pay off the mortgage and have enough money to start up a small business. Who knows.. Might happen.

Yes you can:

You just create the channel once. You don't have to remain online. You can make multiple payments to anyone linked to your node on the network. You can close the channel at any point and you can create multiple channels. For very large channels I believe additional security or trust is needed. But for small channels of a few $100s, I don't think it matters. At least that is my crappy understanding.

Asking on here, you're going to get a really odd mix of wide eyed loons, serious high risk trader/gambler/investors, future watchers, dark market users who's stash money became very valuable, skeptics, trolls and shills for bitcoin cash, etc.
If your intent is to do an article on the total zoo that is reddit bitcoin, and extrapolate that to the technology, you will find ample ammunition for a perspective that most of your readers will be very receptive to.

I think the BTC versus alts narrative came about as a defence from so many of the alts being launched as "bitcoin killers". Their respective shills were always claiming that bitcoin was old tech and they were the new big thing.

SMH ... There are no bitcoins in this vault. They are all on a distributed ledger called the Blockchain.

Lots of interest and discussion about blockchain in the big 4. Even some blockchain projects being run by them.

Read it properly. It's saying that even with a 90% deceleration in usage, we get $6k.

Because you cash it out for less fiat of course. How can people buy bitcoin if people don't sell it. It's a currency not a fucking cult. You're allowed to leave.

The understanding that I think you might be missing (apologies if I am wrong), is that no one really "has" bitcoin. The Blockchain is a public ledger. What you have with your "wallet" is a passcode to move a certain amount of bitcoin from a place (in truth places) on that ledger. You can store that passcode on a computer, on a small hardware wallet (a secure usb stick), on a piece of paper or a tattoo on your arse.
Alternatively you can have an account with an exchange. There will be some kind of user interface where the exchange tell you how much btc they believe you have.
This is why you can have a wallet recovery seed. The passphrase is a way of reconstructing your passcode. You could have two or two thousand hardware wallets with the same passcode and all of them could spend your btc (but only once). The btc itself isn't actually on that hardware wallet.

It's like a retired person with a pension pot. They could scrimp and save and be super careful with how they invest and spend their pot of money, so that when they are 90 they will have almost the same amount they had when they retired at 67. But what's the point of having loads of money when you can barely get out of your chair and you'll be dead in a few years?

How can people buy if people don't sell? Bitcoiners are sadly a reflection of the intelligence of the world at large.

I only use 10% of the wallets I've ever created. Those old wallets have micro dust in them. What's your point?

I am in it for the money. But my biggest regret is that I was almost the second hodler ever. I was the first to reply to the original hodl post on bitcointalk.org as I had experienced the exact same thing. I wrote the post, hit post... But had been logged of the board for some reason. Was too pissed off to log in and repost!

Imagine the price suddenly drops $3000 and loads of news articles get posted up about how the US government is going to shut down bitcoin. Would you :
a) freak out and sell
b) be annoyed that you didn't time it perfectly, but you knew it was volatile and a gamble, and you're in it for the long term
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:08:32
Exactly! Regret!

I think that as well as a simple denomination convention, perhaps we should have a colour convention. So BTC denominations are usually in yellow, mbtc is green, ubtc black and satoshi in white.
Probably unworkable... But an idea.

Yes. You've broken bitcoin. I hope you are proud of yourself.

Bitbargain.co.uk often has traders selling below the Bitstamp spot rate.

Create a wallet that has a recovery seed phrase. Bitbargain.co.uk is an easy place to get btc and can offer rates close to exchanges.

The question is what will be the value after the bubble pop. I think that we have a good year of bubble ahead of us. We could see a lot more exuberance and crazy prices - especially if there is a shock in traditional markets. Say things go up to $30k by September and then there is some institutional intervention that causes a pop - then we might see 50% fall and the next "death of bitcoin". So prices dawdle around $15k, lots of people are disillusioned and people drift away from crypto as a get rich quick scheme. Meanwhile the technical development continues and lightning comes online, etc.  Long term players are not bothered because they have seen it all before.

The more successful these forks are, the more we will see.. To the detriment of bitcoin.

Trading most stocks, currencies or other such assets is largely just coin flipping. Bitcoin is a gamble. You can compound that gamble by trading and potentially make more money, or potentially lose more.
