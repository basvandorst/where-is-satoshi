You know that with stocks, you can't just sell then immediately re-buy, right? You need to be out for 30 days to be able to claim a loss. At best the same rules apply here, but I'm not an accountant.

1) I don't see how you could get away with not having a license in the US. People have been sentenced for running  unlicensed money transmitter operations on localbitcoins.com, and LN looks a lot more like "money transmission" than simply selling BTC directly to people you meet in person, even if the US government thinks BTC is a commodity and not money. It's all a bit weird.
2) You can have a channel open for as long as you want in theory, but you are tying up a certain amount of BTC from the LN operator: if you open a .5 BTC channel for, say, a month, you commit 0.5 BTC on the chain to them and they commit 0.5 BTC to you. (Well, not to them and not to you directly, but to multisig addresses that function as safeguards in case either party disappears.) The idea is that they will charge fees for your transactions, getting compensated for putting their BTC to work. If you don't use the channel their BTC is tied up for no good reason. So it's in their interest to keep a channel alive for a relatively short amount of time, and possibly charge a fee not only for transactions, but for opening a channel in the first place.
3) You don't have to. LN operators are envisioned to connect to each other, so you can send/receive to anyone in a few hops.
I think the million dollar question is: what are fees going to look like? LN operators will have to store a lot of BTC on Internet-connected computers. If you're planning on being one: running a node will be relatively cheap, but matching every channel's needs with your own BTC that you expose to a certain amount of risk will surely require compensation, even if you're a big holder who has nothing better to do with his BTC. I'm sure there will be a way to keep most of the LN operator's BTC in cold storage, but that slows down the opening of channels and requires a trustworthy human operator. (Again, expensive.)

They (Gemini in particular) will credit you immediately and allow withdrawals, no questions asked. They might come back with KYC/AML stuff in a few days but it's no big deal.
For amounts like that though, you're probably better off with OTC trading. Itbit does it, for example, and they're easy to work with. They will find a buyer for you in one lump sum at a rate that you're happy with. No need to worry about crashing the order book or baby-sitting sell orders.

40 megamillions is a lot of money!

Why are there motivational posters in the 2017 cart?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:09:21
The car is from the mid-80s, 400bhp was a big deal then.

Oh if it's an IRA I understand your frustration. You could check with a tax attorney; it sounds like you were forced into an unfair situation and there might be provisions to help you out.

Dude, you need to speak to them. The wording implies that you don't HAVE to do anything if you don't want to close your position, but it's better to hear that unambiguously.
OTOH not sure why you went to a fund and paid their fees when you could have just bought BTC directly. I understand that holding the private keys can be a pain but surely that's not a good enough reason?

Gemini is a good exchange if you're US-based. Easy to work with, fast, reliable, has decent volume, they process payments quickly (both in and out), I have nothing but good things to say about them.
Taxes are capital gains, so 25% if realized within 12 months, or 20% if you've been holding for over a year. Plus whatever your state may ask for; it depends on the state. (You will owe nothing to NH, while CA will want ~13%, etc.)
Moving to another country won't help you escape your liability as the US taxes its citizens worldwide. You'd still have to report your earnings every year, and if the local taxes you paid on your BTC were less than what the US would have charged you, you owe the difference to the Treasury. This assumes that the country in question has double-taxation treaties with the US. If not, you just have to pay taxes in both places.
You could think about moving abroad and renouncing your US citizenship but not only is it a shitty thing to do, it also means you won't ever be able to come back. You decide if 20% of your potential windfall is worth it.

Hmm, apparently secure decentralized system sees attempts at centralization by shady amateurs (mybitcoing, mtgox) and shit keeps going wrong? Did not see that coming.
