1. Setup the core wallet to act as a server within the .conf file. 
 - Read the core wallet README.txt, it explains this
2. Point your mining program at the server. 
 - The README.txt I think also states how to do this, otherwise the mining software will. 
3. Hopefully get a block before you die, or seeing as hashing is essentially random, find 20 blocks in a row and give me a few.

Yes, given enough time and hashes, there might be a collision. Yes given enough time I could factor a large prime and break a RSA encrypted communication. I would go talk to your bank about how they handle your money, sounds like there might be issues.

But miners only collect transactions to block them, they do not send them on (unless of course they do, but thats apart from mining). Miners will just add new transactions to the block they are building, recompute the header, and hash. They dont care if (encode(decode(tx)) == tx). The things(nodes) that should care is the ones propagating information, they should only send transactions that pass that check. That they encode the same as they decode.

I'm a graduate student of CS and I have never seen any issue with hashing information to get a unique ID. Apart from collisions which can be avoided by reviewing the birthday paradox/problem.

"Bitcoin is digitally “mined” by computers running an algorithm. (If you just rolled your eyes, you’re not alone.)"
1. I don't want to live on this planet anymore and I'm taking bitcoin with me.
2. As I read "Lady, hy hey hey, lady, stahhhp STFU stahhhhhppppppp" 
3. This quote outlines the stupidity I see in everyday life, and yes I do it to. It's a part of being human. // When confronted with something we don't understand, the first 95% of people seem to just write it off as almost imaginary in a sense. Its "there", like a Unicorn is "there", its a thing because we all know about it, but we also assume everyone also "knows" its not real, and if you say or think it is you're just stupid or something. But no one can prove its not real. // I bet 95% of you just said, but yeah unicorns aren't real dumbass.. The other 5% figured it out though, they found that a unicorn is a single un-popped popcorn kernel // Be the 5%, or whatever percentage it might be. Convince the other 95% unicorns are real.
She did get a point in there I hadn't heard yet, though in an ad hominem sort of way. Accepting Bitcoins at your business is like some sort of free advertising. The two sides being though, if the amount of businesses accepting it for "free advertising" is greater than the amount doing it because they find it useful and legit. Then the bitcoin market might be as the author of the article thinks; but just in that facet of it. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:39:34
 I've used it, they are very legit. 
Give them the URL of the item you want to buy, they purchase it with their credit card and ship it to you, after you have payed them in BTC.

Indeed, hmmm. 
There are no natural source of something that comes every so often, unless there is a guiser(sp?) of gold or something, shoots like old faithful, and the miners use nets to catch the gold shot into the air... But they are waiving there net randomly, like people shooting in movies.

[OP] I was using mining as an analogy to some sort of work we could do for other redditors, this work I suggested was make reddit better by helping them do some server work. 
The tip goes to another redditor for a good comment, which good comments make the site better. Awarding this btc to other people trying to make the site better is no different I would say. And yes I understand you do not want others to get btc someone might not have accepted, that is why I say the 5 days rule for how long it is up for grabs, personally I feel as with my idea above that it would be worthwhile if the "mining" (work done by people trying to grab the unclaimed btc) is beneficial to the site. 
I fully understand mining. It is the act of performing the SHA256 hashing algorithm twice on the current block's block header and a nonce incremented each try. The result of the hashing is a number of finite length, we are trying to find one with many leading zeros, the amount of which determined by the current set difficulty. Finding a block solver is an extremely low probability event, on the order of 1 in 2^32 hashes being close, and I know this number is probably not close, but it is a number of this extreme size. 
I know the analogy to mining is not direct; sorry for the confusion I was a little drunkardly when I originally posted. I hope this clears up the post.

@_date: 2013-11-25 21:31:31
I am not too versed in this, but I think mining would be 'broken'. SHA-256 is a "one-way" algorithm. It is easy to compute one way and hard to compute the other way (easy/hard in terms of P vs NP time). Allowing for P=NP this means one way algorithms could be turned into two way algorithms. You would be able to find any given difficulty hash in P time. But as others have pointed at, if we make the difficulty target an enormous number it would still take a very long time to compute.

Woah... Woah.... wait a minute. I just deleted a folder in my Program Files two hours ago called BetterSurf. I'm not sure when I got this, it had to have been within the past two or three days. I noticed it in Google Chrome as a huge banner on the top of every website. I did not see it in firefox. --- Just finished the removal, though I did not have the "Swv" folder in my roaming/app folder. I did have the windows task, and I also had the program "Software version updator" which was installed 3/15/2013, so this thing has been there a little further back.

Nothing, unless you are the only person/system that can or has generated your address they are at risk. Unless you have perfect security over all those systems. Such as Electrum. You own the only way to make you addresses, turns out everyone else can to. That's a contradiction, but as long as you keep you password that is randomly generated upon startup then you will never loose them.
