You mean like everyone is laughing in your face because you dissuaded people from making investments generating more than 2000% returns in one year? 
Sure it may crash some day, but you have admittedly given the worst possible advice in the past so maybe learn to be a bit more humble about the fact that you're clueless.

Exactly, if you warned people last year, the people stupid enough to listen to your advice lost the investment of their lifetime. They would have 20x their initial investment in one year. 
So it's great that you can see in retrospect that you gave probably the worst advice ever. The bubble has "popped" 5 times during the last year too btw. Just admit you have no idea what your talking about since you've already admitted trying to persuade people out of getting 20x their money in 1 year, and you didn't know about all the "pops" this bubble has already gone through.

Hi. Sweden here. Free tuition but we can still get student loans if we want to at a 0.34% interest rate :D

It's was already up 2000% in one year, if laughing in faces was your plan then you missed the train about 1800% ago. Whatever happens now won't change that your advice was horribly wrong. Just accept it, buy some ethereum now during the dip, and move on.
Edit: misspelled ethereum

That's great that you went to school and all, it's just that your point would be more credible if you hadn't been wrong around *20 times in a row* by now. 
Sure some day will be the last big crash, but you have no idea when that is. It might be that it crashes down to 250k in 5 years. You haven't got the slightest idea so maybe after constantly being wrong about bitcoin you should learn that.

Wait, do you think the housing crash was about middle and lower class people buying and selling houses to make money, or do you think all bubbles are the same? 
Either way it doesn't really work trying to compare the housing market to crypto currency investing. Sure bitcoin crashes now and then, then it goes back up. 
But if you have numbers on why *this time* you'll be right despite being wrong every single time since bitcoin was ¢10, please share.

That's what people said when it dropped from $2 down to ¢50. Just admit you don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about or what's going to happen. So far it has only gone up, and nobody knows when it's going to stop. But for every crash people like you come along trying to relish in "I told you so" emotions, and every time you get proven wrong.
