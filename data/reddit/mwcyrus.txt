Whales need a really big market share to make a PnD work. They have to ninja buy a shitload of coins without pumping the price so you want to look for low market cap, low volume and little price action during a relatively long time (weeks to months) when they stack coins getting ready for the pump. Look also for buy/sell walls appearing and disappearing, they use this type of signals to tell other whales they are ready for the pump. Previously they shill the shit out of the coin they are going to PnD and make people believe the price is going up because some good news just came out. They love deception.

@_date: 2018-08-08 17:24:19
why would you ban the creator of your own coin? sounds totally retarded

Fear and greed is the same since way before 2014 and is what really moves speculative markets. Both cycles can and should be compared.

btc goes up and down way more than 5% per day and you mind paying some extra to protect the merchant from volatility? Sure there has to be a better way but meanwhile use your btc bro, just hodling makes no sense. If you want to keep your stack you can use it and replace it asap by having fiat ready on your exchange. It is in your own benefit. This gold theory is too risky we don't know if will really happen so why take the chance? The way I see it.

I submitted my bfx verification long long time ago, around nov 2017. Still waiting. It's a total mess. Said so, they have no right to lock an account and ask id, wtf. Totally unacceptable.

tether and bfx are just fine, meanwhile other exchanges and wallets getting hacked left and right, ico scams getting pumped, fraudsters on twitter and facebook...but lets fud tether and bfx! people is retarded.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:35:42
So true! Most shitcoins doesn't even have wallet. BTC is highly speculative but at least has a purpose and use case.

Is not panic if you sell 1st.

I used a btc atm recently to sell some btc and it was amazing. The only con was the wait for confirmation (atm didnt tell.me how.many.confirmations are needed in order to withdraw so I waited 3 confs and it worked just fine).  The fee was around 4% wich is quite good imo for quick cash.

This meme made me lose money. Thanks god I sold before it was too late.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:02:02
Anything could happen. We all agree a big move is coming. Up or down? Place ur bets.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:50:44
This is like BFX fud. Been hearing that shit for years and nothing happened.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:12:18
Haha ok yeah being honest btc cant break 6k. It will never happen again 100% guarantee. Just be honest bro.
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:53:43
Nice. This exchange is the only one I trust with my money. Happy customer. Just waiting advanced orders (trailing stops) to come back and it will be perfect.

I think you are right except that if btc goes to 1.3k the people who really understand btc fundamentals will buy it up. This is probably the reason why it always recovers. BTC fundamentals are just too strong to go to zero.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:56:38
we just found the bottom, congratz!
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:05:35
Calm down. If it doesnt work for you its your problem but many folks out there know how to use it. Its not math but just probabilities to hedge vs the market.

Why dont you try to open a yt channel? Lets see how much better you do.
Im not a fan but I like to follow diff traders bears and bulls to hear their opinions on the market so I can make my own judgement. How is that so horrible?

Comparing 2013 bear market we could bounce hard from 3k to 6k and then another long grind to the bottom around 1000$-2000$, maybe a wild wick to 800$ just to piss off ppl....1 or 2 years more should be fine to flush weak hands and shitcoins
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:14:33
Lol dude....and what about eur? Im not in the usa
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:14:58
Let 's suppose I live in France... so what? Do you think the gov knows about my crypto? Let's even suppose the non french exchanges I use rat on me. Or even the bank... well, let's then suppose I got hacked and lost all my crypto or I lost my private key. Or even better let's suppose I got in at ATH and Im getting rekt. How you like that Macron?
