hence why i said to not get me started sir.

Right, i know its not exactly 1%, all I remember is it was less than 5, and that is absurd. They basically set a trap for everyone and people just stepped in it willingly. There is a difference between protest, and silently ignoring the rules and going about your business. I think a lot of this came from people simply not even knowing how to go about reporting these things, but if they did not actively seek out the information (which doesnt really exist I know), or consult with an accountant and at least report something showing you tried.. well they stepped in the trap.
I think the whole thing is silly, but do not get me started on the bill of rights etc.

I was amazed that only like 1% reported crypto in their taxes.. like, did you think that was a smart thing to do? of course they will hold it against you, if you dont like taxes maybe go to boston harbor. This is not how you protest taxes, this is how you open yourself up willingly to problems. I know this isnt popular, and i really wish the best for all those who got letters, wish they didnt.

I just called the merchant I was attempting to buy from, explained to them that I simply cannot use them unless they can provide me with a physical address as anything else is too insecure for my process. (hardware wallets like anyone with common sense)
They repeated the bitpay wallet installation instructions and I said I will sadly have to find somewhere else to take my business that is more security oriented.

I guess it would be a useful solution for those who run into problems managing their funds. For people like me, who are capable of such things, I have never had a situation where I wished I had a 3rd party dispense and manage my money. I got into bitcoin for the sole reason I would gain more control over my wealth. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:06:32
yea im mixing up terminology in my head with a number of things right now. nothing like having to multitask something when youve been up 12 hours and bitpay is making you google search how to use bitcoin in the most convoluted way possible.

I just spent 5 minutes searching trying to find this place that sells the watch dial with BTC printed on it before I got with the program. FFS. those smart watches are not bad on realism I suppose. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:42:13
Well I still think they are pretty neat, I mean I remember when having a color screen in your pocket/on you seemed like FUTURE tech, so these smart watches still amaze me.

Wasnt trying to be harsh, just being honest. I think needing funds and not having them is by definition mismanagement. Not passing judgement, I have been in that situation in the past and have accommodated my routines/preparations/arrangements to make sure it doesnt happen anymore, therefor I am not in need of any company such as bitpay providing me with any card/controlling any of my funds. Apologies if it came off as harsh, I think we have all been in that situation. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:15:02
Oh, yea I always use real watches. I have my phone in airplane mode 90% of the time anyway, so I dont really need yet another device blasting me with radio waves and also sending backdoor data collection to manufacturers. I do like the idea of a watch with a computer on it though, I'd just prefer it only have connection to other devices/internet via wire. 
also that hublot is crazy lol, never thought hublot would do something like that. and yes far too expensive, but cool nonetheless.

Back when you could get the address hacking the URL, I wasn't thrilled, but I at least still was able to buy from merchants/sites I wanted to. I saw bitpay as a necessary evil for normie customers/business owner to enter the crypto world.
Now that bitpay has alienated the core bitcoin users who value maintaining a tight secure processes (most times just being able to use their damn HW wallet) I see it as a cancer. I feel bad for the businesses who dont exactly know how this is losing them business because they arent  technically savvy/blockchain savvy, but I assume they will wise up once their numbers starts dropping. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 09:19:34
That sounds like speculation, and I value your speculation, but I dont think there is any merit in guessing how bitcoin would have preserved in commerce without the existence of bitpay. All I see now is a company losing profit from my purchase because of bitpay

Yea I am not sure about the best way to do it with shopify, I was (ass(u)(me)ing that you had your own site, bad assumption. Either way, the fact that you have your own node is impressive and if you can do that I have no doubt you at least are one of the merchants out there that respects the idea of bitcoin. Good luck figuring it all out for other coins as well, im sure you will somehow.
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:51:35
gotcha. yea, bit hard to defend shitpay.

There is no punishment in business, there is only supply/demand and risk/reward.

I have been using btc off and on for years, followed every contentious fork in the road closely, and from my point of view bitcoin is being preyed upon at every angle by companies like bitpay in order to profit off of dismantling its core purpose and redirecting that power unto themselves. makes me sick. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 09:17:24
Agreed with this ^ .. even if it stayed 100% safe to use forever. I see no reason to have to use some 3rd party solution just to use an already inefficient and insecure system such as bitpay, rather look elsewhere for vendors with proper payment platforms. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:48:49
I really dont care about what bitpay chooses to do or what shiny bow they put on their service to sell to old codgers running their businesses, I care that they are trying to centralize to the point of making addresses blocked from viewing even to the buyer. But what I care about means little, they can do what they want, and I will do the same by choosing to purchase from a better informed merchant.

I have no experience with coinbase commerce. In my opinion, if you are a vendor and wanting to accept bitcoin, you should learn how to manage your own wallet and learn the basic on storing/transfering/guarding your bitcoin. Its not as difficult as it seems, and there are many trusted solutions for automated vendor based payment platforms for crypto. It just takes a bit of research, but I think you will find it fascinating once you learn the ins and outs of bitcoin and gain a new respect for its existence. just my opinion.
