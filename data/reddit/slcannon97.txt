How can you claim to be from the future but made a post 68 days ago about whether selling BCH was a good idea? Wouldn't you already know

Daytrading makes better profits than HODLing. I don't know why you are lying in your post, sure it doesn't help BTC price go up steady daily but it's the reason for a lot of people who have entered the space and therefore still has significantly increased the price on the larger scale

Post should be in r/cryptocurrency  GPUs are used for mining eth, zec, etc., ASIC miners are used for bitcoin. Sad gamespot can't do enough research before letting out an article

This ^ as well as stop loss and stop buy orders. Learn the tools of GDAX and stick to the coins on there before moving to an exchange

Never had a problem, usually if someone has an issue it's their own fault

I always consult the actual market analysis with a group of friends instead of Reddit. We predicted it going as low as 9k as people were realizing gains and others were having weak hands. Next stop to 13-14k then probably another short bear before going bull again

Nope, there's just two types of people. People who hold the whole way up making 100% gains, and people who ride the waves making 1000% gains. The only problem is when one tries to be the other thy usually lose a lot of money

While this is true, I and many others don't believe so. I believe it's just Day traders taking out their profits. Nonetheless we will see the outcome over the next week. My fiat is on a bullish market
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:47:01
I sure hope not, otherwise we just missed out on the deal of a century

I don't see why the bubble will pop once and for all. Right now bitcoin has so much volatility that the big traders can't help from putting money in and taking profits from the small traders. With a system like that, and the people with the money profiting more and more, it is unrealistic to expect this to end anytime soon. The only way this would change is if there was a better "game" for the big investors to "play"
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:58:52
True, just want to make sure the new btc enthusiasts aren't missing out on a great time to get in the market
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:14:30
Or day traders will just take their 10-50% profit before putting it back in at a lower price... aka a correction 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:46:43
This happened when bitcoin started dropping from 20k and the panic sells initiated. While in that instance they blocked people from selling "due to volume" whose to say it couldn't happen? They keep around 90% in cold storage so theoretically they would go through a strain of fulfilling transactions causing them to temporarily disable transactions

"The resort will accept bitcoin cash" 
Fine, I'll take my bitcoin somewhere else, you have fun with your phony forked currency!
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:13:40
I would beg to differ
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:44:07
Sell BTC to USD, use USD to buy games. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:49:09
You have to remember some people are day trading. That being said, there's usually 5-15% volatility every $1,000 bitcoin gains because people are taking out profits.

I hope you know whales aren't the only ones selling. The reason for dips is Day trader realizing their profits and then buying back at a lower price
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:12:53

Card transfers are instant, but have a higher fee. ACH (normal bank account) transfers take longer but have a lesser fee.

Your name is very ironic considering what you just posted.
Search "how to use ______ bitcoin wallet" on YouTube. Coinbase is easy for beginners, after you get the gist start using GDAX to transfer. You will soon learn more and more as you continue to invest

You should look up travelers on Netflix. Great show, if you watch it you'll get my reference

If you're just trading btc/usd pair you can use gdax because it's really easy to set stop loss orders. The more experienced traders will trade on binance, kucoin, HitBTC, etc., and watch a few different coins. They will trade between these pairs from one that's up, to one that's on a dip. If you're new I'd start with gdax because it's easier to monitor btc/usd
