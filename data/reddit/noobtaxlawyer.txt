Very likely ATO will find that BTC is a foreign currency.
This would mean there is a CGT event every time you make a transaction with BTC - assuming the market value for a BTC is worth more at the point of the transaction than when purchased. There is a capital loss to record if lower.
Quite unhelpful for business's documentation requirements.
Unless you are in the business of providing forex I would not be concerned with GST. Foreign exchange transactions are considered input taxed transactions and hence there is no GST payable or thus claimable.

Generally it is going to be a CGT Event when you 'dispose' of your bitcoin - just like every other Forex. 
So when you make a transaction and use your Bitcoin to buy Goods/Services/Australian Dollars you will have a Capital Gain.
See Division 775 of the [ITAA 1997]( for more infomation or to make up your own mind.
Depending on your circumstances TOFA rules may apply to you as well.

Sorry Im still at work - on hold to the ATO for a client...
If you bought your BTC and then dispose of them the CGT regime will apply to you. Special Division 775 rules will also apply as it is a 'foreign currency' by definition - that it is a currency that is not the Austrailan Currency.
If you have been paid your salary/interest/rent in BTC the income tax/PAYG rules will also apply.
Under my interpretation of the law as it currently stands BTC would very likely fall within its scope. 
In regards to the ATO as far as I am aware has not made a particular statement in regards to BTC, other than that they are confident they will be able to apply the tax laws to those taxpayers making gains.
