If the BTC is showing in your account, the transfers you see on the chain are totally unrelated to your account. Blockchain.info does not keep your BTC in the address you sent to, they just add it to your balance and you can spend it at will from their interface. After it is credited to your account, they move the funds to other wallets, even cold wallets offline....they do not keep the BTC on the address you sent it to.
As long as you see the amount in your account you're OK.

Why do you think banks stopped FUDding Bitcoin and joined the movement? 
They suddenly saw where the *real* bubble was. The FED, China and ECB racing to print money to inflate the stock markets simply had to explode at some point.

Quantitative easing is almost exactly like tether. Only difference being tether might actually have more reserves than QE money which is money pulled out of thin air to pump the stock markets.
In fact the concept of Tether is based on central banking.
