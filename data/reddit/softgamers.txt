They are business. Once business is shut down. They close your personal too. 2 Business accounts and 1 Personal in Barclays and 2 Business and 1 Personal in Santander. I always did business with my company accounts.

Problem with Fidor is they can't offer Faster Payments. I'm a Fidor user but it doesnt help because buyers want their BTC the moment they pay.

Received a 2 months notice from Barclays. All the bitcoin traders based in UK we are losing our accounts faster than we can open them.

Fidor (DE) and Fidor (UK) are 2 different systems.

First of all congrats on the 4M :)
1) Open a bussiness in Dubai. It costs around 4k and you need to fly for one day to open an account. Process takes 2 weeks.
2) I'm a Bitcoin Broker and there are plenty of us. We can send money oversees for your Bitcoin. Make a few invoices for services.
3) Enjoy your 4M without paying any taxes.
Enjoy :)

Never come across?
Lloyds 1000 pound limit for first hour. Max 50k via FPS otherwise you need to walk in branch for BACS and get a hefty charge.
Barclays 2500 limit per day via mobile. 50k-100k online FPS and then BACS.
Santander 100k limit after that BACS.
Natwest 20k per day after that BACS
METRO 10-21k depends on your account after that you need to give them a call for verification.

If you are on the verge of homelessness you are doing something wrong mate. My advice is don't sell and forget about the coins not because I believe in the HODL (which I do) but because if you sell it, it will make you feel like everything its alright and then after a month or two you will be in the same position but only this time without bitcoin. Act now.

If you want good old days. Go get Bitch Cash. There was a split for a reason. Let us worry about the fees, which in reality aren't even that high. I pay cents not even a dollar most of the time.

No need to tell them you are a Bitcoin ATM business. Just say you have a Vending Machine chain.
Deposit Cash. Send to Coinbase or an other exchange. If bank asks why you use bitcoin say it's cheaper this way to buy from supplier. I'm not familiar with US or State laws. Make sure you don't need a MSB license and if you do then just get one.

That's nothing to do with EU laws. WaveCrest the BIN Sponsor of Xapo as well as countless others have license to Issue Visa/Mastercard only in the EU/EEA zone. Therefore they are not allowed to have users who are not residents in any of these countries.

you were right, refreshed a couple of times and managed to withdraw

Bitcoin Trader on LBC here. So you tell me ID theft is easy but buying a bank account online its not? How do I know you are the owner of the user that sends me the money? I've been a victim of chargeback. Wanna give me a better way to verify a user without asking for ID and selfie? 
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:14:46
Tier 4 Account... Still can't withdraw. It says i need to increase my limits xD... To what???
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:47:07
Lot's of reasons. First on they need to follow compliance of the bank they hold accounts with. Also Anti Money Laundering laws, sanctioned countries, blacklisted people. An exchange is a financial institution.

I'm a LBC trader. If you want me I can buy it from you and I can send you a transfer via Transferwise.
