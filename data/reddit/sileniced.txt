People can hold multiple coins, thus belonging to multiple groups.
And you know what, I'm going to argue in a different direction with you now. Bad things happen in society. An us vs them mentality isn't new. But the worth of the coins who represents the ideas will most likely be the best argument.
If a certain group that is backed with a coin shows off hostility. People who don't want to be associated with that hostility will sell their coin and back off. Lowering the price of that certain coin.

Thanks for the feedback, I can  appreciate that. So we need a spotify-like exchange that exchanges music driven coin. A re-think for exchanges is needed.
So an exchange that could handle a million different coins sounds and looks impossible, but when solved could help millions of people.
But for now, we should focus on developing a coin with a .txt file that says "hello world"..

Why not solve this problem by reducing the information to just "artist" and "title" on the blockchain and combining multiple blockchains. For computational resources, I see that computational resources are growing exponentially. So I see this becoming possible late 2014.

You're missing the whole point. What I want to be developed is a coin that contains information. With the same information in every whole coin.. 
Again... A re-think is needed not because of centralization (although I did mention it, but that is for another discussion) but because a spotify-like exchange. An exchange that trades coins that contains music. And there are a million songs. So there will be a million different coins

I do have strong arguments that we should steer away from using a single coin. Just imagine a time in the future where Bitcoins is a accepted means of payment globally. Soon you will see that maybe the top 1% controls half of the bitcoins.
What can we do about this gap? Use another cryptocurrency. Repeat this over and over and we're suddenly using multiple coins. Not because we want to... But because we don't have any choice.

What if I had a social media fanbase. They're already used to commenting anyway. Isn't this more convenient for social media users.
They might have to jump through some hoops though. Drawing them in with something like 50% discount if you'll use ChangeTip. (production value of a Cardboard is very low anyway). It would take six steps for a Dutch consumer from "never heard of bitcoin" to "Owning a Google Cardboard with 50% off".
1 Create ChangeTip account
2 Link Facebook account
3 Copy ChangeTip BTC address
4 go to 
5 Buy bitcoin and paste ChangeTip address
6 Buy product on facebook through comments.

@_date: 2014-08-16 10:09:06

You mean the market price? Are you saying bitcoin is just a stock? 
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:42:57
It's an idea for a service to expose them to trading.
Sadly, we can't turn back time 1.5 years to invest. So trading in that situation seems more appealing.

@_date: 2014-01-15 17:40:51
So basicly linking a blockchain with a file-sharing service would just be a bad idea. Moving forward.
That brings me back to my original question. How can we make a finite amount of a particular song?
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:52:22
Dozens of new altcoins are being launched every day, worth nothing more then just an intrinsic value. I suggest adding creative value to it. Putting cryptocurrencies in the next level.
Later when people find out they can make their own altcoin for pump and dump reasons... An infinite amount of altcoins could be made, devaluing cryptocurrencies as a whole. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:16:40
OK cool... So it sounds to me like you've made pro's and con's from a developer perspective. Please share this with me
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:11:07
Do you think that in the future, bitcoin has a way to overcome that through programming?
@_date: 2014-08-16 07:02:18
That is really far fetched. Can you proof your claims? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:48:59
It's just really lazy journalism. Seriously, I don't even expect from them anymore that they work hard, let alone just work.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:01:36
First of all... I've never coined the term DRM in this thread. I hate DRM, it's useless and it doesn't work like it is supposed to work.
I understand that the closest to this technological reality is to pair the blockchain with a filesharing service. Try to think outside the box how this could be possible, without using a filesharing service. Remember that Bitcoins was considered to be impossible too at first, double spending and such.
NO this is NOT donation based, I never said it would be donation based (of course they could donate if the consumer bought the song at a low price and want to donate more to the artist). The music they put inside a coins is based on the supply and demand of the finite amount of that particular song.
I need to attract artist who depends on getting paid with their creative work - small, beginning or big, donation is too much of a liability.
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:04:03
The internet has ruined the thumbnail.

@_date: 2014-08-16 11:49:03


In microeconomics, it's already impossible to pay of all the debts for the loans that it has made, because there is more interests than the initial currency. A global monetary collapse is imminent, with or without the use of digital currency.
So yes, I could hypothesize that digital currency is a way to bury and forget current debts.


The general way of converting someone is to allow them to enter a different world, if it already exists or just in their imagination. Any answer that contains fiat in the first place could make then sceptic of change.
So yes, for the sake of being persuasive, fiat is dumped.
Edit: But if there is any way you think you could persuade them without these conditions, be my guest.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:15:15
Thank you for your feedback. Stating the price is a great idea. Also, a green screen increases production value.

Edit: I'm glad that you find my idea valuable. 
There might be a limited amount of a certain coin. But keep in mind that there is already a unlimited amount of cryptocurrencies. So think about.
I fail to find the correct words to describe that the coins whose total market capital is even worth a slight gram of gold. Is at least worth something,  but could mean a million for the people it represents and their values.

I see. Government deficit spending has always been a double edged sword. It funded both large social projects and wars. And to strip away the government ability to deficit spend to fund large projects sounds like a big speed bump in political development to me. 
However it's a fact that - in fiat currency - we can't pay the interest rate on the federal reserve banking. So bitcoin is the government's solution to bury any debts. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:53:54
Would you consider to take trading DOGE a step further. Add a goal and purposely increase the volatility. Make it more fun.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:36:43
Yes, exposing people to speculative trading. I will use that from now on.
The difference between cryptocurrencies and stock market is the amount of capital needed. Crypto exchanges widens the target audience. because you can also trade with 5 dollars worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:42:25

So basically, we need to change from quantity currency to quality currency. For the video, if you change his words from bitcoins to gold and silver it would offer the same function. 
Now as I stated before, government deficit spending has always been a double edged sword. It functions to fund public works, social projects and wars. And to strip away the government ability to deficit spend to fund large projects sounds like a big speed bump in political development to me.
Now how could the government still be able to fund these projects without using fiat or raise taxes?

It's the shops who accept certain coin who makes the difference, maybe (you make me think. Your feedback is truly valuable to me) . And even if you're an creationist, that doesn't automatically imply that they won't accept coin from an evolutionist, maybe the beautiful part of it, is that you can find common ground if you both use, for example, organic-foodcoin. 
It really makes certain differences between people more transparent, but similarities between them as well. 
Edit: I forgot to reply to who would accept personal coins... Yeah family sure. If that certain individual is really making an effort to create value in his coin, but then it would probably be a commodity...? I don't know yet, interesting.
But I shouldn't be bothered by such details. If I could at least convince a certain group of people to use in their particular coin. That is just one step... 
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:12:38

But think about how my vision could be applied to you? I don't hope that you have extremist and destructive ideas. If the 'vegancoin' could get any significant value. It might be a better idea to grow a community who produces homemade organic vegetables.  And then everybody could trade with vegancoin as currency.
I like how you're passionate about the vegan lifestyle. I'm not vegan myself don't get me wrong. But passion is what could fuel the cultural capitalism.

you guys are really circlejerky. I support anything that progresses the way consumers *think* about payments. This is most definitely a bridge between the two worlds. Even if visa is digging its own grave, its newer options are innovative for the general public.

But then how is bitcoin able to fund anything that is large scale like infrastructure?

Could you please elaborate on the colored coins?

And to see that e-mail was revolutionary for some at the time. It has grown out to something like facebook, youtube, wikipedia, any other website. Just imagine if you combine all those innovation and progress, and add the idea of money to it.

It's nothing like paypal. Even if you were doing a sales pitch, you'd confirmed the wrong perspective of bitcoin, don't pitch on privacy, except if they're silk road users, which the majority is not.
"PayPal does the same thing in its essence. The difference is, is that PayPal is a company. Bitcoin - like email - isn't a company because it's simply the way computers communicate with each other.'

It's still a broken public school but they call themselves an elite private school. And it's only an elite private school if all the students choose to opt in to "not be broken". But most broken students don't even know how to "not be broken" they're from a broken family, have broken history.
The "elite private school" doesn't even realize that all of its students are "broken public school" material.

You're choice of emotional appeal is anger. While there is nothing wrong with that on a marketable level. It may be quite immoral. I mean haven't you seen Star Wars at all. Anger is what brought Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.

Money is just the first application of bitcoin. Just like mail was for the internet, now look at what the internet has grown into.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:17:06
The Bitcoin Idea is still a toddler at best. There are a lot of phases of R&amp;D in an disruptive idea of that magnitude.
instead of focusing on the price of bitcoin, instead keep an eye on bitcoin start-ups instead, something that has big innovative potential, which is subjective of course.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:03:32
Just because they're unhappy doesn't immediately imply that they:
1. keep wanting to pursue selling on any platform.
2. willing or able to learn anything new
3. open to the idea of digital money without compromising their innocence. 
Being unhappy with the service of a competitor is a good idea for a market, but don't base your whole target market solely on that idea.
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:06:08
This is a good point. Schrodinger's cat applies here. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:38:06
Allow me to reword your question:
Imagine us living in 1989: Do you see internet in the future as:
A) a scaling peer to peer network with ultra cheap emails, for anyone globally to use, with the internet functioning as network mail, avoiding postal services.
B) a communication layer for companies and early adopters, with a low network usage to transact upon other computers.
BOTH! AND WAY WAY MORE!
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:51:30
The thing is... Bitcoin has a name associated with drugs, hitmen, silk road, Mt. Gox, ponzi's, pyramids, you name it. So that isn't a very salable idea.
Blockchain is a way to rebrand Bitcoin. But by rebranding the technology, half of it has the potential to be forgotten. Which is the money part.
Now, a blockchain without the decentralized money part is just a slow database (as far as I know). Those financially invested in those "blockchain only" companies will find out sooner or later that it's potential is very limited.
So my guess is that this blockchain investment bubble will burst sooner or later and innovation lies back in the hands of those who DO see the potential in blockchain WITH decentralized money attached to it.

It's really how you look at it. I think jonstern's pov is that bitcoin should disrupt and replace current payments systems. And jeanduluoz imagined bitcoin sitting next to the other payments systems. Maybe jon is looking 20 years further in time and jean 20 months.
Consciousnesses are hard.

I'm sorry but I don't think that it's simple enough. This just add to the fragmentation of what the general public knows about bitcoins. Still going to share it though.

Wooow. I've been looking at your Reddit past. I'm kinda worried, are you okay? Can I be of any assistance?

Just curious if you're aware of any developments in the alt-coin markets? Smart contracts? Decentralized Autonomous Organizations? Anything of the matter.
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:53:57
If it ever would happen. I think that the media will cover it, which hinders adoption significantly. Which would be hard to recover from.
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:59:30
or ELI4: you have a dentist appointment in two weeks. It's a regular check-up appointment and it's not mandatory. Your dentist placed a smart contract with the following function: "if 1 bitcoin is deposited 1 week before the appointment, an appointment will be made, if not this appointment will be skipped and postponed 1 month later."
Well a working calendar app must exist in the bitcoin network first for this to work.

OR 90% of all dollars went suddenly missing. It's an absurd example, but it is in the realm of something going terribly wrong..

Only way to classify as a good cause if the bitcoin went directly to someone in need. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:17:37
In the moderators defense, it takes time (and guts) to explain something that disruptive. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:11:47
This makes a lot of sense though. And to be frank, Buttcoin once hurt my feelings, so I can't deny that I go to to let my ego go into destroy mode. Soooo does that make me a good guy or a baddie?

It's a bit too aggressive to red flag them for not supporting multisig. If we lived in a time where multisig is a standard in e-commerce, then yeah, red flag all you want. But we're way too early to do that in this early early stage of bitcoin.
I don't even know how a multisig escrow works.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:08:50
He's exactly talking about this sort of denial... Close minded shit that positions every factual evidence about other coins as "pumping a shitcoin". THIS is what unopened eyes looks like. THIS is what sheeple looks like who are unable to open its eyes. I wish you all the luck.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:12:04
If everything concludes to "pumping a shitcoin" then it is an deductive approach of your view of reality... A deductive POV is a very narrow one.
