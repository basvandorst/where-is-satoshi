Yeah, check out those comments for a good idea of what the average person thinks of Bitcoin.

What a fascinating and well-written comment. I can't say that I've got any allegiance with this type of thinking. But I'd love to hear more about this ideological thinking of yours. It's clear you're quite comfortable operating within this decentralised environment and you've probably thought well and hard about the implications of autonomous actors gaming the system to their own ends. Curious to hear your ethical reasoning of this strategy - that is, if you want to?

Out of curiosity, how does an ATM sale work? What sort of fees are we talking? Can I just walk up to a Bitcoin ATM for example and sell a single Bitcoin? It's not like I'll receive $1000+ in cash there and then right? Is it a bank transfer?

Statements like this simply don't have any weight. There is just no way to foresee how crypto will fare during economic uncertainty. Whilst crypto may hold its own, it's also entirely possible that crypto assets tank to record lows in the event of economic uncertainty. Claims that it is a relative "safe haven" are simply unfounded and speculative at best.

I would speculate that it crashes. We know that most people use bitcoin as an investment project, rather than a means to facilitate currency transactions. So that should be pretty telling in itself. With mass job losses, many people will be required to pull their money from such speculative investments. However, this is uncharted territory and so I may be overlooking some aspects to this.

Thanks dude! Much appreciated! 
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:02:44
I shall move my coin right away! Thanks man. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:56:03
Ah, do you suggest I move my cash from blockchain? What things have ruined the reputation? 
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:39:54
I've moved my coin and my tip : ) into Breadwallet. With breadwallet I have access to a recovery phrase and thats it. Is this my only hard access I have to my own wallet? The recovery phrase I now physically have? Sorry for the noob questions but I was able to back up my previous wallet in blockchain via downloading a file and storing it offline. Breadwallet doesn't seem to have anything I can see to store.

Thank you kind stranger : )

It's been something I've scanned over on Reddit for a few years now, just keeping my ears close to the ground. Never something that I wanted to personally put my own money into (certainly after stories like the MTGOX hack) also sometimes when I had the money, and thought about investing, it never seemed easy enough to do. So much information that went over my head. Time went by, and Bitcoin continued to get discussed. Richard Branson articles come to mind. My lack of faith in the current financial system fuelled my interest further, so much so that I decided to spend a bit of time researching wallets, and general Bitcoin concepts on this subreddit. And lastly, the idea of getting behind something before it explodes, almost like the early days of the Internet excites me. Perhaps nothing will happen, and this will pass. And my loss of a Bitcoin won't change my life in the slightest. But perhaps we'll ride this into vast riches in the distant future, with a single Bitcoin worth a large amount.  
@_date: 2015-10-14 10:12:14
May I ask why you would move coins from these platforms the moment your amount exceeds 3 Bitcoin? What makes bread wallet vulnerable with a larger amount? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:33:00
Do both. You've said your piece. Now back it up.
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:44:38
Yeah, you're right. Kinda silly really that the magical number of 1 was a requirement in my mind. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:03:06
I can't possible tell you what to do. Why? Because the numbers may climb another $600 this week and you'll be kicking yourself for listening to a random on the internet for jumping ship now.
Emotion from this subreddit will never tell the true tale of what is happening. There's too many people here who are acting on their own interests to get an objective position. I can only implore you to read the data and speculate on the upcoming situation that is engulfed in uncertainty. Humans don't do uncertainty very well. We tremble and sell. As August 1st approaches, do you feel that's the a moment that welcomes investment? A moment that encourages people to purchase the currency at it's highest ever rate? I say no. I will wait. You can join me at your pleasure, but I invite no man to stand beside me.

The bubble is soon to pop... Any smart investor is aware of this, huge drop in transactions which are most certainly an indication of fee manipulation - glorious media attention, rapid growth with a huge obstacle on the immedite horizon (August 1st) is very telling of this situation. People are getting rich before the moment of uncertainy approaches. Enjoy it while it lasts, I'm in the bitcoin game for life - I believe in this tech, but I'm not a fool who is blind to this current predicament. Stand by gents.
