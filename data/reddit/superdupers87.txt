Been HODLin BTC since 2012. Sold BCH @ 1500 something USD. I only HODL one alt (ADA) since 2017, which I bought with forks. I plan to stake ADA and earn passive income.

Yes not your key not your coins. 
If you plan to hold your bitcoin long term I wouldn’t recommend you using a third party, Storing bitcoin at a third party like crypto.com, blockchain.info etc means you don’t own your key..  If the site were hacked, shut down there’s nothing you can do to recover your funds. It would be lost.
For long term I would strongly suggest you buying a hardwallet for safe storage for example Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Its a hardwallet where you own your key. That would be the key to the vault. The main feature of bitcoin.. you are in total control of your funds.
If your for example lose your hardwallet you can simply recover your funds at anytime by simply using ur key(seed).

Welcome to the relaxed hodlers club! I feel the same and I have been invested since 2012. 
I think the most common reason people panic when bitcoin drops is because the simple lack of knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrencys. They are just invested to become millionaires and went on the hype train. And they digest a lot of fud.
I’d suggest the ones with weak hands - read and learn and then you’ll find out how revolutionary this is. Once you get it you just can’t get enough and you will view the “crashes” as a great discount to accumulate the coin.
