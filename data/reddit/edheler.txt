Moderators can see monthly unique visitors and pageview data and charts that go back one year. All of the other data sources only go back two months. (I am a moderator of a sub with ~4k users.)

I have a few computers that run 24/7 so it isn't a big deal to have them doing something. It probably costs me more in electricity than the bitcoins are worth at the moment but I figure that will change if I don't spend them.
I looked into trying to acquire something like 0.25 BTC via an exchange but ended up learning quite a bit about why it is difficult. It is unfortunate that there isn't a less expensive and easier way to turn cash or credit into BTC.

Aha! I can understand initial account setup taking a while. I thought they were referring to transactions after all of that was setup. Thanks!
