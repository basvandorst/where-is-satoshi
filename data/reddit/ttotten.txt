I have 5 days on the over/under before eBay pounds you over the head.  I used to run a business that was 100% eBay.  Now it's 100% not eBay.

Lots of great bitcoin activity in Finland these days!  Really enjoyed my time there as a tourist last summer.  Got to drop in on LocalBitcoins, checked out several bitcoin ATMs around Helsinki (think it was 9 in total at the time!), even bought a few meals and tourist stuff with bitcoins.  Keep up the good work there!

Awesome work!  How do you advertise/promote these meet ups?  I want to get in that loop so I can join next time I'm in town! 
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:21:07
Thank you for thoughtfully expressing the same thing that comes to my mind every time I hear un-backed claims of manipulation.
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:59:48
Great.  Total math fail.  If you didn't pass 6th grade, you probably shouldn't be trying to run a business where the difference between milli and micro will make or break you.  It certainly doesn't give confidence to potential customers.

Great news!  Definitely going there next time I'm back in my adopted home.
Curious if you have any experience yet with buybitcoin.ph.  Getting ready to try it out with a few small transactions, and hoping for the best.

Hey, I've eaten at this place a couple times and it's great!  Definitely stopping in next time I'm in town.

This is great news, actually.  Nothing becomes widely relevant in our society without lobbyists coming out on all sides.  If the established financial industry didn't feel threatened enough by Bitcoin to start lobbying, I'd be concerned.  The fact that we're getting their attention tells me we're on the right track.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:36:54
Awesome!  I just send a request to join.  Hope I'm accepted.  :-)

I've used several different bitcoin ATMs around the world, and frankly, this one was the least intuitive, not to mention the costs.  I also tried the two similar models at the Helsinki central train station, and neither of them was even working (as of last week).

C'mon man.  There's nothing like a bait-and-switch going on here.  It's an invitation process for soft-launching a new service.  Pretty standard stuff, just like most of the major services Google has rolled out in recent years.  Except with this one, they are giving you a FREE 10 USD worth of BTC.  If this is the worst thing you can think of to complain about, then you must live in a much better country than I do.

See buybitcoin.ph.  They just started operations.  Haven't tried them yet, but plan to soon.

Maraming salamat po.  Nice work.  Just sent a small contribution myself.  Keep up with good work there in my second home!  I'm looking forward to spending all my bitcoins in the Philippines once I retire there in a few years.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:54:10
I used the ATM at Kynsilaukka the other day.  Pretty nice.  Definitely helps to have a localbitcoins account already set up.  I also ate at the restaurant, and paid for my meal with bitcoins.  Great food, especially if you like garlic!

Wow.   just tweeted me a slice of pizza.  This just makes me happy on so many levels!

In Vegas, you just have to get in the ring and basically do nothing for a few rounds, then collect your big payout.  In the blockchain, you just have to get in and hodl for a few years, then collect your big payout.  At least that's my plan.  :-)

I can't wait to get back to my second home there in the Philippines so I can pay you guys a visit.  You're doing such exciting things!  Unfortunately, it probably won't be until sometime after Christmas.  In the meantime, we're cheering you on from the other side of the planet!  When SCI becomes the Google of the Philippines, I can tell everyone I knew you guys back in the day . . .

Just a small point of clarification--TDA allows trading of GBTC in a "regular" account, but if some portion of your 401(k) is traded through a self-directed account on TDA, you might be under restrictions that prevent trading of GBTC.  In my case, I can't trade any OTC stocks in my self-directed 401(k) account through TDA.  I assume that's a limitation put in place by employer.  But no issues trading GBTC on my "regular" (fully taxable) TDA account.

I suspect you'll beat me to it, since it's probably at least 2-3 more months before I can get back to Makati.  And by the way, it looks like the minimum transaction is only 1000 PHP for buying BTC.  Still a big number for some Filipinos, but within reach of many.  Maraming salamat po!
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:40:48
Good question.  I could guess, but sorry I don't have a definitive answer.

Brilliant idea.  Why didn't I think of that?!  Here's $0.50.  @_date: 2015-05-12 22:12:14
I like it!  I'm involved with two charitable organizations that accept bitcoin donations, and we couldn't receive contributions in bitcoin if there weren't enough full nodes in operation.  So in my mind, it's not a leap to claim that operating full nodes is a charitable activity by extension.  Of course, the IRS might not share my view.  :-)

Too many people seem to be conflating a) a report that Coinbase generates only for its customers with b) something like a 1099 that Coinbase might some day be required to report to the IRS.
It turns out a) is basically completely useless for any normal user (that is, anyone who uses any bitcoin wallet other than Coinbase). Whatever. Lots of companies generate useless reports for their customers. Who cares? I never look at that report, and there is little reason for anyone else to look at it. Move on with your life and save your bullets for bigger battles.
More importantly, there is no requirement (yet) for b). When/if that day comes, we can all come back and debate what kind of data should be on a "bitcoin 1099" and how it should be reported. Even that might be irrelevant if the IRS/DoJ win their court battle to serve a John Doe Summons on any bitcoin company of their choosing.

As I understand it, the (federal) U.S. Patriot Act makes it an offense to operate a money transmitting business without the appropriate (state-level) approval.  So if a U.S. state defines a certain type of bitcoin transaction as money transmission requiring a state license, and you violate that state regulation, you are simultaneously violating federal law.  It's depressing and frustrating on so many levels, but I think that's the sad reality we are living under.  And by "we," I don't mean just U.S. citizens.  :-(

I'm an American, but the Philippines--and the Filipino people--have captured my heart.  Let me add Baguio, Batangas, Puerto Galera, Tagaytay and Bohol to the list, just to name a few other destinations you really need to visit.  Can't wait until the day I can retire in the Philippines and spend my bitcoin nest egg.  Thanks to and the gang at SCI for building that bright future.  :-)

+1 on the podcast audio!  So many bitcoin podcasts are just unintelligible at times, or there is a 50 dB difference in levels between the hosts, the guests and the weird bumpers.

My suspicion is that some of these bogus listings get into coinmap (and airBitz and others?) because someone incorrectly changes the "accepts bitcoin" flag on a restaurant's Yelp listing.  We had a local restaurant pop up recently on both coinmap and airBitz, apparently because of this.  I ended up having one of those "what is bitcoin?" discussions with the waitress, the shift manager and eventually the owner/GM.  I got the Yelp listing updated, updated the "payment:bitcoin" status on OpenStreetMap (which fixed coinmap), and submitted a removal request to airBitz.  Still, it would be nice if some Yelp user's screwup didn't result in stories like these.

So, what's the over/under on the huge $GBTC 2% fee once $COIN goes live?  I mean TWO PERCENT sounds like a fee set by someone with a background in credit cards.

Ironically, the advertisement I got served up before I could watch this video was for . . . wait for it . . . AIG.  They might as well have said "this video about Bitcoin is brought to you by the following 'too-big-to-fail' organization . . ."
