Not sure what you are seeing tbh

Price peg to more than one commodity is unsustainable is it implies that the relative value between i.e. bread and oil should remain constant. That would just open it up for arbitrage.
What would be required for a bitcoin peg would be a sufficient enough number of countries to stabilize the peg, with no pegs on commodities as they should move w supply and demand.

Because of transaction times, fees and interest rates earned on local currency higher than 0 on btc. Nobody used gold under the gold standard for the same reasons

And they would go bankcrupt given selling oil at a loss?

They can still refuse to pay you lol

People arent spending bitcoins with merchants though

Dude if bitcoin isnt considered good enough for online transactions by cryptoredditors, then even lightning won't be enough  to attract normies. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:11:01
Why man... wallets
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:45:38
Certainly

Now thats assuming a continued exponential trend is it not? To achieve continued exponential growth from here will be very hard.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:43:38
Is this for real?
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:17:48
Those are neither decentralized or immutable though are they?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:08:55
Did you pay in Bitcoin or not in the end?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:39:58
Doubt lightning will be considered safe enough for merchants tbh

Last time it was at 6k it spiked to 9k. TA cant predict bitcoin movements my friend

Smart contracts on a decentralized platform is the worst possible idea. One rouge code element and billions could vanish. No company would ever do that

Dude every Bitcoin investor has been lucky with the bull run last 8 years as well. Buffet has weathered many crashes and crisis. Not that he is right on this though.

Makes sense. Funny how adaption hasn't even reached this subbreddit. How can it go global when redditors themselves can't be bothered to spend it
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:26:33
Why? There are no incentives to use btc for domestic purchases. Its expensive, slow and gives no fraud insurance. And ppl are holsing btw as an investment. Why would these factors ever change?
