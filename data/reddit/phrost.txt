Yeah, lets get Alex Jones and NAMBLA on this train too. Credibility be damned.

Do you have aspergers?
I ask because as someone who owns several forums, I too have banned people for posting excessive off-topic replies in a thread; especially when they feel they're above the rules.
Most of the time, the person gets the hint, and moves on.  The few that don't, usually have something misfiring in their heads.
Here's the thing: a forum is a community.  If that community doesn't want you there, why would you want to impose upon it?  It's a sign of severe social disfunction when you can't recognize when your presence in a group is unwanted.  This has nothing to do with freedom of speech, it's about you disrupting the discussions and refusing to take responsibility for your actions.

You could have just replied, "yeah, I've got aspergers".
...would have saved you some time.

I dunno, as a small business I'd be pretty upset if one of my customers was creating fake accounts to troll me, all things aside.

Another part of being a business is having the option of enthusiastically showing a particularly belligerent customer to the front exit.
I realize there's a lot of hate for BFL here, but the guy BFL's rep was responding to, was trolling via a sockpuppet; which is kinda like the online equivalent putting on a fake mustache and being an asshole to the staff and customers at a brick and mortar office.

BFL eating babies and stomping puppies.
