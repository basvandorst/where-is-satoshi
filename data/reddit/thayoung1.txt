Yeah, totally sucks right now with the high fees,  mempool and miners policy to not pick up these kind of transactions.
I did a transaction back on the 5th of December which still isn't confirmed. The default selected fee within the wallet did apply. Next to that I find a couple of cents enough for a transaction. Luckily the other party from which I bought something was ok without the confirmation and gave me the product I wanted to buy.
Just someone using Bitcoin as a payment thing. Not working for me at the moment.

Well, looks like that's not the case. Transaction still pending.

Yeah, but that would lead to a lot of centralization and isn't that what many Bitcoiners don't like? Personally I think the way Bitcoin Cash goes (bigger blocks) is a better solution for now, but hey, that's my personal meaning. 
Love to hear from others

One option is to create a paper wallet 
That way you control the private key

In the end we would go and use another currency because in the end all private keys would be lost

Last month. Transaction is still pending. Luckily the service which I was 'buying' accepted the pending transaction.
Hopefully there's a solution before the entire 'first mover' collapses.

Did they gave to pay him $10 in return for the transaction fee? ;)

You can also use the Wallet function of Blockchain.info. This wallet supports import of Bitcoin addresses (readonly without private key or spendable with private key). You can then transfer your coins to a Market Place if you want to sell (wouldnt recommend Coinbase at the moment because of price and stability). You could use Kraken or another Market Place of your choice

You mean something like  They make it simple for companies tot accept Bitcoin for payments and convert Bitcoin to $ on the time of the  transaction with a configured distribution key.
