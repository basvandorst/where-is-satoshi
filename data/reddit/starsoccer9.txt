No offense, but coinb.in is all javascript so they never have any of the keys. So its not withdrawing from coinb.in. Its transfering funds from whatever address they are on. Chances are you can use another service to recover your funds.
I have no idea what that error means, but it sounds like a transaction was already broadcasted that uses the funds.

I completely understand wanting to ship a good product and am very happy about that, I am just disappointed in the lack of communicate that has gone on. 
Developers who have a ledger blue and developed an software have had to wait longer then expected for consumer devices to come out.
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:45:30
Can you not read? It says synapse won't allow the deposit not kraken
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:33:47
really November now? Might be nice to maybe make a blog post or something about every delay rather then pretend there is no delay until asked. Not sure why all bitcoin companies seem to think its better PR to pretend there is no delay/issue and wait for it to just go away. Ledger started with shipping in June, then September, now back to November. Soon you will be back at June again. Your getting close to being as bad as butterflylabs(thats not a compliment).

If synapse steals your money, then its synapse who you would sue not kraken. Thats like saying you send your money to Bitpay and then bitpay refuses the process the order. You dont yell at the company you yell at bitpay because they wont process it.

So should I say scam or ponzi?
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:09:40
I am not sure how in any way this effects kraken. If synapse goes bankrupt or is hacked tomorrow and looses all your fund, sure kraken customers will be pissed, but its synapse who is at fault not kraken.
Just like in the Bitfinex hack, Bitfinex is to blame not bitgo.
@_date: 2016-04-17 12:31:46
Yes I am, feel free to send me a pm with any questions or concerns you have
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:22:00
You can use kraken If your in one of kraken's supported states
@_date: 2016-04-17 13:18:37
I would not use that site, it has no ratings what so ever and from every search I have done seems to be basically brand new
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:57:11
Public keys are used for creating a multi-signature address. If you put your bitcoin address in it, we will try to pull the public key from it, but this is not always possible to do. I would checkout this reddit thread about someone asking the same exact question, 
The instructions are for users who are not very technical and want to create a brand new address or reuse an address and only have access to the private key. While we could simply ask for the private key on site, sending users to another site where they can learn about public keys as well as about the cryptography in general, I thought was better. There are very few services or wallets in general that allow you to view your public key. In the future we may change this to link to an instructions page for each wallet. If you tell me what wallet you have I can attempt to walk you through the instructions.
If you already filled out the form, you basically have 2 options, one generate a new address and get use its public key(make sure you save the private key) or reuse an existing address that you have the private key from.
If you have any other questions, feel free to use our live chat or email support.

I didnt realize this has been a problem for over a year.  This is exactly why I posted. People need to be aware of this so they also dont get their funds in limbo.
There are vastly better exchanges to use instead of HitBTC. Honestly the only reason I used them for this recent transaction was they were the only exchange that supported the coin I had. I wont make that mistake again though.

GitHub please
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:41:44
another nice video, quite concerning that blackarrow does that, but then again their asics are more or less all broken, so they gotta make money somehow.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:41:59
not trying to mix/clean/wash coins, just dont want to have to go through the whole process on yet another site
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:09:19
I asked for a refund and they told me no
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:08:52
not at all it shows that the trezor has alot of bug/problems despite them claiming it doesnt.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:21:18
sadly no, your best place is bitcoin market subreddit or via bitcointalk. You could also try cryptothrift tho
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:17:19
Having personally had a trezor since launch, I can say I have had nothing but problems. I would recommend anything but the trezor.
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:48:58
I didn't say it was a good scam attempt.

As for reputation, I am obviously biased, but I think at this point we are the longest running service still in existence. BTCrow was around before us but they have since disappeared it seems
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:48:17
personally I would rather use a ledger wallet then a trezor wallet. I had assumed the trezor wallet would be good since it had a screen, was in development for quite a long time and was created by a large pool owner. I was horribly mistaken. I have had nothing but issues with my trezor, and none of the issues have been fixed, personally I feel they have gotten even worse.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:33:02
I am not sure, I am reporting it because I do not want other people to adjust the discount thinking they are going to get an item for less and have it somehow be more.
Yes I tried to contact purse, and as usual their contact does not seem to work.
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:02:10
As said before, basically everything possible. funds not sending, funds being spent twice, funds not showing up, and even accounts disappear
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:22:07
I did, they have just told me they are aware of the problem and have had me try many different things, but nothing has fixed it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:17:12
so basically if I plan to withdraw without giving you such info I should be withdrawing ASAP
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:20:19
I am not saying that I do, but when coinbase is the only company going above and beyond, doesnt really seem that they are just barely following it.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:46:09
shouldnt be too different, but I would get legal advice first. I am quite sure you would need a money transmitter license and have to register with fincen
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:13:31
there is a difference in following regulations and going above and beyond to comply with regulations. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:36:27
Yea wouldnt sell it that low. I mean while it is used, it is in basically brand new condition, not to mention it is a first edition trezor.
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:44:59
make an offer :)

Join the club of people screwed by coinbase
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:14:51
If you operate on a full reserve, then all user deposits should be protected by a 2 of 3 multisig with the user holding one key and a 3rd party holding another key. Any plans to do this?
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:23:55
I know that..... I mean the code to redirect users
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:01:09
Yes, there support leaves alot to be desired. I have had tickets wait 3+ days for a response
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:27:38
honestly dont get your hopes up coinbase is nothing but trouble and given enough time will break promises and probably try to close your account atleast 3 times
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:23:30
I have one and its caused me nothing but trouble. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:04:22
join the club, the trezor I have had nothing but issues. When I asked for a refund they said I am one of the few people with problems out of the thousands that have no issue, so it must be me.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:26:20
Seems to be working for me
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:01:16
Well I dont like that they use chrome either, I would much rather a dedicated program or atleast an addon for firefox.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:14:00
will KYC/AML be required for all withdrawals in the future?
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:25:27
Any eta?
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:18:08
The only reason I went to extremes was after I had noticed it was changing in the opposite direction. Basically It was set I think at like 30% off. I was going to adjust it to make 33% and I noticed the total price went up. Thats when I slide it all the way to 50% to see what would happen and then back to 5%
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:36:29
Personally Id advise against getting one. I have had nothing but issues with mine.
 As for alternatives, yes ledger is quite cheap to use, but you can also checkout the Case wallet tho it isnt out quite yet.
BTW, if you still want a trezor, I will gladly sell you mine, it is a day one edition trezor as well.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:49:03
Any plans to release the code your using on shapeshift.io? I would like to use it on my site
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:34:17
I have done that successfully, but I have run into all other issues.
Not being able to send more then one transaction a day, having it say my wallet is empty when it was not, having funds I spent already not showing as spent, and once having funds spent twice.
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:00:46
Well basically everything possible, funds disappear, funds reappearing, not being able to send funds, accounts/addresses not showing up
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:39:28
okay great, but who would this trusted 3rd party be?
@_date: 2015-06-26 01:33:58
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:18:29
Yes, I am not sure why, It must be a bug of some sort. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:12:22
well even if their website is comprised, as long as you dont just keep pressing yes on your trezor, it cant send funds to someone else
@_date: 2014-10-20 23:52:39
agreed, mainly I needed/wanted US support so I had to go with Bitreserve. If you add US support I would gladly use your service. Shoot me a PM and we can maybe talk further
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:06:20
I think you need to understand SEC only deals with securities and investment fraud unlike fincen.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:09:05
congrats, it was a good move, soon you will be able to mock the people who didnt.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:25:32
I am quite sure such a feature exists, you may want to look into 
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:01:10
Just to make you aware I contacted bitmit  multiple times prior to shutting down and after they shut down to which I got not one response.Right now the only decent site is cryptothrift. The problem with making an eBay but taking bitcoin is that there are alot of laws and regulations and it becomes quite expensive if you want to run one legally.
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:00:07
Yes that is true, but id rather rewrite my code now and work with a reliable exchnage/service then create a new coinbase account simply to have to deal with coinbase in the future.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:24:21
Not sure what is great about coinbase unless you mean them closing your account for stupid reasons
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:31:41
Great to get your reply here. You should consider doing a AMA
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:24:04
yes, exactly why this is a huge deal and why bitcointalk should really have atleast decent sercuity/turn around time. This is also why I like bitcoin-otc
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:38:33
Well all I know is bitreserve supports US customers no problem.
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:38:02
I found it was quick and easy to use
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:34:28
FYI bitvps accepts bitcoin for hosting, bitvps.com
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:56:37
currently you cant, but I am sure in the future someone will figure out a trustless way to do that.

Yes trucoin is legit and id highly recommend trying it

there used to be a windows phone bitcoin wallet but it sadly is gone. Someone really needs to make a good wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:59:12
The best option for a pool would be mmpool.org. They merge mine all the same coins as well as more. 
For cloud mining there are many options tho.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:03:26
sadly i dont have a personal site dedicated to my works. Tho I am thinking about making one. It would most likely be a good idea.
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:44:05
I think it is 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:22:53
where can we get this app?
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:23:25
I would love to help you with this.I have alot of trust on bitcoin-OTC, as well as bitcointalk
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:16:50
Well depending on the app you can probably recover your wallet and then use the bitcoins. If you need any help feel free to pm me and I will help the best I can 
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:54:22
why you want your account closed for sending to a possibly illegal litecoin address?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:40:01
Dont use coinbase. Plain and simple
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:40:14
well doesnt make much sense.
But for an exchange, I would say having all accounts as a multi-signature account in one of the following layouts
- with a 2 of 3 where the exchange holds one key, the user then 2 keys
- with a 2 of 3 where the exchange holds one key, the user holds one key, and a trusted 3rd party holds the last key.
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:08:57
haha, meant there. When I type quickly I seem to just pick a there at random
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:13:45
okay cool, let me know.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:04:35
for the record mmpool.org merge mines all the same coins and more, is smaller and rewards whoever gets the last share of the block the transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:18:02
For those of you wondering, I have still gotten no response and have reached out in every way I physically can. I looked and found more emails theymos uses, I had someone send him a message on bitcointalk and I have added him on skype.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:43:25
Oo yea no problem no hard feelings
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:14:36
YAYAYAY i got 1000 gold and you none lol
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:59:41
yea well it takes time.

Bitreserve does tho, if you shoot me a pm I can invite you. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:40:54
You need to step into the fool proof world and order some titanium wallets from

@_date: 2014-07-29 14:31:46
That is really cool. You should make it into a website or just a simple program that the user runs. I would use it.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:50:01
Yea I wouldn't be using a sight where I have to link with facebook

@_date: 2014-11-14 09:38:45
Yea I am a shill for trucoin but post about my own bitcoin escrow service
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:34:35
Having been a customer for over a year I was told I was making to many api calls and when I told them that the reason was I was testing my website they told me 1 year is to long to be testing my website.
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:47:13
yes would love to get in
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:39:45
Join the club, 
Coinbase is going to keep loosing customers. Its clear to me that coinbase isnt in the future of bitcoin. Bitcoin will move on but coinbase will fall.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:58:57
The api calls were mostly buy/sell or creating buttons. Not sure what limit we hit that made them email us.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:11:41
Agreed, tho I think my story would be a bit less complex. The first time i was hacked the hacker didnt change the email or any info so It was easy and quick to regain control. He has obvisually learned from his mistakes
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:48:00
Very cool, I hope you make a windows phone app.
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:44:13
Id avoid this site. They refuse to give info on who the data provider is for there prices.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:47:32
Well it worked for me, I'm tempted to make a wallet if anyone wants to help.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:13:19
I used my most sercure password which includes capitals, lowercase, numbers and special charaters. Also after the first hack I changed my password to a random password that was was the following, HLMJFxs0X9ggPY7t8QpITizXV/l8XmZTSS8g+T39/P6Mg1yp0ntlzd0EPCvOm+H3x5giYNoxF3upiZP+KhPwYtw=
As I stated in a differnt comment, I think the hacked got access via the secret question.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:23:14
You clearly don't know what your talking about. Coinbase will screw you over the first second they get. I and others speak from experience 
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:55:02
Just another reason to not use coinbase on the long list.
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:49:27
Okay, I was emailing your support and had asked if I move my server for my site out of the US would I be allow to use your sites api. he has not responded to me so i figured id ask.
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:16:52
Well we offer 3rd party judge services so that anyone can choose to act as a judge.
@_date: 2014-09-24 11:17:03
true true
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:07:27
No, tho it will fall just like them tho
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:58:20
no problem
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:04:33
I would recommend checking out mmpool.org or 
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:15:11
true, but to get the current rates and also see the price. Right now there isnt even a good full fledge wallet like android.
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:49:16
well just try /query theymos
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:57:18
Go there and press download and install manually and you can install it. not sure why its removed from the marketplace tho.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:49:02
okay well if you try it and it works update us here, thanks
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:55:10
I would say most big name merchants are not going to accept escrow, but smaller merchants may be willing to for larger transactions.
I would recommend my own escrow site - Escrowmybits.com
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:51:06
well i find the signature the best way as if your account is hacked you know your private key has been comprised or their is a major bitcoin flaw.
@_date: 2014-10-28 01:01:48
good to know, still wish I could use you
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:04:41
We created coinbase buttons for users to pay to. Since our site was not launched tho all the buttons being generated were just being used to test locally. We did not submit fake buttons, tho im not sure how you could to that. We just had lots of unfunded payments since every time we did a test transaction a button would be generated.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:06:18
Not posting my fraud/locked tantrum, but am posting about how they changed the limits on accounts with no notice and then made users get verified. Would strongly advise people not to deposit any funds into the site, and if you do, withdraw them ASAP.

yay free miles

@_date: 2014-07-29 14:47:45
Yes it is very nice and hope you get it released soon. By the way I love a few of your other songs. from tutorials you have made. You really should release the songs you made from tutorials 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:43:00
I would ask the following questions,
When did mtgox become aware of how much was lost due to this bug?
Who exactly thought it was a great idea to disable trading and have the whole site disappear and say nothing for nearly 12 hours?
Is the about 750k bitcoins number correct?
How many funds are in mtgox total?
What are future plans?
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:02:59
Best option would be to do something vircurex style
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:45:06
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:43:28
Well they think when I say I am testing the api it means I am not testing the api and must be putting their company at risk.
Join the club of coinbase not knowing english.

@_date: 2014-07-19 02:09:51
I am sorry to hear that. I can send them an email and see what they say.
Otherwise i would recommend trying a different web browser.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:23:09
hmm weird. My client is stuck at 2 days behind with the above warning. First time this has ever happened to me.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:38:38
I would be quite careful of downloading and using it as a wallet unless you have proof that KNCminer creates it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:33:13
Great to hear your experience.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:49:59
Well they are working on adding more then 30 states 
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:21:13
I am not a huge fan of either brawker or purse.io. mainly as if I use a stolen credit card and then the item gets charged back I am gone with the bitcoins I earned as well as the other party with the item will get in alot of trouble
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:14:58
Yes I can if you want.  I was quite surprised they said that to me aswell. When I then used that against support they decided to lie and say they never said that. My conversation with coinbase recently was quite interested. If you want me to show you it shoot me a pm.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:22:35
I almost fell over when I saw the price. I thought google glass was alot. I think I will wait till 1btc can buy one unit.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:10:39
not at all, My account I simply see as another problem in general. I have after doing my own thinking and from still no help of any bitcointalk mod have figured out that they most likely hacked into my account via the secret question. While I do agree this is my fault, I blame bitcointalk, theymos for any money that is/will be lost. as soon as I became aware of a hack I right away tried to get into contact with theymos in every possible way. As you can see that has done nothing. From talking to other people this seems to happen to all of them aswell
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:57:54
I think the real logical way to do this is to create a mutlsignature address and give have one key held by you, another by seans outpost, and another by a trusted bitcoin community member.

We were creating lots of buttons for payments of which over 75% were not ever funded. Probably closer to 90%
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:58:35
check out trucoin
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:03:06
Sounds like w.e. pool your using isnt working
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:46:22
hey itogo, I have a few solutions in mind. If you shoot me a PM I can help you work out a custom solution
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:24:34
cool video

This is 100% fake, This was posted on bitcointalk by prof7bit.

I have no problem with that once we launch, but we are prior to launch and just testing
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:00:13
In order to launch you must say ok glass, then say bitcoin price. I have noticed it takes a little to load some times depending on the speed of your connection.
Id also like to thank alex dennis for his battery level app that he has open sourced. I used a good portion of his source. His app is here,  
Also a thanks to JustinMoon for his app which I also borrowed code from. His app gets the current bitstamp price which I simple expanded on and fixed a few bugs I found.  That can be found here, 
If you want to say thanks feel free to donate here, 1NAJhu9N3rHHXbhUbtxKfavJFMRPMxEXEC
Feel free to make more feature requests. I was thinking about making a pool monitor. Any thoughts?

Just noticed so does

maybe im missing something here, but isnt this more or less just an encrypted usb? 
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:40:14
I dont think its malware, but they have been down for months nearly 6
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:09:39
I would recommend checking out trucoin which is rather new but is very easy and simple to buy.
Personally I wouldnt use coinbase. There are many stories of users buying on coinbase only to hear 2-3 days later that coinbase canceled the purchase.
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:48:26
having personally dealt with bitreserve and running my escrow site(escrowmybits.com) using bitreserve I think I can clarify a few things.
1. The network fee they charge is just a standard transaction fee. This is basically the fee to take the money you deposited to their address and send it to an exchange to sell. I spoke to them about this and told them that this is really a hidden fee and should be changed, or should have money deposited directly to the exchange rather then act as a middle man.
2. I agree with the whole pricing thing, they really dont show you anywhere clearly. If you use there api you get a bit clearer of a picture, but locking in the price for 15ish mins bitreserve doesnt do as on the back end they physically sell the money.
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:50:43
if I can help in anyway let me know. Id be glad to help
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:07:22
Yes, personally I think an analog watch with a bitcoin price ticker
@_date: 2014-10-24 11:39:50
such device already exists with is the trezor or even the usb bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:02:31
Please google trucoin scam and tell me what results you get. Then google coinbase scam and then see who wins
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:17:24
Doesnt make anysense. You would be better off buying a smart watching and just creating your own app.
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:37:47
Would advise against using,

I had my account hacked on bitcointalk a while back as well. It was horrible. I had to pm theymos on irc for nearly 2 weeks before I got any help.  In any case tho, the problem seemed to be a security question I had set and the hacker had guessed the correct response. My new password is 100chars and my new security question is basically something that is impossible to guess.

Okay thanks I will look into this
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:52:50
sounds very interesting
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:18:19
very interesting idea. Tho I have alot of suggestions/ideas on how to improve it.Care to talk via pm?
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:01:54
thats a good point, right now due to the size you make larger payouts then you would if you minded as ghash.io and got more frequent blocks. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:51:57
Well by posting about this idea you made my setup less secure. This is exactly how I had my wallet setup. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:02:37
Coinbase has been doing this for months. If you disagree with coinbase then you shouldnt use them.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:44:07
That is correct
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:40:15
well my VM is a windows machine, bitlocker enabled as well as password protected. Each wallet software I have on it also is password protected with its own password
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:37:52
that is a good point but as others have stated if you simply use a password then its encrypted and no good to them.
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:52:43
guessing 0.0100 and hopefully i win
By the way, I guess you ended up just giving it away for free, sorry for not getting back to you
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:35:50
Here is a good list, 
Also if your current hosting provider does not currently take bitcoin there is a list here 
Personally I would recommend namecheap and bitvps.
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:03:27
bitcointalk is a place to talk as well as a place where many people trade items or money for bitcoins. In the few hours the hacker has had my account, he has posted about offering free escrow, which he will most likely steal, and posted about currency exchange where the other person sends first.
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:25:16
I would avoid coinbase. Try trucoin
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:10:40
you really should consider using mmpool.org they mergemine more coins then ghash.io and are very small right now.
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:54:45
dont know about you, but I cant seem to view there site
@_date: 2014-11-23 13:15:40
I am not sure what you are referring to? I read through it fine
@_date: 2014-11-23 13:30:25
"Appeal" and "Judges" are both spelled correctly.
"Pick there own" is referring to the Judges, as you can pick your own Judge for any escrow transaction.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:42:17
ahh okay, the only way to do such a thing would be for a someone like an escrow person/middle man to get the coins deposited to a special address at which point he creates the transaction and signs it and then destroys the private key.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:14:45
So I should pay for 5ghs so the site can disappear like all the other cloud mining ponzis?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:31:31
Glad you saw it
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:46:52
No problem
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:34:02
Me to please
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:58:46
I can tell this is a sarcastic post but they have done many good things for bitcoin. For example they bailed out another bitcoin company in the past.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:40:35
Sorry to hear that. There are quite a few similar services tho but there is also alot those services dont do that you could for sure offer.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:42:41
Can you give any IP logs of the accounts?
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:45:07
interesting bitoil card doesnt seem to exist anywhere else and the blog post isnt on bitreserve's site
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:38:07
Yes, also escrowmybits.com allows you to create escrow transactions locking the value like coinapult.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:19:23
okay cool, fyi super3 we talked before when you had the invites. Also for those waiting if you google google glass apps the first link has a few apps on it one of which is a bitcoin price app.
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:00:06
Okay well I have emailed you now. 
Relating to killing off the bitnopoly site as far as I was aware bitnopoly disappeared over night with no email or post saying they had merged. Also gambit existed prior to bitnopoly existing.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:47:04
If anyone is a windows phone dev and would like to help me create a windows phone bitcoin wallet let me know.
I would prefer to make a client from complete scratch meaning that we dont use coinbase or blockchain.info at all and it works just like the android bitcoin app.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:59:49
good choice. You dont want to be using coinbase
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:44:45
Hello Josh,
Feel free to interview me. I have alot of trust on bitcoin-otc, and bitcointalk and have been a very good understand of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:45:00
Typical Journalism........
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:44:49
Maybe I am missing something but what stops you from simply running with the all the money. I mean as far as I can tell your public name is known no where and there is no protection to ensure that seans outpost does indeed get the funds promised.
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:13:06
whats your website/email so we can help out?
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:37:09
As I stated earlier you do not have to trust us as you can simply use multisignature. Also I have alot of trust on bitcointalk as well as bitcoin-otc
As for contact details I am working on adding a phone number but currently we do have a skype, IRC channel, and an email to contact at. 
As for an escrow license, I have already sought legal advice and was told that I wouldn't require an escrow license.
If you have any further questions feel free to post them here or use the contact form to email me.
@_date: 2014-11-23 14:30:23
Judges' should be Judges.
Their, you right I used the wrong one.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:09:13
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:25:09
+1 I would find it highly unlikely for coinfire which is being sued by GAW to be owned by them
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:07:35
That is true, but on the other hand pirate also offered interest at 1% a day and didnt offer you the interest with the coins be held in multisig. 
I do understand that having the site become trustworthy will take a while and I have no problem doing that. I mean look at btc-e. No one really knows much about who is behind it, but it is one of the biggest exchanges.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:42:33
lol nope
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:01:57
The spread I have noticed changes a lot, but for larger transactions like 1 coin and up it shouldnt have much of an affect.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:07:29
care to prove the funds? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:06:43
Dont bother clicking you have to buy a contract to be paid out
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:23:28
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:10:25
Basically right now you have the option to either pick no judge which it defaults to us as the judge, or you can manually select one. In the future I will look into changing it so that if you do not pick a judge it will randomly select a judge for you.
Also, since we charge a 1% fee regardless of a dispute happening there is not any conflict of interests.
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:31:21
I am interested in become a moderator for @_date: 2014-09-28 12:23:48
No problem, but I would assume that is how you got hacked. Since changing my question to something unguessable and changing my password to a 100chars I have had no problem.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:07:35
Here is a nice escrow list, 
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:26:18
Hello, I will gladly help. Sadly dont have that much karma so not sure if I will get in or not
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:17:16
Yes that is true, Which ever way you want, but I think a multisig address is alot easier to do and wouldnt require you manually checking and moving funds.
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:28:37
Well there alot of multisig apis that exist that you could use. 
It really depends on what your service is for how you could best use it
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:24:44
Well the bitcoin you have to trust us if you plan to fix it to a fiat value, but otherwise you can always use multisignature.
Also we will allow you to select your own judge.
As for trust, feel free to check my personal trust rating on bitcointalk and bitcoin-otc. I have been involved in bitcoin for over years now.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:55:12
Is anyone else a bit disappointed that it is not black. I was looking forward to it being black not white.
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:15:10
That is correct. We looked into getting an escrow licenses but it is not something that is required. We are planning to get a license in the future.
Relating to Whois privacy, we plan on changing it in the future, but most escrow websites do use whois privacy including the bitrated.com.
we do not talk much about dispute resolution as it really depends who you select as the judge. If no judge is selected we will handle any disputes to the best of our ability. If another judge is selected he may go about solving disputes in another way.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:34:21
Id hate to say it but Im not sure of any reliable bitcoin debit card. Anyone who has announced it and said coming soon had the card never come.
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:44:38
FAKE 
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:11:18
you are correct, that was my stupidity
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:12:30
Thanks, we have plans in the future to do contract escrows similar to how you are offering them but that is later in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:43:42
It is already being worked on. Someone was award a dev unit for his nymi bitcoin wallet app
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:06:09
tried to get the free miner, but never got the verification code
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:01:36
Made my own price app for those interested. Find it here, 
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:42:49
No it isn't. I doubt he would tweet about it if it was a scam
@_date: 2014-11-01 21:35:37
Sadly there arent many good alternative marketplaces at the moment. A few are in the works tho.
As for escrow there are alot of escrow sites such as escrowmybits.com(my site), bitrated, btcrow and so on.
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:48:53
Well my website is still in beta, but we do offer escrow.
Also here is a link to a comparison chart I made, 
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:58:03
I would highly recommend mmpool 
They mine Bitcoin, Namecoin, devcoin, groupcoin, ixcoin, and I0coin which is more then ghash.io and they are a relatively small pool.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:58:14
As far as I am aware no one has had any problems with them. When you use them make sure you leave a review here so then others users know they are trusted.
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:36:40
lmfao the moral is he took them without paying at that moment to pay later
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:48:54
I have been using cex.io for trading ghash and can say anytime their is a bug or problem they always refund/comp you for it.
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:42:51
Still legally you need to register
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:22:06
I would advise against coinbase and recommend trucoin.
@_date: 2015-05-16 19:41:11
Yes the first link is what I was talking about, I didnt realize they had released main net support.
Copay is just a webapp using cordova but it is still in the end a web app.
@_date: 2015-05-16 17:48:24
Sadly no, there is a testnet one tho
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:28:24
hello I pmed anarchystar about my idea to. Want to get together and chat/share ideas?
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:24:23
You should check out, 
I talked to them about adding bitcoin support
@_date: 2014-10-20 23:56:38
well BR offers more fiat currencies but not gold/silver
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:03:38
I believe you can use bitpay and they do transactions with 0 confirmations 
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:35:54
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:00:15
I guess I will enter, 
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:41:42
Any ETA on US(country) support?
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:52:31
Its a great idea, but has been done so many times and done even for free. 
Anyone can just use  and depending on what carrier they have they can probably get sms notifications for free.
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:31:33
It is an interesting idea, but I would say for starters you should consider doing it using multisignature. You could create a 2 of 3 so that your service holds one key, the wallet app holds another, and then the user has another key that is kept as a backup. 
While this does allow users to skip the saving part, I imagine your app would have a override feature if requested.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:27:17
As I said, I dont think it will fall just for this one reason and I gave more.
For your infomation, my account was sercured with a 21 char password originally which prior to the second hack was changed to something100% random. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:48:28
As mentioned in the bitcointalk thread. The fact that I cant signup, and you respond by saying thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:33:53
I am not sure, but I have tried contacting them and get no response
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:52:11
I have a hashfast 400gh old asic bored that may or may not work
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:22:12
I have a windows phone, Id gladly try it. Shoot me a pm and let me know if you need any developer help, I will gladly help
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:11:58
Id check out btc.sx or btcsolutions 
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:19:30
I think it makes alot more sense for you to simply remove your mining power and redirect it to another pool like mmpool for example that is small but offers all the same mergemine capabilities.
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:53:43
This is great, I cant wait to start using there api
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:10:14
true, but coinbase vault isnt decentralized or trust-less.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:32:10
I like how he said reward points are fixed and no one can create more of them
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:57:45
Any update?
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:50:24
no there are 2 that function as a wallet using api's
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:57:13
that I do not know
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:49:35
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:14:06
hmm all I can this is scam
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:54:00
I can personally vouch for this pool. It is very small and withdrawals are always instant. They even give who ecru gets the lady share of a block a bonus quick consists of all transaction fees for that block.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:29:06
okay, still would be nice if the site was accesible
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:40:43
You may want to setup your emails to not say "Thank you for applying to become a founding member for [TYPE PROJECT NAME HERE]!"
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:37:43
It kills me to see the trezor getting hurt when I could have one in my hand safe and sound.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:26:09
well are you familar with bitcointalk? 
We can use a trusted escrow agent from there if you want
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:43:26
Sadly I cant as the search function doesnt seem to work for me. But if you just search bitcoin atleast 2 come up
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:17:40
Well colored coins is used for similar applications as mastercoin and counterparty
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:11:34
sadly it is
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:15:46
+1 yes I sent them my info as well and never heard back once.
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:38:17
I like it, my suggestion would be to also have a screen where there is a live ticker, and maybe a nice looking chart, then I would be very tempted to buy it
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:18:29
I would say colored coins offers no more bloat then any other bitcoin 2.0 technology
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:29:02
haha guess not ;)
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:36:20
yes but is has gone on and off multiple times. Also the audio quality is killer. I just cant listen any more. I have a headache.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:43:58
Sure, will do. 
Feel free to pm me the tracking info if you include tracking
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:24:20
Interesting, would you be willing to do escrow for one of the units? I will gladly review it for you
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:48:32
I feel bad for you, it looks like that is coinbase. So they should be cancelling them and calling them "high risk"
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:49:17
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:16:55
This same thing has happened to me. It is quite bad and all cryptothrift does is ban the user. Atleast that is what they did for me the one time I managed to get a timely response.
They seem to rarely respond to tickets
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:46:27
Maybe trezor should work on adding a commit to bitcoin core to support it directly then
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:37:05
Okay I have pmed you my address. 
Is there anywhere specific you want to post my review?
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:53:35
Your best bet would be to use multi-signature escrow. Then a 3rd party is involved but can not still the coins ever.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:33:41
wish I could ;)
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:56:46
Agreed people lie, but most anti company posts upvoted have picture proof and in some cases spokesmen for the company have come and posted/replied on the thread

@_date: 2015-01-27 23:13:15
I had spoke to the Bwallet creator about getting one to review, and he said he sent it, but I have not heard back even after asking him multiple times about it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:06:48
They can respond quickly sometimes and other times take weeks
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:09:23
Yes, similar sites exist already. Can't remember the name offhand tho
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:07:04
You most likely had the bitcoins bought via mtgox and stored them their which means basically you lost them.

As soon as it arrives I plan to post a thread of bitcointalk and will follow up on reddit
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:36:18
I will day this once again, it is not the first bitcoin wallet for Windows phone
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:30:26
If the companies are so good, they shouldn't be having anti-companynamehere posts getting published. It is because there are problems and issues that the posts are getting created and then upvoted because people agree with it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:03:48
Got the same email, I think it is legit
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:06:13
I dont know about that, I have had a trezor since release and had nothing but problems. I have finally emailed them telling them I want a refund and I will return the unit.
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:24:12
Hate to say this, but you are not the first wallet. There are 2 or 3 other wallets that already exist on windows phone
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:04:39
who exactly decided to integrate those specific crypto-currencies into ROKOS? Just seems like it would make a lot more sense to use the most popular or biggest market cap.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:29:52
well I assume you will not ship it to me on trust that I will pay once i get it?
What is your bitcointalk account?
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:20:54
I am a bitcoin user.....
Feel free to check my trust on bitcointalk and bitcoin-otc
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:10:19
Coinapult works similar to bitreserve. Coinapult sadly doesn't work in the US but bitreserve does. Also Escrow my Bits also does pegging to exchange rates but only for escrow transactions 
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:28:23
Well my first recommendation would be John K from bitcointalk who is known to do many escrow and is well known and trusted. Otherwise I would recommend someone well trusted on bitcointalk or bitcoin-OTC and can refer you to a few people I know who are well trusted, including my self.
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:21:40
uphold has to make money some how. Its only fee free after you provide all your info....... 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:31:19
I would say it depends on how long it takes for your computer to sync, and the exact reasoning your using bitcoin core.
I have a very low end computer running bitcoin core and it takes about 3-4 hours to sync 1 week of data. So for me it needs to be on atleast 4 hours a week to stay up to date. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:19:11
I would recommend using coinapult, they do exactly what you want. I would advise staying away from bitreserve/uphold as its called now.
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:51:04
Case wallet is quite horrible. It honestly could have been something great though. The wallet itself is decent but the software is quite bad. There support is also extremely lacking. I had high hopes for it and have regretted my purchase ever since
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:04:24
Its an interesting idea, but without making users hold their funds it isnt much use as anyone can lie. Your site would have to also check for lies.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:48:42
Thanks, I am sorry about that, I will make sure it is handled right away.
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:41:04
Very nice, Id be interested in buying one. 
What exchange does it use tho?
Also another great feature would be for address tracking. So when X address gets any payment it could light up or say it on screen
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:26:28
a lot of reasons, bad communication, selling your data, requiring KYC/AML, ETC..  
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:04:00
Likely had a static 2fa as a password which kraken supports for some weird reason
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:19:45
Im sorry you are having an issue using our website, please send me a PM with your transaction ID or create a support ticket and I will make sure the issued is resolved as soon as possible.
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:50:57
there is no reason coinbase should be on bitcoin.org. I personally think circle should not be on the site either. Coinbases main purpose is not a web wallet, it is an exchange.
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:20:05
I personally dont know how coinapult works on the backend, but I am just telling you what bitreserve told me.
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:09:50
Yes it is quite a bad clone of the website, but I would prefer to see no one get scammed by this website.
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:57:52
Exactly where is your evidence that cloudflare(cloudbleed) is the cause? Seems more like you are just blaming cloudbleed for being hacked
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:26:43
Do not click this link it is a fake website.
@_date: 2016-06-11 15:28:07
I can think of quote a few, escrow, public hash/notary services such as stamp.io, multiple web wallets such as blockchain.info or Xapo
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:58:29
"No one ever expected team Bitcoin to change any rules because of Mt Gox."
I think that is about the worst example possible. Mtgox people deposited over years, how would you even change the rules to get everyone their funds back? The DAO its all in a smart contract.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:56:33
Sounds about right. I took my money out of their site months ago. They have many bugs which are never fixed. Trying to login was a joke. If I was able to login once every 10 tries it was a good day.
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:07:41
Could very well be to low of an amount, guess they hoped if they stole small amounts of money the people would just disappear instead of trying to get it back.
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:32:01
agreed, that is the way to use exchanges, the problem is when you cant even trade and the funds just magically disappear
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:44:51
Posting on social media in an attempt to get us to simply disregard policy and refund your bitcoins will work not.
If you want support you can respond to the support ticket you have open. While you try to show that we close your tickets with our a response, you have opened 3 support tickets for the same issue, and our support team has simply merged them into one ticket. Our support team has also told you numerous times that the seller of your transaction has canceled the wrong escrow transaction. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:03:54
Honestly it wasnt even a lot of money, but after searching about this issue I am far from the first person to have been affected and HitBTC has done nothing to fix/resolve the issue or even admit it is an issue.
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:02:01
Thats like saying any exchange in the US wont scam people because they are in the US
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:18:33
Escrowmybits.com we are the only escrow that offers to peg the price for you.
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:17:02
That is incorrect, they offer wire transfers using synapsepay for us residents.

@_date: 2016-11-27 21:17:07
Hmm okay, just trying to understand why I would want to use Authparty over Bitid or visa versa. Not sure 100% how BitID works, but I would want to use something decrentalized and not reliant on authparty's server still existing
@_date: 2016-12-27 02:36:27
Yes really. Coinbase 2012. Kraken 2011.
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:23:08
Very cool, but could you clarify how this differs from BitID or simply just having a user sign a message to login?
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:01:48
oh okay, well from what I was told the hosting costs of the site was very high. talking in the tens of thousands and that was a main reason for closing
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:26:26
very nice looks like it will be a lot better the trezor which has nothing but issues
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:43:50
You can use escrowmybits.com
Disclaiminer: I own the site
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:43:49
funds appearing twice, funds disappearing, funds refusing to send, accounts disappearing/reappearing
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:07:24
Yes I knew that, Its quite high. And it limits you to a max discount of greater then 50%
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:54:17
Sorry to hear about that, I had a lot of issues and quite horrible support from them with my service and its one of the main reasons why I chose to use Coinapult instead.
While I havent had any major issues like yours on Coinapult, there customer support is lacking and I have gone days with no response from them.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:18:39
Sadly I do not think I can disclose that. I assume you bought the code or something?
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:26:13
sure shoot me a pm with your email or skype
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:40:42
Having personally spoke to the people at Brawker, Last I heard they were still trying to sell it for an crazy amount. Not to mention from what I was told, the backend was a mess and was/is the reason they closed
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:05:36
ah okay
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:28:59
From my experiences the trezor is quite bad. I would buy a case wallet instead
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:44:17
Yes, maybe not using mytrezor is the solution. Just most of the other wallets do not support all the mytrezor features. So you end up buying a trezor and loosing half the features because you do not use mytrezor
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:43:19
last I checked you can not even set a 52% discount
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:12:29
Very interesting that bitcoin-xt is on the list
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:09:36
sure, where to start, funds disappearing, accounts disappearing, not being able to send, and funds appearing twice
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:54:54
No offense but that doesn't mean much. You should put it in escrow or something
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:47:43
I have personally had nothing but issues with it
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:22:56
My first question would be was it an instant order or name your discount?
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:33:47
Yes, but I highly advise against making any deposit
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:44:11
If you already made the purchase, chances are the funds are lost
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:05:32
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:31:45
Well then its most likely just the amazon seller making a mistake 
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:02:37
does not seem to work in IE or Edge
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:27:33
Yup basically, but we also offer bitcoin pegged to fiat on blockchain. This means a multisig that is pegged to a USD Value
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:20:41
Not really
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:35:09
Its called stupidity, lets not help the network and make small blocks. That makes sense.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:01:08
Also escrowmybits.com which has similar services for judges and all users coming soon.
Disclosure - I own escrowmybits.com
@_date: 2015-08-14 01:50:50
This idea would never work. Mainly as if everyone had a 10min period to submit blocks in, for starters the same issue can occur if I find a block at 9 mins and 50 seconds and I can not upload a block quick enough.
On another note, the idea of a 10 min submission period basically more then doubles the amount of electricity that becomes wasted.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:04:29
That might be true but I have no idea and trezor support was far from helpful
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:33:48
I mean I understand the logic in using credit cards, but it can be done using bitcoin multisig.
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:23:44
I think the is the easiest way to rationalize it. Hopefully in the future it will be cheaper and be a bit more competitive.
I agree with you on bitcoin volatility. The aim of the site tho is really for one of the parties to not want to deal with the volatility and also be protected in the case that either party tries to scam the other. 
For example you might not care about the bitcoin price short term, but the person you are buying an item from using escrow might. They do not want the bitcoins to loose value if they plan to simply convert it to USD or another fiat currency when the escrow is released.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:03:41
You have to remeber that purse.io is not the one that buys items. Its users on the site. SO you can not blame them for that. There are many other things to blame them for, but this isnt one
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:58:14
FYI its VIRWOX
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:21:31
at what point does bitreserve or anthemvault put any item or asset on the blockchain?
FYI: it is never. If tether for example put a tethergold asset out then they would fall under this
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:48:50
ah that explains it, I was hoping more so rather then give my CC details at all
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:12:34
typical coinbase behavior
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:56:20
I do not appreciate you telling me it is user error.
Id understand user error where I delete an account or send funds to the wrong address, but connecting the trezor, and logging in via mytrezor and having random problems like I mentioned is far from user error.
The errors/problems I mentioned went on for months at which point I ask trezor to simply refund me or replace my unit and they said my unit was fine and I was the only person having said issue. 
I am not sure why because one user has issues that does not make the unit possibly defective.
All my errors/problems I sent logs to of trezor and I have around 20-30 emails going on for months back and forth between me and trezor having me try different firmwares and different connector software. 
I even have them saying that one of the problems is a known problem with the only work around being to not use mytrezor
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:59:29
see my above comment about the fee. We only charge 1% one time for the whole escrow. Any other fees charged are from other services such as a miner fee like you said

Most likely due to the new law that could pass relating to crypto-currencies
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:33:22
As I try to tell other people, Time does not equal trust. Meaning just because a site, or company has been around for 2, 3, or even 4 years does not mean they are trustworthy.
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:43:34
still could be though. Just since it was name your discount, purse.io and the buyer for your order never see/get your address so the mistake is from amazon or the amazon seller. 
I would just wait and see which item you ordered does not arrive because that is the item with the mistake
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:51:29

If you search crypto portfolio on google quite a few web sites come up though.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:50:06
Well I do not know about that, but if your trezor had funds appearing/disappearing, refusing to send, and even having whole accounts disappear, would you say its safe?
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:17:59
Agreed, I think Nubits has quite successful so far and I plan to add Tether and eventually BitUSD too using shapeshift
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:07:46
Thanks, we plan to add tether and bitusd soon.If you have any suggestions please let me know
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:04:47
A 1% fee is quite small and lower then most other escrow agents and sites.
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:05:20
good luck getting any changes done. There support kind of sucks
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:58:23
Escrow my Bits does have 2 conversion fees, but they are simply shapeshift's fee. We do not charge a fee for converting back and forth. Just a 1 time escrow fee of 1%
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:52:29
Join the club man. Coinapult was half way decent when Ira was the CEO, it has quickly gone down hill. I made a ticket a  few days ago, and still havent heard back, but the fact that your at 4 months means I likely never will.
If you did any of their backend, I would really be interested in talking to you.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:54:58
Yes this is correct, tho when we decided to leave bitreserve, they still had fees and we were not aware of the planned change. Another reason we left was lack of communication
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:23:02
Okay will do sadly I am now having login issue. Even tho my password is right all it is doing is refreshing the page and not logging me in.
I have a feeling it has something to do with my 100 char password
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:38:10
personally I have used Gyft and while they say it is instant, I have encounter many times where it takes a delay from 10 mins up to a few hours
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:49:07
I am unsure, but I was told that it was my fault by trezor. So I know I would not trust a cent with a trezor. I will be buying a case wallet
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:20:08
being a brand new site I think it will be hard for people to blindly trust you with their money
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:25:12
Well The 1% escrow fee does not effect the overall cost as 1% of nubits or 1% of bitreserve is still 1% so they simply cancel each other out.
As for the shapeshift.io fee. I am not sure of the exact fee but I thought it was a lot less then 1%, but I could be wrong. Last time I use shapeshift it was quite close to market prices.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:30:20
cool I cant wait
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:51:16
That is true, but it is hard to know how many people are using purse with no issue. It could be 99% or it could be 1%
@_date: 2015-07-18 02:43:55
Thanks, I have sent many emails and skype im's and at this point I have no intention of going back unless they change
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:50:11
While I do not think all purse.io buyers are involved in fraud, from my personal experience most seem to be
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:05:57
Guess they want to loose the bitcoins
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:34:01
It is pegged to the USD. so why would I want to pump it? If I pump it is no longer pegged to the USD and then the whole point of the coin failed
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:00:03
The disadvantage of using Bitreserve tho is that it is not decentralized and they can freeze your funds
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:51:16
Well I spoke to purse.io a few months ago about partnering with my website to offer bitcoin pegged to a fiat value. But in typical purse.io fashion I never got a response. After confirming they got my email, they promises to get back to be but once again no response.
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:54:30
Yes this had happened to me many times
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:11:29
wow that is quite surprising. I will admit of the 10 to 20 people I have spoke with not one has had a good experience.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:28:58
That is a perfect way to put it. Purse needs to get its shit together and fast or someone else will come around to replace them.
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:18:25
Yup join the club, has happened to me many times
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:48:19
nope just mine, I type them myself. Sometimes spell check just does not seem to catch them all
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:28:29
I really hope you dont believe that.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:05:39
That is just an explanation of how the full reserves works. Yes they have a ledger updating 24/7 but nothing stops them from backdating records or even having real time fake numbers in use. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:05:52
No, coinapult is used for regular escrow only. Nubits and shapeshift is used only for escrow pegged to a fiat value Coinapult covered all loses and even upped security to all multisig
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:58:14
Yup, there service is just meh
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:30:32
Would you mind naming a few?
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:32:22
Why should I bid? I cant even pay with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:56:10
As I mentioned we do not force users to use Nubits. they can choose to use coinapult if they want and I have no problem adding bitreserve back in as an option assuming they get things worked out and are able to communicate properly
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:54:07
There are many reasons both good and bad to use or not to use nubits. I plan to offer users as many choices as possible so the user can decide what they do and do not trust
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:03:00
He said NC not NY. May want to read a bit better
@_date: 2015-07-18 02:24:01
Agreed, tether is next on my list. Honestly, I originally planned to open beta the website with tether, but the RPC calls I needed didnt exist and still do not. I am talking to the omni(mastercoin) team and working to get the needed RPC calls implemented so that I can add tether support
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:17:59
As mentioned when we changed to coinapult at the time they still did.But we also left due to there lack of communication
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:08:47
Okay well make sure you signup for our Newsletter then, tether support is on our Roadmap so you wont have to use an altcoin soon :)
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:21:11
Yes  I tried to get them to and they wanted info that I didnt know. Like when my last bitcoin withdrawal was, to what address and the exact amount
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:00:48
Its a good idea, and serveral sites have attempted it in the past but all of them have disappeared into the void. For example one such solution was to allow you to add a extra fee on top of any transaction to have it confirm sooner, or to have a double spend over-fee another spend. 
For example User A sends a transaction with a 0.0001btc fee and realizes the current network fee rate is 0.0005btc. So he uses X website to add 0.0004btc to it and whichever pool adds it in gets rewarded this extra fee from the website.
The problem with this is that it requires all pools using/checking a website. 
On a more widely accepted way that I recently remember reading about was a BIP that would allow a child transaction to spend a large fee and pools would then prioritize the parent and the child because the fee combined was large
Edit:unrelated, open source the code you use to redirect users in NYC to  as I would use it on my site.
Also its a bit flawed, as people in NJ and CT cant view your site
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:00:59
Very cool, Know I know what to use my points on
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:44:38
I wish I could say that. After months of issues and trying different trezor software versions I told support to just send me a replacement and they refused to saying the issues I was having was not a defect or a software/hardware issue.

Would highly advise against using it. It may still be alive, but its far from safe. For example they turned on 2fa for all accounts even if you never activated it so now any old accounts with no 2fa cant login
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:49:15
Not sure what you mean scam? Not my fault trezors do not work
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:31:15
Yes I have tried 3 different wallets with nothing but issues
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:32:24
agreed, but it so far has seemed to be relatively stable
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:27:21
I think you mean coinapult over bitreserve.When this project started I was originally using coinbase. Then moved to bitreserve due to the many problems with coinbase. Such as over requesting info. Bitreserve started out good, bit slowly there lack of communication made me switch to coinapult.Coinapult is used for all pegging off the blockchain. On the blockchain we use nubits, and eventually tether and bitusd
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:15:30
So your solution to no one reading your blog is giveaway money in the blog post. So basically pay people to read that seems a bit sad.
On another note, more people might use your site if your support staff was half way decent and you actually responded to emails instead of just not.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:50:33
lol, my fault on the spelling mistake
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:43:12
Yes they are horrible, the one time I used the exchange my withdrawal was stuck and it took me emailing support 10 times no response, to emailing the owner of the exchange whose email I got from a friend, to get a response
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:14:24
Nope, we can, but we are currently blocking NY due to the bitlicense
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:52:25
Yes I did notice it and its quite great that it uses XAPO which is much better then the tyrant coinbase
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:03:28
guess so. They even refused to refund me :(. so now got a trezor gathering dust
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:34:41
uhm probably because that site is a scam
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:02:42
Not sure what you are asking?
Escrow my Bits offers bitcoin escrow pegged to a fiat or commodity value
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:29:16
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:58:26
I personally own escrowmybits.com, thanks for recommending us.  If you have any questions or concerns feel free to ask
We are not run by Coinapult, but we use their service to allow users to peg escrow deposits to fiat and commodity values.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:42:35
I agree that its r/bitcoin, but my service is mainly for bitcoin. It even has Bits in the name of it. I just do not see the problem with using an altcoin that does something that bitcoin currently does not?
Do you consider tether a shitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-13 13:30:52
Damn no windows mobile support :(. If you make your windows 10 app a Universal app it should be portable
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:50:15
This is why you should use escrow
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:49:31
I will agree my ledger wallet feels quite cheap, but I personally have a trezor and while yes it might be secure, it feels cheap. I am not saying it isnt secure just that it doesnt really feel solid in your hand. Just personal preference I guess.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:03:52
haha that might be
@_date: 2015-08-29 12:42:00
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:29:28
Edit: managed to login, but still can not seem to pay with bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:16:28
Yes that thread was created by a scammer I had upset who decided to bash my website. All the claims have no proof what so ever though. 
If you look at bitcoin-otc you can see that all the negatives are fake as well. Being in the bitcoin community for years eventually gets you some negative ratings and publicity. The best example of this is coinbase. They do not scam users, but every week or two you see someone post and complain about how coinbase suddenly canceled a buy or locked their account.
In any case, thanks for considering us and good job on looking into our site before depositing, but you might want to dig a big deeper next time to see all the posts are fake. If you check that reddit thread, all the posts come from brand new throw away accounts. Not to mention they have no proof what so ever.
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:53:59
By buyer so you mean buying bitcoin or buying amazon stuff?
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:01:22
I see your point. My logic is for 2$ I will settle and be happy that my funds are decentralized and not up to the trust of bitreserve
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:58:47
You really need to hire more support agents. Site has been getting worse and worse
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:28:15
this seems typical coinbase to me. You might want to research the company before you decide to use them
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:22:54
Yes that is correct. Another good point brought up about the advantage of using nubits besides being decentralized is that for example if Bitreserve gets hacked it could loose all your money or get money stolen. Compared to nubits where you have to loose your private key, but you are in control.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:32:09
lmfao if that is true that is quite sad that if you ask for the info they just give it.
@_date: 2016-02-13 16:41:37
dont forget the keepkey
@_date: 2016-02-13 16:54:51
ah my mistake
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:14:10
Last I checked bitstamp lost customer funds, they just decided to reimburse users using their own funds
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:47:47
No offense, but why would you ever store the same key on 3 trezors that is quite stupid. I understand your logic of a backup trezor, but if you forget your pin or passphrase on one trezor you screw your self and have 3 useless trezors. Not to mention if they find a trezor security flaw your screwed.
You are a lot better off using either a different hardware wallet in the safe with different passwords, or just using a paper wallet that is encrypted with a different password.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:33:45
dont forget keepkey and case wallet
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:46:27
Not sure what your problem is with coinapult and why you claim they are insolvent. Being hacked and refunding the money is the not the same as insolvent. Bitstamp was hacked and refunded users and they are still around.
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:27:10
Yes a hardware wallet is a good idea. Keepkey, case, trezor, ledger, etc...
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:15:06
I think it depends what phone you have. I watched a nokia lumia run over by a car and hit with a hammer and a nail and still not even show a crack
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:27:00
This is more so like a paypal for gold that happens to accept bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-21 13:29:17
I would say bitfinex, tho I still do not recommend storing funds with them.
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:20:05
I am surprised to hear that. I understand maybe a 2 of 3 multisig, but the same key on 3 devices doesnt make much sense to me
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:01:46
The keepkey is meant to be a consumer and premium hardware. Have you ever held a trezor in your hand? One drop and its broken. Its made from cheap plastic vs Metal with a keepkey
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:29:05
it took you this long to do that? not the 100 other posts that complain about coinbase
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:05:38
Haha, well I wouldnt say nubits is a shitcoin, I am not familiar with any other alt-coin that is trying to be pegged to the USD and is completely decentralized. The closest one that comes to my mind is tether.
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:39:04
Well, not sure how you would like me to prove I do not own any Nushares to you
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:46:51
okay cool, I look forward to it
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:42:37
No offense, but why would you trust a bitcoin escrow service with no ratings anywhere.
Id check  for trusted escrow sites and always check online for ratings
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:30:02
Well Id imagine they would want us to use the site so they can get rid of some of the carding money, seems not tho
@_date: 2015-07-27 00:31:28
glad to see one person is having success with purse. Cause 99% of us are having nothing but problems
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:51:50
I would check out  for a good list, also you can use 
If you have any questions about Escrow my Bits let me know(I run Escrow my Bits)
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:33:27
well lets see there is circle, trucoin which are both not exchanges, or I can use bitstamp, btc-e, and many other exchanges which exist
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:34:47
I am not sure, but we use shapeshift to convert your bitcoins to nubits should you choose to deposit bitcoins, but you can also deposit directly with nubits.
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:27:26
well like I said, I think the shapeshift.io fee is a lot less then 1% and is closer to market rates.
As for bitreserve proof of reserves, the whole thing is far from proof. Its more or less them just saying what the total users balance is and how much of it they have. They numbers are very easy to fake.
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:10:40
Yes we use Coinapult for fixed fiat escrows off chain, and we use Nubits for on chain pegging.(tether and BitUSD pegging on the way)
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:16:30
Yes I was the first to ask
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:53:24
Lol, that may be true. I mean in a basic sense purse does nothing that can't be done on a forum. They simply make it easier.If purse becomes much worse, I might create a clone
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:55:01
This is great, I cant wait to use it. Any plans to a universal windows app? Then you can port it to windows phone and windows desktop. You could probably even port it to xbox or hololens
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:29:44
40btc, I dont care if they never go bankrupt or get hacked, you should not store that much with one site. your just asking to have it all get stolen.
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:05:26
Hi there, I own escrowmybits. Do you have any proof what soever to back up your claims? I am more then willing to listen and have a civilianzed conversation about it.
Since you are questioning my trust, feel free to check out my trust on bitcoin-otc here, 
You can also check my bitcointalk.org trust under the same username.
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:39:07
you have absolution no proof of this. This website is 100% custom
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:12:52
That might be true, but how do you know the company doesn't have reserves which can cover costs. 
Not to mention simply saying since other free alternative exist means the company cant do well is a horrible example. Their are many completely decentralized bitcoin exchanges yet all the exchanges are still getting users.
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:58:05
lmfao yes I should use this site and be scammed
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:21:47
Yes that is correct. We use shapeshift on both sides. For converting to nubits and then converting back to bitcoin. 
Users do have the option to deposit in nubits and withdraw as nubits too.
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:38:29
I will politely say you are screwed. If your account was hacked you basically need to talk to theymos and prove you are who you say you are. Getting in touch with theymos from my previous experience is very hard and can take days if not weeks.
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:02:03
being on the market for a long time does not mean it will suddenly cost less.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:41:59
you might want to check your link again. It shows up fine for me.
You also might want to get a few more throwaway accounts if you plan to continue bashing our site as well as get some real proof.
@_date: 2016-02-29 08:21:43
Owner of escrowmybits.com here, if you have any questions or concerns feel free to ask
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:29:26
Agreed, I am with you 100% that you should not keep funds with any 3rd party unless you are trading or planning to trade. I learned my lesson with mtgox
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:40:56
Ill take it you have tried ;)
Edit: id like to see a stress test of hardware wallets, keepkey, trezor, case, etc.. run over by a car, flamethrower, etc...
@_date: 2016-09-18 11:06:34
That makes sense, we also support milestone payments so you could do a deal for 100k and then pay the supplier in parts. So 5k after he does something, then another 5k, etc..
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:50:41
This is why you should escrow
@_date: 2016-09-07 15:12:24
I would advise against trading on yobit unless your planning to have your funds stolen.
@_date: 2016-09-22 00:03:06
He lives :)
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:40:47
Well my logic in using multiple passphrases and hardware wallets is it limits one fault/problem. For example forgetting one pin or one hardware wallet sharing some exploit.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:33:20
tried this as soon as it happened, it didnt work sadly
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:33:00
I can assure you its not fud and can provide a picture. Also all you need to do is search "hitbtc funds gone on transfer" and you can see many people reporting the same thing. hitbtc has made no public statement or even acknowledged its an issue. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:37:23
Interesting, so to me that seems like a very bad way and maybe illegal way of doing things. Just from what that post says, having a sell of 1 BTC at 100 USD and then a 10 BTC sale at 50USD would mean an avg of 75$ for 11 coins which is not the real gain or even close to it.
Maybe UK laws are different but I cant imagine the above is a legal way of doing taxes. I would suggest consult a tax professional
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:32:36
Cool, the electron documentation and getting started guides are quite good. The software I built was my first time using it as well, if you do run into any major issues happy to help out. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:09:11
I'd be glad to help, you can check out our website here, escrowmybits.com. We also support pegging to a fiat value so you suppliers do not need to worry about the bitcoin price changing.

If you have any questions feel free to pm me.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:43:24
Having built similar software If you dont mind me asking I have a few questions more so out of curosity,
1. Can you clarify what is meant by categorization? For example to me everything is more or less a trade. An airdrop is just a trade where it cost me 0 or half of my original investment to split cost basis
2. Since you support so many exchanges, how do you handle fees and other assorted costs related to a trade?
3. How is the USD rate decided for a crypto to crypto trade?
4. How do you handle currencies name being changed?
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:29:51
There is a difference between being obliged and being proactive and deleting the data automatically once accounts become dormant.
Ideally we do not need to trust centralized services like yours. Its bad enough we have to give all our info to centralized exchanges, why should we give it to another centralized service?
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:30:56
So the software I am making can be found here, appreciate any feedback you can provide, 
As for other projects, I would just do a search on github for some and you can find, see here, 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:35:51
Mind showing where you found this? As far as Im aware atleast for the US, FIFO is preferred but not required. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:34:51
Not sure why you call that a backend script, the whole thing could be a simple electron app. The only real reason to do a website IMO is its easier to get money that way and manage accounts, vs having serial keys for software and then having desktop software.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:55:18
1. Not sure I understand how this is really categorisation, that just sounds like some basic code to say if airdrop then costbasis is zero.
2. Well exchange fees are but transaction fees for instance typically arent including in exchange trade fees but can often times be related to a trade. For example depositing 1 Bitcoin(0.00001 BTC) transaction fee, then selling for 50 litecoin and then withdrawing the 49.99 litecoins. In the above I had 2 transactions fees 0.01 LTC and 0.00001 BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:32:59
If your concerned about your data/privacy you shouldnt be using centralized services. I know there are a few free, open source crypto tax solutions, including one I made my self because I didnt want to trust a 3rd party service.
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:34:01
Not sure, like I said all I know for sure is they refuse to give me my trade history unless I get verified which I wont do.
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:36:05
Yeah join the club I hope someone starts a class action against them so I can join in.
@_date: 2016-09-26 17:52:00
So very true, sadly people wont believe it until it happens to their account. They say oh he must have been doing some illegal or gray area. I am not doing any of that stuff so I am okay. Then account closed.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:51:08
Ah okay that makes more sense. I am still not sure if that is legal so probably worth confirming to be sure. 
The benefit of that assuming its legal is that all the coins are more or less equal and its predictable more or less vs doing something like FIFO where you would have a larger gain and then LIFO with a much lower gain.
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:40:27
Im not saying it shouldnt be legal, I just cant say it is 100% legal as I am not a tax professional
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:51:53
The fact that you dont know what it is a scam is quite sad. I highly advise against depositing anymore into this site
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:08:14
Well really I was interested in both apps just to mess with. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:13:38
Great to have another windows phone bitcoin solution. I am going to download it right now, but in the mean time I must ask 2 questions,
1. Does it have live tile support to show your balance on a tile?
2. Any plans to add a background task to check for a balance change and then send a push notification or something?
Edit: on your website you have a few other bitcoin apps, but I cant seem to download/find them in the store
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:32:49
Id gladly help you, but really there is one 1 major question that has to be asked. 
Are your funds on a website or are they at an address?
If its a website you can most likely recover it somehow assuming the site is still alive and running.
If it is an address your chances are near 0%
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:06:27
Someone a few months back did a comparison survey comparing the cost of using regular methods compared to asic heating methods.
The end result asic heating I not cost efficient say the current price. The price would need to be near 1000 to make it worth while
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:32:30
Cool, well you should consider just atleast putting the .xap or .appx file up for download for those that want to mess with it.
@_date: 2015-09-19 21:48:53
Just another project in the long list of discontinued/dead software
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:33:09
Scam much?
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:01:57
really? more ponzis
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:45:01
/me pretends he didn't buy one either
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:04:39
I personally use btccharts as an adobe air app pinned to my taskbar.
Obiwan used to show you the live ticker when you hit a specific key, but it only worked with mtgox so it is no use now.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:35:31
agreed, while I will say the packaging it was shipped in was hard from tamper resistant its good to see the insides are
@_date: 2015-09-18 22:49:38
yes they also disappeared with money of anyone who paid for their pro membership level
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:10:06
hmm good point, well now when people look it up, they will find this thread
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:03:40
Does not work for windows 10 FYI
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:49:22
See my above comment about how horrible seedcoin is
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:48:00
Yes that is true. I do not like the idea of at best only having 1 key
@_date: 2015-09-28 03:53:06
Hey Nadav,Long time no speak. I am still interested in some type of a partnership between our sites.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:28:40
I agree its hard to realize just how fragile the device is in pictures, but I get the same feeling holding it in my hand. Honestly if someone made a case for the Case(wallet) I would put it on to not damage it. 
It is not so much that it is flimisy as much as it is simply uneven. The center on mine protrudes out more then the rest. Almost like if it was in my pocket and I bent down it would split in half
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:05:37
I think that site is a phishing site. The real domain is BTCRow.com not BT-crow.com
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:25:51
agreed that is a simple solution. While I understand the reasoning for not using it and shipping as is since the key is not generated until you activate it and create an account, it still can not hurt to have the packaging more secure
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:23:11
you can explain all you want. Put your money where your mouth is. Bet me 1btc that the site will be around in a year and still paying, or even that it wont disappear overnight and take users funds.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:49:24
agreed, another complaint/issue I have is simply funds being stuck. On a trezor, ledger or other hardware wallet you can get funds off without having to communicate with the company in any way, but with the case assuming I choose to store the 3rd key myself and Case(company) decides to disappear overnight, my funds are stuck. 
Atleast as far as I am aware there is no way for me to get the private key off the device or use it to sign a raw transaction without talking to case servers.
@_date: 2018-07-01 11:57:54
thanks, if you have any issues/questions just let me know
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:46:40
agreed, compared to what other companies have shipped or in some cases not shipped I can't complain
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:47:08
Clearly they don't know how to treat their users.Please don't get me started on seedcoin. There general lack of communication, blatant disregard of investors funds, And laughable website makes them almost the worst company, if you can ever call it that, I've ever dealt with.
@_date: 2015-09-19 23:12:52
well from my brief experience with them, that seems just in line with how they acted
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:46:01
lol, I think I should just to an audit. I mean I have no experience what so ever but why not :)
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:47:37
Very nice list. 
Glad to see my site is on it. If you have any questions about Escrowmybits.com feel free to ask me.
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:58:02
I am sorry to hear you were scammed. You should always double check the escrow site and make sure they are trustworthy
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:36:57
Its funny to see you posting every wallet. I just got mine and had similar complaints you had.
The serial marking sticker is the biggest joke. I am scared to use my case because I may wear the stick off. 
relating to the fingerprint cut out, I agree completely the cut out is not very professional looking. Almost like it was an after thought.
@_date: 2015-09-28 03:51:07
This is exactly what escrowmybits.com was created for.
We can peg the value on or off the blockchain using coinapult or nubits.
Fyi: I am the founder of escrowmybits.com
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:53:48
will I do think the whole site is fishy, they did respond to my ticket yesterday created prior to the site going down saying they were working on the issue. I have not heard anything back since then tho
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:34:59
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:29:53
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:15:37
Haha yes.
Having dealt with seedcoin to apply for the seed funding and then not hearing anything and contact them 5-10 times through many methods I finally got ahold of someone through linkedin. Basically no one at seedcoin is paid. Everyone is volunteer, not that excuses them. After speaking with one guy(not going to mention names), he also basically blew me off for months and I have given up on dealing with them.
From my personal experiences with people in the bitcoin world, 99% are all talk and no action with no follow through.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:34:12
Well if you go with the reccomend setup like I did you actully end up with 1 of 3 keys where they hold one key, and then 3rd key holds another and the case holds one. 
As for a pin rather then fingerprint, I prefer this too and it is a planned feature they told me
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:08:37
Haha, the good ole days
@_date: 2015-11-21 19:34:44
nice, you should consider just giving out the raw transaction or attempting to push it via blockr or blockchain.info push tx api
@_date: 2015-11-07 14:01:02
Well seems like it is 3 days now from when the downtime started and no word
@_date: 2015-11-22 16:00:08
that sounds about right. Either that or they are selling users info. In either case it isnt good
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:01:59
completely agree
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:09:03
Interesting 3 days of downtime damn. At this point if they are legit id expect all accounts to be credited to some degree. Thats the only way id even remotely consider using the site again.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:55:36
lol same but it wouldnt surprised me
@_date: 2016-10-06 22:59:58
Good luck
@_date: 2015-11-18 00:09:32
I would disagree. Thats like saying the apple watch is compatible with windows phones because it has bluetooth and could connect, but someone has to create all the code for it to work and hack it together
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:55:18
Yes I was credit and successfully withdrew. Tho it was only about half of what I should be getting
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:19:07
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:11:03
thanks, they did the same thing to me many months ago, were they were offline and they didnt refund or anything. I had hoped by now they had improved and fixed all the bugs, but clearly not. Honestly the second they come online I am withdrawing w.e. funds they havent stolen/scammed me out of and not using it ever again.
Atleast now when users search Coinarch scam this thread will come up and people will know not to use it. Right now searching it returns nothing
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:58:46
Not at all, coinapult charges the fees directly and you aware of what they charge. Plus they request no info from users. 
This is exactly why I stopped using Bitreserve/uphold for my site(escrowmybits.com). I have had nothing but issues and lack of communication with them so I switched to Coinapult and have been happy since.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:51:42
hmm okay, at this point with the site being down now over 24 hours, if I get anything back from the site Id be surprised
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:22:24
yes there site just changed to that. Well I will see how this progresses.
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:52:11
Just got this email now, but my email says Bitcoin solutions trading is shutting down not coinarch.
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:54:25
Edit: future reference Coinarch, you may want to actully include a timezone when you say at 23:59. As that means nothing
While I understand your reasoning/logic, Going from past experinces of sites, they will probably just cancel all orders and resume trading at a specified date/time. 
Do I think this is the correct/right way to do it? No not at all. They should cancel out anyone who had a long and simply give whatever the funds were at the time of closure, and for any shorts, they should simply keep them open.
Lets be honest here tho, how many users do you really think they will have left after they reopen their site. I would say everyone who has participated in this thread is pulling their money out, and id say almost anyone was has seen this thread will likely do the same. 
If they want to keep users they need to make everyone happy which is really giving everyone free money and fixing there broken system. Do I think they will do this? Nope, I'd say the best they do is simple make their site fee free for a month which lets be honest, no one is going to care as the second the site goes live, everyone is withdrawing funds.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:03:14
that is true, just from mine and many others experience coinbase is far from good.
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:09:52
why would you ever deposit anything more into the site. thats like asking for it to get eaten up
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:13:53
While they may not be an outright scam, I have lost quite a buy due to there site that they won't give me back. From stop orders closing early to values changing
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:12:27
Maybe purse.io and Clef?
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:04:14
Not really new, this site has been around for ages
also nice try, trying to use your referral code
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:21:54
Would highly advise any buyer/bidder to use escrow.
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:33:21
All I am saying is many people have a similar story as you. Buying 100's of times with no issue then suddenly coinbase asks them why they are buying so much, or they claim you sent to a known gambling address, etc....
@_date: 2015-11-22 16:00:25
lol, hidden feature
@_date: 2015-11-17 14:28:46
Yeah, sadly based on the experience ive had so far I doubt I will get anything back
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:23:03
I will shoot you a pm
@_date: 2015-03-22 11:21:13
Very true, escrowmybits.com(my site) solves this problem
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:32:04
Here is the bitcointalk thread, 
I would advise against putting any money into it
@_date: 2015-03-22 23:59:50
Good point, sorry about that, 
FYI, I have edited the post
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:30:04
join the club, I cant even stay logged in for more then 1 minute without the site auto logging me out.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:56:32
While I like BitID in general, I find it a lot easier to simply ask users to sign a message use that to log them in.
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:47:38
well not I cant even login
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:42:01
Yes I also recently did a small trader for about 70$ and hopefully I won't have any issues
@_date: 2015-11-08 21:53:26
yay the site is back up and I still have a 0btc balance
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:44:47
looks like an update has been posted on the site saying "We are currently experiencing a technical issue. We are working to restore from a database back up and we expect to be back up and running at 23:59 on 8 November 2015. We will notify all users should we be able to rectify the problem sooner.Please note all your bitcoins are safe and accounted for. Our security has not been breached. We thank you for your patience with this matter."
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:57:14
Very nice site. Any interest in integrating Escrow my Bits for an escrow service?
@_date: 2015-10-17 01:23:56
lol, agreed
@_date: 2015-11-07 14:00:25
sorry to hear that
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:44:44
wow what a flip, from ripping coinarch and then deleting all your old posts to now saying how great they are. Sadly some of us are still waiting on refunds
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:32:25
Not sure about mycelium, I am sure it is possible, but you would have to look into it further.
@_date: 2016-05-28 19:52:19
Not sure how you can say number 1 for a site that just launched. In that case you are probably the Number one site to be scammed on.
@_date: 2016-05-07 19:31:44
Not sure what escrow service you are using but it doesn't sound very trustworthy. You should mention in the OP what the escrow service is to stop others from using it.
Next time you need escrow check out my site, escrowmybits.com. If you shoot me an email before you use it, Ill even make your first escrow free :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:24:40
I would say if you open a store, make sure you use a trusted escrow site, 
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:57:27
good idea
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:03:31
lmfao that sounds about right
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:53:12
Well then your phrasing of it is compatible is a lie then.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:09:19
well, you really should add a contact button to the site
also I cant login. It says my password is incorrect, but it is not
@_date: 2015-11-22 16:01:55
You mean a company is lying to its customers. That cant be.........
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:33:21
that is true, I might have to upgrade to a rasp pi 2 ;)
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:47:31
Not sure I would consider a Jupiter legacy quite yet. It for sure is not efficent to run, but if you have free power it may be worth it. I would say a BFL FPGA or 5gh unit as legacy.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:40:40
exactly. Maybe the next person who reads a post will think twice about using coinbase and then not throw a tantrum when they get get screwed
@_date: 2016-05-08 19:20:17
I'd have to agree with Shesek1, a regular escrow service is not very secure and can just run away with your funds. Not to mention the site just launched 
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:23:21
Yes, most wallets have it implemented, blockchain.info, electrum, armory, multibit, coinbase(even though they are not a wallet)
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:28:05
And we are supposed to blackarrow? I wouldnt
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:09:28
very nice, I look forward to using it. A huge fan of your site.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:43:32
yea exactly, seems like he just cloned it
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:19:23
It only makes sense to use if the hacker does not realize that, or if you enable global settings lock. Then the hacker can not disable the 2fa as you have just done.
@_date: 2015-03-19 23:10:27
cool, are you the creator?

from my personal experience with boost.vc they are unprofessional and disorganized.
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:21:16
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:18:33
Yes, its true you can simply login and disable 2fa for withdrawals. You need to enable global settings lock in order to not allow this. Check out the support article about it here, 
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:07:00

I disagree, simply because the protocol and/or documentation does not exist for the apple watch does not make it not compatible, it simply makes it very hard to make compatible; Vs The ledger blue which is not currently compatible, but can be made compatible easily because the documentation is open. Your definition of compatible seems to be that they can talk easily once software is made that allows them to do so. 
If you look up what compatible means "capable of being connected to another device without the use of special equipment or software." or "capable of being used with equipment in a system without the need for special modification or conversion."
Personally I think the second definition makes more sense for this use case. I would also consider having to create software to allow it communicate would be a special modification vs downloading an already existing/compiled/developed app which would not be considered special modification.
Edit: didnt mean to rant, just I have preordered smart watches and other smart devices that say compatible with windows phone, then never release software or simply drop support.
@_date: 2016-05-01 21:15:53

Well I would say you should help new users get their first bitcoins as well as use some sorta escrow service to protect the buyer as well as the seller. 
Here is a list of escrow services, 
On a side note, what is your ebay profile? I may want to buy something you have.

This is why you need to not store funds online in insecure wallets/exchanges.
This is exactly why purse.io should change how they operate And not allow users to hold funds on their site. The only reason for it currently is for market buffer, which can very easily be eliminated using true pegging such like my site, escrowmybits.com offers. 
I tried to partner with purse.io but got nowhere
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:34:16
same, just tried to login and saw that

no problem, glad to help. I use your code quite a bit for some of my projects. the least I could do is help
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:00:05
You need to get over your self. You lose your 2fa and then go and blame the company because your incapable of properly backing up your 2fa. Your the reason why exchanges take days to respond because stupid customers lose their 2fa and then want to cry to support to fix it.
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:10:17
your goxbtc must already be in bitcoin builder. if they arent you cant recover anything
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:38:23
Yes. Or go and complain on reddit for a problem you caused to happen. There is a difference between going to reddit because they you are missing your money for weeks compared to going to reddit because you lost your 2fa key.
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:13:36
very interested in testing. Feel free to pm me
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:31:20

okay thanks
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:43:03
Again I never said that. I didnt say dont email them and ask them to reset it. I said dont post on social media and complain about them for an issue you caused yourself.
I am sure glad I dont have you as a customer and feel bad for the companies that have to deal with you and others like you.
@_date: 2015-11-21 19:36:21

Yes good idea threaten the exchanges when you lose your 2fa device so they have to spend money on lawyers instead of customer support
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:59:17
I hope so
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:02:28
Did I ever say that? No, I said you shouldnt go complain about a company for an issue you cause to happen to yourself. If you lose your bitcoin private key you dont go and post about how bitcoin sucks because you lost your own private key do you? Or when you lose your car key? You dont go complain that your car company sucks do you?
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:52:34
Im not saying to be perfect, but you shouldnt go around complaining about a company for a problem you caused to happen to your self.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:25:54

No, your trying to get people to spam coinbase support in the hopes that someone complains enough to get someone in charge to do what you want. 
If you dont like what coinbase does, then leave, dont spam them in hopes of getting them to follow your whims.
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:44:00
what is the website?
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:48:21
Having personally dealt with seedco.in, I can say they are far from professional. Most of the VC I have dealt with are quite rude in general
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:52:33
well Its more of the work needed. Its better to let bitcoin core stay as the reference client then trying to add advanced features
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:51:10
Good point, but many other wallets aren't open source yet people use them. I agree it would be nice if they were open source though.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:56:11

@_date: 2017-07-24 18:48:46
Oh man well since one guy threatened to close his account they better listen now. Do you honestly think they care about 1 guy. Even if everyone who subscribes to this subreddit closed their account, thats nothing to coinbase. They gain that many users in a few days.
Also good idea to flood them with support requests. That will help them speed up responding to real customers(sarcasm). And people wonder why bitcoin companies cant keep up with support requests, its because people like you flood them with garbage emails all day.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:16:32
I agree chrome makes it easy for everyone as it is multi-platform.
I wonder if a nodejs desktop wallet is possible using Electron and being cross platform would be possible?
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:54:13
Thats good to hear, but my concern is more so with the browser it self. Just any flaw in chrome(or firefox) could potentially effect the wallet.
Just also seems counter-intuitive to me if I want to use my wallet on an offline only machine that I need to install chrome to do so.
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:13:35
+1 on this, the trezor it self may be fine, but I can only speak towards mytrezor which is nothing but buggy and horrible. I had the trezor since first release and had nothing but problems and stopped using it over a year ago. Just a few days ago I decided to try it again hoping it was less buggy and still nothing but problems. All I was trying to do was sign a bitcoin message and it gives me an error.
As for the problems Ive had, basically every one possible. Funds not appearing, funds disappearing, whole accounts appearing/disappearing, and now being unable to sign a message
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:18:09
I understand it can not(in theory) extract my private key, but there is a lot of other information someone could steal. 
Not to mention they could also perform attacks where they change the address and/or amounts. Of course if you look carefully at address this wont work, but lets be honest, everyone in one situation or another has rushed to send funds without checking an address.
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:52:41
You might want to people more information. Just saying email me with no information is only going to attack bots.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:14:46
I disagree with that. Simply assuming because your wallet is open source does not mean it does not have a flaw or bug. Atleast if it is closed source someone can not dig through the code to find a bug and exploit it. 
I would prefer it is open source, but being closed source is not a deal breaker.
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:45:16
2fa can only be removed if you do not enable global settings lock. If you enable global settings lock or even just enable 2fa for logins then 2fa is needed to make any changes.
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:31:28
Sounds like it's not just mytrezor but trezor in general
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:50:24
Good point, sadly I do not have an android phone. I simply meant it would be nice if more wallets supported completely standalone desktop programs.

Guess you got one of the good units :). what web browser did you use?
I am not sure which competitor I would be working for as I have so far complained about every wallet excluding keepkey and ledger since I have not tried either one.
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:16:57
Sadly there are no good wallets, Case wallet was quite good, but they have basically done no updates to it and quite recently they had sending become broken for everyone and didnt even make a notice or anything about it and pretended like nothing happened.
As for the other wallets, most other wallets require you use chrome which I find completely crazy. Why do I need to use chrome to use a damn bitcoin wallet, it makes no sense at all. As for usability, the only wallet I have not personally used/tried the software on is keepkey and ledger.
On a side note Bitlox as a wallet seems to be quite good, the software has a few parts that seem weird and it has a general slowness to it, but I have not had any major problems with it.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:26:22
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:46:37
The user has to enable global settings lock..... he clearly didn't. 2fa for funding works fine, but if you don't enable global settings lock, then its basically useless. 
It would be nice if kraken made this clearly though as clearly a lot of users do not understand this.

I find the longer/more often you use any service the more likely you are to have an issue. If you have used them a lot and only had one issue I would say that is quite good. Rather then starting at a brand new site and having many issues right away.

We did invest in many other domains to protect our customers such as escrowmybit.com and escrowmybtc.com. I thought a .net or .org compared to a .com was enough of a difference that someone would notice.
