slight semantical nuances notwithstanding- yes, correct.  






good assessment, i'd say you've got it.

very cool to hear, thx for relaying.
did/has he mentioned specifically the nature of the project?  given his outspoken advocacy for scaling/L2, it would be great if the project was L2/lightning related.

awesome, i've been thinking about this as well. do you have a link?

parroting the same old false narrative, *sigh...*
anyone can choose to run an LN node.  anyone can start one, shut it down, create another, ad infinitum.


***laughable!!!***  LN has onion routing for privacy and multi-sig nLockTime contracts by which fund confiscation is impossible.
i'm sick of fucking shills like this guy spewing consequence-free FUD.  anyone know if an objective blockchain betting mechanism exists by which i can challenge this assclown shill to put his money where his stupid fucking mouth is.

minimum is 1.  *useful...*  that's another criterion entirely.  starting with a single channel to well connected node might be considered useful.


good question.  an earlier look at [route discovery code]( requirements suggests constraint scope limited to 100 iterable nodes and 20 max hops among them (best i can remember).


LN will do that for you...  however, with what criteria (other than the 20/100 above) i am curious about as well.

not exclusively.  it's one factor among many others.  


*competitive*, maybe.  profitability is an entirely different proposition.    motivation is as well.

where's the template for the notes?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:06:14


constraining scope to technical (business/marketing/etc excluded):
- well funded channel
- consistent uptime/availability
- low/competitive fees
- fast network throughput / low latency transactions
- multi-channel connectivity
- minimal hops to other multi-channel/popular-destination node(s)
- *off-chain channel funding*
and likely many others (pls advise).


yep, correct.

@_date: 2017-12-24 13:41:47
transaction *amount* is not the point of contention, transaction *volume* is.   
bcash specifically promotes on-chain scaling for *any* transaction volume.  
but perhaps i'm mistaken, do you have  evidence of bcash supporters claiming bcash as a limited use case?   i don't believe that's the bitcoin they imagined.  it's certainly not mine.

clear &amp; concise assessment &amp; representation, much thx��
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:57:53


legit concern, i share it as well.  
from initial look at [LN routing / path selection code]( it appears channel selection criterion is currently limited to number of hops to destination.  
that being said, i've heard that LN channel selection does include lowest-fee filters (as we discussed), although i didn't see any such  conditions in the selection algorithm.  i'll have to look again to see if/where such conditions (or others) are included/specified.  
if you come across related info, pls advise.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:49:13
[objectively verifiable]( is not synonymous with *something i don't agree with*.  in fact, objectively verifiable does not consider what i *believe* to be true at all, only what objectively *is* true.

if a sufficient number of nodes are running that flavor of LN, absolutely.

in rational debate with sound logic, objective evidence and reputation/etc consequences for being wrong, sure.  but this ain't that place.
among all negative effects, FUD/falsehood proliferators here:
- have economic incentives to bloat forum discussion *ad nauseum*.  such that many people, esp newcomers, don't have time to wade through it all, much less do so with any objectivity.  they often get confused, stop reading and/or leave altogether.
- incorrect information, sufficently repeated, begins to be received as objective truth- and nearly always has to be addressed in damage control.
- even the most productive among us are not without temptation to be distracted by sufficient shill/FUD.  they pull valuable *people* resources away from critically needed, important &amp; specialized work down into the fray of those having the lowest/base economic output.

1.  correct
2.  first mainnet transaction (i.e., using real bitcoin) was performed nov 19

1.  it secures *your* bitcoin (value), assuming you own any
2.  also run a lightning node on it &amp; enter fee/profit market

as is addressed in the video (and I'm paraphrasing here), make it easy, applicable and worthwhile, and people will simply choose it over traditional systems.  curious if you've personally tried any of the bitcoin wallets and found them to be detracting from traditional systems?  in places where bitcoin is accepted, i've found it to be quite the opposite

1.  physically write down private key / passphrase / passwords from your bitcoin.com (shill) wallet.
2.  download a quality wallet, greenaddress, brd, just to name a couple.  these wallets let you choose your transaction expediency fee and also create a segwit enabled address.
3.  import your bitcoin private key / passphrase / passwords from step 1 into wallet downloaded in step 2.
4.  use wallet from step 2 to send btc at significantly reduced transaction cost, esp if you're using/sending to a segwit enabled address.
moving forward and and for others getting into bitcoin, as mentioned by other responses in this thread:
1.  do your research before using bitcoin.  bitcoin.org and are great resources for information, faq and community support.
2.  do NOT use the bitcoin.com wallet...  for reasons you'll discover during your research.
