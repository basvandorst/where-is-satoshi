Don't know why this is getting downvoted. It's exactly the reason. People just want some kind of sign that Mt.Gox has a plan working on something. 
If Mt.Gox was insolvent, then they wouldn't even try to make a fix.

I'm not sure if it is yet..I might ask around. But I did read some 2ch threads that had posts from monacoin users. In those posts it was clear that they connected Bitcoin with monacoin as the "Japanese version of Bitcoin" (笑). However, I don't know about the rest of the 2ch community.

For 99% of people out there, it is too late. 
You can still be profitable for example if:
1) You have a new ASIC design that can pump out petahertz
2) You already have a ton of money, and decide to buy out a line of new ASICS.

@_date: 2014-01-02 04:51:58
I tried peercoin. I really did.
But I still have some problems with it. The fee for 0.01 transaction cost does not cover the infation rate, so we have an inflationary currency...
Also, there is only one developer(?) Sunny King? Why? 
The claims that it make about being energy efficient compared to Bitcoin are true; however, Bitcoin actually doesn't use so much energy. Especially if you compare Bitcoin to Visa or any credit card company, the energy use is surprisingly less.
All in all, peercoin makes a good effort to be different, but I can't really see it having the momentum to make an impact.
@_date: 2014-01-05 12:20:48
This is not a serious failure of Bitcoin education.
It is indeed a serious failure of computer / cryptography education. 99% of stolen Bitcoins are because people don't understand general computer security (which is different than Bitcoin education). Think about it, it's mostly people who use the same passwords everywhere, using a malware infected OS like Windows, hosting their wallet online, sending coins to scam sites, etc.
The other 1% is a problem with "Bitcoin education". For example, not understanding how "change" works and losing Bitcoins from a paper wallet import.

I will be honest with you, I think exactly the same way. I have about 80% of my net worth in Bitcoin which many people may think is way too much.

@_date: 2014-04-28 22:02:21
First, calm down. You obviously have anger issues that need to be resolved.
Secondly, if someone else also knew the private key to these coins then it becomes more difficult to seize them. The other person could just simply move the coins to another address.
My point is that ''seizing'' bitcoins is not as simple as it may seem to government authorities. Im just interested if the guy in question took any measures to protect his assets.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:10:59

Not really a question, but quite honestly I am disheartened that a majority are selling their bitcoins for cash.

That's just it. I don't want Apple to "embrace the technology behind cyrpto-currencies". I've had enough of their shitty elitist attitude. Apple products lock you down, steal your money, and prevent you from feeling like you own the product. I can't wait for the company to die.

Bitcoin is pretty strong compared to last year. I'm surprised out how fast the space is heating up. 
It's just how networks grow. A telephone is useful if only 2 people in the world have it. And it is twice as useful if 3 people do. Every user who joins Bitcoin brings something, and it's starting to show.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:54:58
It depends on what you used to generate that address. Unfortunately, not all generators are created equal, and some do not provide enough entropy. If you were to mine addresses of a generator that used pseudo random numbers, then you could find collisions more easily.
Undoubtedly, there are probably many addresses generated without enough entropy, and I expect that those addresses might be mined in the future. It is important to take this into consideration when generating your key pair. This is also the reason some people roll dice.
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:57:15
Are you joking? The market cap was $9bn last year, and we had only a 1/5 of the companies we have now even remotely interested in Bitcoin.

But in other countries, there are more female programmers (in my classes, the only female programmers are from India and China so lol). And they have actually heard of Bitcoin!
So, it seems more related to a person's interests rather than gender in my opinion.

Not true, it probably IS more scarce. A lot of people who wouldn't normally have bought in did because of the price decrease.
Assuming those who panic sold / shorted are going to buy back in, then there are less coins from the available pool.

I believe he is correct with that statement. 
We've seen multiple posts about what happens in the event of a 51% attack. Andreas even said himself that the number of transaction confirmations become meaningless! That's a pretty good reason to not have trust in the Bitcoin network if you ask me.

You are referring to an interpretation of Revelation 13:1 right? If you are really concerned about it, then Bitcoin probably does enable this to take place much easier than currently existing fiat currencies would. 
However, will it actually be Bitcoin or something else, no one knows for sure.

It's pretty obvious. The author makes assumptions based on a few bad actors and chooses to exclude breakthroughs that have happened in the past few months.
Look at the graph he drew. He must not understand network effect because otherwise it would be based on an S-curve. He doesn't use any of the data that blockchain.info provides such as "number of transactions daily" or "number of mywallets created". It's easy to see the current trend of adoption, and this author chooses to ignore it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:33:21
We know. I think most of us can agree that it will take some time before we can wrap the Bitcoin protocol with layers to make it easier to use.
Good news though. It's already happening. Look at Bitcoin ATMs for example, or Coinbase / BitPay. Isn't that a miracle? I'm so thankful that I have other options to get Bitcoins other than mining!
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:16:45

@_date: 2014-01-17 23:22:24
You should learn about forks.
 Forking code generally implies that a subset group of developers have a different idea of how the software should be developed. They fork the Bitcoin code from Github, and then modify it the way they want.
If the core developers became corrupt, it is possible that a different group of developers would fork bitcoin and start developing it differently.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:39:32

You could have a monitoring service that looks for unauthorized transactions. When one occurs, immediately another transaction is made to a different address that you are in control of. The difference here, is that with the second transaction, you attempt to pay a higher fee. This way the second transaction has a higher chance of being accepted.
I was actually considering to make something like this, but it requires that you have a pre-signed transaction that has not been broadcast yet.

[This]( is the only news article in Japanese that I've read regarding Bitcoin so far. 
My wife (who is Japanese) tells me that people generally trust cash. If you go to Japan, you will see that people generally don't use checks, credit cards, etc. If you go to a restaurant or even to the mall, most people are paying in cash or coins. Yes, some Japanese are going to use credit cards to pay online, but not if they can avoid it. Take Amazon for instance, most Japanese prefer "dai kin hiki kae" (代金引換). Which means, that you order the product, then pay at the time of arrival. Part of it is also "herd mentality" like another user suggested. 
Japanese often think that it's very interesting how westerners use credit cards all over the place. (Why would we divulge so much information?). 
So considering all this, especially how Bitcoin operates similar to cash, it does seem like Japanese will favor it. Probably, there is some education required. Once Japanese see this, they might be more open. However, I personally think that high inflation is not going to be the driving factor to push Japanese to go with Bitcoin. Japanese have seen high inflationary periods many times in the last ten years, and most people do not try to combat it by buying gold or whatever. It will probably take a great majority of countries majorly adopting the currency to persuade Japan that they should also. They are acting conservative about it.
[EDIT] People will use credit cards for large purchases. But it's not preferred at all.

My guess is that we have an S-shaped growth with an overshoot for hash rate. Miners will leave as we reach the peak of the overshoot, but at some point it *will* still be profitable to mine due to fees. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:19:58
To be honest, I used bitaddress.org, and I cloned it from Github.
BIP0038 doesn't generate the wallet. You can roll dice to generate your wallet if you don't trust entropy. 
I'm writing my own Python script to implement BIP0038 with PyCrypto. I can't prove that PyCrypto or Scrypt didn't make any mistakes encrypting the wallet. I do know that I can decrypt the hash / encrypt the key and still get the same values.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:40:17

Getting your coins stolen is no fun. But, try making BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets. It will put your mind at ease. Do it on an offline Linux system.

Yes, very good point. In that case, I would assume I would do something like this:

2) Make first transaction from bitcoin client to buy whatever.
3) Send all remaining BTC from bitcoin client to a new paper wallet.

Exactly my point. The contract could be such that you must take "some action" before the coins are released to your address. 
If someone just immediately sends you "x" amount of bitcoin, that isn't contractually binding. Which is why, I see us utilizing software implemented contracts much more as bitcoin gains popularity.

In that case, Bitcoin could end up becoming "SurveillanceCoin". Lobbying moves from regulations to actually implementing specific changes to the protocol itself.

Debian is a great choice too! 
Debian and Ubuntu share the same package manager (apt). Distros that share the same package manager generally have the same access to software. If you look into it, you will find that Ubuntu was actually based off of the Debian distro.
Arch uses pacman which has it's own set of software. In the beginning, you could say that pacman did not have very much, but I find that now pacman offers pretty much everything I need if you include ABS.
As far as I know, you cannot use the apt package manager with arch. So just like you say, the package manager is something big to consider when choosing a distro.

I can't really say I've diversified, but going 100% one way or the other is not wise.
However, at this point, I trust BTC more than US dollars.

At least it is only 3btc. Some people lost ridiculous amounts.

It's ok. Coinbase is just making sure they can complete the transfer without risk on their part. Bitcoin is cheap and fast; you're just dealing with the legacy banking system which is slow.

Ask your parents to get a verified account on Coinbase.com and buy some Bitcoin that way.
99% of people are going to strongly advise you to not mine. I'm not going to list the reasons, go use the google.

If you look at the charts and see that a significant bounce back from a high fall has **not** happened, it generally means that the price will fall more until it **does** happen.
Wait for that point, and buy.

As a buyer, what if I don't have 3BTC? I only have 1BTC which is enough to buy the item.
Also, I have a hard time imagining that buyers are going to want to risk 3x the amount that they are willing to pay for an item (even if they *did have* have 3BTC in this case).
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:27:07

I really like the figure in that post. Makes it clear to understand.
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:34:24
I see your point.
However, I'm somewhat disturbed considering that we've seen the outcome of 51% attacks on altcoins. It may not end all confidence in Bitcoin, but we would probably need to take some convincing action to minimize damage.

To each his own.
If you are concerned about the market, think about this: There are 2.8 billion dollars "printed" each day in the U.S. But only 3600-4000 bitcoins minted each day.

I would say that I'm in a similar boat. Although I made my first two bitcoin  purchases during the stealth phase of the last bubble. I also bought from 1000 down to 380. I'm glad that it's going to pay off!

@_date: 2014-03-05 04:51:47
It's the opposite of what you're thinking. Investments are made in BTC, and dividends are also in BTC. So you benefit twice.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:32:09
That is not going to go over well. What happens if the case I write something like 


"サ" is already used short for "サービス", and in this case means that the charge for service is included. I've seen quite a few times サ coming right after a number to indicate the amount you pay for service.
It really should be a symbol that is not part of language. Especially since Bitcoin is to be used all over the world, and it is not restricted to a country.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:51:23

If any new developments take place that do not benefit the majority, then the code gets forked, and the best branch wins. 
Obviously, if the core devs decide that they want to introduce some change that does something ridiculous like add a backdoor, people running nodes would just reject that update.
@_date: 2014-11-24 05:35:54
Yeah, I saw the Luke Jr thing, but it seemed like it was brought to the attention of the community pretty quick; however, you are probably right. I'm sure that there are miners who aren't consciously checking protocol changes.

@_date: 2014-06-06 04:47:15
Personally, I don't think Apple, eBay, Dish, or 50cent have anything to do with the price rise. This rise happened before we heard the news of all of that.
However, those events might help support the current price..
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:35:34
This is the correct answer.
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:17:15
Part-time nodes are actually detrimental. You should have a machine that can be powered on for long amounts of time if you want to help the network.

Bitcoin aside, I currently live without a car and it is awesome.
Some people think it is strange especially since I don't really live in the city, but you save a ton of money. I also get free public transportation so there's that too.

This is what I love about the Bitcoin community. Serious about security and updates. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:12:34
I like everything about bitcoin, but this is my primary reason for converting my funds over. The risk associated with USD perpetuates the benefits associated with bitcoin.

What is promising is that he has a history of repaying which speaks the most in my opinion. For my investments, usually there are one or two that are a day or two late. 
But like I mentioned, try to get MAC's listings. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 07:12:08
I don't want to buy anything.
Not enough merchants give discounts for using Bitcoin (some even mark it up!). Customer service people have no idea how to handle refunds. Too much price volatility.
@_date: 2014-09-07 13:19:09

@_date: 2014-03-08 03:52:13
Try not to think of Bitcoin as a commodity. Try to think of it as a network, and you'll see the value. I can't send gasoline to any place in the world in a second.
Media and governments try to label Bitcoin as a commodity because they do not understand the protocol.
EDIT: I want to make a point, think about the blockchain. We have this incredible public ledger that proves transactions actually occurred or that someone owns funds! That is why the network is valuable.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:52:36

There is no reason to buy altcoins. If you look at CoinMarketCap, then you will see that 99% of those coins fluctuate with respect to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin falls, those coins fall. If Bitcoin rises, those coins rise. It was clearly evident this last Friday.
However, I do mine Primecoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:31:11
This is such a great idea! I have the same thing going on at my work next week. I might do the same thing :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:47:30
It's ok, just calm down for 2 seconds. Coinbase allows you to lock in your price, so you don't have to pay extra if the price increases. They have been faithful to deliver coins so far, but they take a little longer.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:53:35
I'm mining primecoin, but only because it's easier to make money for me. I hold mostly Bitcoin, but I recently just took a slight interest in peercoin just because it's different. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:20:52
Nothing. But they probably won't make profit at that amount.
It's not as simple as "the price is cheaper on one exchange compared to the other". There are other factors involved. For example, it is rather difficult to get fiat out of Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:01:08
Bitcoin is a rocket ship. If it's going to crash anywhere, it will be the moon.

Before buying bitcoins, I discuss with my wife how much we are going to buy. I admit that I want to take more risk than she feels comfortable with, but I respect how she feels.
Maybe next time you might try discussing it together and agreeing on a value that you are both comfortable with? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:10:17
I think so, last I heard it's very difficult to get anything in JPY. There is tons of room for bitcoin in Japan. Vending machines, 改札口, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:26:08
Wait a minute, I'm genuinely concerned now. Is it a problem if Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value? Any good explanations on this?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:34:28
Yes, and I'm not sure how you are downloading it, but torrenting it is my recommendation.

Apparently, there are some efforts to decentralize pooled mining. I read about them on StackExchange: 
To summarize, they are working towards taking away the ability for pool operators to control which transactions are included in their blocks.

If you have zero fears about Bitcoin crashing, then go for it!
Banks could do whatever they want with your money, but not with bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:41:57
That's what I've heard, but I've made at least 30 buy orders, and I haven't had any issues. I do live in a really rural town, they might not be aware of Bitcoin yet. 
But I fear that if I sell Bitcoin to get USD, then they will raise some concerns.

ahah, yes that's generally the consensus, but I would really like to see something technical..
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:25:31
It is market momentum. China "fueled" the growth (as you say) compounded with media attention, so a greater populous now has an understanding of Bitcoin. 
Even if China backs out, that does not mean the growth that was spurred during the time of Chinese appreciation falls away. We can also think that now people see more potential for Bitcoin reaching higher prices than before, so the current value around ($720) is not extraordinary, rather it is viewed as expendable.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:31:42
I had the same thing happen to me..except it wasn't Christmas. I had to start all over again!

You need to stop. Respect your father for his opinion. If he's not comfortable with it, then that should be OK.
Forcing anyone to use Bitcoin especially when they aren't comfortable, don't understand, etc. is not going to end very well.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:58:21
Can you give a list of some shops accepting Bitcoin in China?
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:39:25
If Bitcoin becomes worth that much, you won't "cash out". You would just purchase everything with Bitcoin. Additionally, I don't think there will be many people selling Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:53:06

Should you be investing in bitcoin if you are a broke college student? Maybe, maybe not. But I wouldn't put in what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:57:04
Thanks for sharing. I needed to be reminded of what's really important.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:22:27
Yep, put it towards BTC.

Seriously? Doesn't anyone proof read their papers any more?
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:32:32
Also, in relation to your original question. I don't think there is much significance waiting for the value to drop marginally before buying. If you are seriously considering to hold for a long time, any fluctuating price right now will not matter years later.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:28:09
Wow, I seriously feel like ripping my laptop apart after reading that.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:18:14
The motivation? We live in a day and age where it is becoming increasingly more essential to understand and interact with technology. The average Joe may not feel pressure right now, but they will. I wouldn't call it "motivation", I would call it "survival of the fittest".

My commentary states:


So, I guess before trying to figure out if the QR code is the mark, I'm waiting to see who fits the model of the beast and what he promotes.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:06:13
From what I've seen, most of the alt-coins that exist are derivatives of Bitcoin that don't change the protocol so much. Faster transaction times, block size, etc. are not impossible for Bitcoin to model. 
However, Peercoin's PoS is a change that Bitcoin could not switch to at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:01:22
Bitcoin will continue to be a roller coaster. China will probably not be the only country that does something like this.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:31:08
I know! Seriously! There's got to be more people than me holding right?
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:44:22
Is that what satoshi looks like?
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:04:05
I could be wrong, but mining contracts are not a wise decision as far as I have heard.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:21:53
This is huge. I like this because it puts you in control. I feel way better being my own bank and knowing exactly how much money is getting sent.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:33:04
I use coinbase also. Hasn't failed me yet. However, I transfer my coins to an offline wallet immediately once I receive them.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:24:02
The problem is, there are too many people who don't have the balls to be spartans.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:35:58
Nah, the government knows they can't do shit at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:37:39
What do you mean "Bitcoin can no longer be used to buy things in China"? What kind of nonsense is that?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:12:42
The government is a joke. 'nuff said.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:57:17
China seems to be homesick, so it's slowing us down.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:36:20
I thought about this, but still not sure..
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:15:44
It is always a good time to buy bitcoin. It is never a good time to trade bitcoin for fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:24:06
I don't get it, are you sharing bitcoin? In that case, don't. It kind of goes along the lines of "never share your wallet password". 
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:47:45
Yeah, that seriously took me forever! good luck! 
Once you get those scanned, I think you'll pass me. I'm super stuck lol.

Is this wallet locked?
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:48:43
Absolutely use Linux.
But! It won't protect you from being stupid! Don't just use super user like crazy on some third-party package. You need to use common sense because Linux can still be vulnerable if you allow it :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:25:47
If you just want to make money, just buy bitcoins and hold. 
If mining is fascinating to you, and you enjoy supporting the network then that's different.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:32:37
I'm not worried, I think after some time Chinese will continue to hold bitcoin and do transactions secretly. Right now, there is probably just a lot of FUD
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:53:12
Don't try to mine. Mining is super specialized right now, and you will not make enough to cover your investment.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:00:32
My wife and I laughed so hard seeing this. Man, the tie seals the deal.
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:21:06
By far the easiest way is to look into Bitpay.  . 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:30:31
I think so too. 
It's hard to say, but I think as bitcoin gets more backing and the market cap increases, then there will be a big push to get more QA and testing involved in the open source project. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:23:28
It's not too late
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:49:22
Pics or it didn't happen
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:18:40
Hm, it's hard to think why I would want to promote something I don't know very much about.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:33:16
How do they know if I'm holding bitcoin? How do they know I haven't given it to anyone, or if it's still mine? I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:25:52
It's not a huge issue if bitcoin becomes the most popular currency. At that point, it's actually fiat currency that is volatile, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:29:57
I'm sure another company will spring up and create better ones.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:14:03
Here is what is happening.
The Chinese government released some rules about financial institutions handling Bitcoin. This caused a major stepback, and caused the Bitcoin price to fall. As soon as the media caught hold of it, that added more fuel to the fire. Speculators who have invested in Bitcoin without seeing the long term value or understand what Bitcoin "fully is", are now selling.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:54:35
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:50:20
No dig such fail.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:46:52
I agree. We have too many people only looking at the price. When you think about this past month and how much Bitcoin has grown, it's amazing! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:57:52
There is no "bursting", that would imply that it goes to zero. I don't see that happening unless the system is hacked.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:15:25
The location is kinda ... meh.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:41:12
I remember a thread noting that there intrinsic value exists also in the blockchain since it keeps a record of every transaction.

@_date: 2013-12-07 05:32:29
Posting your bitcoin address on any post is just a really good way to get downvotes.

I just got level 2 yesterday! It's a good feeling isn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:29:01
This confused me too! Read this
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:13:32
I think I'm starting to get more greedy. I didn't think I was before! But after seeing Bitcoin soar in value, now I realize that might be the case.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:30:33
Yes, we do need parallelism. I do agree with that. 
For "Solution 1." that you proposed, how would you determine when a blockchain starts? Would that be time based?
My understanding is, the first "blockchains" would have more transactions associated with them than proceeding ones thereafter. Wouldn't the Merkle tree for the blocks contained in the first "blockchain" continue to grow? If that's the case, then the problem is only delayed...
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:36:03
Just saw this one.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:37:47
I think you missed a decimal point before the "1"

The transactions on your donation address look ...interesting..
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:12:24
When you compare this to the distribution of wealth (fiat) in America, it doesn't look that bad.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:57:56
Don't forget that bitcoin is not stock.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:45:53
Wow! Thanks for being so generous!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:19:28
Holding is not a problem. It just means that there are people who genuinely believe that the Bitcoins they hold are worth more than what the USD/BTC ratio suggests.
However, I think it's important to convert your fiat to bitcoins and make transactions with those bitcoins. Keeping this idea separate from the bitcoins you "hold / hoard".
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:24:45
I can verify that this is true. Japan is ignoring it. They might follow suit, but it'll be late in the game. 
My wife (who is Japanese) and I are trying to figure out how we can move to Japan and use bitcoins, so we talk about it a lot.

@_date: 2013-12-06 23:06:32
Bitcoin is not for the faint of heart..yet. 
You need to be willing to get your hands dirty in learning how the technology works. Otherwise, you might make mistakes like keeping an online wallet with 100BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:34
Why did you buy bitcoins in the first place? Ask yourself that question, and think real hard..
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:46:15

That's not true. It's BBQCoin.

Hm, good question. I haven't found much holding Americans back. Rather, I find it harder to get the older generation to accept it.

@_date: 2013-12-27 08:56:33
Personally, I want to see vending machines that accept Bitcoin. I know when I was in Japan, many things use RFID, so I'm sure that Bitcoin can be used as a payment method easily with that technology.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:01:25
This reminds me of when my parents told me I cant spend time on the computer because only "hackers" do that. 
It would be great for some parents to take the initiative and introduce kids to technology.

Also, they mention companies using Bitcoin (Overstock, Pink Cow, etc). They interviewed a few of them who basically said Bitcoin is cheaper to use than credit cards and carries less risk.

Sorry, but you're not going to find much out there. Consider selling a product for bitcoins and putting your location on coinmap.

Not even that, just call if trash.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:31:56

In all honesty, I really like this. As much as there are parts about the US government that I don't like, it's nice to know that they didn't just trash the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:01:59
Personally, I don't think we will have a "Steve Jobs" of Bitcoin, and I sure don't want one either. That's almost like asking for Bitcoin to be closed-source.

Bitcoin has a larger developer base, more adopters, bigger network effect, most market share.
An altcoin would need a significant technological achievement over Bitcoin for it to steal the momentum at this point.

If you are using Bitcoin-qt, this happened to me as well. I know that there are three factors.
1. Coin age (length of time those coins have existed in that wallet. The fee here is to prevent sending to yourself over and over again.)
2. Size is smaller than 10kb.
3. Transaction amount must be over 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:34:29

Disclaimer: I am incredibly and insanely bullish on this.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:56:11
I think it would have been easier if you had contacted support immediately after realizing you didn't have funds in your bank account. 
Panicking is a real good way to confuse them, and to make things harder on yourself.

Good for you. If you choose to invest, it's important to put in only what you're comfortable with. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:47:02
You don't have to convert to USD. What kind of business are you running? Is it possible to get materials or services you need for those bitcoins?

They can just make more XRP whenever they want. Sounds like fiat to me.

Well someone had to go there and find out.

Really? I get a fee if I send from Bitcoin-QT, even though I set it to zero.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:21:19
I would guess if we ever found some critical flaw in bitcoind that allowed for an attack, then the price might drop. 
But that would just cause us to rollback a revision.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:47:12
Are you absolutely sure you went to coinbase? I have heard of a lot of fake sites recently...
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:40:38
I would like to do this too, but I'd really like to buy a constant amount in USD with variable BTC, instead of the other way around.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:02:23
Don't worry. We're in the "network effect" stage.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:23:29
LOL. Just gonna throw this out there. I'm pretty sure Bitcoin-qt is not storing system time as a 32-bit signed integer. That mostly applies to stuff that doesn't have enough memory like embedded systems.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:30:03
Do NOT mine at Ghash.IO or BTC Guild. kthx.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:38:00
Wow. I bought one for $15 using Amazon's free $30 credit when you apply for a credit card :).
Just to let you know, I bought mine early in November, and I have made about at least $10 back.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:41:47
What? I didn't even down vote it. lol
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:07:41
It's okay, you're not the only person who has made mistakes like this. At least you were trying to secure your wallet right? There are many people who don't even put forth the effort.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:02:24

@_date: 2013-12-05 01:19:23
I think you have a valid point. At the same time, we should remember that as the market cap increases for Bitcoin, there is more incentive to make sure that the software is reliable. Since Bitcoin is open source, we can expect that ten years from now, many more developers will start contributing and there will be a lot more QA and testing involved.

Irrelevant. The real question is, why are people using Apple products to begin with?

I'm looking to buy a car using bitcoins too. This information would be extremely helpful
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:10:28
The fact that you can just go ahead and payoff someone's remaining balance is incredibly nifty. I like that about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:45:45
If you tell us some more information like how they gave you bitcoins, then we might be able to help you more.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:34:21
I have to sleep soon, so go for it! But this is a lot of fun :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:30:28
It's changing, just be patient.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:39:50
Might be worth it to contact coinbase support and explain the situation. I've heard they have good support.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:33:45
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:14:14
Unfortunately, I would get that confused with "million" so easily. We already do that with the metric system.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:16:40
I just bought another 1BTC. Everyone do your part!
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:30:54
Okay, if that's what you feel comfortable with why not? Even just having 1 bitcoin will be quite a lot if everything works out well.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:32:45
It will be interesting to see how the week goes. There isn't usually this much volume on the weekends..
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:12:01
I use Bitcoin-qt. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I don't like trusting Electrum servers..
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:37:51
I don't know what's profitable, but be careful. Do your research first, and don't just take any random person's word.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:59:59
Wow! You're right, they are still buying bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:15:31
I don't know too much about electrum. I'll look into it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:11:14
Well when you put it that way, then yes. I am probably going to sell some back to recover my initial investment. However, there is no way to know if bitcoin will take a sudden drop in value. The graph almost looks logarithmic.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:05:25
After I become a bitcoin millionaire and start a company, I'm totally going to ask people to come in on Saturday :D
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:16:11
I don't see the point, take Captchas for example, yes they are meant for humans, but computers are getting better at solving them. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:03:01
It wouldn't kill bitcoin transactions. But it would be difficult to trade USD / BTC
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:55:20
I like this.

BofA hasn't said anything to me yet. However, I've only been buying not selling.

I'll sell 1BTC when it gets to 6k. That covers my investment costs. Otherwise, I'm holding onto it until we get to the moon.

Also, apparently people who attack the Bitcoin network are females.

Aren't a majority of Quarkcoins pre-mined? I thought it was some crazy ratio like over 90%. That's obviously a pump and dump. Couldn't be more clear.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:19:07
How do you know a computer cannot "beat" it? I'll just make my computer solve them with a random time and close to the speed of humans. Then I still don't have to do any work.
Also, if you increase the difficulty, it may get too hard for human ability.

I saw a post today about one coming to Chicago. I'll try to find it.
They are expecting it to be in place around March.

I refer to it as "The Purge"
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:53:12
As far as I can tell yes. I follow coinmarketcap pretty closely, and they almost all follow close behind Bitcoin's rises and falls.
However, there are some coins that are pumped, and those don't follow the same trend. Those stand out though.

I'm not surprised. You put a USB slot on anything, and you're gonna have a bad time.

I think in 20 years, people won't be "selling off" bitcoins. They will be using them as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:25:10
Thanks for sharing. This is the first cold-storage theft that I have heard about so far.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:08:56
This is "Darkwings_08". Have you seen the posts from the guy?
All joking aside, I read the whitepaper, and from a CS perspective I get it. For me, that's basis enough to appreciate Bitcoin. However, for investors, you are probably right. Investors need to consider more aspects before putting a ton of money into it.

They absolutely need to require a password before sending funds. It's been mentioned multiple times. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:03:58
The ratio of people who would pay in altcoins is so insignificant, it isn't worth the time.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:08:39
Bitcoin has not "crashed" before so... yeah
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:34:25
Lets look on the bright side, it was 3-3. That's better than 0 right? Everything takes time.

Upvote this more. More people need to read this.

Please don't. Altcoins just hurt the movement by confusing people.

Would you consider doing a disk dump of your hard drive instead of sending your laptop? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:10:37
If you are serious, then what you should do is notify the Bitcoin developers. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:45:24
Mining is not really profitable. Unless you have super epic ASICs that no one has hands on yet. So, I'm guessing that people who buy contracts from miners get even a shorter stick.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:33:24
Bitcoin is already a huge success. There is no way it "cannot succeed" at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:32:33
I think they know this, and that's why they started the whitehat program. That's not going to prevent everything, but it can definitely help.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:34:43
It would be great if someone created a site / service for this purpose. Link merchants with suppliers.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:56:39
I dont understand how you can just be so careless with 5 whole Bitcoins! If you've got money to throw away, send some to me. 1AMBLH9Vfj3iob7BeoiCNhHbC9bnyvLY4u

I don't think it's as a big of a problem as you're making it out to be. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:26:18
Don't gamble :)
Mathematically, you will come out a loser.
Psychologically, greed steps in and messes up the way you think.
You might be the oddity that gets a million BTC, but usually those people can't stop gambling, and lose it back to the house due to odds.

For "Problem 1.", why is this an issue if we consider Moore's Law? Both Moore's law and the blockchain growth are exponential. In a year or two, we might all have newer hardware...(not everyone though)

But seriously, it would take something significantly better than Bitcoin to replace it. Not just changing the way a few things work.

Just give it up man. lol. No one even reads your posts anymore, they just read you name and think "Oh yeah, (click downvote)".

I hope I can get to that point.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:02:08
You can choose to treat it that way, but bitcoin is still not stock..
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:38:24
You don't need to say anything. They will realize the truth of the matter eventually.
