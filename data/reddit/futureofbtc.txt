Checked it out, not much content there. Bummer :(

 . Wasn't hard to find a article. There are numerous of them. People in China have rights just like you and me whether you believe it or not. Don't believe all the propaganda you hear on TV.

I was starting to worry abit. Glad you're good. Should've gave us an update tho! I been following your BTC adventures.

"high risk" is probably their excuse to cancel orders before a price hike. They seem like scammers to me. Use Bistamp next time and you won't have to gamble on a buy in when low, like with Coinbase.

Congrats on pulling out early. I'm sure in your mind you're the smart ass investor and that gives you rights to make fun of others who didn't pull out on time, yeah?

I didn't expect much but didn't expect this subreddit to become what it is. The popularity of bitcoins attracted the immature idiots who is probably bitter they never invested earlier and seeing red as other people striked big. 
Then again.. What did I expect from a bunch of immature kids with too much time on their hands. Keep your head up to the people who actually put in cash into btc. Hope it works out for all of us.

Doesn't seem safe giving someone your keys. Use caution people, I'm not trying to knock on this mans hustle, but it just isn't safe.

I'm actually impressed. But I do have to wonder why...

I'm wondering why isn't 12 day of bitcoin more popular than it is now. What happened to Mat Miller? I want to know!

Same, they said they would look into to it... but my hopes are low. I'm giving corgidad benefit of the doubt, seems to be trying... I appreciate it corgi.

The price is going back up.. I think now is a time when someone sells it'll get picked back up quick. Not like a few years ago when btc was still underground.. Keep your heads up people.

Don't use coinbase. Use a real exchange like bistamp. In the long run Coinbase will just give you unncesary headaches.

That is not true. The people decide if they want to accept their offer or not. Google houses in the middle of highways. They just build around or over them if they do not choose to leave. Don't spread bs.
