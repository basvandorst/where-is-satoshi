And you show earnestness how?  
Require a deposit from the claimant?  Great idea, now only people with excess funds can protect their bitcoins, or use their excess funds to tie up other peoples money possibly at opportunistic times.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:56:25
So require any holder of Bitcoin to publicly provide their identity and source of funds, that should go well.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:43:46

It will be a big difference because bitcoin will go away if they do that, it will crumble.

because they aren't printing more.  if you have 10 of something and are able to cut it into smaller pieces if you would like.  You still have 10 of that something, you can now just cut it into smaller pieces.

Because everything that you want to succeed is definitely directly tied to the history of the internet.  There is no chance it could end up like any other number of billions of things that weren't nearly as successful as the internet.

Selling now has nothing to do with it being the last time it'll ever be above 14k, it would be assuming it is about to go somewhere below 14k, and you can rebuy later for less.

He buys it on the fly to resell, doesn't have money to support his family after losing the 900.  But the only reason he won't sell the guy another 1500 is because he didn't want funds sent to him through gyft whatever.  You can't buy on the fly unless you have an access to some sort of funds.  So how can you not support your family all the sudden?

reading a dozen words on an object in your hand is a lot different than what we were talking about too, which was to get an app and verify the amount on the address and will take the time to use my app to verify that I made the coin.

@_date: 2014-02-10 00:16:07
it can't, if everyone holds then the coins will be worthless.  Most people are looking to hold on for a ride to the top so they can cash in.  There are some out there though that are really interested in bitcoin succeeding, but the majority just want their wallets to succeed.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:20:49
why bother using the coins if they have to go through the trouble of verifying balance on coin, and that you made the coin?  Seems like you could just bypass all of this and use a wallet on phone in first place.

If they are "too busy" to worry about bitcoin, aren't they "too busy" to "read the notice on the coin to verify the amount on the address and will take the time to use my app to verify that I made the coin"  Also a ledger that is non-blockchain tracked isn't worth anything without some other garauntees in place that it isn't being tampered with.

It is still bitcoin.  But they'll have no idea what it is they are using or how it works.  They'll have no idea that someone else had to know their private key at one point in time which means their bitcoins are much less safe than they should be.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:10:10
If all of these sidechains have fixed exchange rates, the 2 peg system.  Won't this limit growth in value of any altcoin that is heavily used..  As there will be some sidechains being heavily used and some not being used at all.  So in order for one to increase in value it would have to push up the value of bitcoin overall.  Which ends up increasing all other sidechains values whether they are useful or not.  This only seems to be benefiting bitcoin in the end.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:59:07
But if the exchange rate is fixed. What happens when one sidechain is being used for something that more people want in on and the supply runs out.  This limits the market cap on any other altcoin just for the same of bitcoin surviving as the top dog.

It's just a log of transactions though, and I'd imagine it would be hard to treat it any differently in a court.  Unless it were to start being regulated at some point, but that be going against bitcoins purpose to begin with.

don't they know the wallet containing those bitcoins?  Wouldn't be hard to check if they are still there.
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:53:35
we know that, and it can't. But way to keep up.

You do realize funds never go anywhere.  They are just records on the blockchain.   Which really makes me wonder if there are many laws in place to even cover this.

If it isn't something that is making them money they aren't going to be advising you towards it.  So asking for someone else doesn't seem like it will help.

The writer is also concerned about a meteor striking your pc while your bitcoins are contained in it.

So why bother with bitcoins then, if we end up in the same place as we are now with USD.

What stops anyone from just making a new type of digital currency.  Someone like facebook that already has a huge platform.  Where many more people will quickly learn of it/how to start mining/earning it.  Wouldn't that more than likely crash bitcoin?  Or if there were 20 new currencies tomorrow.
