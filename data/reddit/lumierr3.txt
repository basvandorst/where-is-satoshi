If you don't pay taxes, you better not be using public roads, public services and you should also pay back subsidies given to you which is mostly unnoticed in your electricity or water bill. Other people pay for that and if you plan on using them then pay up too.
A better way of not supporting what our government is doing so we don't sound like a hypocrite and a parasite to the taxpayers is simply placing our wealth or savings away from fiat and into Bitcoin or other commodities.

Perhaps they'd rather have a smooth growth as in a company rather than wild price valuations of bitcoins. If you look at the daily chart of the number of transactions processed in the Bitcoin network, it is much smoother and less volatile than the price. Therefore, Bitpay still profits fairly even if the price has crashed.

This is the future of Proof of Work - just a couple of ASIC manufacturers taking control of the network. Yes, there is no incentive to do a 51% attack but that doesn't mean nobody will try to do it. Don't forget that not everybody likes Bitcoin. The network will be in the hands of a few and we trust them not to fuck it up. We will also need to trust them that they sell their hardware to the public to preserve the consensus that bitcoin relies on. An attacker doesn't need to build their own hardware, they just need to seize already existing ones. It will only get worse in the future as mining becomes more centralized. They will become a point of failure for the whole network and you as a shareholder will have no voice or power.
Bitcoin is not exactly gold. Mining gold has nothing to do with verifying the validity of an ounce of gold. Even if gold mining completely gets fucked up, gold will still exist fine. Majority of my savings are in bitcoin so I care about the network and my holdings. However, Bitcoin fanboys are too naive realize the problem. Satoshi intended to use CPU power of millions of people around the world to get a consensus over the blockchain. If that consensus is left to a few, then it is no longer a distributed network but a centralized one.

I feel like Bitcoin companies today are targeting the wrong markets like the US, EU, or other 1st world countries. I mean at the moment, there is really no practical reason for these people to buy bitcoins than to speculate. Please focus on countries where Bitcoin is really needed like in high inflation countries (Argentina, Venezuela, etc.) or remittance markets (Philippines, India, Mexico, Africa, etc.). The main features of Bitcoin (Limited amt, cheap and instant transfer of value) is hardly taken seriously in 1st world countries.

I agree that nobody has a clue what will really happen. However, you cannot deny the fact that there is some trajectory of the price - a trend. Otherwise, if there is no such trajectory then the price of an asset would just go wildly from $1 to $10,000 in a day. Upon observation, prices move only within a certain range at a point in time - volatility. It would be crazy to predict a bitcoin to be $3 tomorrow morning. Therefore, if we combine the trajectory and price ranges at a given time, we can make a good guess on where the price might land in the future.

It's good that you don't invest in what you don't understand. However, if you are interested in exercising your freedom, enter Bitcoin. Because of how Bitcoin works, anything which has to do with ownership may be set in stone with the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, stocks, real estate, contracts, inheritance, etc.
Step 1 is to learn it.
I must warn you though, once you've understood it thoroughly, you cannot unlearn it and you will probably feel that the current bank controlled payment system and fiat currency is very inefficient.

What makes you think I don't understand how double spends work? Don't get me wrong. PoW is a viable solution to double spends but when you have these distributed miners working together and forming a pool, you introduce the network to a vulnerability of centralization. The miners might be honest but the mining pool operator may get compromised or become dishonest. That is what needs to be fixed.

I agree. Another misconception is that the stake holders do nothing to increase their holdings.

Besides the price they pay to participate in the economy from buying coins, they actually have to help the network to make use of their coins.

I understand that changes to the protocol are extremely political. However, you guys can do something without actually changing things right now. Just compile possible changes/modifications to PoW that at the very least make it hard to pool mine. No matter how realistic or unrealistic the change is, just compile so if when the time comes, we have a plan B. At the moment, this ghash issue looks pretty normal to you guys. When the bitcoin shareholders see you not showing concern, they get pretty upset. I believe you guys also understand that this begging to mining pools can't go on forever, or do you?

I think people overestimate the amount of people using Bitcoin in China. It looks as if much of trading volume is in China but you have to consider the 0% fees on many of Chinese exchanges. The bitcoins just go back and forth to the same buyers and sellers in those exchanges. With that said, it is totally not reasonable to compare volume between western/international and chinese exchanges.

I think Satoshi considered this outcome but he still intended to create a decentralized way of securing the blockchain. Why would he invent Proof of Work in the first place if he didn't want to decentralize the payment system? It is clear that his initial motive was to decentralize. And I imagine when he was developing a mechanism to get consensus for the blockchain, probably the most decentralized way of acquiring "votes" was the already wide spread CPU power of millions of people. Perhaps when he wrote that, there was no solution for the increasing centralization of nodes so he accepted the fact. He did not want centralization to happen otherwise he wouldn't have invented PoW but he didn't have a choice. But now, many alternatives which improve decentralization are being developed or have already been developed. I just think we must not ignore this and we should continue Satoshi's initial effort to decentralize.

We have an option to go Proof-of-Stake to preserve network security while having low transaction fees if something goes horribly wrong with Proof-of-Work. All thanks to those altcoin experiments. Perhaps in the future people will think of something even more innovative. At least for now, we have an option. However, a bigger question is if the Bitcoin community allows for the change. I believe that Bitcoin will become so large in the future that it would be extremely political and hard to change something in the protocol.

Good job OP. Best way to teach Bitcoin is to give them bitcoins. If they don't want it, then leave them alone. The more you try to convince them, the more arguments they make. Thus they become anti-Bitcoin. They will eventually regret ignoring Bitcoin when the price skyrockets and then they might try to learn about it. In the meantime, focus on those who are not against the idea of a decentralized currency. The open-minded people who make an effort to create a wallet and learn a little about Bitcoin are more deserving of your time.

I agree with the panel. It's naive to think that the current Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) is okay. Arguments like "Hey, mining centralization is fine. Look at gold. Only big companies do it." Bitcoin is not exactly gold in a sense that Bitcoin is reliant to the distribution of mining power in order for it to work.  Gold doesn't need mining in order to prove the validity of one ounce of gold. Mining is the lifeline of Bitcoin. If mining becomes more centralized, then the consensus that Bitcoin relies on will be destroyed. Imagine if there must be critical changes in the protocol where voting is required. How will we do it? The only thing I could think of is get the votes of miners. We will all be at the mercy of mining pools/ASIC manufacturers if nothing changes and bitcoin owners wouldn't have a voice.
The current PoW is like a ticking time bomb. There must be at least a back-up plan. I personally see some solution in Proof of Stake (PoS) but that is an unpopular opinion with some bitcoin fanatics perhaps because it is implemented in other competing altcoins. With PoS, we can secure the network sustainably and also give the bitcoin holders themselves a voice in the network.  Hopefully, there will be new ideas to come up but the main point is that we cannot let a few people control the fate of bitcoin.

Kicking Mark Karpeles and mtgox out of the Foundation will just cause more panic and perhaps drive the price down even more. A better way to deal with the situation is for the Bitcoin Foundation to formally request more information on what is happening at mtgox - request a technical explanation of their difficulties so the public could understand and maybe help. The public just wants to know why other exchanges like bitstamp and btc-e are up and mtgox still down. We just need clear and frequent updates! It looks as if mtgox just ran with the users' money from the poor communication.

Speaking of volatility, anytime somebody points out the volatility of bitcoin let's just tell them that the prices now are relatively more stable than prices back in 2010-2012. As more liquidity goes into the market, the volatility will decrease. Therefore we might expect it to stablize in the future just like gold's trillion dollar market of which price fluctuates less than a percent daily.

Ethereum might handle higher Transactions Per Second but if the Bitcoin experiment fails, that will also have a negative impact on Ethereum and blockchain technology in general. If Bitcoin succeeds, then Ethereum also succeeds. Let us not point fingers and let's try not to find someone to blame. Rather, we must look for a solution to the problem. Ethereum is like a sub-experiment to the main experiment Bitcoin.

Ethereum could have been a metacoin but Ethereum went to build an independent blockchain because of scalability. If we are to have an Internet of Things (IoT), each of the Things should not have to download 30 GB blockchain.
