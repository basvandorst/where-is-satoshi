Nice comeback
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:22:45
Does it need to,to lose money
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:47:20
Lol. I bought 7 coins at 79$ a peice and have done nothing to them. I love going back in all of your histories and looking at your comments. You are not doing so well yourself
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:09:14
My point is, that bitcoin will fail.
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:38:33
Blah blah blah. I know quite a few of you eyes open guys (easily shown to have bought heavily around 800-1200 and are losing your asses right now.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:27:51
So in this model, for instance let us say BTC hits 100k, is this weekly limit to prevent a sell off? and wouldn't that "scare" drop the prices of BTC dramatically? I'm a novice
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:07:21
Makes sense. By sell off I meant.... they would not have the funds to cash so many people out at once.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:38:47
then why not just put it all into gdax and skip coinbase? Again I am a complete novice
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:35:21
so let's say I DCA the 50k and go with a 10k per week with one exchange. do you think that is good? or would you say do 5/5 per week with two exchanges?
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:12:13
I do not plan on removing it at all for years and years, 20 at least if I am alive
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:24:29
Im hoping for the big picture. I am 35 and retired, but want to stay that way or I would invest wayyyyyy more.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:43:20
Sure. There are more popular books sold. Your logic suggests there should only be one kind of computer. One movie , one car. Come on bud.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:35:30
Sure let's keep you apples and oranges logic. Ok well let's rewind to the early 70's when they were taking off then apply you analogy. Two guys in a garage started apple man. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:00:26
I knew nothing of these. Hence the question.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:18:02
It is better now. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:39:14
So was Apple
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:22:26
It once did require you to win over the world. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:08:45
I am not talking about a store card type of thing sorry for the confusion. I am literally talking about a twin of bitcoin originating from someone with billions and could market it extensively while already having their own stash of coin, like millions of them.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:36:38
Computers and what they use are two separate things.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:12:17
Making a home computer seemed alien to the public and no one wanted them or felt a use for them. As they began to hit the market and the public began loving them it became much easier to market and sell. Bitcoin and all decentralized crypto currency is alien and scary to the majority of the world. As Bitcoin gains marketshare and popularity more people will begin to understand and accept it. Therefore it gets easier.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:19:22
Bitcoin is already around and expensive . Make a new one buy as many as possible while they are extremely cheap and spend millions on marketing and mega infrastructure. Then reap the benefits later.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:06:30
Jesus you are useless.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:32:58
So if I but 1million (insertnamehere)coins, at .01 cent per, I have spent 10,000$. Now spend 200 million on marketing and infrastructure. You have now spent 200,010,000$. Let's say it gets to 10,000 per coin. You now have 10 billion even if you never bought another coin. If you did the same thing with bitcoin right now at the end you would have about 2 billion.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:38:24
Does bitcoin have a phone? Was bitcoin able to get these things? Are you saying it a billionaire did not convince walmart to install virtual currency scanners in all stores (at his expense) and include his favorite coin as well as bitcoin and maybe another alt coin that it would not gain market traction?
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:50:01
Not a company already existing, sorry, I mean a new company of "programmers" that just decide to do the same thing and call it something else?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:15:27
Easy, a company say hey 7/11 owner I sell a machine much like a debit card scanner, but this uses multiple virtual coins, how ablut I install them in your stores for free and all I ask is that you always include this currency among the others you accept.
Then the maker of said scanners acquires as many of said currency as possible while they are worth absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:55:51
I would use different ways of accessing the internet sure. Multiplt companies already make their *own* intenet (search engines). Of course it's all the same internet but there are other ways to go about accessing it. The same way I am asking about accessing multiple cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:38:34
So everyone knows, I totally understand there would be pitfalls. I do not think you make one tomorrow and bang you are 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:02:42
Okay now let's say you are Bill Gates. You spend 100 million on a marketing campaign. You open source your currency and pay retailers to accept your new currency until it catches on. As popularity starts to skyrocket you are happy that at the start of it you gave yourself 1 million coins. Something like that.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:23:27
He is stating his opinion of bitcoin though there is no war against bitcoin. This guy doesn't spend his days devaluing butcoin lol.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:17:23
Who is underestimating Bitcoins? You seem ready to fight a war not yet waged.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:37:03
Good bye bud.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:53:40
When I say company, I meant cryptocurrency sorry for my ignorance in the matter. Also, yes it would be difficult to get people behind you sure, but after Bitcoin were to make it a more normal comfortable thing would it not be easier to copy? And how about making a cryptocurrency, giving yourself 1 million of them and market the new currency like crazy. Would this scenario not work?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:09:44
Who did you just compare Bitcoins popularity debate to that of the start of Ww2?
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:07:13
Again apples oranges. Not a lot of Microsoft computers out there kiddo.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:58:47
Not now of course hence the question. You seem extremely defensive, I am just pondering. I would think the more open and accepted bitcoin becomes the easier it makes it for competitors is you can call them that.
