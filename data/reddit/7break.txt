LOL you are talking about the amounts available. What you're failing to see is the completely unnatural appearance of the market that is supposed to be 10x bigger than any other in the world. If you can't see it, you simply don't understand my friend...

So as I understand it, he's spreading accurate FUD while pretending to be Chinese? You sir are an asshat. :-)

They change their rules every other week!

The order book is not fake. The purported volume is.

Sorry but this has no relevance. It does not explain how Huobi's shallow market produces volumes that dwarf the rest of the Bitcoin world.

Any of our Chinese friends care to translate this? It would be great if the people at Huobi realized that the we are not all complete muppets!

This is probably the most important point made by the OP but has been overlooked by pretty much everyone so far except you...
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:32:07
I'm also interested to know more about this. Perhaps OP can comment when he wakes up??
The guy's name is Leon Li - that's pretty much all we know.

A few things...
Look at the spread between the best prices. Huobi is relatively loose at 5111.01 / 5116 while BTC China is 5109.49 / 5109.5. This is certainly not what you would expect to see from an exchange that supposedly has 10x the volume.
Next, check out the lack of depth in the prices. You will see at any serious exchange - BTC China, MtGox, BTC-e etc. - many little orders. People jumping over each other 801.21, 801.229 etc. You will also see many nuisance little bids from bots. But somehow, the world's "biggest" exchange, 10x bigger than any other exchange, has very little market depth. And quite often you will see a ladder of round numbers.
The whole thing stinks. I think anyone who takes a close look at them will agree. They should just post the real numbers aka Okcoin and move on.

I think right now, there are a lot of people just buying and getting their coins the hell out of Huobi. This is keeping the price from totally falling through ... for now anyway. Tomorrow there will be utter chaos.

"This is actually good news"? LOL. Yes it's great news that the world's biggest exchange may be switching to accepting illegal funding via their business great account. Time for a triple face palm.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:55:04
You make it sound as though 0.4-1% daily interest is reasonable :-)
You are right about the other exchanges but Huobi is currently, massively the market leader.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:53:48
Semantics aside, the point is that Huobi's market does not look like its 10x bigger than any other exchange out there. It's "liquidity" if you would prefer to call it that, does not match it's purported volume.

Notice the complete lack of a normal looking order book? Little increments? Trap bets? Competiting parties? 
What you see on Huobi is completely incongruent with what one would expect from the world's leading exchange. 
It looks more like a Cavirtex order book (with a few larger bids) than it does a leading exchange.
