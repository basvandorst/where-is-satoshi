Women are indeed okay with admitting ignorance. It's the only way we can get by. To not know something is to admit defeat to a man that pretends to know it all.

I'm confused, if I, a 19 year old woman can fail and go bankrupt, why can't anyone else? They make too much profit for the government to let them crash? I don't understand. So I can crash and burn but the rich humans who even if they sold everything, could live COMFORTABLY until they die while taking care of their families. 
I can struggle because I have nothing to lose and have a networth of $50, but God forbid the wealthiest people who are ABLE to afford a struggle, actually struggle.

That's pretty cool but I feel like most people today wouldn't be on board. It would be a huge complicated change and people would have to do more work to find content

But when poor people do it it's so wrong. That's how the conservatives view it!! They are not your party! They are TRULY the party for them. You cannot have a rich person, that can't sympathize, or even empathize with the poor, for president. They don't care about you. Unless, you're rich and you can afford the lack of attention from the government. YALL can suck it up.

The tax payers are paying for it anyways so who's stealing from who? Say it loud.
