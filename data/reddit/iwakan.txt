Yes it can. Cryptocurrencies can do some things more efficiently than fiat, and even some things that fiat can't do at all. When you find a way to do something more efficiently, you have by definition created value, as you now have more time/money available to spend on other things because the previous task now cost less to perform.

Not really, like I said it could have been achieved any number of ways, or of course most likely a combination of them. Better functional architecture, better layout, lower voltage, more efficient manufacturing process even though the scale is the same, moving parts or all of the design from standard cell libraries to full custom with gate-level optimizations, etc. VLSI design is enormously complex, there is simply no way they are even close to the highest possible efficiency for mining chips after just a few years. Everywhere you look in a chip there are optimizations that could be made if you just have the time and money.

Semantics? It is not possible for average users to use segwit in the bitcoin core client. Even for advanced users it is very limited and clumsy. There is no semantics involved. By any rational standard, segwit is not supported. 
But don't take it from me. **The Core devs even say so themselves.** "Segwit wallet support" is a feature issue scheduled for version 0.16, which isn't released yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:16:47
No it's not. I use Core myself. There is no segwit functionality in the GUI, and even using the command line the support is crippled, f.ex createwitnessaddress requires you to re-backup your wallet or risk losing the private key, unlike regular address generation which bulk-generates and stores keys for the future.

Bitcoin is good at many things, such as stability and resilience as you mention. But it also has a lot of disadvantages, for example is it far less versatile compared to most of the general purpose blockchains that got a B rating. It simply lacks features.

No normal transaction with that kind of fee has confirmed since December 5th so that was just very good timing. 
Unfortunately, unless you are willing to pay a lot for a transaction accelerator, or you opted into Replace-By-Fee for your transaction, there is nothing to do but wait. No one know exactly when it will confirm. Best case scenario maybe within a week. Worse case scenario it will take several more months before the backlog clears.
You could try maybe abandoning the transaction in your client, then make another one with a bigger fee, but chances are the other nodes will reject it since it conflicts with your first transaction.

They are the outputs of the transaction. Whoever made the transaction sent 2.11021159 BTC to an address, and 20.08378528 BTC was the remainder which is sent to another address. Which means the total transaction amount was about 22.
You say in another comment that there was only 0.9949387 and the address never had that many coins in it. The reason the transaction still had enough in it to have an output of 22 BTC is that you were not the only input. I found out this by finding your transaction and inspecting it properly (it is not enough to censor the addresses, you can find the transaction by googling the BTC amounts visible).
There were a total of 32 inputs used in the same transaction, adding up to 22 BTC. You were only one of them.

Having zoomed out is exactly the reason why I think there is reason to worry. This past year looks just like the 2013 or 2011 bubble. Both of which ended up far lower than 50% of their ATH like bitcoin is now. I think we're in for a bear market and a price of $2000-4000 is far from out of the question within a year or two. Just like those other two bubbles.

If it actually is released in that time, it will still take a long time before the infrastructure is mature.

Of course I too agree that bitcoin, or more precisely cryptocurrency in general, is a good thing of course. But the point is that it can be even better, if it drops the energy expensive mining. It's not good because of PoW, it's good in spite of PoW. Is it so good that it's worth it even with PoW? Maybe, but climate change is such a serious problem that I am really unsure despite how important crypto has the potential to be.

It doesn't help if the scaling solution doesn't break bitcoin's robustness, if the scaling solution itself isn't robust. That's like saying nailing a garden chair to the roof of a car is a better solution than building a new car with one extra seat, because you get to keep the rest of the car which is already proven. Would you want to sit in that roof chair even if you trust the car below more than the other new car?
I'm not saying that's what lightning is, I'm saying we don't know yet because it isn't proven, so it's way too early to say it's over and the scaling problem is solved.

AFAIK it might get dropped after a long while (depends on each node), but you're free to republish it as many times as you want.
Basically if the transaction has never been confirmed, it's still your coins, so there's no need to "refund it". The problem with simply trying again is that 1) unless your wallet software lets you abandon the first transaction, it might not let you create a transaction with already "spent" coins. And 2) Even if you can, other nodes might not accept the new transaction because they still see the old, conflicting transaction in their mempool.

The lightning network is not bitcoin, it is a system built on top of bitcoin. There is new code, new protocols, new software, a whole slew of added complexity that is not proven. It is not true at all that everything the lightning network clients do is recognizing a valid signature or "sending". Lightning network doesn't just magically spawn infallible transaction signatures when sometimes decides to do a payment, there is complex code for parsing the transaction commands and previous history and generating the signatures, not to mention the other aspects such as routing. Any of which can be faulty.

If I send something to you on the lightning network it is easy to finalize it on the chain, **in theory**. I am saying that the system might contain vulnerabilities that f.ex prevent people from actually finalizing such transactions, even lose or have funds stolen, anything. The system hasn't been tested and scrutinized to the extent that bitcoin has, so you can't just as readily expect it to work as intended.

I have read several of those articles and responded in other posts already. You say that PoS is not new, but that detracts from your argument as you don't seem to be up to date on the tremendous amount of new research that have been made on it in just the last year and two. Most of your points are outdated, such as attack vectors like nothing at stake etc being all but solved. As for centralization of voting power, how is it any different than PoW? Currently just four pools control over 50% of the mining power, and at some points in history it has been close to just one pool controlling the majority. To do an attack on the network you just need to hack/kidnap one of these pool managers, as your example. Besides, it's not like if you have a lot of coins you automatically have a lot of power, you need to actually stake them first, and that requires locking up the funds for a long time, and an attack will most likely end up with you losing all those funds in the end as the network corrects itself. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:46:17
I am unconvinced. 
In essence, his entire article hinges on the claim that PoW is the only adequate consensus mechanism, yet I fail to see any good evidence for why that is the case. It is true that PoW works very well in securing bitcoin, however there are other up and coming mechanisms such as PoS that the article mentions but in my opinion fails to discount. PoS is not as simple and elegant as PoW, it can't be because it tries to avoid precisely what makes it simple: relying on consumption which is inherently hard to fake. But more and more of its shortcomings such as the nothing-at-stake problem is being addressed and we're nearing an implementation that is very sound and robust both from a technological and game-theory perspective. 
If a cryptocurrency can be properly secured in a different way that doesn't expend energy, such as PoS, then PoW is indeed wasteful. If two solutions that accomplish same thing, with one using a ton of energy, and the other using none, then the former is inefficient by definition. At one point he talks about how mining will get more and more efficient because of economic incentives, well in my mind the end-goal of that would be to scrap PoW altogether because that is the ultimate efficiency and thus economic incentive. 
He goes through a few points that can help with the efficiency of PoW such as its incentivisation to build out energy efficient plants by acting as arbitrage of power prices, but this can at most mitigate the waste, not eliminate it. He also talks about the far future when we have abundant clean energy via fusion plants etc, but this is frankly irrelevant, because the main point of trying to eliminate energy waste is to mitigate climate change, and that is *urgent*. In fact it's probably even too late, but we could probably at least avoid total extinction if we pull our act together pretty fast. And the bitcoin network is not helping with that.
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:23:36
I mean bitcoin's advantage over other decentralized currencies with low requirements for trust.
@_date: 2018-09-15 08:35:29
I don't see the problem, after having read this. He is saying that PoS and other mechanism are obscured PoW schemes. This is fine, as long as the obfuscation involves transforming the wasted work into something other than pure energy that contributes to climate change. He is talking strictly about economic efficiency, while I am talking efficiency in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, which is often in direct odds with efficiency in productivity/economy at all cost. He says that the waste in PoS is mainly lost liquidity, in other words being unable to take economic action. The waste in PoS is essentially equivalent to sitting still, twiddling thumbs, for a while. This is actually great for the environment. And the author even admits that he is not trying to argue against the environmental effects of either consensus mechanism. 
And precisely because PoS is an obscured form of PoW, it works pretty much just as well in terms of securing the network, as long as the problems introduced by the added complexity is accounted for.

Not until either popularity drops, or second layer infrastructure is mature. This could take a very long time. In the meantime you should use other crypto for smaller transfers, pretty much all of them are very cheap and fast compared to bitcoin.
Or if you mean just for that single transfer, there will probably be some windows some time with low fees that you can catch if you are lucky, might be in a day or two, might be weeks from now.

That is not true, in the DAO and other cases there was extensive discussion in the community and it only happened because of a clear majority consensus. And nothing stopped the few that disagreed from continuing their own fork: ETC. Vitalik does not have as much power as you make it seem. If he and only he wanted something, he would absolutely not get his way. 
And yes, Ethereum has relatively many hardforks to introduce new features, but that does not make a difference in the fact that that process is open and peer-review in the same way as with bitcoin.
But the bigger question is what does all that have to do with PoS vs PoW? It feels like you are trying to change the subject.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:50:09


No really, it only uses signed transactions to finalize when people add or withdraw funds from their lightning node. But the whole point is that they don't have to do that for every payment. And thus the majority of lightning payments will have no direct record on the chain that would make it benefit from bitcoin's security.

Yes, I remember his BitcoinStore which was the first and as of yet the only major store accepting only bitcoin. And this was back in 2012 when few people had heard of cryptocurrency, and he needed to sell for like half a million dollars per quarter in order to keep up his deal with the wholesaler. It was super risky and could not have been done by anyone who did not truly believe in the bitcoin cause.

I see, but do you disagree with what his point is though, that PoW also relies fundamentally on trust/centralization in the same way, except to a slightly less degree? And while that specific aspect might require more trust, PoS has other advantages in terms of decentralization, such as a reduced "economy of scale" effect in mining/staking enterprises, which naturally clusters mining horsepower into the hands of the few.

Your bitcoins are safe, but you need to rescan the whole blockchain to get the balance back. That's the point of zapwallettxes, it discards the data of the wallets you have been keeping track of, so you need to rebuild that data for the client to know how much bitcoin is in your wallet.

It's important to realize that these are very different statements. 
"Bitcoin not Blockchain" is essentially saying that Bitcoin is the only interesting blockchain project and others can be ignored, so that the word bitcoin is raised above the word blockchain, rather than being a subset of it. I completely disagree with this, plenty of other chains are very interesting and provides useful features that bitcoin doesn't, at least not nearly as well.
Antonopoulos on the other hand, is simply disagreeing with people saying the opposite extreme of Jimmy Song: That bitcoin is bad but blockchain tech in general is good. However disagreeing with a statement doesn't mean you agree with the opposite of that statement. Antonopoulos takes the middle ground, he believes that both bitcoin and other blockchain projects can have value. "Blockchain good, bitcoin bad" doesn't make sense as bitcoin is the strongest implementation of some of the core principles of blockchain tech. However "Bitcoin, not blockchain" doesn't make sense either as it dismisses all the other innovation in the blockchain field, even denying the existence of a "blockchain field" in the first place. I agree with Antonopoulos.

If by left wing you mean support a relatively high level of government involvement and welfare in public services like education, security, healthcare, etc, at the expense of high taxes, then I am left wing, simply because I think it leads to a vastly better and more fair society.
I still like crypto because 1. The pure tech allows for the creation or optimization of many services and products. Middlemen are expensive and slow and if they can be abolished where they can, it would increase the productivity of society, and 2. I am very against many victimless crime laws such as drug-, sex work-, and gambling prohibition, and cryptocurrencies makes it easier to bypass such laws to spend your money how you want.

Segwit doesn't really have anything to do with scaling. It's not an alternative to increased block sizes and it should IMO be implemented even if block size is increased. Segwit fixes a number of issues such as transaction malleability and make processing transactions more efficient. The reason it's being brought up in this debate is that the current segwit implementation also effectively doubles the number of transactions you can fit in a block by discounting segwit transactions, as a bonus. And also it makes it easier to make higher layer solutions such as the lightning network.
The hard fork increasing block sizes is all about scaling, however. It relies on brute force, if you can't fit any more transactions into a block, just make the block bigger. It has a few problems such as not being backwards compatible and being largely untested and unresearched for both long and short term effects.

It's decentralized, open, digital money. That means that anyone can use it and transfer money to anyone they want, without worrying about arbitrary limitations like borders or c€nsorship. It's also trustless, meaning that you don't have to trust any person or organization in order to handle your money. You and only you are in control. Nothing with these properties have ever existed before it.
That's if I only explain bitcoin, but in reality I wouldn't do that, instead I would explain cryptocurrencies and blockchains as a whole and mention various other coins and things they can do as well. I'm especially enthusiastic about the programmability in ethereum for example.

The coin is definitely not useless without him, just like bitcoin (evidently) isn't useless without satoshi. The reason many people listened to him (and the many other experts who argued for the same thing) is because he is extremely smart and wants the best for ethereum.
Vitalik and the foundations holdings combined is just 1.3% of the total supply (1.25M vs 90M market cap). For comparison, Satoshi's holdings when bitcoin was as old as ethereum is today was over 10%.
PoS will actually make the coin *less* centralized, as there is no economy of scale like there is with mining. Staking 100 coins with get you exactly 10 times as much returns as staking 10 coins. Like I showed above, the coins of vitalik and the foundation is negligible in comparison to what individual users like myself will stake, so in practice PoS won't give them more governance.

No. The drop in btc mining power is way too low to cause any damage.

No, I don't there is much that can be done in that scenario. Maybe a hard fork to decrease the difficulty effective immediately, or maybe we will just have to wait the weeks or months or years it would take for unprofitable charity mining to find enough blocks to reach the next difficulty period naturally. 
But I don't think the scenario is very likely. It would take a massive and super fast exodus of mining power that I don't think can really be caused simply by a short term more profitable mining alternative.

Bad chart. For one, wanting freedom from totaliarian governments isn't the only reason to use crypto. One other reason could be that crypto can do things that traditional payment systems simply can't, for example due to being programmable, or not requiring trust or being linked to an identity.

Except actual adoption. Still practically no one actually uses bitcoin for purchasing stuff, everyone is only using it to get rich quick. There are more major companies that are stopping their bitcoin acceptance than ones that start, citing complete lack of use. I had hoped that this would gradually improve over the years but it looks like adoption has hit a complete standstill for years now. And without this, all price movement is just foundationless speculation and has the potential to collapse far harder than it already has.

Completely disagree, more chains means more competition and choice which leads to better products, and also other chains can be used as a scaling method: If bitcoin blocks are full, just use litecoin or ethereum or whatever instead.
 In fact I think the future of blockchains are interchain connection protocols such as Polkadot or Cosmos. In the end it will hardly even matter what blockchain your transaction or information is recorded in, as you can access and use it seamlessly from higher level software like how we use the internet today without worrying what operating system the servers hosting the websites we visit use.

Look at this graph: 
At the end there near there top, you see a green band growing and not being confirmed. This is the 240-260 sat/byte band so it includes your transaction. So there you can see why it wasn't being confirmed. But now it is confirmed, because as you can see the green band has started to be cut into.

Well there are differences, for example it is much harder to misplace the gold as it's physical and more conspicuous than f.ex. a piece of paper if you print out private keys.
Secondly, if you do manage to lose it, it doesn't simply disappear, you could still find it later. But if you lose all copies of a private key, it is definitely gone forever.
That being said I don't really think gold should have the rating A+ either.

It was designed to keep transaction cost low with a transaction rate the same or higher than bitcoin.

In my experience the raw size of the pump isn't the correlation with the dump, it's the steepness of the pump. And this time around it hasn't really been all that steep. At most we've seen like 10% increases in a day, but mainly it has been steadily increasing for several months. 
This rally we've used about 8 months to rise around 10x. Compare that to the last big rally, when it took just over a single month for the same gains. That time, the price post-bubble plateaued at around half the peak (it slowly sank even more over the course of more than a year but if you wanted to cash out you would have done it earlier anyway).
There are many other factors of course, such as increased competiton from other cryptocurrencies, but I still think this time the crash will be less dramatic because of the less dramatic rise. Specifically I think it will plateau at around 0.7x-0.8x the peak. That means if the crash happened to start today, it would stabilize in a few months at about $6000-7000. It would maybe briefly go even lower than this though, before recovering.

The bitcoin cash fork was special because it had a massive drop of hashrate, which meant no transactions were confirming. And most exchanges required several confirmations before crediting deposits. This means that the supply didn't change right after the fork. People couldn't sell their coins for several days afterwards. And when they could sell, the price dropped massively, like I mentioned. In essence, even though the fork happened, what was on the exchanges was still merely futures for some time after.

I haven't checked the math but it sounds plausible. The mining network uses a *fuckload* of energy, and the number of transactions per second to show for it is relatively low.
It's a little better than it sounds though because due to the nature of mining that operates on thin margins, all the major mining centers tend to be located in areas with cheap electricity, and the cheapest electricity is almost always environmentally friendly such as hydro.
But yes, it's still not a good thing. Some say it's a necessary evil, but personally I think if proof of stake turns out to be viable, it is a much, much better alternative for society.

How is rich banks staking any worse than rich banks buying mining equipment? It's actually better, because with mining they get an advantage because mining expenses get lower the more you spend due to economy of scale. But with staking, 10 staking power is exactly 10 times as expensive as 1 staking power. Same with penalizing for transacting, you might as well say the same for bitcoin because anything you transact would be better spent buying mining equipment following that logic.

63 sat/byte is more than enough to make a transaction right now. Even 20 sat/byte is confirming. So there's nothing stopping you from spending that $10.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:01:16
You don't need to spend $4 in fees, you can choose whatever fee you want. The payment will just be slower. But you're right, for everyday use it has become unpractical. Blockchains still have a lot of advantages, if you want to benefit from them but still pay cheaply and quickly, you have two choices: Wait for second layer options on bitcoin to become available such as the lightning network, or use a different blockchain with higher capacity such as ethereum.

The definition of a bubble is rather subjective. It sounds like you think things can only be a bubble or not a bubble. I think something can behave like a bubble in isolated time periods, and I call those bubbles, regardless of whether the price recovers years after.

Ah yes sorry, English is not my first language and I mix them up sometimes. But I don't agree that that difference in mechanism for incentive for holding coins matter very much.

@_date: 2017-11-26 22:42:10

1) This time around there is much less consensus, both chains have support from a lot of people
2) Both chains want to become the true bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash did a clean break, changed the name (somewhat) and added replay protection meaning it is safe to spend coins on one of the chains without risking losing them on the other chain. But this fork has none of that, it will be a hot, confusing mess. People will say bitcoin and mean something else than other people saying bitcoin, and many will lose money from replay attacks.

IMO for a crypto asset to be worthwhile for investment it needs two things:
1. It needs to offer some unique utility that would make people want to buy it for other reasons than just investing.
2. It needs a robust and decentralized structure, because if it's centralized in governance or distribution then this probably invalidates its utility as the same thing could be done more efficiently and faster with a normal database-based program. What makes crypto useful is that it is permissionless and trustless, and centralized systems are by nature none of these.
To find out whether an asset meets these criteria, you need to do you own research. There's a lot of misinformation going around, so be skeptical. Reading the whitepaper is usually the best way, even if it is long and technical.

Bingo. Short term swings are indeed practically random. It cannot be tied to specific events.
Long term movement is very logical though. It's based on hype cycles and every one of them has almost been identical to the last, only scaled vertically or horizontally a bit.

I have also been through bitcoin during all the crashes OP mentioned, first bought when they were $1 a piece. Yet I have a very different view. Buying now is not a good idea. Even if you believe bitcoin will continue to rise in the long term, which is admittedly far from unlikely, we are likely entering a bear market for quite some time. After all crashes that resembled this one, namely the ones in 2011 and 2013, we have hit lows of at least 20% of ATH, which would be around $4000 this time around, and it can easily go even lower than that.
And that is assuming the long term upward trend continue, which there is no guarantee for. It is very possible that this was actually the highest bitcoin will ever go. At some point the growth will stop, that's certain. Whoever claims to know the true, fair valuation of bitcoin, both now and in the future, is lying. No one knows for sure what will happen.

It would depend on people being moral enough to report their income correctly themselves. I am frankly doubtful that a large enough percentage of the population is that honest, in which case the governments would likely not allow it because it could lead to the collapse of the national budget. They would crack down on privacy and either make completely private money illegal altogether, or require all substantial flows of money such as wages or big purchases like real estate to go through approved, non-private channels.

That wasn't what I was trying to say at all. I apologize if it came across that way.


But this simply isn't true. The best *do* only beat the market by only a little bit. Again, I'm talking over long periods of time.
Take for example Toby Crabel. He's a well-known veteran trader. He has managed an average annual return of 16.91% since 1992: 
Compare that to the S&amp;P index for the same period with an average annual return of 7.6%. He's over twice as good. Which is phenomenal for a 25 year period, but far from hundreds or thousands of percents higher like you say.
According to the study mentioned on this page, the majority of day traders lose money when accounting for transaction costs, and only about 1% could be called predictably profitable:

The problem is that it doesn't work to just say "one wouldn't need to pay so much if everyone agreed to just lower their fees simultaneously". That's not the Nash equilibrium. The 600 sat fee transactions aren't competing against the 5 sat fee txs, they are competing with other top-tier fee txs. As long as there are some people paying high fees, others will naturally also have to pay even higher fees, and then the first guys have to pay even higher fees. Even if the same end result could be had for far less fees in theory. This is unavoidable without setting arbitrary restrictions like forcing people to pay low fees, but that would go against the free market principles that bitcoin stands for.

Because they aren't guaranteed to confirm in the same block. If there is a slight bump in traffic or if a block takes a bit longer to be found, suddenly you have a block where the 600 sat transaction confirms but the 5 sat or even higher, doesn't.

Your post is pretty misleading. It clearly says that there is a cap of 18 million eth issued per year. PoS can change the exact rate for technical reasons but it won't exceed that. And that is not any inherently worse than bitcoin's issuance system. What's important is that the inflation is low and predictable, not that it necessarily goes to exactly zero eventually. In fact, it's very possible that ethereum will end up having a negative inflation, making it even more scarce than bitcoin.

Ah yes I think I get it. That mysterious transaction was only for 0.0389 BTC (the Golem purchase), however due to the way bitcoin works, it took the whole balance, and sent the remainder to a different address, also controlled by exodus, as change. However it seems when you exported the wallet from exodus, you didn't export this change address as well, only the original address.

The difficulty will adjust so bitcoin will work with any amount of mining (it will just be somewhat less secure).

If you'd look back to my first post, I said "Even the few legendary traders that beat the market consistently and over a long period of time, only do so by **single-digit percentage points**."

Some of the biggest signs that something is a pyramid scheme is if people insist that it isn't a pyramid scheme. If someone says it sounds like it, just say something like "I guess it might seem that way", and casually continue the conversation.

We're talking about trading swings, this is very speculative in almost every case and extremely few people have the skill to consistently get it right. We're *not* talking about proper investing like active funding of companies. That is an entirely different field.
And even if we did talk about the same thing, I never said anything is a "net loss". I only said it's extremely hard to beat the market. But the market is generally speaking rising. Which means that a daytrader can earn money but still lose to the market, he only have to earn *less* money than he would if he owned assets and did nothing with them.


I specifically said "consistently and over a long period of time" so that you wouldn't bring up single cases like this, but I guess that was a wasted effort.

Maybe it is technically possible to build some of those things on bitcoin, I don't know, but it's far more complicated and restricted for sure. Ethereum has a virtual machine that can run traditional computing operations written in a dedicated smart contract language. Bitcoin wasn't made for smart contracts, it was made for simple transactions. It has gained a few more opcodes recently to do more fancy stuff, but it's still very limited compared to the ethereum virtual machine's capabilities.
If anything, I'd compare it to writing a computer program directly in assembly rather than through a programming language. There's a reason 99.9+% of programs use the latter, just like 99% of current dapp developers have chosen ethereum or another smart contract focused blockchain, rather than bitcoin. It's just far more practical.

Graphic cards are useless for bitcoin mining, you need specialized hardware. You can mine altcoins, but the most prominent ones like ethereum is moving to proof of stake eventually. And for the rest, difficulty will skyrocket as the miners of the soon-to-be PoS coins shift over to them instead. Either that or they sell their mining hardware which would bring prices of graphic cards down. Either way it will lead to fewer sales for AMD.

They would make around 20 CAD a day in revenue at this point, not $25. And that's excluding electricity. And the difficulty is increasing all the time. In six months the number may very well have dropped to $10 or even lower. 
Maybe you will make a profit, maybe not. No one here has a magic crystal ball so we can't say for sure. But if you do make a profit, it won't be anywhere near $130 000 (unless bitcoin keep rising to offset the difficulty increase, but in that case you'd simply make more by just holding bitcoins).

The blockchain (transaction history) of bitcoin will split into two, 2x being one of them. This hasn't happened yet. If you own bitcoins at the time of the split, you will own coins on both of the chains because they were identical before the split. But after the split they are separate, so if you buy or use one or the other then, the other one will not be affected (in theory, there are some issues with so-called replay techniques but you don't really have to worry about that if you intent to only use one of the chains).

Slapping on a side chain for smart contracts on a system designed for currency purposes only will never be able to beat a system designed for smart contracts from the ground up.


No, for two reasons: 1) Many coins aren't comparable and serves different purposes, and 2) Even if they weren't, I believe it is far more efficient and logical for the future to be a network of several blockchains, each suited for their own specialty, able to offload each other and prevent a single point (blockchain) of failure, and able to communicate with each other.


Yes, there are dozens of dapps either working or with proof of concept including decentralized exchanges, VPNs, cloud storage, cloud computing, advertising platforms, gambling platforms and decentralized marketplaces. And the list of other applications in the research or development stage is an order of magnitude longer.

It could enable trustless licensing, for example by making the payment for the software itself the license. If you send a certain sum to a certain address, you can use that txid as your key to the software. It has a few problems, or rather unsolved issues though. For example, it would require the software to be a cryptocurrency node, which usually entails a lot of unwanted processing and storage requirements for just a simple thing like licensing. Also it doesn't inherently allow the software owner to manually add or deactivate licenses, but maybe some would see that as a plus instead. So it's interesting, but not very practical yet, needs research and problem solving.

It is objectively more fair as there is no economy of scale incentivising large scale operations that brought us where we are today.

The fact that so many people seem to have trouble understanding why bitcoin is worth what it is, is pretty worrying.

If so many people don't understand how bitcoin is valued, does that mean that all those people also don't understand basic economy?

No, the price of a bitcoin is not correlated with the price of transaction fees. In theory. But in reality the fee price has tended to stay mostly the same in BTC terms, not dollar terms. And if so it's opposite of what you say, if BTC goes to $60k then it would cost $20 instead of $2 to send if the fee stays the same measured in BTC.

It's even arguably beating bitcoin at its own game; payments, with a consistently higher number of transactions per day recently. And you need to remember that ethereum is only like two years old, you can't expect all its content to be ready already. The list of projects in development are orders of magnitude longer than the ones who are ready.

Maybe games on steam. Unfortunately they use bitpay which adds like 70 cents at least to the sum for their own internal transaction fees, even if you make the payment at a time when the mempool is empty, so there will be some overhead. But you should still be able to afford the games that cost like $1-2, of which there are a few, especially during sales.
Another option is cheap asian sites that has many items for only a dollar or two and with free worldwide shipping. For example

I bought at $220 because of the potential. But it's easy to see that bitcoin is hugely overvalued right now and would drop. Or rather, it was even easy to see that back at Christmas, which is why I sold then.
I still believe crypto has a bright future. But if you offer me free money, I will take it.

Do you not see how this sounds obnoxious and arrogant? You don't have to "hate BTC so much" to frown when seeing something like that. I'm sure if you just posted the video of Andreas with a normal title, such as the unedited title of the video itself, you'd get a much better response. And in fact, it does (which also makes your post a repost after just 16 hours:  )

How so? To my perspective it isn't any more centralized in governance than bitcoin. The DAO hack rewind wasn't decided by some single entity, it happened because it was the vast majority decision, exactly how decentralized governance is supposed to work.

If satoshi abandoned bitcoin in the early days before others took notice, it would have died too. 
Decentralization is a feature of design, not community. And since Bitcoin cash has the same design as bitcoin (because it's forked off the same code), then if bitcoin is decentralized then so is bitcoin cash.

I first heard of it in 2011. I was quite sure that it, or a similar system, would have a future, but I didn't think it would be this big, this fast. Or rather I didn't think the price would be this high. Looking back I had expected more actual adoption before the price reached the levels of today. Either that or it would fade into obscurity. So basically I believed in it but not enough to make big investments. I only bought $20 worth or so (still got me 25 bitcoin at the time, but I spent them all during the first bubble).

Sadly in my country (Norway) almost no shops accept bitcoin. I know about one apple product repair shop, a couple of cafes or something in different cities than mine, and a few small niche stores. No stores that I would be interested in. But I've been doing my part, I actually sell some products myself and have been accepting crypto since 2012, but my shop too is very niche and more internationally focused.

Thing is, it's not really "on the low" even now. When compared to three months ago, sure. But remember a year ago it was $1000. If we've been that low so recently, it's not really a stretch for it to go that low again.

Not true at all, it most definitely is a decentralized and distributed computing platform. The efficiency is beside the point because it does enable a lot of use cases that *cannot* be done with traditional peer to peer, because ethereum is trustless, traditional peer to peer is not. The exact same reason that makes bitcoin different from other attempts at peer to peer money. And it's not a solution searching for a problem, it has already found several problems it solves.

Probably more like the fact that people who don't think bitcoin will make it won't be dedicated enough to bitcoin to make a whole channel about it, even if it is against it. They just won't care enough.

A bit strange that you don't include any questions on how much we've sold etc. For example in the question "Is your current cryptocurrency portfolio worth more than your initial investment?", if you vote no there is no way to know whether that is because its value has decreased or because you've sold a bunch. For example I voted no because I sold, even though the value had increased over ten thousand percent when I did.

First of all, that's not true, the early and late 2013 bubbles were $260 and $1160 respectively but in 2015 it dipped to $152 at one point and was stable around $200 many other times after. 
Secondly, past performance does not imply future performance.

The presale was a different strategy for initial coin distribution than bitcoin did, but it does not necessarily make it less fair. Anyone could participate, just like anyone could choose to mine bitcoin, and so in theory there's no reason this should lead to more centralization of coins than with bitcoin. And it had several advantages, such as kickstarting the economy by causing the coins to immediately be valuable because they were bought with fiat value, and securing development funds. 
In the start, bitcoin value was also heavily clustered. Miners got more bitcoin per block, and there were way fewer of them. When bitcoin was as old as ethereum is today, Satoshi alone was estimated to own over 20% of all coins in existence. And the rest was also owned by a relatively small amount of initial investors, just like you say about etherum. When ethereum gets as much time as bitcoin have had, the coins will have been spread just as fairly.
