Very simple, where does fiat money to buy into that supercomputing network come from?

This article is linkbait to fit the narrative that cryptos will inevitably end the establishment banking system.  The banks are not threatened at all by crypto.    They have been quietly investing and experimenting in blockchain tech for years on incremental improvements to the existing system (trade clearing, interbank/cross border xfer, etc). As for the BTC/alts universe, they are waiting and watching to see if and when it becomes an investable asset. That has begun with smaller institutional investor interest, and it will build steam when regulation and maturity of the markets takes place. BTC is still a new asset class and the lack of regulations limits what banks can be involved in. Furthermore , they make enough money in mature asset classes and far deeper markets that BTC is still a small sideshow (even at it's market cap peak). Given that BTC etc are still valuated in fiat terms,  the day that regulation is clear and institutional  investors/trader interest exists,  they will get involved in a very meaningful way. Early adopters will make money for sure, and you can bet the banks will too.
TLDR, the banks are not threatened by BTC at all, because when it becomes a viable opportunity they will take advantage of it and still make money.
