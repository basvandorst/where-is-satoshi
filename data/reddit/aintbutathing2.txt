Sweet, now I'm excited to read it.

Exactly and that's just not cool. Damaging someones karma because you are greedy for 20 cents, shame.

Thank you for sharing. You can sit back down now.

This was not the often discussed bearwhale often debated on bitcoinmarkets. This event was a seller with limited market experience making a panicky exit. First he accidentally crashed the price to 275 then upon realizing he couldn't exit with market orders while maintaining a price backed off to figure out how to get rid of the coins. Came back an hour later and tried to sell for 320 this had the effect of capping the price and ensuring it never reached that wall. After observing this he then dropped the wall to 300 and the drama unfolded. 
This looks like a panicky uneducated exit rather than the subtle long term strategy exhibited by the oft discussed bearwhale.

I thought good news made the price drop and bad news was actually good news.

Yes it is entirely possible that I am completely wrong on this however I believe my hypothesis based on the events we have seen still seems a reasonable fit to the events that occurred.  You are absolutely right though in that my conclusions are pure speculation.

blockchain.info has an api that could simplify the monitoring, it uses a callback: 
edit: Looks like it takes care of the whole package.

Wouldn't they just pay the vendors with their investment money?

So it will be up to the band to book appropriate sized venues to keep prices appropriate to their demographic.

No. You are awesome.

I believe there are some others who have tried to look into the address where it is suspected the coins came from. One view put forth was this was an investor from 2012. I think simply stating that it was an early adopter who panicked, broad as it is, fits the picture best.

I thought OK Coin didn't use cold storage and opted for a blockchain wallet instead.

Can you simply donate my tip to the charity of your choice rather than tipping me? Thanks!

Yes it would be irreversible. The value per bitcoin would become 0.

Google does not pay to bypass paywalls. If you have something behind a paywall you want it listed so when Google comes knocking you open the gates.

People do not like to sell crypto using paypal as the crypto transaction cannot be reversed but the paypal one can. So if you do find a site that does there will be a heavy markup.

It just occurred to me that pure bitcoin based vending machines offer several advantages over cash based machines.

It's too hard to mine coins on testnet and the faucets are stingy other than that it serves its purpose.
