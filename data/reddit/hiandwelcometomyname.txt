Well, thats a good idea didn't even think of that: 1h4QKEA9w19Ydk71TLhNDTbvte7E7N8n8
Nobody should feel obligated to send something, but it would definitely help :)

Yes,  that's reasonable. To be transparent: the 7euro just spend were the 2 drinks you guys gave me,  thanks again ! 
The room is payed tomorrow: 40€

Thank you so much :D
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:44:10
Thank you :) 
Yeah i know its not that much,  but i need a place to sleep,  not a hotel. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:21:41

I will save it,  maybe i have then enough for the room. 
Edit: you gave it to me for a beer,  so i deliver ;)

Wouldn't be helpful if he doesn't have a backup anyway.
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:29:00
Cashout would be great, but only if i dont find something till 20 o'clock,  i reLly want to see if i can get room with btc :) 
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:55:41
Yes still searching for tomorrow, my bus home drives Friday.. 
Do you have something to sleep? Id be really glad :) 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:03:06

Finally I found some nice guy in Lichtenberg who exchanged with me. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:04:15
Just checked that.  I found a good room, but no bitcoin.. 
Really need something. My battery is almost empty
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:20:10
Thank you for that hint. I will look into it. By the way, it doesn't have to be a hostel or single room either. A good place to sleep is enough.
