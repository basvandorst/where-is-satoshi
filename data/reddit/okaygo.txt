I had asked if there was any interest and there seemed to be, this is my result after a few days of work. Feel free to give it a try if you've got some spare coins to help me make my first! Go Bitcoin!

You guys asked for it, I deliver; 
I am assuming liability for Bitcoins. Help me make my first coins :)

1 BTC for s/h, yes. This isn't per item, it's all together.

The work will be handled by a local printing lab, once uploaded your work is ready for the lab to handle. I just need to confirm the payment on the block chain. Our local lab is meant for professional photographers and is staffed and has the equipment to handle many more needs than what I currently offer on the site. As it stands now, we will print your pictures as uploaded on 'Borderless prints on Fuji “Lustre”' surface paper'. It's high quality paper for sure, you could frame this stuff, or use it in your scrap book. Your prints will be done in a reasonable time and mailed via postal service by me.

Yes everything is up on the table at the moment. The prices may lower in the future across the board and there could possibly be discounts for bulk orders. I don't actually own any Bitcoins so I accept a lot of risk by trying to do this for the business. Thanks for understanding and being interested.
Edit: I've lowered the price of S&amp;H to 0.50 BTC
Has to be at least .50 BTC for the time being.
