Doesn't need to scale to visa levels necessarily, but needs to be bigger than it is. We also need sidechains, segwit, lightning, and other ways to help Bitcoin achieve its potential, which is to be magic Internet money.

Quite the reverse. HODLers are those investing in the first killer app of Bitcoin, which is as a speculative asset. The developers are usually also HODLers and thus working to maximizing their own investment while also bringing the disruption of Bitcoin to the world. HODLers are also not usually silent. Though they may keep their wealth in paper wallets, they also are usually out there talking to people, pointing out the flaws in the current system, and recommending Bitcoin, even if in only small amounts, to people coming to the realization that things are not going to work out for them in the current system.

Bitcoin will continue to fail, and succeed, until the market cap is high enough that 1,000 dollar swings in price don't matter and the infrastructure is built out enough so people CAN buy that cup of coffee directly with Bitcoin.
Greed is what is building the capital. Developers on many fronts are building the infrastructure. We aren't there yet, and it is a slow, painful process. 
It's also a necessary one to free money from the control of governments and oligarchs.

Strongly disagree. Fees are a bug so high that they inhibit usability are a bug, not a feature. I don't have a dog in the fight about on or off chain scaling, but scaling needs to occur if Bitcoin is going to be anything more than a curiosity. If things continue as they are now, Bitcoin will fail.

Hoy!  Thanks again for the link. I'm trying to get this going, and perhaps you can point me to a resource or person who can help me get over the humps. 
I am able to get everything going well, until I hit this point: 
./contrib/install_db4.sh $(pwd)
The command installs and I get a long readout, but a the bottom, it tells me that tar: db-4-8-30.NC/txn: Cannot utime: Operation not permitted
After this there are a few more errors associated with the same db-4.8.30, specifically saying that it doesn't get read write status.
Then when I try to use the next command, ./autogen.sh, I get a number of errors telling me that LIBTOOL is undefined and a few others.
Any help you can provide would be appreciated!
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:39:27
Ah. I was looking around and found a note about a similar problem. I did these two things, and now the ./autogen.sh is building.

"socialists." I'm noting a troll meme going around. Plutocracies, corporatocracies, etc. all work to funnel money into their own pockets at the expense of everyone else.
Socialism itself merely means people chip in for things that make everyone's lives better. Yes there can be and have been abuses, but the severe lurch we're going through toward corporate control of the world strikes me as far more terrifying as there will be no effective way to fight back outside of a French style revolution.

Got a call the other day from the IRS telling me that I was being investigated for fraud and faced penalties and possible jail time. The call went to voice mail, so this was left as a message. The person gave a number once and told me to call as IRS agents were 'standing by.'
Because of my involvement in BTC and the grey area around its tax implications, I panicked for about 13 seconds before calming down and saying 'What?' The IRS would send a letter. They would never leave a voice mail and never call back. I know they cashed my tax check because I'm one of the people who actually report their crypto transactions. ETC.
A proper blackmailer would tease you with information to let you know they had something real.

It's interesting that you say that we have lots of ways to buy things already. The purpose of Bitcoin is not to give people another way to buy, but to give them a way to control their own wealth without asking the permission of a bank, a credit card company, or even a government. 
I expect that banks, payment processors, and governments will continue to thrive in a post BTC adoption world, but I expect their power over us to be somewhat limited. People will have options.
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:02:44
Wow, reading this thread is amazing! 
To leave aside the snarkiness and non-answers, I think all of us working in the Bitcoin space hope that Bitcoin will succeed to the point where it be difficult for a person to save or earn enough to have one Bitcoin.
Whether that will happen, I don't know. Wences Casares, the founder of Xapo thinks it has a 50 or 51 percent chance of going to a million, 20 percent of going to nothing, and thirty percent of going somewhere in between.
My own opinion is that it has great potential, but Bitcoin still has developmental hurdles it has to overcome to really hit big.

True. Governments would have to be careful to live within their means as they couldn't just print themselves out of the their debt. Households would be encouraged to save an spend what they need rather than putting themselves into debt. The point is, we need a fundamental change in the way things are now.

I wasn't caught in a sting since I have a banner on my site announcing that I am part of a PR ring and my Guest and Sponsored Post page clearly states that I do allow sponsored articles. To get caught in a sting, I think I should have been caught hiding something. 
I never got an email from Tom, but if I had been 'stung', my reply would have included that all sponsored posts are clearly marked as such and also that I retain full editorial control, including the final say about whether a piece gets run. I don't knowingly promote scams even for money.
One of my problems with the way Tom handled this is that he never reached out to me. After I found the article, I tweeted him since I couldn't easily find an email address, and he never responded though he was responding to others.

Thanks for reading. I'm really curious what points you thought were so far off. You said there were too many to deal with, so which do you think are the most important?
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:13:02
Dear Tom,
First I want to thank you for taking the time to respond to this post. Immediately after seeing the article in which you attack bitcoin news sites that accept sponsored posts, I tweeted to you that it was my policy to mark sponsored posts, but you did not respond to me at that point, though you were responding to others. I would have emailed you, but I could not readily find an email address for you anywhere.
To the heart of the matter, I agree that there is a discussion that could be had about the role sponsored posts play in journalism. They are fairly common in all sorts of media, and to be sure, the better sites will be sure to mark them out as advertising or paid articles. It’s my hope that one day BitcoinWarrior will grow enough so that I can support it purely with the traffic I drive, but I’m not there yet. On that level, I was really pleased to see the article since it gave me an opportunity to think about these things. 
A few other parts of the article bothered me, though. To write a piece attacking others in the Bitcoin news space, you would have to be a consummate professional and a model for the rest of us. Just not feeling it.
Since in another comment someone mentioned that you ran a ‘sting’ operation, I should note that I cannot find any evidence that you ever contacted me. I have gotten emails asking for sponsored posts, but none that match the names and format of the one you included in your article. So, I don’t believe I was caught in a ‘sting.’
And, you would hardly have had to ‘catch’ me. I am a member of a ring of sites that post press releases. There is an ad on my site for the ring that includes the logo for my site. There is also a Guest and Sponsored Post page on my site that clearly states that I’ll do paid posting. If I had gotten caught up in your ‘sting,’ the return email would have stated clearly that I retain final word about whether to post the article or not – I will not promote sites that are clearly scammy – and with a note that the post will be marked as sponsored. 
Sponsored posts are a form of advertising. They are common practice, though when abused they are certainly a cause for concern. Painting a whole set of websites as untrustworthy because of this practice is painting with a pretty big brush and smacks of irresponsible journalism. That being said, I am no journalist. I am an amateur both in Bitcoin and in running news site. If you had visited my ‘About Me’ page, you would have seen that I say so there. I am learning my trade, and I feel I am getting better at it.
One of the most important things I bring to my site is a respect and courtesy for the other people that I deal with. If I need to expose a scam – which I have done – I reach out to those people first and see if they can justify themselves. If they can’t then I run the piece. But even in that piece I will avoid ad hominem attacks and vitriol. 
Tom, you called my website untrustworthy without contacting me or, as far as I can tell, even visiting it. When I reached out to you, you didn’t respond. And, when I posted here, you come back with vitriol. From what I can see, you may well have more journalistic training than I, but my statement above still stands. You are a self-aggrandizer using controversy and click bait to promote yourself in the community. 
If you’d like to have an honest discussion about sponsored posts, I’d welcome it. Be in touch.
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:51:50

@_date: 2014-09-16 23:13:02
Thanks for taking the time to comment. I think I understand your concerns a little better now. 
You're right that there are a lot of challenges to Bitcoin - including learning curve, the challenge of converting to fiat, etc. I deal with these extensively in my other writings, and will continue to do so. 
If I had to say myself what I skipped, it would be scalability and the rising centralization of mining. Volatility and merchant adoption are not problems from my perspective since those things are merely part of the growing pains of Bitcoin. 
I do think it's useful, though, to compare BTC to CC. People are right now using CC as Internet cash --  a dangerous thing to do even with transaction insurance given the rising household debt rates.

As far as I can tell, this guy is using click-bait articles with overblown accusations to aggrandize himself. I first ran across him when he accused my blog for running sponsored posts. We do. We have an information page about it.  All of the sponsored posts are clearly marked at the top of the articles as paid for. And sponsored posts do not affect content anywhere else on the site. I felt his attacks were hyperbole and best to be ignored.
Two Bit Idiot made some credible accusations against the foundation last year and got some well-deserved attention to his blog because of it. With this article, this guy is trying to rip off Two Bit's play.

Bitcoin Warrior's ethos is to do well by doing good. We sell ad space and sponsored articles. Our ad space is currently being managed by Coin Telegraph, but they have no editorial control, or say. We currently have a GAW miners ad running as that ad is running on the Coin Telegraph network. Sponsored ads are clearly marked as such.

This is just my two cents, and it's worth about that, but in my opinion, BTC is still in its 'commodity' phase. It's real usefulness as a currency won't kick in until it hits a sufficient market cap, which will need to be 500 billion or a trillion. Being in the 'one in a million' club would be enough to be life-changing, then.
A number of people here don't seem to think that the price of BTC is going to accrue that much. They may be right. But, from what I can see, there's a hollowing out of the world financial system right now due to TBTF, QE, ZIRP and any of a number of other things going on that benefit the already rich at the expense of everybody else. The problem is that things like this don't last, and when they crash, everyone suffers.
That's what happened in 2008 and is likely to happen again. the difference is that this time we'll have bitcoin to fall back on.

RSCoin shows that people in power are watching, are appreciative of Bitcoin's advantageous, and are looking to appropriate it for their own ends. They want to use digital cash to kill physical cash and take complete supervisory control of people's finances. RSCoin is real 1984 shit. 
In one way, it's great that a central bank is validating the idea behind Bitcoin. It's fair that their idea is totally contrary to the reason for Bitcoin to exist. And it's a wake up call for us as a community to pull our heads out of our asses, cut the name calling, and get down to the hard work of scaling and decentralization.

There's something to be said for ramping up capacity in a slow and smart way. There's something to be said for developing upper layers, some possibly centralized, to handle greater capacity - including payment companies, sidechains, and lightning. 
But there is no question that Bitcoin needs to scale if it is going to be anything other than another footnote to the virtual cash system that will eventually come.
I look forward to us all having a reasoned, respectful discussion about this - including developers - and coming up with solutions that allow Bitcoin to reach its potential.
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:07:39
Not a classic booster, but I see you seem to have a grudge against classic.
Seems to me that XT and Classic have been forcing a conversation that needed to be had. I'd prefer to stay with core (see Trace Mayer's comments on the subject) but I also want to see Bitcoin dealing with it's issues so that we can go ahead and get the adoption thing started.
Conversation is good. Putting up alternatives is good. If we all recognize that we all want a strong, functional and revolutionary Bitcoin, all to the good.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:41:10
I wish they would take you up on the offer. A single Bitcoin is better than a fractured one. In the event they alignment can't be reached, it may be best to for it to split and let the community take sides. We'll see which wins. 
On the other hand, a lot of this is also fur being perpetrated by the interests (banks and blockchain companies) that would benefit from a fractured Bitcoin. 
No matter bitcoins future, it needs to scale. Let's define the problems, find solutions, and implement them safely and soon. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 11:30:43

Hi, Sorry to hear your getting hate for asking questions. It does sound like you're trying to pump a single altcoin rather than asking about all of them. There are lots of altcoins and some of them really do have improvements on the original Bitcoin.
Still, Bitcoin has network effect in its corner and so far it doesn't seem like any altcoin is coming anywhere close to dislodging it. That being said, almost everyone I know in the Bitcoin space will chant that Bitcoin is an experiment and may still go to zero - but that if that happens people can flip to one of the alternatives - whatever that would be.
I keep an eye on my favorite altcoins, Dash, Litecoin, and even Ether, despite the recent spamming of Reddit users, but will focus my energies on making Bitcoin a success.
As to the other altcoins, there are too many of them and too many are scams and pump-and-dump schemes.

Well said and thank you for your input. I'm a SegWit supporter who also wants onchain scaling. There should, would, could be a way of doing this but for the pride and partisanship going on. I agree that this could be the moment when Bitcoin relegates itself to a footnote due to self-inflicted wounds.
More than anything else, I think that all name calling and invective, on either side, needs to be called out and downvoted. That's no matter how prominent the person - Mow, Ver, Back. Only comments that that seek to advance the conversation should be upvoted.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:51:18
Point in fact, even with Lightning we're going to need bigger blocks to handle the increased transaction demand. I agree that seven billion people paying for coffee with Bitcoin on chain is not reasonable, but it can't just be blocks of gold. Support segwit, support lightning, support mimblewimbe, suport bigger blocks. All of the above.
@_date: 2016-01-14 13:19:02
I'd agree as well, with the addition that it's the government that created the conditions for the crash.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:37:25
True that many bitcoiners would prefer to stay the course with core, but a large portion of those would also prefer that Core also have on-chain scaling to 2, 4 or 8 mb already in place. It's the arrogance and hardlines that is doing the real damage, and at least half of the blame belongs to Core.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:26:49
Extremist statement. 4mb have been testneted and come up fine.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:08:38
Agreed. SegWit is here, and generally understood to be beneficial, and will lead to off-chain scaling solutions. 
That doesn't get rid of he need for on-chain solutions as well. Interviews I heard with Lightning devs two years ago indicated that they understood that bigger blocks would be needed
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:40:36
Yes, setwit is a real increase in on-chain throughput, but it is less than what is needed. A rise to 2mb would not be an increase to security, but the vitriolic debate is damaging to Bitcoin's viability. Risks come from many directions, and right now Bitcoin's biggest risk is factionalism and an unwillingness to bend.
As for scaling, all of the above, please.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:40:52
It's interesting that this type of vitriol is not censored

@_date: 2017-03-16 14:10:21
OP is a little histrionic, but not wrong. Bitcoin is being held back by internal strife. These are self-inflicted wounds, and they are unnecessary. We cannot succeed until the scaling battle is put behind us - and the vitriol, name calling, and trolling only makes matters worse.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:01:12
But that's just the thing, we don't have that scaling. People are looking for a concrete roadmap for scaling and they don't trust core developers because the stories have changed.
More than anything else, we need a calming of the rhetoric and a coming to the table to really listen and discuss.
I personally agree that BU is not and should not be the answer - but I think it's existence is a result of real concerns and pressures in the community that should be being given more respect.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:32:24
God-fearing is not necessarily a good thing. A lot of the vitriol we have in our politics is from people cherry picking rules form iron-age books.
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:53:38
Unfortunately, Bitcoin is still small enough market that one person can swing the price -- and with the miners and other business out there needing to pay their bills in fiat, sometimes someone just unloads a bunch of coins on an exchange. And then the arbitrage thing happens and the price comes into line on the other exchanges.
We'll know that Bitcoin is finally catching on when we see the volume tick steadily higher, not before. Until then we'll keep to this equilibrium upset occasionally by large buys or sells.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:04:44
Same could be said for core - ref Blcokstream.
Note- I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I think both sides want a successful Bitcoin. I don't discount that hostile forces are trolling both sides to divide and conquer. Unfortunately, with the personalities in this space, all technical acumen and little social skills, that technique is all too apt to win.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:17:33
Agreed, but not so clear on the resolution. I think this is Bitcoin's last great internal boss battle. After this, it may be nigh-impossible to make any substantial change to the protocol. As long as this gets settle with a foundation of scaling built in, and as long as we don't kill ourselves in the process (note that my one tin-foil hat is that outside elements are trolling to make the two camps hate each other even more) then when this is done, we will be back to fighting against the real enemies.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:42:17
BU is a protest vote expressing real concerns about the direction of Bitcoin. If it forces the conversation, it has won. We need scaling, and we need all options on the table. The histrionic attacks on people who discuss bigger blocks IS the problem and forces everyone into more extreme positions. 
It is a pity to see so many key players taking part in the mud slinging.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:42:29
Unfortunately, I think that this is only going to get worse until the people trowing mud pies say 'wait, we're only hurting ourselves - let's work this out.' 
Til then, ...

The miners are not being unfaithful, they are acting in what they see as their own best interest. The only one's not acting in good faith are those slinging invective instead of honest arguments - muddying the waters. This could all go away tomorrow if there was just honest discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:58:48
I don't think that's true. Hard fork is incidental to getting what they want, which is more throughput, which is a very reasonable request. If we had a way of raising throughput in a reasonable amount of time I think everyone would be happy. 
I'm a strong supporter of Segwit, but I also think a reasonable increase of blocksize would be in Bitcoin's best interests.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:59:34
Best idea I've heard in a while. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:01:53
True, but only to the point that Core doesn't seem to want to cut the big blockers any slack. Watching the Core devs and supporters on social media, the arguments are mostly gloating, name calling, etc. I'm not seeing rational arguments presented or respect that the other side DOES want a successful bitcoin, even if their view of what that means differs.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:34:42
Name calling unhelpful. Argue with facts, not FUD, please. Roger and co. have legitimate concerns.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:29:21
If you mean Segwit, you are playing a semantic game. Core are fighting block size increases and have not put forth an actual blocksize increase. Setwit increases throughput, but does not increase size.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:56:39
I see what you did there -  kind of a slippery slope kind of deal.
I support segwit, I support bigger blocks, lightning, Sprite, sidechains, etc. Scaling is not one thing, but we should be flexible and deal with the situation as it is now. Core Devs fighting block increase so long and seemingly to no good purpose has poisoned the waters.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:13:45
Well said, and thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:16:11
No.No - the block size will be 1mb. The throughput will be increased. If I'm wrong, please give a link to a eli5 please.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:37:35
There is the similar question, why did many of the core devs come out so hard against a block size increase when they were initially for it. Adam Back was suggesting a 2,4,8 increase at one point.
Part of the answer is the foulness of the debate - when you call people names, they go further into their corners.
We need both SegWit and block size increases. We need everyone's honest opinion, even if you disagree with it listened to. 
If core would come to the table honestly, I think the big blockers would do so as well, BU could/would/should go away. In the environment of singleness of purpose and trust, the miners would sign on, and we would jump this hurdle.
I feel that is is the boss battle of Bitcoin - we do or don't succeed by how well we do on this test.

@_date: 2017-03-16 14:19:54
Not my understanding at all. The idea was always that if someone could come up with a better way of making Bitcoin work and get a super majority of players to switch, then they would BECOME Bitcoin. 
I'm not a fan of BU per se, but I do think that the concerns of those who want on chain scaling need to be listened to as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:50:51
So, if I read this medium post correctly, by counting differently, the actual size of blocks will be increased. I have not been seeing this anywhere else. Why not?
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:11:09
That may be true, but there is no movement, and on social media, Core devs and dev supporters are very dismissive of and insulting to calls for bigger blocks. If they were open to the idea of, or better, working on bigger blocks, simply communicating the fact and not insulting the other side would go a LONG way to getting rid of the toxic discussion we're having.

Thanks for the reply. Agreed -  everyone (nearly) everyone switched - but of course - that wouldn't be my own preference anyway. I am a strong SegWit supporter, but also think measured increases to blocksize could and should be taken.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:49:30
The white paper says a peer to peer payment system, Satoshi instituted the blocksize limit to interdict spamming before the network was robust enough to handle it and indicated that he thought it could and should be raised, we have full blocks and rising fees.
Also, there was serious talk by some who are now ardent small blockers of raising the limit up to 8 mb. 
We could have had a blocksize increase to relieve pressure and allow  more time for lightning and other processes to be developed an implemented.
These are, in fact, real concerns. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:02:43
Same could be said for core

Interested in the question from the guy who feels that Hodlers need to be motivated to spend more.

@_date: 2017-08-20 23:01:53
No, no it's not. It's an attempt to influence the direction that Bitcoin is taking.
It is a bit of a hard push, and the people doing it think that's necessary because of the uncompromising, trolling, personally attacking nature of the debate.
When you force people out into the cold, they tend t act on their own - and FUD like this causes the problem.
A while back there was a post by a Psyops professional detailing how a government could destroy bitcoin, and he said it would be trivial to get the community to fight itself to death.

The thing is, there are a lot of uses for bitcoin as a store of wealth, as a way to transmit wealth, as a way to avoid financial censorship, that it has the potential to go huge. We haven't hit a trigger point yet for a variety of reasons to do with poor image, internal squabbles, and outside suppression. But, if bitcoin were to catch one with moneyed interests, or across a national population like Argentina, or amonst retirees who see a small investment with huge upside potential, then we'll see a domino effect of adoption. Every will want one, and at that moment, 5,000 a  coin may come to seem extremely cheap.
Problems, squabbles, competition, and sheer waiting have sapped some of the enthusiasm that was here when I first got involved in Bitcoin, but from what I can see, there is still ample reason to keep the faith.

As far as I can tell, Byrne is working to disintermediate banks and disempower Wall Street. These are noble goals that should be supported. He partnered early with CounterParty, but soon realized that the Bitcoin blockchain couldn't handle the volume he needed (see block size debate). He's using all the tools at his disposal. 
If Bitcoin is one of those tools, excellent. If not, then Bitcoin still gets a boost as the originator of the tech - and in the long run it's my opinion that wall-blockchains will be absorbed by the main decentralized blockchain - whatever that turns out to be.
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:39:11
It's to be expected that they would try to "take what they like and leave the rest." And, there's no question that banks and other institutions will be able to realize a lot of advantages by creating their own blockchains.
But walled blockchains will not solve the real problem of banks - the fraud and looting of the the economic system for the benefit of a very few. Bitcoin's strength is that it stands apart from this system and will be there as a safety net when it falls.
Bitcoin is not for the banks, it's to make banks optional.

You say that the miners interest aligns with the users. I don't think this is true at all. The miners interest is to make money, pure and simple. They engage in a hash power race, pumping Pyle difficulty up far exceeding what btc needs to secure transactions at current values and open btc up to charges of 51% attack and excessive power consumption. They are no different than traders who depress the price at the expense of user confidence and adoption.

Initially, yes. But if the price goes up like we all hope it will, it will eventually become more in demand than local currencies and you'll see bitcoin purchases will become the norm.

In the long run, doesn't it seem likely that a lot of dust transactions (coffee purchases, etc.) will take place off/side/other chain and that larger, more important transactions and contracts will take place on chain? The miners will get fees, which will still be low but not negligeble, and people in the third world will be able to transact freely without the friction of fees because of offchain options.

That's a very hard line you take there. We all believe things that later turn out not be true. It takes being sympathy and patient explanation to overcome. 
Remember, in the current environment of competing 'facts,' figuring out which ones are true is a real achievement. Not just in the Bitcoin space either.

I was going with you all the way up to the slam on Ver. I realize he's he's been much more divisive than need be, but the shit is slinging both ways. The concerns he brings to the table are real and deserve recognition and the personal attacks are what makes BU supporters feel they HAVE to look for an alternative.
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:18:43
Because the situation is too screwed up to really believe that this is a real thing. 
The scaling fight is not resolved and there is no clear indication as to when it will be.
The situation with Bitfinex and other exchanges has not be resolved - so that there are huge differentials in the price on exchanges.
It's not clear what is driving the increase, and it's not clear that the increase can be sustained - so everyone is muted and waiting to see what shoe is going to drop to bring the price back down to earth.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:53:07
Core is just a name to describe the handful of developers who have commit access to the most popular bitcoin client. They currently decide what bitcoin is. 
Andresen has a different vision of bitcoin that is in line with the white paper. His move may have been unsuccessful in becoming 'bitcoin,' but he is not 'rogue.'
I do wish that all BU or Classic or XT had done was copy the core client and just change that 1 to a 2. 
More than that I wish that core developers did not denegrate developers with different ideas or business leaders who have an actual use for bitcoin. 
Scaling is a necessity. Doing so safely is a necessity. We don't need the pyrrhic battles fighting between those two things. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 09:03:21
Not sure what all the fear over a hard f fork is for. They have happened before. Since I've been in Bitcoin, I've been constantly told that Bitcoin can update with features from altcoins to make it better. Further, I have been constantly told that scaling is something that could and would be addressed. Now that we hit a moment when people are talking about it seriously, some people flip their lids.
I am in support of the continued development of and improvement of Bitcoin. Scaling was always the plan, even according to Satoshi. Discussing things so that we do it right, great. But for my money, the people calling psy-ops are more likely the ones to be doing it - always name call first so you won't be discovered!

I'm not finding anything controversial in what he's saying here. His comment is not trolling; it is observing that core supporters/devs too often resort to personal attacks - something they would not feel the need to do if their arguments were really that cut and dried.
It's unfortunate that certain topics are censored on both reddits. Rather, comments that degrade the tone of the debate need to be censored - not arguments, however flawed.
That's when peer review and progress to actually take place, but rather we have as post with a title which is a smear on the man's intellect or intellectual honesty.

@_date: 2017-04-16 06:47:54
I do believe that discussions over how to scale, and what Bitcoin is and how it will be used, are important.
That being said, I agree with your thesis: Bitcoin is still developing and is not yet ready to be a world currency, reserve currency, or settlement layer. This can (will) happen, but it will take more development both in the core protocol and second, third, ... layers. 
The only thing I'd add is that a move to Bitcoin is likely not going to be incremental or happen without a catalyst. Bitcoin will have its true moment when a large political or financial crisis shakes people's faith in governments and government backed currencies to make them want to try something different.
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:16:28
Or psyops.
Read a post a few years back that when Bitcoin got attacked, it wouldn't be through government regulation, it would be banks throwing a measly million at some firm to troll the community into hating itself.
Seems the banks are winning after all.
Let's accept all arguments made in the spirit of improving Bitcoin, even if we disagree. Let's downvote all conspiracy theories, personal attacks, etc., even if made by Bitcoin luminaries. That's the real way forward.

They are the only ones who build the client that everyone else uses or builds around. They are limited because users and miners have a say, but the have there hands on a key point of power - classic, BU, and XT are no where near being able to supplant them.

So, basically, someone asks a polite question - inviting refutation of his 'obvious facts' - and you slam him for asking the question. This, in a nutshell, is the problem.
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:25:06
That's not a fair comparison and you know it.
Roger has shown he is not perfect a number of times, including when he toured MT Gox and declared everything fine. He also has built successful businesses from the ground and done wonderful things for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Karpeles Bought a business he didn't have the skill or temperament to handle and let it implode around him. 
Roger may be wrong (or not!) about his method of solving the problem, but he's not wrong in pointing out a problem that we all knew was coming for years. It's one the developers could and should have planned a solution for, or at least have a roadmap in place people trust would be followed.
What I'm saying is his perspective is valid even if you disagree with his solution.

Quite the reverse. I think that Bitcoin has to pass through a massive speculation stage of many people hodling, driving the price up to the point where it is so in demand that it can be used anywhere for anything.

Hi,  I'll take the criticism about not mentioning VPNs. I would say that the title is not fud as the point is not the specific effect of this law, but the actions the government takes.

I'm from the tail-end of the boomer generation. Most of the people I work with are 20s and 30s. They all know that I hold Bitcoin, and they all know the reasons. We spend hours talking about how bad things get and how much worse things could get. And not one of them has even taken me up on the offer to set up a wallet and get a gift of Bitcoin.
I don't see Bitcoin being adopted gradually. I see a 2008 sized event suddenly panicking people and forcing them to look for alternatives - and Bitcoin will be there. There will be strife and famine, but Bitcoin will not be the cause (it will, however, be blamed), it will be part, only part, of the solution.

I don't accept your definition of me as not being a real 'bitcoin warrior.' I don't need your approval. 
Not that I need to defend, but I am a hodler since early 2013. I have been evangelizing for years. I tend to keep my powder dry for talking to people outside the community and try to lead them in.
Unfortunately, reddit is a big place for people to come, and when they see the circular firing squad we got going over here, then it's not all that attractive. People who question intent, like your 'not the words of a btcwarrior,' are exactly what I'm talking about.
Fact is, most of the people getting smeared are actually people who have different visions or values, but trying to do good. Ver, good man. Maxwell, Back, etc. Good men. Often they say or do things I don't agree with - but I do think they are doing what they think is best.
The two things that am not so tolerant of is intolerance and name calling. 
I also think that although these subreddits do need to be moderated, quashing content and not attacks is the wrong way to go - and that goes for both subreddits.
I don't question whether you are a bitcoiner, but I do question whether you are helping or hurting the community, and the development of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:05:22

I'm a warrior for promoting what BTC can be - but that doesn't mean I have to be a maximalist, and it certainly doesn't mean I have to attack people personally. Let's debate ideas about how to make BTC succeed - and that may mean coexisting with bcash next to BTC as gold.

At a time when you and I had never heard of bitcoin, he had seized on it and believed in it. He 'threw around a lot of bitcoin' as a way to get new people interested. He invested in many of the earliest bitcoin companies which helped them get started and built the network. 
I've met the man. I like the man. I think he's a little rabid at times, as lot of people get. Bitcoin's biggest problem is not a scaling problem, it is a rhetoric problem. If we all cut down on the rhetoric and worked on solving the actual problems, even if we're pursuing contradictory paths, then everything will be fine. l

Roger 'the felon' (a point that has nothing to do with this conversation and is meant merely to smear him and distract from the fact that he also did enormous things for growing bitcoin for years) may certainly be wrong about how to scale BTC. I still hold some BCH, but I'm more excited for scaling possibilities in BTC. Yet, there are no certainties and having BTC and other alt coins around is a net positive.
Except for people who choose to engage in internecine, scorched earth conflict.

I'm not sure an efficient market interpretation is reasonable for Bitcoin. A single actor can swing the price, easily, right now.

It's also fair to say that a large proportion of users don't agree with the eight. Not on everything, at least. I support segwit because it seems to be the best way forward, and BU seems to buggy to trust.  I also support on-chain scaling and am frustrated by the intransigence of some.
Also, saying that 100 percent of core developers agree is neither provable nor probably true. Some may wish things were going in a different direction, but, like me, be supporting the best way forward. Further, the vitriol and attacks in this debate mean that people who don't agree either leave or stay quiet.

Both do it, and they both censor the wrong damn things. Personal attacks and slander need to be removed - not comments constructive to an actual conversation, even if the info is misinformed.
I do not downvote posts or comments I disagree with. I downvote posts and comments that don't maintain a respectful level of debate.

True that hashing is a service that must be paid for, but price is not hashpower/kwh. Price for Bitcoin is purely demand/supply. Hashpower has to re-adjust to price if it goes too low, and currently we are over-hashed.
The transaction to the dude next to you does not clear through a supercomputer in Iceland. It clears through a world-wide consensus network. The computer that wins the right to write that transaction into the blockchain (and get the reward for doing so) may be a supercomputer, may be in a cave in Iceland, but might also be an Antminer dongle hanging off the side of the laptop I type this on.

Interestingly, the thinking now is that those coins have been abandoned, but ... they are still counted when calculating market cap.

The Good: I agree that it's good to call people out, question, and highlight when people are using fallacies, trolling, etc. Without checking, based on what you said, sounds like you might have a point.
The Bad: Not also acknowledging that there is quite a lot of fallacies, trolling, personal attacks and smears and a suppression of points of view on this sub.
Do call out bad actors, but please do it on both sides of the argument
It's long been my argument that the moderation policy on both subs is wrong - we do not need an exclusion of points of view or topics as long as th relate to Bitcoin. We do need strong policies on trolling and personal smears.
These, much more than the actual technical requirements, is what is causing the rift in the bitcoin community. And that is what THEY want.

Thanks for the reply. 
Interesting response. Made me think. 
Two thoughts, is this a conversation where you might learn as well as teach, or a screaming match where every blares at full volume and no one listens. This is our current situation. If you note the mote in your own eye before pointing out the speck in your conversational partner's, you show an openness to learn as well as teach. This encourages the same attitude in the other. 
Two: I think it is the responsibility of people on both sides of debates to call out bad actors, liars, trolls, name callers, etc. Me calling out someone on the other side does nothing, but calling out someone on my own side might help make a more productive debate.

Who hired them? Who pays them? If we have core devs who shouldn't be fired, isn't that centralization? Isn't the point of open source that if anyone has a better or more useful idea that they can take it in that direction - as long as the users follow, then that is the correct direction.

I respect the skill and contributions of the core developers - but in this scenario - if they make even one mistake, then the sequence of events would be disastrous. Don't idolize the developers.

Hi drcross,
I would tend to agree with you. And, in a perfect world, I think that bitcoin would not stand a chance.
But my view is not informed merely by my ignoring the signs of the last crash, it is in viewing what has taken place after it. Thing have gotten worse, not better. What reforms have been enacted are weak. 
The signs of another crash are as evident, and as actively denied, as the signs of climate change. The people who anticipate it and are ready, may just come out ahead.
I fully recognize that there is no guarantees, here, but not saying anything is what feels to me to be the most dangerous thing.

It is good to be concerned about these things.  We need to protect ourselves, and at the same time we can address the issues to make BTC user friendly for when mom and pop start to test the waters.
One thing that caught my eye is the idea that someone could walk away with millions if they hacked a company site. In the last few big thefts of bitcoin, it is possible to track where those bitcoin went. They have tended to go to addresses and then sit there. We know the bitcoins that were stolen, and at some point it would be possible to create a registry showing bitcoins that are tainted/blacklisted. 
It is also not at all true that bitcoin is anonymous. It is possible to be anonymous, if you are careful. But it is also possible to track the trajectory of bitcoin. So, in the future, when there is a need for tracking criminals, a crypto-forensics unit will be able to isolate addresses and track bitcoin to track down the criminals. It might be hard, but tracking cash is hard too. Its what they do.
Finally, regulation will be a good thing and needs to be accepted if bitcoin is going to really come into its own.

Bitcoin could survive sizable government attacks once the economy hits a tipping point of size and functionality. It's not there yet, but another couple of pushes and consolidation periods will push it over.

Couple of things caught my eye in reading this,
"Even if it would be hard to enforce tax laws on bitcoin transactions, it isn’t always impossible either when physical or virtual goods are delivered, and in any event, any doubts about its legality drive away many potential users and consign Bitcoin to a marginal status"
Of course there will be those who will want to use bitcoin to dodge taxes, just like there are people who get paid under the table now. Or have an account in the Caymans. But once bitcoin is established, there will be point of sale taxes, income taxes, etc. And, although hard, it will not be impossible for a digital IRS to assign addresses to individuals and prosecute them for tax evasion. Bitcoin is going to be a lessening of governmental control, but not its elimination.
"That leads to a second difficulty. Bitcoin’s value has been anything but stable: it has in fact exhibited dramatic fluctuations and commodity bubble behavior."
Of COURSE, it has. And will continue to. Bitcoin is in a speculation phase and the speculation is what will get a lot of  people interested in and using it. Bitcoin will be a ticket to a better life for many, and that is a good thing. But, it is not likely to knock off the big currencies, and most people are going to continue to want to operate mostly in their own currency - even when bitcoin becomes a second option. So, as the price rises, we are going to see many of the hoarders cashing out, pouring bitcoin into the system, depressing the price, which will get more people buying since they see the long-term trend, which will raise the price, ...
"This necessarily involves some kind of political process, which is exactly what the designers of Bitcoin hoped to avoid. They wanted money free of political interference, even of their own political interference. This freedom from politics is always an illusion, because money is ultimately an agreement among human beings"
Bitcoin is meant to be as free as possible from governmental interference, but not at all free of politics. Its very creation is a political statement. If governments and financial systems worked for the benefit of the mass of people, bitcoin wouldn't even exist as an idea.  Far from being free of political interference, bitcoin is, at its heart, deeply political.
@_date: 2013-08-04 01:05:21

Hi Todamont,
Well, most of the people borrowing from Coinlenders are actually businesses dealing with bitcoin like exchanges. If a lot of people what bitcoin out at the same time, they may need to bolster their reserves by borrowing from someone like CoinLenders. This is on of the things that makes this site safer than some others.  The people doing the borrowing are institutional and want to keep their good name. For me, borrowing from CoinLenders (or BTCJam) is not really an option.  But if I am going to hold long-term, putting my coin here makes sense, since it will be growing both through appreciation and through compound interest. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 12:39:22

Hi AboutDeSouffle,
I am not at all convinced that crashes will happen once every ten years. We had minimal volatility for nearly fifty years after the Great Depression due to sensible regulation. What I have looked for is a concerted effort to fix the problems that led to the crash in 2007, and what has been done often seems too little, too late. 
I see bitcoin as a refuge currency --  one that is gaining traction because of a general feeling that the current status quo cannot hold, and one that may eventually succeed because it will allow people to take control of some part of the finances back from the banks.
The spikes and crashes that we have seen in BTC so far have ended with BTC better established than it was before the round of extreme volatility. This volatility is going to continue and it is going to scare away a lot of people. But if, and I do say if, the fiat market tanks, then BTC is going to start looking pretty good.
I appreciate your opinion.
