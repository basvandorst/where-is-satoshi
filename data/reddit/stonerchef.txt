Certainly does,  alts in general rise and fall with bitcoin,  there are some outliers but the overall market follows bitcoin in general. 
Have a look here  and look at the charts
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:49:19
I don't know what the price will land at,  but I have felt the rise from 3k to 18k+ was built on greed and looking for a quick profit. It felt unnatural and far too fast,  the market cap became totally untethered to reality. Without stable growth people will always be investing for the wrong reasons and will be easily frightened into a sale. 
Going to be a wild couple of weeks,  no doubt. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:20
Pretty much yeah. They ride and fall in much the same timeframe,  with occasional overperformers as outliers.

Pretty sure it was somewhere north of $1000, but not much more than that. Gox was a good 10-15 percent higher than most and it topped out at around $1240 or there about.

@_date: 2014-05-23 12:17:50
This is about right, but the Gox price at the time was much higher and I think that this fueled a surge on other exchanges caused by people buying at a 'bargain' price in comparison to the price on Gox.

People remember things like this, by anniversary I don't mean a specific date, but it was leading up to Christmas when there was a huge buzz, people panic buying alts etc. People have disposable income at that time of year and time off.
If I expect some action at that time of year I bet there's some others thinking the same,  so speculation of a rise could be self fulfilling.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:08:11
There was money to be made on localbitcoins by buying and selling. Small margins but if you plug away you can make some profit. 
I was fortunate during the alt boom, I sat buying and selling mint coin and taking profits. 
I also sold alts in eBay, I sold at half the price of anyone else when the price was crazy and made 10k in 2 weeks before eBay shut down the selling.
I maybe have had a lucky run, but im constantly looking for opportunities and trying to stay ahead of the curve.
It is my hobby and its been good to me. I hold just 3 coins now, bought at aroung 600. I'll be buying 4 more if we hit 280, for me this is my magic number and fully expect to make a profit on those by new year. I will cash those out at 650 depending how fast the market is moving. I also make purchases with bit coin and top up by that amount to keep my balance steady.

I would hold out for a bit longer. It's coming up for the anniversary of the last bubble and expectation could see an upward push.
I made my bitcoin work for me rather than seeing them as a static investment. I've made my money back on my coins. If you hold many there are ways to make them earn their keep.

@_date: 2014-10-04 11:56:18
It is a payment system and people bought in BECAUSE of the volatility thinking it will only go up. It is young and the infrastructure is expanding very fast. I don't know what it's value will settle on, but I don't see how that's possible until all coins are mined. 
It is in that sort of timescale I believe investors should be thinking or reaping returns.

@_date: 2014-01-25 11:19:48
The returns from mining with computers are not as large as you think they are. Also there are a limited number of coins that will ever be in existence - 21 million. So your worries in that respect are unfounded.
Also, yes, you can sell coins for money.
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:03:10
If you believe in Bitcoin it's not a gamble but an investment. Stocks and shares go up and down and you are around 200 down per coin at the moment or 25 percent. That is recoverable and I strongly believe the price will rise before the end of the year.
The infrastructure is enormous compared to last year, the adoption rate continues to accelerate. If I was a betting man I'd say the signs point to a rise in the long term, but as I'm an investor I'm going along for the ride/
Did you think you'd cash out in one year with millions? Probably no. If the price had risen more than it did, or climbed too high too fast (more so than it did) the fall would have been so huge that Bitcoin would have died in the crash. It's building slowly as it should, but there may be an explosion waiting to happen further down the road. Big business are sniffing about it now, lots of big business. 
Good luck with whatever you decide to do, selling may be right for you. But be prepared to kick yourself as I don't think many people think reaching 800 again is particularly unlikely.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:53:53
Lol dat panic.
I  had planned on buying at 280. Going to wait till tomorrow, if it hits 250 or so, I'm taking a couple coins for sure.
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:44:11
It depends on many things, but I think the is a lot of trust still to be built and a lot of people who bought in high will sell off again when they break even.
The rise may be a lot steadier than before but also a lot more stable because nervous investors, once cashed out, are unlikely to re invest and the coins will end up in longer term players hands.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:29:05
21 million in total. It is set by the design of the coin and cannot be increased by anyone. People are buying to invest, make purchases or trade with other coins. you can pay for things online, in some shops taxis etc with bitcoin already and that is surely going to increase.
The limited supply of the coin and it's functionality are big reasons that people are buying them and a reason they could have a massive growth in value.
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:53:20
A service is exactly what a middleman is. They are in between the two parties buying/selling or sending/receiving. They invariably add a cost to what would be a cheaper transaction without them.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:03:15
I don't think you should pour in more money. You have enough invested, the coins are still being mined and I believe the true value of the coins will only become more settled when nearly all coins are mined. Miners dumping is probably quite a big factor in the price drops. 
I believe the timescale for serious returns is between 3 to 10 years, I think there will be a spike around Christmas again but as to a value it's not easy to predict. 
Bitcoins were at 280 a few months ago if I remember, then charged back up to over 600. It doesn't take much to send the value either way. When you consider the total number of coins that will be available it appears coins are cheap right now. If adoption and use continue to rise it is not unimaginable that we hit ATH levels again or go much further. It is also possible that there will be a long stagnant period of going between 250 and 700.

Your survey sounds like it's geared to finding marks, with questions such as how much do you trust bitcoin? Because if people use your service it is not bitcoin they have to trust, it's you. seems very manipulative and reeks of a scam.

@_date: 2015-01-03 21:51:54
Last time it dipped I said the floor would be 280 and that was very close, I think this might hit 265 (or even 245 if there's a real sell- off) within a day or two. Can't imagine it falling further than that, there's got to be some buy support for coins at this price. I'm planning on buying 2 around 270, I expect a rebound to around 330 by end of next week.
All speculation of course, but this sort of feels so familiar. I'd be utterly shocked if the price didn't rebound in a few days.

I'll be dropping 1k if it hits around 5.5k another if it goes sub 3k and thats my limit for buying until things get a bit more steady.
Things have been fucked for quite some time with the Bitcoin market. Too much greed, not enough informed "investors", because that is what it became: an investment. Whether it is rocketing up or crashing down this is a bad thing for something supposedly to be a currency. It's not been true growth, it's been careless speculation and the very definition of a bubble. It's happened before and will happen again no doubt.
I got out before the end of last year as i was unhappy with the velocity of price movement and didn't find it sustainable, fees were becoming utter nonsense and the very concept of the coin was lost.
What happened to bitcoin helping bankless Africans etc? You think they would pay those fucking fees? It just became a commodity of no practical use and until the price goes back to where I think it should be or bitcoin again becomes on track to be actually USEFUL I will carry on as a spectator.
If we don't see 5.6k or less in the next few days I'll be quite surprised.

This is quite a big point. Understanding bitcoin in its entirety is not needed by the population. Most people don't know how normal banking works. Things such as IBAN, swift codes, CHAPS etc just *work* no further reading needed.
Bitcoin needs to be decluttered and drastically simplified. Adoption has to increase by magnitudes to stop the constant need for fiat exchange. Only when people no longer need to buy bitcoin (part of paycheck) and merchants no longer need to cash in bitcoin to make payments (expanded adoption to major suppliers, services, utilities) the market is going to be in the hands of the speculators and dumping miners. Stability (and stable growth) comes when the ecosystem is self sustaining, this is nowhere near the case now.

Could someone save me the bother of clicking each link on  and tell me if it U.S.A exclusively. (Physical gifts rather than online services is what I'm after)
Muchos thanks.

What is this shit? I've seen it posted in comments too?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:37:44
Nah. Thanks.

As I've said before. Criminals have previously used almost exclusively currency, no one said shit about blaming cash.
Criminals going to criminal, whatever the medium and this kind of guff is either ill-informed or purposefully misleading.

I like how they are making a connection with Bitcoins and MILLIONS to the public, lol.

Just heard him saying that 'we missed it' re:bitcoins in a woeful voice.
I think this will be a common misconception at the moment and should be addressed.

I think that's the 'extra cost' he's talking about. Markups 15%+

As is always the case, by the time I'm infuriated by a subject and it's comments enough to call in, they are talking about gardening or some shit

Getting bitcoins for a service rather than handing over cash is the BEST way to get them. The adoption in the U.K is minimal at the moment, but I'm sure you'd find some interest in time.

I think it will hit a shitload of sell orders round about the $1000 mark then either take a temp tumble or go rocketing. Exciting times.

Oh god, I can't decide which of you helpful fuckers to give gold to. lol

Yup, if your *that* rich you barely pay taxes.

Also a lot of callers talking balls as usual. Typical ignorant yet opinionated people who call in that show. It used to be more balanced but now just seems like 2 extremes colliding into a misinformed shouting match.

You find a seller with the best price and select how many coins you want or how much currency you want to spend. Once this is done the bitcoins are held in escrow (a safe place on the site) until the sender recieves payment. In the meantime you will be given the sellers bank details and are expected to send the money within 90 mins. You send the money from your internet banking (usually) then mark the payment as sent. The seller will receive notification and will check his balance. When he gets his cash you will receive the allocated coins.
