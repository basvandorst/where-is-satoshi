Bitcoin has already been classified as a commodity
The SEC hearing tomorrow is regarding securities.  If ethereum is classified as a security tomorrow exchanges will need to register as brokers, and peer to peer sales will become illegal.  
The difference is bitcoin has been mined fairly while ethereum was an ICO.  Taking money for an ICOs can change the legal definition of a product.  There's a fine line between consumer protection and government interference, but some tokens are flat out scams while others may not be. 
This whole debate shouldn't affect bitcoin, and we still don't know the extent it will effect security like blockchain tokens.

Bitpay was giving me errors on purchasing a giftcard the other day.  They played the overpay on bitcoin or use bcash option even though the bitcoin mempool was clearing next block.  
The errors I was getting transferring made me go through checkout like 5 times when I've never had a problem using their service before.  What ended up happening was I maxed out my giftcard purchases for 24 hours while the cards were in the pending screen, so I just signed out and gave up. 
I ended up spending the bits on puroexpress because they just simply accept bitcoin without using a 3rd party.

Probably best to save some money up and make small purchases.
If you're into gaming some good gaming computers have GPUs that can mine altcoins which get you into the market. 
But like I said the most efficient way starting from nothing is to make some money and transfer that into bitcoin in small increments every month or so to limit market variance.

Bitcoin had the segwit upgrade ready for a long time but the miners blocked it.  Segwit prevented covert asicboost so it's speculated that was one of the reasons the miners stalled it.  Another reason why the miners stalled segwit is that miners don't make money off 2nd layer transactions.  Coinbase and other actors refused to upgrade their software to accommodate the segwit blocksize increase.  
32mb blocks aren't going to be tested until people start actually using bcash. 
Mass adoption on chain breaks bitcoins properties of decentralization.  This is why 2nd layer solutions are being explored.  I used lightning a few times and it's 20x faster and cheaper than bcash.  The 2nd layer also opens up more complex smart contracts that are being developed.  Also we didn't want to go with S2X or bcash because it changed who had the commit access of the repo.  As we saw S2X failed on the first block so we don't want to be handing the keys over to a new team of developers.

The thing is we are not talking about a business like amazon or paypal.  Anyone with a centralized network can up the hardware in the server room to move more data.  Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized distributed consensus network.  
The debate comes down to everyone can't verify a network if you allow all the data exchanges to appear on chain.  Only centralized mining farms or services like coinbase would be able to afford to run a system like bcash.  If mass adoption happens the amount of bandwidth and hardware required to confirm the network centralizes all the nodes.  This is where you have fake satoshi craig saying fuck anyone who can't afford a $30,000 node and bitcoin being a childs project being able to sync a node with a raspberry pi.
The cash crowd will say oh non mining nodes don't contribute to the network, but they do in a not so obvious way.  They are able to check and make sure everyone is following the rules.  Allowing everyone even the small players to confirm the network's rules are being followed is the whole point of bitcoin.
If the large nodes made a decision to change the rules or censor transactions or whatever attack they want to do, it would be extremely hard to take the control back.  By making nodes expensive and everything going on chain we can't fork the network away from bad actors.  It would be too cost prohibitive, and I believe if bitcoin ever fell into that position it would be a failure.  This doesn't even address the bandwidth and latency issues large blocks create.

Satoshi also assumed moore's law would continue, but in 2015 it broke and slowed down.  This factor would have affected satoshi's projections on the hardware available to support the network while remaining decentralized.

ethereum forked away from the original chain just like bitcoin cash
ethereum is even more contentious because they forked to salvage money developers lost due to bad code.  It's a problem that continues to this day and so many other people lost money on parity and more that they want the fork too.  But it seems that only select people get forks in their favor it's really sketchy.

this ought to wake up some major chip manufacturers, lets get some competition in mining with the latest chips 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:17:52
For a short period of time yes, but it would also wreck anyone who  invested sha-256 miners.  Those people would be reluctant to buy another bitcoin miner again.  This lowers confidence of any chip fabricators to enter in the mining space, and develop a bitcoin mining chip.  Bitmain has the chip fabrication facilities and knows how to make good ASICs and they'll clean up shortly after the switch. 
I think costing bitmain some money short term isn't worth the consequences a decision like this would create. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:39:54
They made 4 billion dollars last year and know how to cook up a new ASIC.  They would have the largest advantage in a change, and a change hurts the honest SHA-256 miners around the world.

I think this idea is retarded.  Like others have said this screws any bitmain competitors, and people like cobra and luke even talking about this creates a scary amount of uncertainty that could preemptively cancel any competitors plans.
What's a PoW change going to do?  Ethereum has bitmain ASICs now, Siacoin has bitmain ASICs that blew out the developers ASICs.  Many other coins that hit a valuation to make ASICs profitable get ASICs made.  The kings of ASICs bitmain will dominate this field no matter what until someone with enough money can compete. 
Now isn't the time when we have dragonmint, samsung, and others planning on building SHA-256 ASICs. Also these chips are getting extremely small nm size meaning they will remain the most efficient for years to come.

I didn't see them dump on bcash in the article but they mentioned they look to work with bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin for their decentralized ID system.
Something else they mentioned is they were looking at decentralzied storage, and I know there are a few altcoins that do this.  I've been researching some of them but there's always something creepy where bitcoin remains the most fair.  Like siacoin you get paid in sia for offering your harddrive and you pay sia to rent space.  Then there's their drama over ASICs and 4% of every agreement goes to Siafunds which is owned by nebulous.
I wonder if a decentralized storage chain could be integrated into a layer of bitcoin without the worry of a centralized owner or advanced ASIC group.

PoS scares me especially when most of their distributions are held by the developers.
There's an ethereum developer openly supporting communism and claiming he will do everything he can in his power to influence who gets to use ethereum and how they get to use it.  If the case of ethereum the developers gave themselves 12,000,000 coins and presold an additional 60,000,000.  They would have the power to influence transactions when they move to PoS
Here is some tweets from ethereum developers. 
Also look at Jason Bloomberg's article 
Some quotes from this article.
"One of the technical reasons why permissionless blockchain is inherently flawed is because it leverages ‘proof of work’ mining."
"Some counterarguments to my argument to shut down cryptos basically stated that there are alternatives to proof of work-based permissionless blockchain. However, proof-of-stake is still largely on the drawing board, and in any case, a lot of it is permissioned – and thus those approaches may very well be better than permissionless."
For these reasons I don't like the idea of PoS.

It's just a bad idea to switch the PoW algorithm at this point.  There are competitors to bitmain developing SHA-256 chips right now.  Samsung, dragonmint, and many others.  There are also more and more mining locations and investments springing up in Russia, Iceland, and many other locations.
The SHA-256 chip is the most advanced mining chip nearing limits of moore's law and physics.  You're starting to see altcoins introducing ASICs and they're getting blown out by bitmain with their funds and factories making the most efficient chips.  Starting over from square one would only hurt bitcoin and wind up with worse results than what we have now.  I believe were nearing a point where the next generation of ASICs will be the same nano meter size for several years.  This coupled with mainstream players will even out the field.  Starting over will create another race to small nm chips. 
I believe when there's enough money at stake even GPU algorithms will have an ASIC developed, and changing the algorithm constantly is detrimental.

sorry I was in a mood this morning, but the average block time for bitcoin is 10 minutes the average for litecoin is 2.5 minutes 
variance can give you confirmations in 1 second anywhere to a couple hours.  So it's not genuine to talk about confirmations in x seconds because the code dictates since the beginning the average block being 2.5min or a little less because the difficulty continually increases.

@_date: 2018-02-26 00:49:47
The only way I see PoW becoming completely decentralized is if there's an ASIC created for a certain algo with like 9nm or 7nm chip size that's distributed to everyone around the world before the coin goes live and people all have to use the same costs for electricity, and that's never going to happen because everyone is competing with each other.
We're never going to get an initial distribution of coin as good as bitcoin was distributed.  Heck even gold isn't fairly distributed but we all respect it and give it a similar value.  Someone can pan flakes of gold in California or be more efficient with bulldozers in Alaska.  Someone can mine bitcoin more efficient with fast ASICs or slower with old ASICs or GPUs.  Like it or not bitmain deserves this place because they took the risk and were able to coordinate their operations efficiently.  To me, I believe bitcoin is SHA-256 until the algorithm itself is revealed to be cracked.

Of course regulatory agencies have failed us, look at glass-steagall legislation and going off the gold standard.
We ought to move past these dumb financial tools and move onto something more fair.  I think using your bitcoin as a tool is more valuable than hoarding it away.  Look at lightning network perhaps you can get a percentage return for hosting your coins in a node and routing transactions.  Then look at short term loans to margin traders that's another financial tool that gives returns.  From there more advanced tools will be developed and we should be accepting of them to keep money moving and the bitcoin economy healthy. 
I don't think we should replicate current tools that fail, but become more transparent with our holdings and build off of that.

People might say oh these turing complete nodes are centralized to the federation of RSK nodes, but at least it's transparent.  I don't think I can find information on how many people are still able to maintain an ethereum full node.  The amount of data and bandwidth require for an ethereum full node is outrageous, and in my opinion is a horrible method of transferring "currency" across the platform.
I'm really interesting in seeing how RSK develops, and I like the model of separating a turing complete smart contract sidechain from the very secure and distributed main chain.  This gives bitcoin the best of both world without having to worry about forking over nonsense like DAO and parity or massive security issues when trying to put all the data onto one chain.

My opinion on how we got here is on October 31st CME announces futures trading.  Institutional money knows they can exploit this feature on a major platform.  So they started buying up bitcoins until the FUD starts for segwit2x in middle November.  Segwit2x was an attempted takeover of the development team by major businesses in bitcoin such as the DCG bitpay and coinbase.
After that fud passed the institutional money continued to buy.  This happened until a little after futures started going live on December 11th.  Later that week we hit the all time high and in my opinion this is when big money shorted bitcoin on CME and sold what they bought on the run up to 19k+.  This was a big move to make money and manipulate the market with the help of mainstream media and fomo.
After a few months of shorts this is where we are.  We are near equilibrium with a lot more users, LN is live, and there's all kinds of great stuff going on in bitcoin.  
I don't think the price will go much lower, but it can.  I think we'll start to see some calmness in the market as we grow.  Bitcoin is bigger and better than ever and this is a really exciting time.

PoS gives these people too much power to decide what happens on chain in the future.

I see it as a network equivalent of gold vs fiat.  With PoS you have major nodes calling the shots similarly to how central authority figures call the shots in fiat.  With PoW you it's all fair game and anyone can support the network's security and get a piece of the rewards.  People who mine and secure gold could also be providing a service instead, but look at what is money and what's most secure.
A lot of the articles on energy costs are skewed too.  Bitcoin is using the most efficient miners in the most efficient areas.  Most major miners are stationed near power plants and get a discount on surplus electricity.  It isn't like they're taking electricity from a town that needs it or using diesel generators.

I'm so excited about this technology.  They also added decimal places so mSatoshi is possible.  So my fee was like 6000 mSat.  As the lightning network grows the transaction fee on lightning is going to drop.  There's going to be more routes and competition among channels for lowest forwarding fee.  So there's room for bitcoin to grow significantly in price as well as infrastructure while keeping extremely low fees and extremely high transaction throughput.  This is all on a blockchain with light and predictable memory requirement to operate a node, keeping the network secure and decentralized. I can't get over how amazing this is.

Give it a rest dude, you don't have to attack his beliefs like that.  Especially spying on his family and their spiritual practices 
look at his work and lets talk about that.  That's really the only thing that matters here. 
Also it's ironic you're calling his beliefs anti-semitic while trashing everything he believes in.  The jews have strong beliefs about the goy but this isn't the place to debate it.

I don't think bitcoin should be boiled down into debate club.  Roger had his script and prepared his sales pitch while Samson was getting into ideas but they were not as refined.  Like another poster said there are better speakers in bitcoin to explain technicalities.  
Overall I think big blocks are a bad idea.  One reason I see is that when there are few node operators the users lose control.  You can't have a user activated fork when node costs are tremendous.  You'll give complete control to the big operators in the space.  If that's the case, who can watch the watchmen?  If that ever happened the project should be abandoned as it isn't the ethos of bitcoin.

These are some tweets from an ethereum developer

My experience with Eclair is the 1st channel I made through them couldn't find a route, and the 2nd channel lost my funds in a "uncooperative closing"
I would recommend people wait until they have something functional.

Trying to buy a blockstream sticker and getting the error RemoteFailure channel is currently disabled.  Is this a problem on my end or theirs?
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:33:07
my analysis is better than memetriangles 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:05:05


That's probably it I'll update tomorrow if I get them back
edit: I didn't get the bitcoin back after 144 blocks :(

PoW is just more fair, anything buying selling mining etc. is speculation, but the distributed PoW is the most secure and fair distribution method.

what are you bbqing I'm hungry 
enjoy your day! 
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:38:17
I hope so.  It looks like intel and samsung are entering the mining game this year.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:10:52
Same thing happened to me is there any resolution to this issue or should I assume this bitcoin is gone?  I'm kind of pissed eclair released such a buggy wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:36:59
Thank you for providing this guide.  I was able to recover my funds. 
I'll give eclair another look in the future but the 1st release was pretty bad. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:58:57
download eclair wallet they're a mobile wallet service that uses lightning network, and open up a lighting channel.  That's the most user friendly way to join the lightning network.
see the few stores accepting LN scan the qr code and pay 
I made my first lightning network transaction today it took about a second to confirm and the fee was 6 satoshi total, not sat/byte, 6 satoshi total $0.0005 for a bitcoin transaction.  It really is amazing technology.

awesome man glad to see people like you posting here.
again sorry about being a dick I'm stressing over the dip but shouldn't be 
have a good day.

Bitpay was one of the many companies trying to hijack control of the bitcoin repo.  Their push for S2X was reckless and they used it as propaganda to attack the original chain so they could promote their centralized coin.  They were bought out by bitmain and it threatens the entire ecosystem when the same party aims to control the mining, service providers, and in the case of S2X and bcash the code. 
They provide a service but give inaccurate information to trick users while using it.  It is malicious and it's being used to gain more control of the ecosystem.

I lost about $100, this shouldn't have been released on mainnet literally doesn't work at all.

You can short bitcoin outside exchanges and have it settled in dollars on CME.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:16:11
have you found a resolution for the closing uncooperative issue?
I'm having the same problem. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:27:14
yeah that too taxes kept me acting conservative
