Depends on the users needs. My mother's pc was starting to run slow with their windows XP and I couldn't find drivers to reinstall it \- so I put linux mint on top of it. While they could use it after a few hours of training she still never got as fast as with windows. plus the lack of a real MS Office hurt her a lot as openoffice looked very different back at the time. Yes this got better, but you still have the problems of too many options. If I install her some linux, which one would i go for? mint? ubuntu? kubuntu? xubuntu? suse? fedora? which office suite should i install? libre office? openoffice? the standard thing that comes with the distribution? Will it be 100&amp; compatible with the word files she gets from her other teachers? Will she need to tell them that they get an ODT file back, instead of an docx?
As I said in the comment below, what lacks on linux is continuity. This is hurting them more than microsofts marketing. If my mum always used ubuntu she couldn't navigate on someones pc with suse on top of it. It is as different as macOS is from windows.
But of course, if someone just uses a browser and nothing else.. hell.. chrome OS might be enough.

Yeah just download the coinbase app and get started ;) seriously... If everyone would act like the guys in this thread bitcoin would still be like Linux: nice for nerds, but the common people wouldn't use it. Coinbase is a great entry point for everyone. I lost 0.6 btc because my private key went down on my nas when I reset my PC :)

... exactly what I said: Linux is for nerds.
Server admins are nerds, and yes linux makes a lot of sense there \- no doubt. I use it my own. But apart from that linux has major problems: The UI is vastly different from each distribution. And while h4xx0rs might like that, the common people need consistency. it SHOULD look like every other pc they ever used. Of course this is a problem caused by microsoft flooding the pc market in the first place, but even if linux had a bigger desktop market share to begin with \- switching from Mint to Ubuntu to Suse to Fedora is a HUGE change for non\-tech\-savy people.
So what did Android change? They made a plain simple UI where people couldn't do anything wrong. This is pretty much what coinbase does: Use the same technology, make it accessible to everyone.
