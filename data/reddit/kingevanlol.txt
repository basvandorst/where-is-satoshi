lol speaking in terms of widespread adoption beyond our little cryptocommunities, web wallets are the malt user friendly most likely to be used.
nearly all the non crypto-nerds that I know that have used or use Bitcoin do it strictly over the web. it is the most convenient and familiar as it is reminiscent of PayPal and online banking.
I can see a lite wallet being of utmost importance for those looking to store and save sizable wealth for investment or similar purposes, but for all other daily uses of cryptocurrencies web wallets and the like will suffice

The FBI already gave their explanation on how they did it. This guy just disagrees. As right (or wrong) as he may be, the FBI have already offered up their explanation, and this guy has just given a counter explanation. If he testified what he said in this write-up in court it would likely just be a matter for the jury/bench to choose what they believe to be accurate.

This is true. Anonymity is certainly a key factory when it comes to leaking information while trying to maintain personal safety  (I'm sure most others would share the same sentiment as well). However, it appears he already hinted at his future leaks and information under his real identity and you can't really backpedal from there. If the information came out now "anonymously", most anyone would know who to look at.
Also, if he spread word of the leaks and then leaked it anonymously/under a false identity or pseudonym, it raises questions of legitimacy. Many people will be hesitant to believe the information as a result. Look at twobitidiot leaks for example and how the public reacted to those.
Anonymous leaks work well when a trusted intermediate releases them though. WikiLeaks would be a good example of this, or even when a writer for a publication like the New York Times. They are typically able to validate the information coming from an anonymous source which adds legitimacy it typically would not have otherwise.

I understand the worry, especially when your identity as the whistleblower is publicly available and well known. Would be a different the leaks were delivered anonymously, but unfortunately thats not the case.
I can only speak for myself, but I would also be hesitant about leaking information regarding people who have a lot of money to lose as a result of the leak.Even more so when we are talking about a currency that can be used anonymously in more ways than I want to think about..

~~Not really, as far as I've read there is nothing to indicate cracking. Hacking would honestly be more accurate.~~ I don't know why a bunch of people clearly not involved in netsec get their panties in a bunch about what is and what is not "hacking". The worst offenders are those that insist most acts are "cracking" rather than "hacking", as if the former is a lesser form of the latter.
EDIT: Upon further investigation, it appears they were not hacked but were rather the victim of someone VERY POORLY exploiting a hole that could have possibly lead to further intrusion. The fact that a comment was able to break anything on the page likely means they are running some very poorly written/implemented comment system that does not have proper input sanitization. Such holes often lead to things like persistent XSS which can be very dangerous if exploited skilfully.

You realize that is a completely legitimate reason. If it threatens Stripes entire business to accept payments from bitcoin related companies as a result of the pressure from the banks (that make their business possible, mind you) then it makes perfect sense to ban those companies to protect their business and existing customers.
I know a lot of you are going to say something ridiculous like "well they should stand up to the banks if they really support bitcoin". If that is what you are thinking then you are so far out of line with what it means to operate a business in the real world.
@_date: 2014-07-23 03:04:13
Lets be realistic CoinShovel.. Stripe is a pretty huge player now in the payment processing market and they need to be buddies with these banks for their business to work. It is not easily and perhaps not even possible to maintain the same level of service if they cut their ties with these banks. You can not reasonably expect them to risk the rest of their business just to accept a handful of Bitcoin related customers.
With said said, you nor I have any idea how hard they may have or may not have tried to convince their partners to allow them to work with bitcoin related businesses without being seen as a risk. We simply do not know. However, I would personally speculate that they have tried to some degree. Though in all honesty I do not think Stripe is more of than a blip on the radar for these huge banks and that trying to convince them would be futile.

One of the main benefits to bitcoin, in many peoples eyes, is that chargebacks and all that are not possible. Not saying I agree with that or anything but just throwing it out there.
While sites that cater services and products that have high value definitely deserve some scrutiny and vetting, I don't think its particularly fair to write them off. I mean that's simply the nature of the travel industry as you noted a couple replies ago.
Destinia is not even the first bitcoin travel company, I'm pretty sure there is another one that allows you automate buying a hotel and airline tickets etc while paying with bitcoin.

Nope. Just the countdown and timer has to be completely removed from the web short of communicating with the public server, with the private server IP being impossible to locate short of hacking the public facing website's server.
That and have alternative ways to check the countdown. Perhaps another public server thats very low tech, only respoding to requests with the number of seconds left down on the timer. Would be more difficult to DDoS a server with such small bandwidth foot print (assuming it was a bandwidth based ddos). I would also encourage people to record the donation address so that donations could continue throughout the DDoS, and make it part of the script so that the donations to reset the timer are just about negligible amount of coin compared to normal donations so that people can easily fight to keep it going during DDoS attacks. Or the script could simply be paused during such attacks. The former might be a good option during attacks that do not take down the entire site, but perhaps slow it down enough to affect peoples strategy at the very least.

As the CEO of kraken said, then dont give it to the crypto company. Give it directly to the trustee appointed by the Japanese court. If you wont even do that I think you are being a little ridiculously paranoid over...something..

Uhhh if thats your opinion, then are most bitcoin marketplaces and gaming websites (casinos etc) all scams in the making? Anything that you send your coins to could scam you. There almost always has to be some level of trust somewhere in a bitcoin service
@_date: 2015-04-24 07:46:46
Unless I am misunderstanding the risk for a scam lies with a the player, unless that is what you meant by operator. If that is the case I apologize, to me operator just sounds like it implies the operator of the service/website as opposed to the player or consumer.
If you are saying these smart contacts could protect players, could you very short explanation on what these contracts are and how they would help mitigate risk?
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:55:30
Could someone explain something to me? I think I'm missing something big here in how this kind of game would operate.
Games like this and work because web technology has progressed to the point where one visitor can press a button and the results can be propagated to all other vistors in REAL TIME (e.g. a countdown resetting).
How would this work with the bitcoin in regards to confirmations. If donations are immediately counted, just as button presses are on doesn't that mean people will be able to do a lot of hanky-panky with the system because the counter is being reset from donations before even a single confirmation has taken place (hell, it will be reset nearly as soon as the transaction is detected in this case)?
In the alternative scenario, doesn't waiting for confirmations, or god forbid MULTIPLE confirmations, make this style of game completely worthless. The fun of the is, you sit there and wait knowing everyone else is watching the same thing but you want to hold out just long enough to be the first person to reset it before anyone else does. With confirmations its basically a shit show because there will literally be no accurate way to determine when your donation will go to reset the timer. It will literally be a lottery.
Is there something I'm missing? Either way to approach it seems game-breaking. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 07:43:28
Sorry I just read my original reply and it came of shitty so I edited it a little. Just wanted to apologize for that. I just thought it was incredibly vague because you make mention to feedback regarding the website without offering any specific stand-out examples.
By your logic any website selling high value products or services are not congruent with bitcoin because you have to trust them with your money (similar to how you would on any normal non-bitcoin high value transaction website???). Unless I am mistaken in the understanding of the first paragraph and first clause of the second parapraph of your post


Ergo it is not a terrible idea to not give blind trust to them,
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:10:55

@_date: 2013-05-17 06:13:28
Notifications of law changes that would affect a large number of businesses and industries do happen. There is usually a fair period of time before a law is passed and due to be active, giving businesses ample time to adjust accordingly; which again is the duty of a company to keep up to date with and insure measures are taken so that they are in compliance when the laws/regulations start to be enforced.
Often times these changes are very simple to make just require some basic paperwork to be filed and submitted. Not often (I can't think of any off the top of my head) do new industry regulations and laws come to pass where ample  time is not provided to allow businesses to make the changes needed for compliance.
EDIT: If you can provide any examples of this was not the case, where regulations came to pass and ample time to comply was not provided for companies within the affected industries was not given and subsequently resulted in action being taken, I would be very interested in seeing them if you had anything to show me. I am legitimately curious and I am in no way trying to be rude, argumentative, etc.

Can you name an exchange where the low-fee is purely what caused it to close down? A low fee exchange would surely succeed if it proved to be easier and more efficient than other exchanges currently on the market.  An exchange would only close if it could not reach the volume required to sustain a low fee; this inability would be a symptom of a larger issue.
Regarding specifically the security and infrastructure part, a startup typically has those two aspects covered by VC funding. Security would also be much cheaper as a result of the exchanges open source nature.

I am no expert in this nor am I even in the industry, though I do not think the problem lies within what state you may be operating within. I know there are some states that are better than others for this sort of business; though I was mostly referring to the federal laws and regulation that would apply regardless of state.
With that said, I appreciate you getting back to me on this. I truly hope that you succeed in getting this service up off the ground and running. If done right, this could be groundbreaking for the bitcoin community by making the market much more accessible to the average not-so-technology-savvy consumer that would otherwise find great difficulty in entering the market.
Thanks again for what you are doing.
