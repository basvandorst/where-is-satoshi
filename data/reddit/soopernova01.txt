Look, I'm gonna be honest here. This subreddit is probably the worst place of all to ask such a question, but here's my opinion:
You've mentioned you're on a tight budget, and you're a college student. Investing in Bitcoin, a highly volatile currency, is not something you want to do right now. I mean, sure, if you've got $100 lying around and you're not afraid of losing a bit of money, go ahead. If that's not the case, though, I think you'd be better off investing in a hedge fund of some sort. They're way more secure and though you may not win the lottery doing that, that's okay, cause that's not the point of investing.
But hey, who am I to judge? At least if you're gonna be buying Bitcoin, sell for the amount you bought at some point. This will ensure you don't go out of the investment having *lost* money (not accounting for inflation, of course).

So my keys are like passwords, then?  What are hardware wallets?

MY OPINION:
Stop trying to beat the market. You'll fail. You're gonna invest in something where the value will rise significantly anyway, don't get greedy.

No, Bitcoin isn't crashing, most likely at least. Over the past year or half, there has been controversy in the community about how Bitcoin should operate, and now the different sides might split off, creatibg new currencies. As long as you keep your keys private, and don't do any transactions between 30th, and until the dust settles down sometime in August, you should be fine.
New to Bitcoin myself, but this is the best way I can explain it RN.
Best ways to keep your keys private are hardware wallets, but if you don't have one, get a paper wallet.
