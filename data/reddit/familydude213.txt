I wish I knew the other parts but any gains or losses need to be submitted to the IRS when doing taxes, Short term gains( less than 1 year) can range form 10-39%, and long term gains (1 year plus) are subject to 20% Depending on if your actively moving money around and selling or just HODLing make sure you keep track of it all

I don't like telling people what to do with their money, but I don't belive BCH will see the continued succsess for long

biggest problem on coinbase I've seen so far is traffic crashes, about a week ago when prices were all over the place coinbase crashed left and right preventing sales and purchases of LTC and BTC and ETH

Hard to say if you watch it can be a roller coaster, I'd keep charts on your desktop and watch for drastic up ticks, once price reached an all time high, You'll see people freak and sell. Thats the time to buy.

 I have a feeling like over 100 years from now there will be a new form of currency... Bitcoin is still in it's infancy.

GDAX is rad, however crashes at spikes, when it hit 19.4k last week everything stopped just have another way of selling if your using it.

Seriously thanks dude, I'm watching people buy sell and trade which I'm totally cool with my question is are they recording their short term gains and reporting them.

Yes follow the trends and attempt your best to buy at the dip
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:45:11
You can short it good luck sir!

It's a first to market, newer technology has come in that is better, but generally the public is under educated, the money is allocated by each individual, it's kinda a catch 22, people may know theres better alt coins, however newbies buying into bitcoin cause prices to rage.

I started immediatly with coinbase today. So far so good!

Some people can't afford to put in large sums of money, others are just in it to see whats up how it works and more

retract my statement maybe it was a fluke when loading the first time.

Step three: Regret not actually getting in on the dip then read the forums frantically while bitcoin prices dip, see other people that did the same and HODL for the ultimate reward.
