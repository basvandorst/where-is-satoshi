My head tells me to hodl. But my gut says sell now and buy later and make a few extra quid. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:49:08
That made sense! Thank you for the reply. Was just a curious little thing I noticed that I needed educating on haha. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:37:36
I bought my first bitcoin Wednesday night for £8000. By the time I'd authorised the payment on the phone it had dropped £2k haha. At the moment I'm happy just hodling it!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:05:37
This is exactly what made me think of the idea in the first place. When it hits 11k USD I'd expect many people to sell and the price drop a considerable amount. My idea was sell now, wait for the drop and buy back in a few houndred quid lower. But as pointed out already thinking it would be that simple would more than likely be a mistake.

Those sell "walls" lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:24:36
I sold twice just before 9k and again when it jumped back up. Made over £1k yesterday alone. That being said there have been times when I've nearly sold and haven't got whatever reason and those wins would easily have become losses.

Told my mrs I was about to sell at £9000 and buy back in when it dipped. She talked me out of it and 10 seconds later it dipped nearly £500. I could kick her in the vag. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:23:57
I had this dilemma last week. Had the cash to buy a full coin and was waiting for the dip, it got to the point where I decided a dip wasn't coming so I bought in. It dipped less than a minute later losing 25% of my investment. If I'd have waited another few minutes I could have bought in a lot lower. Luckily though 4 days later I'm now 10% up. Would have been nice to catch that dip though. Either way you'll profit wether you buy now or wait.

Been watching the order book a lot recently and I've noticed the same sell orders undercutting each other by a penny very quickly. I'm guessing this is some sort of bot/program?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:56:35
Transfer cash to gdax. Limit buy = no fees? I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:22:13
Unless it's across your arse and the O being the anus and you being a hot female willing to show us afterwards it's a pretty shit move. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:49
We had a 25% dip this time last week.

Just want to visit the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:09
I think it could make the price of bitcoin go up, stay the same or go lower.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:05:41
Coinbase in GBP is always a few hundred quid lower than gdax not higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:48:32
I sat all last week with £8000 waiting for a dip then it hit me, there wasn't one coming. Less than 30 seconds after buying 1btc it dropped £2000 I shit you not.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:17:03
Rules my theory out then haha. Thanks again
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:22:28
Been waiting for a month? Unless you're stevie wonder there's no excuse for you to have not bought in yet. I think you missed the train, I'd get on now before it picks up speed. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:15:29
£800 gets you 2 weeks all inclusive in Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica etc. It's enough for a nice break. I'm British though, Fuck knows how much you yanks have to spend.

I'm sure one of those options is smart but I can't decide which one. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:36:26
Sorry I think my question may have been worded to cause confusion. 
On both USD and GBP stats it shows there is a huge wall of people with sell orders  and a very small amount have buy orders waiting. 
The Europeans however have hardly any sell wall at all and it has a huge army of people with buy orders.  See pic below 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:52:11
Purchase when you're ready. People say wait for a dip but sometimes they don't come and sometimes you're in one without realising. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:20:16
Somebody on a forum gave me a bitcoin worth £440 last year. I sold it at £600. Was a good move at the time, not so much now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:04:04
If you've been waiting for a good time to buy in, this is it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:10
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:42:14
Thanks for the advice. It does sound way too easy which is why it won't be. It's not a mistake I'm willing to make anytime soon, if at all. Was just something I'd been wondering about!
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:33:51
Thanks for the reply. Was just a theory but something I'll certainly keep in mind!
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:11:46
Some fellow Brits selling some decent amounts this evening. Seen a fair few 10-15btc walls and now there's a 20btc wall. All single sell orders too. Just appear out of nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:10
Let's have a little bet, if the price of bitcoin is lower on Monday than it is now I'll give anyone who bets against me a full coin. If it's higher though I'll expect a coin back ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:11:42
Bought in at £8,089 and by the time I'd hung up the phone from my bank asking for authorisation it had dropped about £2000. Yes I shit myself, but it's all ok now thanks to this sub constantly reminding me to HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:57
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:00
That was the best ride I've ever been on. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:10
Can't wait to buy this dip 
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:59:34
I watched the market for about 2 weeks waiting for a big drop. Wasn't happening so I bought in. It dropped £2000 by the time the sale confirmed. 2 days later it's back higher than when I bought in! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:14:39
We get random placed walls such as £8970, $12,000 is much easier on the eyes haha
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:54:12
Scratching my head thinking a holiday for 0.1? Then the math kicked in and 0.1 is actually a lot. Just don't see it when dealing with larger numbers. Well done. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:57:11
At the current prices it's almost £100 cheaper to buy a bitcoin in Euros than GBP. 
Is it possible maybe people are buying in euros and selling in GBP for instant profit? Hence nobody selling in EURO currency. Or is there exchange/fees etc that would make it less worthwhile
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:33
And brits at 9k

When you put a silly buy order in and it actually fills. Haha win. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:04:11
I bought the dip, well at least I thought I did. That fucker dropped even further 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:36:59
Aaaaand it's gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:31
all these dumb dums still selling their coins. I'd hate to feel the regret that's about to overcome you after the weekend.

You've got it all wrong. You have to buy them high in India and send them to my wallet and I'll sell them low. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:23:32
I waited for a dip for about a week, didn't come so I bought straight into the full coin club. It dipped nearly £2000 less than 10 seconds after confirming my purchase haha. It was almost as sickening as the thought of selling my coins last year. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:57:33
I'll have my mrs suck you off if it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:44:25
What happens if you neee to sell? Having it in the exchange allows you to make sales instantly, having to transfer it from a wallet to the exchange can take time. Just wondering. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:01
I bought in at 11k gbp again. And at the time I was laughing. Now not so much 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:13:31
I was just about to pay a big 5 figure loan off after selling a car, decided to fire it all into bitcoin instead. 7 days later I've paid the loan off and I've still got what I put into bitcoin. Luck was on my side but it was a stupid thing to do, paid off though. I could afford the loan payments if something went wrong. Question is can you?

Without a doubt, crazy 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:25
Something tells me you'll be able to buy back in soon.

Math isn't your strong point huh?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:45
Bought my first bitcoin at £8080, my bank called to verify the transaction and when I put the phone down it dropped to just over £6000. 
Safe to say I shit myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:23:32
Localbitcoins is shit at the minute. Everytime I go to buy the seller goes into vacation mode and then a second later they're back with higher prices. It's happened 4 times now with different sellers. The price is changing too quickly for them to keep up.
