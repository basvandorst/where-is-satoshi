Not necessarily true.
What if you generate your own electricity from renewable sources?

I apologize, I stand corrected. I didn't realize they hadn't included those.
As far as I understand, it does however still include people on subsidized flextidsjob, praktik, and the such.

I agree it doesn't matter when a general user uses it. But when a journalist uses it, it makes them look amateurish.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:03:00
Could you further expand on that please? I'm not entirely sure I understand what you're saying.

Ahem, but our "tiny island" (actually we have quite a lot of mainland, but that's besides the point) is working incredibly fine for us. LA might be very socialist to you, but to us it's still a step backwards.
To give an example you might grasp: Say there was a proposal in the US to add (more, actually) limits to the first amendment. A Chinese person might say "Ridiculous they're calling that authoritarian, it still massively protects free speech".

Yes, I'm well aware it originated as the The Onion Router, that name however hasn't been officially used in almost 10 years. So when a journalist writes TOR, it means they've put no effort into researching Tor.

While nothing like what you suggested (IMHO it's better), a niche PGP email replacement has already (sorta) been made.

I can't tell if they're serious or not.

1 &amp; 2 aren't solutions for online wallets/other services that require having a copy of the blockchain.
How would  help?

Not Ayn Rand's version, that's for sure.

1) I'm unfamiliar with law enforcement, I have no idea if it'd be illegal, but there's no way SR would have your IP.
2) Again, it doesn't. The concern is that when you order something there, you have to write your real address. If SR was somehow accessed by law enforcement, they could get your information if you hadn't encrypted it with PGP, or LE could turn the website into a honeypot (if it got seized)
What (supposedly) happened here is that a misconfiguration on the SR websites server accidentally caused SR to send a bunch of information, including SR's real IP, to the users. Thereby allowing anybody who got this information to find the real location of SR.

I'm just curious, what would you consider the difference between an online wallet and a real bank?
@_date: 2013-07-09 14:25:54
I know, I gotta stop picking fights with random people on the internet.

Oh boo hoo. The Scandinavian model is the best currently functioning government in place in the entire world.
Firstly, your claims. 800.000 living off welfare? There are just under 200.000 living off kontanthjælp, if that's what you mean by welfare checks. If not, what did you mean?
Taxation level is the highest, so what?


Please do elaborate. The first point sounds like utter bullshit, and the second is (as far as I know) irrelevant to Denmark.


Actually it's [less than 180%]( (progressive tax,) and why is that a problem?


This is entirely new to me, and according to [this]( there's zero regulation on what they're allowed to put into cigarettes (granted that's not exactly what you said, but I'm very interested in a source/explanation for that point.)


Absolutely first I've ever heard of that, and not able to find any source backing it up.


How is this a problem? It prevents tenants from getting screwed over. Do you have a specific complaint/problem with regards to this?

Whether it's profitable or not really depends on how much electricity costs for you.
Generally speaking, unless you have free electricity, or are a commercial miner, you'll be operating at a loss.

It's Tor, not TOR. Those kind of mistakes just make it seem like they have no idea what they're talking about.
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:06:54
Why is that?

The challenge is to guess them, not bruteforce them. They're using commonly used insecure passwords, guess which ones ~~(looks like somebody got an other one, "boobs")~~ Nvm, I'm stupid

That includes pension and SU.

Nope. You'd have to rely on one of the exit nodes keeping logs AND being willing to give you their info (both very unlikely.) Then you'd need to get the two relays he used as well to do the same (double unlikely.) Then you'd have to hope he's not behind a VPN. And that's just to get his real IP, then you'd have to track him specifically with that info.
Knowing which exit node he's coming from won't tell you anything, if it were, Tor would be useless.

Well, I don't really know much about economic theory or whatever, which is why I asked.
But I would think interest to not be possible while bitcoin is deflationary. I haven't read their website, but I'd assume insurance on desposits to be a given too, they don't provide that? Obviously they'd need some safe checks as well, to cancel suspicious transactions.

Well, preventing spam wasn't the main purpose behind it.
But it does include a hashcash system to prevent spam.

In the first case he had it in his glove compartment, not the trunk. In the second it didn't say where the knife was, plus he was headed to a club.
They both got a fine.
I'm not trying to defend these cases. I don't believe people should be driving around with knives anywhere except in the trunk, but I agree they shouldn't be arrested and tried for it. However if this is the best example of restrictive laws you've got, then you're just making a case for the Scandinavian model.
