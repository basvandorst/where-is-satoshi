Well, it depends on how you gift Bitcoin. One of the main advantages of visa gift cards is that they have a physical form, which makes it a great gift. People prefer to get presents with a physical value.
If you would send Bitcoin to someone’s wallet, it wouldn’t be a great gift, because people don’t like virtual gifts. To solve this there are paper wallets. Send bitcoin to them and give it away. A couple of months ago, I was also looking to gift someone some crypto, but I couldn’t find a way to do it. Paper wallets felt too cheap. I came up with CryptCards. They are plastic ‘cold wallets’ and the receivers of the gifts really liked them. Eventually I started selling them on my site, you can learn more about them on  .
They are available as pre-loaded cards or empty. It is also possible to buy a wallet with your own wallet address. Contact me if you’re interested!

Hi, the pre-loaded BTC cards atart at $108 because of high transaction fees atm. Once those drop, I will lower the minimum amount of BTC (on pre-loaded cards)

We are a company registred at the dutch chamber of commerce and have a clear terms and conditions. If anything happens you can sue us. It is a matter of trust, what I do with them is my choice. When I make a wallet at coinbase they can acces my funds, if I have a bittrex account they can run away with my funds. I like the idea of a giftcard, that’s why I started developing them!

That is why I am offering LTC and ETH cards! To answer your question: you have to trust me. To create this trust I try to be as transparant as possible about my company. I’m registred at the dutch Chamber of Commerce (kvk.nl) you can find me by searching CryptCard or CSSdsign (parent company). I also wrote in my Terms and Conditions that I’ll delete all private keys, if I don’t delete them, you can sue me!

I developed CryptCards for occasions like xmas where you want to gift crypto to others. They are plastic ‘paper wallets’, every card has its own public address and QR-code printed on it. I have my family and friends some ETH and LTC. The private keys were on a cardholder. Told everyone that they should NOT forget or lose their private keys. 
Everyone loved it and they were all super interested in the tech behind it. Some of them are going to buy some more crypto now! I hope they will pass on their crypto interest to other friends. 
Btw: I also sell my CryptCards on  (feedback is welcome, just started the business)

It will definitely have an effect on the market. The little traders will lose alot of money. I got rekt this morning when bithumb went down and lost 10% of my stack.

What if the only reason he is moving his btc to bitfinex is to manipulate the market? People are thinking he will buy bch with it --&gt; prices go up --&gt; Ver has profit.

One word: BITHUMB
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:33
He isn't going to sell his BTC. He is trying to create market speculation, people buying into BCH because they think Roger Ver is going to buy 100k BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:54:55
The whole BCH pump was coordinated from Korea. Almost 50% of the volume came from BitHumb. I made my profit, but then saw that BCH went on another parabolic run and re entered. Unfortunately bithumb went down and the price immidiately dropped because of the loss of volume.

No, litebit.eu wasn’t hacked. Some scammer send you an email from a random mailadres (mail That is definitely not from litebit. They are after people like you who would fall for this kind of scam by thinking its from litebit. This was a phishing attempt and a really bad one. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:47:26
If you knew it was fake, why did you post two time that LiteBit was hacked?
