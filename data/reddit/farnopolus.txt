We're boycotting coinbase until they implement segwit

I would have done better in Bitcoin but now I'm so far under water I really need them to regain a lot

Be your own bank; carry your own protection...

The fraudulent part is calling Bcash bitcoin

That's a sick dude

You eat sh*t you're either sick or going to be sick

Working my way to all bitcoin; waiting for 3 shitcoins  to get back into profit first...
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:30:12
Nope...consensus rules

Look at it this way; you haven't lost unless you sell at a loss. It's tough to watch but it may go down a lot farther before it comes back up. Just improve your average by buying more as it drops. It will most likely double from what you paid within a year...

What I mean is the consensus is behind Bitcoin as it is now; newcomers that are fooled into buying Bcash are being deceived by Roger Ver and his cronies

Oh yeah I forgot about that; coinbase giving Bcash a chance to get entrenched I guess
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:10:36
I wasn't worried too much about Bcash until lately a lot of u tubers are starting to support it or at least they are holding both in case. I can't figure them out because it seems pretty obvious to me that there is an all out attack on bitcoin right now. These are smart guys too

Anyone see it re testing 1300? It never did...
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:46:41
They keep getting asked about something they are clueless about; why is it the media will not seek out the leaders and experts in Bitcoin for interviews?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:53:28
Alts only good if they enable a person to buy more bitcoin; right on dude
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:36:09
Yes; it goes up news or no news; simply new money coming in at an increasing rate. I'm expecting seven thousand in the next week for no good reason lol

If you are in profit you didn't screw up. However  I think you would do well to sell your ETH into bitcoin right now; I sold my 10 ETH into bitcoin because I believe ETH will not reach the levels bitcoin will reach. I also believe that 6000 or under will be considered a good buy for bitcoin very soon.

As Richard Heart says "wall street money is coming; and it's not coming for alt coins, it's coming for Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:50:05
You would be supporting segregated witness (A very good thing ) but not segwit2x if that is what you mean; segwit2x is the hardfork coming up that we want to avoid but everyone needs to support segregated witness which is very good for bitcoin and was implemented in august
