The main benefit of bitcoin is that once your funds are in bitcoin you are your own bank - in other words, you are directly and totally in control of your funds, and can do whatever you want with them. Money in your traditional bank account is not really yours, it's just a loan you have given to the bank hoping that they will pay you back.
And of course you do not have to meet somebody in person to use bitcoin. All the problems you describe arise from wanting to use credit cards or fiat - which are not bitcoin.
