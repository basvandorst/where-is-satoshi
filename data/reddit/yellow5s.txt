'Satoshi' is more than likely a state or a group.
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:41:49
It will turn out to be a group  funded by a Government.  
There is no way this was an individual who just shat Bitcoin in to existence and then ran away. 
No way that is more realistic than simply a state backed project.
What states would want Bitcoin? Well...who would want to destabalise  America? The list is long.
I firmly believe they're playing the long game  and we have seen nothing yet.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:39:53
So what point are you making? 
It's the most powerful country on the planet.  
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:51:51
I didn't say it was, that's your assumption. 
I simply implied that there were states who would benefit from a destabilised U.S and I know its a bitcoin forum but don't try to undermine the importance of the dollar. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:27:04
is this forum anything other than pro-bitcoin articles? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:41:51
Why? If a sub on one of the largest forums on the Internet is 95 percent spin then is that not an indication of bitcoin as a whole? 
There are almost 180,000 subscribers here [probably way, way more than the number of people using Bitcoin every day] but the discussion is very limited and most of the activity is simply articles being pasted from other sites. All pro-bitcoin, of course. 
That rings alarm bells.

Why has this arc been ramped non-stop for the last  few days? There will be a reason.

@_date: 2015-12-23 10:04:19
Fuck off, America.

You don't do *anything* with a corporation unless you have a contract.
If you expected 25,000 then put it in your contract.

If nobody knows who  he is then nobody knows he even exists as an individual. It could just as easily have been a group, a Government etc
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:22:45
Well it isn't that hard to be honest.
Betfair has more  transactions a day than all European stock exchanges combined
But a revenue of under 400m a year
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:07:53
Conspiracy? 
My opinion is just as valid as your opinion. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:43:24
If it's such a great idea then  it should sell itself without constant ramping from the media.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:14:58
Oh look another shameless bitcoin ramp.
If you all have to try so brutally hard to convince yourself bitcoin is so valuable then you may want to take a couple of steps back.

Why has this arc been  ramped non-stop for the last few days? There will be a reason.
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:35:03
Because this sub is almost nothing but pro-bitcoin articles written by pro-bitcoin pseudo-media. There is next to no original content it is all just ramp ramp ramp. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:58:56
On betting exchanges like Betfair  when a team is a 'sure thing' and everybody is going to back them in guess what the smarts do...oppose them. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 10:14:04
I highly doubt the story we have been fed about 'Satoshi' is true. It's just smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:02:56
It isn't going anywhere where it hasn't already been.  
This happens all the time on Betting Exchanges;
'Team A is drifting omggggg lay them quick, someone knows something.'
Erm...no...the price is simply going  back to where it was before it got smashed in, which is perfectly natural and means little unless you think you can guess a market. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:28:58
Intelligent, forward thinking individuals and groups play the long game.
A few years isn't very long.  
I would bet the group  that owns these coins has more faith in Bitcoin than this sub which is fueled almost entirely by articles and posts ramping up bitcoin. 
They most likely have a far different end game, one that doesn't rely on constant ramping to keep Bitcoin relevant. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:32:54
So how do you spend it? 
@_date: 2015-11-12 08:10:19
They'll just make it a crime not to hand over the pass like they did in the UK.
@_date: 2015-11-21 11:31:28
You're right and this is why they want to control and regulate our information and communications - so that we don't stab the problem in the heart...
@_date: 2015-11-11 18:33:29
if I ever have kids that's what they're getting instead of a NERF gun
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:53:42
Oh yes, just whip out the magic 'terrorism' or 'peadophile' word and Joe Public bends over.
I *despise* these parasites. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:53:00
Obama got one so you better believe it's fixable.
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:43:50
The American Government aims to punish people and seeks revenge. Justice isn't anywhere near their list of priorities, they're a few hundred years behind in that respect. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 09:38:02
As the flow of wealth and power flows to fewer and fewer people the control that the parasites and their corporate sponsors exert over the population increases. It has to. And so it's happening right now. Right now we are being strangled a little more and nobody does a damn thing about it and in a short time we'll be completely owned and ruled by faceless, answerless entities and people will look back on now and say 'why the hell didn't they drag those parasites out the back and stop it?'
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:04:52
or gay boys
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:25:16
Less than half...
 What percentage of those people were taking pot luck guesses? 100 percent? 
So file this under 'shameless ramp' 
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:04:27
Spot on.
