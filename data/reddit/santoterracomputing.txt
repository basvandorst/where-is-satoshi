Santo Tera is part of my private company, so yea not going to share my tax return lol. My rent is $450/mo, but I also rent part of building I dont use to a neighbor business for $300/mo.  Everybody always talks about fixed costs, but I dont see much fixed costs. I did have to invest in some infrastucture and startup costs like PDUs, good Power Supplies, I also had to get the state of Washington to permit my electrical (that was rediculous) and I had to build a heat exchange box to vent the heat out in the summer. But now it just hums right a long with very little overhead costs. So as long as the machines are 50-80% margin everything looks good. I think most people that try to ASIC mine have no business experience or electrical engineering or data server experience and they make lots of mistakes with overkill and poor decisions. I have already made my investment in setup back and currently I am just letting it spin out cash. Probably the hardest part is resisting the desire to expand further (spend profit) with more S17s, and scale up again. Maybe in September. Maybe not.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:51:47
Its probably the implementation of AsicBoost by Bitmain. I upgraded all my S9s and got 28% effeciency improvement.
The more important take away from this chart is the 20-30% gross profit margin increase of the new Asic Miners from Bitmain. If you have ever run a cash flow positive business this is very substantial. If price of BTC falls too far, I would keep the 15 and 17s running and shut down the S9s

Its not that simple. When the price drops, and miners stop mining because they get scared, hash rate will also drop, and difficulty will also drop and then more bitcoin can be mined with same equipment because it takes less hash rate to obtain a block reward. Its a risk-reward situation. I personally would continue to mine through a prolonged bear market even at a loss because I have cash reserves. I might turn off my older less efficient machines and keep my newer machines hashing. Would I mine at a loss for 5-10 years? No. 1 year? Yes. So for me, I would start to sweat if the price of BTC crashed to about $1500. But I dont think we will ever see it that low ever again. I could be wrong though. No Risk, No Reward.

I also have invested in a small mining farm. Its profitable above 5000. I am long on Bitcoin and I can afford to lose my investment. I believe in the long term vision of a digital currency vs fiat. It will take time though. How do you know Fidelity isnt already buying and selling for its clients?

I understand the technology. Probably better than most. Because of volatility and being a brand new asset class and a brand new financial technology the price and market cap is the best measure of project maturity and potential for future success. Investors, speculators, venture capitalists, whales, governments, regulators - they are all watching the price trends of the projects. The only people who say “dont focus on price” are people financially and emotionally invested in a project where the price is either falling or not growing as expected.

Coupons expire in 30 days. They gave me one because of previous purchases. I used it when the S17s first went live for sale on their website. Unfortunately, they sold out in about five minutes. I managed to get ONE!
What is happening is they are selling them in 100, 500 and 1000 qtys to large mining operations. So you have to get a pre-order deal done with them before they release on their website. I am working this relationship myself now. No, I will not share the details with you. lol

This is all accurate. However, an asset is “traded.” This creates liquidity for its investors. An asset that is not traded will loose its value. Gold is traded on the open market because the world accepts it has value. Stocks are traded on the open market. Real Estate is bought and sold on the open market. Hodlers hold Bitcoin hoping to sell it one day for a gain. Today, Bitcoin is more like gold than a global currency. Can Bitcoin one day become a global currency? Of course. But first it has to be accepted worldwide as a store of value. Who knows, maybe Bitcoin will be the backing asset for hundreds of other digital currencies.

Bitcoin has the only real “use case” so far. As a potential replacement for gold as a store of value and backing for any currency. Its currently at $200 Billion compared to gold at approx $7 trillion. If Bitcoin can remain secure and reach 1$ trillion valuation, gold will start to loose its value and the next generation will have no problem trusting math and digital. Central banks and governments cannot stop Bitcoin. Defend the Network! Keep it secure! Join the revolution!!!

This table shows the gross profit margins per miner of actual Slushpool payout rates based in todays Price of BTC. So this includes change in difficulty over time. The difficulty was actually falling in Nov/Dec/Jan and then started to rise as price bottomed and began to rise in Feb/Mar timeframe. The chart is intended to measure Gross Profit Margin as a percentage of Sales. This helps me measure the health of the business.

Bitcoin is scare because of its monetary policy fixed into the math/code of the bitcoin blockchain software. It cant be changed. A maximum of 21 million coins is the total supply that will ever be created. The mining reward is “halved” every 4 years. It is estimated that the last bitcoin will be mined near the year 2140. So every 4 years it gets harder and harder to mine a new coin. Its similar to real gold in that it is believed most of the gold on the planet has been mined already, so finding some new gold is very rare, difficult, costly and valuable to obtain. Mining Bitcoin will also get harder and harder making it more and more scarce over time. So your perception of creating Bitcoin without a problem is mis-guided. I spent $20,000 on my small mining farm and now at current rates and difficulty its generating me approx $2500/mo in BTC and $1500/mo in hosting fees from other people who pay me to host their miners in my facility.
Also dont confuse the 10 yr old Bitcoin blockchain with other cryptocurrency blockchains that are copycats of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, BitcoinSV for example are all copys. Ethereum and XRP are blockchain “programming platforms” for creating cryptographic financial solutions of all sorts. This has value, but they are not Bitcoin. The problem they solve is different than Bitcoin. This is what the term altcoin means. Not Bitcoin.

Current US Tax law treats Crypto like property. So you pay capital gain tax on the increase when you sell. Like buying a house and then selling it for a gain.

Pretty sure there is no such thing as a mining node. You dont have to run a full node to run an ASIC miner. I do both and they are not connected. I think you can mine with bitcore full node software on your computer but that is not the same thing as using an ASIC miner designed specifically to hash the algorithm. Full nodes are used to confirm transactions on the blockchain network. ASIC miners are used to create new coins for circulation. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:41:09
We have 400 amps in the bldg right now. Each miner pulls 6.25amps (1.3kW). We will put 4 miners on each 30a circuit. So about 40 miners total or 52KWh x 24h x 30d = 37,445 kW /mo x 0.057 = $2134/mo in electricity. At 3500-4000 BTC our S9j’s (with asicboost) are making $60 to $90 a month or $2400 to $3600 a month in BTC. Of course, we expect next bull run soon so we are hodling at this time.

Well I have about $10k invested into my farm and spent 3 months $1200 getting state electrical permits because they freaked out and I had to send them to power science labs to prove they were safe and UL certified. I could easily config my clients miners to point to whatever pool they want which would be variable, but i suggest they use nicehash.com in slovenia because they are a marketplace and sell the hash to highest bidder. I use Ebay as a marketing tool to find new clients for other businesses. I also use Ebay as a price discovery tool to determine interest level. So far, no rental clients! laughing but over 500 views!!
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:55:24
I use nicehash.com. Is that a mining pool? I am an ASIC miner. It is my ASIC farm. I sell my SHA256 hash power to the highest bidder on nicehash marketplace. My hash is always sold out. I dont care what pool or coin uses my hash power. I get rewarded in BTC daily. Worldwide marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers together have proven to be very successful - ebay, ariba, allibaba, etc Its not important to me to run a full node for mining purposes.

I dont agree with that. The original design was intended to make it increasingly more difficult to mine to ensure scarcity much like how real gold is very rare and difficult to mine today. This is why the halvening every 4 years. The chip makers have to keep up (and they are) and the miners have to keep up also. Without this design, I would not have confidence and would not mine.

Our current rate is $0.057/kwh but we just doubled our demand which will put us at next rate tier which is $0.047/kwh
To help with the math - one S9 pulls 1300 watts at 220v or 6.25amps thats 1300 x 24hr x 30d x 0.057 = $53/mo and at 0.047 = $44/mo so in order to cover our costs we charge $60/mo for colo or rent-ours.

I understand. If you took the time to read my other reddit posts you would see this. Bitcoin is a protocol for money. Like HTML, HTTP, FTP and TC/IP are protocols for the Internet. They had to be accepted worldwide as standards and they are currently mananaged by consensus by the [W3C]( A consortium of people worldwide. Companys, Universities, Governments all depend on these standards to transact global communications. Of course, large companys and governments will want to influence these standards but its done by the W3C standards body. This community should study more about how the W3C does this.
“W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.”

Of course not, laughing. You pay up front for the build, amortize the cost of the capital equipment over 7-10 years. Then you are creating your own free electricity.

We find it important to note that even if these problems materialize, our outlook on Bitcoin remains optimistic. Bitcoin has the largest user base, the most widely respected supply distribution, and is increasingly integrated into financial infrastructure.

Mining is not the same as running a full node. Nodes manage traffic and replicate the blockchain for security. I have one node running in my farm. Mining confirms transactions solving the puzzle and minting new coins. There are already 500,000 plus miners running worldwide. We need more to support the growing number of user transactions. I specialize in SHA256 coin mining BTC, LTC and BSV.
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:24:22
NSA? The US National Security Agency? Oy Vei. Laughing.... Why would the US Govt want to create a global currency to compete with US Dollar? SHA256 is just a cryptographic algorithm, it can be used in any computer application. SHA256 is just a small part of the Bitcoin blockchain ecosystem.
Also, you dont understand the concept of a mining pool. A pool is just an aggregator, it enables individual miners like me to “team up” with other miners and combine our computing power to solve the SHA256 algorithm faster and in a smoother manner so we get daily payouts rather than waiting for 2 months to get the whole reward. The pool owner is just service for the thousands of miners who choose to use the pool. The miners can choose another pool or mine solo. So the network is NOT controlled by the pools.

Amazon is in the business to make money by selling infrastructure to cloud and data service clients. They focus on best of class data services. If pool companies or exchanges or large mining operations want to utilize AWS for infrastructure because of effeciencies of scale, why not? It would be really stupid business for Amazon to get involved with their own clients politics. Now, if Amazon wants to really be stupid and develop their own global currency, well they can try and fail. I suspect they will keep building value added services to their blockchain cloud services so they can keep their competitors like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle etc from taking their clients. That would be the smart thing to do.

Bitcoin is not going to zero. Just like real estate or gold is not going to zero. They might go up and down, but not to zero. Bitcoin is a new asset class which obviously you have no understanding of investing in assets. I have about 2% of my investments in Bitcoin at this time, and its kicking this shit out of all the others asset classes right now, ie- stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, silver, etc. So I am a happy camper.

I would not run these in a house. They are loud, produce heat and one miner uses as much electricity as one window air conditioning unit (1500 watts) running constantly. So imagine trying to run 9 window AC units non stop!? lol

Not really. Electric bill is averaging $250-300/mo. I took it all on a trip to Boise Idaho for my regular job in a suitcase, carved out a few days and have been running it remotely from Hawaii ever since. I have a local IT guy (who has a key to bldg) who checks on it once in a while for me. I use Teamviewer to remotely login to a PC and Arlo Security Cameras to remotely see inside and check on temperature etc. I plan to scale it up to 20 miners in next phase although I will probably use four S15s instead of ten more S9js.

You don't understand how to build a business or make investments. I invested in August 2018. I have made my investment back already with a nice profit and now I have a positive cash flow business as well. Of course its based on price. It is like investing in real estate. You buy, you hold. If it goes up you try to sell at the top. If it goes down, you sell and take the loss. You try to buy in a market that is going up. I believe Bitcoin is going up because of the halving and a lot of other factors. I understand the risk and I can afford to loose my investment. I don't appreciate being called an idiot. I have done quite well in my 60 years so far.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:09:53
Bitmain is staying ahead of the difficulty curve. The new machines are 3X more efficient. I am currently cash flow positive and have got all my investment back in 6 months. Of course, I am holding BTC, so if price crashes, my investment could go upside down. Same thing happens when you invest in real estate. You have to hold it and then sell it for a gain. But I also have hosting clients who rent my machines and that reduces my risk and pays the electric bill.

You are not putting a value on a sustainable cash flow positive business. If (and of course its a big if), the mining operation can consistently generate cash, then this business can also be sold to another bigger company. Buying BTC (which I do!) is a single transaction and has no future opportunity for equity or value increase. This is what venture capital investors, investment banks and angel investors do. Its called capitalism. They invest in companies, grow them and then sell them or take them public (which is still selling them just to thousands of stockholders)
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:00:58
There are many mining operations who take the “long view” they dont care about weekly or monthly fluctuations. They have investors betting on 3-5 year growth  plans. Of course, if the bitcoin network and value completely collapses for say a whole year, they will shut down operations and run out of capital. But this decision is not made in a day. Smart investors look at the “long view” Of course, operations with small budgets and low risk tolerance will capitulate first. I personally believe the new ASIC miners (S17) have effectively tripled effeciency and will take us thru the halvening. S9s will become obsolete. Sorry, thats how the cookie crumbles in any high tech business.

You are correct and it does work. This is true for every manufacturing/service business. You have to budget for replacing/upgrading equipment in order to stay ahead of your competition.

Antminer S9j. Bitmain.com Buy only direct from Bitmain in China. You need 220v not 110v. Each miner pulls 6.25 amps. Make sure you use 30a rated wiring and dont overload your circuits. Most homes in US only have one 220v outlet. I rented a small building that had 400 amps at the wall. So the max I can run is about 40to50 miners. I had electrician install multiple 220v outlets and I use multiple 30amp PDUs for every four miners. I also had to get state licensed electrical contractor and a permit to do a field evaluation before state regulators would approve the site. They are worried you will overload the circuits and start a fire. And of course they need to make money to justify their existance. lol

Yes it does, look closer. $450/mo. 
With regard to difficulty this is my Phase 2 upgrade plan
1) The new S15 ASIC is a 2X improvement in hash and effeciency. The cost of these will come down to $1000 my fully burdened projected cost for a miner is ~$500 so one S15=two S9s - so upgrade in phases
2) Add Solar to the building to reduce electricity costs. A single 1800watt 3 panel Solar Generator is $999 fnanced over 2 years is $25/mo so this could cut electric bill for one or two miners in half, its worth a try
3) These are additional investments that I believe will be very valuable during the next bull run. I am waiting a little bit to make sure the bottom is in, but I think we hit bottom at 3150 and now the rise back to 3650 is encouraging. lol

I have not assumed that. I think the 7nm ASICS will drop in price to $500 (they are already in $800-$1000 range) and this will keep up or surpass difficulty. I also think Bitcoin scarcity after the next halvening will drive up the price of Bitcoin above my $5600 2 year average projection. With a 100%+ annual ROI, it will be very easy to justify upgrading the equipment every 2 years.

The capital cost of Solar/Wind is still more expensive than Hydro at $0.057. Ex: So one miner pulling 1300 watts will cost about $45/mo in electricity. It can generate between $70 and $150 per mo in BTC depending on price, effeciency, pool, difficulty etc. An 1800 watt (w 220v) solar system (Natures Generator for example) costs $2000. Finance $2000 over three years and you are looking at $60-80/mo which is more than Hydro. After three years the power is free, but three years in crypto is an eternity lol
I have been looking into ADDING Solar to my facility to REDUCE my electric bill a small amount which would lower my electric bill, but its still a 5-10 year ROI. My instinct is to wait for Solar and Battery tech to get cheaper. Its clearly getting better every year.

Namecoin is not trying to be a store of value or a global currency. It is using blockchain and SHA256 for a completely different application. It does not have 80% of Bitcoins Hashrate.

Ask not what your world can do for you, but what you can do for your world! lol ... Running a full node is voluntary and does not pay much. You join a large community of networked worldwide nodes that share the responsibilty of verifying transactions on the now 10yr bitcoin blockchain. There are other ways to acquire bitcoin by mining and buying low and selling on exchanges. This computer sits and runs 24x7 in my mining operation and I use it to monitor my ASIC chip temperatures. So it made sense for me to run a full node on it at the same time.

$450/mo is fixed cost for rent, per miner electricity is about $45/mo. $350/mo is for five S9j’s. But I am adding Solar to lower electricity further. The S15 looks promising in power saving mode.

What Bitmain senior executives did was stupid and they got fired for it. However investors and board members quickly reacted and is in process of restructuring and they have to cut somewhere. The people who were running the Texas initiative had good intentions. Its not their fault. Bitmain is not printing money. They are a leading player in a very new market space frought with risk.

You are not correct. Why is it so hard to understand the concept of risk/reward? I am not giving money away. Its an investment. Its a risk. No risk, no reward. Its a simple business concept. I DO NOT recommend you invest your life savings!!! I am not doing that.

Correct and Yes I followed the hard fork lunacy and Bitmain is paying the price for it. But it failed in my opinion. The real problem is we still dont have any non-China based ASIC Miner Manufacturers who are producing quality product. Where is Motorola? Intel? IBM, HP or Texas Instruments? China dominates all global Semiconductor manufacturing - not just the crypto Miners. So if you want to stay ahead of difficulty curve we have to buy from China. Pretty common in many global industries actually. Same with IPhones and Servers etc. You have to “sleep with the enemy with one eye open” lol

Just started building a few months ago. Pretty common for a new business to lose money at first. I figure its a good time to invest while price is at bottom. I missed the last halvening. I believe in Bitcoin long term and I believe it will spike again as we approach the next halvening in May 2020. My window is 2 yrs but I am also doing it for my kids, age 22 and 16. I can afford to lose the investment, but I dont think it will go to zero. Too many big players entering - NASDAQ, NYSE/Bakkt, Fidelity, Starbucks, Microsoft. I also own stocks, bonds real estate, gold and silver. I also buy BTC and hold. Crypto is less than 5% of my total portfolio and I also still pull a very large annual salary as VP of R&amp;D for a successful company. This is very high risk, with a potential for very high returns. Its like venture capital investing one in ten chance to hit a home run. If you dont swing the bat, you wont hit the ball.
My two year strategy is here. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:08:04
The difficulty factor adjusts approx every 2 weeks to the up and down of hash rate. This creates a dampening effect and smooths the system out over time. These two forces reacting to one another is similar to a patent I have on a self regulating fluid flow device that dampens the delivery of drugs being administered to a patient in the medical device industry.

I have nine S9s. I buy direct from Bitmain price has been falling. $500 to $350 without PS then with PS. So  for five about $2000. I also upgraded the power supplies to be UL rated because local electrical inspector wanted UL logo on the PSUs. I had to also add multiple 220 outlets which cost $1000. Plus the 220v PDUs and computer for remote monitoring and security cameras etc.  Travel and I have a local IT guy who is doing periodic work. I have 400 amps in the building which means I can get about 40-50 S9s (6.25amps each) before having to ask for more from local PUD. So hoping to scale it to 10x its current size by summer. We also have to work on venting the heat out and I want to add Solar Panel net metering to lower the electrical. Baby Steps. I will probably buy S15s from now on. Hoping the prices will drop some.

Nicehash is like a broker. They connect buyers and sellers. They manage the bidding process from people worldwide who dont want to buy hardware but still want to mine. My miners are set to SHA256. So buyers can bid to use my miners to mine any coin that uses that algo. So no. I do not know what buyers are mining with my hash power. I dont care either. However, my payout is in Bitcoin. So I do care about the price of Bitcoin.

Your faith in Bitcoin is a lot smaller than mine. Which is fine. Everybody has to assess their own personal risk. I budgeted $25k for this investment so your calculations are good with me. I think it has potential to 5x or 10x in sustained profits over 5 years. And this is seperate from how much I am accumulating right now. No I wont share how much.
*** But I will agree my operation is not bottom line profitable yet.*** 
My intention was to show that even at 3600 price of bitcoin a S9j miner can make a gross profit in USA. I am very happy with that because I believe bitcoin is at bottom and will turn bull in 2019. At 6000 I will easily go cash flow positive and I believe in my own skills to cut costs further such as adding Solar and other improvements in ASIC power effeciency. I think its all about tolerance to risk. Mine is much higher than yours because I have the funds to make the gamble and not hurt my family. **** trying really hard not to come across as arrogant! wow!!! ****

I dont think Bitmain will go under. They are re-structuring after some dumb management decisions. “Under New Management” They have a decent product and product support infrastructure. I think its a healthy thing and happens all the time the tech industry. Just because they are in China does not mean they are the enemy. Customers like me will choose vendors based on performance, quality, reliabilty and support.

The increased strength is why institutions like Fidelity are willing to speculate and use Bitcoin as new hedge asset for their large clients. Its also why Apple, Facebook and Twitter are taking it seriously. Its also why I have invested in a small mining and hosting farm.

Trezor hardware wallet and Coinbase Pro to move BTC USD to and from Fiat Bank. Keep track of your gains because IRS treats crypto gains like real estate property, if you make money you report it and pay capital gains tax on it. Don’t be stupid and try to avoid paying your taxes.

Every miner has two 6500 CFM fans blowing hot air out of each unit. We match inflow with outflow. Does not need to be cooled down, that is not what is required. The hot air exhaust is “seperated/sealed” from the miner into the box and then exhaust fans out the building. This keeps the room from getting hotter and hotter. No AC is required.

Electrical Contractor with State License Approved. Data Center Server grade PDUs, all wiring is running to UL certification code. These are data servers, no moving parts. They have variable speed fans that automatically keeps the chips cool and they have a auto shut-down if they get too hot. There will not be a spark.

I have clients who try to run non-Bitmain miners and they are terrible. They are not reliable, they dont connect to the leading pools, they run hot, they break down, firmware is not in English. Bitmain is smart they stress test their miners in their own large farms. I would love to see a German, or USA based semiconductor manufacturer like Intel, Motorola, Seimens, get into the space. But Bitmain has first mover advantage. To protect my investment, I need strong reliable vendors. So far I purchased over 25 units from Bitmain direct  (not a lot in grand scheme lol) and not one issue since I started last August 2018. S9J, T15 and S17. All have performed flawlesly.

For federal tax purposes, the IRS has announced that virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. This includes determining the fair market value of virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or receipt, as well as any gain or loss incurred. For more information, go to

I run a small mining operation. Not a garage operation and not a huge 1,000 unit operation either. My rent is $450/mo and my electricity is $0.05 / kWh. At 3k I am breaking even. So I would prefer the bottom to be at 3k. lol

I have 15 patents as an inventor in software, medical and printing and the IP is owned by the companies that I have worked for over the past 30 years. Corps like Intel accumulate IP to improve company valuation and create licensing revenue opportunities. It costs $20k to $100k in legal to submit and defend a patent. This is a good sign for Bitcoin in general.

We unite as miners because we share a common goal and challenge. We take the risk that others do not. We are the Marines of crypto. We go first into battle. We unite as brothers and human beings worldwide. The Network is designed to be decentralized. All this talk about large miners gaining control is non-sense. Even Bitmain and China miners are not gaining control. As long as there are entrepreneurs worldwide: Canada, Russia, Iceland, USA, etc that can be rewarded for their efforts, it will never be dominated by a single entity.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:48:26
I did read this. Its a free market and free world (some of it anyways) I just dont buy in to this notion of “all or nothing” bitcoin will take over the world!!! No more governments, no more banks! I think its naive.

Debt financing can be good or bad depending on the use of funds. It does not matter if the loan is backed by Bitcoin, Equity in Real Estate, Gold, Inventory or some other asset. It can even be unsecured if you can convince the lender your idea will be successful and you have a high probability of paying back with interest. Its an agreement between the lender and the borrower. If you dont have any experience with debt financing, then you will not understand why this would be useful. But in business world it can be very useful.
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:38:33
This is a meaningless exercise. You can’t compare BTC to LN. That make no sense at all.

Respectfully disagree. You do not know me. Sounds like you have been treated badly in the workplace. Sorry about that. Dont lump us all in the same catgeory. My employees have always been treated with respect and have done well.
And I do not support Coinbase. To me they are a vendor. If they fail, I will switch. I personally have not had any issues trading or moving my crypto with Coinbase between Trezor and my fiat bank. However, I am not naive enough to think things will not go wrong in an emerging new technology space.

Why? You guys think its more secure? Teamviewer app on my Iphone works great. I travel alot and I have other teams and data centers to monitor for other businesses. I am not afraid of Linux or VPNs - I used to code in C alot. My other IT teams have me use Cisco VPN but I need my laptop for this and I am not going to invest in a Cisco router at the mining facility lol. Teamviewer Iphone app works and I love it? The mining facility PC really has no sensitive info in it from my perspective - accept now the live Bitcoin Full Node? Are we worried about hacking of the node thru the open port?

This is just a $300 Windows PC with 4GB Ram and 1TB Hard Drive. All I use this PC for is to check the chip temps of my ASIC miners. It has slow internet. So it took 3 weeks to download and sync up. I thinks its almost done syncing.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:41:44
Yes this computer is in Eastern Washington state for cheap electricity for my ASIC miners. I live in Hawaii so Teamviewer lets me monitor the chip temperatures of the miners remotely. I dont store bitcoin on this computer. I use hard wallet. When I want to trade, I use Coinbase Pro. So far no issues for me.

No. 
I believe by volunteering to add your computer to the bitcoin node list, you are helping to validate transactions on the blockchain. I am pretty new to owning a full node, perhaps others can better explain the node function. 
My Asic Miners run constantly, and I choose to sell my hash power to others via nicehash.com marketplace located in Slovenia. I get rewarded in bitcoin every day, so far its working pretty good. I plan to scale up some more in January.

First, I am not and OP or schill. Could care less about these silly acronyms. Second, I have done my research and have an MBA and BSME and 30yrs experience in software development and awarded 15 patents and have raised over $30m in venture capital. If you think central banks around the world are going to let crypto take over you are dead wrong. There will be a period of co-existance probably for over a century. People will choose to use a global currency like bitcoin and ALSO a fiat currency. There will be situations where it makes sense to use one over the other. For example: I am a believer in the original version of bitcoin and mining for consensus and scarcity. Setting up data centers is in my wheelhouse. So I was able to pay Bitmain in bitcoin for their asic miners for my new mining operation. I did not have to use a fiat currency and the transaction settled in 10 minutes. This is very cool. 
I suggest you get a grip on reality. Coinbase is an exchange for trading. NYSE is an exchange for trading. NASDAQ is an exchange for trading. It would not suprise me if Coinbase gets acquired. As far as protecting your crypto, keep it in a hard wallet and transfer it to an exchange when you want to trade or move it to a fiat bank. 
Peace out and take a chill pill.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:56:06
I have 15 patents and over 20 song copyrights to my name. Patents are very different from Copyrights. Also an application for a copyright to something does not mean the US Copyright office has granted legal protection or validated the application. In Copyright law, the “unique” work has to be challenged in federal court. For example: lets say some lunatic tries to claim rights to the word “Nike”. Nike would object if the claim was filed by a large competitor or by somebody who would threaten the brand. The application will be reviewed and obviously will not be granted because of prior work or other parties have already claimed ownership of the word “Nike”. Also from what I understand the white paper originated under the MIT license so eventually the US Copyright review team will dig into the application and deny the application based on prior precedent. Its all just a stunt to boost the price of BSV. Dont fall for it. Its rediculous.

Yes you can. But its not a “get rich quick scheme”. And it really shouldnt be and never will be because of the halvening and tge difficulty.

Sorry, was not aware of that. But still, Coinbase has raised the most capital in the USA so far and they cannot be ignored. The market will sort itself out. All I can do is be a participant.
