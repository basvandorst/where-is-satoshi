Your parents/family are/should be extremely proud of the person they raised. Creating a life, raising them, eventually going out into the world and having a positive effect is a pretty special feeling. Very inspiring, thank you!

Nothing can sink Bitcoin. What you mean is sink the skyrocketing value and cause get rich quick people to lose a bunch of money. What's the problem?
Bitcoin works quite well at $2 as it does at $2000. People will always mine, people will always use Bitcoin, it doesn't need anything beyond that.

Lots of people believe Mt Gox was holding BTC back. They had way too much of the market and they were completely incompetent. People have been saying to stay away from them for years. So lots of people are glad they are dead. 
In the long term this is good news. And lots of people are buying for the long term. I don't see why the price should tank, Mt Gox isn’t BTC and them being incompetent is old news. That's already been priced into BTC.

Mt Gox was always a cancer. While it's good they are gone, this is not the way I would have liked it to happen. The whole "we're closed, it was all stolen, goodbye" is going to really hurt in the short term.

He also says 'Well, technically speaking it's not "lost" just yet, just temporarily unavailable'.

Those BTC were always in the hands of criminals. Now it's just in the hands of different criminals.

Hopefully someone bought them out and will pay out BTC/fiat owed. That's looking like wishful thinking at this point.

Mt Gox being incompetent is old news. If they're dead, that's good news. If this is just them being incompetent and it costs them market share, that's good news. 
Any way you spin it, this is good news for BTC regardless of what Mt Gox does.

He could easily have the 700k coins in his own wallet. When the "hacks" happened months/years ago, it's going to be hard to prove it wasn't just him ripping the company off then declaring bankruptcy. If done right, it’s completely untraceable.

Mt Gox was not worth $400 million. Of the BTC/USD they had, it was 95% of the customers deposits. They might have been worth $10-$20 million at most.

It's impossible they lost 750k coins over 2 years. An exchange needs to know 4 numbers. 1) How much fiat do users have 2) how much BTC do users have 3) how much fiat do we have 4) how much BTC do we have.
Without that, you can't run the business. You don't know if you're making money, losing money, you can't hire people,  move into a building, can't pay taxes, can't do a balance sheet, can't do anything.
There's no way they were 100k BTC in the hole, 200k BTC in the hole, 500k BTC in the hole, and didn't notice until everything was gone. That's just impossible. From day 1, there was an admin dashboard that had those 4 numbers. For two years, no one at Mt Gox checked to see how many BTC they had in their possession? Come on. 
They are faking the theft and stole it themselves or the document is BS. The whole idea that they never checked the balance of BTC in their cold storage for 2 years is utterly impossible. Maybe they noticed when 10% was gone, maybe even 20%. But when 99% was gone? Come on.

It's flawed logic. Amazon.com doesn't make any "profit". That's because they don't want to be making any money.
Amazon reinvests it (billions) and counts it as expenses. As shady as Mt Gox has been, I wouldn't trust anything about how much they made. They could have easily skimmed millions off the books by pocketing the BTC and claiming they're barely making anything (and thus pay very little in taxes in Japan). The nature of Bitcoins makes this rather easy. They easily could have been "insider trading" the exchange and since it's not regulated that's not even illegal. 
This seems like a nice setup for Mark to say "See? I never made anything! I lost it all just like you guys!". Sure.

You don't lose 750k coins over 2 years without noticing. No one ever checked how many coins were in the hot and cold storage?
You didn't notice when you lost 100k coins? 400k coins? You noticed when you lost 99% of it? Come on. 
People really think that MtGox one day looked at the cold storage and said "holy shit! we just lost $300 mil! it's all gone! woops". 
There's a lot of BS floating around. There's no reason to start guessing no one really knows at this point.

We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
Establish justice, general welfare, blessings of liberty, seem to conflict with the federal govt spying on our every move without reason. And if you want to know what the founding fathers thought of privacy, it was of such importance that it has its own document, the bill of rights.
The actions were so egregious there is little argument the govt was massively in the wrong. To say that his oath didn't cover something like this, is fucking retarded. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:13:29
Seriously? His oath is to the constitution, which was being violated. Horribly. A govt agency is tracking every txt, recording every call, saving every email, attachment, website, message you send, without reason or cause, and someone in that agency says this is extremely illegal and against everything this country stands for, and he's breaking his oath? 
Actually he's following his oath, to serve the AMERICAN PEOPLE, who were being raped UP THE ASS. If he didn't have justification to "whistleblow", then no one ever has in the history of this county.

The problem is there are no fundamentals in Bitcoin. People use market movements as fundamentals. Price going down, suddenly MEANS something. Instead of it just being someone selling a bunch of coins.
