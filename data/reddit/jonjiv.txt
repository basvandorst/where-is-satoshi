If for some reason bitcoin moved 10x whatever direction the S&amp;P 500 moved, this would be a crappy, but effective way of showing a correlation. 
But there is no correlation here, except the fact that both went up during the period of time.

The [Leapfrog Scout and Violet stuffed animals]( are customized for your kid through an audio jack. Pretty interesting since the customization website is actually sending audio files to the toy, but sends it through a digital sound (likely mp3 file) instead of an analog sound.
You notice a lot of old school computing techniques when you have a kid. Many baby toys use binary switches to identify items such as letters and numbers. My kid has a toy dinosaur that can identify the food on the plastic discs you feed it, using a 4 bit switch in its mouth.

The stream was in HD. You literally didn't even watch it and you're complaining about how it proves nothing. 
An entire team of some of the most brilliant VFX artists with months of time could even get 10 seconds of young Carrie Fisher across the uncanny valley and you think the government can do better with hours of footage because they're the government?
I understand your skepticism, but if you watch this Assange video and still believe it's faked, you're bordering on delusional here. I've been a professional video editor for 10 years now and I can tell you with 99.99% certainty that this video is real and it was shot today. Faking this video would have been an enormously expensive and incredible feat of modern technology. Whoever designed this tech should sell it now to movie studios, because he'd be filthy rich. VFX artists currently waste months doing what you think can be done in minutes. 
What can Assange do to prove to you he's alive? Seriously. What exactly are you looking for here?

This is literally the form to apply to become a Forbes contributor: 
Seriously, a Google Doc. Yes, they won't take just anybody, but the bar is pretty low. Have some crappy book on Amazon that nobody reads, but maybe makes you look like an expert? You can be a contributor!
It's not a real job in the same way getting on staff at the New York Times would be. You don't have an editor giving you assignments. You don't need any real journalist credentials. You don't get a salary. You're a blogger who gets paid in ad revenue. No one reads your articles? No money. 
So the point is, if the Wall Street Journal posted a headline like this, it would have some weight to it, but being a "Forbes contributor" is just a way for random people to publish their blog posts on Forbes' domain. It's maybe one step above being a Seeking Alpha contributor.

Hedges aren't free, so obviously I'm paying a premium to keep one. Like insurance, that's just a fact of life.

I'm guessing the vast majority of people purchased their bitcoin rather than got paid in it. Also, you should pay the income taxes the same tax year you got paid, and the taxes would be based on the USD value of the bitcoin the day you got paid. So bitcoin appreciation and sale date should be irrelevant.

The government can’t stop bitcoin but it can certainly make it almost useless for its citizens. 
Let’s say tomorrow it became illegal to wire USD between an American bank account and a bitcoin exchange.
Making it difficult to obtain and liquidate would make it an extremely undesirable asset. This would have a very negative effect on its value for American citizens. 
So as long as bitcoin is not a mainstream means of payment, it is very vulnerable to these types of rules.

Because more people want Bitcoin than the other currencies.

I guess I need to look into this. By default the Ledger Nano S generates a 24 word passphrase and asks for a 4-8 digit pin to lock the device. However, if someone gets the 24 words, they can recover the wallets without the pin.

Buying red only works if it eventually recovers. There is a reason people call it "catching a falling knife."

Currently the Bid is $9008 USD and the ask is $9999 USD, so huge spread.

I'm guessing it only works with Zimbabwean banks. So yes, you can move and sell your BTC in very tiny increments, but huge mark-up, but then you have a ton of USD that you can't move off the exchange... unless you bought BTC at a huge markup and moved the BTC.

If you want to get specific, national defense is around 15% of federal tax spending. It is slightly over half of discretionary spending, however. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are the majority of overall spending, but they are not "discretionary" since they are separate taxes.
So, really, the majority of our federal taxes go to social programs. Not roads. Not wars. Taxes lean more heavily on infrastructure at the state and local levels, however, where very little of your money is going towards building tanks (none in the case of local taxes).

Seems like Bitcoin in Zimbabwe is being used as a USD alternative, not a USD replacement. USD cash is king, but it is very hard to obtain, so people are looking for more accessible currencies.

@_date: 2017-10-24 01:23:28
It’s confusing because both statements are true. 
Your hardware wallet stores your private keys (which you need to move your BTC). So in a way your BTC is on the hardware. But you can have the same private keys on multiple hardware wallets, which means your BTC is not exclusively on one device, depending on your setup - which makes it seem more like a “key” to move your BTC. 
You can even have a recovery phrase or the actual private keys written out, putting your bitcoins on a piece of paper or whatever else you can write or inscribe on. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:21:40

Yet, in this first world country we still have people who barely make a living wage and people who are homeless. I’m pretty sure $200 is a significant amount of money to both of those groups. 
Again. It’s about perspective. If you can’t afford food until your next paycheck clears, maybe speculating with $200 isn’t a great idea.

You're describing a Roth IRA, which is a type of IRA. A normal IRA is very similar to a 401k. Like a 401k, it is pre-tax, but it is self-directed and not dependent on your employer.

Because if more people want or need a limited resource, the price has to go up. It's pretty simple economics.
If there were only 10 billion dollars in the word, you would get a heck of a lot more for a dollar. Its material value would be significantly higher.

In that case the price would be $0, because something you can't sell is worth nothing. But with something like Bitcoin, there's always a new buyer at every lower price, so the situation is pretty much impossible.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:45:30
Not quite the same as being able to purchase bitcoin directly in an existing investment account. I would have bought way more bitcoin than I have had I not had to cash out traditional investments, do an ACH transfer to my checking, and another to an exchange every time I wanted to buy some. 
This is basically the same thing Mint already has, the ability to view Coinbase balances along with your other investments.

Don't carry more than you're willing to lose. Wallets are often stolen, lost, or left at a "friend's" place. 
Also... holy crap, how thick is your wallet?

This is basically a pump and dump. The catch is you need to con other people into buying. It's hard to move the price and get out with a profit if you're the only one buying (or you're doing the majority of it).

This is confusing because you don't make a profit from mining unless you sell the coins you mine. If you're buying and selling at the same time, you're canceling out your actions. You have to be buying more coins than you're selling to put upward pressure on the price. Once you start selling more than you're buying, you're putting downward pressure on the price. 
It's very easy to lose money in this hypothetical scenario because the price will fall just as fast or faster than you artificially rose it. 
This is all only possible if you're moving tens of millions of dollars a day in BTC. In quantities less that that, you're not affecting much. BTC volume has been around $60M per day recently.

It depends on your tax bracket and how long you hold the position. If the position is held at least a year, then it is a long term capital gain. The tax rate for long term capital gains is either 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your tax bracket.

Tesla has been around since 2003 and many still consider it a startup. Coinbase certainly isn't an extreme example of this label.

And it also happens when you buy. Selling huge lots and buying huge lots have almost identical results, just in opposite directions. That's why this type of manipulation shouldn't be profitable.

Oof. Backup seed in a bag is no different than carrying around the same value in cash. Hopefully OP at least used a passphrase that isn’t written down.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:47:30
But you're ignoring what happens the other direction. There is panic buying and short covering. Automatic buys happen going up just like automatic sells happen going down.

If Bitcoin was worth $50k each, holders of Bitcoin would have about 30% more money total than holders of Apple stock. Has Apple stock flooded the economy with too many wealthy people?
Now at a million per coin, you're talking $21 Trillion in stored value. That's probably a bit absurd in today's terms unless the entire world dumped fiat for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-13 04:06:54
I see this theory often, especially concerning stock manipulation, but I don't see how it can ever be profitable. You crash the price dumping, which means your last lots are going to sell near the bottom. You then have to buy it all back, but your bidding should then shoot the price back up again. 
It should all be a complete wash.
