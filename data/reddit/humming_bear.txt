Better late than never? 
Luckily, the ongoing viability of Bitcoin as a currency only depends on the first decade, right? Surely nobody else needs to adopt it...

I’m certainly not claiming any sort of specialized knowledge. Again, all i know is that I was living in London when I read about it. So it could have been as late as summer 2009. Shrug.

Damn dude. Didn’t realize that bitcoin was for the hipster elite. But don’t worry, once me and the rest of the clueless newbs show up with our puny purchases, you’ll have moved on to some other cryptocurrency that the rest of us aren’t cool enough to know about.

It truly is depressing. That is kind of the point of the post - I sat on my ass for far too long making excuses as to why I could or should wait - it's a post about regret. $30 dollars is a pittance, but mostly a symbolic gesture to make me feel committed to learning, growing, and investing further and more intelligently. The point of the post is merely to try to get involved and to learn about bitcoin from people like you who know more about it than i do.

Only the best for you

Thank you, I'll look into this.

All i know is where I lived when I read about it. I lived in that place between 2008 and 2009, I apologize for not knowing the date that I read about something that was unknown and unimportant at the time. How foolish of me.

Another reason I put off purchasing was not knowing about trusted sources. Sadly, it seems to me that something like Cash App is associated with corporate interests and so if i want to hold bitcoin independently, to do so through something like cash app is not the best way forward. Would you say that is accurate? I know about wallets, but don't know quite how one acquires such a thing or how it is done. I'm off to study up!
(Thank you for a reasonable response)
