You contact the seller through our web or request their phone number. And you meet in person. Just like Craigslist. Maybe they will show the items receipt or you can have someone know the items and inspect it with you when you meet.
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:46:27
I don’t think black and white works man. Too serious.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:36:13

I am not bragging about Bitnearby.com. But I think the solution for buying things with bitcoin has arrived. Because this website uses p2p system and the trade is done locally. So no more bitpay stuff. Just your address transfer to another address.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:46:02
Cool. That’s why I changed it to free, no more monthly free
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:04:37
Follow our Twitter to stay updated! :)

This is so called professional designer who did it.
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:52:14
Absolutely, however for people who doesn’t want 3rd party payment system such as bitpay, they will like it. :)
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:34:31
But are you happy?
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:58:40
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:41:34
Right. Just imagine later there will be no currency. When you buy an apple, cost you 0.00001 btc. Cryptocurrency will be the new global currency. You don’t need to convert. Just 1 apple 0.00001 btc for example. That’s it. No matter where you go in the world. Each supermarket has its own price.

Bitnearby.com provides option to buy or sell your gift card to people with bitcoin. As well as other things. All done locally. Everything free. Kinda like Craigslist but for bitcoin users.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:38:05

You clearly don’t have a sense of humor.
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:33:04
Why not. Give your friend a gift or something
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:03:44
Thank you ��
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:32:38
But I don’t have btc related merch. The website is like a classification for bitcoin. I just added the service feature.
