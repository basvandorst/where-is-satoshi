That was just segwit usage, not adoption.  Most are assuming it was someone big and exchange, or even coinbase trying to clear dust out of their wallets. Nothing has changed segwit is NOT getting adopted anymore today than it was last week.

Flextrans fixed all malleabilty issues as well as kept the blocks intact and added doublespend proofs. Flextrans was always seen as a better option but it was taken to bitcoin classic after it was denied because Segwit was already chosen.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:09:42
You realize this has nothing to do with Segwit, right?  This has to do with the fact that thousands are leaving the market fees are always low when prices are low, because less and less people are USING Bitcoin a bunch of people hodling keeps it from falling too far, but you are not going to stop the noobs from leaving.  Now a lot of that has to do with how far behind we are on actually providing a working Bitcoin so people have bled to the alts and are not Bitcoin Hodlers anymore, but if LN can be widespread in the next couple months we should get those people back.

13 isn't going to do it. How do we open our own nodes? Special hw? How much to open and close, does it use the current bitcoin fee both ways? How much are the fees going to be if we do not get more nodes? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:52:04
Wrong again, Flextrans was introduced beta testing on bitcoin classic on March 2017 and segwit was not installed on litecoin until May 2017. Flextrans again did more and kept Bitcoin Blockchain unchanged. Segwit was the main goal of Adam Back from Blockstream. You had your chance to do this right, one hard fork to 2mb, Flextrans and lightning in 2020. That would have brought the community together and the price would be well over 20k. Instead we will have the best invention ever created in Bitcoin destroyed by one company, so sad.

Localbitcoins was working on Segwit adoption long before the conference. Segwit adoption is not exactly easy. It takes quite a bit of manipulation to include it if you want to include all the features. I'm not saying one or two BOSSES came away wanting to add it, but it would not have happened that fast.

@_date: 2018-01-23 00:37:01
?? Where did you get that.  I just think we are counting our chickens before they hatch, this new adoption that this thread seems to imply did not happen it was just one big whale using Segwit to Game the system and get the lowest fees they could when consolidating funds. That does not mean they changed their HW/SW for their users or instituted Segwit into whatever platform they own.  They just clean up wallets with small amounts and you can see that from the bump on the charts.
Edit addendum: I would love to be wrong on this - I've recently purchased more BTC, but it looks like more and more people are escaping BTC than trying to make it work.

I explained why it seems like a big company used segwit to consolidate funds(dust in wallets) then right back to not using it again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:19:22
We know Segwit lowers fees, but just raising the block size to the 2mb that was agreed to in the NYA would have fixed the issue and we would mot have Bcash to worry about. On top of that we would probably +$20k. This entire thing could have been avoided by the core devs if Blockstream did NOT have a stranglehold on all of Bitcoin.
Core could fix all the problems, right now, they know how, and they are refusing to look into it. With competitors looking a lot better this fix may be too little too late though? However, if core made the effort I bet people would return back in droves and companies would be thrilled to implement segwit.

@_date: 2018-05-10 18:06:22
How is this beautiful? This just shows how centralized the LN model is only the rich will have nodes that are used, because they are the ones that can afford to STAKE their BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:55:23
That is what centralization is. If the nodes can only be maintained by the rich then the rich get the fees. Nodes are worse than mining gear at least a regular person can get together 2k and buy mining rigs, but not tie up btc stake in nodes.
Fees will go to all the rich people.

Here is another video of Bitcoin and BCH Chatting about being king: [King of Bitcoin](
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:03:53
There is a competitive advantage to be a paid lightning network node, you can only do that if you can STAKE the amount of BTC that will pass through your node. This is going to have to be a large amount and constantly rebalanced to maintain. Watchtowers will also have a very high barrier to entry too since the cost to run watchtower nodes and enforce challenges will likely be a very spendy process. Neither of these will be competitive for the average person, when a single miner is $1500 none of these other LN things seem possible without major expenses and maintenance to make it profitable. If it is not profitable people will not continue running them.

Oh and upvoted this post, about this idiot author not the article.
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:51:34
To explain - simply put if I'm part of a big pool I'm almost guaranteed that blocks will be found and I will be paid.  As a member of a smaller pool too.  I know I may go days without my pool finding a block - when they do find a block it seems to pay out more per GHS of power than cex.io. Notice I used the word SEEMS, because this is not true - it will always pretty much pay out an equal amount per GHS of power.  So it does not matter what pool you are on - I know this.  However, because  CEX is really the only cloud mining website out there, that is affordable, until they get competition or the prices of mining rigs come down then this is really my only choice for being able to mine Bitcoins.  A few of you have said I do not understand the concept.  This is false.  In fact I watched carefully as BTCguild did the, proof of concept, doublespend.  What I did realize at that time is people believe in Bitcoin too much for double spending to ever be something to worry about. Wanting CEX to be the "BEST" just means I want to be on the winning team - I'm competitive and a number of 42% was just awesome to see. Remember folks BTCguild used to be in the lead.
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:02:11
This is r/bitcoin, they used this forum to turn the masses against the wishes of the majority in the New York and Hong Kong agreements(consensus) to keep it at 1 mb. I doubt you will get much support.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:29:59
No they did not have 4mb blocks - Segwit at full 100% capacity and full use may increase the block size to 4MB. However we had a adoption deadline to hit and we missed it. 
Segwit has increased the block weight at its current adoption to less than expected and now they might be able to get up to 3mb with full adoption, but that is not going to happen, because it has been too much of a challenge for some developers and Segwit is opt in service.
Segwit also requires the Miners to mine the main block and the signature block - they only get rewarded for one.
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:33:38
All the overspending fear mongering did was increase the amount of people on cex.io the 42% it hit was luck and today's downswing was once again luck, or bad luck. They are currently running at about 4.78(higher than yesterday) phs. No matter what happens the growth of slush,elgius, btcguild and ghash.io should be fine, because ghash and btcguild have made a promise to the Bitcoin community that even if they were to gain 51% of the network they would never take advantage of that loophole. They are running businesses and long term is way more profitable than ripping off an idea.

Doesn't matter, who it was it was the Bitcoin consensus, that was BEST for the future of Bitcoin. 2mb block increase would have been nothing.

The easiest way to understand it is Bitcoin,when running perfectly, will compensate to the value of products or services. The Bitcoin will hopefully never compensate to a fiat currency. If the latter happens then Bitcoin might as well be the USD and will be as horribly inflationary as the USD.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:06:07
I believe it is down voted, because government has no business sticking their greedy fingers into this. There is no profit to Bitcoin it always will be based on the value the holders of Bitcoin assign to it, and the physical work used to mine it, so constitutionally speaking it can't be taxed. Labor should not be taxed either but it is, because the government forces your employers to steal it from you.
They don't need to care about volatility, because that is the risks holders are taking...they choose it therefore it is not A fiat currency (value based by government force and manipulation). Businesses will start based on Bitcoin from consulting to bitcoin educators, again not the government's business.
Now I can tell you how to answer one question that most will not ask...is it detrimental to the USD? Only if the united states continues robbing it's citizens to kill people to pay for illegal wars, and keeps removing the citizens freedoms, and if it continuesto unconstitutionaly tax us on our labor - work without pay is slavery.

That doesn't help when Bitcoin was your way out of suicide. What looked like a sound investment has been ruined by a few and they should be held responsible for the pain they bring.  If people do commit suicide over MTGOX then manslaughter should be tacked on not just theft. A lot of people being garnished by creditors and people just trying to HIDE their money from "the man" used Bitcoin as a savings account.  These people are the ones being hurt the most in this "transition," I happen to be one of those, but lucky enough to not have my funds in MTGOX.  The problem...I've lost $500 in value and now need to make a withdraw...grrr.

I agree as a member of cex.io I hold a big stake and always want them to be the best. To tell you the truth tho, I would much rather own a bigger stake in smaller pools so each block pays more instead of hoping for luck and grabbing the quantity of the blocks.

Now thanks to the big Bashing of GHASH.io looks like elgius is coming in from behind - have they released any info on their stance on double spending? I hope they believe in Bitcoin as much as Ghash.io and BTCguild do. They might be the unscrupulous pool that could really screw over Bitcoin.
Also, isn't the reason we all stand behind Bitcoin is because we truly want to see a FREE market come back into play? Don't you think bashing GHASH is defeating this purpose? Please remember this company cares just as much about the double spend issue(51%) as any others please read their press release and decide if they are evil?

I think one of the best way to get the word out is simply leaving a printed flyers on tables in coffee shops with something simple written on it...like: it's easier,then you think, to get started with Bitcoin scan the bar code below to learn how. The printed 2d barcode takes the prospective Bitcoiner to a landing page with a step by step guide. My guide includes coinbase, faucets(to get them started with free btc), and often cex.io or links to mining hardware. Since I use referral links I'm amazed how well this works. I do not overdo it either I leave one at the table I'm sitting at or tuck it in a menu at a restaurant, bulletin boards, or just handing it to friends so your landing page does the proselytizing and you don't have to say a word.

Most of this is due to the banks you use if you are using Chase, hsbc,wells fargo, bofa or any of the other big banks switch to a local credit union.

Ghash.io has already discussed a way for their hardware to be pointed at other pools, in the near future. This will allow cex.io the ability to continue growth, but keep from owning more than 50% of the market. The beauty of this is thousands of people own a portion of the hardware and will be able to point their ghs percent to pools of their choice.  Btcguild is the other big player in the market as long as neither of these pools take 51% of the market everything is fine.

That's what I just said, everything equals out, does it matter that I like to have an insignificant number tell me I'm the winner, not really, but it does speak volumes for the cloudmining business model...the only reason I'm personally with ghash.io so that I can hold more than 50ghs of hashing power for less than a 1000 USD investment. If I could afford hardware or if another company started cloud mining at a better or equal price I would be all over that. Bfl is our current hope for that, but hearing that their hardware has an average lifespan of 6 months is depressing.

Okpay.com allows you to charge a prepaid debit card. There are some strange fees, so read all the details, but I used this and worked for some small transactions. You can also get a small amount of giftcards using gyft. Other than that I agree by a cheap android device.

So for your point on Coffee - simply put: Starbucks sell about 4 million coffee drinks daily at approximately $5.00 per drink. So if Bitcoin does not start working on a more "Micro" level then you are leaving about $20 million a day on the table for another cryptocurrency to grab up. Lately Bitcoin has not been working to well with other cryptos so I'm not sure that a ton of that daily 20 million dollars will go into bitcoin or be distributed among alts?  I might be wrong maybe if we can turn that 20 million into BTC great otherwise your doing a disservice to every holder of btc. EDIT: ( BTW this is 7,300,000,000 a year in coffee)
Edit/addition: on you point about Square - it is integrated into square cash app at this point it looks like you can only buy, sell and hold. I'm not even sure that you can spend it directly(don't quote me on this). Just having it integrated to increase awareness is awesome tho.

TLDR version: If you saw segwit2x as a threat to bitcoin in any way then ask yourself is Bitcoin living up to it's potential or is it being stifled by inaction and fear?
If  was in the state it should be, and working, then it would not have anything to fear. It is one thing to love Bitcoin because of it's tech and it's potential but that is currently being stifled by fear and inaction. The core dev team has not only had plenty of time to fix these issues they have had time to make  readily accepted in the general market.  The core dev team and board members used to be very active in all communities and would never in a million years attack alt coins. They didn't have to they were always TOO good for that(meaning the tech kicked butt) For everyone on here to be attacking coins in any way shape or form actually pushes people away from bitcoin. The toxicity reads a group chat in World Of Warcraft instead of a nice welcoming place to welcome people to bitcoin.
How can it be different - first the censorship has to stop. Next: anytime comes in and says hey BitcoinCash is better than bitcoin. Then respond with: Yeah, we have heard a lot of people have found some good things with Bitcoin Cash - why do you think it is better. They respond: It's good because joe shmoe on twitter told me it has big blocks. You respond, well big blocks do have their advantages in fact it makes Bitcoin cash better at every day cheap transactions are you looking to make money on an investment or a unit of everyday exchnage because bitcoin can store your value and add to the amount you are worth just by holding it. Plus right now buying bitcoin is much easier because it is more readily available.  See what I did there I most likely stole that Bitcoin Cash er right back to the bitcoin side.
On the other hand I come in and say the same thing and get insta banned or get called names then I will never come back to this toxic environment. The most important thing I ever learned from sells is never criticize the competition, unless it is done in a playful way, you are more likely to lose a customer than they are.

In fact there was only a place to buy bitcoin. Stop pretending that he is trying to trick people into buying stuff they do not want. It is quite clear what you are purchasing inside the app. And because you use the same Bitcoin address for both bitcoin cash and bitcoin purchases there is very little confusion. Since the BCH wallet is actually in a separate app window it is actually hard to mess things up. You can even change the icons color to differentiate it more.

Of course they are different. Now. On august 1st they were nearly identical with a few major rule changes first seen first placed, 8mb blocks and shortly after eda and now eda fix to make it fair on the btc chain and not give bch an unfair market advantage. They will continue to diverge from each other and each will have their advantages and disadvantages. 
Still full nodes do not enforce they just tell you the rules.
I just got done saying that I have setup both, because I program for both.
 Virtually identical does NOT in anyway say they are identical, but they are still both bitcoin and both are just as secure, robust as the other. As things are added that are not bitcoin or changes how Bitcoin works that can change over time. We already saw that with BCH and the eda and fix.We are also seeing this with segwit and btc too. Neither of these were Bitcoin. They were ADDONS so the anyone can spend stuck segwit coins or the eda created extra btc and will reach 21mil a little earlier than btc.
The Bitcoin protocol has not changed. In May that will be different tho as BCH will reactivate core bitcoin op codes that have been disabled by the btc devs.
Op_group is still in contention due to security risks, but op xor, cat,and, or will be reactivated so yes in MAY it will be WAY different.

Full mining nodes are the only ones that can reject or orphan blocks non mining nodes just don't RECORD invalid nodes. The miners update the blockchain so if their rules don't agree to the non mining rules your info can differ. Non mining nodes can not change the rule directly unless that node is where the miners get their software.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:17:24
You really need to read more and not react with emotion. Legal authorities move in on anyone that steals money. The btc or bch would have LONG SOLVED and destroyed a miner who stole from the network. As that miner is penniless and trying to survive in a cardboard box is when the authorities move in. We might hear about it because we all would HATE that miner and stop long enough to point and laugh.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:04:49
Agreed, that is why the good miners end up solving the issue and cleaning up the network. Only bad miner gets the shaft.

No, A non mining node can not fork the network. It just disconnects and stops recording if rules are bein broken.

Right it requires 100% consensus from all parties or you soft fork something in and hope and pray 3rd party devs actually wanna go through the work to add it. Took me 6 hours of work for segwit and another 5 for bech
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:10:15
Actually I guess my statement about segwit could be construed as wrong since it does make miners do extra work by processing a main block and a sig block? They only get paid for the main block, on segwit, but they can fit in twice the transactions so they are pretty much doing the same amount of work in the long run.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:05:05
You are correct. They can not fork the network because they can not write to the ledger. If they see a bad miner sending out bad blocks or breaking the rules. A node basically says, "beep, boop does not compute, disconnect." Seriously tho, if it does find a flaw it disconnects from the network until miners have worked out the details.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:31:54
Since I said I REMEMBERED this it was big enough news that in the end no proof of any wrongdoing or that it was done purposely or could not be proven if it was. Instead it created websites tracking software that would look from everything from 0conf fast finds to Finney attacks. Once these new tracking methods were put in place good miners incorporated these detections into their tools. I know there was a big discussion on bitcointalk and all the devs/programmers/statisticians/mathematicians etc could not only not prove it, but said both cex and dice?? Had to have worked together because only winning or losing bets could be spent. In the end the only double spends that really happen and are proven are respends/0confs/glitches. Since these are one offs devs have just made them less likely. 
I'm not here to prove what I remember, but I can say that proving it actually happened, with sources, should have been your main goal instead of make someone prove your accusations wrong. Just saying.

I don't mean to be mean, but I can't say this any other way. Nodes can be spun up in the amount of time it takes to sync to the network. The whole point of my original reply was the node metric is dumb. If bch ers ever have a reason to mistrust miners they could spin up 1000s millions of non mining nodes and still not do anything. They do not actually do any of the work. They would however then have a vote in consensus. This is how it works on BTC too, but majority have no clue how to vote. 
Once consensus is reached devs create or change btc or bch to conform to those rules. 
Once those rules are in place the SW will not permit miners to run different rules unless they run a different non dev/consensus version at that time it is up to the GOOD miners to stop them. 
The non mining nodes since they can not change or protect the blockchain. Refuse to record non consensus blocks and usually remove themselves from the network until the good miners work out the details.
Game theory is the most important thing here. The money to be good always outweighs trying to be bad. This could change if one pool got more than 51% hashpower, but there is still a 49% chance they will lose and if they lose they lose hard. That is why non mining nodes don't matter. A nice halong, avalon or even a antminer gives the people the real power. This prevents a mining pool from getting 51% hashrate because THE PEOPLE can point their miners to weaker pools. 
The mining ecosystem works  like a living entity who s entire goal is to stay alive and work

I personally can not note any technically different performance since I compare nearly identical wallet configs in both bch and btc, but I have not benchmarked the two on performance. All I care as a 3rd party dev is they work.
 If anything people seem to like 0conf on BCH because they get their money instantly.

I'm not in any way a shill. I just know what non mining nodes do and don't do. Andreas explains this in a video and does not counter anything I said about nodes. Like I said it is pointless, for the average user, who do not use as intended. If they use a 3rd party block explorer to track transactions and don't use the node all they are doing is wasting electricity. I still use 3rd party block explorer, because it is easier, but I also run a node to test my SW so I can see an exact log. I don't have the node running constantly.
No there are plenty of sources, in fact there are full academic whitepapers etc that are written about how this all works. I'm on my phone, so just not going through the trouble of finding them because every person that has ever mined or at least has a basic grasp of the economics have a very basic understanding of "bad miners" "51% attack vectors" "miner economic risk" "miner economic reward" if you don't you lose as a miner. It is a competitive market and miners are always looking for an advantage, if they could do it the bad way and NOT get caught, and lose everything, trust me they would. The point is they can't. The only way to continue is to play fair. Again, if they could ever gain a competitive advantage and a 51% attack was ever possible they get one chance at it only. If they fail they are screwed, but if they just play "the game" they win anyways so they might as well play. Game theory....blah blah.
Agreed a person not using their nodes in a p2p fashion fail. IMHO 80% of the people that started nodes did so because they were told it helps the network. After that it sat running in the background on their computer. They don't actually use it to process their transaction or even validate their transactions it is too much work and humans are lazy.
Miners aren't blacklisted for valid blocks. The bitcoin SW  allows blacklisting to weed out bad actors. This is done actually quite easily. The reason good actors can't be excluded is it requires a 100% consensus to blacklist a pool or specific miners. That is why governments could force one mining company to blacklist another but the other 18+ miners would still validate the block. Wish I had links to those academic papers. On my desktop at home they are good reads and a little too stoned now to even remember the names.

That is the miners job they validate non mining nodes don't. Miners orphan blocks that do not adhere to rules this is how bitcoin works. Non mining nodes can't do anything to enforce the rules because they do NOT create and write the blocks to the ledger. All that non mining nodes can do is propagate txs to the network. Record transactions until the rules are broken then they disconnect from network and miners then decide to write to ledger or orphan the block. The nodes don't even have to be there to relay to the miners. The current internet infrastructure does that fine.
Edit: you asked how do miners know? They run the same software nodes do. They just do the two extra steps of rejecting or  writing to the blockchain
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:18:50
I never disagreed to this. That is how consensus works.

I have not attempted to sell bch in anyway I'm comparing the two on a dev basis. 
RBF turned off on btc is a bad thing if you have added those features to allow bidding up fees. Which I have. This is actually turned into a bad thing for customer sat.
 I've said before each has features you can choose to use or exploit to give your customers a better experience. 0conf works perfectly because the blocks are never full, there is a risk of doublespend, but you build in a 5 second delay on receipt and that can be avoided.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:36:40
I have never cucked myself to anyone. I think the internal fighting at r/btc is horrible. But if it is legit debate it lives forever if you are just a whiny bitch. That is just there to tell everyone how it is instead of there to teach or *gasp* learn. Why do you think I come here? I believe MORE in BCH's path than BTC, but I hold both. If we had worked together this ecosystem would have been great instead of divided.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:11:40
You really don't get the rbf and 0conf concept do you? If you turn of RBF on btc and the blocks fill up your customer is unhappy because they do not get confirmed or you have to blanket overcharge to guarantee block placement. With RBF you can add features for them to bid up the fee even after placement. If the blocks are not full on btc rbf works very much like 0conf but still doesn't become spendable because miners always added rbf first.
 With bch none of that is needed.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:57:09
Yes. Don't you? Scares me how many people around here don't really understand how bitcoin works. This isn't about BCASH at all it is about how btc works too.

Nodes don't they WARN and RECORD only. Miners are the only ones that can stop them by orphaning the bad blocks. Nodes can reject blocks, but that doesn't propagate to the network.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:08:57
That is how it works on btc too. You are correct about machine consensus, but miners are configurable. To this day, due to game theory, all the miners play fair. It works very much like lightning network once a bad actor has been determined the machine consensus sends out alarms. The mining operator rushes to the warehouse to find out and determine what is going on all other good miners are doing the same. The humans involved may even be calling other pools frantically trying to confirm it is not a bug on their end and after all is determined they implement contingency plans. Every miner has a plan in place, they pray they never have to use it, because it would cause a major hit to the market as the news leaks to the public but again the bad miner is beyond destroyed long before the public even knows.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:11:18
No nodes do no rule enforcement at all. They record a history and can be used to propagate your transactions to the network. They do not write to the ledger. If they note a rule violation they simply disconnect from network or do not record the offending blocks. In the mean time miners can do whatever they want while thousands of miners are screaming bad blocks and the real bitcoin ledger doesn't hear them.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:07:52
You really don't get the concept of a non mining node. The only purpose to run a non mining node is as a merchant pushing your own transactions through that node and keeping records, or to verify your own transactions without trusting a 3rd party. It gives you peace of mind, but does not strengthen the network. I run a node to test wallets, but seriously never use it to even look up my btc transactions. I use a 3rd party block explorer. Logging into my node takes too long and a lot of extra work. 
Don't need a source that is how mining works and always has worked. If a miner starts sending bad blocks they are orphsned by the rest of the miners. A bad miner COULD do a few hours of damage to btc or bch, as other miners might think it is an anomaly but after that the miner would be blacklisted. This is how mining has always meant to be. It has NEVER happened and if it does the reaction time might be slower than anticipated, I think since humans have to get involved due to having to manually black list, and they would probably take hours just to figure out what is going on, but once it is determined it is simple as adding configs to one main computer that controls all the miners to blacklist miners or even entire pools.

Read my response to exab. I will add that miners won't just be punished both on the btc or bch network they would be financially destroyed. All their mining hw would become absolutely worthless too. Within days the news of a bad miner would proliferate the community and that miner attempting to sell their mining hw would be avoided like the plague. Millions of dollars worth of equipment would sit idle as miners and community decide what to do. Legal authorities would move in and seize the equipment because stealing is wrong, and arrests would likely be made. If the bad miners hadn't escaped already.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:46:16
This is kind of a pointless metric. Non mining nodes do nothing for the Bitcoin Cash network. In fact most of the BCHers think running their own node is pointless. Instead the users police the miners and threaten loss of miner income if they start acting bad. The entire bch network will stomp a bad acting miner, so bad, they would not only fail an attack, but would lose thousands if not 100s of thousands in the attempt.

In no way do they enforce rules. They don't have the power. 
They are early warning systems and trackers but that is it. 
Miners can't change rules they run the software that was delivered by devs based in consensus. If they attempt to run non consensus approved software the other 18 miners will orphan their block. If it happens again they get orphaned again until they are blacklisted or the miner fixes the issue that is causing consensus divergence.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:55:09
The user nodes had nothing to do with the UASF this is common misconception. The UASF was introduced by devs using nodes, but still the miners, wallet producers exchanges have to decide to run them. Non mining nodes did nothing and are still doing nothing to help adoption of the opt in services that were included. The UASF did not have any form of bitcoin consensus or vote. People running non mining nodes would have the ability to place a vote when those options are presented to the public, but now that segwit has been implemented allowing for side chains I personally(all feelings)  think that core devs will try and avoid bitcoin specific consensus votes at all costs and try and scale out with layer 2 3 &amp; 4. Consensus is hard to reach and if they want btc to work they are just going to have to make the changes and ask for forgiveness later. Good news tho BItcoin itself will stay intact and if a side chain fails we can always revert and replace with better side chains.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:47:46
Some nodes do that, they can only ban that peer or ignore from themselves, that is correct, but unless the miner does that too then the node doesn't prevent other nodes or miners seeing that transactions. 
Unless you are trying to push that initial transaction through that node. This is how wallet devs can test rule variances.

Good for them - they saw more value in Bitcoin Cash(in the future) so they mined at a current loss. Miners do this often. They expect the coins value will increase. Competition makes things better. Since the fork all I've heard about  is how much segwit is a failure. Maybe they should have fixed bitcoin properly before claiming victory. Bitcoin Cash is now operating, mostly, as an alt coin.  The market cap is being distributed and Bitcoin STILL drives the market - so still is and probably always will be the FATHER coin but who says BCC can't be MOM?

I remember this, it was against dice something and was due to multiple requests or a glitch in how the two companies worked together and was only a few tiny transactions. When cex.io/ghash.io had reached the 51% they even released statements assuring the community and purposely took equipment offline to reduce the hashrate.
Counterexample: ghash.io no longer exists because they paid premium prices for equipment and electricity and maintenance became more expensive than they could afford and ended up having to liquidate their inventory and focused on the cex.io exchange.

True would end up in multiple forks, but since miner consensus or even a community consensus was not reached using the bitcoin voting system failure would be inevitable. Compromise by humans wanting to see all of cryptocurrency survive is what allowed the UASF to work and not destroy the Network. Sadly, btc, as well as bch are working as intended. BTC will most likely win due to first mover advantage, but it will not be the Bitcoin everyone is hoping for. Side chains are great, but we have to remember these are in no way secure ore safe like btc. Hopefully we can work out all the bugs before the next wave of people come rushing in.

Andreas video luckily I have Google and was easy search: 
The papers are peer reviewed and basically agreed to, but you are correct scientific and mathematic supposition is only verified once truly tested. Since nobody(miners on bch or btc) wants to risk it we may never test these theories.
Every miner is a computer and mining pools come from very distinct static IP addresses it works the same way any firewall would exclude or include traffic. A simple exclusion script is added to all the good miners computers and the bad miner is an outcast. It is actually scarily easy.
Segwit doesn't really have anything to do with mining, other than it now excludes covert asic boost, so I'm not sure I understand what segwit has to do with this convo?
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:44:10
No, consensus has the power. Votes are provided by users as 1 vote per cpu. So non mining nodes have power during a consensus vote. The problem with that is each mining device also has 1 vote. Since one mining warehouse alone has thousands of miners they have more control over consensus unless every user spins up their own nodes and votes. Most users are that highly invested or just don't get it that is why miners,devs, exchanges, leaders usually control the consensus vote. 
Have you voted?

Perhaps for ipv6. Unless something better comes along? However, segwit is not inevitable, at all. There are many other technologies that could easily take its place. For that matter a completely different solution may be required due to lack of adoption. Since the malleabilty solution is required for certain 3rd party tech to run, it does have encouragement, but not inevitably. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:26:40
Well it looks like you made up your mind. Just know that BTC the way it was before segwit and LN was much easier to protect against dishonest mining.  makes it easier to doublespend by bringing the trick other miners into mining faux blocks. This could be done with a 31% attack.
The lightning network, was just ddosed bringing down 20% of the nodes. With very little effort. You will also have to hire 3rd party watchtowers to watch your transactions.
The LN will also have more centralization with channel factories. 
If you think you need a node because you can't trust 3rd party companies that have been recording and broadcasting(explorers) the data for years and agragation and warning sites that have also been doing it for years. 
How can you assume channel factories, watchtower and segwit will not be violated. Sorry to bust your bubble, but the amount of trust can only be based on incentivized actions.  Just like the Bitcoin network runs today with 5 to 10 added points of failure and many more attack vectors 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:20:44
The other miners stop the breaking of preexisting rules. The only way selfish miners can attack the network are mining empty blocks, double spends and tricking other miners into mining empty blocks while they doublespend a segwit blocks(easier to do and not trackable by nodes). The already existing software and the other 16+ mining pools will stop 1000 btc from magically being created.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:30:46
Because the SW the miners run reject it. They would require majority hashrate to pull of anything that breaks consensus rules. They do NOT or can not rewrite bitcoin(SW) and not be challenged by the other miners who are all running the correct bitcoin implementation. If that miner did it maliciously, and was able to mine enough of their own blocks, they would fork off the network and no longer be bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:41:03
Yes. And because the people were only given one choice, they are doing everything they can to avoid the upgrade. Plus new technologies came along that did not make it as important. Today, 12 to 15 connections can share a single ip address. Even places like Comcast/charter now use community modems in places like apartment complexes to avoid upgrading. Don't piss people off and force them into something they don't want they will do as much as they can and even spend more money to avoid doing it out of spite.

I never said nodes aren't useful. This is how block explorers get the data they use. They run nodes. I stated users running their own nodes is not useful. You don't need 12k nodes running to verify 20 mining pools aren't cheating. Block explorers verify. 3rd party sites monitor and alert if block explorer data goes wonky. Social media goes crazy if all miners are colluding bitcoin fails. Game theory if you act bad for short time personal gains the rest of the players who also have skin in the game fight back.
Even users running their own nodes could be useful if they knew how to use them. The majority used ran nodes do nothing but run in the background and waste electricity. If you do not monitor those nodes, set up alarms, and verify the data with 3rd party software keep the node up to date etc you are doing nothing.
Edit:addendum when nodes reject blocks they just ignore them. If you are not running specially designed software you wouldn't notice or even record it happened. If multiple blocks that break rules come in to a node and they are all getting rejected old nodes would disconnect you completely from the network and not even record future rejected blocks.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:43:33
Probably because your fee was too low. This seems to have fallen in the middle of the big run up so you fee got pushed to the bottom. Looks like after the average fee dropped again it went through. 
This is the problem with BTC s replace by fee. Every time btc gets popular again the fee price skyrockets and even tho it looks like you got in cheap by the time the block actually is mined the fee estimation could have tripled or quadrupled.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:35:25
Because blockexplorers are constantly reporting on the network. Within 10 minutes. If a miner did this, it would hit every Twitter/Reddit/facebook profile and the price would plummet. Luckily the other 16 to 18 miners would enforce consensus. Again you don't need the node to get an alert on your phone. You need the node to verify the multiple centralized block explorers all of a sudden decided to lie to the public.

They run specially designed software that tracks the network, txs, Mempool and every other little tidbit. There are just as many block explorers as mining pools. So even if they are centralized you can compare against multiple to verify any deviance.
 They personally don't look for anomalies but there are hundreds of other sites that use block explorer data to check for anomalies. 
These are all ran as businesses, if they stop doing their job they stop making money this is why you rely on thrm
