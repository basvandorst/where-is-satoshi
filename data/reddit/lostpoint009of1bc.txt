Supply isn't decreasing. Mining is going on everyday. BC is like every other artificial currency, it isn't finite. Gold is finite, we can't replicate or create gold. We can replicate man made currency. 
Don't get me wrong, BC won't become worthless. There will always be fluctuations. Easy example - The U.S. dollar. Two years ago v the Euro the dollar was dead. Now the Dollar isn't so dead the Euro. But long term, BC is going to continue to become less valued.
The demand will help but as long as new BCs come out the supply increases. 
Just like the dollar - the FED keeps printing the dollar out year after year. As more dollars come out, the less worth we find in the dollar. 
This is one reason why movies today cost 15$ and bread cost 2$ when 30 years ago movies cost 1$ and bread cost .20cents.

Someones flooding the market in BC right now and shorting them hard. Anyone trying to sell right now is toast unless they're willing to drop to his and his prices or go below.
There would even be people out there desperately buying to keep the price up.
See Trading Places for a good example of this rise/fall buy/sell.
Be happy you didn't "buy from day one" or you'd be looking at a massive hit.
Say you have 20k bc. The price drops 20$ in two days. Down 400k. Now imagine being someone who bought at $1300 and held on to those 20k bc hoping good times would return.
BC are like every other currency. Over time the value will drop because more of the currency will come into circulation. As more of the currency comes into circulation the currency becomes less valued.
Next year BC will be $138, year after $53. There will be bumps of course, but generally the value will slowly but steadily decline.
**edit** ~~When I started this post BC was 275.6, after posting I checked price again and its ~~272.03~~ 270.9 (it dropped almost 2 bucks just typing this edit)
**edit two** Seems a lot of people don't know how currency markets work. Whatever.
So the supposed bc wallet with the stolen funds sits as 43,083.
Two days ago when the gank occurred bc was about 291 and those funds were worth 12,537,153. As of now, prices are 266 and dropping. The 12,537,153 is down to 11,460,078.
That wallet has lost over 1m in 2 days. **If** that wallet is the Evo wallet, take a small amount of joy they're losing money fast. The best thing that could happen right now for all wanting revenge is for a dramatic crash in BC prices.
Everyone is trying to sell, nobody is buying. The price will drop, and whatever they stole keeps losing value. Small consolation for a lot of people, and truly terrible for honest investors, but currency speculation is a risky bet in the first place.
