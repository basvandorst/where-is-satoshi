Counterparty has more highly skilled devs, a more committed community, and fairer distribution than any of the other crypto 2.0 coins.

And the race is on!  Counterparty, Mastercoin, and Colored Coin are in the blocks!  And he gun has sounded...  they are off ... errr... at least they should be off.  It appears Mastercoin and Colored Coin are struggling to leave the gates. Finally Colored Coin makes a move ... but forward progress appears to be slow.  And, oh, whats that ... a late entrant to the race, it is Counterparty ... Counterparty shoots out of the gates and quickly blows past the others to take the lead! Wow, who would have predicted this folks? And we're into the first mile of a 26 mile coding and regulatory marathon with Counterparty running laps around the others. Who will be the winner?  Nobody knows.  But I know this folks, 2014 is set to be an exciting year for the evolution of the "value web"!  Its not just an "information web" anymore ... Hold onto your seats! Place your bets!

The Counterparty devs are incredible.  They are coding at a record-setting pace.  This system has so much potential.  
If bitcoin protocol is like TCP/IP, then Counterparty is like http:// protocol.  The rest of the "value web" will be built on top of this Counterparty layer, in the same way that the rest of the internet was built on top of http:// .

The stealth launch of Counterparty by an anonymous creator feels consistent with the launch of Bitcoin itself!

Asset Backed Coins are Here!  
* Peer-to-Peer
* Asset-backed.
* Rides on Bitcoin blockchain.
Many assets are listed: 
See an example: CrudeOil:  Via the Counterparty Protocol.
The Counterparty Team just went ahead and wrote their own stuff, doing what Colored Coins, NxT and Mastercoin failed to do these past 6 – 9 months. Not even Ripple has assets like these issued and trading.
The Counterparty team is insanely good.

Just like AirB&amp;B re-utilized excess housing capacity in the world, and Uber re-utilized excess automobile capacity in the world, this could be the first-step towards re-utilizing all of the excess clothing capacity in the world.  I mean, you would need a scannable, unique ID in the items in order to start a clothing rental company at a major airport.  Yes, progress is always a terrible thing.  :)

Being cautious and asking tough due diligence questions is a virtue.  Nevertheless the proposed 'rogue employee' scenario is practically impossible. 
Here's why...
Chips are created in volumes of millions of units with automated machinery and algorithmic generation of keys added to the Secure Element.  Then the chips are purchased by the Brands to be associated with their branded products, also in large volumes. This two-stage operation means that at time of manufacture the silicon chip company (and the rogue employee who works for the silicon chip company) has no idea what specific branded product a given chip is going to be affixed to / associated with on Blockchain.  So even if it was possible for an employee at the silicon chip company to somehow create a chip with a duplicate private key contained in the secure element, how would the rogue employee know which counterfeit product to manufacture and embed the fake chip into? 
With wide adoption by the Brands this solution does make it impossible for counterfeiters to compete with real Brands and passing off counterfeits as authentic items becomes a thing of the past.

Dr_Teeth you are correct that the large majority of  RFID, NFC, and BLE chips out in the world can be scanned and the contents copied and added to a clone chip.
But, in the last couple of years a lot of progress has been made on chips that contain a "Secure Element" to protect the content of the chip, which solves the problem and can protect quite a high threshold of value.
This part of the industry is growing rapidly, see:

UPDATE: My $10k wired in mid November still hasn't shown up with BTC-e.  My US Bank performed a "trace" and has confirmed the money was received by the Deutche Bank account belonging to Mayzus.  BTC-e continues to ignore my ticket requests.
I am working on getting a Money Polo account from Mayzus, as a way of tracking down whether or not Mayzus still has the funds. 
Anyone else on here with updates on BTC-e deposits? On dealing with Mayzus?

AFTER MORE 30 DAYS OF WAITING MY FUNDS FINALLY SHOWED UP IN MY BTC-e ACCOUNT.  THANK YOU BTC-e!

Dear Senator,
Thanks for reaching out!  Here are a couple of important lessons that I've learned about bitcoin since I started trading it six months ago:
 1. It is BOTH a store of wealth and a payment system.  Gold and cash are only stores of wealth, you needed a horse or FedEX to transport sizable quantities.  Visa and Paypal are only payment systems, you need to have an account with fiat currency to use them. Bitcoin is BOTH!  Store of wealth and payment system rolled into one!  Hugely innovative!
 2. The core innovation of bitcoin is the "bitcoin protocol" which enables 1000s of distributed computers to authenticate trades of scarcely-available bitcoins via a public ledger.  This discovery is equal in importance to the TCP/IP protocol, otherwise known as the "internet protocol".
 3. Prediction: This core innovation will lead to the creation of a new "financial internet" equal in importance to the original internet, the social internet, or the mobile internet. There will be 1000s of new businesses built-on-top of this core innovation. America needs to be the center of this innovation!  Not the laggard!

My bank tells me that the money has been wired and is now in the Deutchebank system.  Any other ideas?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:14:30
How do you know it takes 30 days?  Where did you hear this?  Please provide more details.

GOOD NEWS - AFTER MORE THAN 30 DAYS OF WAITING MY MONEY SHOWED UP IN BTC-e ACCOUNT.  THANK YOU BTC-e!

1980-90s: PCs, TCP/IP protocol -&gt; birth of the "internet"
2000s: Facebook, LinkedIn* -&gt; birth of the "social internet"
2010s: mobile devices -&gt; birth of the "mobile internet"
2010-2020: 2 factor authentication, Bitcoin protocol -&gt; birth of the "financial internet"
*To other Reddit users: what was the key underpinning innovation that gave birth to social internet?  Was social internet merely a milestone in UX? SaaS model?

The really weird thing is that BTC-e has been almost totally unresponsive even after I've filed several technical support tickets.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:01:41
I have the same problem.  See: 
I have posted 10 or 20 tickets and no response from BTC-e technical support whatsoever.
It does seem plausible that BTC-e is selectively scamming.

Fabulous post, best bitcoin related item I've seen on reddit in past few weeks.

Thanks 3legged.  My bank told me that once the receiving bank has the money as per the initial Funds Transfer Authorization it is impossible to simply "recall" a wire transfer, although  it is possible to file a "Fraud / Dispute Claim".  Just curious, did you file a "Fraud Claim", or did you have some other mechanism of getting the money back from Mayzus?
