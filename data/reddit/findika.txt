So... it's been a good few years now. What am I seeing? After 10 years, this IS the most exciting time for bitcoin. From nothing to over $6000 - das some impressive moving. There was even a few big spikes along the way and one of em almost $20k!! That'll tell you what kind of price this thing can hit when it's not even finished finding its legs. If we're too stupid to ignore signs like that then we deserve to miss out is what I'm sayin here.
Look at what's happened with the price over these years with nothing going on. I'm so f stoked to see what's gonna hapen in the next few years now that there's real shit happening!!
Ya'll ready for another November to remember? A 2019 that rocks the foundations? Don't let the calm before the storm fool ya people. This is how bitcoin price moves .. the calmer and quieter it gets, the bigger the storm that follows.

Yes but only if you are able to buy and sell at the same time. Or if you have enough funds to split them in btc and usd.

Cryptography generally works according to the principle of trusting everyone as little as possible, and most parts of the Bitcoin protocol works without trusting any miners. Every single piece of Bitcoin is verifiable by each and every node. If you send me bitcoins I can verify for myself that you owned those bitcoins, that you followed all agreed upon rules and that your digital signature is valid. I don't need a miner to do any of that for me. Miners are only needed for resolving double spends (solving the Byzantine Generals Problem), so that is the only power they were given. Giving them more power than that would be going against a core principle of IT security, the Principle of Least Privilege
A miner with 50%+ is still limited in what he can do. He can't change Bitcoin, he can't steal coins and he can't create new coins. He can only rewrite history and double spend coins, and perform attacks that follows from this (such as censoring certain transactions).
If it was any other way, Satoshi would have never even talked about double spending. If anyone who overpowers the network could change the protocol of Bitcoin however he wanted, then double spending would be the least of our problems.

It can be done, but you must be able to move your funds fast between btc and usd.
