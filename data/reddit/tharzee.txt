Always try to catch the falling knife.  You can't go wrong

I'm so tired of that site.  Their bet hosting rewards and lack of moderation encourage duplicate bets, which effectively kill off the original.
Even the mods say "well the old one was time weighted and discourages late betting" which is the goddamn point of parimutuel bets.  Later votes have more information and are worth less

What's productive about that?  The price falling might indicate an issue that should be discussed but jerking ourselves off over every bounce in price is a waste of time

That's a dumb thing to say.  I'm perfectly free to choose my exchange and give preference to financial freedom and financial privacy.  
I know exactly the difficulty and risks involved in a breach.  That's no excuse to give up and make all your information public.
The bank is the party liable and insured for fraud.

Coinbase never asked for picture ID, passport, drivers license... 
Also it may benefit their compliance department, but it adds no security for me or them.  Dwolla, paypal, and coinbase never needed this, so it's not a government requirement.  It's just more information out there that can be hacked.

That's going to alienate a lot of people

I think people would pay money for faster/more downloads and uploaders of popular files may be rewarded with bitcache

Doesn't circle ask for a whole bunch of personal ID like drivers license

Can we afford to do that at this point in the adoption curve?  
Given that the resource limitation is artificial long before it's technological, do you agree with the current limit?
