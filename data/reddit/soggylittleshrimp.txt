I bought your BCH at $3800 ��

Long Bitcoin, short The Donald
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:38:01
It’s the word of the president. 
Trump is officially anti-Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:26:30
Sort of like how people abandoned morals to support Trump.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:55:25
I’m voting for a pro-Bitcoin candidate in 2020. 
Trump is anti-Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:25:02
The dad is making a joke
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:08:14
This kid became a millionaire over the summer and today it's just under 8 million. 403 BTC
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:36:31
He could say nothing at all. Nobody forced Trump to come out as anti-Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:22:51
No, we get it. He’s a genius marketer, a genius media manipulator. This will be his legacy, not leadership or diplomacy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:06:33
So does that number play into futures trading at all? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:09:08
What happens if you send to an address that doesn't exist?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:38:33
If I’m using Coinbase should I only pay attention to that exchange (which is GDAX?). Or should I look at the average too?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:34
Are you speculating or is that fact?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:31:15
Save in a traditional fund in addition to something uncertain like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:58:10
Its worth thinking about. It’s nice to have some cash and some boring traditional funds out there too. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:21:21
Why is it critical to know what blockchain tech is? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:27:31
What’s the buzz on those?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:39:14
Are u from the future 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:28:00
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:41:36
His tweets don’t move markets anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:54
They just blew right past it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:58
I recently quit all politics on Reddit and it’s sad to see the same behavior happening between these crypto subs, like it’s r/politics and the donald. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:17:10
I'm feeling grand envy
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:45:33
That’s the reason I bought Litecoin the other day. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:45:18
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:06:44
Try doing some small trades in GDAX to get a feel for how it works. There are some good YouTube videos that walk you through it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:49:29
Christian Bale did. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:34:49
For the same reason they put the dollar sign *after* the numeral. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:50:51
What about taking out enough to float you through an event like you mentioned - medical or job loss. Whatever that number is you could extract and have the peace of mind that feels so good and still have a lot of coin to play with. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:11:46
Maybe 23000 ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:53:38
I was skeptical and said exactly this 2 or 3 years ago (and did not buy then). 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:26:22
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:06:48
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:16:38
That's why I think there's room for a ubiquitous currency (such as Libra) or off chain solutions like Lightning.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:44:08
This is the most interesting part, perhaps. FB has a reach of over 2 Billion people and could give them the easiest route to buying BTC.
Even just a dedicated site to atomic swap LBR to BTC would be very interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:39:24
I have 26 XRP and 834 Tron am I gonna make it??
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:03:15
Or trust through network connections I believe? Like if you wanted to pay the taxi and there was an existing, non-direct, payment channel it would work?
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:29:17
It means that Bitcoin (or something like it) with a limited supply could be a “hard money” like gold once was.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:34:18
As an American who has lived in Europe, the social benefits are very good for society. The overall levels of contentment in people is much higher than Americans. 
Some reasonably priced health care and child care would do wonders in America and reduce the low level anxiety most of us have.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:33:07
But maybe it should. The monetary system is out of control with schemes wrapped in schemes.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:16:07
Trump supporters extremely butt hurt by this comment.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:59:36
He said BTC could replace the role that gold once had, not replace gold.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:08:21
It will reduce the schemes that are put in place to make money in an inflationary system. Why are half the lights in Manhattan never on? Because (among other more nefarious reasons) people park money in real estate rather than hold currency because the currency will go down in spending power over time and real estate will increase in value. This opens the door to bigger schemes, like a $40 million home becoming a $100 million home in just 4 years. 
In a system based on an established digital currency with a finite supply, the spending power of that currency will remain stable. This potentially has so many positive outcomes for society, it’s really eye opening.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:15:25
Yes, but like a gold that can be spent as easily as a dollar, without the need for a paper note as the intermediary. 
It all remains to be seen of course, but a return to hard money could have many many benefits beyond just how you pay for coffee.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:05:57
fubgibiity 
I love it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:14:29
Surely that will NEVER happen ;)
