It's reddit I'm surprised we made it this far in the top comment chain without somebody bringing religion or donald trump into it.

I still can't decide what I want more. To be rich or for John McAfee to eat his dick. 
I really wanna be rich but I find myself leaning towards wanting him to eat his dick.

Yeah I can buy just about anything off amazon with my bitcoin. 
And until I can spend it everywhere else I can just buy fiat with profits to spend.

Paper wallets are supposedly* the most secure besides hardware wallets. 
*I say supposedly because I don't really know for sure.

The more transaction fee you pay the quicker transactions are

Brainwallet is the most secure wallet. Unless you live somewhere with a lot of psychics.

I don't think this video troubling you has much to do with where you bought tbh.

It's really hard to ignore it once you've pointed it out.

@_date: 2017-09-02 06:22:03
Yeah damn like spot on
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:27:37
Yeah not quite a scam as much as a shitty exchange rate. The cheapest one in my city is 8%.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:51:30
Yep I agree 100%.

Is there anything about bitcoin that restricts us from basically using more decimal places? I understand we can't do that with today's system but if this problem came up it doesn't SEEM like a big issue to a non-programmer like myself. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:55:14
Lol gtfo with your high and mighty bullshit

Governments provide value to society. Social services, maintaining roads, etc. I don't particularly want that to end. But I also like the idea of bitcoin and I really like the money I've made in bitcoin.
I'm not saying I love my government, no government is perfect. But I am 100% anti anarchy and I am also pro bitcoin.

I'm 22 and fairly new to crypto, been into it since july (got my first btc super cheap simply due to luck lmao) and I still feel like there's so much more to understand about bitcoin and blockchain. Super interesting and I have the basics down I'd say but there's so much to the whole process it seems 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:12:13


No we're just pro bitcoin. Some might be anarchists. But that is far from a prerequisite

Yeah kinda how Canada (and I think many other places) uses imperial system for body measurement (height, weight) but metric basically everywhere else

Something about money
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:09:14
Yeah when bitcoins didn't have near as much value as they do today. Before most people who know about them had ever heard or read the word bitcoin.
