Interesting. How do you find your private key?

If you don't mind me asking, do I understand this properly?
It seems like they're offering a web wallet, and some sort of text confirmation. If I were selling bitcoins, the seller would hand me cash and I'd text localbitcoins some sort of confirmation number, and then funds would be dragged out of my localbitcoins wallet and added to the buyer's?

What the hell happened to this thread? Computer flame wars are silly.
The more blocks mined at a faster pace, the more difficulty will rise. This is true for all coins. Personally, bitcoin mining is less profitable to me than mining alt coins, and I'm sure it is for other people with rigs not designed for any specific coin. This is because a lot of alt coins are in early stages, and bitcoins have been around for a long time. With more ASICs out, some people will be forced to move away from BTC. 
This doesn't mean BTC is bad. *Jeeze people.*
Also, I don't see why people are distraught about this being on I'm not OP, but tell me why?

Weren't the few devices early-stage consoles that didn't hit requirements?

I am the keeper of my wallet.

What should I do to secure wallets with small amounts of BTC? I read through the wiki but I'm a bit confused. Can I just encrypt it and make sure my computer is clean and be done, and then just back up wallet.dat via Dropbox or something, and when I load up the backup will the client sync me to the proper amount of BTC or would I have lost BTC?

Of course all my PPCoin sat there while the prices plummetted.
