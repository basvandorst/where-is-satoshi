Also, first post, not sure I did it right ! Hooray!
Backstory: saw the post a few days ago about Beautiful Taiwan Tea Company embracing Bitcoin and I had to support them. I'm not a tea aficionado out anything but the payment process was seamless, it arrived quickly, and it tastes good to me. Just wanted to spread the love again, I think I'll be buying more as gifts!

As an immigration scholar and bitcoin enthusiast, I love this. Remittances were one of my first thoughts when I learned about BTC, and I'm hoping to make it a research project in the near future. 
Can you possibly include "conventional" remittance conduits in your comparisons? (Western Union, etc.) That would help the layman understand why it makes sense to go with a BTC-based system. For example, "You'd save 20% by using these Bitcoin exchanges rather than using Moneygram." I'd be willing to gather some pricing info to help you with that :)
