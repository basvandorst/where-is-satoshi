That is not how you trade correctly.  You set limit buys and sells in advance

they would in the long term as they have value beyond bitcoin. Bitcoin going away isn't going to kill all altcoins forever.

the reason its profitable  is because markets are inefficient.  That is,  they are subject to human psychological forces.  People like to buy at the top and sell at the bottom.  This means that prices always raise further than they should, and fall further than they should.

thats the thing that people dont get.  even successful traders have something like a 50% success rate.  No one is predicting anything.  Its simply laying out possibilities,  and gambling on one.
the thing that makes traders profitable is that they stand to gain more than they lose,  on average,  across many trades.   They risk a low enough amount on each one so that statisically, over many trades,  their account is like a drill.  Slowly growing but never receding significantly. They rely on exponential compound growth instead of big wins.     Anyone who bets everything on a big move or acts like they know everything is either an idiot or a liar.

Bitcoin is now 1/2000  of the entire worlds wealth.
So say you buy 500 dollars of bitcoin.  If somehow bitcoin magically replaces all possessions, homes, goods, services, gold, stocks, fiat, etc.
Then you will have 1 million dollars :)
Good luck buddy
