If they have some skill or service or product they believe has some value to someone, they can trade that for bitcoin.
It's really the same question as "how can people without cash or a bank account get cash?" Find someone with bitcoin or cash and paint their fence, suck their dick, operate on their heart, or write a story you think they will like, in exchange for an agreed amount of their bitcoin or cash.

Doubt it, the shitcoin market isn't about technology, use case, or potential real world adoption, it's about trying to guess how high the green number goes before it turns red. How many people that bought LKV or SSK or Electrinocoin could tell you one thing about them other than "went up 12% since last Tuesday"? Maybe 2% of people? Any advances to bitcoin don't effect that. If KKK goes up 41% in a week because it's been premined and pumped like fuck, people will trade the shit out of Klancoin. 
I mean for the love of God Bitconnect BCC has jumped back up another 300% or something after crashing to nothing and it being widely reported in the media that the well known, blatantly fucking obvious scam, finally exit scammed, after being hounded out of Dodge by the SEC. People are still gobbling it up, because who cares if it's a scam, you can still gamble with the tokens. 
(Same goes for the bitcoin market a bit tbh, but bitcoin also has the other three things to be taken into account as well).

Does that makes sense though? What cheap, fast reliable transactions are being done through most of the alts money floods into? Like, is Neblio up 80% today because everyone is using it to buy coffee, or send their nephew in Australia money cheaply, quickly and reliably? Or are people just hopping on different alts and then trying to guess the peak to sell at before it tumbles back down?
(I've nothing against Neblio btw, I know nothing about it, maybe it's awesome. But I think its pretty safe today it's not going up like crazy today because people think it's a faster, cheaper and more reliable way to transfer value).
I'm not "anti alts" or anything like that. I think it's really fucking cool that people are coming up with all these neat ideas and possible applications of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. It's really exciting and nice to see, even if 90% or more will probably never get off the ground in any real way, and a lot will never be anything other than vague ideas in reality. Some of then ideas are still cool.
But c'mon man, most of them going up has absolutely nothing to do with anything about bitcoin, or even the coin itself. It's just roulette table stuff. Nothing wrong with that either, I'm sure it's great fun, and if you get lucky you can make some nice money. But let's not play pretend it's anything other than that in the vast majority of cases.

Are there any possible steps a user can take individually to strengthen the privacy while using the network? Is there some way of interacting on it that would lessen the risk of deanonymisation (?) for the user?
If a user falls back on best practices for pseudoanonymity in relation to the initial address they fund a channel with, the 'decloaking' would finalize to the same point that identifying a user on the base chain would? Would that be right? If an adversary peels the layers off the onion they would arrive at the same conclusions they would arrive at if they just focused on an address and it's transactions on the main chain? Or am I way off?
Say an adversary identifies that node A sent transaction B, they then have the bitcoin address of node A? But then it defaults back to the pseudoanonymity of the address that funded node A?

I can imagine three possibilities.
1. People that seem heavily emotionally invested (why, I can't get my head around yet) in the myth that bitcoin has no utility, being annoyed at yet another example of it's utility increasing.
2. People that are heavily invested in an alternative cryptocurrency with extensive smart contract utility being annoyed that bitcoin will soon have something similar too.
3. People that are opposed to Rootstock because it is federated (less decentralised) expressing their dislike of it. (But in this case surely it would make more sense to upvote it for visibility and then explain their objections in the comments? But that doesn't seem to be how Reddit is generally used).
I'd bet mainly 1 with a sprinkling of 2.

Surely the obvious option would be for exchanges to just have an option "fund lightning channel" once the LN is in full swing? It's how the majority of people get bitcoin anyway, buying in an exchange they have an account with. So instead of withdrawing your balance to your standard address, paying the miners fee and waiting X amount of blocks, you'd just withdraw what you needed to your LN channel, for tiny LN fee and instantly, to then be used in the LN. If your channel runs almost dry again, you just make another purchase through the exchange like you always do and click the "Fund LN Channel" option again. You win by not having to make a standard tx (with fees and wait times) if you want to use the bitcoin you've purchased, and they win by ensuring you always use their exchange for your purchases rather than a competitor.

We already know that's untrue. Bitcoin has always had huge volatility, and may have skyrocketed (or crash landed) in price. And people did spend it. Always. That theory has been tested in the wild for 9 years, since bitcoin came into existence, and completely disproven.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:49:33
I suppose a few things need to be taken into consideration. The article states that that's large visa data centre, is one of two in the US that handle the majority of visas data. They say it uses 2% of the electricity the bitcoin network does. It is the largest one, so let's presume the other centre uses 1.5 % of the bitcoin network. That's 3.5%. Visa processes 50% of the global card payments excluding China. So Visa plus the rest of the card payment processing outside of China we can estimate to be about 7%. China Union pay  surpassed Visa as the largest card payment processer in the world in 2015. So let's assume CUP uses 10% more than Visa. That means we'll estimate CUP's usage at another 3.8%. This brings us to 10.8%. This is just data processing electricity usage. 
We'd then have to factor in the energy usage apart from the data centre processing. The largest visa data processing centre mentioned in the article has 130 employees - visa employs 12,600 employees globally. If we presume a similar proportional relationship as we did with the data centres, that would mean, visa plus the other processers that make up the other 50% excluding China, plus CUP, would be somewhere in the region 38,000 employees globally, and we would have to account for the electricity usage of these carrying out their various operations, and arrive at a total figure to take into account, to compare to the bitcoin network.
Then we have to consider that bitcoin to card payment processors isn't a one to one comparison. As the bitcoin network potentially also disrupts the gold industry, with it's mining, transportation, accounting etc to some degree. And also would include some degree of disruption to the banking sector, with it's payment processing, cash movement, security and storage, data processing and operational energy usage.
For a like for like comparison, we'd need to estimate the energy consumption of all of these things, and then estimate the incresing energy consumption of the bitcoin network as it disupts all of these various things. Then to arrive at some figure for any additional energy usuage of the bitcoin network, we would need to subtract the combined total reduction of energy consumption of the above things that the bitcoin network has replaced.
So, if we imagine at some point in the future bitcoin replaces 50% of card payment processing, 50% of banking operations, and 50% of gold as a store of value, we must find a figure for those three amounts of energy consumption combined, and estimate the energy usage of the bitcoin network scaled to that level, then subtract one from the other to find the difference.
The electricity used by one Visa data centre in the US vs the current electricity consumption of the bitcoin network, can't really tell us much if we want to start considering what kind of environmental impact, positive, negative or neutral the bitcoin network could have if it is used as a major global currency in the future.
You need to account for the current environmental effects of the things bitcoin would be disrupting, assuming that kind of massive adoption.
How much additional energy usage resulted from the global adoption of credit and debit cards? How large was the reduction in energy usage from the reduction in bank transfers, physical cash movement, check processing, etc?
What was the increase in energy expenditure from the global adoption of the internet? What was the reduction in terms of its replacement of the amount of paper and magnetic tapes, cds, dvds, physical film production, replication, transportation, sending paper letters before email, and so forth?
I haven't the slightest clue. But this is how the energy consumption of the mass adoption of the bitcoin network, and then environmental impact of that, needs to be considered.

Warren Buffet has said repeatedly for 40 years that he doesn't invest in technology because he doesn't understand it, and he only invests in things he understands.

This is the hope, that exchanges (or whoever) will have a channel and youncan buy (or exchange something of value for) bitcoin from them and have them route it to you via lightning, so you won't have to open a new channel.
But, you can't (well shouldn't) let the channel run completely dry. You need to keep at least some small amount of bitcoin in it. Otherwise there would be no way for your channel partner to penalise you should you try and cheat by publishing a balance that isn't the latest one. So if you let it run completely to 0, your channel partner will probably close it on you.
Edit: probably would have to be more than whatever one low fee on chain transaction would cost?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:53:20
The size of a transaction in bytes is related the the number of inputs and outputs. As fees are in Satoshi per byte, a 250  byte fee will cost half as much as a 500 byte fee.The more inputs and outputs, the larger the bytes. Every time an account recieves X amount of bitcoin, that's one more output it has received. Your account balance is shown as one figure - 4.144btc or whatever - but that is made up of every output it has received into it. So if that account recieved in one 4 bitcoin transaction and one 0.144btc transaction, then to send on the full balance of that account, then that transaction would have two outputs. If it had of recieved that amount into it in 4144 different transactions of 0.001 btc, then it would have 4144 outputs when trying to move the whole balance to a different wallet. 4144 outputs means way way more bytes than 2 outputs, so a fee set at 100sat/byte would be a lot less expensive for the one that recieved the bitcoin into the account in two chunks, than the one that recieved it into the account in 4144 chunks.
In think this may be the difference you are seeing?

Better is to start with "it's not really about the price of it on some market, it's not a stock, its not something to bet on to try and make money, that's not the point. Remember when Wikileaks were basically blacklisted by the financial system, that didn't just happen once, to them, you know, it's happened to many others... that's kind of the point. 
You think Donald Trump is bad? He's just the current guy. No one saw that coming right? The next guy could be anyone. Maybe that guy doesn't like your thing that you like? Yeah, now they can't receive any funding. 
Bitcoin is a way around that. It means no one but you gets to decide who, or where, or when, or why you get to send money to someone else. It means if the next guy decides the EFF doesn't get to recieve funding, people can still fund them. 
It means if the next guy decides your children living in another country because this one has become too dangerous, aren't allowed to recieve money from you for food and shelter, you can still provide food and shelter for them. 
It means if the next guy decides that you can't donate to the other guy, you can still donate. 
It means that you have a choice over what happens with your money. It means no one can take it, and no one can stop you sending it to anyone else.
Bitcoin is a hedge against one of the most fundamental forms of freedom of expression being stripped from you at a moment's notice. The ability to transfer the value you have earned by contributing to society, to something or someone else you think will contribute  to society, from being stripped away from you with zero notice. You fuck.
You're what's wrong with the world. You specifically. Look, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Now quit being part of the fucking problem and put the other guy back on".

In can think of a couple of use cases off the top.
1. Sending money to Wikileaks or any other present or future censored recipient.
2. If you wanted to remain pseudanonymous. Didn't want your gf to see on the CC bill/ bank account statement, that you purchased an engagement ring / a sex robot.
3. Micropurchases (needs functioning lightning network). So anywhere where "minimum purchase required" due to CC fees etc is an issue. Or possibly other, as yet unavailable micropurchase applications (paying for streamed content by the fraction of a cent etc).
4. Where counterparty risk is a bigger (perhaps unnaceptable) risk for whoever is the reciever of payment, than the sender for a particular transaction to take place.

You don't seem to want to hear why people want to use it. You seem more interested in trying to tell people why they are wrong for wanting to use it. If you don't want to use it, don't use it. But you're going to have a hard time telling people that are getting utility from something, that they are wrong to get utility from it, because you can't understand the utility they get from it. It's the equivalent of my partners grandfather standing outside a phone shop yelling at the customers inside that they have no idea why anyone would want to use a smartphone. A couple of them take the time to try to explain the utility to him, and he goes back to yelling that that no one has any idea why anyone would want to use one. Everyone using it has an idea why people would want to use it. This is why those people use it. You seem to want to ignore that and claim nobody has any idea why anybody would want to use it. You should just continue to believe what you want to believe in this case.

It does until the difficulty adjusts back up? Higher hashrate at the same difficulty means shorter average block discovery times, each new block contains a new batch of transactions processed. A 1mb block every five minute means ~twice the transaction processing speed of a 1mb block every ten minutes, all else being equal?

Being familiar with the development work, and estimating the ability of the people involved, would it be right to think that it's unlikely that making innacurate claims such as the ones you've brought up would be a matter of incompetence (if that's not too harsh a term), and therefore  would have to be considered deliberately dishonest or misleading claims?

Same advice as always. 
- Only invest what you can afford to lose. There's a lot of factors in play and no one knows how anything is going to ultimately play out. Don't invest money you will likely need to access in the immediate future. Don't panic sell at a loss if the price dips, zoom out, and relax, maybe it never goes back up, but that would be the first time that's ever happened, and you've only invested what you can afford to lose anyway, so whatevs. 
- Only listen to people that have demonstrated a genuine understanding of the technology, about what bitcoin is or isn't, or will be or can be. Every time there is a new technological breakthrough that gains the interest of the general public, people that don't understand it feel the need  to try and dismiss or ridicule it and it's early advocates and adopters. Happened with the automobile, happened with the internet. Some people feel stupid when they can't understand something, that hurts their ego and makes them want to lash out at the thing and the people that do understand it. People are strange.
- Have fun. Bitcoin is magic internet money created by a mysterious faceless man that popped into existence and then back out again just as quick. There's forks and spoons and dips and crashes and the moon and the stars and cyphers and whales and probably a dragon in there somewhere. Its bleeding edge, potentially world changing technology unfolding infront of everyone's eyes in real time and anyone that wants to can have a stake in it, and anyone can contribute something positive to it if they wish. It's exciting, it's an adventure, don't get all caught up with the people and their drama that want to make it into some kind of a bitchy and dull schoolyard fight.
Have fun, be sensible, play nice, best of luck.

Crypto's main value proposition is that it is censorship resistent. When used to its full potential it provides a way to store and transfer value without permission or interference. 
A way to be the only one with control of that value. To limit the impact of coercion on the expression of that control. Value autonomy. Debit cards and clever banking apps do not offer these things.
Is this alone enough of an incentive for 'the average person' to adopt it? Not the average wealthy person in a highly stable (as far as they are aware) geopolitical and socioeconomic situation right now, anyway, I'd guess. As things continue to develop, and cyrpto continues to match and surpass the alternatives in areas like ease of use, speed and cost of transaction, etc, then people become more and more incentivised to adopt it. 
There are no clever banking apps that do instant online or P2P payments, only clever apps that provide the feel of doing those things. When a censorship resistent alternative that actually does them, and faster and cheaper than the lagacy attempts, and (potentially) gains value rather than being guaranteed to slowly lose it, is an option, more and more of the "average people" should adopt it, I'd guess. People want to be autonomous, even average people, so much as they have the ability to be.
Autonomy is the ability choose for one's self. Cryptocurrency is the means by which we hope to secure for the average person, the ability to choose for themselves, as average people, how their storable and transferable value is stored and transferred, free from coercion. It's a work in progress. It didn't begin with Satoshi Nakamoto or Bitcoin. 
Progress is moving irreversibly forward.
It may take a bit of time, but this isn't a panicked mad dash of a land grab for market share, there is only the relentless transfer of market share in one direction. Maybe it'll stall at a certain point, maybe not. If it does it will be a temporary moment in steady forward movement, as it always has been. We'll just have to wait and see, interesting times. :)

I don't really know anything about markets, trading and all that stuff.
Could someone ELI5 for me how "wallstreet" would be deliberately driving the price down to win on futures (I keep seeing people allude to this)? I mean, I get that whoever is short (some wallstreet guys) stands to benefit from the price going down. But for each person in a futures contract that is short, their has to be someone on the other side of the contract (some wallstreet guys) that are long, right? It's zero sum. One wallstreet guy wins, and the other loses?  So how would the short wallstreet guys be manipulating the price down? Wouldn't the long wallstreet guys in the other side of the contract be doing whatever the opposite is to manipulate the price up? No?

If every Chinese mining rig spontaneously combusted right now, and every Chinese miner spontaneously melted, every miner outside of China would mine the bitcoin that those miners would have mined if not for all the spontaneous melty combusting. That wouldn't by any means cripple the network. If China disappears in a giant sinkhole tonight, all that happens is the difficulty adjusts down to reflect that, and the coins that were previously mined from China would instead be mined from everywhere else. The network would just keep ticking away, as if nothing happened. Every ten minutes on average a new 1mb block would be mined, just like before the giant sinkhole incident, just not by anyone in China, cause they are all in the bottom of the sinkhole, and there's really shitty WiFi down there.
If every single bitcoin miner kills themselves tonight, by beating themselves to death with their mining rig, destroying it in the process, except one of them, that one non suicidal miner, will still mine one block on average every 10 minutes, and the network will tick away, just like before.
To cripple the bitcoin network, you have to stop every miner, everywhere, all at once, forever.

I never said bitcoin wasn't volatile. I said the opposite. I said it's always been very volatile. I said it's a completely disproven claim that people won't spend it because it is volatile. It's always been volatile. People have always spent it. This isn't a matter of opinion we can argue over. There's only reality.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:16:21
I think I probably disagree that the value would drop if the coins start to move. "Satoshi Lives!!! Mysterious Bitcoin founder is still amongst us - and he's back in the game". Massive volatility, sure, but a huge sell off... I'm not convinced, could easily spur on the opposite. Maybe if it starts flooding into an exchange as a giant sell wall - but just shifting around... pandemonium, hype, buzz, interest, intrigue - that doesn't spell sell off to me.

Gambling is just admitting you're not psychic and not crippled by risk adversity.
You either gamble or live in a bubble... except living in a bubble is a pretty huge gamble.
There's no way out. If you breathe air, you're a gambler. Just accept it.

Will merchants not have to regularly close channels in order to exchange the bitcoin to fiat? I can't see too many being willing to just hodl bitcoin, particularly not in a hot wallet, but also not at all really. So they'll be closing channels once a week maybe?Then making another tx on chain to move it to an exchange to sell it for fiat. Then another to reopen a channel to take more lightning transactions? That's a lot of extra on chain txs presuming any kind of adoption at all? 
The more I've been thinking about it recently the more I'm inclined to think the same as rain-is-wet. Presuming any kind of increased bitcoin adoption brought on by lightning, I cant really see how there is going to be anything other than a proportional increase in onchain tx's, and therefore increased congestion and increased fees. 
At least with this version of LN. I hope they have a lot of tricks up their sleeve for the next update, and the current implementation is more a proof of concept kind of thing...
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:48:06
Lightning network, if/when adopted should result in a significant reduction in bitcoin chain congestion, so fees should fall as a result. 
The idea behind the lightning network is that the channels will (almost) all be interconnected with time. If you open a channel with Coinbase, let's say, then you can send or receive bitcoin with Coinbase, but also with anyone that also has a channel open with Coinbase, and anyone that has a channel open with those people. So by opening a channel with Coinbase, you will be able to transfer bitcoin to Coinbase, Gemini, Amazon, me, SpaceX, Joe's Sex Toys in Michigan etc etc etc, providing they are on the network. Because you will have a channel open with Coinbase, and so will I, I will also have one open with Joe's Sex Toys - so you don't need to open a new channel with Joe's. You can send a transaction through Coinbase, then through me, to reach Joe's to purchase your sex doll or whatever.
You can chose to never close a channel, but as you can't respend the coins you have exchanged with the merchant for the product, you have lost ownership and control of them them. And as he can move them freely around the lightning network (to pay his supplier, pay his employees, buy himself a beer, or whatever) he has gained ownership and control of them.
When the network is established properly, it should work like this.
You connect to the lightning network by opening a channel, you can then send and receive bitcoin around the network to/from anyone else in the network by routing it through others in the network. If you send 1 bitcoin to someone else in the network - it's gone - you don't have it anymore, you can't send it to anyone else ever, you can't reclaim it, they own it now, and they can do what they wish with it. They can hodl it, they can spend it, they can send half to their grandson over the network and half to their grandmother over the network. Now their grandson and grandmother own it. And they can spend it with a bunch of other merchants for a product on the network. Now they don't own it any more, the merchants do. And they can do what they want with it.
If you intend to only send one bitcoin transaction, ever. Then there would be no real advantage to using the lightning network. Just use the main bitcoin network.
You're never forced to keep a channel open, you can close one whenever you wish. But it wouldn't make sense to keep opening and closing channels, you wouldn't be receiving the benefit of using the lightning network that way.

Like with any scam, it's definitely crappy that some vulnerable (and let's be honest, some just blinded by greed) people got hurt.
But it's definitely an extreme positive that people will be questioning what other parts of crypto are a scam. Nobody should be shoving money at anything without looking into it carefully with a critical eye. Ideally, anybody putting any money that amounts to more than a day's fun money into any crypto would research it to the best of their ability. Anything else will always just be like giant magnet for scams and scammers.
The entirety of cryptocurrency being viewed sceptically and warily is only good for the sphere. Can only lead to fewer successful scams, and less overall volatility.

There were all powered by a company called Wavecrest. Visa recently cancelled their agreement with Wavecrest due to Wavecrest not following the terms and conditions of the agreement (which terms we don't know, only visa and wavecrest know), so Wavecrest can no longer use Visa cards. This effected all visa debit cards issues by Wavecrest, not just the cryptocurrencies related ones. Wavecrest cards that use MasterCard  aren't effected. Visa cryptocurrencies debit cards not issued through Wavecrest aren't effected.
It's just shitty luck that so many of the major crypto debit cards were Wavecrest Visa cards.

Well no, the tldr would be that if you struggle at the most simple part of understanding, maybe it's just beyond your ability to understand for some reason. But that's fine, not everything is for everyone. My partners grandfather never used the smartphone she got him three years ago beyond Christmas day, too fidlly for him, that's fine, he's content with that. I showed my six year old niece how to use a bitcoin wallet in 10 minutes without issue "you click on send, then you put the person's number in here, and then the amount of money here, and this button here sends it to them" (the wallet was Airbitz {I think they call themselves 'Edge' now}, if you're interested in checking out a pretty foolproof, non fiddly wallet). I set my father, who has never owned a personal computer before he was gifted an iPhone two years ago, up with a bitcoin wallet a few months ago, and he hasn't had any issue using it. Different people take to things differently I guess. Bitcoin doesn't seem to be for you, you seem to struggle with the most basic and simple ideas and utilisation. But that's fine, there's no reason you have to try to get to grips with it, not yet anyway. So I wouldn't sweat it. Not everyone needed to 'get' the internet, or automobiles, or smartphones, right away either. Things will be simplified even further with time for those that struggle. So just check back in in a year or so maybe. Best of luck.

I'll start with a personal anecdote, then give you a direction to look into for yourself if you'd like something more than that, I've no interest in trying to convince you with my anonymous words on the internet. But if you're interested in finding out for yourself what the measurable truth of the situation is, this will help.
As bitcoin hit ~$12,000 at the beginning of November, up from $3,000 in September, I was in the company of an acquaintance of mine, as he was making a purchase for something with bitcoin.
"Aren't you worried it will go up to like $24,000 in a month, and you'll regret spending it?"
"Ha, it's bitcoin Quick! Maybe it'll go up to 24, maybe it'll go back to 1000. Sent."
Now if your interested in looking into evidence for which one of us is right about bitcoin being spent even though volatile, and even when experiencing accelerated upwards (it holds true for downwards too btw) price trends. Inhave a couple.of directions I can point you in.
First, Google for the transaction volumes, the number of bitcoin payments, the service Bitpay have recorded, during it's existence. This companies processing of payments are not trading volume on exchanges. It's a service to help merchants accept bitcoin payments from customers. And match these to what the bitcoin price was doing during these differences in thier transaction volumes. What do you find?
Now if you're interested looking a little further. Download Tor, and find a darknet market. It's not illegal to view these sites, so you don't have to worry about just viewing it. And observe the relative frequency of trading that occurs using cryptocurrency. Keep an eye on it intermittently, and if bitcoin (or monero, their price movements track fairly closely) experiences a period of accelerated price growth, tell me what you observe about the amount of trade going on. Then do the same  during a period of accelerated downward price action. 
Let me know what you find out.

I already know where the library is bla bla bla" was a go to for hacky stand up comedians everywhere for a while. You're basically in the same boat they were in. I wouldn't worry about it, you just don't get it, that's fine, no one's going to force you to try and use it. Some people still have never owned a PC or smartphone, or used the internet, it's all good. No one held them down and made them. Bitcoin will leave you alone, you're probably best off just forgetting it even exists.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:45:58
A simplified way to think of it is that the lightning network keeps track of promises to transfer bitcoin that can't be reneged on. 
So you open a lightning channel with the exchange, and then you pay them 100usd for whatever market value 100usd gets you, lets say 0.001 bitcoin. They agree, using the lightning network to an unbreakable promise to send you 0.001 bitcoin.
Because no tx has actually happened, there is no tx fee. 
You can make one of these promises/contracts with them over and over and over again, for months if you like. But no tx's are actually happening, just unbreakable promises, therefore no tx fees. 
You can then make an unbreakable promise with me to send me 0.5 of the bitcoin, but again, no tx is actually happening, just an unbreakable promise, so still no tx fee. 
And I can then make an unbreakable promise to send 0.01 of that bitcoin to the exchange because I decide I'd like to sell that much on there. 
And on and on it goes. Round and round and round, a big series of unbreakable promises, for days or weeks or months. 
Then eventually you decide you don't want to use the lightning network anymore for a while for some reason. So you close your lightning channel. At this point, all the unbreakable promises are added up and the final balance of your channel is calculated.
How much bitcoin you bought from the exchange, minus what you sent me, minus what you spent on overstock.com for that laptop, plus what your friend Bob sent you, minus what you spent on the darknet on coke, minus what you donated to some charity, plus what someone paid you for your car etc etc etc. 
And then one transaction is made to settle your channel, and you have to pay that one tx fee. So you've made 173 transactions on the lightning network, over 9 months, but only have to pay two tx fees. The one to open your channel at the very beginning, and the one to close it at the very end.
 
So you get 173 transactions (really just a big list of 173 unbreakable promises back and forth and back and forth between a bunch of people -you, the exchange, me, Bob, overstock.com, etc) for the price of 2.

'Goxed' is a reference to MtGox, the first big bitcoin exchange, and the first big exchange to get hacked. So he's saying don't leave a lot on the exchange to day trade with, because if it gets hacked, like keeps happening to exchanges, all your day trading coin is gone.

It would be money laundering if you are buying it with previously untaxed income (bank robbery, black market off the books work, etc) with the goal of then converting it back into USD at some point and claiming it is legitimately acquired money.
If you're just buying it with your own legitimately acquired money, which you have paid any due tax on, then it's no different to buying cabbages or Blu-ray disks. So no, it's not close to illegal, or to being money laundering.

Which is a fine analogy, if that's the goal of bitcoin, for transacting in it to be a luxury the richest of people can afford to overpay for without thinking about, because they've more money than they know what to do with anyway, so why not. And the slightly less wealthy can treat themselves to on rare occasions. And everyone else can go fuck themselves, and be sneered at by the restaurants regulars for eating in taco bell. But the idea is meant to be an alternative to the fiat ecosystem. Something anyone and everyone can use, that's faster and cheaper, with much less barrier to entry.
It's meant to be grain, not caviar.
And yes, the tech is in development. And yes, the hope is, like the internet, the tech can keep expanding capacity to capable levels to accommodate the demand, as the previous capacity chokes up. But an attitude of, "this is a superior luxury product, which one shall be willing to pay a premium for, if one should wish to partake" is fucking awful.

I don't think anyone can deny that Satoshi Nakamoto had a pretty strong resolve as far as remaining anonymous goes. I also don't think anyone can deny that Hal was one of the smarter and more creative humans around. If you were a very smart, very creative human, would sending a few emails to yourself to strengthen plausible deniability in future be out of the question?

A public blockchain means entry is completely open and unrestricted. Anyone can participate, anyone can start mining, anyone can run a node, no one needs to ask permission, and no one gets to give permission. A public blockchain is open, everyone or anyone can enter or exit at will, each person is the only person that gets to say for themselves whether they will participate or not. No one can prevent new participants joining. No one can force participants to leave.
This compares to a private blockchain, where participation is in effect invite only. Where the owners of the chain control who can participate, by issuing invites to new participants, and/or creating rules that dictate who can participate. They can add, change, or update rules as they see fit.
Public blockchains are public land, where anyone can come and go as they please, equally and without permission.
Private blockchains are private land, where the owner decides who can come and go.

Yeah the fee is in bitcoin, and the miners chose which ones to process first, and they chose the ones with the highest fee to process first, and work their way down through them. So if you want the transaction to go through right away, you pay the higher fee, as that will get picked up first. If you're not in so much of a rush, you can chose a lower one, and it will be processed after all the higher ones are.

Hi Sam, really enjoyed your article. Could I ask a question? You mentioned that spamming the network would cost millions of dollars - But if the person(s) that was spamming the network was acting in conjunction with a large mining pool, or was in charge of one, would the cost not be zero, as they could just process their own spam and therefore be collecting back their own fees? If that's possible would it not mean that they could spam up to any amount they wished, indefinitely, despite things like segwit and schnorr signatures?

No, there's no maximum, people can keep outbidding each other forever, that's why the fees are getting so high. There's no ceiling. But they're also so high because the network is so congested. If the congestion falls, fees will fall too, as there will be less pressure on people to have to outbid each other to make sure their transaction goes through in a timely fashion (or at all). 
You can use this link 
 
to check the current fees. The bars are color coded to match the fees on the left. If the bar is getting fatter, that means the number of unconfirmed transactions at that fee level is increasing. The bars at the top that are zigzagging are the ones that are getting cleared the fastest.
So at the minute, nothing under 300sat/byte are getting procesed. You can see that all the bars from 250-300 and under are getting fatter (or remaining even). So 300-350 is the minimum fee atm.

Say you sell t-shirts, and your most popular one costs 10 dollars. I like the t-shirt, but I think the value of my dollar will double by next week. So I'd be willing to offer 5 dollars for the t-shirt, as I think that's a fair price. You think the price of a dollar will only go up by 50%, so you would be happy to sell it to me for $7.50.
And this goes on with every other person that thinks they might like to buy one of the t-shirts too. They weigh up what they think would be a good enough deal on the t-shirt. Maybe they think the value of the dollar will be dead level in a week, so anything it's on offer for, under $10 dollars, looks like a bargain to them. The $7.50 price tag, to them, would represent a saving of 25% on the 'real value' of the t-shirt.
And round and round it goes, there is a certain price, at which enough people will view the price the t-shirt is on offer for, as a good deal for them, and will purchase it. 
So for instance, you may feel bitcoin is presently over valued, and will fall by 10% over the next month. I may feel it is undervalued, and will rise by 10%. So if I was to have a car for sale, the bluebook value of it is 10,000usd, I would probably be happy to sell it to you for the bitcoin equivalent of 9,500usd, as I feel that bitcoin will soon go up 10%, and be worth 10,450. So I'm making a good sale, and am potentially ending up 450 better off once the bitcoin value rises.
You would also be happy to buy it for 9,500usd equivalent of bitcoin, because you feel that amount of coin will drop 10% and only be worth 8550 in a month, so in your mind you are also making a good deal, as you are getting the car for 500 less than its bluebook value, and are parting with your bitcoin at a valuation of them which is 10% more than you think next month's value will be.
We both walk away from the deal satisfied.
Then everyone everywhere does that over and over and over again with everything, and ultimately, by consensus, the market decides one of your t-shirts is worth 0.0037btc and one of my cars are worth 0.35btc, and they become the 'going' rates for those items on bitcoin.
Some people will always think that's too much bitcoin for the t-shirt, because they feel the value will always rise too much to make spending that on a t-shirt justifiable. Some people will always think it's a great price in bitcoin for the t-shirt, because they think bitcoin is falling or stating level or just that it's a very cheap price regardless for such a nice t-shirt.
And now you have a t-shirt that enough people are willing to part with 0.0037btc for in order to make selling t-shirts for bitcoin a profitable endeavour for you. If not enough people will pay 0.0037, you may need to sell it for 0.0032. If people go mad looking to buy them for 0.0037, maybe you can bump the price up to 0.004 bitcoin.
Either way, the market should find the value at which people will part with X amount of their coin in exchange for your t-shirt. Even the most optimistic bitcoin bull would probably have no problem parting with 0.001 bitcoin right this second for a new house. It's just a matter of the market finding the balance, and the current value of things in bitcoin being worked out by consensus. This value is dynamic, and can move up and down depending on demand for the item at that value, but this is how things currently work anyway. An iPhone X is only worth 1100, if that's what people will pay. If no-one pays that price it will be sold cheaper. If you wait untill three months after it launches, you will probably get one at a cheaper price. It's up to everyone to decide if they would rather wait 3 months, and buy it for 100 dollars less, or if that 100 dollars is reasonable value for having the phone right when it launches instead.

For the longest time there has been a taken for granted "just fucking try it, we'll start dusting off the guillotines " kind of hostility towards moving in the direction of a cashless society.
In 1984 the idea of the government installing cameras and microphones in people's homes is out out there, and no one worries too much because if they actually tried to do that we'd start dusting off the guillotines. But today most people have a camera and microphone with them at all times that the government can click on and off whenever they choose. People pay lots of money to have the privilege of carrying them with them at all times. 
Bitcoin could be the government's way of having people literally bidding over the right to enter a cashless, 100% tracked and recorded society, and no one would bat an eyelid, because it's "our idea", and "our thing to use against them".
That's the motivation. That's the angle.

The transaction size is a result of the number of inputs and outputs. An output is created any time some bitcoin is received by a wallet, a record saying "this amount of bitcoin was outputted from some other wallet, to get to this wallet". So a brand new wallet, that receives a single amount of bitcoin, will have one output. If that wallet receives ten seperate deposits of bitcoin (say for example, you make 10 purchases of 0.01 bitcoin on an exchange, and transfer to your personal Ledger wallet after each purchase), then that 0.1 bitcoin (ten seperate deposits of 0.01) in your ledger wallet, will now have ten outputs attached to it. A record of how that 0.1 bitcoin balance was constructed, all the different pieces that make up the whole 0.1 balance. 
So now when you want to send some of that bitcoin to another wallet, like OP wishing to send some to his nephew in this case, the amount of bitcoin will be made up of the various pieces of bitcoin previously received - previous outputs.
So as OP previously had 11 deposits in his wallet that equaled the amount he wished to send to his nephew, meaning 11 outputs taken into the wallet from somewhere else, a transfer of all that bitcoin to another wallet will have 11 outputs attached to the transaction that need to be sent with it, meaning it is a larger total transaction, than if had only needed four previous deposits to make up the amount to send, or one previous deposit, that equalled the amount he wished to send.
If the wallet that previously received the ten 0.01 bitcoin deposits, wishes to send a 0.03 transaction to another wallet, there will be 3 outputs - three of the previous 0.01 deposits (outputs) will be used. To send 0.08 bitcoin, 8 of the previous 0.01 deposits will be used - therefore 8 outputs, meaning a larger transaction.
If that wallet balance of 0.1 bitcoin, had of received that 0.1 bitcoin in one 0.08 bitcoin deposit, and two hundred 0.001 deposits - then they could make a 0.08 transfer to someone that would only require one output - the one 0.08 deposit they previously received. But if that wallet wished to make a transfer of it's total balance of 0.1 bitcoin - it would need to use all previous 201 outputs that make up it's total balance - and would be a massive transaction.

Similarly I'm a huge bitcoin fan, and having a little stake in it makes its successes that little bit more exciting and personal. 
Bitcoin is tremendous fun. It's magic internet money, created by a shadowy anonymous cypherpunk, that's pitted the forces of decentralisation head first against the long established societal systems of control and coercion. It's a crack in the sandbox and it's leaking raw goey freedom. It only experiences dizzying highs and terrifying lows, it's a state of the art fighter jet with a piss ass drunk coked up to the eyeballs pilot, but really fucking awesome in built autopilot AI. It is constantly under attack, but is like the Borg guys out of that tv show where you only get one or two shots in before they stop having effect and then it keeps coming stronger than ever.

People spend bitcoin all the time. They spend it on fiat mostly, because the infrastructure isn't in place to spend it where they can spend the fiat yet. They spend it on the thriving darknet markets, because fiat isn't used there. They spend it on altcoins, because it's often better suited to that purpose than fiat is. 
Some people do hold onto every bit they can, and never spend any, in the same way some people never cash in thier stock dividends and just allow the compound interest to build and build. But plenty others spend their dividends, or sell their stock when it reaches a certain amount they are happy with.
The darkmarkets and the altcoin markets are pretty good examples here. Both markets are constantly growing, are thriving and are very liquid, lots and lots of bitcoin being spent rather than simply hodled. Anywhere it is easier or more suitable to spend bitcoin than fiat, people are spending a lot of bitcoin. And the number of places and instances where it is easier or more suitable to spend bitcoin than fiat will continue to grow and grow.
Some people will always hodl everything they can, the way some people will never liquify their stock dividends. Others will spend some and hodl the rest. And others will spend freely and then replace what they spent so they can spend freely again.
I see no liquidity issues with bitcoin. It's available to buy near instantly. Wherever it is the more suitable form of currency for a purchase to be made in, it is spent very freely. 
But people worry that as bitcoin becomes more and more the better choice for making a purchase, in more situations, people will be less likely to use it to make purchases? The rate of new bitcoins being added to the system has fallen constantly since its creation. The price of bitcoin has continued to rise since its creation. The number of daily transactions has increased constantly since its creation.
When are we expected to see this economic stagnation in the system caused by the price rising and everyone ceasing to transact? Why haven't we seen it yet?

Every single person that bought when it hit an ATH of 1200, providing they didn't sell or lose their coin, did the right thing. Same is true of everyone that bought the ath at 2000, and 4976, and 8000.
To date, the only wrong move when bitcoin has hit a new ATH, is not buying in, or selling. 
Maybe 12000 is different to 37 or 1200, or 1250, or 4600. Maybe it's the high water mark and this is the absolute peak of bitcoin adoption, and the numbers only go down from here, but I really don't see what anyone anywhere could possibly be basing that on? You certainly can't conclude it from past events. You can't conclude it from the health of the bitcoin ecosystem - it's improving and evolving at an absolutely insane pace. 
What's that fear based on exactly?
The way I see it, it can only be based on the belief that the current market cap is the absolute high limit at the entirely arbitrary figure of 212 billion. Or that bitcoin's utility is decreasing, which flies in the face of the fact that their is a whole series of second and third layer technologies about to come onstream which will massively increase or add to it's utility. 
Bitcoin is high risk for people that have missed the whole point, and are hoping to hop in and out quickly as a way of making fast, easy, fiat currency.
For anyone else there looks to be little to fear.

There aren't any unbiased subreddits that welcome criticism and lack angry mobs waiting to crucify, but that's not a bitcoin or cryptocurrencies thing. Reddit's format breeds echo chambers by default. You can find a subreddits where the angry mob will descend on you if you say Liberals/computer games/ religion/ communism/ technology/ cheese/ feminism/ anime are awful, and subreddits where the angry mob will descend on you if you say they are great, but none where there is a permeating "unbiased average user voice of reason". It's the innevitability of a system where every opinion expressed is weighted on popularity based on the current opinion of the majority. The majority continuosly grows, the consensus becomes more rigid, and room for going against the consensus diminishes as criticisms of the consensus are hidden from view through downvoting, and views which support the consensus are rpomoted and made more visible through upvoting.
Some subs are worse than others, generally related to the initial tone of the sub and the age of it. There's no point at which you could openly criticize feminism in r/feminism without drawing down the angry mob. There may have been a time when you could openly criticize Breaking Bad in r/Breakingbad, but not after the consensus reached a certain level.
If you find a sub where the majority is still being established and solid consensus hasn't hardened yet, you can find less angry mob to attack your criticism (or at least, there will be enough flux of opinion sonthat response to the criticism will find more balance). But how unbiased your criticism is will play a part there too. "Computer games are all crap and they make children violent and you're all idiots for playing them, because I say so" will never receive a perfectly balanced, even response in a sub dedicated to computer games. Biased, unsupported, trolly posts draw biased, unsupported trolly responses.
r/bitcoindiscussion is a newer sub for discussion of bitcoin that seems to be starting with the specific goal of trying to be balanced and avoiding "biased angry mob" type responses. So if you have a non-biased criticism to make of bitcoin, maybe try there, while it's still young, the majority is forming and consensus is still hardening.
Reddit is a great platform for finding like minded people that love or hate the same thing as you and wish to indulge in a love up or hatefest based around that thing, but it's format is inherently hostile to unbiased balanced discussion.

No one should be paying anything close to $50, or $20 for that matter. The congestion is clearing, 50sat/byte fees (about $2.50 total) will go through if you're prepared to wait a couple days for them to confirm.
So u/RoyWNL when sending your bitcoin from the blockchain.info wallet, chose 'advanced send', and you will be able to set a custom fee. A fee of $5 (120sat/byte) should go through in about 24 hours, which should be fine for your purposes.

Perhaps, with Rootstock or some other smart contract tech coming on stream, everyone will have a dead man's switch linked to their bitcoin? If you don't sign off once every 3 months, or once a year, or whatever, the bitcoin will automatically transfer to some other specified wallet(s). Seems to be in the spirit of decentralisation and trustlessnes that we remove the middlemen, (governments and law firms in this case) in relation to what happens our bitcoin after our deaths, as well as during our lifetimes.

Anyone know what the lowest transaction fee is that won't remain unconfirmed right now? Had a 790sat/byte go through in 85 mins. Just sent out a 250sat/byte to test how that will do, will update with result.
How are other people fairing?
How low does a fee have to be for a transaction to get dumped back?
Maybe a thread on this would make a good sticky for the sub? People can post their custom fees and we can keep track of the floor so people aren't paying over the odds to be sure their tx's get confirmed.

Banking in some form or another has existed for over 4000 years. In its most basic form, banking is just someone with more of something than you, lending you some of it, on the promise that you will give them back something of equal or greater value at a certain point in the future. They can accumulate more of it than you by any means necessary, digging it up, growing it, trading for it, or offering to store it safely for others and then lending that. Cryptocurrencies may, possibly, way way in the future, remove the last option in terms of the bank aquiring enough to lend in the first place. But there will always be someone with less of something, willing to borrow some of that thing from someone with more of it, on the promise of returning more than they borrowed, in the future.
Call the lender "banks", or "cryptoloaners", or "smazgoblergoos", whatever you want, they'll always exist, because there will always be demand for them to exist.

You should be all good then. Your words are the main thing. As long as you have them (or have access to them) you have access to your bitcoin.
You can think of the words as a mould that can be used to cast a key that unlocks access to your bitcoin. As long as you have the mould, you can always cast a new key (or many identical keys) to access your bitcoin with. Any ledger (or any other wallet) can be cast into the shape of your unique key using the words/mould.
This is why it's so important to keep your words safe and secure. If anyone gets access to your mould/words, they can cast their own key to access your bitcoin. But as long as you have your words/mould, you'll always be able to cast yourself a new key if you lose or break your current one.

This'll probably get lost in all the completely deserved attention - and I know you said you don't want to start a charity - but just throwing this out there.
How about buying a fuck load of bitcoin mining rigs and donating them to poor villages with little opportunity for economic development. I've been through places in Cambodia and several other places where people are fully prepared to work 18/20 hour days if given the chance, but the chances are few and far between. These places do tend to have electricity and internet access, really really cheap electricity, comparitively.
Whole villages could pull themselves up out of multi-generational poverty and become comparitively wealthy "bitcoin mining villages". This also benefits bitcoin by helping to increase minor decentralisation, and spread very very positive bitcoin news around the world to help balance out the FUD.
"Tonight, on Famous Current Affairs Show, we cover how a tiny village in Cambodia is building their first local hospital, funded completely by the villagers themselves. They're booming after striking... Bitcoin? Tune in at ten!"

The white paper for the lightning network was released in January 2016, outlining the idea for the lightning network.  A bit after this people asked when it was likely it could be up and running - one of the devs estimated it would be about 18 months. When it didn't deploy fully operationally in June/July of this year, exactly 18 months after the release of the white paper, certain people started pissing wildly in their knickers and screeching that it was vapourware, and would never happen, and therefore everyone should immediately hardfork to a chain with a bigger blocksize i.e bcash. It's all very silly.

No. A forked coin is worth whatever someone else will pay for it when you try to sell it. It's price is not really linked to the price of the coin it forked from in any way. So, starting price depends on pre-fork marketing, name recognition (why you get so many coins called 'bitcoin xyz') a bit on the actual tech underlying the coin and what problem it claims to solve, things like that. So you'll have one 'Bitcoin Titanium' or whatever, for each Bitcoin you have, but that will be worth whatever someone else will pay for it, could be 10,000usd or could be 0.01usd. Market decides.

I just mean, that at present, when people want to purchase something with the bitcoin they hold, they mostly cash it out for fiat, and then spend the fiat, more or less spending bitcoin on fiat currency. You see lots of posts in here from time to time, with people saying they took some profits (sold some of their bitcoin for fiat {USD, CAD, Euro, etc}) to purchase a laptop, or iPhone, or a puppy, to pay rent  or pay some debt off, or whatever. This is spending their bitcoin, but it makes more sense to go bitcoin 
-&gt;fiat -&gt; puppy right now, as there aren't many options to buy puppies directly for bitcoin. If the option was there to buy the laptop or puppy, or pay off the student loan/credit card debt, directly with bitcoin, I'm sure most would have done so, for obvious reasons. For the sake of this discussion it amounts to the same thing, people choosing to their give bitcoin to someone else, rather than hodl it, so they can receive some item or service equal to its current value (despite the possibility of that value being greater in the future if they just held onto it.)

You have no use for bitcoin, that's fine. I never owned a checkbook, no use to me. My partner never had a credit card, still doesn't.
Bitcoin's promise is to allow one to store wealth in an unconfiscateable, secure manner, and transfer or receive wealth freely, without permission, anywhere in the world. It can provide an immediate exit of wealth, sometimes the only exit, from a more precarious system of storage that is the only other option available.
For you this is all meaningless. You're fortunate enough to be in a position where your wealth and the access to it is relatively secure and stable, for the foreseeable present. This means you are in a fortunate minority on earth. 
But it has the possibility of being life changing and potentially life saving for others not as fortunate as you.
Then there are people in between, with less serious but still desirable use cases.
My partner will probably never own a credit card at this stage. And you'll probably never own a bitcoin wallet. It's all good, hopefully you'll never be in a position to regret not having one. Best wishes.

Isn't the idea that due to the whole 6 degrees of separation thing, once LN is up to speed, you will only be opening a channel and closing one very rarely?

If you have your words safe, you can access the wallet using the words any time you want, yes. So you can take a new ledger, and use the words to make it into a clone of the old Ledger. The wallet will have the same balance, the same transaction history, etc. It will be identical.
Your coins aren't actually downloaded to the ledger. The ledger just keeps your private key, the thing that allows you to access your wallet, or move coins to another one, safe and secure.
Your wallet address and your coins only exist on the blockchain. Your Ledger (or another hardware wallet), or a software wallet, like Samouri, or Electrum etc, just holds the private key that allows you to move those coins to a different address, if you wish.

Ah I see. I suppose the advantage of a transparent blockchain vs an opaque one, say bitcoin vs monero, would be the transparency it's self.
For example, a big problem for charities more recently is the loss of trust they've experienced through lack of transparency ("I'm not giving them a donation, how do I know it's going to help people and not paying for some CEO's coke and hookers?"). A charity that operates on a transparent blockchain is truly transparent. No one has to trust that the money coming in is what they say it is, or that the money they spend is going where they claim it is. 
Plenty of businesses could also benefit from this level of transparency. No need to worry about employees skimming off the top, or embezzling when everything in and out is entirely transparent, and unalterable. All money in is lodged to one wallet, or collection of wallets, and all money out can be traced quickly, cheaply and easily by reviewing the transactions out of those wallets. Cooking the books becomes unfeasible.
Anywhere that transparency is a benefit, or is required, transparent blockchains are the best existing solution to the issues that can arise. They remove the need for trust. Anyone can confirm for themselves that the money flows as another party claims.

My bank just sent me a letter informing me they are more than tripping the quarterly fee they will be charging me for the maintenance of an account I don't use.
Two years ago I had to move abroad for a year for work. It cost in total between banking fees and bank exchange rate etc 800 to transfer 5000 over from one bank in one currency to another into another currency. It took 4 days for a transfer to complete.
Had I been using bitcoin then I would have had zero fees up to that point charged by a bank for the pleasure of letting them hold my money and do whatever they want with it on the promise they give it back to me if I come asking. And I could have used localbitcoin to exchange my bitcoin for the local currency, within a few hours, and been up a couple of hundred on my initial amount of fiat, instead of down 500. I'd have happily paid a 5 dollar tx fee.
And this is without the existence of lightning or any future technologies. It's still very very early days for bitcoin tech wise. I bet lots of people complained that the only 'value' of the internet was its ability transfer data quickly and cheaply over distance. Yep, that's it's value. Gunpowder's value was going *bang!*. And the only value of glass when it was first blown was you can see through it.
That's a couple of examples of the value my bitcoin is storing.

A satoshi is just a name people decided to call 0.00000001 bitcoins. There's also millisatoshi as a name to describe 0.00000000001 bitcoin. So if a satoshi was worth 1000, an msat would be worth one USD. 
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Its one of the really cool things about it. If one satoshi is worth 1000 and you need to transfer something equivalent to one cent, you just transfer 0.0000000000001 bitcoin - 1/100th of a millisatoshi. It doesn't have a common use name right now - I nominate 'jigglycunt' - and you're done. Need to transfer something a thousand times smaller than that? Just add three more zeroes after the decimal place - boom - mission accomplished.

From what I can tell it seems like someone hired a dev or company to make the app, then had this girl claim she did it single handed. As it's good marketing.
I doubt the girl herself came up with the idea and hired the contractor(s) herself. She's a 16 year old girl, she doesn't have the wherewithal or funds to do it herself (hiring the contractor, or coding the app). She's trying to look pretty for boys in her class, worrying about what the bitch Jessie said to Brittany about Cloe who likes Brian even though he so likes Ciara, and sitting in her room listening to 21 pilots or whoever. 
That's my take anyway. Just a marketing thing, probably little to do with the girl herself other than her being an aspect of the marketing. So people should probably ease off a little on the blame for her. She's a 16 year old girl, she's not fully cooked yet. Can't really expect her to take some grand moral "I shall not let my name be used in such a way" stance when asked if she'd like to make a cut of some money for doing not very much.

That's not what legal tender means? It usually means you are not compelled to accept anything as payment of a debt unless it's the legal tender. But you can still sell someone a cabbage for a packet of skittles despite skittles not being legal tender. Checks aren't considered legal tender, but you can still pay for things by check, or accept checks as payment for something. I can still trade you a bag of cats for an iPhone you're selling, despite cat bags not being legal tender.
Bitcoin not being legal tender doesn't mean you can't pay for goods or services with bitcoin, or accept payment in bitcoin for goods or services, it just means people can refuse to accept it as payment for a debt, but it's up to the creditor, in that case, they can if they wish to.

Where was the bottom though, where you bought? So like you've worked out that bitcoin isn't going to go any lower than it is now based on your backtesting and stuff, as you've already bought, or you would have waited until then? And now it's going to go back up? And then that will be the highest ever, at least for now, where you'll sell, otherwise you would wait til it went higher than that? So you bought about $9,300 or something? That's the bottom you figured out? And then the top is? You'll sell at that? And you'll make money cause all the other guys doing the same thing guessed a lower low and a higher high?
