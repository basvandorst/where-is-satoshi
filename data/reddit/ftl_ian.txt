Keene, NH has more bitcoin-accepting businesses per capita than anywhere else in NH and maybe even the world.

Did you see the amended version of the bill that actually passed?  
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:11:59
There are multiple new senators (NH elects all reps, senators, and governor every two years) this time, so we don't really know what's going to happen, but some of the worst prohibitionists from the last senate term are gone this time, so there is hope.

Don't know if you've noticed, but that's pretty much what we have, minus the rotting corpses. Maybe you should move here now.

Cantwell has become a racist nationalist.  He has abandoned principle and embraced the state.  Sad.  We still hang out from time to time.  I have hope that maybe someday he'll see the light again.  But right now, he's pretty awful - the worst version of Cantwell yet.

Two people asked me about the shirt - I consider that a success.

After re-proving my account ownership, itbit has allowed me back into the account, but I have yet to receive any information about their investigation.

Hey, everyone who got hacked - just curious - what was the withdrawal address that the attacker used?  The one they used on me was: 1GgMFrDafux9eJz3LFHfvyQLaiaD3Wti98

I reported an unauthorized withdrawal last night on the account I administer at itbit.  The attacker canceled a pending withdrawal about fifteen minutes after I ordered the withdrawal then a few seconds later the attacker ordered a withdrawal of the same amount of BTC to an unauthorized wallet ID.  
Strange thing is, my itbit account was supposedly restricted to only allowing withdrawals to ONE wallet ID, so how the attacker was able to bypass that, I'm not yet sure.
The attack happened about 4:16pm Eastern on Jul 9th.
I informed itbit a few hours later and my account is now frozen as they investigate.
I suspect these two instances could be related.
Perhaps it was an attack by someone locally on my computer, but it could have been a hack on itbit or an inside job at itbit by a disgruntled employee?  No word back yet on the investigation. 
The one thing that was different here is that the attacker did not place an order on my account, like they did on the OP.

It appears they may have used it on someone else - looks like about 4 BTC was sent to that address on 7/18.

Talked with itBit support today - they say that the unauthorized commands came from my IP, which means a local security issue or some malware.  Given that other people have had similar experience, it seems more likely it is malware, but the computer scans clean.
itBit has not concluded anything regarding the multiple reports.
