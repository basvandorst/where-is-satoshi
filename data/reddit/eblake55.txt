A few things to think about, are you going to need to sell them?
If Bitcoin goes mainstream you will be able to use them to purchase almost anything you need.
In the interim, people will wait for interim highs and sell into heavy buying volume in a process called distribution. 
If you had coins in cold storage and wanted to sell you would need to preempt where you think the top of the market is and then pull them out of cold storage in order to sell.
There would be temporary risk of holding large amounts of capital on exchanges that you would need to take into account.

I phoned the FSCS last year as well to ask them how much collateral they have in the event of a systemic banking collapse. They said £28 billon. (FYI) total deposits are around a trillion. So I asked what happens in the event of a systemic bank collapse and basically they said the BOE will just print the money needed. 
So it goes back to the famous Greenspan quote they can gurantee deposits but thy can't gurantee the purchasing power of the currency :)

I phoned the FSCS financial services compensation scheme the other day into there insurance on UK deposits.
They only have £28 billion to ensure all deposits in the UK.
I asked what happens if there is a systemic banking failure and they replied they go to the BOE that just prints the money to cover it.
So essentially they can cover all deposits but they cannot on any way gurantee the purchasing power of those deposits after debasement to cover deposits.
All these schemes are pointless.

Thanks for the feedback everyone, I am going to get legal assistance before making any decision of this nature, (i dont rely just on reddit) but its good to get feedback from the community. 
Thanks again

Great idea I recently wrote this article which lists a lot of benefits that you might find helpful. It's a work in progress I need to add in no chargebacks 
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:15:05
 - I agree with a lot of what you say, in the UK there are also many accounts with additional fees, charges, etc the amount of comparisons you can draw is almost endless. 
The goal of the article was to benchmark against the current cheapest way of sending transactions because if bitcoin can compete against that, then the other more expensive accounts will be a no competition With regards to the fees, lets not forget that these can potentially drop massively going forward with continued growth of the network, and even if you do pay a small fee currently there are still benefits with regards to availability and speed and the two biggest, counterparty risk and debasement. Bitcoin is still early days and the recommended fees (which are voluntary) can drop further

 - I agree, the move to mBC will help people understand they dont have to purchase a whole bitcoin at a time.

I wrote about this possibly happening in my article from July
"In addition to this, recent US sanctions against Russia as well as perceived overreach by a prominent US bank, could have  been taken by authorities as another warning that Russia may need a more diverse set of tools to facilitate international trade in the future. This will only be compounded as the existing global financial system becomes more unstable and trust between major powers (especially the US) continues to deteriorate"

It makes me laugh, all these financial institutions desperately wanted to remove all cash from the system, so they could centralise and skim fee's from all electronic transactions. 
Unfortunately for them Bitcoin beat them to it, now they are crying like girls.

In relation to the % return of holding the currency the inflation rate of bitcoin is still extremely low on a relative basis. 
The opposite is true with fiat currency that has no interest and inflation rates that destroy purchasing power.

Check out my article, I state every point why trying to use the Blockchain without the token incentive literally removes every main point of having a decentralised blockchain system:

The Cyprus Bail-in was one of the biggest catalysts for the rise in Bitcoin in March 2013, it took the price from around $40 to $266 and put Bitcoin into the media cycle.
All of these actions are cumulative as well, just because you dont see an instant move in the market, a lot of these events can build up to an eventual move in the same way the snow builds up to a point where it only takes one more snow flake to cause the avalanche

This is a landmark and pretty significant if you know just how big secondary market funds are with retail investors.
The vast majority of retail investment goes through OEIC's, CEIC's ETF's and investment trusts.
