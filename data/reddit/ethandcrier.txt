Youtube is a great resource for *bitcoin learning* materials.

From my experience most of the problems and friction w/coinbase comes from the customer having to integrate bank accounts and credit cards---which bitwage does not deal with. So yes...with respect to dealing with scaling up for bitwage to 1-million customers Bitwage will most likely have an easier time and users a better customer experience IMHO--but that's just my HO.

Might I suggest Bitwage...been using them since Jan 2014, works like clock work...Bitcoin Payroll i.e. acquire btc via direct deposit. Also, customer service is good.

You might want to call up Forbes and tell them they got their article all wrong. Oh...by the way...here is the title of the article: "Fighting Financial Exclusion: How To Serve 88 Million Americans Who Have No Bank". &lt; LOL check your facts dude...

Why is it a binary choice between "store of value" and "token"? Can't it be both and more? (i.e. internet of money, "Andreas A.")

Bank of Englannd (BOE) report says that bitcoin is "harder than gold". What do you think of this article: 
Here is the original report they quoted at the BOE: 
Would you care to change your opinion? If "no"--- why not? Thank u for your response.

Blockchain size narrative i.e. Bitcoin vs BitcoinXT is driving price of btc down.

Bitwage does btc &gt; btc, and maybe accepts credit cards also I believe....not sure though...perhaps you can to talk to them and tell us?

Bitwage is free while in beta.
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:14:09
You can simply just use the bitwage bank info as yours--unless you mention bitwage to your employer your company will not even know. Works like a charm.

Hiver...are you a BW user? I understan  your quote^ . Are you stiill an active user? If so....why do you still use them? Also....I found this following on the BW support page: 
The Bitwage exchange rate is available at the top right of the Bitwage website.
From a cost/exchange rate perspective, we like to think of this from a Total Cost of Services standpoint:
When sending funds to an exchange, you typically have to send an international wire fee, which costs $45 on average and can take 3-5 business days. Some local exchanges allow you to use the ACH system, which takes 2-4 business and locks in the price before the funds get there (this has tax implications explained below). Some systems enable instant buys, but the limits on these features are prohibiting for paying a group of employees. Our system hooks into the back of any payroll system, costs nothing for the sending of the funds, enables next day payments and has no limits to the size of the payroll (permitting that it is actually a payroll payment).
Our exchange rate is not always the best, although we are working on lowering it by partnering with a variety of bitcoin exchanges in the United States and around the world to buy the bitcoins. The result of this rate has to do with various costs we receive in order to manage next day payouts without limits. However, when you compare the fees of other exchanges and the cost of sending funds vs our exchange rate and convenience (ease of use, next day and limitless), the total costs of services are lower.

and Bitwage of course...
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:34:09
really? Wow...that's sounds great. I guess my impression of odesk is mistaken perhaps b/c I thought if one signed up on odesk, one had to use their internal payroll system for paying freelancers? Can you please clarify...this would be great information to share with us:) THank you!

The customer service at Bitwage is tops, and very helpful, so I am confident I can always reach them if I need to sort out any issues, of which there have not been any. Bitwage works like clockwork = confidence + trust.
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:54:02
Sounds like it's a bank problem, not a Bitwage issue to me. My employer is a small biz as well...no issues with Bitwage. Works like clock work.

ummm...so your friend wants to mummify his fiat? That is a great question.

Exciting stuff here...as a freelancer myself travelling for work in different locales every few months this is will be helpful. It feels good not to be at the mercy of all the banking fees when my employers send me my pay. Question to Bitwage and Xapo: if I use this as a rail to receive the fees for work I'v done for my clients, and I'm outside of the US, how much can I expect to save? Do you guys have any numbers on this...especially to the Asia-Pacific?

I can tell you first hand the sign-up process at Bitwage is pretty straigtforwardd. If I remember correctly, just to sign-up initiallly took  a few minutes. They did not ask me to submit any ID either. Sounds like this Dev guy is getting dinged for being in Romania? Fair enough I guesss...but if this guy is looking for "painless"...Bitwagge is as painless as it's gonna get.

Bitwage has both employer (corporate bitcoin payroll i.e. direct deposit) and individual (employee, freelancer/contractor) options.
