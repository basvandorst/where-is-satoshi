You seem to have not even skimmed the link I provided, which clearly articulates a biological basis for transgenders beyond mere "behavior patterns and interests". I'm sorry that I can't do anything more for you over the internet bro, but I tried. I hope that one day you'll be more skeptical and less entrenched.

Okay, so next time maybe try not to be disingenuous in saying it's about every behavior and biological factor lining up, and just say it's only about the genetics for you. Hell, even your last bit is a jab, as I'm already blue in the face telling you that there are distinct neurological differences between a male and a transgender born male, yet you refuse to admit that could ever be the case.

If you click the footnotes or scroll to the bottom of wikipedia articles, it provides you with links to the sources, which in this case links to scientific journals, which I'm under the impression would be the be all and end all of a discussion about biology; I'm sorry for not making that more clear. Not even gonna bother with the rest.

Jeez, did someone shit in your corn flakes this morning? I try to link to scientific studies (and not even sociological ones, but real science) and get told I'm pandering bullshit; fuck you too then buddy and welcome to ignore.

So, if they didn't resemble a boy in *every* way biologically, you'd recant your statement? [Welcome to late 20th century neuroscience]( This must be exciting for you to learn something new about transgenders.
