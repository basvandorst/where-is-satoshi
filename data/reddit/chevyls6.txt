Quick question (coins currently on Binance): when going to Fiat (usd) what's cheapest method?  Send to gdax and withdraw there?  Transfer to usdt then send to tether.to and withdraw there? Or??

Question about btc/usdt.  Eg, assuming btc is $15k and looks like it's gonna a drop, so i go btc--&gt;usdt and btc falls to $10k, will I then be able to go usdt--&gt;btc and effectively by 1.5 btc (since I have $15k usdt)?  Or does usdt fall with the price of btc, and not tied to usd?

Is there a way to do offline wallet (usb stick) for free?  If so, is it frowned upon (not very secure)?

Can you go btc--&gt;ltc via gdax?  If so, how?  Is there a better alternative?

Ya, I remember seeing a literal orange/green moving chart with sells on left buys on right but I can't find it.  I thought it was gdax but I can't find it now, lol.

I've been reading for better part of a week, trying to gain direction; if you were starting out today, which wallet/exchange/etc would use?  (I see Exodus and Gemini both mentioned a lot)  I think I'd like to eventually move to a hard wallet but for now a downloadable one will have to work.
[Side story: I had $5k set back from extra work and was  a day or two away from buying BTC back in March/April but the 80 acres next door popped up for sale and I had to move on that and put my BTC dreams on hold.  Oh what might have been...!]
