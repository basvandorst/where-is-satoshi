Unlike most exchanges VoS will allow you to trade any currency pair. You will *not* have to trade to btc or ltc first. You could do VTC/Doge if you wanted to - this is one of the reasons the features are taking a bit longer to roll out! Lots to work on!

It's important to note that at Vault of Satoshi we will **never** freeze your assets unless we are required to due to a full fledged criminal investigation, government mandate or court order.
Our policy is that we will restrict deposits and trading, we may as you for more info about your identity before re-instating those, but you can **ALWAYS** get your money out. After all it is your money! Some other exchanges do this practice of letting you deposit and freezing assets after that - we don't think it's right. Unless a government authority says we **have to** freeze the funds then you are free to withdraw at all times.
We will practice every required measure of due diligence to ensure users are from South Carolina when trading on our exchange, and may on occasion request more information from a user, if they fail to comply we can shut down their trading account but we will never seize or hold assets. Part of our mantra is about trust and transparency, and that would simply go against everything we believe in!

Does work with TD as long as you don't have the new Visa Debit cards those are a separate network. You'd have to go to a branch and get one of the old debit cards either for your savings account, or a business account debit in order to make a deposit.
The only limits on Interac is what ever your bank has set as your accounts limit for point of sale interac deposits. As well as what ever your Vault of Satoshi verification limit has in place.
Other than that there are no restrictions.

Actually this is a common misconception.
CEX.io charges a monthly maintenance fee per GH on top of the sale price.
So while 10GH/s costs around $30~ to purchase there, there are another $31.2 in maintenance charges added on to that. Beyond that our prices are in Canadian dollars and not US dollars and we charge no trade fee.
When you factor in their maintenance fees we are on par for most services but our 100GH/s and 150GH/s work out **cheaper** than the CEX.io rate and we are adding nodes to the network!

They didn't say they didn't consult lawyers, or didnt properly file. Since VoS has been operational the political landscape around cryptos has changed dramatically, and they are continuing to face challenges since FinCEN is designed primarily for US institutions.
As a Canadian exchange they have to follow two different sets of regulations that develop on different timelines and in different ways. These guys are nothing short of professional  and are a highly complaint and registered financial institution.
They are specifically taking these steps to prevent "goxings" they want to ensure everything is done to protect their users and not jeopardize the exchange.
The other challenge comes in the fact the US laws on this go state by state and so with the consultation of a diverse legal team their US re-entry will be bit by bit over time, but certainly not something they will shy away from all together.
This is a precautionary measure, everything was being done by the book, but due to the very chaotic political landscape of this industry right now it's not easy to service varied markets and keep by the book.
This was the most professional move they could have made.

Woo!  Not to shabby at all! Thanks for trading with VoS!
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:18:13
Edit: Just double checked on some things, because of the various legal differences state by state it is likely that US members will need to re-verify in most cases. There is too great a difference in all the filing systems and some require us to verify after the time of filing etc.
We will of course make this process as painless as possible and only re-verify individuals where we must.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:00:38
Sadly this isn't something we control - it's up to the third-party Interac vendor who they work with, and it was a challenge to find one that worked with all the big banks.
We're going to keep rolling out more deposit methods though! Working hard to make it easier for ya!

Vault of Satoshi has the worlds first full proof of solvency built to the Bitcoin standard. It allows any logged in user who has ever had a balance of BTC on the site to use both their generated hash and the root hash to validate both their balance and our full proof of reserves.
A user may run the tool at any time but these hash balances are updated every night as they are a large system strain. We also publicly post our cold wallet address that you can check in conjunction with the hash results.
The only thing we don't post is our hot wallet which makes up 2%-5% at most of our reserves. Everything else is laid out in full and updated daily to assure our users of our balances and provide transparent piece of mind.
All the best,

It was quite an undertaking, a lot of time was invested into first figuring out away to do it that is transparent but also safe and secure and doesn't jeopardize an individuals information - and then lead up the development of the system, from what I saw there were certainly a few head scratching moments and he is a really bright guy!
As for other exchanges, I can't speak on their behalf, but I know that our mantra is to "never settle for good enough". Yeah we could have got by on an external audit like other companies do - but why settle? Don't our customers deserve the best? We think they do!

Bits sounds like a part of bitcoin IF you are already familiar with what a Bitcoin is.
Otherwise bits are commonly associated with computer memory and technology.
When brands go through re-working they must consider the perspective of both familiar users, and the general public, as it is the general public that the brand wants to expand into - and I'm sure we can all agree that greater Bitcoin adoption is key.

We're not that much higher than our normal volume actually - most of the increase stems from we are Canada's first exchange to use Instant Interac deposits.

True indeed - we certainly hope that VoS and their legal advisory team can find a way to work with FinCEN and re-enter the US. Competition is good for any industry
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:57:32
No worries - and nope Coin to Coin and Coin deposit/withdrawals are still a go! 
No need to worry about things like that, this more of a "better safe than sorry" so that they can regroup and find out how to better support their customers in a foreign land.
Here in Canada the compliance rules are more straightforward and they know user assets are safe. Right now in the states it's pretty volatile so they need to be over precautious because is this industry customers get left footing the bill for regulation mistakes and VoS doesn't think that's fair at all!

First and foremost you are talking about a capitalized tradeword used in a limited sense in largely different sector (food versus electronics). For example "Apple" vs "apples" or "bits" vs "bits". Plus the Apple trademark is a precursor and it always has been:
"The Apple iPad"
"The Apple Macbook"
You aren't proposing to make it "Bitcoin Bits" but rather a simplified "bits" as a unit of measurement just like "Satoshi's" 
Even though Satoshis is a unique term that people can search it still confused a heck of a lot of new adopters (check out any altcoin Reddit where users measure their value in Satoshi's, as a former mod and current staff at Vault of Satoshi I can tell you the cry for "what is a satoshi?!" is a constant question). Now you are proposing on adding a new term to the Bitcoin vernacular that would get applied to common speech independent of precursor and you are going to create unnecessary ambiguity especially in the adoption stage of a users life cycle.
I'm certainly in no way opposed to standardizing a term for 100 satoshis and making that the default unit. I think that will remove part of the daunting and intimidating nature from Bitcoin that a lot of early adopters feel. "Oh I have to pay $500 and I only have 1 Bitcoin? That doesn't seem like very many!" - It'd be great to over come that, all I am saying is that "bits" is not the right term to use.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:59:35
Given what I now know about security and regulation when dealing with Cryptos, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending another exchange as I don't have any visibility into their process on that. You'd be better asking the community than me - but glad to hear you'll be looking out for our US entry!

@_date: 2014-05-23 04:39:04
We're unable to comment on the situations other exchanges face, but after exploring it both with our bank and our lawyers we're sure we're good to go and that it's nearly impossible to reverse Interac unless a user can prove an actual fraudulent charge has taken place after a full investigation and this is rather rare
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:41:27
From what I understand level 1 accounts (email verified) can do coin to coin deposits but can not do trades to real cash. That's the only limitation you face here/
To make it clear VoS is NOT doing like Mt Gox and halting BTC withdraws etc - all that functionality will continue, and they hope to re-enter the United States but since each state has different regulation and has been a real challenge for a Canadian company they can't continue to operate in that manner.
All US accounts will continue to have coin to coin access, and be able to withdraw/deposit non-fiats just like before. All US dollars will be transferred back tot he users.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:51:46
Right now it's pretty hard for international users to get money into us - we're currently working on our stronger international roll out which we are announcing later this summer. For the time being it's easiest for international users to transfer via coin!
And yes, we do LTC as well as 23 other Altcoins!
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:11:49
I have a feeling that it will be one of the many options they will explore, yet each state has different tax laws, exchange laws, currency laws and corporation laws that need to be considered.
VoS's success is largely contributed due to the fact that for them to be compliant in Canada they need to register and operate as a bank or a financial exchange. These are well established rules and regulations that are easy to set up a business around, where as in the US it's not as clear what rules pertain to a currency exchange dealing in cryptos and they continue to change quite rapidly.
I'm sure the team will explore all the available options and decide how best to proceed and get US users back on board.

The legal ID and proof of residency are required to be two separate pieces. For the ID your drivers license would work, and in most cases we can take something like a utility bill as proof of residence (this will vary a bit state by state, but our verification team will be happy to guide you through the process once your state is available) 
As far as methods, I'm not sure what you mean? Currently after making a deposit in either the US dollar or Canadian dollar users can list an order on our books to buy and sell Bitcoin (or one of many other altcoins). You can simply buy one of the listings, or post what you are willing to pay. It operates in the same fashion as most other major exchanges!

Thanks for your concerns, but the IRS ruling states that for tax purposes Virtual Currency (and Bitcoin) should be treated as a property (
But, for FinCen their March 18th guidance on virtual currencies ( clearly outlines the speciality class for Virtual Currency and those under de-centralized virtual currency, making clear that they are not a non-currency and should be treated (in regards to money transmission) as any other value item. 
They also state that Exchangers (like us) must fall under MSB rulings:


Which is why we register in each state separately to follow their guidelines, and must fall under their rulings as it relates to all currency exchange.
Feel free to read up on those issuance, and thank you again for your concern. I can also assure you that our legal team and compliance officer are far more versed in this than I am, and it's why we listen to them on such decisions.
As an exchange we voluntarily pulled out of the US initially when these regulations came out, this was done in order to insure our safe, legal and fully compliant return which we are now in the early stages of.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:15:32
Hopefully things for coin exchanges don't get as bad as they did for poker. Right now it seems FinCEN just doesn't want to play ball with foreign entities regardless of how compliant they are and how much poutine they offer up!

"We’ve made repeated attempts to comply with FinCEN regulations, but their online form submission process will not allow us to post reports from our headquarters in Ontario, Canada. They refuse to accept printed paper reports, and their drop-downs don’t include Canadian options, making it impossible to the file the required documentation properly in order to comply. Despite repeated inquiries into how to properly file reports from Canada, we have yet to receive a satisfactory response. They’ve literally made it impossible for us to run our business in compliance with their regulations."
It's not as easy as that, being a foreign currency group operating in the US has unique challenges in complying with FinCEN that was more designed for US groups. 
VoS has stated they aren't yet done with the US but they need to halt US operations for now in order to keep their users safe. US users can still trade coin to coin and deposit/withdraw but if they kept going with Fiat trading they could risk being shut down and having assets seized and no one wants to see that.
It's a better safe than sorry strategy, and until headway is made with FinCEN the best thing they can do for their users is make this change. It's sad and it's challenging but it's necessary for the time being.

"Bits" rather than Bitcoins seems to add some additional level of ambiguity to the brand. 
I over hear a discussion about how many bits something has and I Google it and I get a Wikipedia article explaining that its a type of digital memory and I assume the discussion I heard was between programmers.
If I go through that same scenario with Bitcoin, I can Google Bitcoin and learn about it, possibly even adopt it.
I'm not sure why would ever discuss a change from a unique term to a non-unique term. Some may argue that this is only as the "default unit term" in the client, but we know that will be rapidly adopted into common speech and ultimately have an impact on Bitcoin.

We will not be releasing the identity of those users. It is indeed a shame that far to often in this industry that phrase is misused. To some it means trading at a loss on their own service to add liquidity, to others it means paying "market makers" large premiums to boost volume.
For us, it meant finding businesses and individuals that have high-volume long term streams and need to liquidate. This means empowering large merchants and trades by offering them reduced fees (rather than actual payments).
As we mentioned in the video, we held off on this so long on this as it was important for us to find a economically stable and honest way of doing that.

Most of it came from the Interac, we saw most of the spike instantly. The free fees is the icing on the cake - and something people are still finding out about.
Since that announcement (a long weekend) we've done 250 BTC on average a day which is higher than our normal weekday average. Normally on a weekend we do like 15-20 BTC. So it will be interesting to see how the next few weeks play out

These are not the only rules we have to comply with, as there are also considerations at the federal level and in laws relating to our own country. 
We wanted to plan out and begin working on our full US roll-out plan before even opening in our first state. So rest assured there is many more to come.

The FinCen decision is kind of two pronged, on the one hand since it's federal you must report to them; but their restrictions reply to Money Service Businesses which they leave up to each state to define differently.
So follow each states laws, and then report federally.

You would think they would jump at the chance, but their actuaries are so unfamiliar with Bitcoin as a concept that very few are willing to even have talks - but we certainly are excited by this possibility.

Hey GamesManiak,
I wanted to take a quick moment to address this personally!
There is a lot of divided opinion on what you should do with your coins, a large number of people tell you it's best to keep them on your own machine and we respect that.
But, we also realize that there isn't one solution fits all, and at the end of the day some people will choose to keep their coins in our exchange and so we feel it's our responsibility to protect them as best they can when they do that. It is after all inevitable and it would be careless of us to have lax security or holding charges and just go "oh well, shouldn't keep your coins here".
We feel that we shouldn't tell you what to do with your coins. We do encourage you to fully research the risks associated any option and decide what you feel comfortable doing.
While we have stronger security than your home computer, we are also under greater targeting by hackers and that's something to take into consideration.
We're kind of security nuts, so we've thought of all the worst case scenarios we could, and did our best to protect against them, that being said at the end of the day, we can't foresee everything. We are constantly building out our security and adapting it for new threats and we always encourage users to let us know the type of security they would like to see added.
We are rather confident that we lead the industry in security and transparency. That being said, do what is right by you. If you choose to lock down your own wallet:
Explore using paper wallets, and backing up your wallet.dat
If you choose to leave your coins online we aren't going to penalize you, we'll do the best we can to protect your assets as we feel that is our responsibility to you. At the end of the day, I sleep soundly at night with my personal assets sitting in my VoS account.
Let me know if I can answer any further security questions!
All the best

As mentioned we do have public facing ticker APIs that are entirely accessible.
You only need to verify if you are looking to use the API in a way that it manipulates or facilitates trades in which case we are required by law to have your information on file for KYC/AML purpose.
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:57:27
We certainly hope it doesn't come down to that. Businesses that operate on sketchy practices or screw over their users give Bitcoin in general a bad name. As a community/industry, Bitcoin consumers as a whole need to demand more responsible practices from the businesses in this industry.
We all want to see cryptocurrencies continue to grow, both in value  and in adoption - and for this to happen we need to continue to support honest business. We at Vault of Satoshi have always felt we have a responsibility to step up to the plate and be everything we can be on our users behalf. The trust our users place in us is not something to be taken lightly and we should provide every assurance we can afford!
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:31:20
This is incorrect.
Unlike Credit Cards which side with users in a dispute, debit deposits are full file fraud reports to reverse. This means a user would have his full bank account investigate and all transactions explored and be required to prove that a fraud did indeed take place before it would ever get reversed. These investigations are extensive, and in the event that fraud did take place the refund comes out of the banks pocket and not ours.
You can't simply "reverse" a debit transaction done through a point of sale gateway. It's a full blown legal matter that banks handle and it would be just like trying to reverse a wire transfer. It's nearly impossible to do and insurance protected.
User fraud will be a none issue on this front and this is something we investigated extensively prior to this launch.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:30:39
We will be back in ALL the states before long - it's just a matter of having to pick some first due to the logistics of the roll out. I can't comment yet on which ones we are entering first! We'll announce it soon though!
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:08:02
We're actively making it more user friendly and streamlining our financial backend. Due to the large changes Canadian banks went through in operating with Bitcoin businesses there was a short time where everything was in flux so it didn't make sense to spend the time developing an automatic method. Now that things are smoothing not only is this in our pipeline but we are actually going to be adding more deposit and withdrawal methods that should make things much easier for everyone!
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:21:52
We've just re-done our buy/sell page and in our next launch will be pushing those changes live, this is one of the small tweaks we made to the system for ease of use!

Any business in Canada or the United States involving exchange trading is required to collect that ID in accordance with FinCen/FinTrac regulation. Anyone failing to do so is failing to fulfill their KYC/AML requirements.
It's a legal matter that must be followed - and if it isn't then a company would run this risk of assets being seized. We would never put your money at risk and therefore require this documentation.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:52:51
As far as I can tell, yes we are the first exchange to offer public proof of solvency rather than just an audit. At least to this extent.

It's a shame to see that the political landscape presents such challenges of dealing with the US as a foreign institution, that being said it won't keep folks down for ever. It will just be a bit more work for legal teams to find ways to safely comply with the challenging and diverse legal restraints of US exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:48:19
From my understanding it's easier to deal with as it's basically federal regulation rather than individual states, and the stance is coin to coin can be unregulated but coin to fiat you have to register as a currency exchange or a bank and comply to all their normal regulations
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:43:32
It's not by choice that we don't accept healthcare cards, but rather that they do not fulfill our legal responsibility under our MSB's KYC/AML policy. I do apologize for the inconvenience.

In order to do this the company would need a specialty merchant set up on an exchange platform for instant liquidation/purchase of Bitcoin so they could ensure their books continue to work in CAD while the user recieves Bitcoin. At the end of the day these companies don't want to worry about the logistics of buying, pricing and holding Bitcoin.
If you make progress on this you can put them in touch with me directly (adam and we'll be sure to work with them to implement a solution to facilitate their needs via our exchange. As Canada's largest international exchange we'll be able to manage the logistics and let the company focus on what they do best.
Good luck on your mission!

This is a ridiculous notion, first and foremost was right to cite the whitepaper which most people clearly haven't read.
Beyond that regulation can be a good thing - heck it's like salt, a little bit brings out the best flavors in a dish, too much will ruin it, and without any the dish seems to lack a little something.
No one is advocating that Bitcoin should be controlled, or managed by some government entity, or make laws that govern your bitcoins but some basic regulation allowing operation and asset holdings by businesses and banks - this means that:
1. All government entities would agree on whether it is a currency, or a commodity, etc (unlike currently where the IRS says its property and FinCEN says its currency)
2. Banks would know that it is safe to use it and that a country isn't about to ban it at any moment. This is a huge barrier to entry for banks and therefore merchants and is one of the largest risks to the health of Cryptos in general.
3. Merchants would feel safe taking it if their banks were willing to more efficiently deal with it and they knew how it would be taxed and viewed by governments.
Bitcoin is a technology that questions the current monetary system sure, but it is not some extremist movement to rid of a system or exist entirely outside of it.
You'll notice that most of the of the major businesses that provide value to coin (merchants, exchanges, etc) are only able to do so because we can operate inside regulation.
I assume your point is we shouldn't be caring about the rumors about Chinese banking and you're right there, but to think that Bitcoin should exist outside the legal political landscape is a bit of a childish notion. We can change the world without wanting a "chaos to the system" mentality, it's this very mentality that scares a lot of people away from BTC.

Fiat to Coin in Canada can also be done at  we're a Canadian exchange based out of Brantford, Ontario, we've got a physical office that you can come visit (and make debit deposits at), our full team is listed on our website and we do our best to be transparent individuals involved in the community.
We support CDN and USD to Coin options as well as coin to coin trading on many pairs (without having to go through Bitcoin). We have standard 1% trading fees, and are also the only exchange to offer an unlimited trading plan at $99/month which works great for large volume traders!

Heya DiddyMoe,
Thanks for inquiring about Vault of Satoshi - while I encourage you to keep getting user feedback and make your own informed decision I thought I'd reach out and tell you a few things that sold me on VoS before I even joined the team!
1. We put our customers security first. We will never walk the grey line in regulation. We operate in regions and manners that are entirely by the books and therefore allow us to keep your assets safe.
2. We believe in visibility, we let you know who we are, and where we are! We welcome local customers to drop by our office and you can see all our friendly faces on the website! (Except mine as I'm rather new - I need to wrangle the time of one of our dev team to get that up there!)
3. We're available via email, phone, and frequently around on social media! We care about our community and try and get involved!
4. We are always striving to make our service better, we are constantly developing new features (small teaser, we have some exciting industry firsts coming over the next few months) and we take our client feedback seriously!
If you have any further questions I encourage you to reach out to me via email (adam or our support team via the phone numbers listed on our website!

As far as we can have seen, no other exchange offers public proof of solvency. Some have allowed audits where third parties have looked at the balance and said "yup they have what they claim they have!" and a few have offered partial methods.
We didn't think that was enough assurance! So we took it one step further!

Yeah filing with every state, each state has different requirements and many states require large insurance bonds before licensing you to operate there as a money service business. To do it right and by the books you are talking around $8-10 million dollars, so it's certainly not something that can be done at the drop of a hat, but we are pushing hard on our re-entry and rolling it out over time!

Hey there Den,
My name is Adam Cochran, Director of Marketing over at Vault of Satoshi.
As far as safety we are not only a registered business, but also a Money Services Business registered with the government in Canada. We were the world's first Bitcoin exchange to post full "proof of solvency" which allows users to verify our Bitcoin holdings and their account balances.
We require two factor authentication on by default for our website login and transactions.
Our hosting is handled through AWS on the FinCloud which is their Financial security hosting sector that all the big US banks use, and we keep all your private information off of the main trading server for additional security.
For your basic level verification we do require government issued photo ID and a proof of residency (such as a phone bill) that is sent to the address on file.
That is enough to get you trading! If you have any other further questions, feel free to reach out to the team!
All the best,
Adam Cochran

That's correct. CIBC does not offer integration with online Interac at this time.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:54:16
I think a lot of this confusion comes from understanding what FinTrac does. Far too many people seem to think it simply "regulates money" but rather they are focused on minimizing money laundering and financial crimes.
Unlike most sectors of the law, it isn't always black and white which things count and which things don't. It's comes under the legal fields of negligence and due diligence. If your business could easily be used for money laundering, and you are aware of this possibility then you have a responsibility to do what is "within reason" to prevent that and keep appropriate records so that Federal Authorities can investigate if needed.
So does FinTrac have clear classifications of Bitcoin and how it should be handled at the moment? No. Does that mean businesses can conduct themselves without concern or regard for KYC/AML laws in Canada? No.
It's a complicated legal situation but it's just best to do it by the book anyway. Hope that makes a bit more sense! We take these extra steps to secure your money anyway!
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:21:55
We're coming! We really are! We hope to have a bit more info about this in Part 2 of our summer update!
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:55:45
Mike means Coin/Fiat trades are exempt from fees.
Right now it is free to deposit and free to trade. The withdrawals charge the normal bank fees which are fairly cheap depending on your method but this isn't a fee from us
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:08:18
Mainly because in Canada withdrawals are slow to bank accounts and so if your arbitrage gets lopsided or doesn't have enough funds then the switch over can take about a week. I absolutely encourage you to go for it though, especially with our no fee model right now!
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:56:22
That's why we've tried to make it simple and do upfront pricing unlike other competitors.
Here is an example of the economics on it using CoinWarz profitability calculator:
150GH/s cost $900CAD, no cost in power.
Return: 3.11004825 BTC = $1555 CAD at today's market value.
That's excluding any change in the value of the coin price. So it is profitable even if the price stays at it's current value, but if the price of Bitcoin rises it becomes even more valuable.
Even if the difficult were to continue to rise to 11 billion and the price didn't change (which would be unlikely) you'd earn 2.32292119BTC or $1161.46 at today's value and still be making a profit.
If the price rose back up to $600 you'd make roughly $1400 in revenue.
If the price rose back up to $700 you'd make roughly $1700 in revenue.
If the price rose back up to $800 you'd make roughly $1900 in revenue.
If the price rose back up to $900 you'd make roughly $2000 in revenue.
And in case it gets back to it's previous high:
If the price rose back up to $1200 you'd make roughly $2800 in revenue.
So the economics can be tricky and no one can guarantee a price, but the important thing to know is that with Vault of Satoshi packages we've done our best to ensure our clients are extremely likely to profit even if the price doesn't rise; and if you think Bitcoin will rise back up then it is more than worth it to jump in on these contracts!
Hope that answered your questions, and if it doesn't shoot me an email and I'll walk you through it more!

TLDR: Pension funds shouldn't have dismissed an entire new asset class as useless and fraudulent when it needed minimal risk exposure (less than current high-risk assets) to deliver higher returns.
Hindsight is great, it lets you learn from past mistakes through analysis of decision making.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:10:43
The analysis is a commentary on 2015 to present day and noting that pensions should have dismissed emergent asset classes.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:36:57
Pension plans buying into the asset at their scale would certainly change the current market dynamics.
But, given the low exposure they would need to an emerging asset class, and the potential upside its not a bad deal for them.
Plus, if them buying in, kicks off a bull run, then they've just justified their purchase.
Mutually beneficial situation.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:16:03
The same was said of gold, stocks, the dotcom boom. The point is we shouldn't dismiss a new asset class.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:16:20
Personally I just assumed you can't - it's not clear enough on your main page. As a curious potential customer I read the main page and didn't really dig any further. It'd be a great promotional point to really highly and really throw in my face that you can accept coins from everywhere!
