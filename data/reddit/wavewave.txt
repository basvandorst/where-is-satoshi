I've being very happy with it, have multiple multi-signature accounts, some share with my businesses partner. Make sure you use their offline private key generator a ledger wallet for a fully trustless setup.

The problem is VC money subsidizing all new services so that they can only make money when they have 1b users. It fucks every other good piece of software that can be supported by a few bucks. Users become self-entitled to free everything, where they are really selling their privacy.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:51:06
Which plans?
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:57:56
Why the drama then, I'm confused? BitPay has always been a MSB doing KYC/AML.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:53:37
To Argentinians, Russians and other countries with devaluing currencies; Bitcoin is your solution!
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:33:24
Spot on. Or at least move it to multi-signature addresses controlled by the user like Coinkite and Bitgo.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:50:40
I really like what you are doing. 
Do you support hierarchical deterministic keys yet? 
It's something I need to make it work with the other wallet I use.
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:44:17
Stop using amateurs.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:37:19
Why can't more Bitcoin companies be transparent like this. I'm all prepared for tipping on the BitcoinBowl but I wish ChangeTip was more forthcoming with their intentions. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:16:25
When is the pay-wall coming, if one does it they will all do it!
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:35:58
I'm all ready to start tipping!
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:18:56
So much good news, the price will crash! 
Paging @_date: 2014-12-01 23:08:23
lol, I'm sure you are being sarcastic.
In case you are not, they could use Discourse. It's free open source, or  they can pay for them to host it too 
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:10:32
Looks like old php garbage to me. Regardless, many better options these days and with the cash he has, he could just pay a company to do it.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:50:18
They also censor, EVERYTHING else.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:05:49
Or he could use a better system like the open source [discourse.org]( It has much better security than a 2000's PHP nightmare of PHPBB.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:31:55
This is amazing, I think this kind of trustless partnerships is one of the most powerful features of Bitcoin.

[Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( for real money and [Breadwallet]( for spending amounts. For hardware I really like how you can do multisig with Ledger and Coinkite.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:12:23
Where is Coinkite and Coinbin?
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:18:47
No their Multi-Signature wallet is free
@_date: 2015-05-11 11:49:38
I really like Coinkite multisig features and Electrum for offline.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:05:58
This is great, Bitcointalk is awful. Who still uses PHPbb??
Bitcoin is up as trend 
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:36:28
With Coinkite you can setup notifications Email and SMS, it supports Multisig wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:53:58
I rather stick with Fee, because even though you can add a bounty. You can't really get a transaction to confirm with 0 fee.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:53:33
Why does that matter, who's we? 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:19:46
Cool. What is the ETA for some beta and is there any other parties working on their own implementations?
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:00:43
Congrats, that's a big number.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:56:18
I really like Ledger, cheap and works with P2SH
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:58:54
I know, but there is no easy answer. You could reach out to one of the public exit nodes and ask if they would host one just for you.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:16:30
I agree there is a huge drop off, however I'd heard their CEO mention many times they have over 160K funded active wallets, he does not mention how many total (inactive). If we use startup logic, that's probably 10% of their user base and it means they probably have close to 1M users.
Mycellium also mentioned once they have between 50-100K users, so probably 5-10K actives.
And I believe overhearing Trezor has 7K sold.
I go to a lot of conferences and meetups ;)
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:55:59
It's much safer and easier to just support OnionTip.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:32:49
These numbers are utter bullshit. Even r/bitcoin, the most visit Bitcoin property, only has 160,000 subscribers, and If you multiple by 1,000 (for lurkers only) that's still less than 2M users. 
The problem is Coinbase and Blockchain.info are on the VC treadmill so they have to keep inflating numbers for the next round of finance. 
From the comments I read and ppl I talk to, my guess in order of user count: Blockchain.info, Coinbase, Coinkite, GreenAddress, Circle, Xapo, the rest doesn't even register.
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:57:50
Yes, BitPay is definitely legitimate company.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:36:09
The issue is finding good directors and board remembers. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:51:07
Like Coinapult, they are now using the Coinkite API, and I think they are using BitPay for settlement.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:54:08
They have very few users, but it's the same shit.
Also, Coinbase comes to r/bitcoin to piss us off too often.
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:28:15
Thanks, that's perfect.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:34:44
Good work, Coinkite outshines many companies receiving millions in funding.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:37:25
I noticed this too, maybe chain.com could be the replacement. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:54:50
This will be epic!
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:35:00
I don't have an easy answer, I think you will need to test, research and compare himself. Bitcoin.org completely misrepresents the wallets.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:14:54
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:40:35
They launched their wallet first, over 2 years ago. It's not hard to imagine 3rd place player being around for that long. I discussed this with them in Amsterdam, they had a booth there. Their terminal is a secondary business for them.
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:34:54
Going to give this a try now. Does it work with 3 of 5, where 2 keys are 2 Ledgers?
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:14:16
I second. u/changetip 100bits
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:55:04
[This]( wallet offers EOL (End of life) setups.
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:08:13
Maybe you just need a better wallet, I came across [this site]( with comparisons.
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:57:23
Both work well
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:12:39
Great post, specially giving the options to ans explaining the risk for each key option.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:04:12
Use bitcoin services that offer an onion address.
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:59:59
I know a bunch of people from china that have family here in north america who send money between each other via Bitcoin. It's happening!
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:55:45
I upvote most of what they post, they do good for the community.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:41:04
Rodolfo would have to say something very stupid not to get an upvote from me.
