Sweet setup man, damn. Wish I had thought of all that before I decided to get out :) Good to know for whoever ends up purchasing the rig.

The system is set up to be pretty much plug &amp; play so I think it's reasonable. It has Windows 7 64-bit loaded as well as everything you need to start mining (batch files which kick off the miners at startup as well as overclocking &amp; software for remote administration). Once the machine is put together &amp; fired up it should only take a few minutes to get mining. I know it took me a while to set things up and time is money ;) Also, I'll help out whoever buys the rig in case any questions come up.

**Edit:** Now accepting Bitcoins!
@_date: 2011-07-07 02:56:57
Yeah, sure, why not. Price would be 80 BTC.

$140 shipped, not bad. My rig is still worth it :)

1) An $80 PSU will probably die, catch fire, or damage your system within a few months of intense mining. Why would you power a $1,000 system with a cheap PSU? 
2) I have a Windows rig for sale, not a Linux rig. Please read the original post.
3) Why would you try to trash my post like that? I already asked you to PM me if you're interested in buying and obviously you are not... So please don't comment unless it's constructive. Thanks.

Yeah, it's the variance that starts getting really annoying. For instance, we're currently near 4mil shares and still haven't found the block. It's been 22 hours since the last block! Granted, the other day we found 5... But still.. this is wearing down my F5 key.

The invisi-case keeps everything nice &amp; cool.

You forgot the $200 PSU + the HDD. Also, good luck finding 5830s. They sell out within minutes on NewEgg. In addition, the system will come pre-configured so you can just fire it up, put in your worker credentials and be mining within minutes. Time is money, my friend. This is the perfect rig for someone trying to get into mining or for someone without much time to set up a new system.
And no, I won't take $400. Please PM me if you have a serious offer. Thanks.

Nice breakdown, sir. Upvote for you!
@_date: 2011-07-06 23:33:39
They're free if you buy the rig ;)
@_date: 2011-07-18 22:24:37
Hey, thanks for the reply. PM me if youre interested in the rig. System is only a few weeks old and the components are all top brands/quality.

Not a hack, but a suggestion. For the love of god, add a way to quickly and easily deposit funds... If you do this, you will be the Don of Bitcoin. The pain in the ass + lag in depositing funds keeps a ton of people from investing in BTC. Just my .02 :)

While vastly different from Tulip mania in many ways, what is going on right now surely feels like a mania... tulip or otherwise. Something for the history books, no doubt.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:41:19
That was quick. I hope you had time to read the rest of the post...
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:55:37
I wouldn't go so far as to say that they aren't even *remotely* the same. There's surely a mania driving the price action of BTC right now. Take a look at the charts... Also, and slightly unrelated, I don't think that a fixed supply ensures anything in terms of price stability.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:01:37
Cool analysis, bro.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:04
Which is speculative.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:47:03
Looks like everyone is latching on to the Tulip mania reference and ignoring the rest of the post... Sounds like I need an edit :)
