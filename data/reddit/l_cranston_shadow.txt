I haven't been following this closely, only to the extent that I know that there has been a long running and fairly acrimonious debate about forking based mostly around a disagreement about block size limits (a topic I understand only in broad strokes).  
Can anyone tell me just briefly what the argument against forking is? Is it a lack of consensus for any one solution, or something else? From what I understand, the status quo is not viable in the long term, so even from a layman's perspective this opposition confuses me.

Out of curiosity, why use an online version as the primary source for help files? Is this so that you can update the files more quickly/easily than you would otherwise, presumably with the next version release?  
&amp;nbsp;  
In terms of the BRIT exchange? Do you change the fixed set of addresses every release or X number of releases? If not then I'd suggest that doing so would be good policy to do so for privacy reasons. An attacker could of course get the new list of addresses with each release, but it would be more work than having the same list to work off of in perpetuity.

As soon as they stop being able to get their money out via traditional means (ATMs, withdrawal via a teller, and ACH), what makes you think that they'll still be able to buy bitcoins with their bank balances?

bitcoin ≠ blockchains, blockchain ≠ bitcoin  
&amp;nbsp;  
Blockchains are an idea that was long overdue and will have affects on transactions and data transfer for a long time. Bitcoin is a fad at best and at worst a pump and dump scheme kept alive by collective delusion. The fact that bitcoin happens to rely on blockchains doesn't tie them together inexorably and IMO it is a disservice to do so.

What was the point of using Bitcoin though? Other than to stroke your ego to say that you were able to use Bitcoin for the transaction, was there any advantage to doing so?  
I would argue that you actually lost out. Not only did you pay the regular convenience fee (call that a draw since you'd pay it anyway), you more than likely paid at least 1% more because of the added cost to you for your bitcoin. In return, you got zilch for your added cost. It may be only pennies but it adds up and the lack of a clear use case is where this type of evangelism fails.
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:09:02
Well put, but all of those things you mentioned happening, and arguably all the progress that have been made, are shown to be pretty much for naught if the goal really is to have BTC really be worth US &gt;$1250, or whatever its exact lifetime high was.  
I tend to think that the goal, if there is one, shouldn't be a set price point, but many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many^many people here constantly and vocally disagree, to the point that the front page of this sub often has multiple posts with that very premise. If that is indeed the goal then I would argue that in the last 4 years, we have failed as adoption has slowed, especially among larger companies and some companies have either backtracked on promised implementation or removed bitcoin as a payment offer after offering it.  
.  
Edit: Lest people think I am taking a one sided view of adoption, the fact that NASDAQ and the NYSE are interested is...interesting; however, interest does not equal adoption and they are not going to be adopting bitcoin as we know it so it's really only relevant on a technical level, not on the level of them adopting the whole currency as we see/use it.

Not sure if this is a recent change but if you go to [multibit.org]( now, it will actually stop you from downloading until you click that you agree to the terms and conditions. The [terms and conditions]( are surprisingly human readable and the first item on them is that there is a fee.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now, whether a short human readable blurb on the same page as the accept button would be preferable and better than a separate page is arguable but studies have shown that nobody reads big long TOS/T&amp;C statements before clicking yes so I think the devs did the best they could to make sure people have every chance to see the fees before clicking, short of shooting themselves in the foot to do so.

There is a financial impact for Mr. Draper though if the bid is released. Also, there is the matter of the government guaranteeing privacy for both the winner and the winning price. On the surface the latter would seem to be more important, since he could try to sue the government if they broke those terms.  Personally, I think that wouldn't happen, but it would be bad for the Marshal's service's future auctions and would do real damage to multiple government agencies if the US Marshals were forced to break their own agreement.

I'm not a lawyer, and I definitely don't know the caselaw for FOIA cases, but, four strikes me as relevant if only because he can show that there is a real risk for a price movement if this information is revealed which hurts his business. The price he paid is akin to the price a private equity firm pays for an asset, it is proprietary and business confidential information. I'm sure there's more than a few relevant cases that also would apply here.  
.  
In terms of personal privacy, the term "interests" IMO seems to be key. I'm guessing you're a lawyer, would you say that curiosity would hold any sway, not just in a court but even in an administrative setting (such as the FOIA office) as being a "legitimate" interest? The issues with the government (either the FOIA office or the courts) determining legitimate interest aside, I have never heard of a case where curiosity has been counted as a legitimate interest for any kind of disclosure by anyone.  
.  
Edit: I realize that private equity might not have been the best example since there often are disclosure requirements, but substitute any other firm with private holdings that they have a legal right to keep the cost basis of secret and you get my point.

Doesn't that pretty much defeat the point of bitcoin though if it is just a person to person transaction? I believe the technology already exists in Japan where you are literally sending money that is stored (or at least represented) on your phone to someone else's phone and that's what bitcoin becomes if that's all that gets done. It makes bitcoin no better than bank supported options to do the same thing.

Except that it will probably be years before any of their suppliers take bitcoin and there's a chicken and egg problem which is that there are real added costs in the meantime with very little benefit. They are one of the two main players when it comes to the password wallet business (the other being Onepass) and many if not most of the people who would be their customers are going to make their decision whether they accept bitcoin or not.  
.  
That's not including the people who might have bitcoin but would prefer to use another option. I don't know their finances, but there is almost no chance that the gains would justify the cost and trouble of implementing and running it with a very shaky premise of there being eventual widespread adoption and greater gains.

I'm not sure anything could "end" bitcoin at this point. What could, and to a certain extent has, happened is the duldrums for bitcoin. Bitcoin has it's value because it can be bought, sold, and traded for fiat and goods, but I'd be willing to bet that the people using it aren't ma and pa at their farm. People here make a big deal about this small retailer or that now accepting bitcoin because someone told them about it, but do you honestly think that anyone except people who already have bitcoin are going to pay that retailer in it considering the extra steps to get it? Until/unless that hurdle is overcome, it is going to be bitcoin junkies buying and selling to bitcoin junkies which means the price is more or less going to be in bubble and crash mode above it's sustainable point, which is below where it is right now. There is no impetus for any real appreciation in its price.

Not easily and transparently in a way that is easy for someone who's never used bitcoin can immediately use to get their money into their bank account, especially outside of specific parts of the world. There are a few exchanges that seem to do FIAT 1 &gt; Bitcoin &gt; FIAT 2 ok, but then you get the issue of withdrawal and real name verification (which takes time and effort).  
.  
Western Union being able to identify the recipient in person without them having to learn item one about bitcoin which be a huge advantage, even if they are more expensive. It's hard for many people here to understand it, because we're mostly techies and we all know how bitcoin works, at least to the extent that we can use it reliably. That isn't, and probably will never be, true for most of the population. Even if Bitcoin is still in its infancy and general knowledge, as well as new methods for bringing Bitcoin to the public, increase, that's going to remain so. That's the niche that firms like WU will fill. It's akin to their current niche of people who can't or won't get bank accounts and deal with international transfers of money that way.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:54:33
Do you think that everyone has the knowledge or the ability and willingness to learn the ins and outs of bitcoin, including buying, transferring, and selling? It's always been possible to bypass countries like Western Union; however, their business model exists because of a lack of ability to access the regular banking system, a lack of knowledge, and/or the lack of ease of use.  
.  
Any company that's going to let you put in cash in one ATM and either give you a transferrable method (like a QR receipt) for someone to withdraw it in another country at an ATM using that receipt or let people create accounts at both ends (probably using something simpler than bitcoin addresses for identifiers), and use deposit to account&gt; send &gt; withdraw from account as the method, is going to essentially be duplicating Western Union, except with lower fees and less recognition.

Western Union could easily use Bitcoin as the transactional vehicle to move money between nations if they so chose.

There's a potential fire hazard, nobody knows if a fire will actually happen and a fix may or may not be in the works from the people who built and maintain the building.  
.  
Just in case though, all of the other tenants want the biggest tenant to move out some of its sub-lessees because statistically the people in those units are more likely to cause/contribute to a fire if one were to occur. So despite the absence of fire, the largest tenant needs to evict a certain number of sublessees, leave some of its currently empty units empty, and if it does want to sublease more of its units it needs to charge more so people are less interested in them, despite them being a good landlord.

I'd agree that a small vocal minority are trying to affect them, but that's hardly a sizable portion. If it weren't for the neverending outcry by those people, the larger stakeholders who have left GHash never would have considered leaving.

It wouldn't drop to zero but it would probably drop quite a bit unless they were also paying their suppliers and their employees in bitcoin.

If people are buying specifically buying for these transactions then the net effect is zero since they effectively cancel each other out, not accounting for fees or fluctuation in relative values between btc and fiat. If people are holding anyway then the price effect of these specific transactions are going to be negative.  
.  
The big question then is, are most of the people paying these transactions going to be buying just for this or people who keep bitcoins in a wallet to spend on this and other things? I honestly have no clue what the answer to that is, but it would be interesting to know.

This is actually not very helpful for two reasons. First of all, there is absolutely no chance that they are holding bitcoins, so at best the price effect is neutral.

Second, there is still zero incentive for anyone to buy bitcoins specifically for this type of transaction.

That's doubly true when it isn't even their fault, it's an issue with the protocol, so expecting them to hurt themselves to deal with a protocol issue is insane.

At that point most people are going to be so used to using the banks' safe, user friendly front-ends that they won't want to route around them without a good reason. There won't be enough momentum to give people a good reason to change the way that they do business. That's especially true when routing around the banks is less friendly, less safe unless you know what you are doing, and harder for most people to wrap their heads around.

Ok smart guy, how are businesses expected to accept a currency that the government says that they can't? More to the point, how are regular people supposed to change dollars (to use an easy example) into bitcoins and visa versa as needed if the only way to exchange them is via the black market in person? Even more relevant, won't that kill any supposed efficiency in using them versus using the dollars since they will be much harder to use?  
.  
I think you'll find that no black market currency has survived without the consent of the government where it would be held and traded, much less one that wants to be used widely and globally.  
.  
I'd even argue to say that the black market assets, if you prefer to see bitcoin as an asset, that exist and are traded, are severely hindered by the fact that governments don't accept their trade. To use an example, and ignoring the issue of increased supply that might result, if governments allowed the ivory trade (which thankfully they do not), don't you think that it would be much more widely held and traded?

If it was really the case of them having to risk shutdown or capitulate to every demand of the government, despite it being clear that the government has the right to make those demands (at least for non-fiat holding/transactions) then why are only two exchanges (to my knowledge) preemptively kowtowing to the government (Coinbase and Bitstamp?) are they the only exchanges that are possibly subject to US enforcement action?

I gather that they currently use EFT (Electronic Funds Transfers) and other methods to send money between countries within their system. There would be nothing stopping them from exchanging into and out of Bitcoin in each country instead. That would only work if Bitcoin was legal and regulated in both the sending and receiving country though and could be done facing the user or solely on the back-end.  
.  
Edit: I know that they only would do exchanges to take profits and top of reserves in each country as needed to address imbalances and not per transaction. Using bitcoins rather than EFTs could still save them money.

If they're smart about it, which seems to be the case, then that's all they need. Good operations use multisig to make sure that no one, or even two or three, people can move money out of a cold wallet, and they use other protections to make sure that the cold wallets are secure and backed up. If that's the case then paying to insure the cold wallets is just wasteful.

That "ad" is inaccurate because it doesn't include the fact that you are also paying 1%+ to convert from a widely usable currency to bitcoin. I say widely usable not as a slight against bitcoin but because even with certain companies accepting it, the vast majority of the population can still pay for almost nothing that they need to spend/transfer money for with bitcoin and thus it still is useless in day to day life except for very specific purposes.  
.  
Edit: To the point of remittance, even though I have never used them, Western Union offers undeniable simplicity which is also to their advantage. Most people are not going to learn the ins and outs of bitcoin and go through the know your client / identity verification steps, much less the sometimes time consuming process of adding a bank account (which many people who send remittances don't have to begin with). Bitcoin ATMs are never going to become ubiquitous enough to cut out exchanges in that way, Localbitcoins is too much work too for that purpose, and when Western Union requires some ID verification but makes it simple, people are going to go with the simple choice.

The people who cared about making the most money kept their money with GHash. Only the dumb panicky people and the suckers who believed the 51% attack fearmongering moved their money and they lost potential profit because of it. In the end, very little changed too. GHash agreed to cap their CPU power percentage, but the public outrage probably would have done that anyway.

How would that work? I'm assuming that Havelock isn't giving out the contact details of every holder of shares to the company as a matter of routine so unless they fail in one of several ways, out of many more possible ways, that allows them to do so as part of their failure, then it's a total loss for the shareholders.  
.  
Then again, Petamine was able to (ostensibly) check survey email addresses against shareholder addresses when doing the ghash/p2pool survey so it is possible that they have them off-site. Then again, unless they were to confirm it, the assumption has to be that they just were reading the emails off of Havelock and haven't backed them up.

"Solution" 1 is a great way to kill bitcoin. Nobody, and I mean nobody, is going to download the ~10gb of blockchain, either manually or via a torrent, to be able to access their wallet. Even serious users are going to be reluctant to do so unless mining is tweaked so that a techie on their laptop or desktop can see some (even if it isn't much) benefit from doing so, which just isn't the current case with the current way mining has to be done to receive any payback for the time, effort, and money spent on electricity and hardware.

Unless I'm missing something, your math is a bit off. 51% (really 50% plus some trifling decimal place) is needed for one pool to **theoretically** sabotage the network.

See my reply to your other comment, the risk factors, especially for an established publicly traded company with (to my knowledge) no vendors or workers accepting bitcoin, much less tax authorities, makes the idea of them holding bitcoin almost laughable.  The companies that currently take bitcoin hold, or at least claim to hold, bitcoins are privately held and mostly small companies.
Micro transactions are great, but not if they require extra complicated steps to complete. If the process is as simple as putting in your credit card number, Coinbase buys you bitcoin, and then those bitcoins go to Time's account, then that would work well for most people. At that point though, what good is Coinbase or bitcoin? Anything more complicated than that is going to turn people off.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:39:37
Fairly accurate actually. As much as bitcoin boosters may hate to admit it, bitcoin isn't mainstream or even close to mainstream. The fraction of stores that accept and products that can be bought directly with bitcoins (i.e. not by going through a time and energy consuming third step like gyft) is not even infinatesimal at this point.  
.  
There's actually a bit of cognitive dissonance in that regard since the same people who want bitcoin to be more widely adopted are the same ones who dislike big corporations (including banks) and would cry foul if bitcoin were adopted (arguably co-opted) by them, (again, especially by banks).

For one thing, if they're converting immediately back to cash then that is a downward pressure on the price.

You do realize that only in bitcoin is a company blamed for not purposefully sabotaging itself so that it cannot grow past a certain size, right? If you were to tell any business, in any sector of the economy, in any country, that they had to do that or automatically be considered evil, you'd be laughed at and thrown out of the room.

The fact that you are couching your ideas in the idea that size = threat because of bitcoin's design, does not make your idea any less ludicrous here.

Edit: I'd also note that Bitcoin was also designed to be a group effort that was friendly to new users and to a wide variety of users. Mining has become the exact opposite of that, dominated by a (relatively) small cartel of people and companies that can afford tens of thousands of dollars worth of hardware. They're all working in the vain hope that they'll make enough, fast enough, so that the price of electricity and/or the difficulty doesn't outpace their hardware before it is paid off.

So making it technically more feasible to commit fraud and theft is the solution to theoretical, but unproven, risks of fraud and theft? I'm just talking about the non-outsourceable problems, not the trees, which I can't entirely wrap my head around.

Because, even though they aren't a bank, they have to follow all sorts of laws when it comes to knowing who is sending money to whom and to an extent for what purpose. They can't knowingly transmit money for something that could be illegal in the receiver or sender's jurisdiction, which bitcoin qualifies as. To avoid that mess it's easier just to ban it.  Anti-money laundering is another concern, which is why competitors like Paypal give people problems sometimes when it comes to precious metals purchases (especially person to person purchases) when the memo outs such purchases.

One great thing about Bitcoin is that all you get by "dishonoring" the founding principles is that a bunch of loudmouths say bad things about you.

Add to that the fact that they, along with most companies and people who aren't hobbyists or have a vested interest in bitcoin, have huge disincentives to hold bitcoin because the price fluctuates massively within short periods of time. Their shareholders would, with good reason IMO, sue them if they held bitcoins, because of the high risk.

Also, everyone knew the auction would happen eventually, but, since nobody knew when, the occurrence was Weill unexpected and not necessarily already built into the price.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:29:27
I believe not because you are not buying a contract for the actual product, the contract is in effect only a bet of the price backed, not by the product, but by counter bets and NADEX's reserves.

Changetip is great, and did an especially great job of absorbing all of the Bitcoin refugees from bitcointip. I can't however shake the feeling that Changetip lost a lot of the momentum, and dare I say popularity, that was built up by bitcointip. Some of that is of course natural, but is there a better way for us the users to get the word out there, besides of course using Changetip in public comments?

I agree with not showing your keys, even the encrypted ones, if you have to. Your statement about sending paper wallets in the mail is just baseless paranoia though.  
.  
A paper wallet is just a folded piece of paper. Even as a colored folded piece of paper, which would make it stand out slightly more through an envelope, it's ridiculous to think that it would be singled out. Do you have any idea how many folded pieces of paper in envelopes to through the US mail system each day? I don't know but I'm guessing it's in the millions since 22 million mail pieces are delivered per hour ^[source]( I don't know how many of those are colored and folded pieces of paper, but probably quite a few.  
.  
The only way that it's at all remotely possible that your wallet would get taken is if the person who took it had prior knowledge that you were sending it and knew who you were sending it to and/or when you were sending it. Even then, unless we are talking about someone who knows the victim or the receiver (and knows the wallet is being sent) AND works for the USPS AND will be in an area with access to the mail, there are so many easier ways to get access.  
.  
Edit: per the link above that I gave, I honestly don't know if they include packages in that mail piece count since they split packages out farther down the page in their statistics. If packages are separate then pretty close to all of the 22 million pieces would be (color and black and white) pieces of paper.

It isn't usage, it's Ponzi, except some weird closed circle Ponzi scheme. People buy bitcoins, immediately give them to a merchant for product, that merchant immediately (or almost immediately) sells the bitcoins to another buyer, rinse and repeat.  
.  
I'm not entirely buying into the idea that people need to buy and hold for bitcoin to be successful; however, small businesses and more importantly individuals need to be getting payments in bitcoins, not just buying them to immediately spend them, to have any impact on the currency.  
.  
Can you honestly say that you know anyone who's been paid in bitcoins or received bitcoins without buying them to either hold onto or immediately spend? That was a rhetorical btw, you don't need to answer.

Since you mention incentives and risks, it's worth noting that the scenarios that you make mention of have all been thorougly debunked because:

A) trying anything would kill GHash

B) only the stupidest people, i.e. the ones who accept zero or low confirmation transactions, would be affected  
.  
C) they make more money now, even with this drummed up controversy, than they probably ever would off double spending before getting caught and losing their power to continue.

I'd like to note at this point that I wouldn't have before but you people convinced me to buy 6.58889108 Ghz to give it a try, so thanks for that. I realize that since I'm pretty much buying mining time from someone else, and not mining myself, it is pretty inconsequential, but I figured I'd note it. It's all because it's all thanks to you people who got me interested enough to check out GHash and CEX.  
.  
Edit: I'm not sure the miners really care what reputation they're getting from the bitcoin equivalent to the Luddites (those backwards people who smashed mechanical looms during the industrial revolution). Even if they did, there's nothing to hold the miners who've publicly switched to actually doing it or to staying with p2pool for any amount of time before going back or going to another pool. In the end, even the threat of you and your merry band of vocal critics crashing the price of BTC (which as I've explained in other comments, is on you, not on GHash et al.), doesn't change the math, which is that equipment and electricity are expensive so nobody is going to mine for less than the max since that increases the risk of them sooner or later losing money.

In the long term the Bitcoin Foundation may be redundant, unecessary, and even outright harmful. In the short term though it seems to be a necessary evil, if only because it provides a single entity that other entities can talk to and which represents at least some of the major interests involved in bitcoin.  
.  
Like it or not, even in a decentralized system there are nexuses (nexii?) of power, in the case of bitcoin that is mostly the exchanges, and they have to be able to push their interests. The foundation is essentially that body, except that it ostensibly also represents the other stakeholders as well.

Most people won't have the knowledge or necessarily the interest in learning all of the ins and outs of Bitcoin. It's the same way with remittance currently through WU and other companies.

Not all financial information is going to hurt a non-governmental party if released though.

It would seem, from the representative's statements that they are doing just-in-time fulfillment of their orders, meaning that that they are putting the order through on the exchange as the order comes in. That would make sense since they are in essence buying the BTC on the exchange as they sell it to the customer for what they bought it at plus their fee/spread, or for the reverse selling it on the exchange as they buy it from the customer for what they sold it on the exchange for minus their fee/spread.  
.  
In theory they could keep a buffer, which would minimize transaction times for their customers (since their customers could get their BTC or cash instantly out of the buffer) but they'd still have to do an exchange transaction to lock in the price and protect against price swings, not to mention to refill the portion of the relevant buffer (BTC or CAD) that they just depleted.  
.  
However they do it though, they need to have a supply of BTC and CAD (which I am presuming is the external currency they use) and the reason they need it for each exchange is short of exchanges agreeing to allow people to deposit their fiat and/or BTC in a single pool with each exchange being able to check the balance of and withdraw from that pool, the "money" (for lack of a better word) needs to be on hand when each order is executed.  
.  
To your example, If they were using two exchanges that would require them to have 75k in dollars in cash in each exchange (2x75,000 = 150,000) and 75k in BTC in each exchange. In effect they'd have only half of the reserve available in each exchange than if they only used one exchange which is the downside for them if they don't have the funds and/or liquidity to sink that much money into sitting there until it has to be used.

 A tiny number of people may be interested enough to look into bitcoin and I'm betting no more than a small fraction of those will go as far as to set up an account at Coinbase or somewhere else, much less buy bitcoins.

Yeah, except all the people who can stop you from doing anything but person to person exchanges between bitcoin and any other currency and the ones that can (in theory) punish you for exchanging goods and service for bitcoins. For an example of both, see the Florida crackdown on Localbitcoins.

Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum and odds are that Bitcoin will, absent some catastrophic collapse of the dollar and whatever the next global reserve currency is, never become the primary currency that people can use to get paid, pay all of their bills, and do all of their shopping in.

You still have to be able to easily convert it back into full bitcoins. Am I correct in my math that 1 bit = 1/1,000,000th of a bitcoin (1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin o), which also means that 1 bit = 100 satoshis?  
.  
My point being, that it is still very confusing which is a big obstacle to adoption. That's assuming too that people can be convinced to only (or at least mainly) use bits plus the two forms that are absolutely vital and cannot be disused (satoshis, as the smallest unit, and bitcoins, as the largest).  
.  
Edit: Someone also please correct me if I'm wrong, 1 bit = 0.000001 bitcoins, which also makes it confusing to do offhand (not after stopping and thinking about it for a second) because that is only 6 decimal places behind the 0, versus 7 places for 1 million in front of a zero.  I'll admit I wasn't great in math, but I did OK in it and I had to do a little quick figuring to remember that. I'm sure many people won't want to bother.  
.  
Edit: I want to make it clear that I'm all in favor of simplifying the system and I think that will be great for overall ease of use and adoption. I'm just highlighting as what I see as a few big issues in getting people to pick it up. Even if it's simpler than the current system of milibits, centibits, etc..., it still is a lot for people to remember because many people aren't great with that level of decimal precision.

Blaming them for that, while convenient, is naive. No company should be accepting transactions with zero confirms.

Except that skeptics like me have been right since it reached it's peak at 1200 and then dropped like a stone. Yeah, there was some appreciation in the price before it started skyrocketing but when it really started to move that was one action and it hasn't moved possibly anywhere near like that since, this current movement being no exception.  
.  
The self pleasing circular support on this subreddit aside, there is no factual basis for an increase. That was also the problem with bitcoin when it hit it's bubble, the only price support it has over it's stable price (around 300-500 it seems) is the speculators who say that it is going to go "too the moon," which is why it inherently crashes back down again.

A few major brands, and a number of minor ones have started accepting bitcoin, that's great. That being said, except for people who already have it and want to spend it, and the hardcore fanatics, people aren't rushing to buy bitcoin to buy stuff. That's the dirty little secret that I'm sure many here acknowledge privately but would never admit because it would show that while bitcoin is a good idea, it is a failure without some impetus to make the every day Joe switch, which of course factors into it's stable, but not increasing actual value.

I'm sure companies are allowed a certain amount of risk, although I'm sure that varies per company and per type of business. That being said, the previous, and quite frankly still present, risk of bitcoin being turned into a black market currency by regulation (i.e. banned from all but underground and hand to hand trading) along with the wild price swings, makes it IMO beyond risky.  
.  
I hate to make an argument that makes it sound like I only support the "right" kind of people buying in, but to a a certain extent that's true. The quality, i.e. whether people will continue to use bitcoin to make transactions and IMO more importantly hold bitcoin, as well as the quantity will decrease. Eventually there will be a cliff where adoption will slow to a trickle because you will have exhausted the pool of ~~suckers~~ interested and technologically coherent potential users who have the knowledge and the interest to learn how bitcoins work and adopt it.  
.  
The alternative, as I stated in another comment, is to make bitcoin all but transparent to the user, at which point Coinbase becomes just another credit card processor and every transaction is price neutral outside of their closed little system.

Except nobody uses just Bitcoin. Unless you are one of the tiny percentage of people working for a company that pays you in bitcoins directly (primarily dark web markets and gambling sites at this point), you're still paying for a conversion. It is intellectually dishonest not to take that into account when it is an added cost versus SU and other fiat transmitting businesses.

They could, but there would be little advantage for them to do so. Presumably the retailer can choose which currencies to accept and there is no chance in hell that Wal-Mart et al. would enable bitcoin. It's in fact more likely that they'd protest NCR adding it and making them (the retailers) do more work to disable it.

To a certain extent that remains to be seen, but if the market were truly self limiting then this A) wouldn't be an issue that pops up time and again, and/or B) would be an issue that pops up either once or multiple times and then disappears because of immediate effect.

How do? People generally have fiat in both their physical or electronic wallet. They may sell or buy things with it and get paid in it but unlike Bitcoin, most people aren't obtaining with another currency solely to give it away again immediately, at least not willingly.

Both are sold on the open market so they can increase and decrease in value.   The risk can be charted out.
If you consider the whole bitcoin system randomly failing (as unlikely as that is) being one level of risk, GHash is two levels in as:
- (Bitcoin failing &gt; GHash failing)
While petamine is 3 levels in at least
- (Bitcoin failing &gt; Havelock failing &gt; Petamine failing
That extra level of risk might not seem like a lot but each level is something new that can go wrong. There are actually more things that can happen, including each of those trading for zero without a complete collapse and other adverse effects that can all but wipe out your investment.  
My point though, and the tl;dr is that investing with Petamine is inherently and objectively taking a greater risk because there are more potential points of failure between you and your investment.

Edit: Sorry, meant objectively, not subjectively.

It's inherently an extra point of failure. I've been informed that Petamine has email addresses of shareholders backed up so they could restore people's holdings somewhere else if Havelock failed, somewhat mitigating the damage, but it's still a big point of failure that would cause problems if it failed. That's in addition to the (unlikely) threat of Petamine failing, which IMO is roughly equivalent to that of GHash failing.

Like Bitcoin ATMs?  Needless to say those aren't catching the world on fire. You can hold out as long as you want, there is a fundamental issue with bitcoin in that it it relies, and for at least the foreseeable future will continue to rely, on fiat currencies like the Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen, Yuan, Ruble, Rupee, etc... . Until that changes, bitcoin is, for all but those who are dedicated enough to overcome the hurdles, very limited in how useful it can be to the general public and how much it will be adopted. That leads to a number of very interesting catch-22's as well.

First of all, the dollar isn't deflationary, it is a tiny bit inflationary. If you mean bitcoin as a deflationary currency then you are pretty much just conceding the point. Bitcoin lenders are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the design of bitcoin so it probably can't compete with banks when it comes to lending and interest.  Also, you're putting the cart before the horse. I challenge you to find any major bank that has removed their lending services. Some have made them more expensive/harder to apply for, but that's hardly the death knell for bank lending, nor is the Lending Club IPO.

Except that to most people, and arguably for most people, fiat money isn't broken. When you can take out a bill or your card and have money on hand without visibly seeing any credit card fees, why would you pay a (admittedly small) percentage of your money to send it to a third party, have it exchanged into some foreign concept of money, and then, only if the merchant accepts it, spend it like regular money?  
.  
There is zero appeal to the every day consumer. Even if every merchant accepted it, most people would not see the reason going through the extra hassle. On that note, ubiquitous two way ATMs are a must for bitcoin to be at all consumer viable, as in on the scale of BofA or Wells Fargo (two very large US banks with ATMs in pretty much every city and most towns), are a must. Moreso though, people need a reason to switch. 
.  
Lower fees, at least with with the currently required level of hassle, especially the current inability to have a bitcoin delineated card or wallet that converts from fiat to bitcoin on a per transaction basis, and statements about the "evil Fed and their four fiat stallions of the apocalypse" are not enough by a long shot.

That sounds good in theory but practically speaking, if a handful of major countries ban bitcoin then not only will they not be worth very much, they won't be very useful. Unless you live in a country where you can convert and/or spend them, then it doesn't matter what you do with them because short of converting and then laundering them through another country, they are just worthless bits.  
.  
Obviously sending bitcoins between countries is free; however, exchanging them for Dollars, Euros, Yuan, Yen, Rubles, etc... isn't and it isn't free or easy to send the money back to you so it can be used if bitcoin, and by extension transactions linked to bitcoins, are banned in your country.

Paypal is taking it up with the merchant but in the case of US citizens (which doesn't seem the case here), it is also up to the user to know the law and not violate it. The fact that these clearly weren't US citizens convinces me that reporting the transactions to the government really was a move to cover their own ass with the federal government. Otherwise, Paypal seems fairly justified in telling the retailer that they have to either remove the items, remove Paypal as a payment method for those items, or drop Paypal as a payment method altogether.

Class action against whom?  The federal government can't be sued except with their consent and there's no way they'd consent to something like this, for so many reasons.
Besides, the government has historically claimed the right to control commercial dealers of property (shippers, pawn shops, gem and gold dealers, auction houses, art houses, coffee houses, etc...) which so far has been FinCEN et al.'s focus. If backed into the corner then the government would probably do what the status quo is now, which is only watch exchanges (and presumably they'd start watching large businesses, using interstate commerce or something similar as the reasoning) and let individuals slide.

In terms of your example though, Kim Jong Un is part of two systems, the global system and the local system. In the global system you're right, he is very poor and so are "his" people. In the local system though he is a king among men so centralizing power has become very profitable for him. I don't get where you're going with other countries not centralizing personal freedoms because all countries centralize them to an extent, with the exception of Somalia. Any country that has a rule of law is in effect centralizing personal freedoms and the basis for that is the centralized control of the government.

At ~10 minutes per correct hash, 6 confirmations would give ~60 minutes (since 10 minutes isn't a constant time per block) for someone to notice something was up, raise the alarm, and enough people to act to mitigate the issue before it became indelibly locked in. That definitely seems reasonable, but that reduces the usability of bitcoin for faster transactions if that is required for security/reliability.

That is the most uninformed statement ever. Of course that isn't the reason, do you really think that they care if people are using their product for bitcoins?

Even bitcoin trends towards centralization because that corresponds, at least in the short term with convenience, efficiency, and the principle of efficiency of scale . The best example is MtGox which, until it failed, was at least on the surface the best deal for consumers because everyone was using it, which meant lower fees and deeper volumes in their order book (which also meant a lower bid/ask spread).  
.

There was at least some basis for the price reaching $1200 last time. Bitcoin was big in the news, despite some setbacks (China), it was growing, and if I remember my timeline correctly, there were at least rumblings of big retailers considering integrating it. Right now bitcoin is status quo ante (the way things were before), except that there is nothing new going on, unless you count the fact that China has gone a little while without threatening to ban it... again.

That, and the value to the individual of one person's supply of drugs does not fluctuate based on the supply and demand or price of anyone else's supply or the availability. With bitcoin on the other hand, even after you purchase them, their value in your posession, both objectively compared to other currencies and in terms of practical usability, are dependent on there being other people who are willing and able to buy and sell theirs. Make bitcoin illegal, to hold, buy and sell, or to use to purchase goods and services, and most of that practicality and those other users disappear, which pretty much destroys the value of your stash.

What the extremists here don't get is that most people like (most of) what comes from fractional reserve banking, like the ability to have a lot of capital available for loans. In a metal or bitcoin based economy you'd still have lending but nowhere near as much and it would be much more expensive because nobody wants to lock in their money for the length of a loan unless they're getting a lot for it.  
.  
Consider a 15 year mortgage, even with 1960's style traditional banking (that is to say, no fancy stuff), if deposits are paying for the bank to give a mortgage loan then none of the account holders (financial backers) are out that money for 15 years until the loan is entirely repaid. As it is an indirect loan they are also not getting paid directly from the mortgage that was written by their money, only indirectly as part of the interest the bank pays. Neither the interest nor that loan is possible without fractional reserve. The only way to do a loan would be for someone to back it all at once and have the bank (if it wasn't directly backing the loan itself) act as an intermediary paying the interest plus principle, minus a little cut for itself presumably for its part, to the backer as the payments came in.

If that includes a currency change then that would be understandable, especially considering the "issues" your country has had with currency valuation. I don't know enough about their (Paypal's) fee structure in other countries to comment on base fees, but in the US you'd be paying a few percent already unless you used a bank account to fund and sent the money friends and family, so saying that 5.4% is a lot may or may not have much basis.  
.  
Since you presumably aren't going to be keeping that much money in bitcoin to use for everyday expenses, do you honestly think you'll save that much by switching? Transmission is much cheaper, but you have a conversion in then a conversion out, plus you are still paying the same, if not a worse, rate if there is a currency conversion since that is built into the BTC price relative to that currency.

I hate to break it to you, but any organization that can't/refuses to articulate what it wants, why it wants it, and how (it intends) to achieve it, is by definition broken. They don't need a single demand; however, they do need an agenda, and a set of goals, if not an immediate way to work towards those goals.  
.  
The OWS movement staunchly refuses to set an even basic set of goals under the theory that they shouldn't be definable without realizing that not being definable also limits the conversation and the power for them to spread their "message." Without a coherent message they have only that one general line about being upset to spread, and that fizzles quickly.

Backing can have many meanings. If you mean by direct exchange then yes, backing hasn't been the appropriate time since August 15, 1971 (at least for the US dollar). You're kidding yourself, or purposefully taking a very myopic view, if you don't think that that trust is a big part of it. The basis for the viability of any currency is trust and the price, created as you said through supply and demand, is just a manifestation of that.  
.  
If the trust in bitcoin disappeared then everyone would sell and the price would tank, thus destroying it as a currency. If you don't believe me, look at the Venezuelan bolívar, nobody trusts it and as such it has very little support. There is a huge black market for dollars, many transactions have to either be done in dollars or are pegged to dollars because of the rapidly fluctuating price changes, and the government is pretty much powerless to change that (not for lack of trying) because there is no trust.

How are they not perpetual contracts? That's an honest question. You buy-in once, exchanging your cryptocurrency for ghs. Those ghs represent a share of processing power, or in effect a share of the block rewards that are achieved by the entire pool equal to your share of the processing power.  Here is Cex.io [saying]( that Ghs last perpetually.  
.  
As the processing power of the pool grows, each GHS share is going to pay out less and less, that is because it is a smaller percentage of the total pool. This only works as a business model if they are at least trying to increase the payout per share as well. They appear to have scrubbed it but at one point there was something on their site that described that in relation to the fact that they claim to be ever-growing the processing power of the pool.

I can expect them to be profitable over time, otherwise they should liquidate their assets, return a fair share back to the people who own the now non re-sellable options (and the latter point is only because being able to re-sell your options is an option, otherwise they Cex could keep it all), and admit that they ran the company into insolvency.  
.  
As I've said before, the only way that they are not a scam is if the overall trend is proft making, otherwise they are being scammy and dishonest with the people who own ghs.  
.  
As I said though, if they were smart about it, and IMO the only ethical, and beneficially to them, customer friendly approach, would be to have their fee high enough to cover the down times so that the fee would go up to, but never exceed the payout per share. At worst, that means they would lose a little bit on blocks that took a long time to solve, and if they're honest that wouldn't be an issue since their trend would still be positive. At best they'd have a long run of good blocks and they'd end up with more profits that they could take while stile maintaining a cushion for bad runs.
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:01:01
I wouldn't because I know enough to know that the difficulty of mining increases, and historically so has the number of miners competing for blocks, which means that a miner (as in the machine) only gets less and less effective.  
.  
The same can't be said for cloud mining. I realize that Cex has fixed costs, as well as the repeating costs that come with always having to buy new equipment. That being said though, if they are spending the fees keeping up, then the rewards should almost always, if not always, be enough to cover the costs plus their profit.  
.  
To be clear, I mean over time, not in the short term, which is why they should be able to afford keeping fees below, or when they're on a bad streak, at, the block reward, since over time they should still come out ahead. Again, that is presuming that they are buying new hardware, setting everything right, and doing everything they can to maximize block rewards for their users.  
.  
Edit: To add something another comment made me think of, if in the long term they are losing money on each block, then they are insolvent and they can only survive as a ponzi scheme or by skimming off what little money the do get while keeping their customers in the red. In either case, they wouldn't get away with it forever if that were/became the case.

Possibly, but again, if they aren't buying new hardware then what is the point of anyone new buying ghs? It doesn't seem like they differentiate one ghs from another, unless they are doing it behind everyone's backs, which is unlikely but not impossible. If that's true, then there's been pretty much no incentive for anyone to buy since the beginning since the payout per share would be decreasing. I don't have a chart for it on hand, but I don't think the payout per ghs has been decreasing though.

At a certain point these people have to tire of being wrong. Is someone keeping track of all of these predictions so on the day one year passes on each one the predictors can be called out on it?  
.  
It seems like these predictions picked up after the freefall from the peak price (about $1,300 USD) and are still going despite the fact that the price hasn't gotten back to anywhere near those levels. Also, the people supporting these theories have absolutely nothing, zero, to support the idea that the price should increase. Even if growth continues as it has with no further regulatory obstacles or MtGox-esque scandals, there is nothing to support the price increasing over 3x what it currently is within a year.

Except that this isn't buying a physical miner and your second point is based on the assumption that they are using the same hardware or never profitable enough to afford better hardware.  
.  
As someone else pointed out, if they had the capital for a large scale mining operation themselves then they wouldn't need to sell ghs. Hypothesize though that a group that wants to get into mining has enough money to start small. They could, in theory, start with a few machines and give up some of their initial profit by selling a portion of their profits. Obviously that puts them at a huge disadvantage to start but lets say they have enough startup capital from an investor to start out big. They could still want to expand which would take a lot of time, or they could sell shares to other people, at a markup, so that they could make a profit. To expand though they have to buy new hardware, which makes the "pool" of participants more money overall.  If they keep expanding and adding new hardware, by keeping their share of the profits high enough, then there is no inherent reason why they would have to be unprofitable.  
.  
The tl;dr version, a mining company doesn't have to be unprofitable if they keep their share of the profits high enough to keep buying new equipment while still making the owners money.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:42:44
No, because their share isn't coming from the user's share of each block, otherwise they wouldn't be taking more than the user's share of the block reward as a fee. The fee is entirely separate from the formula that determines how much a user gets per ghs. Here is [their page]( describing the maintenance fee.
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:50:26

While terrorism doesn't exist in a vacuum, the idea of saying that there is any one cause of terrorism that can be eliminated is fundamentally flawed.

Since pretty much all terrorism now is Muslim fundamentalist terrorism, what I'm saying is that pulling out of countries and not invading others isn't going to end the terrorism or terrorist ideology.

I would agree to that point if, and only if, their contracts were tied to specific minining equipment, which would mean that they'd be selling a number of contracts for different miners, or their contracts were time limited. They aren't doing that, they are selling perpetual contracts based on a share of total output. 
.  
I don't think you, and many other people here, really understand their business model because it keeps getting equated to traditional mining contracts, which are totally different except for the common result which is that the buyer has purchased output.

I tend to agree, but IMO it leads to a chicken and egg problem to a certain extent. A lot has been done without widespread adoption but there is a limit to development, which is inexorably linked to growth, without wider adoption.  
.  
That is partially because the incentive isn't there to begin with without growth, especially when certain types of businesses will have higher development and startup costs, and partially because in a field with limited demand, competition can stifle the growth and entry of companies into a saturated field. For example, without an increase in users, there is a limit to the number, and size, of exchanges that will be able to operate and make a profit.

As I said in another comment, unless they are insolvent then they should continue making a profit over time, even if the profit per block drops into the negative in the short term. I could be wrong but I've gone through their FAQ and guides at various times and they only posted their disclosure of negative gains after people started getting hit by them.  If I'm right about that, and there is no sure fire way to know if I am, then that is dishonest IMO.
.  
Again though, unless they are insolvent, they should either eat any loss beyond the block reward in the short term (as in, they shouldn't pay out if the block loses them money) but neither should they charge a fee. If they are charging a reasonable fee then they should still be making enough in the long term to make a profit. Charging users suggests that their fee is too low and/or they are not keeping competitive with the difficulty.

Except that they don't offer contracts in any regular sense of the word. They literally have one pseudo-currency that is exchangeable at a market set rate for cryptocurrency or dollars.

Then it is in effect a ponzi, just and in an indirect way with a sustainability mechanism, in some coins will continue to be mined. If they are not keeping up with new hardware then the output will continue to decrease steadily until it reaches zero.

It actually would be easy enough by using a database of approved addresses. Similar to how now, credit card transactions require a database lookup to confirm validity of the number/account and confirm the transaction. The sending address on bitcoin transactions could be confirmed as valid or invalid.   
For international transactions the hardware itself could have the option or require a prefix code that acts as a country code, pretty much telling the system which country's database to use. Presumably this would be done in a way that would only allow international transactions from approved/signatory countries' addresses that agree to standards and enforcement.  
Controlling transactions **to** countries that don't agree to this would be a different story though, but convenience, cost, and barriers to converting from the foreign fiat currency (bought with bitcoin) back to the digital primary currency would be a hurdle many if not most people would not have the motive to break, especially since it would add to the cost.

Other than the fact that this was, shadily IMO, not disclosed until recently when blocks taking &gt;2 hours become a common issue and people started complaining? As I said with my other comments, it is patently dishonest for them to have a system wherein eventually blocks will become more often than not unprofitable and then suck their clients dry when that happens.  
.  
I have been called out on the assumption that they'd actually try to keep up with the difficulty and competition increasing, I unfortunately haven't been able to find anything to back up that claim from their end, but them not buying new hardware strikes me as incomprehensible considering that it defeats the purpose of their business model. It makes it doubly dishonest IMO that they'd be selling a product that made sense to buy ~~originally~~ early, but only if you were able to sell before it then became profitable. I believe the term I've used, and the term I stand by, is insolvent. If they cannot profitably mine then they are insolvent and taking any btc balance in people's accounts, and/or putting people's accounts into the negative, effectively penalizing them if they sell their Ghs, is doubly so.  
.  
Also, as I have stated, if they are so confident that they can keep making a profit on the majority of blocks, and that unprofitable blocks are a short term and not sustained problem, then they should eat the costs out of their profits under the assumption that they will make back the cost and then some.  
.  
Every company has costs and, as you said, the costs don't change based on whether a block is profitable or not. That being said, the ethical method to charge costs then is to have their fee cover the costs per block, plus the overage for any block that costs more than it makes. In that way, if a block costs more than it makes (if it takes more than 2.5 hours to mine), then the users wouldn't see any profit but they wouldn't take a hit. That would be ethical and it would make better business sense than screwing over their customers.  I'm assuming you won't argue that this is bad business in that it is going after their own customers.

As much as the evangelists wish it wasn't so, odds are that whatever becomes the dominant payment platform is going to be, at least at first, a fiat based phone based system.    
.  
Japan has had that for some time, Africa and South America are getting in on it, and, somewhat late to the party IMO, now the U.S. has ApplePay.  
.  
At some point new companies and new technologies will both refine the process and create more competition. I am sure that Bitcoin, or its successor, will be among them. That being said, Bitcoin as a mobile payment platform has no chance until fiat systems have become widespread and supplanted the traditional cash/credit transaction process that exists today for most if not all transactions.

True, but if you exclude going through an intermediary like Gyft, which for most people would be just another barrier to adoption, most ordinary tasks that are done on a regular schedule frequently (it's arbitrary but let's just say once a week), can't be done or at least can't be done easily, with bitcoin at this point.

Because it fails at both if it tries to be two contradictory things. It is neither a viable hedge nor an investment vehicle nor a currency right now.

The same thing has been said for the last seven years, Bitcoin has definitely grown and been integrated into businesses since, thus why it rose from and has never gone back to $40/btc. There is definitely a limit to that growth though, barring wider adoption and integration into mainstream uses, something that has been generally lacking thus far and which is often actively derided as unnecessary and even counterproductive by the denizens of this sub.   
IMO, familiarity building is a red herring. It is an admission that Bitcoin is a very limited use vehicle and that it has never had, and arguably never will, have the momentum to grow beyond being a hyper-niche vehicle.

It does need the approval of the people who are supposed to be adopting it, and you're just going to get people into it who want it for political reasons or as speculation unless the price remains more steady than it has/is. In that way, it does need broad approval, because otherwise all you have is a modern version of [tulip mania](
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:29:25
Why? Unless there's some sort of widespread adoption surge, which is incredibly unlikely at this point, there is at best a hope for slow growth, but even that's relatively dim since it can only expand so far on individuals and minor businesses using it casually.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:39:53
And people here wonder why so many people are unwilling to hold bitcoin for any amount of time, even if they process it transactionally for a business or other use.   
Bitcoin **WILL NOT** be a viable currency for widespread use, until it is stable. Price fluctuations like this are bad for bitcoin. The price fluctuations and rises may make you people who just want to speculate happy, but if you care about actual growth, not just baseless speculative rises (like this recent bubble bitcoin is currently in) you'll want it to settle on a price and stay close to that price.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:32:24
At least manipulation is rational. The people driving the price increases, including plenty of people here, are entirely detached from rational economics (except the exchanges who are driven by rational self interest). I guess enough idiots can manipulate the price for awhile, but eventually it will come crashing back down because there has been no growth, no expansion, nothing at all to make 1 bitcoin more valuable than it was back when the market valued it at $250 per.

Just noting here that the last time it hit $1200+, it dropped back down to $300 or so. It's been holding higher up for awhile now, but there's no concrete reason to think this isn't just another bubble. Nothing has changed to support the higher price. As has always been the case with bitcoin, it's all just speculation.

All that proves is that people are irrational and a broken system can be propped up for some time by stupid and irrational people, see [tulip mania]( for comparison.

Yeah, good luck with that. There is absolutely nothing supporting the price increase up from its ~$300 per bitcoin resting spot. This is the last time it spiked up all over again. Unless there is actually some basis for the new higher price, it's just a bubble that's going to burst again and bring it back down to $250-$300 per btc.

In terms of capability to expand, not really. A relatively small number of online businesses and even fewer retail stores have adopted it, sure, and it's used for some person to person transactions, but it has by and large hit its limit as far as organic expansion goes.   
It needs something to push  it more towards mainstream expansion and, especially since even people here can't seem to agree on whether it is a currency or something else, it needs legitimacy it can't really get outside of being embraced by the same people derided here as being the traditional financial fat cats.

This article is full of half truths. A good example is the following:  


While that is true, it ignores the fact that a credit card or bank account is still needed for acquisition in all but one way (person to person) and there is a utility cost in the fact that it is another layer on top of **whatever** payment system is currently in use, which increases complexity and time cost, if not monetary cost.   
The article is also overly optimistic in the same way that articles that come out every few weeks, saying that the time is near for widespread adoption, keep being wrong. The use cases sure are there, but they don't overcome the very big and very real hurdles to adoption, mainly that unless you have a critical mass of people near you with it, it has the same requirements to acquire and sell as any other currency, and in many cases more. There's also the learning curve, which is a lot less steep than it was, but is still decently steep, especially for non-tech users.

Unless something has dramatically changed with Paypal since I last used it (which has admittedly been awhile), it's withdrawal times are somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-5 business days.

I don't think they can both survive competing against each other even with that and my money is on reddit surviving until something else comes along and replaces it.  
At some point reddit will probably be replaced by something else, but until then they have the head start, the user base, the operational foundation, and the advertising support to at least make some money, even if it doesn't cover all their expenses yet.

@_date: 2015-07-05 04:26:50
It's an interesting idea but I'm not sure what's in it for the API providers. Essentially it would require them all to provide APIs in the same format, otherwise it would be just wasteful to have a client parsing multiple formats.  
Not only would that require providers (more than likely exchanges) to work together to implement some sort of standard, they would have to pay for the storage and bandwidth, which wouldn't be trivial considering how often each client would probably be calling the API.

fuck...  That's all I can say. A 12gb+ blockchain (or whatever it is now) is not feasible for many if not most users, it just isn't. Even if all of the proposed updates to how downloading it works (most recent to oldest, pruning, etc...), it still less than feasible to ask every day users to download the blockchain.  
If the options are the blockchain, insecure SPV clients, or trusting third parties to hold your wallet (and therefore your bitcoins), then IMO there are no good options for immediate access wallets. I say immediate access because the best option for security is cold storage, but it's less than practical for actually using it often.

Is there some reason Indian consumers can't just use rupees to buy from Amazon?    
If not then it is the same issue with most attempts to bring Bitcoin to consumers, where is the added utility and does it outweigh the extra steps need for the vast majority of people (who aren't getting natively paid in Bitcoin) to get and use it.    
This is an issue that the evangelists seem to gloss over. Unless there is some added utility that is above and beyond the added process of getting and using it then Bitcoin will not be widely adopted at the consumer level. That extra work could be overcome if people were paid in Bitcoin, but in a catch 22, that won't wisely happen until Bitcoin is widely adopted.
@_date: 2016-09-01 03:33:45
Except that it doesn't have any unique utility right now except in some edge cases. In most cases, using dollars, euros, yen, etc... as a native currency is just as convenient if not more so before you even add the exchange component in. That might change it people were being widely paid and transacting in Bitcoin but except for foreign exchange and black market uses, changing to a foreign currency such as Bitcoin just adds an unnecessary step as most places accept the native currency of an area already.

Beyond what btcfun said in response to you about debit cards, you can also make sure that it is interest free short term debt with a credit card.  
Assuming you have enough money to make the purchase immediately with Bitcoin, there is nothing stopping you from setting aside the money that you spent on your card (you can even do that in a separate checking account) and then paying the balance off each month.   
Since most places don't give a cash discount, if you have a rewards card then you can count your rewards as if they were the equivalent to cash back comparable to a Bitcoin discount.

Since I know it's an area that interests you, what's your take on strong anonymity vis-a-vis spam prevention?  
It would seem that strong anonymity would allow miners to ignore transactions from specific addresses still, butwould defeat any other attempts at blocking out transactions that are perceived as "spam". In a system where addresses were more or less one time use and not readily connectable (which is what you'd really need for strong anonymity), blocking individual addresses wouldn't necessarily even be useful.

The "new system" requires transacting into bitcoins from fiat and short of a very unlikely, despite what some nutcase survivalists here might say, economic collapse that wipes out global fiat currencies, there is no conceivable use case that makes widespread adoption advantageous on a national, much less global scale.
Investment does not equal adoption IMO. My criteria for adoption is being able to exchange goods and/or services (labor) directly for bitcoins and being able to fully live your life, as you normally would including all expenditures, without converting to any other currencies. The exception would be traveling and extreme circumstances (like a currency collapse or invasion by a foreign power).  
I'm not sure what a more official definition would be but it's probably pretty close to that. I can't think of a single currency that hasn't met or doesn't meet that criteria and has been successful over time. The one caveat to the previous statement would be regional currencies but those have a separate factor (close geography) that make them viable.

You also run into the issue of how github (and apparently mobbr) measure a contribution. They only seem to be measuring "contributions" as commits. That means that only a small handful of people get credit, despite more people putting work into the project.

I don't know Ledger that well but I did some research on Trezor when it was mentioned in this sub a few months ago and I can't imagine it ever catching on for mainstream usage. I can see it being bought out and looted for tech (probably by an existing hardware company) that can make a product three or four iterations down the line that might be bought by more than übergeeks though.
As much as people poo poo them for supposed security reasons, everyone has a cell phone and that, not making people carrying around a separate device just for Bitcoin transactions (which already are harder to use than the separate device known as credit cards), will be the chance they have. I still hold to my cynicism that I don't see it happening, but that's just my take.  
A wallet on a card, as long as it can securely send and receive without compromising its security and privacy (still an issue with most wallets) could prove me wrong though.  
.  
Edit: To note my reason for cell phones, most of Asia and increasingly much of Africa use cell phone payments almost ubiquitously, this includes poor areas. Europe, Canada, and the U.S. seem to be somewhat behind the times but the market is already more there for cellphone payments than another payment device, even disregarding Apple Pay's existence entirely (whose potential long term impact is disputable).

When Satoshi starts buying new hard drives for everyone then this makes sense. Until then, I'm going to chalk this up to either being shortsighted or purposefully ignorant of how large the block chain would grow to be and its rate of growth.

Edit: Or maybe this is one of the increasingly large list of things that Satoshi expected the community to fix and we've failed him in that regard by not coming up with a faster/smaller/better way to ensure accountability of the block chain.

In the linked page there is a link right there (admittedly in small text at the bottom of the page) that says "other ways to give" and links to the page with all of the giving options. It's bad, but it isn't quite making you "dig into search engines to find the Bitcoin option."  
They really should do a better job of publicizing the other ways to give, not least of us giving the link to other ways to give more prominence, but promoting a handful of ways on one page and then listing them all on another makes sense. IMO, the better way to do it would be to place "other ways to give" prominently below the Paypal button.

In the early days of bitcoin I was wrong, very very wrong about it dropping back down (a mistake that in retrospect cost me at least several hundred thousand dollars in potentially realized gains). That being said, every time it has gone past $1200 it has settled back down and there is no reason to think that this is anything different.   
There is absolutely nothing to support the higher price point right now, no news, no new innovation or usage, so this is a pretty clear bubble.

The larger issue of fungibility aside, what the hell are they going to do with any stolen BTC that they find.

They should have to say what the overhead was on running the option, either as a percentage of the take or as an absolute dollar amount (but not both).  
The arguments saying that they should, much less have to, give out what the winning bid amount was is specious though. Unless this becomes a matter for appeal, there is no real public interest beyond pure curiosity for anyone knowing what the answer is and saying that there will be rampant corruption because of this is pure hyperbole.   
Unless you want to buy into some conspiracy theory that the government didn't actually auction off all of the coins, somehow doctored the record to say that they seized fewer coins than they did (before announcing) and then secretly sold the un-declared bitcoins on an exchange or to a private buyer, there is pretty much no way that corruption is a credible idea in this case.

Again, for an utterly ridiculously limited definition of ownership that makes no sense. Ownership is not the same as control.

For a narrow definition of own that no credible person in any field (academic or business, take your pick) would accede to.

If events so far are anything to go by, an increase in growth/value compensating for the lack of block rewards cannot be relied upon to make up for the current reward structure. It's arguable whether transaction fees will increase or how much since after a point they would be self defeating (so high that they actually discouraged on-chain transactions). That being said, transaction volume might very well increase more slowly as side chains take off and become more viable. I'm not holding my breath for more efficient mining equipment though.

I'm guessing that still requires giving a complete stranger your account number though. The advantage to centralized exchanges, is that they have a certain level of trustworthiness built in.  
.  
As I've said in previous comments, even MtGox wasn't stupid enough to raid people's bank accounts with the credentials they had. The same can't necessarily be said for the pseudo-anonymous person that you are either giving your credentials to for the purpose of sending them money directly or the middle-man.  
.  
The web of trust or rating system that the pursuers of decentralized exchanges want, to verify that the excrower is trustworthy and reliable, doesn't protect against that either since the credentials don't expire, at least not in any meaningful quantity at any meaningful rate (most people don't often close their checking accounts), so someone could build up a database of different account numbers for years before doing anything and most of them would still be valid.

The scarcity argument is why Bitcoin is fundamentally worthless and IMO will never be respected at the level that fiat currencies are. Fiat currencies rely on scarcity but only in relation to X, where X is any number of things (GDP, national wealth, national debt, the number of jelly beans in a jar, etc..) depending on who you ask.  
.  
Fiat currencies do not fail or weaken because of competition unless the basis for the local currency fails and a foreign currency takes it place (see any number of countries that now use the US dollar as a de facto currency). As many people here are admitting, that isn't true with Bitcoin.

The privacy issue is a huge one for me, unless you're whole life is tailored towards this one community and arguably looking trustworthy, although people who are trying to just cultivate an image should be watched out for, then that means creating a huge profile about yourself and publicly putting it out there. Some people may be fine with that, but it IMHO is irresponsible to encourage people to do that just to get a few extra internet points that are meaningless, see my next point for why.    
My second issue with linking identities is that people are trustworthy until they aren't. Read up on sociopathy and you'll see that a hallmark of sociopaths is fooling people into believing them and trusting them, thinking that sociopath has the victim's best interests at heart.  I'm not saying that every bitcoin scammer or thief has been a sociopath, but pretty much every one of the major ones had a huge social network and was trusted by thousands of people. That IMO makes the idea of using pre-existing reputation and relationships utterly useless.  
Something I don't see in the FAQ is anything about weighing recent reputation versus historical reputation. A good system should be weighted to give more value to recently built up reputation and reputation directly related to the transaction at hand (i.e. reputation from recently brokered transactions rather than purely relational reputation). I would strongly suggest implementing a system that decays reputation over time, either absolutely (maybe only a certain point so people don't lose all of their historical reputation) or at least relative to more recent reputation.  
.  
Edit: Making my sentences more clear, I used trust and reputation interchangeably which made it unclear, I have fixed my phrasing to use the word reputation, which is the term bitrated uses.

I remember working in a movie theater as a teenager, fun times. Was the one you worked at old enough to have the projection room designed for the old [nitrocellulose](  
.  
I remember where I worked (a circa 1920's-30's theater upgraded over the years), the room was designed so that in case of fire it became pretty much a bunker to slow the spread of the fire at least long enough so that people could get out before the rest of the building went up.  It had steel shutters and a fire wall between the projectors and the theater as well as an escape hatch with a ladder to the neighboring theater as a secondary exit.

Downvote me all you want, but if bitcoin is perceived as something that is only used by people who want to get rich quick and teenagers who want to risk their allowance money on the frantic ups and downs of the price of bitcoin in relationship to the dollar or the euro, then it will fail.  
.  
Admittedly I am, and always have been a bitcoin skeptic and believe that it will fail to be widely adopted anyway. It's more likely that it will survive on its own as a niche transaction method (and possibly as a distinct currency, but I doubt that will survive in the long term). Although it will almost certainly influence future developments in currency systems.  
.  
That being said, why do more to make it look less mature and well developed, and the same for the people who use it, then it already does. The people who really want bitcoin to fail entirely don't need the help but I'm sure they're happy to get it.
@_date: 2015-02-27 08:59:03
It really comes down to the fundamental problem with distributed exchanges, or any exchange really, which is that at the end of the day you have to trust someone. Traditional exchanges are more or less trustworthy with bank information because the consequences are bad if the owner/operator stole the information and went on a spree. Even scammiest exchanges (cough, MTGox) knew that so they never drained people's bank accounts without permission. IMO, that is an insurmountable hurdle for distributed exchanges which have no such deterrent and no real protection mechanisms if they stick to true decentralization.
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:37:44
This is inaccurate as you aren't including transaction fees. I guess that isn't a fee for transmitting "money" but since 99.999+% of the population uses what most people would consider "real money" (i.e. not bitcoin) for 99.999+% of their transactions, a fact that is very unlikely to change soon, it definitely should be included in any comparison.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:51:13
Not sure why you got downvoted for that, those are good points. That's a fair enough point about JPY but in terms of heavily traded (and easily traded in and out of) currencies, they're on the list which is what I was thinking.  In terms of bitcoin not being a commodity, it seems to  behave as both at times.
@_date: 2015-02-07 06:04:20
If the entire system collapses then whether you hold bitcoin or not isn't going to matter either because there more than likely be no power or at least no internet, and thus no way to transact or verify. I realize that there are a few offline methods and of course handheld electronic wallets and physical tokens, but not in widespread enough use to be anywhere near viable.  
.  
The only reason gold and silver work in a doomsday scenario is that you can transact them face to face in exchange to goods even when the world has gone to hell and if/when a recovery occurs, they'll be worth just as much if not more than they were worth before the crash.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:00:17
No, I've said to anyone who'll listen that IMO distributed exchanges are not viable because this hurdle can't be overcome unless the outside banking system changes, such as with the equivalent to temporary credit card numbers which some banks offer now but for checking accounts (not bloody likely), or an outside middle-man, defeating the entire purpose.  
.  
The only thing that might work is if a significant number of exchanges offered an API to in effect link into the distributed network, allowing the actual dollar side to go through the exchanges (they'd in effect act as the middle man and potentially an escrow).  
.  
This could be done in a similar way to a [TLS]( handshake, in that part of the transaction matchmaking could be that both parties have a published list of acceptable agents (exchanges), presumably ranked in order of preference, and only if there was a matching exchange, would the transfer go forward.  
.  
The downside would be that it would reduce transparency in the order book unless each person's book was filtered/filterable to only show orders that matched their list of acceptable agents (possible, but IMO not particularly ideal). Even then, it could cause some major issues with matching market orders.
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:01:54
Probably, because it has a number of advantages, but it sidesteps or defeats the transparency and a lot of the security that Bitcoin supposedly provides. If this became widespread it would weaken the arguments that the evangelists hold out as making Bitcoin better than other currencies.

Cars do almost everything in their power, short of refusing to function, to stop you though. There's no system to stop you from accelerating and steering into a tree (yet); however, there are seat belts, airbags, crush zones, and a roll cage to protect you and the only easily defeatable one of those is the seat belts.

The ones who do, in the vast majority of cases (just anecdotally), instantly convert it back to the local currency because the exchange rate changes way too much to the point of holding BTC required for operations (i.e. not outright profit) is totally non-feasible.

As already has been pointed out, the difference being that consumers don't lose a penny when banks get hacked, unlike when exchanges get hacked.  
.  
The USD's relative value isn't affected by hacks either, at least not noticeable, while historically the value of BTC, on top of its already unpredictable price swings, has had it's value relative to fiat currencies hurt by major hacks. I'd argue that will become, and already is becoming much less of an issue though as the exchange market broadens.

Not to mention make sure you get both the signature and the download from a secure (HTTPS) page to ensure that there hasn't been a man in the middle attack. If either of those are in the open then they can be tampered with to give a fake client or show a fake client as having a real signature.

I don't get how registration of miners would have ever been enforceable. They weren't going to stalk hardware buyers and mined coins could easily be tumbled before withdrawal or sold/used outside of an exchange or real life info requiring situation.
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:26:53
That's what I said, or at least meant. If the signature isn't on a secure page then it is vulnerable to a MITM attack. Only if both the signature and the download are acquired through unsecure channels can the file signature be faked (by altering the file and then giving the user a false signature that lines up with that file) but it's possible.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:33:45
It's because SHA based hashes or PGP hashing are the go-to replacements for MD5 which is now beyond broken and uselessly insecure. I don't entirely get the point of PGP hashing either since it's not as simple to verify as an SHA based hash but to each his or her own.
The good developers IMO hash with a number of different algorithms which makes more work for them each time they rebuild the download but is a lot more user friendly since it gives the user their choice to verify with.
Edit: I may be wrong but I also believe PGP offers a digital signing component but I could be wrong about that.

This is the Icelandic government covering their asses. They must know by now that they've blown it by keeping capital control in place for so long and that now that they've done so they can't very well get rid of them since the moment they do anyone who can will move their money out of the country.

Read what I said again. I don't like to sound defensive again but I said right there, that that's why both need to be secure. The signature can be forged if it is being hosted on an insecure page and if the download is also from an insecure page the signature from the fake file can be given to the user.
I realize that it would require a lot of stupidity to have a signed file only to keep the file and the signature on insecure pages but I'm sure it happens.

The signature is the result of a [hash function]( In essence, a hash function takes a series of bits and runs an algorithm on them that returns a key that corresponds exactly to that series of bits. That means that if the file is modified in any way the new signature won't line up with the old signature.
What you are doing by checking the signature of the file is running the hashing algorithm again on the file and comparing what you get with what the publisher of the file is saying you should get based on what they got after they last modified the file. 
Outside of a very low chance of what is called a [hash collision]( using a hash check ensures that nobody switched out the file unless they also modified the published signature.
