HSBC was fully aware of their hand-holding of Al qaeda, drug cartels, and others. Then they were caught and had to pay less money than they made helping them. No criminal charges.
That doesnt change their behavior. That makes sure they know it is fine to repeat &amp; they'll profit on illegal behavior.
Your premise is that they changed their ways because the fines worked. Laff.
Chump change is not a deterrent.

Awww, those poor poor trillion dollar terrorist-funding criminal bankers.
If they get punished for liability, they may only buy 99 solid gold castles instead of 100.
TLDR: Fuck banks

**Translation:** I see the tellers alot and they smile at me sometimes, but the actual bosses dont give a shit about me and would readily let me die for profit. But if I smile and ask politely, they may show some mercy in hope of profiting on me more later.

It means he thinks chase sucks, which made him close his account with them and then he opened another account with a different bank.

Are you ignorant or just naive?
HSBC funded Al Qaeda, Drug Cartels, and terrorists. Held their hand in the process. Their punishment was a fine less than their profit doing so.
If you werent stupid, you would realize that imprisonment after criminal charges &amp; jailing the leadership is the only thing that would stop them.
Amazing that you believe fining a criminal less than they profitted is a "mechanism put in place to make them stop".
Your current mechanism ENCOURAGES them to CONTINUE funding terrorists.
Then again if youre a US citizen, you probably are so ignorant you dont even know your own government directly and indirectly funds and arms the very terrorists they fight.
