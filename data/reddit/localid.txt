I do not think I'm above any rules or regulations. I did not demand a faster transaction. All I did was ask if there was a way to speed up the transaction. Very different.
I was not trying to pick a fight. Why would I pick a fight with someone I gave all my personal information to?
I don't know Seth and maybe he is the best customer service rep in the universe. In my interaction with him he came across as either very distracted or unconcerned with my question.

In which way exactly. You called me an asshole which can mean different things to different people. You have to be specific as to in what way you feel I was behaving with assholery.

I agree. That would have been an appropriate way for a customer service rep to respond if you felt that way.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:30:29
Because I asked if there was a faster way to complete the transaction?

Actually I don't get this all the time. People are usually really friendly, especially when money is involved.
I think it's presumptuous of you to conclude that I am an asshole based on how very little you know of me. You may believe I was acting like an asshole in this instance but that does not mean that someone is an asshole all the time.

How do you know his motives? Maybe he was tired or eating a sandwich. You have no way of knowing his motives unless you are him.
You are correct that in working in customer relations (which I do) you cannot predict how people will respond but that does not mean you drop your level of professionalism. It's similar to answering your phone at your company and saying "hello" like you were at your own home. You should be answering the phone with something like "Hello, thank you for calling ____, how can I assist you today?" You address everyone with professionalism initially and *then* modify.
Everyone on here so far has taken issue with what I posted and even though I didn't think I was rude at first after reading and rereading my post I could see how it appeared to others, and the rep. That I regret but all the name calling and accusations of being this and that person from one post has lead me to believe that you all have your own issues. Is it internet hate machine? Repressed anger at customers from your own job? Or could it be assholery on your part I am not sure.

The problem for me was the manner in which my question was addressed.
I did not say they were terrible. I said that I am unimpressed, big difference.
If you had stated something along the lines of: "Your wait time is customary for purchasing Bitcoin though our system. We outline all of these details in our service agreement" I wouldn't have been offended at all. That is factual. That is communication. Just saying 'Nope' with no follow up, no clarification is unprofessional.

This I found out after I registered with them and completed my transaction. As pointed out in my post I was trying to get into Bitcoin and I'm not used to waiting this much time after I buy a product.

I know what you meant. It's similar to when I fire a patient. You basically tell them you no longer want their business and refuse to serve them.

Thank you for stating that I was being an asshole. I don't agree with you but I like that you kept your statement specific to the action your referencing.
