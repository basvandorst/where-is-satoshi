that s so deeeeeeeeppp dudeee , i am also a bitcoin fan, but i must have critical thinking , if u just sit on your laptop and post comments like bitcoin won\`t fail or die or others meme text, the situation won\`t get better, the technology must be used by people that\`s the reason it has been build it. You  can\`t make mass adoption by saying bitcoin won\`t fail or die, you must integrate the technology in the real economy, if it is a technology that ensures medium of exchange it must be used like that, the economical environment must adopt it due to its advantages, not to decline it due to the lack of practicability .

of course they are, but there is production businesses. For a business that take commission about 1% let\`s say or 7-8% as for the ATMs is not the same. The fact that banks are closing all doors for bitcoin is  something that should concern all of us. They are not working in the interest of the citizen they are working only in their interest and by doing that they also point to the crypto market as being used only as black market . Mass adoption of bitcoin is directly related with the bound between public authorities and bitcoin.

because without any pump the attention disappear, and just the bitcoin club can\`t put pressure on the public authorities, for example in my country everyone bought and sell bitcoin when the price was ATH , they all want it and the authorities didn\`t have the power to shut it down, like they are doing  now. In Romania after ATH , at about 3 months distance , all the banks and now i am referring to all , closed the accounts for the bitcoin businesses. Basically there are few companies that still dealing with bitcoin and most probably they are having hard time with their banks . The reality is that in this conditions, imposed by the authorities only the black market can function with bitcoin (and this is a good thing for them ). the truth is that we need a high price, cuz the technology does not attract people like the potential of getting rich .

The truth is that no one from this market can guarantee u �� safety! The only thing that might give u safe exchange is paradoxically F2F exchange.  The banks can shut down ur account, the exchange can fuck u with their kyc.... Fiat to crypto became a big headache, and with the amld5 the things will be worst (amld5 is just in European Union).
