Im using a adhesive water soluble fleece stabilizer ontop of the fabric. It really helps to improve the quality.

This was just for fun. I am not selling crypto logos. But what i do is embroidery for customers. They usually want monograms, names or some logos. Most of the time customers bring towels they want embroidered.

A laser cutter is great too! Unfortunately it's pretty strictly regulated in germany.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:34:15
I did it in 5 minutes.
Edit: as long as it's not for a customer i am not going to "waste" time for such little side projects.

Then he did something wrong, usually stabilizers like fleece are used to prevent the embroidery to change its size or shape.
I am using a stabilizer under and ontop the fabric for a better result and quality.
I didnt used a stabilizer ontop for this one because it was a piece of unused cloth.

I can just tell you that i paid 3,5k€ for this Brother VR and 2k€ for the embroidery software from brother.

It can go faster but i reduced the speed because the under thread is made from polyester and sometimes it gets ripped apart.

Not sure about that.

Yep, I stretch that shit like a madmen. Otherwise as you said it wrinkles and sucks.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:36:38
Why is it low quality?

All these puns, it's unbelieveable ��

You need a program where you can digitize your logo for the machine to read. I am using PE-Design from brother for this task. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:41:25
Yeah kind of looks like that �� but its actually to support the stitched thread. You can say it creates a foundation first and stitches ontop of it.

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:07:47
At work, yes.

I can, but you'd need to wait till monday because it's on my work computer.

@_date: 2018-03-17 19:32:36
Yeah! Everytime I catch myself watching the stitching process for too long because it's just so fascinating. I just wish the machine wouldn't be so loud.
