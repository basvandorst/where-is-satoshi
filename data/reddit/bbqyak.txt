Hate to hear this. 
For Canadians, what would you guys recommend for cashing out - Quadriga or Kraken?
This is making me consider Quadriga instead. 
I wish there were more options as a Canadian. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:27:18
Now time to add Canadian banks :(

As a big basketball fan this is pretty cool to see.

I hate Kanye but he's right. This coin is obviously a pump and dump joke anyways. It does nothing for the future of crypto currency.

Security is a big issue. It's pretty complicated and overwhelming for the average person. Even after they learn it's still stressful worrying about 2FA, mobile security and computer security. If someone steals your credit card information it is amazingly not that difficult to get the charges reversed. My mom has done it many times. 
People keep saying Trezor will change that but I guess we will have to wait and see. Assuming the technology of Trezor works like it's supposed to, the price will be the next big factor. The average Joe who buys a few bits of a coin won't want to enter the game if the Trezor costs as much as their BTC did.
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:59:25
Man we need Trezor badly!

What an idiot he should have paid. He could have easily put that on HIMSELF and gotten the money twice. While unlikely, it's not out of the question. What a terrible manager. I suggest you leave a bad review if possible even though Yelp is most likely to flag it for "spam".

As a frequent visitor for almost 7 years, this is indeed pretty big news. I mean it's not necessarily a game changer like for example Amazon would be, but the fact that they are even on board with it shows how far we have gone. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:11:09
45? Nice, finally a decent amount will be coming!
But I thought Taiwan "stopped" the ATM from coming?

This isn't even funny, which hopefully, was your intention.

Dumbfounded as to why Amazon seems so against Bitcoin. Not even "watching" or something but absolutely no interest to implementing it.

my grandma used to send cash in envelopes to relatives in the Philippines, one day she might use bitcoin :). Probably not since there were much easier, more practical and safer ways than cash in an envelope lol but she still didnt catch on

How on earth can you say it's "likely"?
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:51:59
Same. Even though I knew it was cheap at 200, I wasn't willing to risk anymore especially after the price hadn't returned to my break even point after a long time. Just wasn't worth the headache, it already took me a while to detach myself from the money I initially put in. Now I have no attachment to it. I treat that money as if I didn't even own it anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:18:17

I'm trying to load a hot wallet every week to buy food with bitcoin. My only worry is that I'll end up going out of my way to buy things I wouldn't have.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:10:41
This is pretty cool. Would definitely like to visit Cyprus one day. Not to use bitcoin or anything but just because they seem pretty forward thinking as far as I know.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:46:05
Yeah I think using is just as important. And if you don't actually want to use your BTC, if you're ever at a place you know DOES NOT accept BTC, you should ask them if they do. That may plant a seed for the future, who knows. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:44:24
haha wow lucky man
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:50:34
That's pretty poor logic

a "hunch" isn't nearly good enough.

lmao the acting was so cheesy
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:42:21
So a communist country tries to regulate the fuck out of Bitcoin? Well, good luck doing the same around the world now especially after the media coverage this will get. If people understand what Bitcoin is they would not like their own country "banning" it as it will show their true colors. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:26:24
If we're going to draw positives from a negative another thing to look at is the fact that China had clamped down on Bitcoin means it IS a legit currency/commodity, it is no joke. Also the fact that a COMMUNIST country clamped down on it means that the general public's opinion on it cannot necessarily be negative as if it were Switzerland or Canada saying we don't want our people using Bitcoin. If North Korea banned it next I don't think people would think it was bad either. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:07:26

Shame he passed away in 2006 and never got to see his prediction actually happen and become big :(
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:32:04
Who was that guy who said nobody will take bitcoin seriously or something until countries start banning it? Well its happenening. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:44:50
Good luck, your website looks pretty nice so far!
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:21:20
Bitcoin truly is revolutionary and whether or not THIS is the actual medium of the future, I hope those of you that believed in it from long before and didn't cash out quickly are rewarded. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:29:50
I'm surprised there aren't more ATMs yet... Probably due to very complicated legal issues but I hope they come soon. We need these around the world faster!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:18:53
yup Virtual boy was a bad example... nintendo didnt even back virtual boy. they discontinued it ASAP.
not to mention the sales were terrible so I don't think you can even compare it to that since bitcoin has made a huge splash worldwide. if you're going to negatively compare bitcoin to anything you should compare it to a "fad" or something that got axed quick like napster (once again maybe not the best example but im not going to spend all day thinking of one that matches perfectly). 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:00:40
Can we stop saying "virtual"? My money "in" the bank is more "virtual" than bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:25:12
Truthfully you should have gone droid regardless.
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:19:04
Yeah it "was" $100... Your OP clearly says "I know TREZOR cost 100$ right now". So you're wrong twice. 
1) It's not $100, it "was" and the last price it sold at was far more than $100. That's not to say it won't be $100 in the future but it's not now, nor was it for a long time.
2) It's not even for sale. 
So OP is tripping.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:32:28
Much respect. I consider myself to be a fairly moral person but you just made me feel ashamed of myself. I imagined myself in your position and I don't think I would have returned it. But every time I see a good act like this it reminds me why I should. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:59:35
There's been a plethora of consistent good news even with the China thing. I don't see why everyone is so surprised by a tiny push. I'm surprised it's taking this long.

It may help influence a minority of people if we all vote "buy", however I'm interested in seeing the results without a bunch of redditors spamming buy.
With that being said its too late just vote buy :)

why do americans have asian words tattooed on them? 
people find other cultures exotic and english is pretty much the global secondary language. foreigners love learning it especially for its uses in business. 
anyways what I found super interesting was the way they spoke, mostly the lady. most words there was no accent (maybe even for all of them) but she did pronounce a lot of words unusually fast making it hard to understand.
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:36:41
Yeah so weird. Why can't they be normal like Americans and worship the all mighty Lord Jesus who died on the cross for our sins. Tiny subcultures in Japan have made some things the world has never seen before but if you ask me, having 76% (as of 2008) of your country still believe that some dude brought 1 of every fucking animal on a giant ship and survived a flood and storm large enough to destroy the rest of the earth, that's crazy. 
Japan is just more accepting of humankind's future. You don't think a lot of people don't secretly desire some of the "weird" shit Japanese people have thought of? Again, what's really weird is not some "love hotel" (which by the way many men would want to go to), but having 3/4 of your country of  300 million think that a fucking cracker crumb and some wine is the blood and flesh of this dude Jesus who died 2000 years ago.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:20:42

I'm pretty interested as to what the next generation of 1%ers or upper middle class will look like if Bitcoin starts following its true potential. This is very exciting stuff! Admittedly I've never been so excited about world matters and economics before.

@_date: 2013-12-20 18:01:36
Because they're a business operated in China? Why don't American exchanges translate to Spanish? Use your brain. Why don't YOU hire a competent translator or learn the language yourself if you're so interested in what it has to say?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:58:58
Bitcoin has made me greedy but it has opened my eyes to the wealth disparity in the world. Throughout occupy I was a supporter of just working hard but now I realize how messed the "system" really is. Hard work will still and should go a long ways, but there is clearly too big of a disparity between rich and poor. It's disgusting. I realize those businessmen have worked hard don't get me wrong, I want to go into business myself but why should so many people have to slave away in a "1st world" country where technology has been pushed for so many years to make things simpler? I just want what I feel I "should" have in a more utopian world.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:20:32
This has happened to me before... I was unaware I didn't have enough money. What boggles my mind is how the hell was I able to take money out of my bank account that I didn't have? Banks gonna bank.

Don't really know what NFC is but if it's "tap to pay" it was awesome when I was in China using the subway. Where I live right now is about 20 years in the past (or 100 years in the future depending on your hope in mankind) and they just "trust" that you paid when you walk on.

Can anyone give some tips on phone security? There doesn't seem to be any robust anti-virus apps for your phone... Considering how much personal data they use it's kind of unusual. 
I'm using AVG but I've always wondered if it even helped.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:02:30
exactly. 57% is dam good imo... everyone keeps saying bitcoin is in it's infancy well 57% is pretty good for infancy. remember: people don't like change. they've been using credit cards and paypal for years. despite their flaws most people would just rather keep using them because 99% of people have not been fucked over bad enough by paypal for example to want to stop.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:21:52
