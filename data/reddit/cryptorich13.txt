School isn't for smart people anyways. You're doing yourself a favor, OP. In a few years you will be laughing. HODL
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:06:41
It's not though. It's just what I'm doing with my portfolio 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:13:23
That's jargon to me. What's that mean 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:12:00
Just another day in cryptoland. You'll grow numb to it after a while.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:38:54
I've been thinking of this post all day. Thanks for the repost
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:56:53
I am not trying to troll. I just sodl my last btc and feel sad about it but excited for the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:19:29
The Monero gui is literally as easy and safe as a nano
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:51:07
When it has serious scaling problems, wastes energy through POW, and other coins exist that are instant and zero tx fees, I think you might. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:48:27
A lot.

@_date: 2018-01-19 01:42:53
Thank you bae ��
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:15:37
Competition coins?
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:49:52
Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:55:26
I'm not trolling. This is not to spread fud. I was a bitcoin maximalist up until mid November 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:26:17
I've heard zero stories like that and have stored over 100 coins on it at once with no issues 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:54:01
I've tripled my BTC value by getting out of BTC. If I ever wanted to buy back in, I'd definitely earn my place in the 1 million club
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:30:06
Those are rookie numbers.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:58:24
No, the meme from the movie is Felicia haha. And nah I'm white.

3 months 28 days thank you very much

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:46:27
This is most likely what I'm going to do, but the moment crypto hit the "is this fucking real" amount of growth... I've lost interest in working lol.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:20:41
I noticed you started posting in crypto subs about two weeks ago, near the peak. If that's when you started buying in, You have much to learn. When I bought in, I watched my investment drop 40 percent overnight. My finger hovered over the sell button, but I listened to r/bitcoin and bought instead of sold.  Now I have more money than I know what to do with. HODL, my friend. 
Also, if you think coordinated sell walls are a new thing, you're gravely mistaken. Whales have always manipulated the market. It's nothing new.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:29
Hell yeah man really regretting buying the peak
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:55:56
We can't buy more hamburgers, guns, fireworks, or beer until we break the 10k euro sell wall so they might as well just stop selling now because America is the only country that matters, duh.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:33:50
I am literally the only person at my work who has the ability to do what I do. They would be forced to hire someone else
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:12:54
Yeah I am about to quit my job. I have an engineering degree but had bills to pay so took a non engineering job. I have enough money in the bank to last a year and enough crypto to last many years. I walked out of work today. I'm not sure if I'm going back in tomorrow. I need to apply to real positions or just follow my dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:51:38

Ill be 30 in a few years. I'm hoping the same.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:07:28
Yeah because you can trade BTC for Ark on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:19
What do you mean
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:16:47
I've been locked out of my account with thousands on it for 2 weeks. Have fun. Ive lost thousands too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:35:44
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:01:19
I got lucky on some trading and drastically increased my position. Also got into alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:04:19
Ok redditor for 1 week
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:28:57
This is almost all profit for me so I'd be right where I started. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:58:38
No, I appreciate it all. Things are just looking kind of parabolic on a log scale and I could at least pay off my credit card that I used to buy Bitcoin with back in August
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:52:56
Zoom the fuck out
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:28:04
Thanks to everyone who upvoted. Bittrex allowed me back into my account and I know it was directly related to this post. I hope others locked out get access to their funds soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:03:16
Holy fuck
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:59:35
I never said liberal arts students were fucking idiots. I just know more engineers and comp sci majors with bitcoin than sociology or theater majors. Oh, they also have more jobs too 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:02:04
You, sir have won the internet today 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:25:06
Nice joke haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:00:32
A lot more than 4 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:33:01
Does it really matter though. I could say I owned .1, 1, or 1000 btc and would it really make a difference 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:04:32
I also bought in at 3k. Dumped my life savings into it along with buying 1.5 on credit card. I now have more money than I ever have. 
I also have more anxiety, fear, irrational thinking, obsessive behavior than I ever have.
I could see this shit having serious negative impacts on my life.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:39:33
Yes, people ignorant to crypto will think this but I've just been randomly messaging my friends throughout the years that I considered smart and asked of they owned BTC. Most do. These are people I haven't spoken with in years.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:46:06
Seriously, congrats!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:06
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:34:11
And they didn't pay anyone for Thanksgiving so fuck em
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:04:20
Definitely not lying. I want my money back bad!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:14:17
I did this and still zero response.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:52:48
I did the same thing about 4 months ago
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:54:46
Absolutely. I want a way to safely store some Monero and miota on a hardware wallet. Trezor not supporting them are the only reason I don't own them
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:11:20
Holy cow. For real?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:16:42
I'm hesitant to cause it could cost me a lot later on down the road but it could be the smart decision for now 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:08:51
I was just kidding man. And yes, it does go down. I watched my initial investment plummet 40 percent. It's all a part of the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:33:04
I hope so too man
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:23
My ex wife refused to let me invest in Bitcoin . I can't wait to see her face when I take he to court for custody and I reveal I'm a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:51:02
I learned about Bitcoin because of drugs too.. So......
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:32:54
Actually, I need help at work and when the other guy quit they realized I was able do the work of both of us and they only have to pay one person  so fuck em 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:18
Personally, I think it's gonna get the shit shorted out of it
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:56:51
Yeah, which is why we are into crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:24:50
Then why the fuck is there all this tether FUD? All these "newly printed tethers" supposedly causing the price to go up. Doesn't make sense when it's such a small percentage 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:26:14
It's refreshing to know that BTC could crash as hard as 2013 And I'd still be profitable. Fuck yes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:13:44
Dude. I wasn't leaving it on an exchange. I was trading BTC for alts to diversify and when I tried to withdraw they locked my account. I keep 95 percent on my trezor at all times. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:31:24
You're thinking of bitfinex
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:29
Nah I just remembered your comment 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:39:51
fuck these fees .man
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:56
My mom was telling me to do that today and I feel like I'd regret it. I have credit cards for events like that - like a part of me wants to just live like this never happened.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:41
I know... I posted about that on Reddit earlier today lol 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:31:19
I was enhanced verified 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:48:27
I use a trezor. I was doing a little alt trading.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:52:13
Yeah. I was already enhance verified and I accidentally re-uploaded the same documents.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:15:11
I cashed out about 22k over the past 2 weeks with Coinbase. Each withdrawal hit my bank the same or the next day with the exception of holidays and weekends. After yesterday, my initial investment is out and I'm playing with only profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:58:04
I was doing a little trading only for a few moments and they disabled my account when I tried to withdraw
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:12:57
Sorry I'm just frustrated. I explained what I was doing in the comments.  Most of the responses have been "not your keys not your coins" or "you're dumb for not using a wallet". I wanted to diversify into a few alts when BTC had amazing gains about a month ago and the only way to do that is to use exchanged like bittrex and binance. However, it really fucked me in the long run. I have 95 percent of my holdings on my trezor but sometimes you have to use exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:39:26

I started investing after the divorce. She is gonna shit herself. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:45:38
Youre right. I'm a troll because I state that BTC has increased in value consistently since its creation.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:35:55
No, what I implied is that past performance is a pretty good indicator of future performance
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:08:48
Youre right. Youre odds making money on powerball are greater. Bitcoin has consistently gone down in value over time.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:45:01
Ok I'll look into that stuff
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:06:08
Ah. Im buying a trezor this weekend so I was curious
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:40:07
Thats actually really cool
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:51:10
Ok I'll look into it this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:33:13
How many can one hold?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:05:27
I have earned more with bitcoin this year than my job. Let's all retire young!
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:37:36
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:07:24
I'm only asking cause I just dropped over 12k on bitcoin over the last few weeks and want my coins protected.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:05:10
Nah, its the amount of inches I gave your mother. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:48:58
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:46:14
Im a little confused on how to add / send bitcoin from a hardware wallet like that,
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:52:31
I mean, honestly.... It dropped to 3700 after I bought at 4300 and I felt nothing. Im just excited to be profitting.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:38:11
Feels good man
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:31:33
Except past performance.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:50:35
Out of curiosity, why do you need more than one?
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:00:27
Here we gooooo
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:00:10
Its gone up since day 1
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:40:58
Is this a realistic fear? This doesn't seem any more likely than your bank blocking your account?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:35:00
Actually looks like its good to go
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:55:21
I was mistaken. Looks like it WILL be good to go lol
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:13:30
Because I could either pay 2.5x price on amazon or wait a month for it to ship from factory
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:50:35
But bitcoin cash is an altcoin. I like BTC
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:48:53
Ah, I see. So small transactions occur similar fees. See, I didnt realize that. So, stuff like coffee and dinner dont make sense with BTC yet?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:57:26
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:21:54
You're right. A retarded 10 year old has discussion skills on par with (or perhaps better) than mine.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:57:14
*update*: the transaction also took a staggering 19 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:04:43
Wish I owned it, but I'm not an idiot so I dont.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:46:43
Im pretty sure I read that they don't back it at all.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:36:55
Best advice
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:06:16
I was in a similar situation. I had $33,000 saved up. Just bought a house and habe a great job. My ex wife dissuaded me in the past from BTC so I decided to take the leap. I bought 3 at an average price of 3600. My only regret so far is not buying a fourth. It's addictive, though. I made more money with BTC last week than my job. I've budgeted about 500 a month to put into bitcoin. Still strongly debating buying 0.5-1 more.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:23:47
Clearly you know best
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:16:40
They are working on it
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:58:11
I havent lost a dime on BTC
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:57:29
People have to be lying when they say 24-48 hours no confirmations. I got 9 confirmations within 1 hour. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:32:54
How will my holdings be converted into shitcoins? Wont it just provide me additional coins?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:08:33
I agree
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:26:29
We all are hoping.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:32:58
Buy directly from exchange, send to hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:42:13
Ok. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:56:46
Thank you. I'm convinced now.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:01:15
Im taking my ex wife to court soon and financial statements were necessary. There was nowhere in the 10 page document that asked about cryptocurrency. Only bank accounts, real estate, etc. You honestly gave the best advice you could. Its worked perfectly for me.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:08:56
Thanks. Didnt realize it had a sub
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:56:37
I agree. I still cant stop checking price. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:06:44
Is it a good idea to put your 24 words in a safety deposit box?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:06:26
I dropped 12k on bitcoin 2 weeks ago for the first time in my life. Dont regret it. In fact, my only regret was using coinbase and the price increasing quicker than my limits refreshed. Buying a trezor this weekend.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:28:52
Are we hoping all?
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:41:23
Also your coins are supposedly insured from their end.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:17:17
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:57:19
If you're a gambling man, I'll bet you all your bitcoin it won't hit 200 tomorrow. Not only not likely, but impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:52:33
This is so true. My buddy, a nuclear engineer, couldnt even get coinbase to work for him. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:42:53
So just set one in a safety deposit box? I'm trying to understand. How do you add bitcoin as you buy it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:10:37
I was tempted to buy a ticket tonight, but the odds are so against you. Bitcoin will always pay out. I havent bought a single ticket since I bought my first bitcoin. Its liberating, because you will get rich with bitcoin lifetimes before you will ever hit the lotto.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:49:53
We can only hope.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:12:35
It's math dude. 
Edit: All I'm saying is that if current growth is sustained, it will happen. Can we agree that 1000 percent growth over another year if we end at 10k in dec is 100k?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:09:24
They aren't yet
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:48:12

@_date: 2017-11-01 17:27:26
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:51:31
That's what I was talking about mainly 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:20:06
I have recurring buys and I send and receive money from my circle of friends that use Bitcoin. I also send Bitcoin to and from exchanges regularly, as I do some alt trading with a very small portion of my hodlings.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:14:12
Magnets. How do they work?
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:45:19
It went down 400 after doubling in a month. Are you kidding me? Sorry you bought st the peak. It is still up some absurd amount over the past month and 4k was an all time high just days ago.  In my state, to win the $250,000 scratch ticket it would take an average of 600 something years buying 1 ticket a day and having spent millions. If you are consistently profiting on scratchers, good for you,
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:59:17
You nailed it on the head.

@_date: 2017-11-26 03:34:43
I could put in a sell order at 9k, expecting to buy in lower,  that way it'll blast through all the way to 9500 and stay there. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:19:33

It hasn't failed me yet. I went 110 percent all in earlier this year . What's life without a little risk
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:03:09
Just wait until BTC is 110 percent of your net worth. That's when the real run begins.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:21:40

Because I exchange all my Fiat for BTC so I'd have to spend it anyways.

A relative of mine passed and I received a quarter of his life insurance policy. I put a quarter of what I received into Bitcoin about a year after I received it. Had I gone all in when I first received it, Id be a millionaire now. Keep that in mind. I've made great returns, but if I were in your shoes I would, without hesitation, go 100 percent all in. I am potentially getting a workman's comp settlement soon. Guess what? 100 percent all in. I'm a risk taker willing to lose it all. I believe in the tech and think it will change the world. Just ask yourself if you've been able to live without that money. If the answer is yes, then you know what you should do. Would you rather spend that money in an investment that could change your life in a few years and fail knowing you invested in something amazing, or keep the 50k and watch the crypto market cap reach trillions? 50k will not change your life. You will be a wage slave the rest of your life with or without 50k. Millions from hodling - now that is life-changing

The most ironic thing just happened. My girlfriend just came over. She put on Keeping up with the Kardashians. I have never seen her watch this show. It immediately made me think of your comment. I asked her about them and she rattled off the whole family tree and about who is in and out of rehab and who is maybe pregnant and blah blah blah all while keeping my attention focused and acting interested. This is how you relationship. Maybe she'll listen to me and act interested when Bitcoin hits 10k here soon.

Slightly. She has asked me to stop talking about it all the time. I must admit, I've been a little obsessive, but I've also made half a years pay in 1 month so I think it's OK to be excited. I have to work on not talking about Bitcoin every day.

It pisses me off too how quickly species are dying off, but me not throwing money into Bitcoin and staying poor isn't going to save them. There needs to be universal change for the better and I think Bitcoin is the beginning of positive changes in the world.

Seriously sorry for being rude. I'mma edit the main post.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:47:49
I'm not sure, but right now I know that because of BTC I could pay off all my credit cards and student loans and have plenty left over. If BTC dropped to zero tomorrow, I'd be like every other american. Credit card debt, student loan debt, wage slave the rest of my life. The money I invested isn't life-changing what is life-changing is the possibility that Bitcoin will be worth millions. That's why I was willing to risk it all. Fuck debt, fuck inflating currency, fuck 0.5 percent interest savings accounts. It's time to stop trading our fucking time for money that is worth less and less every single day to keep us in debt and working until we are 65. We have one fucking life. it's time to live. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:52:58
There's no hope. If current growth is sustained for 2 years, it WILL happen. If growth slows or there is a major crash or death spiral, it won't. 1000 percent increase over next 2 years is a 100k BTC in 2018 and 1M in 2019, but growth has to be sustained.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:09:17
Exactly this
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:56:19
And to say that I don't value money is absurd. I am vet, served 4 years and raised a family. I have been a debt / wage slave my whole life. it was an absolute gamble the day I dumped my entire savings into Bitcoin, but it has paid off so far. I'd say it's better than a las Vegas tier gamble, given that everyone who has held Bitcoin long enough is now rich. So ya know, it was an educated gamble.

You sound like the type of person who calls the water vapor coming out of the nuclear plant steam towers "pollution". If you're worried about pollution, don't come after Bitcoin. The Pacific ocean's plastic count was high before Bitcoin ever became a thing. You think Bitcoin is causing the pollution? We were fucking up the Earth long before Bitcoin came around, with plain old fiat and corporate greed.

@_date: 2017-11-23 00:26:34
Not at all. I am buying items with money that would have been stuck in FIAT. Example: $1500 biweekly paycheck post taxes. You're not going to spend that all at once, but most of it needs to be uses for bills, food, toiletries. Exchange most of your paycheck for BTC. As you buy things throughout the week, the remainder of the BTC that would have normally been fiat rises in value. 
What I am saying is this money would have NOT been used as holdings to begin with. Do you understand now?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:00:01
Sure do, lol. Stingrays.

@_date: 2017-11-01 02:45:31
I agree, but the counter argument could be that if someone could hodl for long enough to afford a yacht, they probably will be wary enough not to blow their savings, since they had the patience to wait that long to begin with.

You don't agree that 1000 percent per year, if we end at 10k this year will make a six figure Bitcoin in 2018? Did you not learn elementary / middle school level math? Not trying to be rude, but I made very clear that I am saying that IF current growth is sustained, this will be the outcome. I'm not saying it will happen , but at current growth rate it will. Where is the confusion?

Like OSTK CEO said "it's not about how high BTC can go, it's about how low fiat can go". If it hits $1M in 2019, there's a good chance fiat will be worth a lot less. I just paid $2.39 for a slim Jim and $2.09 for a 20 oz soda for fuck's sake.

Yes. Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin (BCH) have two different blockchains.

The reason this mentality is wrong is that when it goes up, you can continue to buy and make money. When it goes down, you lose money but can increase your position more. You still lose money. I'd rather it continue to rise, everyone make money, and buy as we head to the moon.

No shit? I'm an idiot then,

I spent a little time on the USS Virginia there. Hopefully some lucky sailor hit it big.

I just bought half a bitcoin with cc. Still have $22,000 in credit limit. So tempting.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:45:00
Taxes, how do they work?
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:51:24
Damn. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:53:07
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:12:02
I need at least 2 zeroes. Next year pls.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:18:46
I have a txid. It says no transactions detected.

The point of this post was to show dollar cost averaging. I've bought roughly 34k in BTC, traded a portion of my portfolio, and wound up with over a quarter million USD at the beginning of the year. The point was to show newbies that it's OK if you buy high because you also needed to buy low, but you had to go try and be smart adding up the numbers. These are only a VERY small fraction of my buys.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:53:32
Its supposed to say come on... Bahahaha
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:37:26
They probably didn't like seeing my enormous savings account slowly dwindle down due to coinbase over 6 months. I legit called yesterday cause I lost my wallet and the lady in the credit department was like ... Uhhh... Was your last charge coinbase for $2000? Damn straight it was. I bought from NFCU using credit a few days ago so this must be brand new.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:32:15
I went all in around 3700 and this shit is bumming me out.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:46:15
So you get both coins but cant sell both coins? What?
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:41:36
... Aaaand its dropping again
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:32:55
Oh, BCC = bitconnect. I thought he was referring to BCH
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:29:14
Same here. But how is shift making money?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:34:18
So am I and have even offerred a 5% discount if they pay in crypto. None of my tenants have bitten yet.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:20:25
Can you give me a tl;dr
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:23:07
You only trade with a portion of your portfolio, say 50-20 percent depending on your level of risk. I went for 50 but your average investor should probably do 25 or less
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:41:41
$4750. My condolences to the sellers.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:15:49
Blows my mind you can pay for a nice lunch with 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:26:13
This still isnt making 100% sense. If I buy a cup of coffee, can the seller see how much BTC is in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:23:04
Still hodling my btc
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:23:29
All it says is that *for now* 0 conversion fees, 0 tx fees
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:13
I wish I would have sold but still hodling. I actually bought ,25 more just now.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:16:37
How long have you been in BTC? The last week is nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:55:32
No issues
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:12:02
You just provided ideas I'd never even thought of. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:31:25
If we all get rich, I don't care what the fuck you call it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:56:27
You spelled $1,000,000 wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:16:19
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:22:35
Mine was too.
Edit: it was the best decision of my life. Steroids introduced me to BTC and after a few months of realizing that my steroids later cost me thousands, I bought in and have made tens of thousands.
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:17:08
I can't find the rate at the exact time I purchased the coffee, but I went to a pharmacy afterward and the cost in BTC was the exact exchange rate at the time of purchase
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:58:41
Bitcoin does go down sometimes lol. I figure I'll convert a set amount of fiat at the beginning of the week that would be used for essentials and just buy with BTC to stimulate the economy. Others should follow in suit.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:01:59
Same. I still buy the dip. Bahaha. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:43:36
110% of mine is
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:11:00
Is that why sell walls pop up at certain levels then disappear?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:45:11
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:38:24
I definitely will.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:16:05
Easy: dont buy a yacht
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:03:19
What is Bcash. I was buying bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:40:09
I hardly check FB anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:16:05
This is insane. I'm still dreaming of the day that I roll up to pick up my son in my Lambo bought with the Bitcoin my ex wife has no clue I own. There was no blank on the financial statement for "cryptocurrency". Come on, bro... That's your BTC (unless she contributed... Which if she is anything like my ex wife, she didn't)
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:18:05
Buy a hardware wallet and transfer your coins to the wallet address. Trezor and Ledger are good options. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:03:03
How do we use this to determine price in 3 years? Can we do more than 25 days.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:56:50
Same, preferably.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:19:33
Never sell for USD. Spend at retailers.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:48:46
It asks for mine too. I wish there was an easier way.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:53:40
Come. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:40:29
The struggle is real. I have over 20k available credit and coinbase still has me stuck at 500/wk. Looks like I can request limit increase in 2 days.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:58:07
It's a shame I can't go buy fentanyl with USD
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:29:12
I am considering taking the stickers off. At first, it was to spread awareness. Now I'm legit scared of losing this money. It's more than I've ever had.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:01:26
Use segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:03:43
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:33:06
I have about 20k more credit limit and its so hard not to click that buy button.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:00:20
I'm sure it will correct after the fork, just like with Bcash. Aug 1 Price: 2700. Aug 30 Price: 4700
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:50:37
Best response. Ty
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:27:25
I have BTC stickers on my shitty 2009 chevy. Noone would think twice regarding how much I am worth.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:11:11
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:45:06
Always rebuy.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:39:11
James bond would have had his trezor
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:15:57
You can get it through coinbase. 0 conversion fees, 0 transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:27:10
How are you managing?
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:22:57
I'm about to be doing the same thing.
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:50:54
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:31:00
Going to 6500
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:48:21
That's be a phenomenal idea. We need to reach a much larger audience. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:41:43
I used to buy tickets every week. I havent bought a single one since my first bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:26:38
Gdax has no cc option
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:02:34
The only verified authentic copies available are selling for 50k plus. Looks like a digital scan is in my future lol
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:01:09
52000 is poor. Where the fuck can you support a family of 4 with 52000
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:23:01
My first coin was $3380 and I think my average buy in is around 4k.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:31:23
I legit panicked when I saw the -350.00 in 24 hours along with the reddit posts about crashing to 3k. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:56:24
I honestly love Navy Fed. I have my home and auto loan through them and they have very reasonable rates.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:21:56
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:49:57
Given that I'd be a multi millionaire, I wouldn't give a shit about a $400 cup of coffee.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:07:34
I would be ecstatic if that were the case.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:28:37
Could it be because i had just bought them on GDAX then immediately tried to transfer them? Maybe the original transaction is still unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:13:56
Ditto. My ex lived off of me for 4 years. New gf is 7 years younger than my ex and a medical professional.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:25:52
But not on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:04:16
I still have 27k credit limit on my cards combined and it's so hard not to just say "Yolo, fuck it".
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:00:02
We've all made enough over the last 30 days to eat a little in fees or rise. I am appreciative of what BTC has done for me, so want to give back a little by purchasing goods and services with BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:17:53
Yeah. That tiny coffee was almost $5.00 lol.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:10:18
3 years.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:15:15
If you hold your private keys, nobody can take your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:09:28
I need it to hit 10k
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:13:33
No fee
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:59:01
I typically rebuy in BTC terms.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:29:28
Not really, it will teach users to HODL and spend at retailers. Never sell. I'm about to buy my lunch with BTC
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:29:53
Came that way.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:16:50
But how do other exchanges keep up to avoid different prices for example, if a whale bought on GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:16:22
I know, right?
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:19:55
You can, especially if you want to lose your coins.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:59:31
So you're saying I didn't buy Bitcoin at $1000 the other day?
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:40:22
Does that mean they can see how much BTC you own though?
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:54:13
I love how you can use credit card on gdax
