Thanks for the suggestions! I actually haven't used ghostery before so I'll check it out. The unfortunate part here though is if this actually was a phishing page that somehow got into my browser cache, or even a man in the middle attack (unlikely) none of these tools would have prevented it. If only https everywhere was available for safari :(

I know there are about 5 of these floating around out there but if the code helps you in any way, feel free to use it!

Wasn't this already proposed in BIP15? Also... does anyone know why BIP15 never went anywhere?
EDIT: I seen now that BIP15 has been edited to reflect that BIP70 is its continuation...woohoo!! :D

I actually was planning on starting a project just like this... it'll be a module/class that can be dropped into your web server (and it sounds like a wordpress plugin would be great too) and acts as a paywall for content you want to charge for. While bitmonet does seem to do the same thing, their github repo is empty and there's plenty of room to expand on the idea ...if anyone is interested in collaborating let me know!

Good call... I'd definitely suggest an old version over trusting a random stranger for anyone not confident with diffs
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:15:20
keep it up! and have a coffee :) @_date: 2015-04-13 03:27:19
Love it, love the communication from slush and satoshilabs, but I also keep some paper wallets in case my trezor dies and I need to buy a new one :D
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:13:08
Ah I should clarify...I'd really only trust restoring my seed onto another trezor :)

You could just hash the image file and use the hash for a brainwallet password
edit: misunderstood you. This would not work if the picture was printed, only if it was kept as a digital file
@_date: 2015-04-03 05:55:39
I might suggest some address specific methods such as getAddressBalance() and getAddressHistory() or something along those lines
edit: 
To expand on the gitignore subject, a file named .gitignore is usually included in the root directory of your project to automatically ignore certain files when you push to your repo. Example templates can be found [here](
Awesome job though! :)

Currently the value I see in the Bitcoin token is that it is a means of irreversible transaction, they are limited in quantity, and its security is based in mathematics rather than violence. How much each bitcoin is worth is up to the market. We put our trust in government issued currencies for much the same reasons; they are a means of somewhat irreversible transaction, they are limited in quantity (not really) and we trust our governments to detect and eliminate counterfeits.
Your coat hangar analogy is not wrong though. Unlike traditional currency, additional value or data can be attached to the Bitcoin network. Some people may never value the coat hangar and only desire it to teleport their coats more easily. Some people may not even know they are using the coat hangar for convenient coat transportation. But if no one values the coat hangar the game is over.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:44:22
Your implication was that the coat hangars were akin to bitcoins. Your analogy lacks the key point that without the broken coat hangars being sent and received, the whole network stops working. The value the coat hangars provide to society is that they keep the network running.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:18:18
If these broken coat hangars are the fuel that keep the largest and safest distributed teleportation network in the world running, then I would consider them to be of value.

You got it! Electrum will look and function the exact same, it just no longer contains your private keys. Also, if you are expecting a large deposit, you can plug the Trezor in and right click your receiving address in electrum and choose "view on Trezor" to verify that it is a valid address and that your electrum instance hasn't been tampered with.

If you don't find anything I'd be willing to write something up and run it on my server to email you every day/hour/whatever :)
edit: didn't read the comments first lol... let me know if you need any help!
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:26:36
I also just got a pi 2 from adafruit! Great store with lots of awesome stuff
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:02:21
Could use a little optimizing, but it seems functional on my iPhone 6 :)
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:24:38
Leetcoin!! I love you for this haha
@_date: 2015-03-12 08:08:20
I was just able to sign up using my amex credit card...are some already supported?
edit: never mind I see it stops you when trying to make a purchase...still awesome though!
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:08:56
Try out mycelium or breadwallet :)
4000 bits @_date: 2015-03-26 22:55:45
that's OP's point thought...use the bitcoin as a tripwire to know if your system gets compromised. He intends for it to be stolen
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:05:48
I have a similar tool for OS X... I'd love to combine our projects under a common name with a common UX if you'd be open to it!

By use and interact I mean make changes to the Bitcoin blockchain. Without the bitcoin token you cannot make changes to the blockchain. The main change most people are making is with the intent to transfer a quantity of currency from one individual to another. Other potential intents are: embedding arbitrary data in the blockchain, proving an entity is in control of a certain amount of currency, creating or moving a digital asset, destroying currency, etc.

Your concern is valid it's just something that most around here take as an acceptable risk. Most of us believe in Bitcoin over the other networks because Bitcoin was the original and has stood the test of time. Bitcoin adapts to problems and grows because of the developer community it has created. It is more likely for desired changes to be patched into Bitcoin than for a separate network to surpass Bitcoin in popularity. The community itself has added value to the network.
Think of Bitcoin like cash. If you keep a million US dollars in your basement, but the US government fails, how much is your paper worth? What is its intrinsic value if there is no society that accepts it as payment anymore? As long as the Bitcoin network is in operation, the intrinsic value of the bitcoin token is that it allows you to use and interact with the Bitcoin network.

I've had great success with gifting paper wallets to people. I feel like most people get excited about having something physical to hold on to and it seems to spark their curiosity much more than just talking about it. Usually the response I get is something like "Oh wow thank you!! What do I do with it??"

[Changetip]( is a tip bot that lets you send bitcoin over various internet accounts. Once you decide on a wallet you want to try out, visit changetip's website and log in with your reddit account and you'll be able to send the btc to your wallet's address
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:24:53
Trezor integrates directly with electrum, so once you have it set up you'll use electrum the way you always have, you'll just need to plug in your Trezor for it to allow spending.
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:48:56
Yeah 4,000 bits = 0.004 BTC :)
A bit is one millionth of a bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:41:04
Then you should be able to just log in using your reddit credentials

I think you may be overcomplicating things. The intrinsic value provided by the bitcoin token is its ability to let you make changes to the blockchain. I was simply listing some reasons why people make changes to the blockchain, and what makes Bitcoin valuable to them as individuals.
Not sure how technical of an explanation you'd like so I'll start pretty general: the current protocol allows anyone to attach up to 80 bytes of data to a transaction. One idea for a digital asset uses this space to digitally represent something that should have a specific quantity and should be resistant counterfeit (concert tickets, house deed, car title) but may also benefit from being transferable from one owner to the next. Bitcoin makes this possible and without the need for a third party. A concert venue could issue tickets as digital assets, and an individual who purchased a ticket is free to resell it without needing to check with the venue, and without being able to duplicate the ticket.
This is just one example though. Many people are looking at the blockchain for a variety of different uses, but anyone who wants to use the blockchain must have bitcoins to do so.

Oh nice! Wasn't aware of that

Got to buy my dad breakfast and show him how easy Bitcoin can be. I've used it online but this was actually my first time using it in the real word, and it was faster than using card or cash. The restaurant, [Isabel]( in downtown Portland, was set up with a tablet using BitPay and checkout took all of 10 seconds. Food was delicious, I'll definitely be returning!!
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:20:22
They do currently have [this]( posted on the door but a neon sign would be awesome
@_date: 2015-03-07 11:43:45
please make this happen coinbase!
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:15:56
:D love your work! Have a coffee!
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:36:58
Try Breadwallet! It's the only iOS wallet that connects directly to the Bitcoin network
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:57:41
It was coconut french toast :)
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:15:58
Haha well I agree looking at it now it does look like fish... and that does sound equally delicious! but it was huge slices of french bread with coconut shavings and a jarritos bottle full of syrup... anyways now I know what I'm having for dinner lol
