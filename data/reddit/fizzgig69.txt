Everyone is allowed to use the blockchain now. Raising the blocksize limit would incentivize more people to use the blockchain but remember how opposed this community was to unnecessary promotion early on? Allow for natural growth of Bitcoin and keep it healthy.

If you desire anonymity from institutions you will have to stay in bitcoin and not move to cash (or find people to trade you anonymously, after you have acquired bitcoin). Bitpay and Coinbase will help you if you are ok with giving up your information to third parties.

The most popular solutions are Bitpay and Coinbase. Coinbase is free for your first $1,000,000 of transactions, then it's 1%. Bitpay is free processing with pricing plans for additional business and enterprise features.

THANK YOU PETER TODD! I was thinking last night...why doesn't anyone actually frame the problem in a way that makes sense? This entire community seems to be infested with bad ideas which have been built on false assumptions. We need clarity and leadership of ideas.
The capacity issue is finally coming! Let's take this step by step and organize our thoughts into a plan that will transition Bitcoin into the best future version it can be.
Right now the winning miner gets to scoop up some fees for some extra bitcoin, this is not at all how fees should work, it provides no incentives and serves no purpose, it is the result of an anti-spam patch. We never dealt with the issue back then so let's frame the problem in the right way and finally slay this beast.
The "fee" market works opposite of the "bitcoin" market in the sense that miners are the bidders, and users put up the offers as fees. As long as there are a finite number of transactions, fees can maintain a level of close to 0. By raising the block limit we are trying to live in an era where the number of transactions coming in are finite and small enough to deal with (i.e. working well under capacity). We will solve the problem better if we are working in an environment in which we feel the effects of the problem. If we don't feel the problem, we don't solve it...
So let's plan on more transactions, which means bigger queues. We need better ways of incentivizing miners to include the best fees, we need an intuitive process by which a transaction can be submitted and reliably mined x blocks into the future, one that the user can understand, see in real time, undo if not yet confirmed, and resubmit new fee values give better block estimates.
Only Bitcoin can deal with these problems due to our popularity in the cryptocurrency space. I understand if you are afraid Bitcoin will choke and die due to overcapacity but Bitcoin is resilient, we should focus on the fundamentals.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:55:07
Oh, if that is the case you have a few forks in the road.
Do you own a store and want an interface? Your merchant software may have a Bitcoin module you can use.
Do you want cash payments to a bank account? Choose a payment processor like bitpay or coinbase.
Do you want a simple solution where all users pay to the same Bitcoin address, posted on a website? Just use wallet software like Mycelium or Breadwallet.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:57:59
What is this fundamental value I speak of? Indelible proof. True history. The holy grail?
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:22:24
I was feeling passionate at the time and really we just don't have answers but what is frustrating is that Bitcoin will almost certainly be something else, what will it be, how should it function in an ideal world? A lot of smart people are thinking about this so that makes me feel better. I don't have the answer =(
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:34:38
A private key is the number you need to send bitcoin from one address to another, wallet software manages these keys to perform this task. However, by writing down this private key you can erase all digital proof that the key ever existed. Years later you can import the key into a wallet, and spend them.
See an example here, the Base58 Wallet Import format is what you will be looking for:

The US gov has dumped like 100k+ on the market and we are still fine, as time moves on the market will be able to handle that risk better and better. They are going to dump around 40k more and the silk road debacle resulted in hundreds of thousands of coins in the hands of who knows who. That is still the tiny minority, Bitcoin just keeps getting bigger so it can handle shocks that would have really hurt it years ago.
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:36:18
Consider the transaction volume, overall strength of the economy, as it grows it's ability to handle shocks increases. If a million coins sent the price to $2, Bitcoin could either handle it or not. We would see, but the later this happens the easier it would be to survive.
For example, if a million coin dump happened at $10,000 per bitcoin the price could be driven all the way to $100 (arbitrary 1% example) but we'd be in a stronger position than if it happened today.

If your bank doesn't like Circle they may close your account temporarily or permanently, or if you do something shady with the coins Circle may close your circle account. Every transaction you make within that transaction network is known by those parties.
Also, if you purchase Bitcoin from Circle and store them on your Circle account long term, you take the risk of Circle losing your coins. Insurance may pick up the lost amount in dollar terms but by that time the price of Bitcoin may go up by an order of magnitude. If you transfer the Bitcoin balance from Circle to your own private keys you no longer have that risk, you then take on the risk of your own personal management of private keys, a risk that a lot of us in the Bitcoin community prefer!
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:11:57
Yeah banks using Bitcoin today could do the exact same fraction reserve process. However, they could not be bailed out if they go bankrupt. Also, investors in the bank would lose their money. This is how it always was with gold until the people chose to use money which banks issued.

The idea is right yeah, but the resulting price is not knowable. Today the price needs only a few thousand bitcoins to move up $20 so a loss of 10% of the supply would be shocking and move the price quickly as that information was not yet priced in.

According to your logic, if we collectively put 6 billion dollars into Bitcoin, it will rise double in price. It only takes a few million to move the market like 5%. However, at the higher level demand has to support that price, so the actual price is not directly related to demand. At any rate, we have a lot of room to grow.

Love the Biff Tanner analogy! Another good one is from Andreas Antonopoulos describing alt currency as part of a diverse ecosystem (like a rainforest).

3600 new bitcoins come online every day, that is over 2 million dollars worth at current exchange rates. In an efficient market the price should tend toward the point where the $ flowing in equals the number of bitcoins being issued by the network (in aggregate, averaged out). Otherwise the price couldn't support itself and would adjust. I guess more than 2 million dollars per day are flowing in right now as we seem to be going up and up.
It only took about 1.8 million per day to sustain $500, and it would take 360k to sustain $100. If the price were $1 it would take a few thousand dollars a day to keep the price at that level.
These are all just estimates and depend totally on what the individuals who get the coins decide to do with them, if the miners all become rich and decide they can afford to save their coins instead of spend them, the market price would feel it. Same thing if a meteor destroyed a bunch of private keys.

I have a tip, since your life savings is meager but still has great potential, just pretend it's gone and you are starting from nothing. Work hard to get back your savings and don't focus on what you have put away. Store your coins on paper securely and come back in a few years.
Remember, great opportunities are coming so work hard and invest in those too, repeat this cycle a few times and you will not worry about money any more.
Many people will enter this phase which will precipitate the coming inflation, so be frugal and hard working, develop good habits to maintain a sustainable lifestyle and a good example for generations to come. Go savings!

If Bitcoin is simulating anything it is gold, should we call it a virtual precious metal? No, Bitcoin is simply a protocol, it would be like calling the internet a virtual network. No, it is simply a network.
Virtual misleads the ignorant into shelving the concept into the following mental pigeon holes: virtual versions of dollars, gift certificates, mmo gaming, unreal, fake, or not genuine.

Yeah but what do you mean by inflation, do you mean what they tell us? or do you mean what the prices actually reflect? or do you mean the increase of money supply that is officially stated? or do you mean the actual increase of money which is a number no one really knows?
It seems what you are referring to is people's perception of inflation, as long as TPTB can manage our expectations they can continue the racket. Once people start comparing the currency of the internet to their local currency, they should be pretty disgusted (who would use a Govcoin which had a central issuer and variable market cap, let alone none of the technological advantages?).

When will people understand that Bitcoin is an ecosystem of supply and demand in and of itself? Economists and Speculators study the larger trends but the short term price can be moved by any one of millions of people throwing in a few bucks.
There was no good news, just a surge of a few million dollars worth of capital into a few exchanges. That's all it takes to move the price up at a market cap of a few billion dollars, the mass of Bitcoin users who spend their Bitcoins and miners who sell their newly mined bitcoins are what makes the price go down.
News can change psychology but a 10% move in Bitcoin is not psychological, a 1000% move is.

Everyone here is completely wrong-headed, you all aren't even starting from the right frame of mind!!!
Dogecoin is an expression of humanity's desire for honesty, kindness, and generosity. Many people who share these desires are empowered by learning about distributed technologies like Dogecoin, then eventually Bitcoin.
The very idea of Dogecoin VS Bitcoin is backward in so many ways, they help each other out and bring stability to the whole ecosystem. They both bring more awareness to people and recruit more users, we need both to be strong pillars upon which new, younger, more innovative coins can be built. We have to build more open source systems, fork and multiply them to make them stronger.
I'd be much happier if we as a community focused on differences of these: Open source/decentralized systems VS Proprietary/centralized systems.

The wealthy/famous individuals will have incentive to be anonymous, while many regular users will not. The users who aren't anonymous will only encourage changes to the protocol which will weaken Bitcoin. We have to stand firm in the principle lest enemies find weakness and exploit it.
If TCP/IP was written in a way to hide the owners of web domains the internet would be a much better place, even with all the immoral things that may happen on it. Now we have censorship until a new internet comes along. The purpose of the protocol is to be neutral, not allow individuals to decide what is allowed online and what is not. Principles are really important in this intellectual struggle.

Yet they spend multiples of that every day on food that is killing them and on useless junk that is supporting the destruction of their world.

Libertarianism isn't voluntary since it supports government which is force. Anarchism and Voluntaryism, among others, are voluntary.
If one chooses to associate with an entity the government doesn't approve of, that person gets locked in a cage which is not voluntary association. If you've concluded that we can have a government of force and still keep checks on it, look at all the examples from history, it's never happened before.
Whatever words people use don't count, it's actions plus consistency of ideas which will lead you to the truth. Libertarians, Republicans, Democrats, Statists, Academics, Worshipers of Religion, even many entrepreneurs, all use words which contradict each other if you take a moment to really listen to them and ponder their implications.

It's a shame he feels like he needs to comment on something he has no knowledge of. The real problem is he does not look at Bitcoin objectively. He reads from others what Bitcoin is, he thinks it's a wannabe currency, he thinks it's this, he thinks it's that. He doesn't look at Bitcoin for what it actually IS. Start from the beginning: Bitcoin is Open Source Software. Bitcoin is an invention which enables a distributed network of individuals interact with each other without the need for trust. Bitcoin is acting like a currency right now because the rights to this network are limited, so demand results in price. The implications are so far reaching yet most people don't even look past the idea that it's an electronic currency...

I get what you are saying when you say "any laws are good for bitcoin." You mean that once a law is established, tax paying business can establish itself and thus encourage growth in the Bitcoin economy.
Those who would give up liberty for security will lose both and deserve neither. Members of our community are compromising the promise of Bitcoin in order to guarantee future growth, is that really a smart idea? Just because regulation, according to some, is inevitable?
This is happening from the top down, a law that will attempt to control the actions of millions, so they are taking their time to make sure they craft regulation which will affect the behavior of as many people as possible. There is a fine line between a law which everyone obeys and a law that everyone ignores, look at the millions of laws in place today that are never enforced. Members of this open source community should shun ideas which make no sense.
You alone choose what actions you take. If enough people follow what is right, bad law will never gain the momentum it needs to become supported by society and fully enforced. Take the time to educate yourself on what is true.

Doug Jackson (Founder of E-Gold) on Bitcoin:
1. He claims paper money isn't created out of thin air because it is recorded on balance sheets.
2. He claims alt coins are somehow related to Bitcoin scarcity.
3. He says the distributed nature of Bitcoin is compromised by concentration of miners, and if governments kick down the door the system is doomed.
4. He says the excitement about Bitcoin comes from the price rise.
5. He says money isn't an investment, implying that Bitcoin is money and nothing more.
6. He says that Anonymity is a flaw, privacy is what people want out of money.
7. He then pimps an alternative system where a GIANT PILE OF GOLD is the basis of the monetary system, good luck. Learn from history, or should I say experience? =*(
Fizzgig69 (loser, drop out, fellatio extraordinaire) responds:
1. So they keep track of paper created out of thin air then? Ok I guess it's created out of carefully tallied thin air, the point is the banks control what is "backing" the paper, not you, not me. They are using "play money" to steal real wealth.
2. Bitcoin is a protocol, creating more copies of the protocol will not change the fact that Bitcoin is scarce.
3. If concentration becomes an issue and is attacked, that will solve the problem of concentration, it will not destroy Bitcoin unless the attack is coordinated throughout the world and the Bitcoin users do nothing to react to such a situation.
4. The excitement of Bitcoin comes from the implications brought about by the solution to the Byzantine's General Problem.
5. This implies that Bitcoin is money and nothing more, it is a distributed consensus mechanism which allows trustless contracts, see 
6. Anonymity will become more and more important as totalitarianism becomes more and more ubiquitous.
7. The whole point is that money is a network, it is information. Why burden it with physicality? He is living in the stone age but so are most people unfortunately. When will they learn?

Wrong. He says contracts are unenforceable and so he doesn't use them. Smart contracts are enforceable so we are not even in the same world here. If he knew how to use them effectively he would, because they are useful, unlike written contracts today.
The interviewer was challenging him and completely missed his point about enforceability which was very disappointing. Albini recognizes the system is broke so he wants no system at all. If he had a system that worked to compare it to we could have a real discussion. It's not easy to describe how smart contracts work and how they benefit him because the tech is still immature.
Here is a link to the discussion, which is quite good.

Excellent example of false choice (let the federal or local government build the roads?) and problem-reaction-solution (every problem assumes the necessity of a solution in this video).
What isn't discussed is how much more paper money was printed than gold in fort knox at that time, an unsound monetary system is the cause of all of these problems.

Why hold dollars? 5% of the money supply is created every year and used at the current holders expense. A new Satoshi every year who takes his million bitcoins (~1 trillion dollars worth?) and spends them on the military industrial complex. Except every year the amount goes up because there is no hard cap on the number of dollars in existence. That is what you are supporting when you hold and use dollars, its pretty gross.
But yes, temporary disruption is all, just as this last downtrend is temporary.

Yeah dude, people just seem to explain things technically. What is the sun, it's a giant ball of gas and nuclear energy...not helpful. But seriously, what is mining?
Miners verify transactions. Let's say you take those new bits you got and send them to a charity, you input the correct inputs in your (likely online) wallet and hit send! Bing! You did the world good! But how does the transaction actually get VERIFIED? How does your money get sent to the person you want it to go to? Miners! Your fee will pay the miner who verifies your transaction. Anyone can be a miner, just set up a computer and chug away and you could (if you are damn good) get paid. That's why this system is decentralized! The technicals are all in the videos, documentation, and open source code.
I'm sure lots of this doesn't make sense, there are a lot of parts that have to come together.

We already have 8 decimal places, .00000001 could be extended to 16, if that wasn't enough we could double it to 32. that should be enough.
0.00000000000000000000000000000001 btc
I think programmatically it's more likely we will just double the digits to 16 and that would be enough granularity to last for a very long time.

No problem, I thought of something to tell you about your new bits. Since they were just sent to you they have a kind of low priority, which means that if you send them you will have to compete with all the other transactions to be included in the next block. That is where the fee comes in.
Let's say you send a transaction that is both new and has no (or a low) fee sent with it, it won't be included in the next block, so you will wait for another block. Again, maybe a bunch of transactions came in with fees and your transaction is bumped to the next block. Your transaction could be left hanging for weeks until you resend that amount with enough of a fee to be included into the next block.
However, if you do not send a transaction now and hold the coins for months or years, your bitcoins become 'old' and you will be able to send them with no fee. Also, they will be included in the next block with high priority. The algorithm is out there. This concept is linked to "Bitcoin Days Destroyed."
Important caveat: This only applies if your coins are being managed by your own wallet software and not a third party such as changetip, coinbase, exchanges, etc. If you keep your coins in the control of a third party, you can generally send with no fees whenever you want. But then you run the risk of not controlling your own funds, and that leads to Mt.Gox.

70 years from now we will have Bitcoin the "money" used by everyone, government approved, works like a charm, lacks anonymity and compromises decentralization for transaction speed and volume.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin the "distributed ledger" will be used and developed by heretics who will try to incorporate Aristotle's principles to make it the best money possible. This is opposed by the people who think that money should be guaranteed and issued on behalf of governments.
These developers are heretics because they build systems that will facilitate criminals. We can forgive the original developers for working on the early Bitcoin protocol before there was an official alternative.

Sounds like a plan, which market would you like to use? Also, as the price went down on our market, how would we stop the arbitragers from buying up locally cheap coins to sell to other markets, I guess we would have to overpower them. Ok keep selling...as we run out of coins we could always buy more from other sources, but I guess that would drive the price back up...maybe we could create artificial contracts with no real bitcoin backing and sell those onto the market as though they are the real thing like they do in real life markets. No I guess those haven't been invented yet. Conclusion: we need to work with the shills to convince the populace that we need to modify the markets by allowing bankers to do their job...if we want this to work.

I could see how Satoshi may have discarded his mining rewards. Every single bitcoin he lost contributed to the potential success of Bitcoin in the future. Remember at the time the currency was struggling to simply survive, any vulnerability could have killed the entire project. He may have done everything he could to simply ensure the future success of his project.
Each coin becomes a future liability, a potential to be tracked, and he seemed only concerned about the viability of his project. I can see a world where he simply let the mining rewards evaporate into thin air. After all, it wasn't really a competition at that point, it seems hardly fair, perhaps not worth the risk, and Satoshi seems like a pretty honorable person. I stand on the side of Satoshi stash: lost.

Every four years the reward is cut in half. That means that every 10 minutes, instead of mining 25 bitcoin (like we do today), we would mine 12.5 bitcoin.
The implication is that eventually we will be mining no more new bitcoin. If you divide a number by 2 enough times it will trend to 0 faster than you would think, even though it takes a very long time to halve (4 years). Go ahead and take a calculator and hit 50, then divide by 2, again, again, again, each time counting up 4 years. You will find that in only about 130 years there will be no more coins to mine, and the system will be sustained on fees alone.

This is a great article, it exposes how much damage taxes can do to your wealth and why that reason alone can be motivation to move a fraction of assets to Bitcoin. It's interesting that so many hold the view of 'tax dodging' when as the article points out the government has no ownership or real reason to have anything to do with digital currency, yet they claim ownership of a percentage of all capital gained by it. Pretty damn arrogant and absurd, because of this it will be more mainstream in the future to just not report or bother paying, taxation should be voluntary in a real sense with regard to digital currency. As more people hold this view, policy will shift toward supporting laws which will enforce these ideas.

@_date: 2015-07-10 17:07:23
I've been struggling thinking about this concept, I can't tell yet if a major part of Bitcoin will have to change to solve this problem or if looking at the problem a different way will render it invalid.
Perhaps the best solution is what we have now: a fee structure that increases your chances of getting into the next block as the fee increase. In this way transactions compete against each other, a kind of reverse market, rather than miners providing a price.
I can't help but feel like there is a different way that is clearly better.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:11:23
Two chains can exist at the same time in competition, both with blocks at the end. This happens a few times a week, two blocks are more common than three, and four is even less common. What does this mean in terms of double spends? I'm not sure but I think it's rare and difficult to pull off, but not outright impossible up to two or three blocks.
When you get to four confirmations it's very very difficult to reverse the transaction, even more so with five, and with six confirmations the transaction is considered to be permanent, not just because the attacker would need to reverse six blocks, but also because a six block long fork is extremely rare as well. Either of which can result in double spends.

Yes, however, to check the current node status you have to check with other peers.

You will check to see if a fork is present, and if it isn't, you cannot prove there is not some other potential fork out there.

you could always just boot you computer up with a usb stick, format it using rufus to launch ubuntu (by downloading the ubuntu iso, pointing to it in rufus).
Now get another usb and find an online wallet generator that's open source, save the html file onto the usb.
Boot up ubuntu on your usb, run it off the stick, unplug your internet beforehand, disable networks, run the html file from your other usb in offline mode, generate a key, write it down on a piece of paper.
It wont matter if your hd is infected, the operating system will be running from the usb, when you shut down all information will be lost.
total cost, 2 usb sticks, or a usb stick and a floppy =)

If we raised the block limit nothing would explode, also it would be almost impossible to decrease it because there would be no reason or economic incentive to do so. Raising the block limit would just deny us the optimal environment to fix real problems. To raise the block limit is to leap for an end without justifying the means. Oh right, that's what our entire world is about, no wonder this is such an issue. Will we ever learn? No, that's why Hearn.

If it was a fork due to version incompatibility, that's a bit different, that's not what the op is asking about. His question assumes the network is working properly (when it's not, problems are addressed and corrected by the community). Using natural here isn't the best choice of words.

You are referring to the question: "What if I run the TREZOR recovery process on an infected computer?"
If so, that protects against keylogging during the recovery process, not screen capture during the key generation process. Perhaps they have solved this problem, I couldn't find a question on their faq which addresses this, but I really haven't looked into it much. After seeing how the setup process worked I was startled by the fact that the recovery key words are shown on the screen.

In this sense Bitcoin can exhibit it's anti-fragile characteristics. Keeping the good transactions flowing while the bad (edit: less good) transactions are slowly confirmed over time as the spam attacks lose traction. This is a very interesting time in Bitcoin history!
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:06:21
Your post exposes the fact that raising the block limit won't do anything to help the situation. Attackers can still spam the blockchain with a bigger block size, then we are left with less time to fix the problem.
This recent mass of transactions will give us insight into how to deal with the problem long term. Raising the limit isn't the solution.

35k physical silver, 13k physical (keys written on paper) bitcoin, 2k physical gold. If you don't hold it, you don't own it. Silver is the most undervalued asset, aside from crypto, that I have ever found.

One dollar will be worth one dollar six months from now, that doesn't mean it's stable. One bitcoin will be worth one bitcoin and 1 doge = 1 doge over the same time period. You are too conditioned to measuring value by dollars, you forgot that your measuring stick changes length over time.
So yes, obviously a dollar will always be worth a dollar. But why is it that a 2015 dollar is worth less than a dollar from a previous era? Whatever logic is used to justify this value loss, fundamentally it's theft.

People who acquire gold, guns, and silver are NOT doing it for status or pride. They are derided by the ignorant and persecuted by the law.
The one unconscious thread that connects all of our desires for status is: **DISEMPOWERMENT OF THE SELF**. Bitcoin will not ever be a status symbol for the mass consumer because the power structure is not strengthened by Bitcoin. Those on the bottom of this pyramid are interested in empowering those above them, and disempowering themselves. That is why most people immediately find Bitcoin confusing and scary (unless they are innocent/young/naive/curious).
We are not interested in trying to solve the masses insatiable desires for self destruction. Instead, let's build the world that we want to live in, and let them live in the world they want to live in, always in peace.

We have ways of creating blocksize efficiency. Wallets will make RBF the default way to send coins, then if you want, check a box that says "send transaction irreversibly (for use with 0-conf services such as Shapeshift, Fold, etc)"
More efficiencies will be developed as we wait for someone to solve the blocksize problem in a way that minimizes the pain on all parties. If the blocksize was too small to handle transactions the community would react immediately, hardforking is easy when an actual crisis is in the works, blocksize isn't a problem yet. Bitstamp is just doing what is in their interest.

Back when Bitcoin was accepted by Overstock, would you have said wait until Amazon accepts Bitcoin so that others will follow? That is not how Bitcoin works, it gives advantages to players who have more to lose, more ways to take risk.
Bitcoin spreads slowly but strongly, it consistently persists because it provides value to those who adopt it. In all areas it is a relatively small player who adopts Bitcoin first, until the avalanche of human perception can no longer maintain the pessimism and revaluation exposes the extent of the markets failure to account for this change of mind.

This exposes the flawed thinking behind the push for bigger blocks. We all know it was for the benefit of large corporate partners who want to use the blockchain as a money spigot for their apps. We need a more balanced approach which increases capacity for all without pitting one group against another.

The economics of Bitcoin are always changing as hash rates/difficulty rises and we approach the next halving. Sure miners may give up, but the ones left mining at a loss for the longest period of time will result in more holding and less supply on the market. Price will reflect this, it is the invisible hand of the market which provides information to participants en mass without giving up the privacy of any individual actors. If difficulty adjustment becomes problematic the price could fall, but that would only encourage a more competitive mining market, reducing supply more and encouraging others to buy until a new equilibrium is reached. Bubbles happen when this balance can no longer be maintained, supply can no longer be provided, and demand is driven by greed.
Between supply, demand, difficulty, hash rate, and price, equilibrium will be found. There is no death spiral to zero or moon rocket to infinity under normal circumstances. Two exceptional circumstances being a bug or fatal flaw in Bitcoin or a flaw in the design of fiat currencies. That is why to the moon is a popular phrase among bitcoiners, we realize that fiat currency is flawed. Does this help at all, do you already know all this, are you just concerned about a price drop? The price falling is not the end of Bitcoin or even a problem for it's functionality.

No, it doesn't matter how fast blocks are mined, the same amount of coins will be generated. Nothing would change at all, well before the reward falls to a few bits miners will switch to mining for fees rather than block rewards. The only thing that would be affected by a sudden increase in hashing power is the mining difficulty, which is adjusted every two weeks on average, but would adjust faster because of the large amount of hashing power.

Demand is measurable. Look at the demand yesterday, then the day before that, and before that, see a pattern? We don't need to see the future just look at the past. Stop trying to divine the intentions of buyers. People buy bitcoin with hopes of making money? All this speculation is irrelevant, we literally have the volume right in front of our faces and you are trying to tell a story which is complete speculation.
My turn to tell a story: New people learn about Bitcoin, they buy it because they don't have bitcoin. They hold it because they don't want to have zero bitcoin. Repeat. All you worry-warts who are too concerned about this story or that resulting in Bitcoin's demise are going to feel the pain of your own failure time and time again, just be sure to recognize the failure as solely your own or you will be doomed to repeat it. Again and again. Five times is not enough? You are going to wait until bubble number six and then re-evaluate? Way to stay the conservative straight and narrow.

The price of Bitcoin is like a river. The river flows from a source, it carves the land and is amplified by smaller channels. It is depleted by plants and animals which grow up around the river. When a natural event occurs which channels more water into the river, it may flood and cause damage. If this flooding is anticipated it can be harnessed, resulting in fertile land. The river searches for equilibrium due to a force of nature, gravity. When understood, the river can be utilized for economic gain. Approached carelessly, the river will sweep you away. Predators lurk behind the grass waiting for a thirsty noob to dunk their head in, waiving their juicy butt meat into the air. The water which flows seems endless, what is the point in claiming and defending a section of this river when it is dangerous, volatile, and flows forever? Did you know that water falls from the sky?

If you recognize the value of bitcoins as a currency you should buy them and hold in order to help stabilize them. The fact is they won't be stable with a paltry $12 billion market cap, buy and hold and drive up the price to find real stability. Also, stability for Bitcoin won't mean an even price, it will mean a steady growth year over year because the value will go up and up and up...and never go down...because this time it's different...!

Bitcoin focuses on SHA-256, Primecoin focus on the mathematics behind prime numbers, and a new coin may focus on a different problem. There is no reason to reject new alternative currencies.
I say have as many crypto-currencies in the wild as there are species of insect in the rainforest...why not more?! The technical challenges are just that, challenges to be overcome.
If people are free to focus their energies where they will, alternative chains will exist, but only to the extent that people focus on them. Embrace the diversity of the human mind!

This game is a fantastic example of subject value. You can mine gold to buy items to mine gold faster, then buy mines to mine gold/items faster, and on and on. Gold is a sound form of currency in the game based on market dynamics. Markets, Pillaging, Manufacturing, Working, Fishing, all professions you can aspire to once you are established enough.
There are hundreds of items, each with their own supply/demand scenario, so playing the markets can become lucrative but trading in-game items for out-of-game items is not supported, and will simply not work.
Play to explore your options and carve a path. Your decisions decide your fate.

This will be the first time a public official takes their paycheck in Bitcoin. Bitcoin can bring more transparency to government if used wisely, and funds can be raised worldwide and tracked openly.

You could send him a wallet file with 0.00001 but he would have to trust you and hope that no hackers find it online. But that's the point of ebay, they trust you right? It could work if you mentioned it in the description before the auction began.

That is assuming there isn't an out-of-control amount of money out there. What will actually happen is people will be divided into rich and poor, lots of them moving from one to the other, the middle class will be decimated as with all currency failures.

All I see here is a bunch of lame comments at what will be a huge turning point for Bitcoin. This man has the right vision to move us forward, and he has about as many haters as Bitcoin does, coincidence? Nope, ignorance has more to do with it.
Look into what this man has to say. I'd rather miss the Bitcoin boat than the Molyneux boat. Your mindset will help you achieve success in life, a ton of money from Bitcoin may end up facilitating your own destruction. Think carefully about the future, it's all you got and it's going to shit!

Our definition of poverty changes as our wealth increases worldwide (wealth is not simply a measurement of currency units). People should be free to live however they choose, and there will be enough abundance to provide a higher standard of living for every person who wants it because people are be willing to give. As we grow wealthier our standard will continue to rise as history shows.
I included that comment about voluntary poverty because I like to emphasize individual sovereignty. Some will choose to live in poverty for whatever reason, and if that choice is made freely our society will be better for it. Voluntaryism is the way.

What about starving Africans who don't even have a monetary system except for phone minutes? They use it because they have NOTHING else. Look to the 4.5 billion souls who are being stepped on every day to support this elevated lifestyle. Oh but it doesn't support your leechy style? Then just say it so that the rest of us who have morals can just ignore you.
Full disclosure: I've invested a small amount of coins to spread Bitcoin in Africa and elsewhere. I think people should selfishly invest but opportunity lies in ventures outside of your immediate self interest. And yes, we know Krugman isn't interested in a decentralized currency, but there are many features of Bitcoin he is interested in but they conflict with his version of what reality should be. It's like an old guy ranting against email in 1994, just use the damn Bitcoins and you won't say such ridiculous things.

That's why alts have gained a huge amount of value too. I think they are like 5% of the Bitcoin market cap, even at 1% that is still a hundred million dollars...we can't even fathom how much debt exists, all created by fiat.

His/Her/Their motivations are pretty obvious considering no one knows who, when, where, or what he/she/they is/are: To create a financial tool that is transparent.
This implies that finance today is not transparent. The overseers of this opaque system are hostile to potential change.
Obvious motivation is obvious.

Bitcoin is scarce, not infinite. It is infinitely divisible in theory, which means that there can be an infinite number of units, not infinite value. All of the atomic units will still add up to the same $13 billion market cap, and you will have your share of that market cap as long as you hold bitcoins.
The reason bitcoins are always available is because of the pricing mechanism, enough holders of bitcions have a price they are willing to sell, so anyone can buy into the protocol no matter how little they contribute. Studying the distribution of bitcoins, the velocity, the price, the suppply, the demand...is Economics.
It's nice learning real things from the real world. Economics is the study of actors in a system, it's about the choices of human beings, not guessing what Bernanke will do next week (though I concede he *is* a human being).

Yes very true, I would not suggest that the starving poor invest in Bitcoin, or even use it at this stage unless risk is first hedged. But the technology has the promise to bring about financial transparency, that is what is impoverishing people all around the world. we cannot see what is really going on, we cannot see how our property is being taken from us...but it is.
I believe that with a fair playing field poverty will eventually become voluntary, so I invest in technology which will promote fair play, is scalable, and if it's decentralized all the better.
