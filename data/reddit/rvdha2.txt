If you expected to cash out, forget it.. Wait times for USD withdrawals on Gox are months and months. There are also long delays on withdrawals of BTC. So once you've deposited, it's going to be stuck there a while...

Even in Romanian currency, the Romanian New Leu which is ~3.35 RON to the dollar, he would need to own around ~300k BTC. Bit of a stretch.

Interesting to know that if you invested US$100 into Bitcoins on this day, 3 years ago ($0.26) you would be sitting on over $100,000 worth of btc today.

there would have to be a serious and fundamental failure in bitcoin for the price to drop close to zero in a quick period of time.. even the latest news means that it will drop to a point where people think it's a bargain and buy back. which is what happened.

Yup, am looking for more a generic look at the applications of virtual/digital/crypto currencies, and it's potential impact, and risks etc. Doing a bit of digging around myself at the moment so will come back when I find a few.

imagine if there was another crash the day before you wanted to withdrawal your college funds, you may not have enough to go to college.
you might not get to go to college, spiral into a depressive cycle, get hooked on krokodil and bath salts and have to live in a squat house selling shit you stole from you mom's place to pay for it..
basically, bitcoin is a high risk investment. if you need that money at a specific point in the future, then don't. Invest what you can afford to lose.

If anyone knew the answers to those questions with some certainty, they wouldn't be telling you. They'd be extremely rich.
Ask yourself, if the price hits $2000 in the coming weeks, will you regret not buying in now. Similarly, if the price halves overnight, would you regret buying in?
Set yourself some up front rules before investing.

I think the bigger message here is that you can actually trade goods for bitcoin in China (given partnering with the exchange). I think there is a misinterpretation of the news yesterday that you *can't* trade goods at all, when the regulation is actually a good thing!

**Risk vs. reward**
* Imagine Bitcoin had crashed since that point of $2 per coin and you lost half of the value of the payment. you'd probably still be saving that it was the biggest mistake you ever made to not accept cash...
* alternatively, you could have diversified the payment.. split cash and bitcoin. you'd have a safety net if btc crashed, but some of the upside with the growth

Ok, so sorry for the lack of understanding here, but by saying "China's government banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin" - how is that different from any other country right now? Or is it more that there is now legislation rather than hope that one day they might..?

what are these assumptions based on?

You pretty much answered your own question - it is a gamble.
Its difficult to answers those questions, but I'll take my personal circumstance as an example.... so I invested what I was willing to lose earlier in the year, stuck through the tanks (admittedly did some panic selling), and continued to buy more at different price points as it rose. I don't consider what I actually invested as something I couldn't afford to lose though.
The only way I can see that it tanking without recovery is a major flaw in the blockchain. My personal view is that it's not likely to occur.
For the moment, there is enough global interest to drive the market - e.g. Israel and China - I'm sure more countries to come... Even when you look at the adoption of retailers using bitcoin, which is going up daily, that drive legitimacy and practicality of using bitcoin - not just for speculation.
So if I were you, and had a bit of spare cash lying around that meant you didn't have to go without food / shelter tonight, then I'd put it in...
If you're that worried about losses, look into setting up a stop-loss.
Ps. don't take financial advice from the internet :)
