No probs. One of my favorite books in this genre is Co-Opetition by Brandenburger and Nalebuff. It has some very interesting and easy to use game theory models that help you think about your business and the market you're in.

I have an MSc (just trolling) and I say this is bull.
A blue ocean strategy, or first mover strategy is not a recipe for guaranteed success. The book you reference was widely criticised* because data on successful companies learns us that a first mover strategy is not the most prevalent amongst successful business. 
There is more evidence that an early-follower strategy is most successful. After the first mover goes into the market, other parties can watch how the market responds to their product, their branding and observe how viable their value proposition is. In the tech industry a first mover often needs to expend great effort to educate the market about their product or service and why people would want it.
Then the astute observers can create a copy cat business, learn from the mistakes in branding/product features etc. from the first mover, and then they undercut their prices because they don't need to spend so much effort (money) in marketing to educate the market about the new technology.
So the good news is that in the case of bitcoin being a first mover is risky (Ask Mt. Gox); early followers have a better chance of cashing in if they are successful in overcoming the difficulties that the first movers ran into.
btw your post is titled "We are part of a 'blue ocean strategy'" but this economic theory is meant to be from the perspective of an organisation, it does not apply to a technology or a market or to consumers, as your title might suggest.
