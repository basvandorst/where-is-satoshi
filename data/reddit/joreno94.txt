Your point is that in early years you make more BTC than near retiring?
I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:26:07
The volume was ~300 BTC don't let yourself fool by big speculative groups. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:03:18
I am currently holding but we need to get more people to buy bitcoin. It is like a ponzie scheme. More people more cash. More money we make as holders.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:05:25
+ it has a little bit ponzie scheme elements. Existing bitcoin holders value only rises based how many newcomers buy into crypto and how much new dumb money is getting in.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:35:14
Seems like great deal. It is so easy to make money these days. I even don't have to work.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:25:23
Do you really think there is no price inflation in BTC.
Let's say, you are young. You get your first job and keep it until you retire. Do you really believe getting the same salary all throught the years? I don't thinks so. There is GREED. People want more and more that drives prices up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:12
I sold and buy if it is a half the price of now. Means double my bitcoin amount.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:16:05
I never went to market. It is another method speculative groups use to make illusion that there is a lot of coins but then cancel their order before it gets into trade.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:45:42
If you can attract more sheeps to buy worthless bitcoin then yes, sky is the limit.
I think party is over for this time. Sheeps who bought are trapped in higher price levels as we know holders.
New wave of sheeps takes another 3-4 years to wait.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:18:53
That I though. Sooner or later we are in the point that there aren't enough BTC in circulation. And price inflation happens anyway no matter what currency is.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:32:06
Yes, no hold anymore time to sell. Price is going to drop really low. And need some cash to buy it low. Sell now and buy 2x or even 3x more bitcoins later.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:57:56
It is very similar to Ponzie scheme manifesto. Holder only benefits if there are new sheeps buying into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:34:11
True, if you not sell now you lose everything you have.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:21
This is normal. If you go to shop you pay tax. This is a tax in bitcoin.

dont use randoms software, they may steal your coins. only use certified software providers.

But if you are making it smaller and smaller pieces. Isn't it equal of "printing money" but other side of the scale.
FIAT printing money = add zeros at the end 1 becomes 10 and then again 100. Finally 100 units of money
BTC printing money = add zeros to beginning 1 becomes 0.1 and then again 0.01. Ouh same result now 100 units of new money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:27:45
wall does not matter, we need new guys into bitcoin. they have real money that we can take from them. keep new folks coming and we (holders) can earn from them. they push the price to over 1mil for sure. Just keep spreading the word bitcoin and let new folks bring us real money.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:51:33
I think it is good time for coinbase and gdax shut down exchange report they have been hacked and all bitcoins are stolen means take all your money. Then start operate under other legal body and repeat process.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:51
Do not invest now. It will drop huge as bitcoin is panic sale.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:06:19
Sell, it is dropping.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:29:59
No hold anymore, this is going to be deep drop.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:58:51
You should be happy to be in cash. This ship is going to sink and only live because incoming newcomers and dumb money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:07:30
It is happening now. Massive sellout even larger than earlier today.
Our group leader told they are planning saleout targeted around 7000$. But they try to fool as many to have in bitcoins rather than money. So they can push the price down. Then who has bitcoin will be trapped higher and if they want to get into party have to take a loss. Leader told they try to keep price low for couple of weeks so we can buy bitcoin cheap at this level and then push it over 25k$ if we have money left. But first we need to get cheap bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:41:59
If you hold you can not benefit price drop.
If price drops a half you can get twice as many bitcoins back. So it is better to sell and buy back lower = more bitcoins. Holder will put their money on hold.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:08:22
You just made Roger rich.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:34:08
All who bought around 12-15k and followed community HODL strategy are in pain and loss is increasing every minute. I am out.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:01:04
I think game is over, no more sheeps coming into bitcoin market as banks ban credit card transfers to Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:38:30
HODL's butts must hurt so much for now.
