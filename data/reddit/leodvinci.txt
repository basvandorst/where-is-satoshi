That page uses the last 2016 blocks as an estimate. The blockchain.info page is more accurate.

I'll do both because why not.
To make you laugh:
I'm a biologist and will stick to what I know. Let me tell you a bit about the blue-footed booby. The blue-footed booby is a bird that evolved on the Galapagos Islands with only one predator. As a result, it evolved some behavior that you or I would recognize as quite bizarre, though it turns out that this behavior is advantageous in an environment without many predators and without human contact.
The blue-footed booby is named as such for two reasons. The first being that it has blue feet. The other reason the bird got its name is that you can apparently walk up to a blue footed booby and while its on the beach or grass and just sort of pick it up and what the booby will be thinking is that once you finish with him you'll put him back.
To make you feel bad for me:
I bought at 1200.

Regardless it is a bad situation to be in. This idiotic behavior will likely slow adoption.

They won't screw it up permanently. They will mess up the ability to build this better and faster and reduce confidence and limit the protocol. Market solutions should fix the potential problems if anything happens like a 51% attack. The possibility of one is still stagnating.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:13:20
Maybe something to do with concerns about ghash or goxcoins moving.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:26:55
This is not good for the protocol. It is a vulnerability which can be better avoided with things like p2pool. If ghash gains 51 percent expect confidence in btc to go down along with development and price. 
I don't want to see this lose potential due to irresponsible behavior. I would think you would like that as well. There are other zero fee pools (p2pool is the apparent best option) and there isnt any money in the mining contracts.
I would hope you don't want to see bitcoin become a vessel of what it could have been. I am not asking for pitchforks. I just want people to wake the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:32:43
Bitcoin is still in beta. There are probably about 500,000 people to own any significant amount and the technology for the protocol is not especially suited for mas adoption at the moment. This technology is improving and the adoption of multisig by various providers will remove many security concerns.
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:00:02
I think this kind of marketing is counterproductive. It overcorporatizes the protocol. When TCP/ IP was in its infancy mentioning the interwebs sounded like a gimmick. Market this as a valuable protocol because it is one. Obviously do this simply noone wants to hear you rant for hours about the protocol just pique peoples in interest in cryptographic currency protocol by mentioning it briefly and noninvasively. Just avoid the "Got Bitcoin?" marketing strategy.

While I agree with your assessment that he lacks a clear understanding, explain things to him lest he run to r/dogecoin.

We should switch to mbtc for practical purposes who wants to spend .00something on anything and satoshis or Ksts for tipping and micropayments. 
I think there should be a duality there in our understanding of standard units. The mbtc is practical and maintains the currency as something that has value and this practical unit, lets call it a byte, doesnt have to be mbtc just the most practical unit for btc value. If the price dropped to 100 the most practical unit would be cbtc if it went to 100000 it would be ubtc etc. The ksatoshi which we could similarly have a changing appropriate value and term a bit, would be the unit of miner fees in a transaction. This unit would be useful for tipping as it would be small enough not to care about and give away for tips like doge is now. It would be like how we currently think of dollars and cents though with a larger gap for micropayment processing as an association with tips.
The naming system of convention for byte and bit are culturally associated as distinct but related units would make it easy for people to adopt this dual standard and have both be associated with the same currency and distinct values and bit is contained in bitcoin and easily related to the name of the currency.

These kinds of tussles are a problem. Peer to peer digital currency protocol does not need to be corporatized as it has been with either dogecoin or bitcoin.

Aww. Look at my little bitcoin grow up.

It will slow adoption.  I read that last post incorrectly.

Im currently working on a one page flier to summarize what bitcoin is how it works etc and planning on distributing it around my (very large) University. Will upload here when I'm finished with it which will likely be tonight sometime.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:26:08
I agree. People seem to be lacking in common sense however and I feel subsidizing reason may help people act sensibly especially in instances where the alternative is damaging.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:12:50
Take your pick: ghash, goxcoins, silkroadcoins, or the position of the stars.

I hope china bans bitcoin completely already. Im just so sick and tired of this bullshit.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:01:09
My sentiments exactly. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:43:19
Practically, it removes everything bitcoin is. Its really sad to see people make such moronic decisions. I don't trust bitcoin anymore because I have to trust ghash.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:42:21
That link is for the distribution over the past 6 months. 
reveals estimates of hash rate distribution over the past 24 hours.
reveals the history of block discovery.
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:26:13
Agreed. Nothing wrong with being an enthusiast, but professing an innovation as a niche serves to prevent widespread adoption.

You can donate here. 
Unfortunately there are only two donations through this site for today.

I'd guess somewhere around 280 but I think anywhere from 200 to 350 is fairly reasonable. 
This does not really affect my perception of bitcoin as a currency. 
This dip is mostly FUD in the long run and I plan on making money off it- so long as I stay up all night of course. As a long term investment, bitcoin has a value as a decentralized public ledger significantly above the price now and potentially more as a store of value. 
When these things happen in the market, I ask myself one question, and one question only- How can I get more BTC?
 
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:52:30
The estimates for the past 24 hrs put it at 47%. Please donate to p2pool.
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:26:53
Well thank you for clearing that up a bit. Is p2pool really the best possible pool? I have heard it to be less than perfect regardless of fees.

I think it's a little more complicated than that- it's definitely foolishness, but when coupled with the fear that this is actually a ponzi scheme and ignoring the evidence to that effect, it morphs into vehement denialism
