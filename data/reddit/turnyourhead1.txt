There are two definitions of inflation. One is based on value i.e. how much can this buy and is measured with the CPI. The other definition is based on the money supply. This is the old definition and while some commentators like Peter Schiff say this is better its not what most people today mean. The U.S. dollar has increased in quantity vastly since the financial crisis of the late 2000s but its value as measured by the CPI or the billion prices project has barely changed. I would better categorize Bitcoin as behaving like an out of the money option, its very risky, very speculative, it has large upside and downside. If it succeeds it should be deflationary the way gold is deflationary despite increasing in quantity slowly over time.

I don't like the way Twitter has approached the free speech issue on Twitter either but I give him credit here. He says this is Bitcoin and everything is open source and unless and until he goes back on any of that what reason is there not to give him kudos for this one?

I think he means theres only 100 days you couldve bought it for a higher price than you'd pay if you were to buy today.

Id say perhaps that's why he sold bitcoin and kept the bcash but:
    "The move reportedly followed Son receiving a recommendation by a “bitcoin evangelist.” **SoftBank had 
    bought the investment firm of that person earlier in the same year**, the report said. "
Does Ver have an investment firm?
