LOL we aren't a pure capitalist model. Have you heard of our welfare system? That's a social safety net just like the Nordic countries. Sorry we don't have shitty 'universal' healthcare

funny how the swiss are so good with money. i remember this one group of dudes that were like ... REALLY good with money from like 1100-1307... and then something happened and no one really knows where they went. 
but that swiss flag... if you inverse the colors... you will get a symbol that looks like theirs. 
I'll see myself out.

learning about the benefits of communism. As someone who produces and doesn't take from the system, I have no interest in learning how it could 'benefit' me to give more of my money away.
