Just for the record I've only used Coinbase to put in or take out money. I've withdrawn 3 times so far and they took 2,3 and 1 day respectively. I'm wary because I keep seeing these types of posts though.

Can we rename satoshi to bob then? 
I have 58 bits and 40 bobs

I think the last few have been 40-60% so 80% would indeed exceed that.

He'll claim credit for it being his doing or intention. 
EDIT: Somewhat accurate

I'm not sure on good charities but my two best friends died of suicide and cystic fibrosis (separately) when I was 15/16 so I'd personally appreciate any donation to either of those causes.

Not to mention if you're holding before desktop wallet release you generally see a big profit

Generally in crypto we see a retrace of 40-80%. If it hits 20k and then retraces 80% it goes to 4k, that's crazy to even think.

It's given me hope that during he next recession people might lean towards BTC instead of gold. It is alot more accessible and has the same sentiment in it's use.

Don't be sorry, be curious.
Think of it in terms of voting ballots. A node is a vote. Some people are going into the booth and putting more than 1 vote into the box so the vote is skewed tampered with and can't be fully trusted. If someone were to use this vote to validate their point then you know they're full of shit. That's my understanding of the situation at least.

Plenty of cryptocurrencies based around using a card.

I've been researching this and I've even commented it a few times but I'm starting to really believe that during the next recession BTC will be on par or outperform gold. Easier to invest in, easier to use day to day, easier to cash out. All the economic trouble in Venzuela and a few other countries ( how BTC surged in them) only strengthen my belief.
Recessions occur on average every 8.5 years so we're overdue one by 2 or 3 years and it's going to be worse than before because they bailed everyone out rather than starting again. Housing is worse than ever and debt per household is rediculous right now.

Yes, the ridiculous prices. In my countries capital for example, houses have risen €20,000 a month in price. 1-5% of it's value a month!

It'll definitely have a pull back, hard to say how much. I'd wager over 50% though, don't go buying a house for a few years.

Gold prices generally rise during a recession as it's a store of value. I'm saying BTC might just perform similarly this time around.

When you go Bank to bank, at least where I'm from, the fee is roughly the same unless you have a student account and it takes a day + to get confirmed.
On weekends contactless payments are fully processed until the next working day.
You're right that it's not there yet but BTC is in it's infancy still (well more like a toddler) and because it's tech based it is much more easily improved and updated.
