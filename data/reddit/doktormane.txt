Very nicely put. Summed up perfectly. The block chain technology has tons of potential but scammers and speculators are on the verge of destroying it.

Where? In am new in crypto currency and I want to buy Bitcoin anonymously , as it was intended. I am asking a real question. PM me if needed 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:22
Check your math

Take the pizza example and apply it to anything. If it fluctuates so wildly, it is just not feasible to use it to make regular purchases. Imagine if I had spent 1 bitcoin last year when it was 700 to buy a video card. I would now have a video card for which I paid 8000k. Would that not bother you? I see Bitcoin useful for speculation but not savings.

I have money invested in stocks, bonds (via mutual fund) and real estate (apartment that I own). How I am the non-investing type?
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:34:40
Those are the issues with bitcoin . If you bother to read the corresponding paragraph you will read the concise point. There is too much volatility that will hinder it's real world use. This is a concise point that I made. How do you counter this specific argument regarding the volatility? You know that some guy bought two pizzas with millions of dollars right? What if I buy a pair of shoes for the equivalent of millions of future dollars? Well, people won't based on that precedent.
Further questions for you: when will it stabilise ? How will it stabilise? The world economy values stability and not volatility .

This is to date the single most to the point and honest answer that I have received! But what if people lose their trust in Bitcoin ? People trust gold because it is something tangible that is hard to extract and people have fought literal wars over it ( hence the historical perspective ). Its value based on this is very ingrained in our collective memory .
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:38:56
Im not trying to be condescending in any way, that is why I said that it is too easy to offend Bitcoin owners. I am simply stating some concerns , which are backed by examples and arguments and see what the possible answers might be. I would gladly put my hard earned dollars into it if I am convinced
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:45:29
I can't disagree with your comment because I am not looking to gamble , I am not looking for sure bets either but I need to believe in what I am putting my money into. Whether that is education , buying stocks in a company, or giving money to a startup.
Thanks for being civil about it though and not being offended! :) I got a lot of hate today with my post 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:58:24
Choose any paragraph I wrote and counter it. Instead of of the thinly veiled attack actually read what I said about speculation, volatility and the fact that it might be a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:11:57
I get the whole idealistic, anarchic approach of trying ton tackle income inequality but please tell me how you link that to Bitcoin directly. How you use Bitcoin to directly do that. If you tell people to buy Bitcoin (if they find the money that is) how will you guarantee it to them that the value will keep increasing? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:01:17
Thanks for the civilized reply!
My pizza argument is that I am very unlikely to use Bitcoin to buy a pizza now knowing that it can triple it's value by the time I'm finished eating. That naturally deters people from using Bitcoin ,doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:45:55
There might be a language barrier because you are implying that they were finding gold on the ground ( which is actually found in ore in the mountains and a small percentage in rivers) and using it immediately to trade .
The all or nothing approach is what is worrying me. There are just two sides, the strong believers and the disbelievers which is too extreme in my opinion to create stability for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:48:26
Dude come on, I thought you had something for me. The whole point is convenience. I don't have the time to look for people on Craigslist. the answer is obviously an exchange but now that everything is mainstream the government is trying to regulate it and make it harder to launder money and stay anonymous therefore going against what Bitcoin stood for
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:49:09
Well they switched to monero apparently once Bitcoin became too visible .like seriously I need to send a copy of my ID to buy Bitcoin off an exchange. Anonymity my ass
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:52:48
No worries buddy. Thanks for being civil about it. I have gotten so much rage today for a thread that I started asking some critical questions ....
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:56:35
Yes but we're talking gold which is only one. I cannot create LiteGold, AltGold, BitGold or any other gold alternative. With all of the hundreds of other crypto currency flooding the market , how will we choose the "good one"? Especially people with little tech knowledge 
And plus, were talking here about a resource that had very widely used real world applications such as in jewelry and electronics as gold is a very good electrical conductor.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:59:43
Thinking of it as an "unbreakable religion" certainly isn't going to change my mind.
 And your other answers are vague. What is "human nature " and how do you know when someone is knowledgeable in it?
What are the in depth psychological needs that Bitcoin will fullfil in people? 
What aspect of the old financial order are people most angry with? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:26:19
Read the TL;DR
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:34:50
Yes but you didn't answer my question . Gold is the a standard because it is unique and impossible to replicate. With the hundreds of crypto currency on the market, how do we know which one will be the new gold standard ? 
At the moment the only value ascribed to Bitcoin is based on it's perceived future value and not current usefulness 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:03:29
But that what is going on by being hyped so much. It will blow up before it can show the world that it has potential. I see people with absolutely no clue about the basics invest thousands because "they heard it's gonna get big".
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:37:59
The whole relax and ride it out doesn't work for people who work for a living and are looking to actually invest thousands, like me. That is one of my points, it's too late to invest 200$ and turn it into thousands and the ones who are netting a lot are the ones speculating with very large a amounts. If I had 500k I would definitely let it loose for a couple of hours to bank some thousands in the process. But what I am seeing is people investing hard earned money as a long term investment, which I am doubtful of, reason for which I turned to Reddit to have some things discussed 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:07:00
I really agree with you. See the thread that I started. 
It is in a bubble and it is just too volatile to be used for everyday purchases. If you bought a pizza with bitcoin the pizza might be worth triple by the time you finished eating it. Currency needs stability .
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:17:27
Care to elaborate why?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:04:38
I feel I am not alone thinking this anymore. And I agree that they are actively  trying to surprise negative publicity by any means. They even went after Warren Buffet after he expressed doubt in Bitcoin. Warren .freaking Buffett. Ive been really negatively surprised by the way they talk about this. :( 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:12:15
Buddy that's on you. Just read the whole thing so you get some context and arguments. Make a counter and tell me why do you think that I am wrong. I don't take anything personally so don't be afraid to offend me.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:59:21
And I don't argue that bubbles don't happen or that they can't be profitable but I see this ending badly for people who aren't "on the inside" and think it will keep growing forever.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:54:39
I don't think there was a period when you could literally pick it up off the ground. They used to say that during the gold Rush when the real people who made money were the ones selling the shovels. But as you said, there were thousands of years that took for gold to become what it is today and it was a mix of a lot of things that had to be just right. I just don't think Bitcoin will become what people say it will become but it's hard to argue when the price is 8k per coin. Everybody is blinded by this and they don't want to even accept that there might be another ending to this story.  I hope things will be good , obviously because I have also bought some out of fear of missing out but I consider that money long gone. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:02
Check your math. He said he wanted to invest 1000 dollars when it was 12 dollars a piece. He would have had 830 thousand 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:29:06
The way Bitcoin is describe sounds very similar to how MLMs are described by their adopters. Revolutionary, brand new never before seen, THEY don't what you to know about it. The fact that a lot of Bitcoin owners get very personally offended when challenged, speak in rhetoric and cherry pick arguments is what worries me.  They act like they're in cult and they know the true Truth and everybody else are idiots for not believing .
Either you believe what they believe or you don't exist to them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:42:50
Since you already deleted your comment let me post the reply to that regardless:
My comment was a metaphor for the volatility of the currency. sure in small amounts fluctuations in the exchange rate won't matter but try it with thousands and you'll see why volatility is an no-no for real investors and attractive on the other hand for speculators 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:48:43
Thanks for the reply. I believe in the power of the block chain technology behind it. No doubt, it solves the double spending problem, among other things and it has real potential. But what if we are all buying Bitcoin when in fact we all should have been buying INSERTNAMEHEREcoins all this time? What gives Bitcoin the power to monopolise right?  I heard it had a real problem with liquidity so if a lot of people decide to cash in, things are not gonna look good.
