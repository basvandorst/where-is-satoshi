I see your point.  I see a dividing line in age with regard to BTC.  It seems that BTC is a young mans "game".. Ask anyone over 45 what they know about BTC and you will most likely see that most in that age bracket have no idea what it is.  
Edit:  just saw that Winkelvoss twins just launched Winkdex. .. I do believe that these two young geniuses will manipulate prices and ultimately for their own gain.  Not much different than the old farts manipulating the banking system.

2-  Nuclear Medicine / B.S. Nuclear Medicine ~ MBA
3-  Yes.  has already outperformed my expectations... I was looking into BTC last year when it was at about $80 and thought that if it were to double within a year it would be worthwhile... well it MORE THAN doubled even with the negative press and the goxxing.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:02:26
awesome! good luck guys!

I like it. Its clever.  I would cast a gold coin and engrave yadda yadda yadda...

So according to this paper, if the theory is true, we are in the "confusion" stage.  2014 is going to be the breakout year for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:36:41
324 people voted... hmmm I guess they speak for the rest of the world.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:57:01
Did you steal the coins or are you an incompetant? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:48:36
"carbon footprint"? really?! Are we starting this nonsense again? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:57:42
Because at the moment the BTC has value that can still be legally traded for fiat.  Once outlawed the FBI can not legally convert or spend.   Unlike drugs that cannot be converted to anything...

I like your guess!

I added this link to promote hometown businesses that accept bitcoin. I live in Round rock and found this article and set up the link. I did it for community pride and to promote businesses that accept bitcoin. I'm sorry that I wasnt quick enough for you to add to your site. CalvinHouse is not trolling. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:29:30
hahaha...no Obamacare cinched it for me!  Its funny but I'll bet that the US government SPENDS or LIQUIDATES the large cache they took from silk road before they decide to outlaw.... So look out for that liquidation... then watch out for them to outlaw.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:26:15
....something about a tin hat?...
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:11:26
Very interesting article. For business owners contemplating accepting BTC these are very important topics to consider.

human interface improvement.  I am a supporter of bitcoin but lets face it...its not very easy or convenient for the average person to adopt and use cryptos. there needs to be a platform or interface to make the process easy and secure. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:11:20
You need to come up with the next "facebook" for BTC. an easy platform that allows all users to make transactions with minimal effort. maybe a platform that would be usable accross multiple coins.  Ok, I readdly dont know what is is we need....but it seems like we need "something" to tie it all together. I know...i'm babbling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:40:30
marketplace with only 5 products to sell? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:45:28
Just what we need... the "petulant child" of cryptocurrency. will it be called "Brat-coin"?

What about hobby mining? So many people mining on simple rigs and earning pennies. Whats the point of tracking that income?
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:36:45
Lost or indefinitely held? How would you be able to know the difference?  In my case its both... My first wallet is stored on a computer that crashed and it holds about $80~90 worth of BTC. but I'm just holding onto it until I have the time and money to have the computer data restored. Now if by chance that computer gets thrown out then its lost forever. But for now I consider it a "hold". My second wallet just keeps growing as i havent spent ANY of my BTC.  
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:21:09
exactly! no different from any other reality show... but get one good character and it would be watched... 
The Duck Dynasty guys make duck calls. but they brought their culture to the mainstream pretty quick
just sayin...if done right with and entertaining it would be a great way to get mainstream america to get into BTC

I purchased through localbitcoins and had a very positive experience.  The sellers are also trying to legitimize the whole BTC experience and gain positive reputations themselves. At least that was the conversation I had with my seller.  We met over coffee and completed the entire transaction in person.  We sat together and talked until the transaction was verified.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:55:06
agreed ...  a little surprised at some of the harsh comments from this community.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:21:57
you enjoy your freedoms today beause of our great military.  you dont have to support our troops...thats ok. They will still protect your freedoms.  Do please continue to enjoy your freedoms (including freedom of speech) courtesy of our heroic American troops. Good day to you =-)

@_date: 2014-01-14 21:35:58
I think its a healthy plateau.  The BTC price needed to correct and stabalize from $1200 high.  Keeping in the $820-$850 range and keeping stable for now is a good thing.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:38:32
Keys "lost by accident"? .... lost by incompetance? ..... or is this really just part of the Karpeles scam to steal BTC? 
I have a hard time with the notion that the keys were "lost"...or that this is a convenient case of incompetance.  I smell a RAT!
edit: a BIG RAT

So you say that supporting our troops makes me a lost cause? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:27:47
it was concerning to me too. HOWEVER it will give BTC legal legitamacy within the US

@_date: 2014-03-03 17:36:40
I had the same thought a few months back! Its the reason I will always keep at least 1 BTC
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:58:33
I've held that price point for a few weeks and didnt think it would really drop to that extent. Looks like its rebounding now.  I just want to take advantage of cheap coins.

you painted with such a broad stroke..just wated to clarify a bit.  You love Obamacare but hate the military...both of whom are lead by Obama. So you dislike his leadership in the military but love his leadership on healthcare? Any reason you hate the military so much?

@_date: 2014-01-29 19:47:21
thats a pretty big gamble. I'm bullish in the long run, BUT there is always the chance that BTC will collapse if too many economic superpowers decide to outlaw.  Of course on the flip side you could end up a Bitcoin Billoinaire.

I just learned to skip the muck and read things I find helpful.  You will learn a lot and keep up with the latest events surrounding the growth of bitcoin.  With everyone free to exchange their ideas, of course you will hear some people bitching.  Just as you are bitching now about this sub.  Its ok.  The people will downvote as necessary.  
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:20:06
I dont think we will see the increases we did in 2013.  I believe that it will hover within the $800-$900 range for the next couple of months then end the year at around $1200.  The next real increases will occur in 2015.  But that is just my own speculations.

It seems that it was a debaucle the entire time.  He never had control of the exchange.  Incompetent, liar and did not know how to run his business.  After all begins to fail... why not come up with an exit strategy that makes you a multi-millionaire? 
He is obviously a RAT and I would not put it past him to find a way to keep the coin.

@_date: 2014-02-20 01:43:17
To be fair though...bitcoins are manipulated by young smart men who are also manipulating the system behind closed doors. Mt gox...Winkelvoss twins... and maybe even Satoshi himself? What other young geniuses are out there right now figuring out a way to manipulate the system? 
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:07:46

If I understand this correctly...bitcoin is now the same as gold (bars, coins).. It is considered "property".  I can sell someone property as a private citizen and not be subject to sales tax.  But as a business I would now have to charge a sales tax?       
Are exchanges in the US to be considered retailers?
