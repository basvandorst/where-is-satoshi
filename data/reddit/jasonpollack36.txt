So basically their users are forced to sell Bitcoins in order to withdraw, which will lead to artificial temporary selling pressure. Good time to load up. I think around $500 is a good buying point.

Right, there are a lot of crazy risky ETFs. And we have had 8 years when risk have been swiped under the carpet (by means of QE), but it didn't go anywhere, just accumulates for the big boom to come.

I think the consensus currently is that ETF won't be approved. So if it will be approved, it will be a big surprise, with significant consequences for the price.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:29:39
That, and also an ETF can be bought by tax exempt accounts like IRAs and 401k.

Most merchants accept bitcoin through bitpay or other conversion service, so if bitpay starts accepting other currencies, merchants will accept them automatically.

I would LOVE if IRS treats transfer into Coinbase as buy at current market price. I bought at MtGox for $11 in 2011, transferred to Coinbase in 2014 and immediately sold for $450. I actually paid maximum taxes with basis = $0 because I know I can't get any tax docs from MtGox. Time to amend that tax return and get a nice refund ...
