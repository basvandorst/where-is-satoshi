�� I just trying to find more ways how to hide it for future. Seems like for the sending payments to someone wasabi is okay. For the store of value just none kyc exchanges are good

Does samurai mixing addresses in the same way as wasabi ?

It will not work. The tx history of known address is already known to that folks. They will see that I transferred to exchange and withdraw it to the new address.

But exchanges address is still the same when I bought back in a days and nowadays. The exchanges address hasn’t changed at all

Yeah I used only one address. Just created the new one, and sent BTC to wasabi. Then will do a coinjoin and will send to the new created address right ?

I just need to send my BTC to wasabi wallet and then back to that one what I have? Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:06:59
Thanks, already found. By the way It is very easy process
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:24:48
Yeah, thanks for recommendation. I have already created a new address and sent to wasabi. By the way what the difference between wasabi and samurai?
