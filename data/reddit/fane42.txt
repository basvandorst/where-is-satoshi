Yes I did indeed say those things, may I ask what your point is? You have been reported because of disruptive behavior in case you were curious.
Also some mod mail OP has chosen not to share:
to kiisfm from angrypotato1 [+1][M] via sent 28 minutes ago:
You broke rule 1.
to angrypotato1 from kiisfm [-2] via sent 26 minutes ago:
Go kill yourself fraud
This kind of language is very concerning while we are trying to have a civilized discussion.

This is very intriguing, do you mind posting the link to the line chart if you have it available?
Ninja Edit: Also my responses are being delayed because OP is down-voting my comments.

was a valued member of the mod team for the short time he was a part of it. Not unlike what happens to other newly started subreddits, felt that he was too occupied with personal commitments to continue being a useful part of the mod team. Hopefully this dispels any confusion caused by his abrupt exit.
Thank you,

Do you care to elaborate on why this is so?

Never mind, apparently this has been discussed between the mods before, thank you none the less for wanting to help.

Dear readers of this post, I ask you to read this before commenting or responding to this users post.
I am a moderator of the subreddit As has stated, he was indeed banned for reasons which are unclear to me. If one wishes to know why, they may want to contact another moderator.
Comments have been censored for reasons which OP has not specified. Mostly because they are non-constructive and annoy other users of the subreddit. 
I'm afraid I am unsure what OP means when they say "the creator had similar patterns to the winner" however I feel I must say that the randomization was flawed in the first draw and will be changed drastically by the next draw. 
As for "the random choice was mockery", I have addressed this above.
Kind Regards,
Fane42
