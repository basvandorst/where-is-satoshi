We crash from 1 mil down to 100k, briefly touching 85k at the lowest. Same story every-time where the fudders say that this time will be different, that bitcoin can't possibly recover from a drop that big. A lot of those fudders shoot themselves in 2030 when it crosses 10 mil and the network starts to stabilize in growth with the pool becoming to big for anyone to manipulate as they are able to do in these early days.

Yes, it's already around in your time, though it doesn't get released to the public for a couple more decades. The current government is too afraid to trust the public with such tech, not till they're replace by aging out does this information finally get allowed to enter the commercial sector.

In the future it is used to communicate with the past. Post like those of Luke Magana were made by these methods. A lot of post on reddit are often times people from the future interacting with the past. Though it is illegal to do so in the future, hackers find a way to do it anyway. Many in my time have made millions making a comment in the past that gets a crypto donation they can collect in there time.

Yes, gold and silver grow way to slow for any operation like this to be worthwhile. In the future gold and silver get devalued too once our civilization figures out meteor mining increasing the supply of gold deluding it's value. Great for technology though as those precious metals become cheap enough to create technological marvels that would cost way to much today to make it to consumers, like motherboards made with full gold pathways for faster speed instead of the small amounts they have today because of the gold price, or batteries that have gold barriers for faster recharge and output capability that today would make batteries unaffordable to most people.

Big cities oddly enough end up being the safest places statistically(LA, OC, NY, Colorado, ect.), somewhere preferably near police station. Most investors who get robbed or killed live out in rural areas, making it easier for people to operate a robbery without any help near enough to arrive on-time. There was a famous one 2 years ago from your time now where 2 billionaires were tortured and killed. What the news didn't say is that they were tortured for their cold storage wallet keys. Even in my time the coins taken from them were never traced to the people who robbed them. Many more cases like this happen from now till my time. So moral of the future history is, don't seclude yourself away from civilization where it makes it easier for these thieves to make you a rural area target. Get yourself some big dogs too like Pitbulls and a good security system. Most people who get robbed had no dogs that could've detoured the thieves from targeting them.

it already did, and will again late 2019 before surging into the next bubble past 100k. After that the next drop will be around 20k in 2020, briefly touching 17k and even 15k on some exchanges before starting the next slow climb back up. Be ready for fud being marketed by the whales at that time saying this is different than all other drops, that BTC can not possibly recover dropping from 100k to 20k just like they're saying today. They never stop marketing this tactic to create fud as it continues to work for them every-time to shake off new investors.

Sadly he does, the antiTrump press gets him the same free media he got in 2016. Although this is good for crypto.

.2 is more than you will need. the 1% of my time on average only hold .25 btc. Hold onto that and you'll be fine. I'd ditch the dragonchain though and move into something like litecoin. In the future everyone finds out litecoin is the test platform for bitcoin, anything they plan on btc they do to litecoin first making it a part of the core btc group family. Also, with the halving happening to ltc this month, the growth it has after that makes it one of the most profitable coins this year. I can't give exact price ranges as this timeline appears to be slightly off of mine. But just hold onto those for 10 years if you can and you will never have to work again. Never spend your btc either, spend the alts when the time comes. Let the btc grow.

Mostly online as you see today, using media to destabilize public trust in government and corporations. I wouldn't say that's a bad thing though, less trust in those who govern you is always a good thing. Questioning everything is how you end up knowing more than you were suppose too.

2025 was when I first started traveling back, currently from 2028 with btc bubbling over 50mil+, expected to break 100 mil before the bubble pops back down to 10 mil. 
The banking system adopts it's own international crypto currency in attempts to compete called IDMT, or International and digital money tender. It's the most used in modern times, and bitcoin is rare but valuable in equivalence to how gold is only held by the rich today.
Bitcoin is mostly held by early adopters and traded for IDMT for everyday purchases, but used for property purchases without conversion for the most part. Conversion is done for daily purchases as to hide users wallets and not reveal how much they hold, preventing from making themselves a target to people monitoring every day vendor purchases. 
They have been buying heavily in 2018, calculating purchases to be just under the amounts being sold so they could accumulate while still bringing the price down with the FUD they have been causing, the more they scared people into selling, the more they we're able to buy without raising the price. This allows them to survive the transition and become the biggest holders in the future, the most prominent one being Amazon, with Space-X right behind them. 
The biggest exchanges we have are currently a tie between binance and coinbase, coinbase with mostly institutional investors, and binance at an equivalent value being the exchange most non institutional investors use. Binance by far has way more investors than coinbase number wise, but the type of investors coinbase has keeps them at a constant race of passing each other up for the most valued exchanges in our time.  We don't see this changing anytime soon, we call the race the exchange of the people vs the exchange of the corporations. 
Look for 2.5k to make your big moves, though I'd advise still making small moves on the way down to 2.5 as it is a brief period we see this and buying it will be astronomically hard even with programed limit buys. You'll be competing with the biggest corporations and whales all trying to swoop up 100's of billions of dollars worth at this value point quickly swooping out of reach from normal non institutional investors. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:56:38
Banks eventually combine efforts to form the IDMT or  International and digital money tender, they develop apps and move away from physical locations to survive. It becomes the most used currency in the future with bitcoin being held mostly by the rich like gold is today. The rich only use IDMT for everyday purchases to hide their wallets identities from people tracking daily purchases, preventing themselves from becoming targets. While bitcoin is mainly used directly for property purchases. Their wallets value become their credit for being allowed to make such purchases.  
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:58:04
That was a government traveler from a country who went defunct. They never even traveled to the past, instead they used a quantum entangled connection to transmit code in order to make the post. Idiot move on their part, they gave the other governments over 20 years to track them down and shut down their cable cutting before it happened. They also severely altered the timeline though with how visible their post became. From what they describe, bitcoin was the prominent used currency in their future and banks went away. Because of their post the banks had enough time to prepare and create and implement their own crypto-currency, forking the future to the one I come from.  While ours seems similar, bitcoin is more of the gold of my time only held by the rich instead of the defacto world currency. IDMT is the one a majority of the world uses for exchange. Pointless currency in my opinion since it's still subject to a 2% yearly inflation. But it helps not expose the wallets of those who use it at least when they convert to it for daily purchases.

Sorry I don't follow sports and did not look this up before coming back here. We have to avoid betting on sports as we could take money meant for others and make changes to the timeline that might reveal our operations to governments doing their own travels. As far as we know, we are one of the few, if not the only private chrononaut operation in our time. The rest are all government operations who claim to only do so for historical study proposes, though many of us who are aware of them doubt these claims. We stay out of their way and avoid their detection as to avoid being noticed and shut down. We supply them with tech for their operations, and that's the extent of their perception of us so far. Travel by non government bodies is strictly banned, only time they legally allow us to do so is when a billionaire pays them for a vacation and they contract us to do so, even then we are accompanied by government agents who monitor and report every aspect of those trips. So these non sanctioned trips must be kept under raps and untied from the corporations that own the operations we run.

I said he missed his bet by a year. BTC doesn't reach 1 million till late 2021, 2020 is a bubble burst year where it dips to 15k briefly, but 20k more accurately from 100k. 2020 will be my next stop when I return. I'll attempt to make a new post by then.

2020 is a bubble pop year, btc started the year down at around 87k from 100k, ands the year in the 20k region, while briefly dipping to 17k, and even 15k on some exchanges. GE stays in business too, they're one of the companies quietly accumulating during these down times setting themselves up to be saved in the future. Companies like them in my time are largely attributed to creating the fud to bring the price down giving them better buying opportunities on every bubble pop. However they're not the biggest, the biggest quiet buyers are Amazon and Space-X
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:06:31

There's no anti fud attempt here as most will downvote this as they have been subliminally programed too, keeping it from mass visibility safely allowing the timeline to stay intact. Lightning adoption starts picking up next year, though still slow, it will take another 10 years for it to spread to most physical vendors like credit cards did. Online vendors will mostly be integrated within the next 5 years which is a catalyst that causes physical vendors to begin adopting.

Exactly that. Picking up too much at one point would take away amounts other important people were meant to buy so they could further the project. If we take that away from them, then they could possibly not have enough coins to move forward; killing the project all together. We buy based on what an A.I D-wave run program tells us, which calculates what we can buy while still keeping the project alive.

We still don't know in our time. Doubtful though since A.I's we're still in basic stages in 2008. Most evidence we've gathered points towards rogue members of the N5A creating it to have their own fund to rival the C1A after they witnessed the C1A's blackwater funds cause the 2006-2008 recession after tracing it stealing funds from banks to run their own operations. The biggest evidence we find towards this is how powerless the C1A has become in our time due to crypto taking power and killing the value of fiat currencies, even the fiat cryptocurrency the banks make to try and compete, the IDMT, or International and digital money tender.^^^MispelledToAvoidAlgorithmicDetection

If you have the money to pay for the guards that will protect you. Their government and law enforcement are not the most efficient even in my time, and leave many vulnerable to kidnappings &amp; robberies. Your safest bet is somewhere like the US or Canada, where crooks are less bold as they have to stay under the radar of their hawk eyed justice departments. Biggest rule is just to not put yourself in a rural area where you become an easy target with help being too far away to reach you in time. Safest bet is a big city near a police department with big dogs and a good security system. You want to make yourself as much as an unattractive candidate for robbery as possible.
