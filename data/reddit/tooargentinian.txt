People taking his comment literal are making me cringe.

How would it be expensive? And for whom?
If I have 10 bitcoins that I bought at $270.00 USD, they re-enable, you're saying that the price will soar to $1k so they'd pay that much for each one of my bitcoins? 
This sounds very unlikely. Or maybe I'm not understanding very well.

This is the most reasonable comment I've seen in several months.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:50:19
Ha! You're most right. It is definitely a gamble.
But I'm curious on the effect of the aftermath of this, and I wanted to hear other bitcoiners opinions.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:53:38
So you've done this as we speak? I mean recently?
This sounds like a huge loophole, it seriously sound like a money making machine, how come is not everyone doing this?
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:31:10
Don't know why you had zero points on this comment, here, back to one, I think you make a fair point. A lot of people just downvote anything that's not 100% pro-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:18:35
I see, thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:46:00
This is what I thought it might happen, even though I'd love to believe that prices would stabilize or go up, like a lot of users are saying, I think the logical outcome is this.

I lost it with Dorian and his bizarre and elaborate ploy
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:47:39
Thankfully I don't, but I can help to entertain the possibility that some people that do believe in Gox might be able to make a lot of money out of this issue.

I love the tech around bitcoin, I think its revolutionary in many senses, there's nothing more I'd want in the world than for it to succeed. That said, what you just wrote is closer to reality than most of the things I read in this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:32:20
Hahaha, what are you doing man, -2,393 comment karma, do you get high on negative karma? haaha, thanks for the good laugh.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:44:08
This is what sounds more logic to me. This would also prompt me to sell the bitcoins I have on other exchanges, but I strongly believe that bitcoin is the future and won't give it up unless it's worthless, at which point I wouldn't give it up anyways because it would be worthless. ha!
Also I don't think that if it never opens it will forever niche, one exchange failed, that doesn't mean that the technology is not amazing.

Not necessarily "people" down-voting you, reddit has an algorithm that adds downvotes to compensate for and prevent spam.
I agree with you on every point regarding coinbase. I use it just as a way of buying my regular bitcoins every couple weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:59:11
This is true, not sure why you got downvoted, back to one my friend.

Honestly, I'd rather have the nonsense of than the aristocratic pedantic The way any sort of discussion about alternatives was silenced has no excuse, and should not be tolerated when we are talking about open source.
Openness to even non-expert and small contributors is a fundamental part of it, which was here met as laughable silly attempts at solutions about an issue they "know nothing about",  That's what bothered me the most. 
I'm disappointed with the fact that what I thought was the much awaited solution to world problems, turned into the toy of some l33t of developers. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:33:35
I think you may have forgotten the /s, if that was indeed non sarcastic then I welcome it, and look forward to more productive arguments and discussions.
Otherwise it's just proof of what I meant by pedantic aristocracy. And the problem is that exactly that is what will prevents systems from acknowledging ideas that might seem radical at first but are revolutionary in the end(like Bitcoin).
I love this technology and what it means, I want it to see it solve the problems it was born to solve.

I was under the impression that Bitcoin was an open source project. Not only that, the fundamentals behind it were to allow the banking of the un-banked by providing a decentralized non-fee ability to send value.
Most importantly it is free and open for everyone to participate, your comment, and everything on this subreddit is directed at not allowing discourse with what could be other options, you don't allow people who are not "absolute experts" to even participate in the conversation, just like our government, just against everything that Bitcoin stood against one time.
I am concerned now not so much about the technology, I know the people behind it are great, but they are by no means the only ones and the best. I can assure you there are millions of engineers who could replace them in a heart beat if they'd found it compelling and interesting. I am concerned about it not being free and open for everyone, I'm concerned about censorship, I'm concerned at not allowing other people to propose options and just shooting them down and silencing because they don't fit your agenda. 
Honestly I've dealt with Startup aristocracy before and I find it revolting, it's so funny that now it's a part of Bitcoin.
Open the door to discussion, stop promoting your own agenda as the only valid one and guide people who want to collaborate so they can become active. Isn't that one of the fundamentals of open source?

Please do not compare this to our current monetary system. The 2MB change is just a quick solution to a real problem. No one said Core should stop working on segwit or lightning network.

I guess that's the end of the argument. Again [Godwin's Law]( proves itself.
