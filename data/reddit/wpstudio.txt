You can't be a "whistleblower" unless you provide evidence.  Where's the details?  Where's the proof?

Anyone else notice the whole site seems "off centered"... the top nav bar is off with the orange stripe.  And the featured image on the home page is pulled off to the left because of the text.

Oh and holy smokes the mobile version is horrible.  Roger should ask for his money back.
And user interaction gets even worse... Try visiting the news area and tell me how to get back to the homepage through a link?  You can't.  You are stuck.  (but then again the home page is really bad so maybe this is a benefit... once you are in you can't get out)

Luke you really don't know what you are talking about do you... Maybe read a little, learn a little and the world might surprise you.

Wow a downvote for posting something Gavin asked to happen during the MIT Bitcoin Expo this morning.  Okay.

Be careful... linking to this on HashTalk will get you banned.  Multiple people have been banned already just for sharing the CoinDesk article.

Yeah, I logged back in after a while and found 577+ BTC on my account.  Really wished it was true.
