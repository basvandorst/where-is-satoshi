You could get an account with the german fidor bank and then use it to transfer euros to kraken. Should only take a couple minutes to do the transfer, after it's set up. Kraken isn't really good for trading lately as it crashes all the time, etc. Might be ok if you just want to buy and hold.

What the fuck is wrong with the support agent's English? If I encountered that I'd immediately think it's some kind of scam. How retarded are they when they can't even get people who can speak English with all the price gouging they do. High time someone actually competent took their market share.

The fee is 0.25% for all kinds of trades. Other exchanges have lower fee (like 0.15%) for market makers (limit orders). So if you lose e.g. 0.1% more each time you trade, and your trade volume is e.g. 10 BTC a month, you'll pay 0.01 BTC more in fees compared to different exchange. At a BTCUSD rate of 15000, that's 150 dollars more in trading fees.
Ignoring the cheaper fees for high volume accounts for simplicity.

Not really. Gevers is not following the foundation charter. He goes to conferences to speak about his failed scam startup Monetas while being the Tezos Foundation president. Doesn't mention Tezos at all, or as a failure. Promises to compensate people organizing community events, then ignores them. Doesn't pay the dev team. Doesn't fund ecosystem development. He has until tomorrow to name a new foundation board member. Then the Swiss foundation authorities will name someone else instead and that's game over for him.

I don't know the English keywords you need to google, but it's essentially a company that exchanges currency in large amounts, and can give you a better rate than a bank or TransferWise.
Usually it will work with only a few 
pairs of currencies relevant to the country they operate in (e.g. the one I know only has EUR, USD and GBP and the local currency). It's likely that they will ask you to print, sign, scan and send them back a contract before you can use them, I guess that's too much hassle for some people and they use things like TransferWise instead.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:27:13
Yea, Kraken sucks dicks. Their fucking website makes you log in 3 times and try 10 times before you even get to the screen where you need to be, then it crashes or something and you can start over.

Really? Show me a scam that started with the scammer telling everyone how he plans to scam them. Even if there were a "history of scams with bitcoin services", what does it imply? Your sentence doesn't even make sense. The majority of scams that happened were the service founder running off with everyone's money. Do you see this guy claiming to have some magical way to create money, or even asking people for money?
Furthermore, if it's so easy to facilitate double spending, pretending it doesn't exist and attacking people who are showing that it in fact can work is probably the worst thing you can do. Telling him to stop doing it is retarded, because guess what, someone else will do it anyway and they won't tell you.

Mainly because they are late to the party. If they released HotS before Dota 2, they would have as good chance as anyone. But now all the people who played DotA switched to Dota 2 and they have no reason to play HotS. HotS may even be profitable, but it will be like any other Dota clone (LoL is the only successful one thanks to the huge playerbase), only casuals will play it. Even HoN, which was the only modern dota-like for quite a while could only retain a fraction of their playerbase.
