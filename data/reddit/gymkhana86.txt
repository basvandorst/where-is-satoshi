They don't need to know that you own it. If you didn't, you would just delete the text. 2FA is a bare minimum level of protection for an account. Use it.

Isn't it interesting how we are trying to create something outside of the realm of the centralized banking system, and yet still, it entirely depends on the centralized banking system?

Can someone please explain to me how an exchange is FDIC insured? That is almost like someone saying, if you lose money on your stocks, the FDIC will pay you back? I'm lost.

I'll probably get a "thatsthejoke.jpg" here, but I like the fact that he is playing with blocks, lol...

That doesn't answer the question. If I lose my wallet at KFC, the guy who finds it gets my money. Or if he's an honest guy, returns it. 
Others have answered already however. I understand the subdivision of bitcoin a bit better now.

HODOR! I mean HODL!

Right, I get that. But that then subtracts those from the 21 million or however many total, right? So what if all the bitcoin or a large portion of it were lost this way? Not enough bitcoin to go around? Price of each bitcoin increases because there is less supply? Still curious.

Why do you say this? Seriously curious, not sarcastic. Please explain.

Newb question: What happens to a bitcoin if you lose your hardware wallet, or if you forget your code, or say, lose your HDD that you had stored them on? Do those coins become available to others to "mine" again? If there is a finite number of bitcoins, then what is the plan for recreating those that are "lost" by various means?
