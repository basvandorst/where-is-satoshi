It’s a really valid point. Even in traditional investment circles it would not be advised to pay off the mortgage. Your return on investment is the interest rate which is 4%-5%. Instead OP could invest the cash in a mixture of index funds and bonds and earn more over the long haul. Home equity doesn’t really put your money to work, even though it’s emotionally nice to be free and clear of debt.

Actually in a way a paid off house does bind you. Let’s say it’s worth $300k. Now you just have $300k sitting in the home, unable to grow at a decent rate relative to other traditional investments. This is the case with the current low interest rates. If your mortgage is 4% and inflation averages 3%, you are much better off getting the mortgage and investing your cash instead. Of course, this is just the numbers, not the mental and emotional aspect. Some people like to be free and clear of everything which I respect.

All investments have risk, but you can reduce your risk by having a very diverse portfolio with index funds and bonds, and also using a buy and hold strategy. Crashes like the dot com and 2008 recession are just temporary bumps in the road. Someone investing for the long haul who isn't actively trading simply rides out the crashes and things average out. 
A 5% mortgage would be a toss up, because you are correct, that 5% is basically guaranteed. But a 15 year fixed is like 3.5% right now. Accounting for inflation that's basically free-money. I would absolutely take that mortgage and dump my cash into a diversified portfolio. But at the end of the day risk preference is up to each person.

To get to the point where you can invest those regular monthly mortgage payments, you would have to "invest" $300k into the mortgage. The return on that investment is the interest rate on the loan, which could be as low as 3.5% with todays rates. Or you could keep the 3.5% loan and invest the $300k into something that returns much more on average, offsetting the small cost of the mortgage interest and leading to more wealth overall over time.

Problem is people aren’t buying it because of its use as a currency, they are buying it because they expect it to go up in value. We have all the traits of a speculative bubble. Doesn’t matter if it’s tulips, housing, or a new technology. Of course there is a good chance I am wrong. Nobody can ever really tell when a bubble happens or if it will burst.

The important distinction is that when you save cash, you plan to then use that cash to buy something later. It’s cash from start to finish. People are using Bitcoin as a vehicle to save money because they believe it will go up in value. To cash out they exchange it for cash and then buy stuff. Bitcoin is only involved for speculation that it will rise in value faster than other assets.
