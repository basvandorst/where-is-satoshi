i already have them sitting in electrum but getting a bit paranoid about using their web wallet, am i being too paranoid here or are my worries justified that it could go down or something like that?

BFX got hacked last year and lost around 70 million in funds, they have paid out everyone fully (that decided to keep their BFX tokens, you were allowed to sell them for a loss and they gained value over time)
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:55:58
same here!

the issue is i play in the US and the feds don't like poker transactions going through banks, it's not "illegal" to play online but it's grey area, what is illegal is for banks to take poker related transactions so i'm assuming coinbase just decided to nope the fuck on that one so they won't have to deal with anyone coming for them for not following the guidelines
been many cases of them shutting down accounts because they said they were from gambling related transactions which i find hard to believe they can really proof those things, maybe they would just get one guy who fessed up and contacted everyone within that blockchain 
thank you :)

My real problem is when the first major crashed happened, it was due to mtgox going down for a few hours..  
We just aren't certain of outside forces outside of LOLCHINA, anything can happen that can devastate a ton of people
Guess people like that gamble though.. No shit, it all makes sense now
asians = gamblers
bitcoin = gamblers
asians = bitcoins

@ his statement about bitcoins buying drugs, he's obviously aware the only reason he is in business is because of Silk Road and a demand for bitcoins.  So funny
