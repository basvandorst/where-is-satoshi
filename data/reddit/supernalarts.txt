Honestly the "it could go to zero" is a dumb arguement. Like, yeah, anything can go to zero.

lol this is such a silly meme. it takes maybe a few months to understand how to read the market and know when to buy. the "now it's dropping so i wont buy" is when you buy, especially when it bottoms out. its best to look in the history and ask, " have we been at this mark before?" if the answer is yes, and more than once or twice, then it's safe to buy.

Let's remember there's more than just bitcoin, and we're over all still quite early in the space. Once this all matures, just wait and see how the mandela will unfold. Libra, central bank/government stablecoins will force lots of people to actually get used to using blockchain tech, and then it will get folks to listen in on the wider use and other apps, spreading mostly amongst younger folks with more time and interest beyond money, and eventually people will settle on whatever is the current decentralized ecosystem. Ethereum is ahead of the pack right now and will likely dominate, but we've got 5 years i think before adopton goes crazy and the global shift becomes noticeable.

gotta look out farther on the charts; while those folks are selling short, other are accumulating, waiting for the halvening to then convert their stack to a stablecoin and profit big time.

got a friend here if ya need one. Stoicism has really helped me get through 2018; could have sold 12 eth when it was 1k but HODL'd and forgot the way this game works.  march was a sad feeling, especially when it rose back up to 800. atleast i pulled some out, but man..
even so, made like 5k so far from december :)
