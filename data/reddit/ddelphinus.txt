On a similar point, I've taken out 25%.
If you went from 1000 to 2000, take out 500.
Still leaves you with more investment, but it needs to drop 66% at minimum to make you lose money.

You either need the wallet.dat file + password or your seed right?
So if you do have the password, your best chance would be to analyze your old computers with forensic tools and try to find your wallet file..
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:22:33
That website offers to send your wallet ID to your email. So if he has the password, I don't see any reason why he can't access his coins?

In short; the article itself is quite positive. It illustrates that crypto is no longer just for "techies", but if you look beyond that it's a groundbreaking technology that is starting to become the norm next to stock. 
The portret of "bitcoin owners" (4) is a bit unfortunate in my opinion, but not negative either. It does show that some people see it as "just speculation to make money". Which I guess is true for part of the community. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:33:48
It doesn't say "recommend" literally but the editorial note is very clearly positive about the technology and adoption by "respectable people". 
It's the interviewed people that don't seem to have a clue, I find the editors words very convincing.

Don't get me wrong, I want to make money as well. 
However, what does frustrate me is the people that don't even know what "blockchain" is or why Bitcoin actually has value. At least read up on the thing that will buy you your lambo eventually...

Probably just people taking their profit. 
If you expect BCC to fail, it's wiser to take profit now than to gamble that BCC will be worth more as the inevitable dip that will follow shortly after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:13:19
So this is what concerns me; the whole basis of Bitcoin security is that you can mathematically never create an address that already exists (due to the immense number of possibilities). Otherwise you would have full access to the account.
Therefore we should also believe that a typo can never result into a payment to an existing address. The odds of that happening are the same as someone creating a new address that already exists?
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:43:10
Curious when you expect the price to crash?

I honestly wouldn't follow the top advice of lying to your wife. It will come out eventually and she might not take it well.
Secondly, having a good relationship is more important than any kind of money. Don't let your virtual money already drive a wedge and start thinking about divorce etc. You're happy together, you have a kid together. If it doesn't work out, you'll have a lot more to regret than 900k..
My advice: Plan a nice dinner and tell her how amazing you did. Sell out 30-40% to buy a house for yourself, so you can live rent free and take some profit. Tell her you're holding the rest. You made 1.8m, she'll trust you on this I hope.

Great idea, but that's a lot of money we need to gather!

You don't need to connect it to send money to it, just write down the receiving address.But I always connect it before transferring money to double check everything. 
For selling, you'll need to connect it. For trading it's not really convenient.

If explaining Bitcoin didn't work, switch to coins that are simpler to understand the value of. Either because they are like shares (Lykke) or have a clear business case behind it (Golem, SIA). Just examples of course, pick whatever you like.
That could instill faith in Blockchain technology and open him up for more abstract value chains like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:04:21
For Bitcoin that won't be worthwhile due to transaction cost.
You can investigate other coins supported on the Ledger that have lower transaction costs. Coins such as Ripple have minimal fees per transaction but do your own research on which coins you want.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:14:56
Well done!

You can indeed arbitrage between these markets. However with the buy/sell costs, transfer costs, time to send between exchanges it needs to be larger to make any profit..
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:48:30
I used to sell to the highest buy order (and vice versa), not paying attention to the big spreads for some coins and losing 10-20% with each transaction.

You're unlikely to discover the owner of the Bitcoin address, although I would keep monitoring it just in case.
You're best shot is forensic analysis of your machine, try to discover the type of malware, the IP address where it was sending data etc.
Bit of luck it's an inexperienced hacker that left some traces..

If you made $300k in total, I wouldn't spend it all on a Tesla..with the insurance costs, depreciation of the car, etc.

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:40:26
Only if you really plan to buy more..otherwise a $100 investment to protect $200 isnt worth it..
Closer to the fork date, it will become clear which exchanges will support the fork.

Interesting read, thanks for writing this up. Definately helped me form an opinion on the topic!
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:18:04
There is never a loss for them. 
If you use 10x leverage and the coins goes the wrong way for 10%, they'll cancel your trade and your money is gone.
So you'll lose everything, but they'll get their full leverage back. 
Ie, if you invest 1 BTC, you can gamble with 10 BTC. But if they drop to what was originally 9 BTC, they'll take yours and get their own 9 BTC back out. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:05:05
Hardware storage such as Ledger and Trezor can have a "pressure" code which only shows a minimal part of your holdings and hides the rest

I've been wondering this for a while; is it possible the same address is generated twice? Or are new addresses checked against the blockchain? 
I understand the chance of generating a random address which already exists is a lot smaller than winning the jackpot, but could it occasionally start to happen in the future?

If you want to compare cryptocurrency to stocks, you should see it as start up companies. 
High risk, potential high reward. Some of the start ups have good ideas, others are crap. Similar to stocks and start ups, do your research on the coin you want to invest in and don't be scared of the incredible fluctuation in price if you believe in the idea behind it.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:53:44
It would break one of the key rules: "never invest more than you're willing to lose".
Diversifying into Bitcoin; that would be a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:13:36
It's a choice only you could make I guess. Depends on how old you are, whether you're happy with your job, etc. 
I can only share my reasoning. 
My strategy has been so far to cash out ~20% after each big increase. When I had $5k, I sold $1k. When the $4k became $10k, I sold $2k and kept the rest. 
My plan is to cash out $5k at 25k and if I ever reach $50k, I'll cash out $10k. For me that's a balance that works. It allows me to continue profiting from the price increases but I know I've secured some money when everything comes crashing down at some point. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:00:38
The minimum, the transfer fee is around 1% of that. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:44:12
It's not steady, it's increasing. All other coins are dropping, people are moving to BTC for their free cash.

Think about what you would do with the money if you sold right now...I don't have an immediate need so would just put it on my bank account against 0.1% interest. 
That's why (even though crypto is now 80% of my savings) I'm not selling. I'm only selling if there is actually something useful I can do with the money. Otherwise, it's more profitable to just hodl.

You're definitely overthinking this. All of us would want to be in your position :) 
Just tell your family and if it's true (and you really have millions) than get a lawyer. Small price to pay on such as large amount to get cash. 
Pay a lawyer, pay some taxes and enjoy it. Just indeed don't tell anyone outside your direct family or buy a lambo...
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:05:59
This is exactly what I'm struggling with. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, but some alt coins have been able to take the concept and further improve it (like Monero with privacy). 
The question whether people will switch to these "improved alt coins" or stay with Bitcoin could cost or earn me a lot of money as the intrinsic value of the coins is minimal and it's all about supply and demand. 
At the moment, I believe that the first mover advantage of Bitcoin will ensure they'll stay on top. Bitcoin has been added to pension funds, can be used to purchase tangible stuff, etc. 
Video 2000 was technically superior to VHS, but never made it. VHS became the standard. I think that will be the same for Bitcoin. 
There are technically superior alt coins, but Bitcoin will become the standard. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:41:09
It's a lot, but not "life changing" indeed. If you quite your job now and travel for 4-5 years, it could be difficult to find a new job when you return and money is running out. 
Personally, I would cash out 1-2 year's worth and keep my job. Use it as a nice extra (luxury holiday, buy some stuff you've always wanted, some extra savings). Spoil yourself with the profits you've gotten and enjoy it. 
The rest I would just hodl and wait to see if it becomes truly a lot (ie. 30-40 years of salary), while continuing to work. If it ever crashes, you still had a great time with a part of the profit.
