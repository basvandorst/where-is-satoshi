Obviously.

Do you use default settings or do you adjust for 24/7 market? I've been using crypto adjusted settings (20, 60, 120, 30) but I see that on the 1 day with default settings a bearish tk cross is observed but is not in modified crypto settings.

Ah, a fellow cloud trader. Nice.

@_date: 2017-12-13 13:40:54
Yep. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:02
It wasn't not considered like kind either. Things that are not considered like kind are explicitly stated in the tax code
@_date: 2014-11-21 03:33:07
It's a centralized application on top of a technology that is meant to be decentralized.

newegg dumping its btc...
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:04:58
Thanks man!

Changetip is contradictory to everything bitcoin represents. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 11:37:09
I don't know if this is even achievable with out significantly altering bitcoins protocol.  But, there is no reason why bitcoin can't coexist with another cryptocurrency that is designed specifically for decentralized tipping. 
[Reddcoin seems to be doing some pretty cool things in regards to microtransactions.](   
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:31:46
Every time I see someone use changetip  I can just picture him tipping his fedora simultaneously.  
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:00:38
It's a centralized app that defeats the purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:03:18
@_date: 2014-11-20 08:41:58
Would rather just spend $30 on btc.
@_date: 2014-12-27 09:02:23
How is that relevant?  But yes, the comericals were much "shittier than reddcoin" whatever that means to you.  I don't really see how they are comparable.  The commercials were bad - they felt like very little thought went into them.  Bitcoin is awesome and I love it, but it will never be as good as reddcoin for tipping and microtransactions. But again, don't see relevance. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 11:33:59
I believe [this]( is close to completion.  I know most bitcoin people don't care much for altcoins, and I really don't either, but reddcoin seems to serve a very specific purpose and will soon serve that purpose very well.  Much better than bitcoin ever could.
EDIT: The [browser wallet]( is actually now in beta testing
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:52:25
...and it was pretty bad.  
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:53:46
You are delusional if you think they were well done.  The two I've seen were incredibly lame and generic.
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:53:23
I agree, it was shit.
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:45:19
perhaps we should talk like them too.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:17:14
Wouldnt a decentralized wallet to wallet method for micropayments be better and more in line with  bitcoins purpose?
@_date: 2014-12-27 09:21:34
I don't see how bitcoin could ever have a fully decentralized wallet to wallet tipping system or a blockchain level ID system that will allow people to associate a username with a private key. I love bitcoin, but it's just not that good for tipping and microtransactions.  
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:42:23
That's not an insult.
@_date: 2014-11-20 08:48:13
I've been waiting for over a month now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:52:05
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:22:58
But seriously, I think the price will hover somewhere between $250-400 until 2015.  And I'm totally okay with that as it gives me time to obtain some more coins.
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:41:24
 You can be a fan of bitcoin and altcoins. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:33:18
Isn't one of the major "selling points" for bitcoin that transaction fees are practically zero?
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:47:27
Decentralized wallet to wallet tipping would be superior.
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:03:41
Did you make an account just so you could share this useless comment?
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:40:10
I think it's kind of ironic how the people that use changetip go on an on about bitcoin ushering in a new age of decentralization all the while using a centralized application to "prove" their point. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:42:03
A fully decentralized version already exists.  Just not for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:24:56
Maybe sidechains will be able to figure out a way to do seamless decentralized tipping. I think this is a case where an altcoin will be able to do this much better than bitcoin ever could though.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:23:36
Decentralized wallet to wallet tipping can't get here soon enough.
@_date: 2014-11-20 08:39:16
It went down.  Later it will go up, and then later it will go down again. Jesus.
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:50:40
It's unnecessary.  Decentralized wallet to wallet tipping is what's up.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:04:20
Why are you so against Satoshi's vision of larger blocks?
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:08:56
Also, larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:05:39
At gun point.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:06:17
Hey, look who it is.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:05:07
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:02:51
Yeah I was just pointing out that lately it hasn't been following btc as closely as most other coins or as it has in the past. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:26:04
So you're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:54:12
Is this article about camwhores?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:33:15
How do the taxes work on that? Property for property trade right? No taxes?

The economy is recovering pretty quickly under Trump.

Did you even watch the video or are you just going thru my post history?

Damn this guy is very well spoken and in tune with reality.
