Problem is no one is telling these beginners that web wallets are not secure storage and can be hack with simple malware and that they need to spend a small amount of time practicing proper asset security. We need to be pushing cold/offline storage education. 95% of people I see on here or more don't use cold storage.

No problem glad to help. Practice setting up an online watching only wallet, signing transactions, and restoring your wallet from seed and you should feel very comfortable after that.

Damn, you weren't joking about the shortage...might invest in some cocoa bean farms.

Blatant lies to the community in the name of protecting their brand. I pity the noob who reads this and assumes it's okay to store his bitcoin on BCI.

You seem to think money doesn't affect emotions and motives of the vast majority of people. Might want to learn that one quickly.

Don't store coins on an online wallet. Only transfer small amounts you are going to use to them.

You're a complete idiot.

1.) bitaddress is good. 
2.) Yes, enough people use and is verified constantly. If you want anything more look into using dice.
3.) I recommend an offline Armory or Electrum wallet
4.) Don't give your brother, parents full keys. Use BIP38 and store the passwords separately. Also Armory offers m-of-n deterministic seeds where you need 2 of 3 or 2 of 4 etc copies to access your funds. 
Congrats on taking your asset protection seriously.

As I figured...you dumbasses have nothing. My statement stands as truth.

Yep. It's completely cringeworthy and misleading to someone uninformed. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:54:46
With BIP38 you can store your wallets securely as you would non encrypted, but if you want you could add a memorable password vs something hard to remember. This way, even if you lose it, you will have it in your memory. Still much safer than unencrypted wallets. You wouldn't want your parents or brother to get robbed and then all your funds are gone because of that. I highly suggested going forward with an offline Armory set up with watching wallet and continue to create and practice using different types of paper wallets until you are comfortable and know exactly what you want to do.

Sounds like you are only semi-informed about pot smoking. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:01:24
Explain your downvotes idiots. If you consciously decide to use a less secure method while aware of the risks, you are essentially asking for it to happen.

A noob who refuses to take their bitcoin education to the next level therefore bringing down the collective knowledge of this section. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:12:29


They are different in that they serve the purpose of buying and selling. It's still stupid to keep your coins there. CB vault is alright for a noob with a small amount of funds, but I don't get why we aren't pushing everyone to learn cold/offline storage as the standard. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:10:16


Completely ignorant statement. Are there some people like this? Of course. Are most? Hell no. They wouldn't be around if it wasn't for the profit. Do you really think it's okay right now for blockchain.info to be posting on this sub and spreading ideas to noobs that their wallet is completely safe to use with passwords and 2fa when in reality some simple malware will have users balance emptied and never to be seen again. Do you think they would be here doing this if they didn't have advertising posted on their site? Yes, good people exist, but don't be ignorant when it comes to profitable business. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:47:29
You're naive as fuck. Must be cool living in an alternate reality where people trade millions of dollars for morals and values instead of the other way around. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:17:06


It's just a wallet created by a random Reddit user. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:10:31
If you use Blockchain.info (or another web based wallet) to store your coins at this point you deserve to have them lost/stolen.
