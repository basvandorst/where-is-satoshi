We’re not toxic now but as you can see she was mega controlling and negative about any ideas. Now we’re at peace and just give each other shit in a friendly way. We’ve grown up and moved on. 
That friend sold to someone else, I think a guy that owns a “buy/sell gold” shop. Not sure beyond that.

Lol@ sending my bitcoin to anyone. I’m like “can I pay you in these worthless fiat notes from the banking cartel? I prefer to hold on to real money.”?

I could I see that. Good points.

If you’re a time travel why not go back and buy at $10 or less?
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:37:35
I agree. I think maybe a bit or even a satoshi will be on par with a dollars spending power, for what little it buys today.

That’s my motto next time someone’s like “yo &lt;fortnite/realdoll/playtex/whatever dumbass company&gt; is making a crypto”

I heard Biden is about hodling. Girls by the butt that is. ;)
Seriously career politicians are all slaves to lobbyists, special interests groups but most of all the fed. 
Greed is good, it drives capitalism. Difference is the fiat game is zero sum game. Bitcoin is win for all except the classic macroeconomics shell game most are trapped in. Decentralization shakes the establishment.

Dude why be a fucking life hating prick? Always got to be some I know better than everyone else down voting acorn dick with something negative to say.

Even bitcoin needed a split ;)
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:48:28
That’s cool perspective being you’re a programmer. I’m a data center network architecture guy but I’ve been working on python, ruby, chef etc so hoping I can bridge into that realm... and bank btc as long as I get checks ;)

Good point but I feel how could you know. It was scaling so fast. I had several coins at the time but dreaded I didn’t buy more. So when it crashed I was glad because even though I didn’t capture the top price and rebuy I did get a chance to buy a bunch at what I felt was a discount. For me bitcoin is a retirement plan alongside my 401k, ira, silver/gold bullion, etc. I’m excited to see where it goes, not just for me but for freedom for all of us from a single entity. I read the time traveler logs and while I don’t believe it I do feel it could be the future not of commerce but of ownership like early stocks. Imagine getting in Berkshire Hathaway stock at initial price. I think that’s what we’re looking at.

Funny that’s what your mom said about my load.

When you look at the calculations that it will be able to do its staggering. Plus coming of string AI...
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:43:34
I find it funny how assholes like you are so toxic that you can’t even support something that would benefit you. 
I think it speaks to how antisocial that this group has downvoted my post to zero but your dipshit illogical self destructive attitude gets upvotes. Sick
Hope you lose your keys and lose out so you don’t “get your chance”. ..|..

Nah. I bought it at 700, didn’t sell at 20k

Posers gonna pose. But if you Slap “bitcoin” on a value menu burger you’ll get $5 easy
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:23:19
Nah let it drop. I want to buy buy buy

See I think labor, even AI labor, will never be free. Someone always wants to get paid. Plus maintenance, power, etc. I see it like washing machines or dish washers. They didn’t get rid of labor, they just deferred the intensity of that labor via money and space. I see AI being like that. Pay a month subscription for whatever level of service plus utility and upkeep be it software or hardware, even robotics. It’s just a new form of slavery, both of the AI and the user, to a new form of master.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:17:39
Yes. But not 800 ;)
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:20:11
Really? 
Where did I say I knew better? I’m talking about my personal decision to buy and hopefully no for a little better dip. 
Where was I being hateful? Because I didn’t post a stupid simpsons picture or fanboy your latest theory you’re going to be an asshole. 
Fuck you and your toxic ass group. Enjoy stacking  your coin in your moms basement with your whale girlfriend. Peace out.
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:43:44
Yeah I agree. Or people that buy $50 worth then complain of a 4% drop. Bitcoin is not a fad.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:49:52
0. 
The number of coins you have and fucks I give. Blocked mr positivity xoxo
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:25:23
Negative much? Not everyone uses bitcoin to buy their groceries or day trades. There’s room for all in bitcoin. 
Btw I bought in at $700 in mid 2016 and held so I’m well in the black thank you very much.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:01:59
There’s no bottom. Just good times to buy
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:55:12
When you say “I think it will reach 10 mil” I think this is such a shift of wealth that those who hold the power now in fiat and influence like businesses and lobbyist will have so much to lose I think we’ll see some try to demonized and outlaw bitcoin way more than today like its kiddie porn, ie as its the means to evil and unwholesome ends that hurt the innocent. This is the only way they can mind fuck the unwashed masses to stay under their fiat crutch. I almost feel there will be an underground movement where bitcoin is bartered for because owning it is a state crime punishable by death.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:36:29
Well said. I think in 2011 it was more of a penny stock no real skin in the game. By 2016 I seen enough to know this was going to be a real future. I’ve been evangelizing bitcoin to everybody that would listen including friends that don’t have much to invest but that I still feel there is value in getting some, even if a small amount. Time will tell but I feel bitcoin is the future. I think other cryptocurrency’s will have their place but bitcoin will be the chief trusted medium for all exchanges in the future.

Yup that’s math. Congrats on 2nd grade.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:42:34
I’m sure you bought it all back at the lowest price too. Stupid me for buying in the 700s and holding
@_date: 2019-07-28 05:26:23
I have an auto buy weekly for small amount but I’m wanting to buy a few coins in a low. :)
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:18:38
I totally agree. Like gold they will see if as “why aren’t you all in on the dollar comrade?”  We will be seen as “currency manipulators”, “alternate currency criminals”, and “destabilizers to the global economy”. We will be boogeyman that made their house of cards fall apart. But what worries me in joblessness due to AI. Not even talking super strong AI singularity level, just strong AI replacing jobs and mass world poverty. Massively monopolies stronger than governments that rule over the good and services like company stores in ol mining towns. What will be bitcoins worth of goods and services are centralized and commerce is centralized? That’s what worries me. Not the revolution but the revolution after the revolution.

I’m worried so you downvote? I’m just saying these Ted talks by experts have me concerned.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:46:16
You’re right. Buy high and sell low. Good job. Congrats

I’m just trying to get background information on why it’s dropped like 30% last few days. All the news outlets are saying that it’s got a crash of worthlessness. I guess I’m just looking for some encouragement that there’s a reason behind this and that everything’s OK
