Really sucked though. I was trying to get some dogecoins for christmas stocking stuffers and the exchange took so long that when it finally processed I ended up getting only 4/5 of the coins I was expecting. I was going to give out paper wallets with a nice round number of coins but now I'm going to have to change the amount a little.

Thanks, do you take dogecoin tips?
EDIT: Also, do I not need to worry about eviction with the fee set at 140? I'm not sure what that is but I'm assuming that means the transaction wont be processed.

I used 140 satoshis for my transaction fee today and I keep seeing 140 getting clumped in a group with a range of 100-140. Is this grouping just arbitrary to help visualize the data or am I clumped together with everyone in that group and would have been in a significantly greater position if I had only set the fee to 141?

Yeah, it has probably been 24 hours now and it's still unconfirmed.
EDIT: Finally got confirmed!

I used 140 satoshis this morning for my transaction fee this morning. I'm trying to figure out how long it's going to take. Do you know how long it would take or how I would figure out how long it will take?

Um, I remember this guy conspired to kill a guy.

He directly asked an undercover agent to murder someone for $80,000. I don't care if they didn't press those charges.
