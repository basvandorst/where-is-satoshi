Huh I got a like $3k if bitcoins in quadrigacx. Maybe I should do that lol.

If the price falls even temporarily below what they bought it for they would be angry at you and hold a grudge. That is my prediction.

I accidently bought $2k of bitcoins at the ath by miss clicking ;(

I think I found my hard drive with like 14 bitcoins I got when it first came out by doing a survey. Now I need a cable that can transfer info from old school HDD to sata.

In Canada quadrigacx is pretty good with that. For large funds takes 5 days for money to come in but then u can instantly buy and sell btc or other crypto.

Oh yea don't worry I know that. I've been in the btc game for years.

This is why you wake up at 3am and check prices. Usually they go down at that time.

Canadian here, I use Quadrigacx.

Go to a printshop. Get some heavy grade paper. And then get it laminated. Should be even okay underwater.

Why would you lose all your money if the value drops to 4950? You would have $4950 worth of bitcoin so technically you would have lost $50.

Oh the media. Hacker lol. Just like the hack fb when someone doesn't log out meme.
