The same Jeffrey Epstein that Trump was hangin’ out with in 94?
I will concede it’s not rape when you’ve paid a prostitute to pee on you.

Off the top of my head: privatizing the EPA would have way too much potential for large corporations with vested interests (ie oil / fracking) to pump money into the company controlling policies.

Sorta... I just don’t see how a generalization about a currency that isn’t specific to the United States can be made. 
How is having the smallest confirmed cabinet supporting bitcoin?

It’s hard to say, ya know? I wouldn’t doubt it, given the campaign contributions received by Scott Pruitt from fossil fuel industries...but I can neither prove nor disprove anything. 
That’s a great question and I don’t have a definitive answer. I think the best option lies somewhere in the grey area. Even if there was mass adoption of block chain technology, what would prevent a member of the board (whether centralized or not) from creating a new address that could be used for clandestine funds?

His wife accused him of raping her in 1989. 
Y’all gotta get your facts straight.

I see you edited that first post. 
I’m all for decentralized money, don’t get me wrong. I think it’s intellectually dishonest to say that if one decentralized thing is good for society then all decentralization is good.

Walmart is a shitty company, yes - but their customers have nothing to do with it. 
They treat their employees poorly. Not giving them enough hours or high enough wages. They encourage employees to take advantage of government assistance, despite taking in massive profits. 
They move in to communities that have locally owned shops, undercut said shops, and put hardworking entrepreneurs out of business. Once they’ve cornered the market they jack their prices up. 
You want a piece of white trash, look no further than Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress.
