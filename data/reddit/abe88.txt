I see half bitcoin logo, and half website.

You use blockchain.info for a daily wallet and keep a majority on gox. If you don't feel comfortable leaving them on gox, set up a [paper wallet]( and keep them offline.

Bitcoin is a protocol designed around a ledger that lists all bitcoin addresses and balances. A bitcoin address is a pair of numbers, one is listed in the ledger, the other number is kept private and used to send money from the address.
 Computers hosting the ledger listen for balance transfers and compete to write the transfers to the ledger. The competition takes shape in a lottery where processing power buys tickets.
 About every ten minutes a computer wins the lottery then the transfers they've collected go into a file and are written to the ledger. Additionally, fifty new bitcoin are created and credited to the winner's address. 
The file the winner created containing the transfers is shared throughout the network so hosts can put the transfers in their ledger and begin a new lottery for upcoming transfers.

How do you tell which transactions were created by the network, and which ones were created by the miner so the block would be accepted?

Your average user isn't going to check the blockchain when receiving payments. Stolen coins quickly get diluted and distributed throughout the money supply. Coins from last year's 25k hack are probably in your wallet right now.
Honest people will receive stolen coins, and if an exchange doesn't let them sell the coins there the user will spend them elsewhere. It isn't a problem.

Services like this have their uses.
You can simply send someone the URL to a wallet, with the blockchain.info wallet you would also have to send them the login information. Not really a big difference, but I would use this over BC.info if I were sending someone bitcoin and they didn't have a wallet set up.

Now we just need to get some coin together and hire some girls from to get the thing started.

These private companies have to pay rent, developers, power, hosting, and they must also offer fraud protection for their customers - all this and a profit. These services are reflected in the transaction fees which will be considerably higher than bitcoin. Bitcoin is just too cheap to compete with, especially when you have to offer fraud protection.

  Bitcoin is a protocol designed around a ledger that lists all bitcoin addresses and balances. A bitcoin address is a pair of numbers, one is listed in the ledger, the other number is kept private and used to send money from the address.
  Computers hosting the ledger listen for balance transfers and compete to write the transfers to the ledger. The competition takes shape in a lottery where processing power buys tickets.
  About every ten minutes a computer wins the lottery then the transfers they've collected go into a file and are written to the ledger. Additionally, fifty new bitcoin are created and credited to the winner's address.
  The file the winner created containing the transfers is shared throughout the network so hosts can put the transfers in their ledger and begin a new lottery for upcoming transfers.
Mining is just another way to purchase bitcoin - if it is cheaper to mine, then do that. If not, buy on the exchange.


This is a tough question to answer. There are a lot of ways. Any large company announcing they'd accept it would probably get it going. A small town using the currency exclusively might also work. 
I honestly think it's on the way. Bitcoin is mentioned more positively in paypal threads and people I know are hearing about it from others.

Just let it sit there connected to peers.
It doesn't broadcast the transaction right away, I think it waits for other new transactions then forwards the new one on with those or something similar.
@_date: 2012-03-13 03:15:04
Do you know if -rescan verifies the blockchain or does it just search for the addresses in the wallet?

I believe they own over 10k coins, purchased when they were being threatened with having bank accounts closed.

You'll just go and spend those coins somewhere that doesn't check - then they'll do the same, and eventually it is diluted down to nothing. The exchanges that check for tainted coins are going to lose customers - no honest customer is going to take a loss when they did nothing wrong, they'll simply sell the coins on a different exchange that doesn't bother to check - there are plenty of them that don't.
If the thief wanted to, they could start sending random amounts of stolen coins to public bitcoin addresses listed in the forum, then the exchange wouldn't be able to deny coins because a bunch of customer account would be "tainted."

I posted this in a previous thread. It is the most concise way I could think to describe it. 
I considered explaining how double-spends are prevented, but couldn't get it shorter than a few paragraphs.
Criticisms are welcome.

You might be able to make a bitinstant deposit with a debit card, but I don't know.

Its 2012 - there are $80 android phones being released in Africa and the cost of solar panels has been falling. Bitcoin would be a great way to get the economy to invest in IT infrastructure, because it reduces the cost of using the currency. 
If a couple of these governments step-up and introduce bitcoin in the form of tamper-evident printed private-keys, they would have at least the same utility of the current government notes. Individuals using the notes would be able to trade the keys, or load them into a phone or computer if they need to send them long distance. People eventually start getting phones and setting up connectivity because it is *easier* than using paper notes.

This is sort of what I was hoping for but it looks like the person who started it is going for a general "bitcoin porn here." I have no interest in moderating that subreddit, but I do think that it could be popular.

I'd post [here]( and explain your situation and see if they respond. Hopefully it wasn't too much cash, but if you really do feel like you're getting screwed, let the community know so nobody else does.

Bitcoin was down to $1.96 a few months ago. If the owner had loaded up during this time, then perhaps it is possible for him to cover.
That said, I don't think I'd keep more than $20 in the site until they incorporate.

You will have a difficult time finding people to sell you bitcoins with a credit card because so many people buy bitcoins with stolen cards and the payments get reversed.
You can buy physical bitcoins from memorydealers.com with a credit card, but it is quite a bit higher than exchange price.
