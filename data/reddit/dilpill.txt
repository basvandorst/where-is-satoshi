Again, I don't agree with this "philosophy", but it is consistent. People are destroying *their own property* because they don't agree with the manufacturers.

The idea is that it removes a device that doesn't support bitcoin from the market. Donating the phones wouldn't reduce the number of people with iPhones (devices that don't support bitcoin).

Just curious, do you mean to compare the Federal Reserve system to a Soviet-type economic system, or are you using a literal interpretation of central planning where any kind of economic decision made by a central authority qualifies?

Price fixing isn't normally defined as changing the supply of the item in question. But just out of curiosity, what is the significance? Money is neutral in the long run.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:05:46
I'm not saying I personally agree, but it is not logically flawed. Fewer iPhones means fewer people with bitcoin blocking phones.

Holy shit, not one of the top 10 comments addresses any of the content of the post. All of them are ad-hominem attacks or outraged reactions to the (yes, purposefully sensationalist and exaggerated) title.
Does anyone have a response to his point, which is that there isn't much reason to think Bitcoin will ever be a stable store of value (that you can relatively precisely estimate how much a certain amount of Bitcoin will buy in several years' time).
This isn't a quack argument. It's backed by the fact that 99% of all Bitcoin transactions are done where prices are set in terms of a fiat currency. There aren't many places where you can buy a given item for x Bitcoin and be confident at all that you will be able to buy it in several weeks' time for x +/- 15%.

Wages are very resistant to deflation because of nominal downward rigidity. Employers do not like to cut wages, presumably because of the effect it has on employee morale. This makes it more difficult for the labor market to clear, leading to unnecessarily higher unemployment.
This is a plot of nominal wage changes from one of the last few years. The most noticeable part of the plot is the spike at a wage change of 0%. Above 0%, the distribution is approximately normal. However, below 0%, the recorded values fall short of what would be expected, given a normal distribution. The total shortfall is approximately equal to the excess at 0%.

I'm using 'currency' as a synonym for money. I know that most Bitcoin is not in the form of coins and bills. The same arguments apply.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:11:22
Again, I'm asking for a specific, logical response to the argument that Bitcoin is unlikely to be a stable store of value. Some broad "it's beyond your understanding, clearly" doesn't cut shit.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:47:15
So remind me then.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:42:11
Assuming the existence of alternative stores of value that earn interest, a store of value is the least important of the three for currency.

That in no way prove that Keynesianism is self destructing. Where's the hyperinflation? Where's the collapse of the dollar? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:56:56
No, I'm saying that is the demand for transactions, increasing the fees people are willing to pay. Supply of transaction processing is very high now, resulting in the low fees you describe. For what purpose would one buy a significant amount of bitcoin other than to use as money?
Those side benefits from the cryptographic characteristics of the blockchain can be used with a transaction of extremely low value. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:23:04
Clearly no. Very few people use bitcoin as a day-to-day currency. Most use is speculative or held for short periods to use in transactions where buyers convert their fiat into Bitcoin, spend it relatively quickly, and then sellers quickly convert them back into fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:03:50
No, that is extremely relevant to the topic. Being a stable store of value is required if people are expected to use Bitcoin as their primary currency (which is what I thought our entire discussion was about).
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:48:52
I mean fundamental in the sense that it is what it is. Gold is gold. Bitcoin is a large set of random hash-codes.
By guaranteed exchange, I mean in a manner similar to how the gold standard used to work. There is nowhere you can go with Bitcoin and unconditionally exchange it for a set quantity of a physical asset.
This isn't meant to say that Bitcoin is worthless. It's not. People are willing to pay $600 for one. But there is no fundamental value to random-looking data. If the idea of Bitcoin fell out of favor with people, nothing stops it from having a value of nothing, similarly to fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:43:18
Prices in dollars have been incredibly stable, in that expectations of overall prices from 10 years ago are not far off from what they are today. Bitcoin can never achieve this level of stability because its supply cannot be reduced or increased in response to changes in demand for them. We take price stability for granted, but historically, when the supply of money was relatively fixed, prices fluctuated wildly over the business cycle.
The reason Krugman says Bitcoin may be "evil" is not because it is unknown, but because of what it [can] facilitate[s]. The ease with which Bitcoin can be used to evade the law is cause for concern, as all but the most ardent Anarcho-Capitalists would have to concede, even if only in an abstract, not-as-things-are-now sense.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:47:28
How I'm defining "stability" is predictability in prices. I have a decent idea what $1000 will buy me 5 years from now. Whereas in Bitcoin I have absolutely no idea at all.
I do not see a difference between Dollar vs Bitcoin and Bitcoin vs Dollar. Yes, the dollar has been going down in value relative to Bitcoin. However, the value of most goods has been far more stable vis a vis the dollar, rather than Bitcoin, and that is not a changing trend. That is my point. No one has given a convincing argument that this will change, other than vague "Bitcoin is revolutionary" can-not-be-wrong nothings.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:41:03
Those are values of accessing the blockchain, i.e. transaction fees. The value of an actual unit of bitcoin is still fully derived from its convertibility.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:38:07
Ok, I want 99% deflation. Why isn't this possible/desirable?
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:29:44
I doubt that its volatility has been decreasing, and you have not provided evidence that it has. The article mentioned a single point in the past where volatility was higher. Two points does not a trend make.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:20:41
Persistent and predictable devaluation, yes. That's what really matters, is that you know what your money will be worth in the future. If you don't want savings to erode, then it is a good thing that people are encouraged to "put it to work" by investing in anything. For most people though, knowing that their money will be almost certainly be able to buy 90% of what it can today in 5 years is worth the ~2% annual loss in purchasing power. If they'd rather have less certainty but more likely growth in purchasing power, they are free to invest.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:29:02
Alright, that's better, but we're looking at a very shallow trend when the benchmark here is a maximum of +/- 3% in value at any point during a year. A heck of a lot of extrapolation would be required to get to that point, certainly more than is reasonable given the data available.
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:07:04
Careful, if people expect exponential growth, there's nothing to restrain the market price from exceeding its long-run "fair" value. Bitcoin would be very vulnerable to any kind of confidence dampening event.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:15:38
Why does a higher market cap mean less volatility is possible? Bitcoin isn't an item of wealth in itself. It's purely dependent on people's faith that it can be exchanged for other things. There isn't anything fundamental for value to hold towards, and no system to manage the speed of value changes.


This is problematic because the value of something in the present is dependent on something's expected value in the future and some variable natural rate of interest. Because this rate of interest is not stable, expectations can not ever reach an anchor, and prices will frequently fluctuate and "correct". The future is unknown, and fixing one part of the puzzle (supply of Bitcoin) does nothing to change the other part.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:04:33
I'm not asking for results. I'm asking for theoretical reasoning. Why should one think Bitcoin will successfully fulfill this crucial criteria to be considered a major currency?
Clearly many people in this subreddit have the hypothesis that Bitcoin will be a stable store of value. I'm asking for the reasoning behind that hypothesis. "Wait and see" is not supporting reasoning in the slightest.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:18:01
How would it be though? Will the demand for money suddenly become highly predictable in the future? Without that assumption, it would be impossible for Bitcoin to maintain a stable value, no matter what its size.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:49:12
I never said it hasn't been more volatile than now. What I am saying is that there has yet to be a convincing reason to believe that it will ever maintain a predictable value (not necessarily relative to fiat, but to goods in general).
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:31:45


This is an insanely powerful advantage that gold has over digital assets. 
Also, I'm not arguing about the value of digital goods. What I'm concerned with is the lack of thought as to how one should value Bitcoin. Much of what I'm seeing is along the lines of "I bought Bitcoin because I think other people will buy Bitcoin and it's price will keep going up up up." This is a classic bubble mentality. Buying because you anticipate other people buying who anticipate other people buying ad-infinitum. Without underlying fundamentals improving, this is unsustainable. The fundamentals here are usefulness in exchange and usefulness as a unit of account.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:41:47
Well, in that case we have nothing to argue about. I think Bitcoin does a good job in the roles you mentioned. However, it is not accurate to say that much of the Bitcoin community doesn't think or at least want that Bitcoin will replace the USD soon. The hilarious amount of "FIAT" "FED" "BANKERS" "GOVERNMENT TYRANNY" randomly speckled everywhere as 'bad words' is evidence of that.
@_date: 2013-03-16 14:33:39
I'm worried about deflation with bitcoin specifically. The value of bitcoin isn't stable enough for moat people to want to hold significant wealth in bitcoin, and almost all prices in the bitcoin economy are tied to a dollar, euro, or pound price. These currencies currently have predictable/stable values, whereas bitcoin has tended to see severe fluctuations.
The natural tendency towards deflation is perceived by most people as an increase in the dollar/euro/pound value of bitcoin. Since almost everyone holds their savings (and earn their incomes) in their home currencies, this makes bitcoin look attractive to hold more savings in. This increases the demand for and value of bitcoin further, exacerbating deflation. Eventually, people see how much their bitcoin holdings have appreciated and "cash out".
This starts out slowly, so all that happens is that bitcoin starts to head more towards a stable price. However, the factor that lead many people to hold more savings in bitcoin was its tendency to rise in value. More people decide to cash out, and eventually the value of bitcoin starts to dip. This could really spook some people, leading more to cash out and causing a rapid fall in the dollar/euro/pound price of bitcoin. Eventually a bottom is reached, allowing the cycle to start over again.
If this cycle occurs perpetually, it will become ingrained, and people will never consider bitcoin to be useful as anthing but a means of exchange. It would be very difficult for it to start being used as a unit of account or store of long-term value when there are alternatives that have a more stable track-record.

It makes sense to me, from the tax system's perspective. Mining is a source of income, subject to income tax. If you mine 2 BTC and your tax rate is 10%, you would owe .2 BTC worth of Euros in tax.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:52:48
Is it really being adopted though? From what I can see, there hasn't been a dramatic increase in its utility as a medium of exchange or unit of account that corresponds with what is happening with price. That leaves speculation. And since Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, this speculation is dangerous.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:33:21


I'm defining intrinsic value as a fundamental that can never go away. Bitcoin has no guaranteed exchanges. It is just like fiat currency in the respect that it is fully dependent on trust and expectations.


Where is this inflation showing up other than in Bitcoin prices?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:12:47
I'm not asking about what I should do personally. I'm concerned at people saying "going all-in", "on credit", "this time is different". There is a massive level of risk here, and I'm seeing a ton of frothy statements without much fundamental analysis.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:01:55
I have read plenty of "Krugman sucks nobel prize is fake economics is a 99% sham" shit here, but I have yet to see a real argument/discussion around the ability of Bitcoin to serve as a stable store of value. I'm requesting that *anyone* provide one.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:15:48


Why? Are we magically assuming an easy, predictable rate of economic growth? The end of the business cycle?


Unless people are utterly shocked over and over at the rate of inflation for most fiat currencies (hint, 2% +/- 1% might be worth building into expectations) I don't see how this could be a significant factor. Bitcoin is fluctuating wildly even in real terms.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:35:01


Yes, that actually happens all the time, and rightfully so. Currencies can't be blamed for relative price changes, but broad, highly correlated changes in prices (as seen in highly unstable currencies, including Bitcoin) where prices of all items changes by an average significantly different from 0% can most assuredly be blamed on supply/demand problems with a currency.


What is the mechanism here? What will suddenly stop Bitcoin from being the victim of price swings from speculation? What will make demand for Bitcoin suddenly predictable?
