Ok. What are shorts.
Edit: That's funny asf, but can someone please tell me what he's actually talking about.

Bots and algorithms are a thing? I guess why wouldn't it be? Uhmm are you allowed to do that with stocks too? Or are people only doing this with coin?

Ok, sounds sketchy and illegal.

What does this mean??

Create a treasure map on a long lost public Google doc, that leads to the abyss of the internet  and leave it hidden for some random person to find in the year 3300 when it's worth 10 million in today's currency, because Earth is going to be destroyed and paper money with have no value.
Edit: why do you ask??

Ok, someone dropped all their cash on coin and it spiked a bit. 
Does this mean that all short term spikes and drops - the highs and lows that happen in *minutes*, are from individuals, or a few individuals? 
And the overall price of Bitcoin - the highs and lows that happen over *weeks/months/years* are determined by the overall volume of coin holders??????
