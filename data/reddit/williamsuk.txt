Thanks you (and everyone) for these comments. I am new to blogging, and I appreciate the feedback. It will make future articles stronger!
1. The Bitcoin network transaction fees do matter, and perhaps I should have spent more effort on including them in my calculations. I mentioned but ultimately discounted these fees because they are not always so straight forward. For instance, if you pay the BitPesa transaction from Coinbase, you do not pay these transaction fees because Coinbase currently absorbs miner fees. There are also other exchanges that charge less for Bitcoin than Coinbase's 1% (which is the figure I used) this also works in the other direction. I thus (unscientifically)  felt that 1% was a fair average number.
Your point about people who do not have access to low-cost-exchanges is very important. If you don't have access to a low cost exchange, BitPesa will not be very economical.
2. I do academic research on migration originating in Southern Africa to various parts of the world (also including other Southern African countries). I am quite certain that micro remittances will be extremely popular if they become economical and convenient. Right now they are not (although I will have to check into World Remit, as others have mentioned).

Upon further though, I think that you are right, in that I should have included the $.06 transfer fee and $0.15 exchange fees in the calculations. They modestly change the effective exchange rates for smaller amounts. Thanks again!
The article has now been updated.

World Remit is a new-ish service that I have not yet used. I do not know if it is available in the United States, where I am based. However, it seems that it might be important to do a future comparison between World Remit and BitPesa.
If World Remit is competitive with BitPesa, it shows that mainstream remittance providers like Western Union might respond to Bitcoin services like BitPesa by simply lowering fees to compete.
We also do not know whether BitPesa is profitable at 3%, or if it is trying to build a user base with low initial fees.

This is a well-written, fascinating and nuanced article on Bitcoin in Kenya and Africa more broadly. I HIGHLY recommend a read. Michael clearly conveys the current mood about Bitcoin in various Kenyan circles and dispels many of the misconceptions often thrown around on Reddit and the forums about how a Bitcoin ecosystem might develop in Africa and what it might practically mean.

It's a poem what does it mean?

Great idea. Compromise is needed. Let both sides win.

Blocksize has to go up or another solution must be found. People have to band together or this project will fail.

Yeah, I don't know why they put that in. I have no affiliation with BitFinance other than using it. I've asked them to remove it. Perhaps because I am speaking at an event that BitFinance is sponsoring.
