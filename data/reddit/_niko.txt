How do you keep track of all these passwords?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:37:48
This may come as a surprise, but "public key" is not the same as "address".
Both are not publicly known - not even known to exist - until coins are spent by signing with their corresponding private key on the block chain.
Posting an alleged address in a public forum doesn't mean much - perhaps the keypair is not even known.

This is a reasonable question. Every layer of encryption brings it up, and also brings about the risk of loss of password(s) and funds.
Keep it simple. Every situation is unique - evaluate your own use case(s), and come up with the appropriate strategy accordingly.
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:15:22


Correct. I would add that Bitcoin still has a lot to offer to those who cannot keep their computers secure - through properly vetted third-party services. You can still do things that are not possible with legacy banking/payment services.
The risk of loss of funds is still much lower than in the case of non-expert user running their own node and storing and managing their own keys.

Except in real world you wouldn't want to limit yourself to self-powered operations, when power could be purchased and delivered more economically in the market.
The rest is pretty much already out there; nodes have been running, hardware has been evolving, etc. In the end, your goal has already been achieved - the Bitcoin network has been "maintaining itself" since the beginning. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:04:04
Nobody cares. You want some bitcoin, you go to a market and see what's offered, and/or make your offer.
Bitcoins that are lost cannot be offered, so the supply will be more scarce.
@_date: 2016-04-15 13:59:52
Actually, it's not the speculation. It's really the fact that, globally and over a period of time, the loss of coins (keys) will be reflected in the market (order books). Coins that don't exist cannot be offered. If I lose a coin, I cannot decide to sell it.

Under the hood, Bitcoin protocol only requires that the sum of inputs to a transaction is equal *or greater* than the sum of outputs. The difference, if any, is referred to as a "transaction fee" that belongs to the miner who successfully verified the transaction and secured it by including it in the block chain (public ledger).
Nowadays new coins are still being created, and distributed randomly to miners in proportion to their computing power, so fees are not really necessary for the system to function: each block brings 25 coins into existence - the "block reward" - and fees might add a few coins on top of that. In few months, the reward will halve to 12.5. The halving happens every few years, as specified by the protocol, so eventually "miners" will be relying on fees as main source of income, and some sort of fee market will emerge.
Services such as Coinbase may choose to cover (or hide from the user) the fees, or they might offer the user to choose.

I actually used bitcoin for international transfers for a while - not because I was obsessed with Bitcoin, but because it actually was the best option. Not so anymore in my case - found a cross-border banking option that works somewhat better. Here are some thoughts for you:
- Whatever you do, if anything, try with small amounts first. There are lots of moving parts involved.
- Ideally, since liquidity in Canada is low, do multiple transfers over time. This also allows you to keep funds on both ends and buy/sell simultaneously, minimizing the risk of volatility. Buy coins in Canada, sell immediately the same amount in Europe. Transfer later without rush to replenish. This will also let you do some arbitrage. Understand how orderbooks work.
- Make sure you understand tax implications of what you are doing, and plan accordingly.
- Take into account all the administrative and technical burden you'll have to deal with. Bank transfer might still be the best option.
Good luck, and let us know what happened in the end!

My knee-jerk reaction is "Good. Everybody is free to choose whom they do business with."
However, on second thought, banking services are essential nowadays, and having an account suddenly shut down can have terrible impact on one's life. 
Ideally - we, the people, have allowed banks to run a for-profit business based on a service that has become essential. In exchange, banks are to provide this service to anyone, and to be subject to regulation. 
If a massage parlor or a tattoo shop did this, it'd be totally okay with me.
Bitcoin takes this idealistic stance to the wonderful extreme: everyone is free to use it to transact and to store value, and it is regulated with mathematical certainty and transparency. Sure, there are some growing pains, and we should deal with them honestly and thoughtfully.

Same shit.
Also, some of the alleged claims are certainly part of buttcoin or SA propaganda campaigns.
Bitcoin is very safe, unless you use it on the same devices you install crap on without any consideration, or unless you click on all the links in your emails.

At this stage, the best pitch is not "accept bitcoin" but "accept payments through Bitcoin network (in addition to Visa, Amex, etc.)" This is much less scary to decision makers, and better depicts what's going on.
You price things in USD. The refund policy clearly states that refunds are in USD. Whether these transactions go through ACH or Visa or Bitcoin is not all that important. Sure, Bitcoin can do much more than this, and already does for p2p trades, but that's the current reality for big retailers.

The creator of the document can PGP-sign it, and include the signature.

I wasn't missing that point, but was pointing to a bigger point. Ultimately, the PBOC policy interferes with the speculative use, and leaves people with an option to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, with all its advantages.

All exchanges do is matching orders between the participants.
As for "transactions per day" figure - these are the only actual bitcoin transactions, secured and timestamped in the public ledger (block chain).
"Transactions" within exchanges are really just IOUs being exchanged, entries in the exchanges internal database. Until you withdraw bitcoin to the address you control, you don't really transact in bitcoins, but in those IOUs that depend on your trusting the exchange to honor the claim. Just ask people with MtGoxcoins.

1. Yes. Many, if not most, heavy-weight addresses are business-owned.
2. Somewhat true. Both sides are spending time arguing about the significance of *hashing power* in network security, whereas in reality what matters is the total monetary investment in mining hardware and operations. This investment, by design, is driven by bitcoin price, and thus is driven by the significance of Bitcoin. In other words, **the more disruptive Bitcoin gets, the more expensive it becomes to disrupt it**. Centralization of the mining power is another issue, which potentially makes it easy to disrupt Bitcoin.

It would make the discussion and thinking easier if we all agreed on  the terminology. I suggest:
* obfuscating the money trail - *mixing*, or *offshore banking* (the effect  and the risks are the same in this context)
* representing illicit income as legitimate  - *money laundering*
Despite its title, this article does not talk about laundering. Bitcoin in itself does not offer any significant advantage in terms of money laundering, on the contrary. While cash-intensive businesses (car wash, restaurant) can be used to launder money by injecting dirty cash and showing it in the books as legitimate transactions), Bitcoin is problematic due to block chain entries being public.

Why don't you simply calculate volatility and correlate with the "market cap" or at least see how it changes over time? Pick a time window and other parameters beforehand, of course, so you avoid cheating yourself by beating it until it shows what you'd like to see.
You will then see for yourself if volatility is decreasing, and whether "market cap" matters, and to what extent.
Like this, it's just  bunch of anecdotes and wishful thinking.

Much confusion comes from different things being called the same name. Bitcoin is a decentralized network for processing payments and tamper-proofing the payment record. It is also software. It is also the unit of account. It is a protocol. 
Some people accept bitcoin, and exchange it only as needed. At this stage it's needed, alright. 
Most people actually use it as a payment processing network for fiat-denominated trades, much like PayPal or Visa.
Also, don't forget those who only announce that they are accepting it in order to create buzz and get free advertising for their companies.
As (if?) adoption continues to grow, the prevalence of these groups will change. The more services and goods - and especially commodities - become available for btc, the less need for intermediate exchange to fiat.
Bitcoin has proven to be a robust and secure technology. It is now time to start building the economy and applications. Lots of work ahead.

Seriously, though, there is no surprise there. The efficiency of mining hardware is improving, and as value of coins is surging (on the weekly and monthly scale, which drives decisions), people are more willing to put money into mining hardware.

Keypairs/addresses are meant to be used once and archived. Do not make it more complicated than that. If you really insist on physical representation:
Visit  save the Web page.
If extra paranoid, check that sha256 of the file matches what you see in the address bar, or even compare with the github version.
Disconnect the PC from the network, reboot (if extra paranoid, boot into a Linux from live CD), open saved Web page, and generate paper "wallet". Optionally, use the passphrase encryption (think this through, though).
Print it directly on a home printer, ideally an older kind without networking capability. Ideally, use a pigment-based inkjet.
Power down the PC and the printer.
Cut and fold your "wallets". If desired, take them to a UPS/Kinko/whatever store and have them laminated (priv keys are not visible anyway). If extra paranoid, place aluminum foil inserts around the private key fold before lamination.
You are now done, with very little risk.

This is terribly misleading. Please don't use the "solve complex problems" fallacy, you obviously know better.
The purpose of the calculation is to determine the digest (a unique fingerprint of sorts) of the recently broadcast transactions, and to timestamp them and enter them into a public ledger in a way that makes it mathematically immutable and tamper-proof. **That** is the purpose of mining calculations, and that is what miners do.

Exactly. The unpleasant experience you are having is related to Bitstamp as a company that handles your fiat.

This right here is one more example of how terribly bad the name blockchain.info is. They **need to rebrand their business**.
People routinely confuse the Bitcoin block chain - a public ledger of transactions - with one business that named themselves *blockchain*. And people then, as we see here, think that if that one Website is down, *the whole Bitcoin ecosystem goes away*. Don't blame them, blame blockchain.info.

*Of course* the first reactions involve "Ponzi", "scam", "developers can just change the code to make more coins", "the CEO of Bitcoin", etc. It's not easy, even for smart people. Imagine the average! Now add to this that they suddenly get hundreds of obviously orchestrated requests in their inboxes, and red flags are flying high.

@_date: 2014-01-14 18:50:50
I totally agree, but I also add the reality of regulation, compliance, etc. Sadly, most bitcoiners choose to ignore it or bitch about it, rather than acting to adapt their government's policy to better accomodate precisely the beauty of Bitcoin you described.

Your ISP can see all your bitcoin connections. If you broadcast a transaction you did not receive, it means you created it. In other words, your ISP (or anyone with access to their infrastructure, or anyone with access to your router) can distinguish between relayed and original transactions from your node.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:33:09
Correct. As I said, using a full-node wallet in the user-friendly manner exposes to the public the fact that there are likely coins behind that IP.
Next, with conspiring ISPs - or anyone else listening in on your traffic - it is trivial to determine that you have not received a tx you just relayed, thus indicating that it was your transaction.
I understand that additional layers can help obfuscate all this to some extent, but we are talking plain-and-simple use cases here.

Again, without infrastructure, miners, coders, exchanges - the value would inevitably collapse. Just think of the recent bugs with database and chain forking, now malleability, and much more serious bugs few years ago. It takes work to make it all work all the time.

I took the claim literally - the minister and his pals think that banks cannot "use bitcoin". They don't anyway. 
If this means banks can and will check the purpose of every transaction and decline to process those they determine have something to do with Bitcoin, we get to a strange situation where Bitcoin is treated as, for example, illegal trade in heroin or plutonium.

For fuck's sake, Bitcoin is not deflationary. 
The supply of bitcoins is subject to pre-decided, verifiable, and democratic inflation that will be slowly diminishing over many years towards a long-term value of zero.
Inflation or deflation of *prices* of goods or services expressed in XBT will depend on a number of factors that are mostly unpredictable. Over the past four months we've had XBT-denominated proces *inflating*, not deflating.
The value of something is determined in the market. You could express that value in terms of anything else, XBT included. Yes, the value of those other things is likely to change on you as you go. Live with it. Gamble on it if you like. Just quit fucking bitching over a non-issue, and quit the academic bullshit.

Comparison to bank cards is not appropriate. These cards can only be used to transact in a way that is regulated and monitored by the governments. Thus, there is no need to declare them at the border because all the transactions are declared anyway. 
With cash or bitcoin private keys, one can liquidate them abroad in a person-to-person fashion, thus circumventing the AML mechanisms, which is the reason behind the requirement to declare cash or equivalents.

No. Hashing power has price attached to it. You *pay* for it - and for power and operating cost - just like everybody else. 
Network hash rate is an irrelevant number in the end - *of course* it will increase when we have a technology leap from CPU to GPU to ASIC. *Of course* it will increase or decrease when people rush in or out driven by variations in real or expected price of XBT. Again, there is nothing astronomical about hash rate numbers today. They are likely to seem ridiculously low in a year from now.

Assume for a second that the exchanges were not perfectly efficient.
Or assume for a second they were not needed, as people trade goods and services for bitcoin. Bitcoins in circulation then roughly represent the value placed on those goods and services, and on the ability to transact (tx fees are also paid in bitcoin). The value is much bigger than zero, even if nobody is "holding it" as a speculative investment.
In reality, its value is based on both.

It was mostly a niche technology for dorks, quite inconvenient to use, prone to malicious hacks, and I was one of the few who discovered its use beyond sexting, flaming, and chain mail: cross-border, instant exchange of information. Telephone was still much better, and paper envelope had a lot more appeal in most cases.

What if one uses bitcoin network and exchanges in two countries to exchange and transfer money internationally?
For example, instead of exchanging and transfering between Canada and the US via banks or Western Union, one buys bitcoin for CAD and immediately sells the same amount for USD, and withdraws USD to the bank account?
What if, in the process, one takes advantage of exchange rates different from those at the bank or WU, thus realizing profit?
Another question: what about btc-denominated investments, dividends, and gains? One purchased shares for 10 btc, sold them later for 100 - how is this treated?

While I appreciate the positive, can-do attitude, I am still uncomfortable with attempts to fix the system by relying less on math and design and more on humans and politics.
Bitcoin is a technology. It ought to work by design as much as possible, and rely on humans and trusting humans as little as possible.
The economics and politics of mining are obviously a weak point that has not been thought through thoroughly from the beginning.
I do not see **any** way Bitcoin in its current state can capture any relevant fraction of international trade, account settlement, store-of-value, anything - with the insecurity and opaqueness in the mining landscape that we see today.

I get all that. I'd add that transacting in bitcoin is, *in principle*, simpler and safer than transacting through credit card networks. Not just cheaper. Anyone listening in on your Internet communications can capture and use credit card number and personal info, but they can't do anything with your Bitcoin traffic (other than, maybe, see what you are buying). 
I don't agree that there were "massive" breaches of security. Several businesses failed, most notably MtGox. Several scams were pulled off, from Bruce Wagner to Trandon Shavers. Bitcoins have been stolen from several exchanges. None of that was related in any technical way to the Bitcoin protocol or even infrastructure. I am surprised that no major pools have been hacked and taken over for nefarious purposes yet. Overall, Bitcoin has proven resilient, and in fact the kinds of breaches you were thinking of only prove that Bitcoin works well, and that bitcoins are valuable.

Most of behavior ridiculed in that post is justified because *Bitcoin is still an experiment*. Indeed, we do not have a good analogy to make with any prior technological breakthroughs, their adoption curves, consequences, and pitfalls.
Perhaps the only attitude worth ridiculing is that of overconfident statements of *any* kind. The fact is, we don't know how this is going to play out even in the two-year span, let alone distant future. There are many soft, human factors at play.

If you do the math and be reasonable, you'll see that most early adopters likely mined or bought hundreds or *maybe* a few thousand coins. Most of them were spent one way or another.

The size of block chain is *not* an issue, and never will be.
Blocks are generated at a linear rate over time, and their maximum size is limited. Thus, the total size of the block chain can only grow linearly with time. Even if block size limit is increased in the future, this is still true from that point on.
The cost of data storage, on the other hand, has been dropping exponentially with time. This has remained so from punch cards to tape to hard disks. I am not going to call it a *law* - even if Moore himself wanted me to - but this observation indicates that the incentive to provide the ever cheaper and better storage is too strong to fail.
I'll bet my coins this will remain so in the future. The total cost of storing block chain will generally *decrease* over time.

Bitcoin is a protocol (and many other things). "Bitcoin Core" is only one of the programs capable of communicating via Bitcoin protocol.
Besides, updates of Bitcoin Core are not "pushed" - many people review the source, and compile it by themselves. Some of them even tweak it to their liking.
Your concern is not without merit, but it's not that big of a deal. There is a healthy intersection of paranoia and competence in the community.

If I understood correctly:
Imagine major financial institutions of the world running their systems using MtGox engine from 2012. Now imagine the Internet neutrality is also gone, and gone in some complicated ways - who pays more gets more bandwidth, but there may also be some political and other factors at play.
Everybody panicking, placing orders.
Trade engines stalling, order execution slowing down, backlogs piling up. We've seen it in the Bitcoin world, right?
Now add to this that, as 'net neutrality is gone and the available bandwidths are insufficient given the scale of the panic, the actual timing of orders arriving to already broken engines starts getting chaotic.
Panic orders are placed based on randomly delayed market data, and are placed in a randomly shuffled order. Each trading institution is thus FUBAR, but it gets worse with arbitrage robots spreading the chaos between the institutions.

This thread is rife with dangerous misconceptions.
Bitcoin supply is inflationary, and will continue to be so for a long time.
The supposed "deflation" in terms of prices denominated in XBT is not a law of the universe, nor a mathematical fact; as we've seen over the past four months, exactly the opposite can and does happen.
When Bitcoin economy is growing - including the store-of-value and speculative aspects - the value of XBT will rise; when the economy is shrinking, the value will fall. *Of course* we've seen mostly an increase during this early adoption stage, however there is absolutely no guarantee this will remain so tomorrow, next week, or over the next five or 15 years.
Markets for loaning/borrowing XBT will evolve, and will simply be based on people gambling on the value of XBT going up or down over this or that period of time. Someone will always get the short end of the stick, in the Captain Hindsight sense.
It is amazing to see people who feel that Bitcoin is "flawed" justify their position by assuming that Bitcoin will magically always continue to grow and proliferate despite the supposed flaw.

The very fact that they are able to "watch for coins" makes me ask this serious question: **what fungibility??**
There is no fungiblity. Bitcoin transactions have their histories written in a public ledger. That is one of the fundamental details of the technology. Face the reality, and either embrace Bitcoin for what it really is, or move on to something else that is more fungible if it's really that important to you.  Also, quit telling others what to do, especially when it involves closing their eyes and pretending that "bitcoins are fungible".

What if each country starts regulating it to their own advantage, including telling miners what transactions they can and cannot process (already done with fiat services)? What if the others suddenly seize 55% of hash power, even if temporarily? Whay about the small guys? What about collusion?
While "in math we trust" sounds cute, the fact is that mining brings too much politics into the mix. It's not just math.

As I wrote, the metrics are different. I didn't care about those extra few bucks for electricity. The time I spent was not considered a cost, because *it was a hobby*. The rent or mortgage was already being paid anyway, so zero cost there.
You are right in one other way, though: a mining farm (privately operated, or operated by a co-operative of people like you and me) is more efficient in procuring or making their own ASIC hardware. As far as operating costs, I still claim individual mining at home at a small scale is unbeatable, because most of the cost is irrelevant.

Mining at home as a profitable (or not) hobby will always be more efficient than the "mining farm" business, because incentives and metrics are completely different.
The issue of mining pools, and the centralization they bring about, is related to the variance, not the efficiency. A related issue is the lack of getblocktemplate implementations.

Bitcoin gets big, mining gets regulated as a payment-processing activity - because that's what it is. Black lists, white lists, etc. 
Just like today you might be under economic sanctions and thus seeking shady, offshore banks willing to move your money, you might be looking for miners willing to try to include your transaction in the block chain. Hash rate becomes an issue, as most technologically advanced countries today also tend to be heavy-handed with AML, trade sanctions,  etc.
Here's a hint of what's to come: even today mining is not "automatic" - it already hapenned that miners reject transactions on the ideological basis (satoshi dice). Also, mining is already not decentralized in practice. I agree it is trustless, though, because miners may reject transactions, but they cannot seize funds (in contrast with legacy banking system).

I cannot see how Bitcoin in its present form, with all uncertainty related to mining, can capture any significant portion of international trade, account settlement, or store-of-value.

First of all, I have not yet contacted researchers directly to confirm that they indeed are behind the fundraising campaign we see here. I would definitely do so before considering a donation. In the meantime, some thoughts and impressions:
I cannot tell what it is specifically that my money would be funding. All I see on Onarbor are papers and posters about research *already carried out*.
As much as I love the idea of exploring the possibilities for global crowdfunding of research using Bitcoin, I am disappointed that any researcher would dare asking for funds without providing specific commitments and plans.
What is it that you are promissing to do with my money? What experiments will be done, and how? What materials will be used? How will the data be collected and processed?
What are the risks? What are the possible outcomes of each experiment, and how will these outcomes determine subsequent steps?
Again, I like the idea, and I would definitely consider supporting research in this way - as long as commitments and responsibilities are clearly defined.
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:48:01

Excuse my ignorance, and ELI5:
When a fund of this kind "holds" an asset - bitcoin, gold, whatever real asset - how do invostors know they actually hold it?
Furthermore, why would anyone invest in such a fund? Is it about registered accounts with favorable tax implications?
Finally, how does it work - money gets invested, the funds goes to the marlet and purchases bitcoin? Someone cashes out, the fund operator sells some of the holdings? Is that the essence?

Again, clearly, they are **not** stealing bitcoins. They are stealing computational power, then using it to generate new bitcoins.


This is a problem with Internet routing, not with Bitcoin per se.

@_date: 2014-03-06 00:27:10
So, now we've got bitcoins, goxcoins, and blockchaininfocoins...
Also, they cause lots of confusion in general public with their name. Really should stay away from "blockchain" or any other terminology related to the protocol. Here we have a **blockchain transaction which did not make it into the blockchain**.
Finally, their graphs are terrible - no digit grouping, useless clutter of decimal places, often no idea if data is binned into hours or days or blocks...

They are already receiving only half of what they used to get two years ago, and this will be cut in half again in about two years from now.

Yes, that takes care of the general public - *anyone* - being able to trace the coins, and leaves us with unfair, privileged, asymmetrical power to access the required information. Strangely, the community seems to prefer giving unfair advantage to select powerful entities over destroying the advantage by keeping everything public and transparent.
That's the only real choice we are facing.
P.S. I am not 100% convinced I am right, but Bitcoin has been pushing my thinking in this direction.

That's a rather rigid approach to life. What you describe might be best in some cases, but it might be a bad idea in other cases.
To provide an extremely different point of view for your consideration: in this case you don't care what people want, or what might make them spend a bit more (hah!). You care to change the thinking of your customers, and of everybody else, too. Recall that overquoted H. Ford statement, about asking people what they want...
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:43:15
Right, so it's not quite "public information" and "blockchain". You need to set up (currently) thousands of specialized nodes, and you need to assume that miners wishing to remain anonymous are stupid enough to connect to your nodes indiscriminately and directly, and not do what you did.

Then why are you referring to a thread where rate of theft is reported from a coin's perspective?
What do you mean by "many" users? Is it 20% of all people who ever used Bitcoin, or 0.1% or what?
Finally, we don't know what happened to MtGox coins. They were in all likelyhood lost due to negligence. Maybe stolen by thieves from MtGox, which would be exactly *one* user. Sure, many people depended on that one Bitcoin user who screwed up one way or another, but it is absolutely not that case that all those users' PCs and phones and paper wallets were somehow hacked and their coins stolen. They were not.

I agree, it is confusing at first.
The difficulty should be put into perspective, however. Describe honestly to yourself what it takes for a neophyte to learn all the basics and to start using a credit card. Realistically, there are many weeks of hard learning and hard work ahead, and the learning curve is quite steep and full of expensive lessons. And yet, credit cards are widely adopted.
I am not being dismissive of your concern - it is valid, and requires all of us to get to work and make things better, simpler, clearer, more secure, and more accessible to as many people in this world as possible.

Half of the players were annoyed as their piles were seeping over to mine, the other half were laughing with me in disbelief as their chips were melting away... Finally I stood up, donated the winnings back randomly, and walked away.
For some people, there's more to life than price tags and dollars and bitcoins and seeing oneself as a "pro" or a "winner". For others, there's nothing else. The real distinction is between those who see and respect how something different from their own attitude might work for others, and those who are convinced that their views are universal truths: "human nature", "people/markets/governments will always...", "everybody just wants money" and other such bullshit.

Yes, I'd love to hear it from the industry insiders. It's clear why it's slow in case of net periodic settlement systems, but I don't understand why real-time gross settlement systems seem to be reserved for high-value transactions. It's not like CPU power is a bottleneck nowadays.

I would avoid explaining mining mainly in terms of "solving difficult problems". This leads to all sorts of misconceptions.
First of all, it is one specific, clearly defined, verifiable calculation, not just some "difficult" or "complex" "calculations".
Next, it serves a specific useful purpose: it verifies, timestamps, and seals the new transactions into the ledger in a tamper-proof way. Sure, it takes computational work to get the desired result, and there is no shortcut, but *this is not the only important point*, as explained above.

They could indeed rely on the block chain and the miners to keep track of their own transactions in different locations, but why would they? They might as well keep using their internal, closed ledger to achieve the same, without having to worry about forks, hacks of mining pools, etc.

It's a very different technology from Bitcoin. We have one unit of account - XBT - which is all we transact. Of course premining XBT would be unacceptable. Ripple enables you to transact in any arbitrary IOUs (including bitcoin IOUs). Transactional tokens XRP are simply there to prevent tx spam. It's not a unit of account. Using the term "pre-mined" is misguided, as there is no mining in Ripple.

As much as I appreciate Scheier's insights, I dislike seeing them public at this stage.
If the FBI written testimony (or whatever it's technically called) really is false, I want to be able to hope to see those responsible prosecuted. If NSA tools were abused - and jeoparized - for issues unrelated to national security, like taking down SR, I want to be able to hope to see those responsible prosecuted.
Publicizing holes in the FBI story at this stage only enables those responsible to prepare their defense and justifications. Just shut up and keep analyzing. If you are one of those who appreciate what DPR was doing (I myself am not sure), and are capable of analysis like Schneier, consider delivering your findings privately to DPR defense team.

Obsessing over hash rate is misguided and ultimately pointless. *Of course* it shoots up with technological leaps.
What really matters is not the total hashing power, but the total investment of the mining industry - the total cost of the hardware and electricity. If it costs a few million USD to take over the network, we've got a problem. If it takes a hundred million, we've got less of a problem - especially with the obvious incentive to mine honestly and earn value instead of burning your cash to try to disrupt the Bitcoin transaction processing for a while.
One of the many ingenious details in Bitcoin is that the cost of nefarious disruption of the mining network is proportional to the total valuation of bitcoin supply (I hate the term "market cap"), and thus it is proportional to the incentive to disrupt the network.
Nevertheless, we should not forget that certain entities in modern world have practically unlimited supply of fiat up their sleeves. Do not step on their toes too early.

It is only important in the context of certain assumptions. For example, that moving coins will end in the open market; or that simplistic math of "market cap" makes any sense.
There is some circular logic involved: it is important because you assume it is important. The fact is, you have no idea - perhaps somebody moved their old coins so they could cash out a tiny fraction and buy a car or a house or pay a medical bill. Perhaps they will do so by selling privately. Perhaps they are just upgrading their security by moving to a modern RNG.

This is a good question that comes up a lot. Fortunately, it is based in the wrong assumption that "mining gets more and more expensive for everyday people."
Mining is as accessible to anyone as it's always been. You don't need a whole rig to mine; invest in a mining company or a co-op. Also, it is wrong to assume that only $20k rigs will be an option - look at the USB ASICMINER. Sure, it was not profitable because the price was inflated, but that same situation applies to many rigs that were ordered from this or that vendor. Big players were not in any particular advantage. 
As for the efficiency of small vs. large equipment - this is again nothing new: back in the GPU days you were mining happily with two GPUs on a desktop, competing against bare-bone GPU rigs out there.

Surprisingly, the next day your money is gone.

Your logic and math are applicable to the legacy system, not so much to Bitcoin.

The technology and the know-how to make hashing ASICs is out there. Improvements are incremental and slow, breakthroughs are highly unlikely.
Making ASICs is a matter of NRE and production cost. Running them is a matter of the cost of electricity and facilities overhead. Overall, it is a matter of total cost, and that's where you would be competing with others, not the hashrate which is by itself a meaningless, derived factor.

Next, we should ask ourselves if it would be better to devote efforts of additional developers to new implementations, or to checking and developing the Core implementation.
What do you think?

Why consider the "coin" amount (100,000,000 satoshis), and not something else? There is nothing special about that unit versus any other amount in this context.
Why not triplets of coins, or a dozen bits, or 2^22 satoshis?

The statement in the title is rather simplistic. There is much more going on.

@_date: 2014-10-05 19:40:02
My point exactly, and it is based in facts. The myth of "many early adopters cashing out" does not even add up mathematically. Most early adopters - even those from the days of CPU mining and 58xx GPUs - have mined a couple of hundreds of coins. Most of it has been spent, exchanged, rebought, and donated many times by now. 
The myth is that anyone involved with Bitcoin in 2010 or 2011 must have amassed "thousands" of coins without any risk and effort, and actually held on to them throughout all the highs and lows and news and life-changing events and HDD reformats and whatnot.
It's bullshit. 
Most of present-day big holders are not those "early adopters". 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:58:42
Not quite so, because simply buying bitcoins does nothing for the Bitcoin economy. They choose to work to build the infrastructure, improve user experience, promote further adoption, and ensure an acceptable regulatory environment is in place.

By definition, Ponzi will use new participants' investments *to deliver as promised* to previous participants, thus drawing more new participants in...
What you are describing is simply a scam, not Ponzi.
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:14:39
Can you be more specific? What exact scenario are you proposing?
For example, *the value of bitcoin drops suddenly*.  As miners' direct revenue is denominated in bitcoins, this would mean their earned value has dropped suddenly. No need to speculate what this would mean - it happened several times before. What happened to the network?
Any other scenarios?
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:27:14
It isn't. Miners either avoid risk and sell as they mine regardless of price, or hold as much as possible with speculative hopes/fears. Either way, newly issued coins typically represent only 5-10% of the global trade volume on public exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:46:33

It is sad to see bitcoiners, of all people, show such a terrible lack of understanding of Ripple, how it works, and the role of XRP within Ripple.
Ripple is the 21st century Hawala. It lets you trade instantly any IOUs in a global market - from dollars to bitcoins to gold to goods and services.
Ripple could be a great enabler of Bitcoin, but unfortunately most of us are too ignorant and stupid to even try to learn about Ripple and give it a try. Also, too much focus on XRP.

*Of course* you can try to obfuscate your cash flow, with mixers, Tor, offshore banks, VPNs, cash-intense businesses, etc. - but these attempts have nothing to do with Bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2014-06-27 22:03:52
Excellent points.
It is important to remove confusion from these discussions by insisting on the distinction between numbers and objects we sometimes use to represent them (or objects that we are representing/counting). If I merged two piles of marbles representing the addition in my example above, it would certainly be possible to track which marble went where afterwards.
With bitcoin, there are no marbles. There are no objects - "bitcoins" we are counting, "bitcoin" is merely an abstract unit we decided to append to the number we keep track of in the ledger.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:32:24
The facts indicate exactly the opposite. Most serious problems have been caused by external actions, not by Gox's own incompetence.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:35:32
Good point. That would require lots of work and collusion on the scammer's side, though. 
Lots of mining power with an anonymous entity. If broken down into smaller operations, the overhead cost goes up. Next, they need to establish a business connection that will lead to a significant amount or coins being spent by them for an irrevocable good or service, while still maintaining anonymity. Finally, they need to pull off the double spend, hoping that the mining landscape has not changed significantly. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:50:14

Yes, especially if you are willing to take a small risk of gain or loss due to market fluctuations during the process (unfortunately, the process involves conversion from and to fiat, so it might take hours or days - the bitcoin transfer itself is secure and irreversible withing tens of minutes).
You customer wants to pay $10,000.
You check with your exchange (CAVirtEx, Vault of Satoshi, LocalBitcoins, Mycelium, Bitstamp) to figure out the exchange rate. This will require some work - account for their fees and even slippage (look at the order book on VirtEx, for example). In the end, you want to make sure you actually would get $10,000 worth at this moment. A spreadsheet can automate this.
You inform your customer of the XBT amount they owe you, and for how long it is valid (a day?). When you receive the coins, you can exchange them or keep them. You might want to consider keeping a typical transaction's worth of coins with a reputable exchange, so you can start selling as you are receiving coins from Russia.
All in all, it's not trivial, but definitely worth looking into.
Finally, and most importantly: talk to your accountant about how to treat these kinds of transactions in your books, tax implications and opportunities, etc.
@_date: 2014-09-02 06:03:58
Suppose the price of bitcoin stays the same, or drops lower. Some of the miners give up mining as unprofitable, but the rest not only keep mining for the bigger piece of pie, but continue to compete with each other by adding more hardware (some of it likely bought off of those who gave up).

1. Exactly the opposite. Credit card transactions are subject to reversal ("chargeback") for many months. In other words, it takes half a year to *confirm* a credit card transaction.
2. Why would mining become "no longer profitable"? For as long as there is Bitcoin network, there will be money to be made from transaction fees and block rewards. Also, *difficulty* takes care of it by design.
3. Again, not true. The network scales wonderully for all practical and realistic purposes. See [this recent discussion]( or the [Wiki entry](
4. I agree. More research and development work is needed in that area.

It looks nice, but everyone should be reminded that Bitcoin by design assumes that private keys are used only once. Reusing keys/addresses is certainly possible, but it does have security implications.
Also, everyone should be reminded that third-party created keys are only as secure as the BIP38 password, whereas DIY BIP38 keys are as secure as the password **and** the random 256-bit number.

If you do the math, and reality checks, you'll be surprised by the fact that most early adopters never had a chance to mine and keep more than a few hundreds coins.
Imagine you were one of the only 800 people, **in the whole world**, who knew about Bitcoin at some point. How long did it take for that number to turn into 8,000, thus crowding you out from the mining opportunity? Assume an average of 1/1000 piece of pie, for amazing six months. That's 7.2 coins per day, for 180 days.
Now imagine you got in that early, mined, perhaps even bought at $0.80 by mailing that cash to a guy in Kansas - and then it hit an amazing $15 per coin! Would you have spent some? Would most people do so? Then imagine it's hit the $30, then a series of confidence-shaking disasters started unfolding. It's $18. It's $11. You can still cash out and get significant value out of it. It's $8. Months go by. It's $4. How many reasonable early adopters would still take profits there, rather than risk total loss?
The fact is, vast majority of early adopters never got as rich as not-so-early adopters love to imagine.

As your business grows, there will inevitably be more returns (I guess mostly from people not doing the measurement properly). Please update your return policy to clarify what "return your money" means. I presume you would be refunding bitcoins based on the exchange rate at the time of the return, but maybe you choose to refund the btc amount paid. Either way, make it clear.

50 xbt per block meant 7,200 xbt per day. If you were an average miner out of only 1,000 people mining in the whole world, you would have earned an average of 7.2 xbt per day. 
Another perspective is that you could have had brains and balls to throw $300 into the system after all the disasters and an apparent end of Bitcoin in 2011. And that you had brains and balls not to spend it at 10x, 20x, 50x profit.

You are simply replacing local storage of a private key with local storage of a passphrase. In doing so, you are also exposing the encrypted private key to attacks in the context of the strength of your passphrase. To mitigate the risk, you will want to make passphrase a long and random string, thus making it look painfully close to a private key you started with.
Overall, a waste of time and brain power.

Nework security is related to the total mining investment, not to the hash power which changes with hardware efficiency.

Doesn't make my mattress dollars a bank either.
Look, I love this revolutionary innovation which is Bitcoin. It's just all this oblivion of many bitcoiners that really annoys me.
Bitcoin in and of itself does not deal with freedom, banks, governments, taxes - it's a technology. There can be Bitcoin banks. There can be fractional reserves. There can be capital gains and losses, and related taxes owed. There can be bugs. There can be backdoors. There can be miners offering exclusive contracts for your transactions. There can be regulation of mining, much like money transmittance. There can be tracking of consumer habits. There can be tools to try to avoid tracking.
These are issues mostly related to politics, business, ideology, geography, culture. 
Bitcoin technology lets anyone do amazing things not possible before. Do not be naive thinking that it only works for you, and not for the kinds of people you dislike.

This often neglected:
You hold a significant amount of XBT.
You spend some of it, or invest new dollars into the endeavor that makes Bitcoin technology more accessible, secure, and useful to the masses.
You work hard. You plan, you innovate, you learn from mistakes.
If your endeavor is a success, your XBT holdings will end up worth more. Potentially *much* more in this case.
As a side note, you could use these same XBT holdings as an insurance to your customers against theft of your hot wallets. You therefore actually have an incentive to keep auditing and securing your system against theft.
This, in one form or another, is the only way forward, folks. Don't just sit on your paper wallets and wish and pray for miraculous $2k or $40k or $1M a coin. Wishing won't make it happen.
Get to work. Lead by example. Help Bitcoin become the best it could be. Earn it, spend it, give it away, show how it could be useful in this or that scenario, show how it cannot help in some cases. Code, debug, design, share, sell, buy, clear away the confusion, debunk the myths, be aware of your own biases...

You are already [causing a problem]( much more real than what you describe above


Blocks are generated at an average rate of one block per 10 minutes. The maximum block size is limited by design. Therefore, the block chain size can only grow linearly with time. It is impossible for it to grow "faster than Moore's Law" which describes an exponential growth (or exponential decay of the cost of data storage). Even if we increase the block size limit in the future, my statement remains true from that point on.

While I use paper wallets, proliferation of their use bothers me. Frequent consolidation of one's funds in one single address is a disaster for privacy. Add to this the transaction change being sent back to one and only originating address in Mycelium, and you get the world where even mediocre actors can trivially deduce a lot of information about their trade partners.

By "blockchain" you mean company running the Website *blockchain.info*, or the timestamp in the actual blockchain (the Bitcoin ledger)?
Blockchain.info reports their time when they heard the transaction broadcast. If you trust their competence, this is your best bet.
The blockr may be reporting the timestamp that was embedded in the block by the miner who created the block - this may be off by several hours from the UTC.
What really matters is the block number. That's your "timestamp". Everything else gets messy.

If I had a bit every time a scientist claims "a breakthrough" that is forgotten two years later. Academics are the worst, but for-profit companies follow closely in the amount of biased or outright fraudulent "scientific" claims. Whatever is left is subject to business/management failures, and whatever is left then *might* turn out as an actual product.
Just go back a few years and dig out spectacular press releases of this kind, then follow up. Where is all that world-changing stuff? I thought HP was making memristor computers since 2012, and more recently producing amazing, game-changing 3D printing facilities since last summer.

Coincidentally, these same people are prone to transformations that lead them down the path of extreme substance abuse and otherwise reckless behavior, nipples and beer and everything.

It was 50 per block, right?
    50*6*24 = 7,200 coins per day
If you were an average of one of the thousand identical miners in the whole world, you were getting an average of 7.2 coins per day. Since you were mining 600 per day on a CPU, I'd say you were there when only 10 or 20 CPUs were mining in the whole world, which would be 2009, or *maybe* early 2010. By summer 2010, GPU mining started spreading. Anyhow, I wouldn't consider you an "early adopter" - being one of the 20 people in the whole world makes you... we need a new term here, definitely...
Your story also confirms the expected - most early coins that were not lost have already changed hands.

That's not the public key; that is a ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)), with a checksum- also known as "address". They need to first reverse-calculate this double trapdoor, and only then can they start reverse-calculating the 256-bit  ecdsa privkey.

That is the point. To complete the picture, it should be noted that only US banks can operate USD-denominated accounts. Even when you open a USD account abroad, it is actually a US bank holding and moving the funds somewhere, with the ability to seize or freeze the funds at any time.

Nothing in this world is totally fungible in it self. Not gold, not cash, not oil, not even electricity actually delivered by some means. It is simply a matter of agreement to treat something as fungible. You cannot force people to do so. Voluntary agreement. There is always *some* information available - certain people just agree to ignore it, because that is overall a better option. Even then, they might also agree to change their minds in certain cases, for example when dealing with stolen property.
Based solely on its technological properties, bitcoin transactions are not perfectly fungible. A fact many here dislike. Yes, at their heart Bitcoin transactions with multiple inputs and outputs make it impossible to track flow between mulitple transactions with certainty, but still there is taint, and still there is the initial spend of "coins of interest" that miners need to accept and the receiver needs to notice.

It's a steganographic... no, wait - it's a *steganosonic* representation of an encrypted private key. Encrypted by another private datum we call "passphrase", which is not encrypted. If memorized, it is likely not secure enough. If it is stored securely, we might as well store securely the original private key and cut the bullshit instead of cutting vinyl (in fact, polycarbonate in this case).
P.S. no human ear/brain can extract the steganosonic information as used here without *visualizing* it first - thus reverting back to good, old steganography, and poorly implemented for that matter.

All it means is that that 1% was valued at 1 million. It is rather simplistic to just multiply that by 100 and to claim the result is the value of the company. Try selling it, and see what happens: chances are it will not end up being 100 million.

If stolen, they must have been moved to the thief's address. We did not see this in the blockchain.
Furthermore, this implies strongly that a "bitcoin bug" was used to steal the coins. This is impossible, as no other major holders were robbed in this period - or ever, for that matter - using the supposed "bitcoin bug". The bug must be related to Gox internals.

Because, in some cases, paying with bitcoin is simpler and faster than with fiat. I bought some coins once, and can now spend them when I feel like it.
A subscription to an online service or content - assuming I trust the provider enough, bitcoin is better than cc in every way. Hell even if I *don't* quite trust the provider to provide quality service, would I then trust them with all the personal info I have to supply just to pay with credit card?
A quick donation or a tip - again, no signing up with PayPals, flattrs, whatever. Simple. Send the bits. Done. No worries, no monthly statements, no deadlines, no stolen data, no rejected transactions or even closed accounts because "suspicious activity"...

Wr should be careful to explain things clearly here. If your transaction had *n* confirmations before the zero-tx block, where *n*&gt;0, it will have *n*+1 confirmations with that block. Not a problem. Zero-tx blocks still secure the system.
You might claim that mining zero-tx blocks on purpose delays the *initial* confirmation of transactions until the non-zero-tx block is mined. I don't like it, but it's not really a problem unless that miner, or a mining cartel, controls large majority of the total hashing power, and continues to do so.

No idea about the "796.com", but from the title and the comments I conclude they simply link to an address associated with certain amount of funds. 
First of all, a message should be signed using this address to prove the ownership by "796".
This is a step in the right direction. While cold storage is not impossible to steal, if properly implemented it is very secure. Thus, "transparent cold storage" is a form of deposit insurance - and a very cost-efficient one, for that matter.

Each trade has two or more parties to it. For every participant "getting rid" of bitcoin, there is someone acquiring it. Seeing as the bitcoin supply is predetermined and secure from counterfitting, your logic applies both ways and is perfectly balanced in this simple consideration. The value will not trend down any more that it will trend up when people use bitcoin. Again, the value is determined by the value of the economy it is supporting.

Besides what is already proposed here by others, consider simply running Mycelium on a cheap, dedicated phone or tablet. You can set the currency and the source of the exchange data, and you are done:
1. Enter the sale into your cash register as usual
2. Type the amount into Mycelium (tap currency symbol to switch if you haven't already), this will generate and display the QR code
3. Instead of giving you cash, the customer scans the code and makes the payment, you see it right away as unconfirmed, incoming transaction
4. You print the receipt and hand it over, just like you would with cash
The owner can choose to keep the coins, and make up for the cash (effectively buying coins from the customers, and customers spending all that cash at the shop), or (s)he can exchange coins weekly/monthly to balance the books.
Note that the "risk" of volatility goes both ways, with historically greater upside potential.
Also note that bitcoin transactions will be a tiny fraction of overall sales, so this is today less about trivial profit increase, and more about creating the buzz, attracting smart clientele, and exposing yourself to this new and potentially game-changing technology.
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:31:36
When representing data that spans orders of magnitude, log scale is more appropriate. Despite its name, linear scale is distorted.
Using bitcoin speculation as an example, if you bought them at $1 and sold at $2, you have doubled your initial investment. If you bought some at $100 and sold it at $200, you have doubled your investment.
The two cases above, while practically identical (you could have invested $22k and ended up with $44k in both cases), are represented by very different lengths on the y-axis if you use linear scale. In log scale, each unit of length on your screen represents the same relative change in the value you are representing. No information is lost.
Finally, ignore those who tell you how exponential growth appears as a straight line in the log scale. That is true, but completely irrelevant in this discussion.

A full node receives messges about new transactions, makes sure they satisfy certain conditions, then relays them to other nodes.

Trivial, but not without third-party risk: you keep coins in the other exchange. Whenever you buy coins in the first exchange, you immediately sell the same amount in the other. Then you send the bought coins to replenish. Assuming arbitrage players are doing their jobs, the effective exchange rates will be close to the banks' forex rates. 
You still need to fund the fiat account in the first exchange, and to withdraw fiat from the other exchange, so overall the process may not be much faster than a bank wire. All this will get better if more businesses and individuals continue to join the party - no need for fiat at all!

Bitcoin network creates on average six blocks per hour, each providing a block reward currently worth 25 bitcoins. Transaction fees also belong to the miners, but we can ignore it in this rough overview.
So, Bitcoin network generates on average 25 * 6 * 24 = 3,600 new bitcoins per day, which are distributed to the miners in proportion to their contribution to the overall hash rate.
If your hash rate is X, and [network hashrate]( is Y, you are entitled to X/Y of the 3,600 coins per day. That's the average outcome, with some variance. Assuming you will be joining a mining pool to decrease the variance, you need to account for the pool fees. Also account for downtime due to connetivity or hardware problems.
Good luck, and get to work! Understand that overall network hash rate keeps growing, so you need to keep growing if you want to maintain your share of the pie.

Money being discussed here is a red herring. What is at stake is unhindered access to personal data, in the context of DHS efforts. MtGox had to go away.

What primarily gives security in this case is the ECDSA algorithm, not miners mining.

Actually, linear scale is deceptive (with or without zero) because it distorts the relative changes. Log scale is most appropriate: doubling (or tripling) or halving (or thirding) of a price is always represented by the same length, regardless of actual values. That way you can judge volatility or returns equally at any scale.

What he is doing is *based on the non-existence of fungibility in certain kinds of Bitcoin transactions* - he cannot be "destroying" something that doesn't exist. He is simply using Bitcoin technology the way it is.
What *is* fungible are values in multiple input/multiple output transactions (you cannot tell where "7" went in *7+14=13+8*), for example CoinJoin mixers. He wouldn't be able to "destroy" this even if he were silly enough to try. He could analyze the "taint" - but that is again simply using basic mathematics and Bitcoin technology the way it is.

1. Yes, with few important distinctions: Bitcoin supply cannot be arbitrarily diluted or otherwise manipulated, because everybody can and does check the math. Furthermore, there is no one central issuer or a clearing house, and no need to trust anyone or anything other than the math to ensure and confirm ownership of this asset.
2. Transactions are time-stamped and recorded in a tamper-proof, public ledger. Private keys, used to "spend" coins by signing transactions, are stored by the users much like any other valuable information: on hard drives, in printed form, even in brains (not recommended). If you own private keys, you can easily check what funds are or were associated with them in the public ledger; this is how you "keep track" of your money.
3. Bitcoin involves digital information related to private/public keys and addresses, and the public ledger of all transactions. 
I hope this is a good starting point - go ahead and ask more specific questions if needed.

Thank you for taking time to respond patiently. I agree, and I admit I was making a rather irrelevant argument.
I feel that people erroneously assume that it is possible to design proof of work that would be solvable on general-purpose ICs, while being ASIC-proof. This thinking is based on the assumption that ASICs are set in stone (silicon, that is), and cannot adapt to some presumed advanced PoW algorithms. I don't think this is the case in reality. **Any well-defined PoW problem that can be solved by your Turing-complete architecture can be solved more efficiently by the trimmed-down, lean ASIC.**

Chargeback is still an option with bitcoin, just like with dollars or euros - just transact through an escrow party in all cases.

You need to look at the equally big picture when comparing network efficiency - ultimately, even banks have to agree on and reconcile their balances. All of them. That is why it is possible to estimate the money supply. Lots of work there is done by central banks, and even more globally by the "bank of international settlements" and the likes. Besides efficiency there is also the issue of fairness.
Next, hashing is not meaningless crunching of numbers, nor "solving increasingly complex puzzles" as it is often misportrayed.

The size of block chain has a maximum **linear** growth rate defined by the block size limit. Can't grow by more than that every 10 minutes. Even if we raise the limit, the growth will again be linear from that point on.
Bandwidth and storage per dollar, on the other hand, have been growing exponentially over years and decades. 
There will be fluctuations, of course, and we might get unfavorable interplay over some periods, but generally there is no problem if we leave enough of the safety margin when choosing the limit.

Nothing in real world is perfectly fungible. There always will be forensic tools that weaken fungibility and enable identification and thus tracking and comparisons. Gold fingerprinting, block chain + network analysis, banknote serial numbers, magnetic ink, microscopy, whatever.
By designing technologies that enable "strong" privacy in transacting or communicating, we are simply ensuring that a smaller number of entities have resources to crack the system, while we make the data opaque to everyone else. Therefore, the original good intentions result in a more unjust, asymmetrical, exclusive access to data - a competitive advantage of powerful entities over smaller ones.

By investing in a company at an IPO, you are providing capital to be used by that company in their business. By "investing" at a later time, you are providing nothing to the company. Either way, you are typically entitled to a share of profits, and have a voting power in company decisions.
By buying bitcoins, you are not providing any capital for operations of the Bitcoin network, nor are you entitled to profits generated from tx fees, nor are you entitled to any voting in how Bitcoin network operates. You simply own bitcoins, can spend them if you find someone willing to trade, and can *always* use them to pay tx fees.

One one Android device that you trust and keep secure, generate addresses. Export *addresses only* (not the private keys) to other devices with Mycelium wallets that will be used to receive payments. This way nobody needs to worry about employee theft nor employee screwups.
You can set those receiving Myceliums to use BitPay as source of exchange rates. Waiters will simply type in a dollar ammount, and QR will be generated. When the customer pays, they will see an incoming transaction. All done.
You will be able to use funds as you wish and when you wish, for example by sending them to your BitPay account.

Not random at all. Please do not spread that fallacy. 
What is hashed are the certain data about past, confirmed transactions and new transactions, along with a nonce and the miner's address. That is how we get tamper-proof, secure, immutable ledger of time-stamped, digitally signed transactions. That's the point of Bitcoin, and it wouldn't be possible if we "hashed random numbers".
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:55:29

@_date: 2014-03-01 18:44:37
It is about "permanent" physical representations of bitcoin keys in general, implying their re-use, especially with the prices we see for this wood wallet:
(1) Privacy implications - anyone who ever received your address to send you a payment knows this is your address, and can see all future payments to this reused address. I don't care too much about privacy, but I did notice some of my trading partners and friends reusing addresses with *significant* balances associated. I am not comfortable with this, and they shouldn't be either. Say they get kidnapped or blackmailed - I and everyone they ever traded with would be and should be a suspect.
(2) Bitcoin "process flow" is, in simple terms, based on the sequence of one-way, "trapdoor" transformations
    PrivateKey --(ECDSA)--&gt; PublicKey --(ripemd160(sha256())--&gt; Address
Single-use keypairs - they way they are used in the reference client - ensure that your public key is unknown until you spend the associated funds. Thus, the security of your private keys is based on ECDSA **and** the double hash function. Once a keypair has been used to *send* coins somewhere, the public key is available to anyone in the blockchain. The security of the private key then relies on ECDSA alone from that point on. I don't think this is a big deal, but it is best avoided if possible to avoid.  Use your paper/wood/steel/quartz/ wallets as a piggy bank - keep adding funds to them all you want - but once you spend funds from them, store them away and start with a new keypair. The cost of the wood wallet makes this, well, costly.

Trading fees are currently irrelevant in the light of variation of market prices. In other words, the effective fiat/fiat exchange rate when using bitcoin as an intermediary varies by several percent. If you can afford to wait, this might be an arbitrage opportunity. If you are looking for a reliable, always available option, bitcoin is not there yet.
If and when the volume goes up, if and when regulatory environment becomes clearer and friendlier, and more players start equalizing markets by arbitrage, Bitcoin will definitely be useful to lots of people in this way. As it gets useful to more people, it will be getting even better for everyone.

It is silly and ignorant to use hash rate as a metric of network growth in the long run.
The efficiency of hardware (hashes per Joule) and the cost (hashes per second-dollars) have changed orders of magnitude.
One good metric would be the total investment of the mining industry - convert all these hash/s histrical data into USD invested to provide those rates. You'll need historical data on mining hardware cost and energy efficiency. Have fun and be surprised. You are welcome.

That's "server farms" - the one controlling the contents of blocks is the one paying for the operation.
Pooled mining is the opposite in this sense: it puts control over blocks into the hands of pool operator, *who does not pay for hardware nor electricity*. Furthermore, pooled mining is incentivized because it reduces variance for individual "miners" (workers, more precisely).

I am not a billionaire, but even I am capable of evaluating risks and uncertainties related to economics and evolution of bitcoin "mining". 
The presumed "upcoming role in the world finance" depends critically on how, where, and when mining will be regulated. It also depends on how, where, and when block chain data mining and black- and white-listing will start catching up with corporations and governments.
Anyone claiming to know with any degree of certainty how this complex, open-ended experiment will evolve is bullshitting.

Seriously. Take any data that spans several orders of magnitude, for example bitcoin price over several years.
Now plot it in linear scale. You are absolutely unable to notice a significant event, like price doubling from $1 to $2, because that range is visually compressed down in order to accomodate the range of ~$1000.
Now plot it in the log scale. Suddenly, the same relative change in the price is represented by the same vertical distance on your screen. You can see all the data.
Play with it, think about it.

Let's look at this in more detail.
Pools are not made up of individuals. Workers simply provide hashing power to the pool operator (miner), who decides what goes into blocks. Workers have no say. This can and should be changed in the future.
Much like banks, miners can choose what transactions to accept or reject. We already had examples of monetary, but also ideological reasons for rejection of transactions by various pools. Do not be surprised when regulation gets added to the list of reasons.
Unlike banks, miners cannot "freeze" or otherwise steal your assets - they can only deny to include your transaction in the block chain. You can seek miners willing to accept it, just like even DPRK and Iran can find banks willing to process their transactions.

Actually, there are several ways to try and make our views objective.
The simplest way would be to look at the complete picture - *all* the data since exchanges started popping up in ~late 2010. You have to look at it in log scale to see anything and to remain objective. It looks great. Because it is great.
Perhaps a better way would be to also somehow account for the *significance* of price moves by volume weighing, but I cannot think through the exact approach right now as I am riding on the bus, with a beautiful distraction sitting next to me. But we digress.

They mention the risk due to volatility - the value changing while you are "transfering" bitcoins from the Chinese to the offshore exchange. 
This perceived risk is only relevant if you are doing this by yourself, once, with your own money.
Any service (or personal, ongoing scheme) put in place to do this, though, would keep bitcoin funds available on offshore exchanges, so when bitcoins are bought in China, the same amount is immediately sold offshore. Afterwards you can take your time transferring bitcoins to balance accounts. No volatility risk, as transactions are done concurrently, perhaps staged if order books are shallow.
If you can afford to wait hours or days, you can even catch arbitrage opportunities. Triangular arbitrage, to be specific.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:33:51
Regarding "once everything is set up" - even there, Bitcoin is better than legacy online payment systems.

Mining creates value as long as value of bitcoin is above zero. Individual miners are competing for a portion of this value, and that is precisely why you are seeing an increase in hash rate.

There is some confusion here, let me try to clarify:
**Comparing Walmart-to-Walmart service to Bitcoin is like comparing apples to gravity.**
Bitcoin is a decentralized transaction network that enables secure, irreversible, fast, online transfer of XBT-denominated value.
USD is a centralized version of XBT, with lots of other differences irrelevant for this discussion.
The W2W service competes with Dwolla, PayPal, Western Union, MoneyGram, bank wires, and similar services offering transfer of USD.
Bitcoin technology is not specifically designed for remittance of USD. There is nothing in the code about exchange rates or AML. The USD--&gt;XBT--&gt;USD (or other fiat currency) might or might not be a better option, depending on lots of factors which have nothing to do with Bitcoin in itself. I have in fact used this option, as it was at the time by far the best. Extrinsic factors have changed since then, and I am back to mailing certified checks or wiring funds through banks.

The two are absolutely different concepts. With eight decimal places available, the coin cap does not limit the ability to transact in any way. The block size limit, on the other way, defines some serious limits to the way Bitcoin network will be used for transacting. In other words, two or twenty or two hundred million coins makes no difference, as long as it's set in stone. One or ten or hundred MB block size limit, on the other hand, will completely change the use cases of the whole system.

Ideally, you should have sold, and held the USD, part of your mined coins as you mine them, based on your expected tax rate. You can claim your expenses and hardware depreciation related to mining.
Next, if you sold or otherwise spent mined coins later on, there would be capital gains or losses depending on their value when mined and when spent. Since most people prefer to behave as if bitcoin were fungible, it is reasonable to treat them on the "first in, first out" basis.

That's a good analogy, yes. One gallon is being added, and - if nothing else is happening - the level should be rising steadily. The fact is, however, that much, much more is happening - hundreds of gallons are dumped in, drained out, and the level accordingly varies much more than that simple-theoretical effect of the gallon-a-day stream. 
And the fact that the level has been relatively steady (or climbing, or dropping) over the few weeks only means that those large inflows and outflows are balanced (or out of balance one way ot another).
You can conclude absolutely nothing about "new investments" based solely on "the price being steady" and "3,600 new coins are mined each day" - because any effect is drowned in the noise many times larger.

I mean the inflow of *bitcoins* from people's savings is many times more than 3,600 a day.

You don't even know if a coin in "cold storage" still exists, or the keys are lost forever. What you know with reasonable certainty is what's on the order books - asks and bids.

it's (c). 
Miners are likely selling all of their 3,600 coins daily, as in (b) - but "someone must be investing that much" is a big and qurstionable leap of logic.
There is enough capital liquidity in the system to absorb that much for many days and weeks, without any new fiat flowing in. The swings in the price and volumes are much wilder than that presumed effect anyway - so, we'll never know.

The way I understand Ripple is as an IOU network. Your link pertains to the fact that gateways issue asset IOUs, which can then be exchanged in a p2p network, with the ledger of digitally signed transactions, etc.

The supply is increasing by 3,600 a day. The total supply is millions. Some of it goes out of the market books and into cold storage, some of it out of cold storage and into the market. Depending on sentiment, hysteria, FOMO, paranoia, etc. these movements ("some of it") likely overshadow those ~3,600 coins.

Until someone starts regulating mining businesses with regard to what transactions they can and cannot process.
In terms of being able to move money internationally, banking services today are more decentralized and diverse than those few mining pools that control the global bitcoin ledger. And yet, it is not easy finding banks to move your money in violation of trade sanctions or other related bullshit. The only reason Bitcoin today works better in that sense is not related to Bitcoin technology itself, but is simply a consequence of obscurity and related lack of regulation and monitoring of mining businesses. Things will change.
Don't get me wrong - there will always be ways around and associated risks, but Bitcoin in the context of capital controls is intrinsically not very different from fiat.

I am looking for a reason for this time being different, but I am failing to find one - on the contrary, there are serious issues surfacing up, from development politics to block size to stuck transactions.

It is fundamentally the same issue. The apparent distinction is based solely on your arbitrary labeling of certain transactions as "spam" and others as "legitimate". The distinction is further artificially deepened by recommendation for "legitimate" users to guess and pay a higher fee, and by an assumption that "spammers" will not do the same. In reality, we all are legitimate users of the system, and we have our reasons and incentives for using it. Bitcoin doesn't and shouldn't care. It should just work.

How would it be hard to discover? Self-generated transactions would need to be broadcast - otherwise it would be obvious I've never heard them before they were included in a block.

@_date: 2015-07-10 02:10:14
Right, but what should we do if there were no spammers, but legitimate user base grows beyond the current block size limit? Encourage everyone to "pay more", so everyone pays more, so backlog is still there?
Miners can and will prioritize transactions based on fees - that will limit the block size naturally and dynamically in accord with technological progress.

Most credit cards include travel and life insurance coverage when airfare is paid with the card. 
We cannot even make a fair comparison here, as there is no easy way to obtain comparable coverage in exchange for bitcoins. Perhaps hosted wallets will offer this in future (in exchange for the usual consumer tracking, just like credit cards), or airlines themselves for bitcoin payments (in exchange for savings) - but right now there is nothing of sorts, and there is no guarantee it will ever happen.

Think about it. A pool operator can decide not to process your transaction, *but they cannot freeze nor seize your bitcoins*.  Very different from banks in that sense.
In another way, though, you are right: when it comes to theft, I trust Citi Bank securing assets more than I trust an average user today securing their Bitcoin wallet. But that is changing. Just watch.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:30:35
I wrote a long rebuttal only to realize that you are right. Yes, miners can refuse to process particular transactions (c.f. lukejr vs. satoshidice). If those miners control the majority of hashing power, it'd be difficult to spend against those trade sanctions of sorts.
This assumes that miners can decide which unspent outputs to reject - is this practical, with coinjoin and related constructs? In other words - yes, a miner can *freeze assets* when they control the majority of hashing power, but can they freeze *my* assets?

You can send payments from an exchange account (or any other online wallet service) to any address of your choosing - much like you can from your own, local wallet software.

Addresses are derived from the 160-bit hash of the public key. Public key, used by network participants for verifying your signed transactions, is a 256-bit number.
Thus, there are many public keys (and corresponding private keys) that would match any given address.
This is called "hash collision" - a well studied, mostly theoretical concept.
The probability of this happening is astronomically small. The smallness of it is hard to express in words and to grasp intuitively. 
Your question in the end is therefore irrelevant.

You don't need a permission to do banking - just find a bank willing to deal with you. Just ask businesses and governments and individuals from countries under somebody's trade sanctions. 
Bitcoin is not much different, except for it still being unregulated in its novelty. You need a miner to accept and process your transaction. If Bitcoin ever gets significantly "big", this will not be trivial. Mining will be an important and big business, and will be subject to regulatory anf ideological pressures as such.
Now add the open, public, immutable ledger to the mix, and you might be able to see where my comment was coming from. An employer reports the deposit address for your salary. A merchant reports txid. Yes, you can try to evade monitoring and taxes, but that is nothing new - cash transactions, off-shore banks, numbered accounts, Tor, encryption, fake IDs, proxies, whatever.

Not only it was clear to him, but he designed the system based on deep, quantitative understanding of "a lot" in this context.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:33:15
Sounds like a job for quantum cryptographers. They can already exchange keys while knowing if the data has been read en route, right?
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:13:49
Yeah, it's really a *perfect* timing. I just checked with the Bitcoin CEO, this is really happening!
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:32:49
So, this gentleman will just stop interfering, and start creating something of value to this world?
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:32:33
He is talking "the real reason behind BoE interest in blockchain technologies". It doesn't add up.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:10:59
So, it's not different from, say, not a big deal when black people are enslaved in plantations, but it would be a big deal if white people are kept as slaves. Nowadays the same idiotic "my people are special and worthy, unlike the other people" has simply shifted from race to nationality. Still something most people don't choose, but are born into. And still the same "not a big deal because it's not *us*".
@_date: 2016-10-15 13:53:23
This is an argument from the previous century. We should care about the "stability of value" less and less, as our world is becoming more connected and recorded.
Correcting for inflation is already done routinely. In future, we will have access to fine-grained market history that will render the "stability" requirement irrelevant. You can always express historical trade values in current currency terms, if desired.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:13:01
Deeply delusional.
Hint: powerful corporate and/or governmental entities can and do obliterate whole cities and countries, initiate and control "revolutions", fly machines and humans into space, hunt down and execute targeted individuals hiding anywhere, be it in a sewer pipe, a cave, or a downtown condo. Thinking that your pathetic bitcoin wallet is untouchable is the stupidity next only to thinking that they care touching it.

@_date: 2016-10-16 01:10:21


You can have an objective measurement without stability. Just need to recalibrate your charts (much like inflation-corrected charts) based on historical variation of value. Bitcoin then is simply a payment or settlement network. The value can vary all it wants.
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:54:17
why not something in between?
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:48:12
Again, you go ahead and reject transactions with hopes of resubmission with higher fees; I will go ahead and try solving the block with those regular fees while you are waiting full of hope.

Securing your Bitcoin holdings is easier and cheaper than almost any other valuable asset.
Large-scale institutional thefts will likely happen, but I predict most of these to be inside jobs to some extent, and the overall scale will certainly be much less than your "left and right" prediction.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:06:35
Maybe. Maybe it will be Ripple. Maybe it will be Bitcoin, but with "miners" heavily regulated to accept and reject certain transactions. Maybe it will be a truly decentralized, free, network. Maybe there will be a "darknet" as a separate, unregulated tx network.
Whatever happens, Bitcoin is an amazing, powerful technology. It's just that today's Bitcoin lovers might not like at all how this tech will be used in five years.

I almost like the idea of a gag order in that case, assuming something is being done to fix the vulnerabilities (as opposed to using the gag order to buy time while exploiting the vulnerabilities).
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:19:52
A contrarian strategy would also be sensible: grab the fee before other (more greedy and risk-prone) miners get it.
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:42:17
You are absolutely correct. I was digressing into Marxist perspective, which was not the point of your comment.

If it is true that Macau is home to most Bitcoin ATMs per capita, it's a huge revelation for high rollers. Buy bitcoins in your home country, travel to Macau without declaring cash/instruments, exchange for cash, gamble, and then either way travel back again without declaring.
You are still in violation of capital control requirements, but currently face significantly reduced risk of being caught. This will change as Bitcoin goes from obscurity to misunderstanding to mainstream. Even then, there will be interesting legal and philosophical battles - do I need to declare knowledge of brain wallet mnemonics when crossing the border?

One detail that bugs me about VPS - donated or not - is that we end up with the ultimate control over nodes again concentrated in the hands of a few big providers.
So, I'd say - no, I wouldn't. I want to either (1) run a node from home with the simple option to have *bitcoin only* traffic routed through a VPN or Tor or whatever, OR (2) leave it to the pros and use SPV or similar light wallets.

Even better, sell/spend 1/3 (or 1/5, or 1/whatever) of your coins whenever the price doubles or triples, or whatever.
Choose actual numbers based on your views of Bitcoin evolution and risks. You can make it so the net worth still keeps increasing if price increases, but you have hedged the risk of missing out due to price decline.
I've been doing this since 2012, and it's been working great. In an emergency, I'll just sell/spend whatever is needed, but fortunately life has been devoid of such emergencies so far.

You nailed down the crucial part, yes. However, it depends on the asumption that mining is open, global, competitive, and unregulated for the most part. It is today, but that is a political moment, not a hard-coded fact. In fact, even today miners can and do veto transactions - see Eligius, for example, or that mysterious miner of empty blocks.

An interesting comparison is that with credit cards: I can pay to an online merchant, a street vendor in Boston **and** in Paris, a PayPal user, and even Circle.

I thought we were talking about "only within the network" notion. It's not a black-and-white issue. Facebook pay only works within facebook, but the same applies to Bitcoin or anything really - a more useful question is how interoperable or open the network is with respect to other networks.  I have to admit that Ripple is quite intriguing in that sense. Credit cards are surprisingly versatile.  Bitcoin in itself not so much, but services built on top (BitPay, Coinbase) provide an interface to legacy networks. Facebook pay - for now, it's just the US bank accounts. But that's a lot, and in practical sense already covers more than Bitcoin does.

In this thread: delusions colliding with reality. 
Bitcoin is what it is. The block chain is out there for anyone to analyze and correlate with whatever other data they like.
There is no fungibility, except to the rather limited extent defined by the Bitcoin protocol, any CoinJoin-style constructs, and, most importantly, the slowly-disappearing ignorance of businesses and government agencies.

It should be noted that bitcoin transactions leave behind immutable traces, though. Of course there are ways around it, and there are counter-measures, too.

Multiple data points - wallet downloads, reported users of various services, nodes, distribution of unspent ballances, etc. - and some guesstimating and self-reflection all lead me to estimate 100k-200k current owners, maybe 500k-1M of people who ever used it.

Also, don't think that holding and managing your own bitcoins is risk-free for most people. It isn't. Mistakes happen, theft happens.
Finally, either way don't forget the risk of fundamental failure of Bitcoin - mining economics and politics, for example, or bugs in crypto implementations. 
All in all, don't forget to evaluate risks if speculating on the value of bitcoin, and don't foget there are practical uses beyond speculation.

One response would be to "poison the well" - if enough people created noise, the data woukd become much less relevant.
Another response is to not insist on your own privacy - a lost battle anyway, Bitcoin included - but to insist on the same transparency for everyone.

Me investing boils down to me sitting on my ass and "letting my money do the work" - in reality, getting somebody else do the work, and me taking away some of the value they created. Capital. Capitalism.
Now, don't get me wrong - I don't have any strong opinions one way or another. Just really appreciate Marxist view as a rather objective assessment of how capitalism operates, even today. It gets interesting with workers now in principle being able to own equity in means of production.  There are employee-owned companies,  right? There are state-owned companies. How do they compare with privately-owned, trully capitalist endeavors? What are your metrics for that comparison? Interesting stuff.

For years I had to use a screwdriver daily to adjust the azimuth of the read head on my cassette tape storage for C-64. In-person exchanges of tapes. 
DIY modems for BBS.
Assembly. I was able to write simple code for 6502 by directly poking numbers into memory, starting from 49152...
The biggest achievement was the optimized, fast cellular automata engine. I was 15. 
Later on I was using Pine to send and receive emails.
It was all clunky, difficult,  and often pointless except for the thrill of getting to know, hack, and build latest tech. Unlike the OP, I was never sure what aspects ot all that new tech, if any, were really going to change the world. I remember reading about LAN for the first time, and never buying it as something revolutionary. 
My father,  an artist and a graphic designer, was chronically disappointed by matrix and even early laser printers. There was nothing I could say in defense of the technology. It really sucked.
I gradually started falling behind - my coding skills are irrelevant today. When I need it done, student kids get it done, and I cannot even comprehend and appreciate the fine details and subtle abstractions. Sadly, most of them cannot either - it just works out of the box. They use the technology without knowing it.
In hindsight, being an early adopter did not provide much advantage in the long term. Bitcoin may be different for those few who are disciplined and fortunate enough to be able to hodl. I wasn't - today I'm left with ~10% of my early holdings.  Granted, the value has increased much more than 10x. It's all good.

This is an important point. So-called *miners* are payment processors who, in exchange for a fee and the newly-created coins, verify, secure, and seal the transaction data in the public ledger.
If and when Bitcoin grows significantly, regulation of mining is likely in the context of black- or white-listed transactions. Entities under trade sanctions, for example, may have a hard time finding a miner willing to process their transaction. It should be noted, however, that - unlike the legacy banking system - miners *cannot freeze or steal* the money - the worst they could do is reject the transaction.

He talks smoothly and sounds smart to the uninformed, dumb, and lazy. "Bullshitter" is perhaps the most appropriate term. A ten-minute expert. 
He dismissed the *unit of account* aspect without any consideration for the histories of new technologies, bootstrapping problems, etc.
He dismissed the *means of exchange* aspect without any consideration of current reality, and of an enormous potential Bitcoin offers in this arena.
He dismissed the *store of value* aspect, for the sake of dismissing it - there was no real argument there.
Also, the person interviewing him acted like an idiot, nodding at and approving any unfounded, shallow, or questionable statement thrown at him. No signs of life whatsoever.

Few minutes of intro - Bitcoin is a public ledger of digitally signed transactions. Transactions are broadcast through a peer-to-peer network and verified, timestamped, and entered into the ledger by a special kind of peer called a *miner*. Miners are rewarded for securing the system through transaction fees, and also through a predetermined subsidy which is how bitcoins come into existence.
You need to explain digital signatures, hash function, and thus the security and irreversibility of transactions.
**Please** do not torture your audience with blockchain, blocks, and miners: start with the *ledger, pages, and payment processors* respectively - then provide the bitcoin-specific terms.
The main part should be about networking, peer discovery, latency and orphaned blocks, digital signatures and security of balances, hashing and irreversibility of transactions, and ways to associate IP addresses with transactions and identities with btc addresses.

This is interesting.
My first thoughts were that mid-level officials must be buying like mad, hoping that they will hear it through the grapevine if and when a crackdown might come from the top.
But then again, the government can ban it all they want - if I've got my coins, I've got them. It's a matter of time before the first condo goes up for sale in Vancouver for btc, or that vineyard in Poland, or whatever the latest investment fad might be. There would be no panic selling in China by any serious Chinese players. 
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is global, but it operates in what is still a fragmented regulatory environment.

Privacy is not inherent in Bitcoin. It was simply a temporary consequence of Bitcoin's novelty, or was, is, and will be a consequence of additional layers that have nothing to do with Bitcoin directly (Tor, for example).
Today, if you want to move or spend fiat deemed "dirty", you'll need to find a bank or a merchant willing to do it. In future, if you want to move or spend coins deemed "dirty", you'll need to find a miner or a merchant willing to do it.
CoinJoin obviously challenges the power to control currency, and will be treated as such: money laundering.
The issue of privacy is not technological, but political and cultural.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:20:58

Agreed, except I don't see recent actions of Chinese government as an attack *against Bitcoin*. It's not about Bitcoin, it's a general issue of preventing the capital from fleeing abroad. That's how they roll, and they must think they have good reasons for trying to plug the holes - regardless of what you and I thought.
The capital pouring over from China is affecting many markets worldwide, from housing in Vancouver to vineyards in France. It is affecting China, too. The government tries to control it, regardless of the tool involved.

Anoher hard question, typically dismissed, is the role of miners in the future, assuming we continue to grow.
Miners are the middlemen. You cannot transact without a miner accepting and processing your transaction. You might say that anyone anywhere can mine, but that is akin to saying anyone anywhere can start a bank. It's true, but there is much more to it.
Miners may be regulated. Green addresses may become a reality, just like even Swiss numbered accounts require at least some minimum KYC. If things evolve in that direction, Bitcoin will absolutely remain a viable, powerful, and exciting technology for me - but it appears that I am currently a minority. Most bitcoiners are obsessing over some vague, supposed benefits related to "freedom from governments" when in fact these benefits are simply a temporary consequence of regulatory vacuum, not a consequence of properties of the Bitcoin protocol itself.

Bitcoin is many things: an open, p2p, global computer network; a protocol; (unfortunately) a unit of account.
Bitcoin is also any software that enables transactions through said network according to the said protocol, denominated in said units of account.
Your question is specifically about the software. Anyone can write and update and modify it any way they like. There are already several implementations in the wild, with many modifications. As long as your software follows the same protocol as other nodes' software, it will be able to talk to them and to transact in bitcoins.

Therefore, he takes a trivial technical story from a 2010 public forum and turns it into spectacular, fear-mongering bullshit. He publishes it as his own academic paper.

You make some good points, I'll have to reconsider.
Nevertheless, don't you think Bitcoin has vast positive potential even if becoming regulated, including whitelisting? It wouldn't be any worse than the current banking system (and the world hasn't ended), but it would still prevent manipulation of the money supply, and enable fast, global, irreversible, and cheap payments.

Tough decisions. Most obviously, businesses selling coins to affected customers should not be charging their fees on top, i.e. should not profit from the deal. The problem is - how do you know the customer is not lying?
More importantly, affected/infected people should not play along at all. **It is lazy, selfish, short-sighted, and irresponsible towards everyone to pay this kind of ransom.** If nobody was paying, there would be no crime of this kind. Anybody who is paying is an asshole supporting this kind of crime. Learn your lessons, and act responsibly.

Been doing this for years when talking to merchants. They are rightfully scared by the idea of accepting this new, scammy-sounding "tokens". It is much more prudent to ask "would you accept payements through Bitcoin network?" - much like they accept payments through Visa or Amex network. Sits much more comfortably with a typical merchant.

@_date: 2013-10-17 21:08:10
I assume a world where Bitcoin has become big enough that it is regulated. Miners may be forced to refuse certain transactions, or face consequences like Patriot311, or worse. Just like banks today avoid certain transactions.
While anyone in the world can keep hashing with my tx in the pool, the chances of that tx making it into the ledger are proportional to their hashing power. If enough miners are compliant, chances of me sending that money are slim.
This is no different from today's banking system- even regimes under trade sanctions come up with some banking solutions. Lookvup recent Iranian and DPRNK examples.

Good point. Ultimately, he is kicking at the wrong door. I am not saying we should completely disregard security,  but we should find a balance between (1) passively accepting assholes as somethig natural and spending our limited resources building defenses, and (2) dealing with assholes, educating them, punishing them, and locking them away as appropriate.
I think we are putting too much weight on (1) at the expense of (2). Hell, even natural disasters are fought with geoengineering efforts, why do we then passively accept human assholes as something perfectly normal and acceptable that people should just put up with, lock their doors, encrypt everything, remove valuables, trust no one, etc.?

Bitcoin has been around for almost five years now, it is growing strong, and has not been interfered with by any government to any significant level. In fact, many governments have taken quite a friendly stance, and this is reflected in adoption rates (Canada, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland...). Pay your taxes, and do whatever you want, as long as it is legal. Business startups are booming, venture capital is pouring in.
I believe you are genuinely concerned, but I am afraid you are focusing on the wrong spot. Most damage so far has been from scammers, banks, and other private parties, not from the governments.

* It is a digital currency, in fact an accounting system.

* Avoid FUD and wishful thinking alike. Avoid myths.
* Above everything, spend time learning about the technology behind your invenstment. It shouldn't take but a week or two of non-distracted reading on bitcoin.it.

The first gotcha is kicking at the wrong door. People will soon learn the facts you illustrated, and stop jumping to conclusions. Just keep spreading the good word.
On a related note, soon the coinjoin transactions will remind people that in transactions with multiple inputs and outputs it is fundamentally impossible and illogical to "trace" bitcoins in the block chain, as all we do is make sure that inputs and outputs add up.
You cannot tell if the "17" ended up in the "19" or the "28" of the equation
    17 + 30 = 19 + 28.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:23:02
That will probably take care of itself, as long as transacting in bitcoins remains easy and cheap (frictionless, to use a fancy term). The rich will want to use those coins for something, after all. This force will be countered by the greed of the greedy, trying to accumulate the coins, so we will reach some steady state.
I am more concerned with the long-term economics of mining, and how it might lead to centralization. We might end up with miners being the new banks, as we cannot transact without them.

I believe this will be addressed by the upcoming [payment protocol]( based on old-school certificates and signatures. You would be reasonably sure the address was really provided by whoever claims to be providing it to you, but it can still be a one-time address.
So, no need for CoinValidation by the third party, only for the third-party certification authority. Same crappy situation, but people are used to it already, and won't run around screaming hysterically like they do about CV.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:01:52
The one sending the payment broadcasts it, not the one receiving it.
Once broadcast, it propagates through the p2p network of nodes. Some of the nodes are also miners. One of them will include it in the future block.
The merchant of course can and should have a way to see unconfirmed and confirmed transactions, either by running a node or by relying on a third party.

In reality, you don't send bitcoins to a wallet. You announce through a public, peer-to-peer network that you are sending coins to some other address. This is recorded in the public ledger, a.k.a. the block chain. The receiving wallet doesn't have to be on. It doesn't even have to exist - you sent coins to a black hole in that case, they are lost. 
Now, if you want to send those coins further from that second wallet, you will need it to be on and connected, and up-to-date, so that it can see the transaction it received, and send coins further.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:17:29
Just a small but important correction: 
You have not lost 50%. If you sell now, you will lose 50%. Only entry and exit points matter. Everything else is a useless whatif fantasy.
Having said that, if you don't sell now, but sell in the next few months, you are likely to lose more than 50%. We know this, because goldman-sachs said so the other day.
Then again, if I didn't have anything better to do with my money, I'd be buying gold now, and patiently waiting for the next uptrend. Fortunately, I do have better things to do with my extra income. You see where this is going, right? I wasn't sure when I started writing.

Yes. I didn't mean to dismiss the control of emission as something insignificant. It does have huge consequences.
The reaction of the State then is to attempt to track and control bitcoin-denominated transactions much like they do with any other transaction tool. Where you and I apparently disagree is to what extent bitcoin in itself enables or disables this control.
Sure, you can use bitcoin under the radar, just like you can do with cash or barter. The new thing about bitcoin is that you can now do it online, globally. Much harder to do if you are a big business, but it is possible. Drug cartels do it all the time. Even then, the public ledger makes it tricky. All it takes is one honeypot or undercover transaction, and suddenly you are on the radar.

First of all, test your system (wiring funds, mainly) with a couple of hundreds of dollars. 
Next, consider your status in Korea - I assume you've got some kind of work permit. You are planning to claim an exemption in the US because you work abroad, but then again you are perhaps only authorized for a particular job in Korea. So, your profits may not be subject to the U.S. exemption. 
Overall, talk to fellow expats about Korean taxes and visas, talk to an accountant from Korea and from the U.S., perhaps talk to an immigration lawyer in Korea. 
By the way, what you are trying to do is called triangular arbitrage. Nothing wrong and nothing illegal with it per se, but you need to consider your work permits and tax implications beforehand. People often see arbitrage opportunities and get all excited, but fail to include the administrative overhead.

It is simple and obvious: the calculations take previous page of the ledger, the new transactions that are to be included in the next, yet-to-be-created page in the ledger, a timestamp, and the miner's receiving address (for the block reward and the fees). The calculations than produce the next page in the ledger, with said new transactions included in a mathematically tamper-proof way.
In other words, the purpose of the calculations is to validate and then timestamp and secure transactions in the public ledger. 
Good enough?

Just to be clear: it is currently hard to find a merchant selling a particular product directly for bitcoins. This is no surprise. How many companies were answering emails in 1988?
Spending bitcoin, however, *is much simpler than using any currently major online payment system*. This is a fact. Just honestly list everything that was needed for you to obtain that credit card, and to use it to pay for something online. Credit history, small print, waiting for weeks, callingto activate the card, providing your billing address and telephone number, sometime having to call to authorize the transaction, then remembering to pay the bill next month, and of course worrying if card number was captured by a thief anywhere along the path. Bitcoin is superior in this sense. You send money to an address. Done. Provable.

It's a perfect advice if you read it. 
When using a new kind of wallet or new kind of transaction, only send a small amount in, then practice and make sure you understand what you are doing and why. In this case, there wouldn't have been 20 fucking coins available to lose.

This is highly unlikely, as it would be irrational. Most miners understand there is money to be made in mining - it's just about being stubborn and not dropping out when others do. Serious mining businesses are prepared to mine at a loss occasionally, and take advantage of others dropping out by expanding their own share of the cake.
 &gt;Blockchain grows so large it forces all small players out, leaving blockchain maintenance in the hands of a few big players
Again, highly unlikely. The blockchain grows linearly in time, perhaps with an occasional jump if and when we increase the block size limit. It will always be X kilobytes or megabytes per 10 minutes. On the other hand the cost of data storage and processing power has been dropping exponentially for the past 50 years.
The big concern for me is that of a mass disappointment when masses who misunderstood how bitcoin works realize that miners are really payment processors, and that miners may become *regulated* payment processors, and that the whole "bitcoin lets me transact without interference from the government" bullshit is not based in reality. There **is** the middle man: the miner. This is sad, as Bitcoin technology enables amazing things never possible before - but misled folks are too busy with their obsession with falsehoods, and fail to notice these amazing possibilties. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:27:49
That sounds nice in theory. 
In reality, you can go to a shopping mall and ask shoppers why they spent their dollars and euros. Almost none of them will say "why, because I know my money will be worth less tomorrow, so I better spend it today!"
People seldom take inflation/deflation into account, and even when they do there are other, heavier factors to consider - the needs, the wants, changes in personal income, etc. The exception are extreme cases, but even then in reality the world doesn't end. Here we are - the bitcoin has gone through at least three extreme phases of growth (price deflation, as you refer to it), and the economy did not collapse, people were still using it to transact.

It is misfortunate and misleading that the term "mining" has stuck. 
Mining **is** useful. Miners, perhaps *payment processors* is a better term, verify newly broadcast transactions, bundle them together, time stamp them, and seal the bundle as a new page in the public ledger. Their calculations ensure the veracity, permanence, security, and availability of the record of all transactions in Bitcoin economy. Their calculations *enable* the economy.
It's not *just* a random puzzle they are solving for a reward - it involves hashing the digest of the previous page, digest of all the transactions going into the new page, and the timestamp. It is a carefully designed process that makes Bitcoin transactions possible.
@_date: 2013-10-16 07:05:32
Tell a random grandma that miners "solve **complex math problems** to get rewarded in Bitcoin," and she will likely imagine a situation vastly different from reality. The reality is that miners compete to validate, timestamp, and seal bitcoin transactions by entering them into a public ledger. There are no "complex math problems", there is trivial shuffling of numbers according to a verifiable, pre-agreed upon recipe, that takes time and luck. It's a lottery, not complex math problems, and the work expanded to win the ticket is the work that ensures the security and veracity of the public ledger.

It's a good question, but I'd rather work to help make it irrelevant, than try to answer it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:50:32
I mean that we should get the priorities straight. There is no country in the world where Bitcoin is illegal, and in fact many governments have taken quite a friendly stance (Sweden, Germany, Finland, Canada). Why wouldn't they, with the public ledger and everyting?  Bitcoin economy in the U.S. is also growing, companies starting, more and more merchants accepting it. Bitcoin is money.
At the same time, we face challanges pertaining to lack of, or inadequacy, of merchant solutions, unclear tax implications of mining income, transaction tools too confusing for the average Joe, and above everything armies of scammers and thieves hurting the newcomers and damaging the public image of Bitcoin.
Rather than spend time and energy on the imagined problem of "government crackdown", we should focus on real, practical problems that prevent Bitcoin from growing even faster, and growing sustainably.

Actually, no. Some of us make certain transactions anonymous by using tools which have nothing to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin in itself is not anonymous. It is not anonymous by design.

First of all, I urge you and everyone else to dedicate a few minutes imagining you never had a bank account, and never used an ATM nor checks. You don't know shit. You decide to open an account. Go ahead. Where to go? What are the options? How to choose one? What the hell is PIN? ATM? How long for transactions to clear? Oh, but it's different with checks? My card got skimmedwhat?! What is this overdraft protction? Etc.
Bitcoin shines with simplicity in comparison. Just think about the comparison with banking above, and devote reasonable time to learning. Few weeks should suffice. 
Virtex is a registered corporation, the owner is known by name, and they have been around for several years. Giving them your personal information is no different than giving it to a bank or Costco or Rogers.
If you choose localbitcoins, you will be able to find a seller, meet, give them cash, and they release their coins into your localbitcoins wallet. From there, it's up to you where and how you are going to store your coins.

First of all, the example above is not money laundering. It is simply a mixing service. To launder coins, you would need to be able to make them look like they come from a legitimate business. A mixing service simply obfuscates the trail of money, making it hard to track  or to  prove beyond reasonable doubt blah blah.
Now, you could run a USD mixing service just as cheaply had it not been for government intervention.  Why, just invite interested parties to send you their cash, checks, or wires, deposit it all into your bank account, then start paying them back. It's trivial, except in reality you would soon feel the heat, and the risk of heat raises the cost of the operation. By the way, this is again a good place to note that mixing services are utterly ineffective as a laundering tool - you sent coins somewhere, you got the coins back. That does not convince the judge that your income was in fact legal to begin with, when prosecutor is showing evidence that it was illegal to begin with. That mixing service does not refute the prosecutor's evidence whatsoever.
Bitcoin mixing services,  intentional and unintentional, have not felt the heat  yet simply because the governments are still mostly ignorant of this new technology.

I get that, and it is totally fine if you understand what you are doing. However, most clients you are trying to get interested will not know what they are doing, and might end up realizing too late that any random person might suddenly know how wealthy they are.
I donated some beer money to a person hosting a party once, to the address he provided from his phone. I looked it up. That's all he was using. His savings are now worth *over a million dollars* (and that's the minimum, right?). That is not a healthy situation. Things can get ugly.

I am thankful for Satoshi's initial ideas, hard work, and selfless sharing. I am glad their coins are now worth a lot. However, it's been five years. Lots of other people's hard work and creativity has been built into Bitcoin ecosystem by now, and has gotten us to where we are now. Bugs have been fixed, new features added, new ideas implemented.

Log scale is there simply because data spans several orders of magnitude. Doubling or halving (for example) of the price is then represented by the same length on your screen, regardless of price. Linear scale distorts the representation of the relative changes in price, log scale does not. That is all.

Why all the crying? If bitcoins were fungible, this company wouldn't be able to suddenly render them non-fungible without changing the protocol. They obviously do not change the protocol - they simply rely on the protocol as-is.
Now, the majority of current users *would prefer* bitcoins to be fungible, and get mad when anyone demonstrates that in reality it is not *quite* so. 
Now, the good news:  Bitcoin technology is revolutionary, and it enables things never possible before. Fungibility has nothing to do with it. The flow of dollars and euros between bank accounts can and is tracked when powerful-enough entities desire so. My spending habits are tracked and shared by private entities I rely on to perform transactions, mostly for marketing and insurance purposes. And yet, dollars and euros are useful, the world hasn't ended, and I am alive and well. Why is everyone freaking out about somebody looking at the Bitcoin public ledger then? 
If you desire privacy or anonymity, get it. Just like you can get it with dollars or euros or dinars, you can get it with bitcoins - the tools you'd use have nothing to do with Bitcoin. There are VPNs, Tor, stolen identities, offshore services, whatnot. It belongs more to than to here.

You could still go the Samurai way:
Learn to export the private key from the bitcoin-qt client using dumpprivkey command, and to import it into a light client (multibit or electrum or android mycelium) or blockchain.info wallet. That way you don't need to wait for the sync to complete, just forget about bitcoin-qt if it isn't for you.
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:02:32
Thanks, this is an excellent argument. It also means that, for practical purposes, the fungibility of bitcoins depends on actors' behavior - it is not intrinsic to Bitcoin.
For example, the numbers in the equation 
    5 + 8 = 6 + 7
are fungible: no matter how much you force me to, I cannot tell if the "5" ended up in "6" or "7".
So, the whole idea of bitcoins being fungible and consequently untraceable is not based in a fundamental property of Bitcoin - it is simply a social construct.
We could make an analogy with gold: while we perform transactions as if gold were fungible, in reality we could run isotopic or other forensic analysis to try and trace particular batches, thus rendering gold non-fungible.

Except, there is no need for a new fork. The current one is perfectly easy to control. From the practical point of view, there is no difference between bank or credit accounts and bitcoin addresses. 
You receive a salary - to a bank account, or to a receiving address. It is tied to your identity either way.
You order a plane ticket - the tx inputs are tied to your identity.
You use an online wallet - it may or may not be complying with this or that government, just like the banks (domestic vs. off-shore/Swiss/whatever).
You send coins to a mixing service, just like you can mix dollars to obfuscate the trail, and are prepared to deal with flags being raisen. 
You exchange goods for cash, or for Bitcoins, and nobody cares or can bother caring. Unless you are already a person of interest.  Again, no practical difference between the USD and the XBT.
You try to send a USD payment to a certain company in Iran, turns out you cannot, or worse. You cannot find a bank to process the transaction, or you do find it and then find out it was a honeypot.

In reality, if you honestly look at the data, most of the time none of this matters, and when it does it is likely a convenient coincidence. What matters is, first of all, chaos. What matters next to a lesser degree are things not made public, because if they were made public they would quit working: pump-and-dump schemes and associated news campaigns, insider trading, and such.

...and if the transaction is not accepted and processed by a miner, it's as if it never happened. This is not a semantic issue, but a practical one. It is more appropriate to say that *requests* for transactions are spread through the p2p network - it takes a miner to make it official, and today it is only several major pool operators.
I know that some developers are considering new ways of pooled mining, where block contents are not in the hands of the pool operator, but each individual worker. Similarly, there is the p2p pool. These, if and when they become dominant forms of mining will render my FTFY wrong. I look forward to that day.

Yep. My comment above was too inflamatory, but it boils down to what you and are saying.
Yes, the blockchain enables people to keep a copy and agree on the contents of one central ledger of digitally signed transactions. It's potentially a game changer in many ways. However, it is far from being a great tool for freeing people from the oppresive-and-taxing-hand-of-the-evil-government-and-abusive-middlemen-banksters.
The government can just keep doing what they have been doing: if you are a business involved with bitcoin, you have to play by the same rules as when you deal with any other sort of money. Data retention, sales receipts, KYC, AML, perhaps some consumer protection. It's trivial.
If you are the middlemen banker preventing people from transacting freely between themselves, well, you just ask yourself *what is the actual purpose of bitcoin miners?* Oh, they validate transactions between people? And they can choose whether to accept or deny a transaction involving this or that address? Uhm, sounds oddly familiar, with the only caveat that you need to associate the address with a person, just like you gracefully do even with the Swiss numbered accounts. And you have friends in government to help you achieve this.

I've been using Bitcoin one way or another since late 2010. I mined, lost, spent, earned, traded, cashed out, bought, donated - and I never really hoarded them. I used them to convert and send fiat internationally when prices were right. Most importantly, I learned a lot about accounting, taxes, media, my own and others' psychology, computers, networking, and heat transfer.
Bitcoin is one of the most rewarding interests I've ever found.
I understand that many of you are here because you were hoping to magically get rich quick. It might have worked out for some of you, and it has certainly been a disappointment for many. It's a misunderstanding. If you are trying to get rich quick by sitting on your ass, you are gambling at best, and being a victim more likely.
If you still want to be involved simply to get wealthy - at least understand your investment, and **nurture it**. Help with the development, learn, report bugs, offer to sell or buy stuff for coins, help a merchant start understanding and accepting bitcoin, educate people, do not bullshit, and learn to see things from the future point of view. **It is hard work**.
Also, look back at the past few years in weekly averages, in the log scale.

I don't think Bitcoin can help us to sidestep things that bother you the most, that's all. It's a great invention, potentially a game changer, and already lets us do things not possible before. But the change you are seeking is in the domain of politics and culture, not the technology. In fact, you might get a bad surprise one day realizing that those who bother you started using Bitcoin to their advantage and to your dismay.

Bitcoin lets you do many wonderful things not possible before, but "transacting without banks or governments interfering" is not one of them.
Today, you need to rely on a private third-party such as a bank or a payment processor to transact quickly across the distance. These third parties are regulated by the governments.
Today, you need to rely on private third parties to send bitcoins. They are called miners. Tomorrow, they will be regulated by the governments.

In reality, this is insignificant in the context of government control. You buy a house, and have to jump through all the hoops to have it connected to the city infrastructure, pay property taxes, etc. You buy a pencil in a store, sales tax is included. Whether you paid for it in bitcoin or gold or dollars is irrelevant. You order internationally and pay with cc or bitcoin, you pay import duties based on the actual value of the item as determined by the customs official.

Depends on your spending habits and trading patterns.
The more often you retreive your keys, the more you subject them to thermal stress, which eventually leads to fracture.
The colder the storage, the larger the stress during each retrieval, which again eventually leads to fracture.
Elliptic curves were not really designed for thermal cycling. The best thing to do would be to *read the keys while still cold* - I've seen a major BTC holder's freezer with wiring running straight through the sidewall.

It is useful in these discussions to think deeper about fungibility/traceability. 
No asset is perfectly fungible in itself. Fungibility is simply a social construct, an agreement. You brought up gold. **Gold is not fungible** in and of itself. Gold fingerprinting - analysis of the patterns of trace impurities - enables identification and tracking of gold. Each batch exhibits a unique fingerprint based on its origin and processing history. Add to this surface features, and you end up with every piece of gold being traceable, even within a batch. Furhtermore, the whole issue of *good delivery* shows that it is not true that you could simply exchange any physical unit for another one. You can't. Still, gold is being used as store of value, and is being traded. It hasn't disappeared.
Banknotes have serial numbers. New ones are starting to have magnetic ink, and now even printed nonvolatile memory, enabling even faster automatic tracking of serial numbers.
Bitcoin is fungible only because we agree not to look back into the block chain and into merchant and exchange transaction data. The moment somebody starts looking - and this moment is already in the past - the fungibility is no longer there.

None taken. When paying in coffee shop, I can swipe my credit card, push the YES button, enter the PIN, then later worry about making the monthly payment. When paying with cash, I need to choose the bils and coins manually, and worry about storing the change. When paying with bitcoins, I scan the qr code, and payment is finished. I use mycelium wallet, btw.
When paying for an online service, cash is clearly not an option. With credit card I need to enter my card number - the precious, only number for that card, provide my name, address, telephone - completely unnecessary and risky, and worry about the bank, my family, and everyone in between seeing the statement.
With bitcoins, it takes literally 10 seconds to copy/paste the receiving address, perhaps type in PIN or password.
Cash is a clear loser in both scenarios. Cards and Bitcoin each have pros and cons, but bitcoins are definitely faster and simpler to use once you are set up. If you honestly imagine setting up and learning from scratch, Bitcoin again beats opening bank accounts, filling out paperwork, obtaining credit history, applying for credit cards, learning about APR calculations, dirty tricks, etc.

It is a common misconception that mining involves useless, complex calculations.
The calculations are relatively simple, predetermined shuffling of transaction data and timestamps to produce a digest which makes the ledger tamper-proof, thus securing the whole system and making Bitcoin possible.

I fold them with a piece of alu foil hugging the private key, then take them for lamination.

The lamination of course protects from water damage, and is significantly tamper-evident.

Wallet software (a.k.a. a client) enables you to generate, keep, and manage public/private keypairs on your computer. 
The private key, meant to be kept private, is the code that enables spending of coins associated with the keypair.
The public key is used to derive bitcoin address, which enables anyone, including yourself, to associate coins with that particular key pair, that is to send you the coins.
All the transactions - sending of coins - is kept track of in a public ledger we call the block chain. Wallet software monitors the block chain so it can always keep your total balance up to date based on the keypairs you control.
There is currently absolutely no reason and no justification to use third-party services that keep your private keys for you (inputs.io being the latest example). Perhaps some day these will be regulated, insured, and otherwise made more secure than your PC - until that day, keep your keys on your PC or simply on a piece of paper.
If your PC is on all the time, use the reference client Bitcoin-qt. This way you also help the network. Otherwise, use MultiBit or Electrum or blockchain.info, or create paper wallets on bitaddress.org. On android devices, try Bitcoin Wallet or Mycelium Wallet. Whatever you use, make sure you back up your wallet, and keep the copy in a separate location. All client software lets you encrypt your wallet (or at least protect it with a PIN), and you should do this.
Keep your wallet device secure and clean from infection.
Practice with small amounts first. Send, receive, redeem a paper wallet. 
Finally, don't be discouraged if it seems complex. If you think about it honestly, the banking system you use is ways more complex for a total newcomer. It'll take a week or two to become sufficiently proficient in Bitcoin.

Right, which brings us to the question of speed. How fast is too fast in case of Bitcoin? 
The mining infrastructure is in place, and can grow smoothly. 
Node software and light clients are available for downloads globally. 
Exchanges are dealing with this latest bubble with significantly less stretch marks and growing pains.
Newcomers now have historical data available to easily see and learn and put current fluctuations in the context - thus, the instances of mass panic are less likely.
So, how fast is too fast? Why wouldn't it be sustainable to keep doubling the price every few weeks, until an equilibria are reached?

I wouldn't say I'm worried, but it is not something to be dismissed easily. 
Right now, it would be extremely difficult to commit a serious, violent crime in any functioning country and get away with the bitcoin loot that you then spend.
If and when CoinJoin and similar schemes are implemented, it would still leave lots of room for forensics. Honeypot CoinJoin sessions, network traffic analysis, and of course all the millions of details unrelated to Bitcoin in any complex game like kidnapping.
Here is an excercise for you: think hard, and describe a step-by-step plan of kidnapping-for-bitcoin. Start with identifying and choosing the victim, kidnapping, communicating and negotiating, important what-if scenarios, receiving the payment, and spending it.
If you honestly look at the plan, or even better ask someone else to look at it, you'll realize it is full of forgotten details, traces left behind, and room for disater.
So no, I'm not terribly worried.

You can calculate the cost and the average time to clear the transaction in that case, you know...
You can also put cash in a suitcase, file the paperwork, board a plane, and deliver the cash into hands of the other user. Peer-to-peer, and faster and cheaper than your proposal.

As others have already hinted, you are doing it backwards. Do not generate the passphrase using your brain, that is a terrible source of entropy. Generate a random number properly, then encode it as a mnemonic if you wish to store it in your brain. 
Either way, be prepared to have your coins lost by forgetting your mnemonic for any of a number of reasons. Mad cows, stroke, trauma, stress, heart failure, the bus factor, ageing, whatever.

A transaction input needs to refer to an output of a previous transaction, but this is the generation (block reward) we are talking here. There are normally no previous previous transactions, in this or any other case of mined coins.
It appears that Satoshi prevented spending of the Genesis Block reward on purpose: this was not mined by free, competing miners, but had to be hard-coded by himself *before* Bitcoin network is launched. Thus, it would be unethical to claim those coins.

Ouch!  I was asking seriously.
Can Americans among us please stand up and explain what usually happens after these hearings?  Do they digest all the comments, then prepare a bill to be passed if they deem it needed? What about the Congress?  What was this all about?
I mean, **we** are going to the Moon, and there was so much noise being made about these senate hearings, so I thought it was somehow relevant, but now you are telling me **they** simply wanted to know about that face in the Moon, or a rabbit, or whatever, and one of them even moonwalked into the hearing unprepared, and then they talked about terrorists being able to see in the moonlight, and that's it???  No talk of rockets, orbits, fundraising, arresting the engineers, giving German rocket scientists green cards, nothing???

How would they benefit from Bitcoin? Their receiving address would be watched, and exchanges (and in future miners and merchants) will be pressured to block it or report it, just like the banks with fiat. You might find a bank willing to deal with ransom fiat, you might find an exchange (and in the future, a miner or a merchant) willing to deal with ransom coins.

This is a good place to reming everyone to **practice with small amounts first** whenever they are trying out a new kind of wallet or transaction type.
Even if *everything Bitcoin* is new to you, the advice still applies: start with a small amount.
Move the coins. Spend them. Receive them. Back up your wallet. Erase the wallet. Recover it from the backup. Redeem your paper or whatever wallet. Redeem *part* of your paper wallet. Understand what you are doing. Move to another kind of wallet. Repeat. Keep coins on your PC. Are they still there, or are they stolen?
Congratulations! You are now ready to consider investing or using a bigger amount (that, of course, you can afford to lose).

The more I think about this, the less sense I can make of either approach. It doesn't matter what the total number of coins is - that just defines upper boundaries we will never reach anyway. 
What matters is the market, and that is completely fluid and hard to predict with any certainty (other than your own actions if you are a big player). Even if **all** coins become available on the markets, we still have no clue what order books will look like.
What also matters is the velocity of money - how much bitcoins change hands.

It is argued in the article that more confidence is needed, based on (1) history, and (2) less volatility.
Bitcoin has been around for almost five years now, and finding a weakness in the protocol is now worth many tens of millions *at least*. Still, it remains rock-solid. How much history  is enough?
As for volatility, it is not a logical argumet that merchants worry about their today's revenue being cut by 50% in value tomorrow: it might as well go up by tens of percent, and in fact this is more likely than losing the value,  given  the fundamentals and the enormous potential for innovative technologies built on top of bitcoin protocol.

I agree, but one little detail that we should note is that you do need cooperation of an intermediary - a miner. In theory, they could be required or inclined not to include certain transactions.

Sure, you can try to mine blocks yourself and include whichever transactions you like in these blocks.
The tricky part is that there are other miners, so you will be competing with them.

Next, some of the bought coins cannot be accounted for. I know I spent them on donations, coffee, shirts, muffins -but I have no record of those transactions. Strictly speaking, I should be paying taxes on the difference between the price I bought coins at and the value of goods I exchanged them for.

Generally, I don't care for anonymity. It's not about someone reading my emails or tracking my habits, and knowing exactly who I am; it's about someone having an exclusive access to everyone's correspondence and habits. It's not fair, it's not symmetrical, it's prone to abuse and it provides an unfair advantage to the few unelected entities.
In other words, I am all for openness, as long as it is mutual. I would love, for example to know names and identities of all NATO pilots who drop bombs on foreign countries. I would love to be able to track financial transactions of the MasterCard CEO, or the National Endowment for Democracy. I mean, why would they want to remain anonymous to the public?

This is how Bitcoin works by design. The reference ("official") client will manage a bunch of addresses without you even noticing it (learn about "change address"). 
I wish I could tell you not to worry about it, but there are several simple clients out there that re-use one or few addresses. Yes, you should be careful about this. Keep your savings separate from your pocket money.
Finally, do not get discouraged by the apparent complexity of Bitcoin. Just try to remember all the things you had to learn about credit cards, credit scores, stolen identities, bounced checks, skimming, charge-backs, account verifications, and [banks studying your spending habits](
Bitcoin is still simple in comparison. Keep asking questions, learning, and using it wisely when it works for you!

It could work. Sadly, most bitcoiners nowadays confuse their wishful thinking with reality - they think that Bitcoin *inherently* frees you from the government or oppression or taxes or whatever. In reality, there's none of that in the code. Things that bother them are in the political, not the technological domain, and they are confusing current regulatory vacuum with properties of Bitcoin.
Just wait until revenue agencies realize how great of a technology Bitcoin is.

There are a few good points, and a few shaky ones. Bitcoin indeed is amenable to network analysis, and powerful entities that can harvest significant amounts of data will be able to keep tabs on who is spending where and when. That has been the case with electronic fiat for the past 20 years, and yet the world hasn't ended. It ended shitty in certain ways, sure, but here we are anyway.

Finding an active address... 
You'd need to 
1. Generate private key, randomly but without repetitions (repetitions are unlikely anyway)
2. Calculate public key using ECDSA algorithm
3. Calculate address as ripemd160(sha256(pubkey))
4. Now, for the hard part - search the up-to-date blockchain to determine unspent inputs to that address. This takes time. I Imported private key the other day, and it took my PC 12 minutes to rescan the block chain.

It's best to consult with the tax authority in your jurisdiction. In Canada, CRA has issued broad guidelines. Ditto for several European countries, and now for China (ouch!). Not sure what goes on with the IRS and various States in the U.S.
What said sounds reasonable. It shouldn't be an issue at all. Also consider implications of holding earned coins, then selling them later on - there are likely capital gains (or losses) or income there. Either way, save yourself from panic accounting by keeping your books in order throughout the year, and planning ahead.

Right, that was my point. This service is just a good, old money laundering service - you might as well find an off-shore or even a domestic bank that will do the same with dollars. Call it banking with strong customer privacy. Nothing to do with Bitcoin technology at the fundamental level. Just like Tor, etc.
These kinds of services, of course, may or may not reveal money flow patterns to the investigators. They may be honeypots. They may be scams. They are anonymous themselves, go figure.
The only bitcoin-specific service of this kind will be coinjoin, and it brings up interesting legal questions.

What's this to do with bitcoin? They can keep dollars, gold, or bitcoin with a third-party bank-like business and have these assets seized if business plays by the rules.
They can keeps dollars, gold, or bitcoins at home or off-shore, and Uncle Sam can still try and get them, although with more effort.
Either way, it's not a bitcoin topic.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:22:04
You would have simply created a new, unique, trackable fingerprint from that point on. The whole effort is huge and yet utterly useless for money laundering or tax evasion purposes.
You sell drugs for bitcoin and you then buy a house with bitcoin. Investigators ask you how you earned the bitcoin, and how taxes were paid. You tell them, or you tell to a judge later - well, see, the bitcoin came from this CoinJoin transaction, or from that mixing service. I put 100 coins in, I got 99 coins out after the fee. Useless. Not to mention the very fact of using any form of mixing service drawing attention to you. 
You can in fact do the same with bank accounts, and it is equally useless: you use a mixing service. In that case, it is called "offshore bank with bank privacy".
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:06:47

@_date: 2013-11-24 07:58:00
First explain what you mean by 'work out the key'. What computational steps are involved?
Let me help you get started:
To get from the known address to public key, you need to figure out a public key such that ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)) produces that known adress. 
Next you take your unlikely candidate and then have to figure out the private key that produces that candidate with the EC algorithm.
Saying 'good luck' would be terribly misguided.

It's a long list. See [here for consumers]( and [here for merchants]( 


Exchange fees vary currently between 0.4% and 1.5%. If merchant accepts bitcoins directly, it's only a matter of bitcoin transaction fee. If they convert back to fiat, the above exchange fees apply. Also see bitpay.com - charities, for example, pay no conversion fee with them.


You keep your phone wallet safe in the same manner you keep your wallet safe. If you run out of money on either of them, you ran out of money. Use a credit card. It can be denominated in bitcoins one day - why not? Have a friend send you some in 10 minutes, instead of wiring it or westernunionizing it over a few days.


I use bitcoins locally in a coffee shop. It really is easy. They ring the price, a QR code pops up, I aim my phone, clik "send" and they see the transaction come in. Done. I get a sales receipt. I don't worry about credit card due dates, I don't worry about cash change (which is really a PITA if you think about it). This particular merchant decided to keep the coins, they don't even convert them back to fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:16:20
About spending directly - yes, sales tax included (or not) as usual, but how about capital gains or losses based on the coin value at the time of acquisition and the time of spending them?
IfI bought one XBT at $1, then used 0.03 to pay for coffee + sales tax a year later when value is $100, do I owe tax on the appreciation of these 0.03 coins?

Of course you can tax transactions with digital currency, just like you tax transactions with cash, or barter. Every time I pay with cash or bitcoin in a coffee shop, I get the sales receipt, taxes included.
You are saying that people can decide to try to evade taxes. They can do so with bitcoin, cash, or even bank transactions (sic!).

I have manually typed tens of private keys into my desktop client, and I never had to retype due to an error.

And then I just wanted to pay for online subscription to a magazine, but had to provide credit card number, name, address, telephone number - and then the magazine customer's database got hacked, and my info stolen, and card cancelled by the bank again.

To trust such service, I would need:
1. Verifiable corporate and personal identities behind the company
2. Clear ToS
3. Self-insurance in the form of one cold-storage address assigned for each customer. The company would deposit matching funds into this address for each deposit a customer makes. These are the insurance funds. On withdrawals, the company claims back the matching funds. A statement describing the role of these funds is signed by the company using the corresponding private key.

I like the idea, and I generally like it when people build stuff - which is what you did. Kudos. 
The reason for my questions is that you are releasing a tool where users input sensitive information, private API keys. Bitcoin is becoming serious, with all the good and bad consequences. 
If there is no source to review and build from, the user needs to trust you. This is typically supported by a formal, legally binding agreement between you and the end user. This sounds dry and scary, but that's the reality if you are releasing it into the big, open world, instead of just sharing it with friends. If nothing else, you need to protect yourself from liability in case of bugs or unintended data leaks.
I would either make the source code available, with a license of your choosing (creative commons, MIT...), or release the binaries with a boilerplate EULA.

Mining difficulty self-adjusts so the rate of creation of new coins remains constant regardless of the resources being thrown in, or withdrawn out of, mining. This adjustment takes place every 2016 blocks, or approximately two weeks.
There is a small positive or negative variation due to blocks being found faster or slower prior to adjustment when mining power is consistently increasing or decreasing, respectively, but the effect is negligible.
For all practical purposes, Bitcoin has a predetermined inflation rate which halves every few years, thus reaching zero in the distant future.

The guilt is, ultimately, with the thief. We should not forget that, and we should support investigation and prosecution.
Next layer of guilt is with BIPS.
Last, but not least, merchants are guilty. They are guilty because they sign up with, and thus support, payment processors who do not explicitly make themselves liable for any and all losses incurred in hacks of their infrastructure. In other words, bitcoin users should only maintain  relationships with businesses who are self insured, or otherwise insured against thefts of users' funds.

Thinking about properties of Bitcoin, if Bitcoin **is** fungible, the fungibility cannot be destroyed without changing the protocol, and turning Bitcoin into something new and different.

Can you provide convincing data? I looked into it a while back, and it didn't seem to be the case.
It is impossible to honestly pick and choose media outlets to include and exclude, so the best we can do is assume that people read about Bitcoin in the news, then search for it on Google. Ergo, news exposure should translate into surges in the search volume. If news stories indeed fuel bubbles, it would have to be with a lag of few weeks needed to learn, open accounts, transfer fiat, and start buying.  Now, if you correlate (and cross-correlate) the search volume with the price, you'll see that generally this is not what happens. In fact, the surges in price tend to create news stories, not the other way around.

If you have a problem with the size of blockchain, or with the bandwidth, do not use the full client. There are several light(er) clients to choose from.
It should also be noted that this problem **is not likely to get worse**: the maximum size of the block is fixed, and blocks created at a constant rate (give or take). Thus, the size of block chain can ultimately only grow linearly with time. On the other hand, the storage space you can buy for a dollar has been growing exponentially with time for the past 50 years.

It's up to you, or more precisely up to the software you are using. 
The reference client, and most other multi-key clients, will typically create a new change address for every transaction. As pointed above, it's still your bitcoin. The client groups your available balances (addresses) based on many factors to decide which ones to spend from. 
Some mobile wallets can operate using a single address- each transaction then sends the funds to the receiving address, and the change (if there is any) back to the same address. This makes it simple and convenient, but then anyone you ever sent money to can keep seeing your further spending habits and earnings by watching your single address.

That's a perfectly good question. Because in some cases it is faster, more secure, or easier. I already have my btc spending funds. Now, to purchase a subscription to an online service, I can either fill out my credit card number, billing address and phone, perhaps Visa online password, all while having to enable third-party cookies, and then have the bank and my family know what I purchased. With bitcoin, I just copy and paste the address.
Another reason - and this is not hypothetical - is that Bitcoin is likely to grow in value. Adoption is low, potential is high. It might fail for a variety of reasons, sure, but - so far, so good. Thus, if I purchase some coins now for future spending, I am likely to get more value. Note how this is exactly the opposite of credit cards. With credit, you consume now, then pay extra in the future. With bitcoin, you can spend your dollars or euros now, then consume more later. Granted, the volatility might ruin it ocasionally, but more often than not it makes it better.

* if you are concerned with the relative change, log scale is more appropriate. One inch on the y-axis, always represents, for example, doubling of the price, regardless of the price. Our brains thus can see and process information better.  Linear scale is distorted in this way.
* If you are concerned with the absolute values, again the log scale is better, especially if values span several orders of magnitude. Linear scale destroys the precision and detail in the lower range of values.

This has been established and rediscovered over and over again: price drives the search volume, with occasional short-lived spikes due to big news (literally a day or two). The main driving factor is the price.
Likewise, price drives mining difficulty (especially if corrected for technology leaps from GPU to FPGA to ASIC).
Price pretty much drives all publicly available indicators.
What drives the price? Mostly chaos of thousands of investors, big and small, spiced up with insider information and pump'n'dump campaigns. No publicly available data is a predictor of the price trend.

Everything is fine. Back up your wallet first.
Next, you can either (1) run a new installation of bitcoin-qt from a stronger machine, and let it syncronize, and move your old wallet.dat to the new machine, or (2) dumprivkey from the old machine, and import that private key into some light(er) client (multibit, electrum, blockchain.info, mycelium...).
It'll takeyou a bit of googling and learning, but should be done in few hours with option 2.
