Tetherreport.com makes the whole thing at least looking suspicious 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:10:46
That's exactly what has happened in the last few months. Check tetherreport.com

That's good for bitcoin according to :D
High fees = good;
Slow Speed = good;
Altcoins aren't relevant.
Remember that and you will be a good part of the community here.

So all altcoins are ded aswell? Because their graphs look the same

Some people are in for the short term profit and bch treated me well in that regard :D

Thank you, one of the very few reasonable replys here in this whole and drama.
Bitcoin is not a religion! :D

I do, everytime i am buying something for a bigger amount of money (e.g. they wanted my driving licence last week at a zara store when i paid with a cc). In middle europe it's pretty common, especially for bitcoins as it is extremely easy to launder money.

That's something entirely different. Op exchanged the bitcoins for fiat money to pay for the surgery. 
Still, op is a fuckin great son!

Rolex aren't even good looking, buy an iwc.

Downplaying the situation as an usual attack is a bit delusional imho

So 1000 memes a day about the rising prices are okay but technical discussions are not?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:39:32
Wait 10 more minutes lol. Price is crashing atm with low lows and low highs.

What's the usd backed by? Only 5% of all the usd in circulation are backed by gold. It's worth something because you and me and most merchants on the planet agree that 100 usd are 100 usd. The sheet of paper the usd is printed on is definitely not worth the 100 usd.

But it's your business if i pay you with stolen money and the owner wants it back ;). If there's a single usd/btc exchange where you can pay with your cc without an id process, you can be sure as hell that criminals will use that service to cash out stolen credit cards.

Who said anything about bcash, i do not own any bcash and i believe there are many better options than bch. I just pointed out that btcs usability as currency (and that was originally the main purpose of the btc) is limited by its own flaws at the moment. No need to go into full defense mode, cryptocurrency is not a religion. High fees for single transactions are not positive, low fees but more transactions are wanted to open the bitcoin network to everyone.

Better to invest that money in cryptocoins i'd say, especially because you have to calculate the energy costs aswell! Buy some more btc and probably some eth :)

These South Korean exchanges have no trading fee, so it is easily possible that people are pumping the price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:11:31
Why should that be bad? it's common if you use big amounts of (FIAT) money to check who's behind the transfer so that they can trace you if you use a fake credit card or bloodmoney or whatever. You can always use a bitcoin atm if you do not want to do the verification process.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:46:29
What is it then? Hoping for the price to rise and eventually cash out with a big profit? I mean i do the same at the moment, but i understand that bitcoins and cryptos in general are moving on a thin line of trust. Right now, i am hoping that the bitcoin devs deliver and fix the problems the btc has at the moment and i stay invested because i know that the mass market doesn't know about the problems. But using it only as a store of value was not the original idea. The opportunity to replace the fiat currency was what gave the movement momentum and right now, it is at stake.

Before you invest, read about the problems the bitcoin currently has. I am not saying do not invest in bitcoin (my portfolio is 80% bitcoin), but there are certain problems at the moment that need to be fixed before we can go mainstream. One attempt to do that has been cancelled a week ago.
As others have said, do your research. I hold for now because i think the price will still rise (especially in december and for as long as the mainstream doesn't know about the problems), but i wouldn't sit it out and wait.

Is it succesful? It's less used than Dogecoin...
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:00:11
Mentioning a pump and dump scamcoin and ethereum in the same sentence is a bit of a stretch if you ask me.
