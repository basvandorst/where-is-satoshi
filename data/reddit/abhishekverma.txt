I'm from India and I'm extremely happy with this news. Being a uni student my main source of income is adsense, but still can't get a low rate credit card. Even my debit card won't work properly on sites like Steam and DigitalOcean. But I can still buy BTC easily.

I don't think that's available in either India or Australia. Never heard of it either.

I fucking love bitcoin man. Thank god I don't have to use those shady prepaid cards anymore. 
My debit card doesn't work with Steam, and since the bank employees told me freelancing as a student is not an actual job, I can't get a low limit credit card.
Buying bitcoin takes me about 5 minutes in all. And it's dreadfully easy.

I tried paying using an advcash card. It declined the payment. Cryptopay looks shady. Have you used it before?

Thanks mate. Will do.

Yeah this might be a better option. But I'm just a student, and I file my taxes using a registered CA ~100AUD. Do you think the price and the taxes would be higher for a "corporation"?

Prepaid cards are not all shady... in the western world. I have prepaid cards from I don't know which countries and don't know which language.

We have, but we have 2 factor auth enabled by all the banks by the direction of RBI. It's a good security move, no doubt, but it declines to work on PayPal or even DigitalOcean.

No gift cards, and LocalBTC FTW. And transferring money is a breeze in India for all of her complexities. It takes me about 5 mins to do a transfer but in countries like Australia they usually insist on cash deposits with a photograph of the receipt.

It's a first world thing. We have Woolies' gift cards in Australia, but they don't work with Steam. Also I heard somewhere PayPal blocks your account if you try to use a prepaid card?

Linux/Tor users are turrists and extremists, don't you know?
