I used to buy Bitcoins there until they started sending the money back to my bank account when I tried to deposit. Support is non existent. Had to switch to Bitstamp.

Because Paypal is based on fiat wich is scam. Why not wait and hodl until Bitcoin becomes easy?

While calling someone stupid isn't very friendly, a friend is someone you can call stupid without him getting mad.

Same, my point was more that you can talk honestly with a friend and be hard hitting in discussions.

What about inflation
What about counterfeit money
What about fiat being the biggest scam in the world
Discussion shut down.
Also Bitcoin won't be as volatile forever. Price stability will come when it's value is established.

Taxi accepting Bitcoin in 2019 = lambo in 2020

Last time when I sold something on ebay Paypal said I have to wait 2 weeks until I get my money because I was inactive for awhile.

Exactly and that makes it even better over the USD. Having something to measure it's value is something you don't have with USD. There you only see it's value when you want to buy something.

Yes exactly. I did several deposits with no problems but now they're rejecting for no reason. The support is just bot messages asking for the same infos over and over again.

Did you send any coins to this wallet?
Did you check rewievs and comments before you downloaded it?
How did you find it, just by browsing the playstore?
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:05:21
How does it work?

They also try to sell you their overpriced funds, ripping off clueless first time investors.

On which platform are you trading?
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:30:12
This is beautiful.

What's the reason for the inflation of your money?
@_date: 2019-10-28 06:53:28
I think he said it's 100-150 USD per person/month.
