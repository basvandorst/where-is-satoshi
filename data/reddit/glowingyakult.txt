 Everyone is going to downvote me but a backup is needed. It cant be if you lose your 1 key all your money is gone. People are lazy and wont back it up or store a spare copy. You cant compete with banks. Banks are easy, put your money in a bank if you lose your card go get a new one. Crypto if you lose your key good bye money. You think the average Joe is going to accept that.

 Nice work! Seems very well done. What if I later decide I want to host my store somewhere else? Is there a way to export my OB store?

 40kb makes it so that it is 1 floppy disk per hour (1.44/6) and 24 floppy disks per day which has a nice symmetry to the 0.24MB per block. There is also 144 blocks per day and the 1.44MB per hour is a nice overlap as well.

 BTC has completely stagnated. Other cryptos are running circles around it. Lightning network? What a fucking joke. Fix the first-layer first before selling second-layer shit to the users. Segwit? Nice try irreversibly changing the code and fundamental protocol in thousands of places for a small short term improvement.

 This is the exact same argument boomers have against bitcoin. You should be aware of the type of argument you are making, even if you believe what you are saying.

JP is rolling this out to save in infrastructure &amp; organizational costs. It's not some kind of profit engine. but it's basically a huge shot at Ri pple which was trying to do exactly this: JP just decided to cut the middle man out.

 Yes. It can be good to fund terrorism and wars. Or to store illicit drug/crime money.
