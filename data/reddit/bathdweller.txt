Because it's down 64% since December. If you take the data and smooth the trend, it's heading down currently. My point is, looking at current trends and assuming they will never change is retarded.
@_date: 2018-08-07 08:53:47
Because if one identifies a trend it is reasonable to just extrapolate them out endlessly. Take for instance the current Downard trend. I predict Bitcoin will be worth negative infinity dollars. To the antimatter moon!!
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:05:51
btc volume is displayed in the tealy colour. The $ is an indexing operator. I.e $ means volume is contained within the btc object. Let me know if I've misunderstood your suggestion!
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:45:33
Cost per transaction of Bitcoin is wayyyyy higher than Fiat by far. A household's energy per month to do one transaction. This is a major problem. Bitcoin is currently unsustainable and can't afford to keep growing.
@_date: 2018-08-20 04:59:09
Almost impossible. Would need to account for mass human psychology but you only have things like volume as an input. Any regression model would have gigantic residual spikes making them useless and dangerous.

Created this plot in R to show trends in volume and price without distractions of constant bart cycles.

'24 hour volume' from coin market cap, I assumed trade volume but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:44:43
What do you mean by manipulation?
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:24:17
Yes, but but the stability seems to be due to low volume of trading rather than BTC being any more robust. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:30:43
You using R? Use ggplot and just apply geom_smooth(). Also will be easier to read if volume is on x and price on y.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:14:10
I don't know, the price is dropping pretty quickly.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:49:27
Do you mean to say that this is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:41:25
Even if the whole world switches to crypto (big if) we don't know which currency will take over.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:54:52
The idea of currency being replaced with crypto is plausible but extremely unlikely that it will be Bitcoin. Will probably be government developed and rolled out. Most people need to be forced and bullied to change their ways in a such a major fashion.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:23:32
No I mean filter the data to include only higher prices. As you say the covariance is not even across the values of x and y. Therefore you don't have a single correlation statistic- you have a moving statistic. The assumptions for a linear relationship have been violated. You can however see how the correlation changes across different degments of data.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:11:16
It's true you can't conclude anything from it as it's cross-sectional. But I bet the correlation is nowhere near that strong if you filter the data for larger market prices.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:36:56
If everyone just bought and held, your coins would be nothing but really boring Pokemon cards.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:25:08
What's interesting is the correlation between price and volume seems to have gotten weaker as price has gone up. Clearly everyone is hodling even when no one is buying.

Quantum computers allows people to steal BTC. 10c.
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:34:20
Ah OK makes sense. I don't think I can get adjusted volume with the package I'm currently using.

'A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.'
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:07:27
The fact that you think Bitcoin won't hit infinity dollars within the hour shows that you know nothing about making money with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:37:07
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:38:56
Humble beginnings.
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:59:19
Ah I see, that makes sense. That's really only an issue if you control for the amount of Bitcoin sold. Buyers can purchase an unlimited amount of btc dependent only on the amount of fiat they are willing to invest. Their willingness to do that is represented by volume. But if you fix the amount of btc bought and sold the metric becomes pretty useless. Is there an adjusted form of volume which is superior?
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:30:32
Buy Bitcoin, purchase lottery tickets, win, invest in tulips, profit.

We do seem to just be on a shorts cycle at the moment. People rush in at 6k and out at 7.5ish.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:40:48
Do you mean they have chosen to stop buying? What do you think they are doing to keep it at this level?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:24:49
Only way he has coins to sell is if he bought them first. Sounds like you want to cash out at some point so what's the problem?
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:29:57
If you bought 3 years ago, yes its a great value store. If you wanted to protect your wealth buying now would be risky as fuck.
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:46:58
Sounds  to me.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:46:19
I think short sellers have found their ceiling has lowered hence the flatlining. They were hoping it would go to 7.5 for a quick win but it ran out of puff. They're all selling off so that they can buy in with a lower baseline and start the game again.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:17:34
People buy into gold because it retains its value. It's very low risk. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Bitcoin couldn't be a worse candidate for use as a value store.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:43:47
End of the shorts cycle. Not news based.
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:51:11
That depends on when a given person bought.
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:20:49
Yeah that's actually textbook for how economys collapse and everyone becomes unemployed.

@_date: 2018-06-29 05:10:51
Sure, there's a cost and benefit.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:40:48
*infinity dollars.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:15:49
This whole 'Banks use electricity too' counterargument is fully retarded. I'm amazed you guys keep it up.
The issue is the energy cost per transaction. due to excessive mining 1 single Bitcoin transaction costs 1005 kilowatt hours. Meanwhile 100,000 visa transactions costs 169 kilowatt hours. 
a household consumes 15 kwh per day...
How can you guys not see that there's a problem here. At least do the honest thing and pretend it doesn't exist rather than make these embarrassing counter claims.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:03:02
I think it was a better time to invest when BTC was worth 0.01 usd.
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:21:39
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:46:45
This article is retarded. Comparing Bitcoin to cash printing is crazy. Much more cash and gold is traded than Bitcoin. You need to look at the energy usage per transaction. Bitcoin uses the equivalent of a households energy consumption over a month per transaction. The fact that anyone tries to defend that baffles the fuck out of me.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:21:23
A lot of people in the general public bought in around December hoping to double their investment. Price rose until everyone who was interested was in. Then it peaked and people started leaving as they grew concerned they would lose their money. That massive pool of buyers (including my little sister, a total technophobe) are still leaving. There's a lot of room for the price to deflate.
Bitcoin can't moon unless new blood becomes interested. Unfortunately part of the reason it mooned last year was the narrative that Bitcoin has only ever gone up making it a sure bet. I think this new track record of major prolonged devaluation is going to slow things up a bit. People are afraid to get burned.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:58:51
With the energy consumption used by 1 Bitcoin transaction you could power more than 100000 visa transactions.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:41:58
Government's actually do a lot to stabilize dollar value.   Having no levers to pull could be disasterous.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:33:09
Phenomenon just means an occurrence. They can have explanations.

He's assuming all his coins are worthless and any later gain will be a nice surprise.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:22:30
Don't worry it's on a long-term downward trend!
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:18:00
It's probably not going to work out to be more than 486kg of co2 released per financial transaction like Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:03:09
Yeah so you're right, I dont think Bitcoin is great. I think it's massively problematic for a number of reasons. But im interested in engaging with peoole who have oppossing views. The idea that we should spearate people up by their beliefs and only talk to people who agree with us is dangerous.
I get that many of you want a circle jerk sub but honestly I don't even see how that suits your aims. Don't you want to convince the general public to adopt Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:01:44
Yeah not worth the hairloss!

Isn't that the whole point of this sub?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:55:43
If you're hodling you don't believe in Bitcoin. It's a currency not a stock.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:05:01
Hopefully he gets some good use out of it. We should mail him some lube.
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:00:01

@_date: 2018-03-30 23:29:56
Thank you so much for gold! :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:03:01
It's a shame everybody didn't buy then. But I suppose if they had, the price would have spiked then fallen and roughly half would be up and half would be down.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:17:59
How can Bitcoin get anyone rich? The only way you can get a big payout is if another person who also thinks Bitcoin is a great idea gives it to you. The fact that you all think Bitcoin is going to make you rich, and that's why you're 'investing' shows how volatile the currency is. You can't just buy in to do your shopping with btc because some kid online is hoping he can fleece you based on that decision. This will spook people who aren't just speculators like yourselves.
Maybe Bitcoin will make you rich. Or, maybe you've donated your money to make a previous Bitcoin user rich.
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:04:10
No thanks.

You're in control of how many bitcoins you have but you have no control over whether or not it will be enough to make rent. Good in principal but not stable enough to store value. Perhaps the stable coins like usdcoin will be able to achieve this though.
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:42:25
In times of financial crisis people tend to pull money out of volatile investments and place them into stable ones e.g. gold. That way they can ride out the storm and re enter markets when things have calmed down.
Putting money into crypto would be a very risky move during financial instability. People with money in coins may have to start taking it out if they lose their jobs.
Bitcoin has always been viewed with suspicion because it has little to no intrinsic value. The reason why it boomed is probably because it seemingly had a flawless track record of constant growth.  This year has devastated that credential. It's going to take a big psychological movent to turn that perception around.
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:04:02
If you had sold in January and then rebought now, you would have 2.5x as much bitcoin. Regardless of what happens you fucked up this year.
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:24:23
Stock standard metric for investment. Also an important proof for a value store. You wouldn't have had an issue with the time period if Bitcoin increased in 2018. Check your biases.

How does Bitcoin make someone money? Someone else buys it for more. It's not generating wealth it's redistributing it. All these lambos were bought for a lucky few by hodlers. On average half the people who get into Bitcoin will lose money and half will win (before taxation). Unless you can convince more people to get into Bitcoin than when you did, you've probably lost your money.
