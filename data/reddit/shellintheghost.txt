Nope I’m not selling any AMZN no matter what.  Same with gold coins.
Also, Donald Trump is a much bigger threat to AMZN than Jerome Powell is.

The reason it will disrupt banks is that they create money (along with debt to balance it out), but can't create bitcoin.

They are created at the same time. Read Modern Money Mechanics, a document created by the Federal Reserve.
The act of creating debt through a loan is the act of creating new money that didn't exist before, simply by increasing the balance of deposit accounts.

I still don't understand this long-term bullishness.  If anything I would approach Bitcoin as a short-term trade or speculation, not the other way around.  Bitcoin does't have a monopoly on cryptocurrencies and is backed up by absolutely nothing.  It has no fundamental analysis because there are no fundamentals.  Sorry if I'm naive, ignorant or incorrect, just my two cents
