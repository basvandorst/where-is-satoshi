The transactions are formatted differently, and each require a signature which cannot be duplicated since the format is different... so no, you can't just take a transaction from BCH and submit it on BTC or vice-versa.

Bitcoin Cash became a coin before Segwit became a coin. The only difference between the CURRENT Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size. Bitcoin Cash 1, Segwit Coin 0.

No. Users post BTC for sale at a given price. You can take the price or leave it. It's up to you. The purpose of bitsquare is to buy and sell bitcoin without going through a central authority. There is no record of your transactions except between you and the seller. You can sell your own bitcoin there too.

So blocks are bigger to allow more space for the non-witness data. This is the 0.7MB increase everyone keeps referring to? So if the blockchain is actually getting bigger under Segwit, and it is not actually saving blockspace, what is your argument that a simple block size increase is not better. Isn't it a problem to run a node on  Rasberry Pi if the blocksize is not 1.7MB just as much as it would be if we did a simple blocksize increase to 1.7MB?
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:25:57
I'm not wrong. You just go ahead and keep your transactions in Segwit addresses and I'll keep mine in Bitcoin addresses. You may pay $0.10 for your transaction and I may pay $0.25 for mine... but we'll see who is right over time when invalid transactions start becoming a part of the blockchain. Your assumption is that people will prefer the Segwit transaction because they're not willing to spend an extra $0.15 to ensure that their bitcoin is secure.
Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell just admitted that the problem of invalid transactions on the blockchain has not been addressed in the current Segwit implementation.

The 2MB hardfork is only applicable to btc1 nodes. Core won't implement the HF.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:17:18
Unless you are new to bitcoin, you must have some sort of idea about how a huge reason for using bitcoin is its immutable security. People care more about the security of their money than paying lower fees. A big-block chain would have lower fees anyway so your point is moot. On the Segwit chain, I would rather secure my bitcoin with $0.62 than pay $0.22 for an insecure coin. This is why Litecoin has had Segwit for months and yet virtually nobody is using Segwit transactions.
Satoshi defined a bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures. What, then, is an address without a signature? It's definitely not a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:57:22
So, like I said, since bitcoin is at ATH without Segwit, ATH and Segwit are mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:31:24
It surged for like a week, but you conveniently ignore the fact that it plummeted almost immediately. Pro Segwitters and pro big blockers have both agreed that Segwit is less secure than Bitcoin as-is. There is no need for a complicated solution to a non complicated problem. An attacker would be stupid to attack Litecoin before Segwit activates on Bicoin where the reward would be magnitudes higher.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:44:29
Core does not equal Bitcoin. The term "Core" was intentionally used to make it sound like THE official team. The reality is that there is no official team. Core is just one of a number of dev teams who work on Bitcoin. They are not and have never been any sort of authority on Bitcoin protocol. Consensus is the authority.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:54:31
Segwit only adds space when one uses a Segwit transaction... and since a signature-less bitcoin is not as secure, people will value regular bitcoin transactions more and not keep their coins in a less secure Segwit address.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:25:06
I never said it was easy. I never said it would even happen... Only that it is admittedly less secure. Prove that someone stole your coins when the blockchain does not contain your signature. That is the point.
Bitcoin is at all time highs at the same time as well without Segwit. Your point is meaningless. Being at ATH and Segwit activation are mutually exclusive according to your own logic.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:03:33
On the chain, there is no signature. What's incorrect about that?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:07:06
Your comment is ridiculous because bitcoin has hardforked in the past with zero problems whatsoever.
Being backward and forward compatible has nothing to do with how bitcoin was designed to be upgraded. A hardfork is not dangerous and does not lead to a split chain unless significant hashpower mines each chain... which is the case with BTC/BCH. That's part of the beauty of bitcoin. Anyone can do whatever they want with it since it is open source. If you don't agree, fork. May the best chain win.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:45:54
No, it uses a hash to relate the transaction back to the off-chain signatures... Which can be circumvented with 51% of the hashpower. The signatures are not verifiable on the chain.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:32:40
What's FUD about my statement? I, myself, would rather pay $0.50 for a secure transaction that includes my signature than $0.10 for an insecure transaction without my signature.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:51:55
In what way is a 2mb hard fork a threat? Hard fork is the original design. Soft fork is way more dangerous (re: UASF).

I believe he means the fees to deposit and withdraw from a bank. It's pretty outrageous at BTC-e.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:42:40
Some smart people disagree with you about this topic... like Peter Rizun, for example. A miner can mine blocks without witnessing the previous signatures. That's what Segwit allows for. The signatures are not required to be kept on the chain itself in order for a block to be valid under Segwit protocol.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:46:08
Says you.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:04:12
A miner is not required, under Segwit protocol, to include the signature data in the blockchain itself. They can, but they are not required to, and there is an economic incentive for them not to.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:52:37
Core needs to be fired. However it happens, it will be good for bitcoin. Segwit reduces security and is unnecessary. Bitcoin scales as-is. Even after it activates, nobody will keep their coins in a Segwit address because there is no incentive to keep a signature-less coin on the chain when you can just move it to a regular bitcoin address with a verifiable signature. Segwit will activate, and then die a natural death. This is all for naught.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:15:20
Miner finds a block, changes the destination of the no-signature transactions, and then adds it to the blockchain. The 49% chain validates the legit blocks. The 51%, longer chain wins. The 49% chain is orphaned. Nodes can't validate which was legit because signatures are off chain, right? So they assume the longer chain is legit and confirm confirm confirm.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:28:34
So Core making those decisions is better somehow?
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:25:13
No it isn't. Segwit is a soft fork, meaning, it is still compatible with the old client. Hard fork is not compatible with the old client, which is why it's a hard fork.
Segwit activation still considers pre-Segwit transactions valid. This is vastly documented if you want to look it up. You can still send a non-Segwit transaction with a non-Segwit wallet even after Segwit activates.

I've considered purchasing a domain and running an email server from home, but as I researched it, it was more complicated than my brainpower was willing to indulge at the time. Maybe I'll look at that again.

@_date: 2017-06-19 16:11:16
If they do it on Litecoin now, before it activates on the Bitcoin network, there is no way that even a single miner/node would activate it on the Bitcoin network. They're simply biding their time.
2 million is not enough for them to do this anyway, since it will undermine the entire network and plummet the price. Also, almost all Litecoin wallets still use the old non-Segwit method... so most LTC transactions aren't susceptible to this type of attack. When all the BTC wallets/exchanges move to implement Segwit for transactions, we have a much bigger problem on our hands than Litecoin has now.

@_date: 2017-06-20 22:05:40
As long as the old transactions are compatible with Segwit, you can still generate valid blocks on the main chain, even if you run the old code.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:06:49
Yeah. I was naive. My assumption was that it was possible, so I just wanted to see how.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:40:10
What is Bitcoin's market cap? A coordinated government effort could easily take it down.
The point of Bitcoin is to be completely immutable and trusless. Segwit makes it a lot easier to accomplish an attack of this nature, am I not right?
Practicality matters not if the goal is to destroy Bitcoin and maintain the current banking system.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:44:22
Doing it literally one time on a high-value block could result in millions(if not hundreds of millions) of dollars. Bitcoin is meant to be completely trustless. It must always assume that someone is going to try to attack it. That's the whole point.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:48:08
As I understand it, it is the 51% miners using the older version of the code that see blank signatures in the Segwit transactions, so they can redirect the output to their own address and place it on the blockchain. The 49% Segwit-enforcing miners validate the blocks with the legit transaction output addresses, but when the 51% chain wins, the 49% chain is orphaned, and all the Nodes merge with the main chain and the orphaned blocks are lost, and those transactions go back to the mempoool.
So with 51% hashpower, a miner using the non-Segwit code can immediately spend the Segwit transactions, then their chain wins and those transactions are considered valid because their chain is the only chain to survive. I had it a little backwards, but this is what I believe the issue is. Not that the 49% can't validate signatures, since you are right, they are enforcing Segwit, but the 51% chain is the only one to survive. Orphaned blocks happen all the time, and this is how it works for orphaned blocks currently.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:59:34
Pre-Segwit transactions are compatible under the Segwit protocol. I suppose it depends on which Segwit implementation though.

@_date: 2017-06-20 22:10:56
Not if you are the miner who found the block. This is why Segwit is not trustless. You have to trust the miners. On-chain scaling does not require that trust. That was the whole purpose of Bitcoin, which the community seems to forget.

I have a daily transaction at a particular time, and they waited an hour and a half after the scheduled time until it bumped up $150 before actually initiating the buy. Um... if I have a daily buy at a set time, you need to honor the price at the time it was originally scheduled for you fucking scam artists. Yes it's intentional. It is not a coincidence that this happens literally every time there's a dip.

The non-legit chain is still compatible with Segwit. That is the point. Segwit does not invalidate pre-Segwit transactions, even after it activates.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:05:12
Yeah, I am not really explaining what I mean clearly. I mean the blockchain itself should be immutable, which it is not under Segwit.
Non-Segwit transactions are compatible under Segwit, which is what the problem is. Transactions under Segwit are sent through without signatures, and a 51% hashpower miner can revert the code to pre-Segwit, which would still generate valid blocks under the new Segwit protocol, and then steal the signature-less Bitcoins. Yes, it would plummet the price, but that may be the very goal of such an attack.
Bitcoin must have a solution for impractical situations. That is what makes it trustless in the first place.

@_date: 2017-06-20 05:11:42
Segwit activates. Miners roll back to pre-Segwit. On-chain transactions are now without signature. 51% hash power makes those empty signatures spendable by the miners. What do I have wrong?

@_date: 2017-07-31 18:57:06
Segwit protocol verifies the integrity of the signatures, but no... the signatures are not required to be on the chain. They are validated on each individual miner's node but do not have to appear in the chain itself in order to be considered valid under Segwit protocol.... so an attack block would be valid under Segwit protocol... and since the attack block is still technically valid according to Segwit protocol, the 49% shorter chain would eventually be abandoned for the 51% attack-block chain. It appears it is you who has no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:59:13
Immutable, meaning, it cannot be defrauded. Segwit makes it possible through a coordinated 51% hashpower attack.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:52:05
I clarified my post. It could literally be one transaction different between the two chains. As long as it is a big one.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:00:24
You are confusing the word "legit" with "valid." Those are not the same thing.
It is not an *invalid* transaction on either chain. It is not **legit**, but it is *valid* on both chains. The longer chain wins and everyone confirms the one with the *valid*, **illegitimate** transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:14:01
We can't rely on the fact that the price would plummet as a reason they wouldn't do it... because that might not matter to a nefarious actor (think, the Federal Reserve, for example, who has unlimited funds and could easily coordinate this type of attack).
I agree that price would plummet... but taking governments and pro-fiat entities out of it, think about it from the perspective of a singular actor/mining cartel. We need to assume the worst. If it results in them stealing 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin, that then becomes worth 10 million, they still made out with 10 million for themselves, at the expense of the entire network. It is absolutely necessary to have a failsafe against this type of attack.
Segwit opens the door for this to happen without any real recourse if we have one powerful entity that decides to capitalize on it. We need a plan to stop it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:59:59
If 51% of the hashpower could essentially make it possible to steal Bitcoin, which Segwit enables, Segwit does not create a more immutable Bitcoin than Satoshi's original vision of Bitcoin.
