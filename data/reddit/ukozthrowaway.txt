Thank you for using the correct plural form

In that case, I'm selling 100 iota on eBay for only $4 if you're interested!

I would disagree that people hold in order to make fiat
Rather they hold because as btc (or any crypto) grows in market cap the value increases. While yes it's the fiat value but also scarcity, meaning that your cars worth of btc could be work a house in a year, or your burgers worth might be worth a car, completely skipping around fiat (although I imagine even with mass adoption of any, fiat will still be usable in most situations)

Why do you think it's called *cold* storage?

The direction of crypto in general?

Haha it was a throwaway that I didn't end up throwing away.
You're right, but I think it's just because it's still early stages. We're all still getting in early while the developers are doing all the work.
There are numerous cryptos which still aim for decentralized ledger/currency, and slowly but surely it'll be adopted. Today more than yesterday and tomorrow more than today, but it's only incremental. I don't think the vision has been lost, people are just waiting (and in the meantime playing with risky PnDs).
Just like when internet came about - you could invest in the new companies even if you weren't using the internet, and hope that they founders put in the hard yards to make it happen

So that's what Lincoln meant with the slaves

I'm not quite sure what you're getting at. Unless we all open up our laptops and start learning code, there's not much else we can do. I can't even code on Excel, so I just research into who is aiming to solve a real-world problem with blockchain tech, and I buy some of their crypto.
Then once, for (shitty) example, I want to buy music directly from an artist, or a book/paper from an author, I would be able to use X crypto in order to do that. Buying now when there are 1000 holders means that my $10 will be worth $100 when there are 10,000 investors.
I guess cryptos are new deflationary gift cards.
I see what you're getting at now I guess, that people are investing rather than pioneering - and I agree, but I'm fine riding this wave and letting the others do the work, as founders will own many many more coins/tokens than I do and their holdings will be worth one hundred-fold more than mine.

Is it possible that the exchanges sold their fat stacks to make some extra cash? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:16:15
Why would they do that?

It's only truly cold storage if you put it in the freezer. While defrosted the value is susceptible to change

I think Bitcoin will be left in the dust personally.

So unless every exchange avoids NK, and every bank avoids exchanges that interact with NK, it's possible

It'll hit $50k in 2018 but crash before the start of 2019. This is my prediction

The blockchain is also antifragile

Saaaarrryyyyy, i'd never seen it before..

Don't compare to yesterday. Invest some time first looking into the tech and the idea - not just for btc but for altcoins as well, and decide for yourself whether you see it growing and still being here in a few years, then decide how much you want to invest.

Just keep in mind the possibility of it going to $0. If you bought early enough it may take a while for you to not make a profit, but it's still possible. Imagine instead of having suck good fortune you bought at $19,000 and then watched it drop all the way down to $10,000.
It's not *certainly* going up, even though it may seem like that. Name a figure you'd happily sell at when it's rising so you don't get greedy, and name one that you'll happily sell at when it's falling so you don't get left holding the bag

Exactly, think which will cost more? These fees or missing the growth?

Because cash transactions can be reversed, btc cannot
