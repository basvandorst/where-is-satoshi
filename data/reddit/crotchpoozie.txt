Be sure you understand [expected return]( 
Here is one generalization: start with N dollars, chance p of making M times your money back on a single game. Then playing a single game for N dollars has expected return of 0 * (1-p)+MN * p = **MNp** expected return.
Playing N one dollar games in a row has expected return given by the binomial theorem: 0 * (1-p)^N + M (1-p)^(N-1) * p (N choose 1) + 2M * (1-p)^(N-2) * p^2 (N choose 2)+ ... + MN p^N = **MNp**
Same result. Both strategies have the same expected return. Split the bets into any size and order you want. Same expected return.
Why? The game has no memory. Odds of winning any single game is the same, so the expected return on a single game is always the same, and the sum of expected returns is the expected return of the sum since expectation is a linear functional.
This is true:
E[1 bet of n1+n2+n3+...+nk dollars] = sum of i from 1 to k of E[ni dollar bet]
Again, you're wrong.

Wrong. 
As I said, "backing is different than insuring".
In fractional reserve banking, your demand deposits can be loaned out up to the reserve requirement. This loan is *backed* by collateral for the loan. The collateral has value the bank can seize if the borrower defaults on payments. 
For example, if the loan is a mortgage, the value of your money in the bank is *backed* by the mortgage agreement, which provides a cash flow to the bank. This cash flow in turn is *backed* by the asset, in this case the property. 
If the bank miscalculates how much money people want to withdraw at a given time, then a run on the bank can cause liquidity problems, because the mortgages, which have real value, pay at a different rate than the people want withdrawals. 
This is backing your money in fractional reserve. Assets.
This happens even without the FDIC, so the backing has *zero* to do with them. They solve a different problem.
Banks used to (and still sometimes do) lose money through bad action, bad loans, etc., and this causes panic from people, who decide to withdraw more money than they really would normally, and this can spill over to healthy banks (banks which have a healthy cash flow under normal circumstances), all caused by fear. 
The FDIC *insures* against bank deposits being stolen, banks losing the money from bad action, etc. This lowers the fear in people, thus lowering the severity or frequency of banks runs.
Repeat after me : "Backing is different than insurance".
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:23:06
No, it is not quite a martingale, since the original question, which you have yet to address, is whether or not it is better to bet all at once **or split the same amount across multiple bets**. It is not about betting smaller amounts, about betting more than you started with, or making up non-existent or losing games for the casino. 
A martingale allows you to bet winnings back into the system. I'm well aware of them as well as the much more abstract class of martingales used in statistics.
Please acknowledge that you understand the difference between the original question and all the side stuff you're throwing in, or I'm done - your methods and claims so far have been wrong, do not address the point we were discussing, and I'm tiring of trying to correct all your errors.

With probability 1 a martingale system loses all your money. With a single bet you have nonzero expected return. Who cares if you win a single bet along the way if you end at zero with probability 1? This is trivial. Of course if you play more times you're expected to win more *games* but that does not mean more *money*. 
If you stop at the first win the single bet has expected value 32 * 99/(32/31) = 30.69 while the stop on first win double your bet version has (p=0.495) expected value 32 p + 32 (1 - p) p + 32 (1 - p)^2 p + 32(1 - p)^3 p + 32 (1 - p)^4 p = 30.949.
Why would you care that you're more likely to win a single hand in the second game when you're expected to lose far more money?

Ah, so you inserted the word "Libertarian" in what I wrote that to form an argument with people in your head. I was only referring the the "batshit insane" subset that thinks the Constitution is some holy document, and who misread and misunderstand it in order to worship it. 
The post you replied to used the phrase "batshit insane libertarians", as in the intersection of the sets "batshit insane" and "libertarian," not as "all libertarians are batshit insane". Man you are a paranoid or hyper-defensive person.
If I wrote "stupid white people drag their knuckles" would you read that as me claiming all white people are stupid, or that I am referring to a subset of them? If I wrote "red cars are nice" would you read that as all cars are red, or the subset of cars which are also red?

He wrote more than that. He wrote: ["Or if you're going to do it, you get the best odds by placing a single all-in bet, rather than spacing them out."](


No - I specifically compared the bet as one single bet to one broken into smaller bets. Again read more carefully.
No one is disputing if you can stop betting or bet infinitely often that the expected return changes - not betting at all has expected loss of 0. Since no bet is 0 expected loss and *any* bet is positive expected loss, there is nothing to do for this case. It's trivial.
If you bet winnings without a stopping condition, your expected losses are the entire starting amount. This too is trivial. No where did I claim otherwise.
I proved that if you bet N units the expected return does not change no matter how you split it into pieces. This was not trivial, and apparently the related concepts are foreign to most bitcoiners. You for example kept thinking "return" was the phrase when it's "expected return." It's like trying to provide proofs to middle school kids.

Thank you. You finally see the light.
**You** might find it worth $600 a day, but all of your previous posts made it sound like this was the norm for the group of "self-employed people [who] use gmail", so your claim of "3 million x 600" is complete bullshit, as I claimed.

None, because central banking makes an economy more stable and robust. No country is dumb enough to do it any more.

@_date: 2014-02-27 17:55:58


Which argument is that exactly? You put a value on all these items you list as $600/day. I called you on it as bullshit which a simple estimate demonstrates;  your $600 a day claim adds up to $156K (only counting  work days a week, otherwise 365*600=$219K) a year. It's ridiculous to claim it's worth this much to any but a very few self-employed workers.
The only stupidity is making up values without a simple reality check.
[This claims the average income of a self employed person is $26K]( When the average wage is 1/5 to 1/10th of the yearly claim you put on value, how is this even remotely a believable value?
So - link to where you got the $600/day value (of course we both know you just pulled it from your ass).

The phrase is "expected return", not "return", and it has a well defined meaning in this context. He did not write "return" multiple times; he wrote "expected return" each time.
[Expected return]( is precisely the sum of the probability of each event times the value of that event.

I did. Your claim is ridiculous for the masses. 
Your estimate, based on your claim of $600 a day, which you pulled from your ass since the poster above you used the concrete figure of $600, then you back projected to make the value match *you*, which you then extrapolated to the entire class of people, which is most likely complete nonsense. You claim &gt; $150K a year on average for self employed people. Who average an income of $26K a year. It's so unlikely that most self employed people would value email at 150K when they average $26K a year in income.


Yes, your $600 is a really critical analyses of the value, which you then fed into your cycle of nonsense. Garbage in, garbage out. 
You sir are an idiot if you think that applies to them on average. 150K+ a year. For all of the millions of self employed people. 
For fun, I asked several self employed people at a local makerspace if they thought email was worth $600/day to them. I explained the reason. They *all* laughed. Sample size 8. Your claim is ridiculous, except possibly for a tiny few, in which case assuming that it apples to all shows "no ability for critical thought or the ability to abstract". I guess that is your phrase for "making up bullshit and believing it".
You have yet to show that $600 is remotely close to the value with any sources, links to data, surveys, *anything*. You made it up ad are so Dunning Krueger or Aspergers or whatever that you cannot just admit it's nonsense.

You've already shown what you know.
You only try to deflect into side comments instead of dealing directly with your first claim, which is a sign you're not coherent, and lacking the ability to clarify or demonstrate your original claim.
For example, I take it you believe a store of value is a true/false quality, which aligns with your black/white understanding of nuanced reality. Since your reality differs from the real one, this might help you understand your own question: ["As long as a currency is relatively stable in its value, money (such as a dollar bill) is the most common and efficient store of value found in an economy.

You are not betting by the rules set out above. If you're allowing cases where not all money gets bet at some point, then not playing at all has expected value equal to the original value, which becomes best possible. It's not clever at all to bet less money and thus lose less money. That's obvious. 
But this is not the original statements.
Next, your math is not right. The game is, for example, double or nothing. You wrote that you want to double your money from 1 unit to 2 units. Picking your strategy:
Bet $1. You win $2 with probability p=49.5% and lose leaving $0 with probability 50.5%, so the expected value is $2 * 0.495+$0 * 0.505 = $0.99. You expect to lose a penny, so you're correct.
Second game: You bet A =r-1 (withholding B=2-r), so have 2A (+B from holding back) with probability p and only B with probability 1-p. Nowhere have you doubled your money. You *might* have doubled the A part, but more likely than that you lost it. **You never doubled your money to $2 ever in this case.**
Thus, with probability 1-p, you continue and bet B. In this case you end with 2B with probability p for this roll times 1-p for the probability you reached this case, or you end with 0 with probability 1-p for this roll, times 1-p for the probability you reached this case. **You never doubled your money to $2 ever in this case.**
Thus the total expected value is (2A+B) * p +(2Bp) * (1-p)=0.9929. There is no way to reach 2 units. Your expected loss is 0.0071, not 0.0083. I don't know how you got that number.
So it is mathematically impossible to ever reach your claimed goal of "Suppose you have 1 unit and want to double it to 2 units" with the second strategy.
**But you changed the rules by not betting all the money at some point, which was not what was under discussion. We were discussing whether or not betting it all at once or all over smaller bets has any difference in expected return.** It does not make a difference on expected return.

I'm self employed, and am fully aware of how income and flows work. This is why I immediately saw your $600/day email value as pulled from your ass.

Expected return is the same. Proof:
Suppose you can play a game with odds of doubling your money each toss with probability p. You can bet all at once or in pieces. You have $2 and decide to play all at once (for one game then leave) or two $1 games (again, only playing those two games). Note if you continue to play you are expected to lose all your money for p&lt;1/2, and if the house bankroll is large enough compared to yours, you are expected to lose all your money for p&lt;2/3.
$2 game: Expected return is 0 * (1-p)+4 * p=4p.
Two one dollar games: expected return 0 * (1-p)^2 +2 * p * (1-p)+2 * (1-p) * p+4 * p^2 = 2p-2p^2 +2p-2p^2 +4p^2 =4p.
Same result.

Coming from religious BitCoiner, I take that as a compliment.


Yes, this is the fun part. Watching you (in many threads besides this one) argue this point is beyond funny. It's like OCD ^ (Dunning Krueger).


Ah, so instead of the one you wrote, I was to read your "intent" and realize you meant the other one. Gotcha. How about you write what you mean and not assume others can read your mind?


You mean other than every single post I made in this thread? How about you read what was written and not what goes on in your mind?


Despite repeated clear statements that this is not what I was writing about? Again, how about you stick to what was written, and not what is in your head.


Wait, so after all the other tangents you tried, multiple definitions, multiple arguments, not you're making the claim you're trying to just get on topic, which means a topic *you* choose, regardless of the obvious question about the phrases "distinctly libertarian" and your list of ideals, now you say all along you were trying to get bitcoin? Even after I repeatedly pointed out I don't care about how they are related, or whether or not those ideals fit in both places?
You have an odd way of wandering from topic to topic without actually resolving anything.


Words have meaning. You cannot just use them in a discussion as you feel they are used, especially if someone writes (as others also did) that your usage is wrong. Claiming some ideals as "distinctly libertarian" implies others don't have those ideals. End of story. You even reinforce this in your answer to 1, which I cover there.


Then you add things *not* listed in the ideals. Nowhere did I write that Republicans had anything to do with bitcoin, or anything about other ideals than those listed. 
Let's explore this further: which of the following are true? Both, A, B, neither?
"Bitcoin was founded on principles including limited government, less central planning and central control, and more free market principles, which are **distinctly Republican** principles." 
"Bitcoin was founded on principles including limited government, less central planning and central control, and more free market principles, which are **distinctly Libertarian** principles." 


No, they are not. That's why there are two of them.


Even though I stated that was the reason? And you answered with paragraph after paragraph? Amusing.


Thank you. 


Nope - I just pointed out (again, as did many others) that your claim was incorrectly worded. Do you often continue to play along so long just to avoid admitting you worded something incorrectly? If your main goal was to discuss the relation between Libertarianism and Bitcoin's founding principles, all you ever had to say was that using the word "distinctly" was a poor choice, change it, and move on. But you didn't. Why? Because you're too afraid of admitting any fault, even though many posters pointed it out?
You are amazingly fun.

Yes, this means of all teams under consideration, the underdogs have a unique quality. No one assumes in this statement it means "compared to all people on earth". When used in this context it usually means between the underdog team and the opposing team, in which case *only* the underdog team possesses this quality. Note that using "distinct" in this case means "no other element of the set under consideration has this property". Distinct - you got it. Your example is not helping your argument.
Comparing this to stating these are "distinctly libertarian," what are the likely things being compared against? Salt shakers? Days of the week? Flavors of cheese? All humans? Redditors? Or perhaps political parties or political ideologies? The latter seems pretty likely, based on context. Correct me if salt shakers was the correct answer.
Now, which of those ideals are "distinctly" group A or B? What if all groups or many groups have the property. Would you then say "distinct"? I think not.
Would you say "two eyes" is a "distinctly American Trait" - after all, most Americans have this trait, even though non-Americans do too. Would you say "breathing" is a "distinctly Russian" thing to do? Even though it's shared by many others?
Of course not.  Those things are not "distinctly" because they are not unique to the element of the set under consideration.
Your example helps my point. The ideals you call "distinctly libertarian" are shared by many parties.

Really? Is that why you quoted a different definition? (["clear to the senses or intellect; plain; unmistakable: The ship appeared as a distinct silhouette"](
You have an odd way of claiming that you chose the new one, which you never mentioned until now. Of course, expecting you to waffle around like this, I didn't cover the one you're now claiming is the one you chose on purpose, and I will address that contingent on the questions below.
You're like a crazy whack-a-mole player, hoping if you change positions and claims enough you might get one to work. It's funny.


I have never opined on that one way or another. Why do you feel it's important to change topic? Trying to avoid having to make a simple admission you're wrong about the claim "ideals that are **distinctly** libertarian" with those ideals being "limited government, less central planning and central control, and more free market principles".


Where exactly did I say they are not tied together? Are you arguing with crazy people in your head and projecting that argument onto me?
Let me state again, and please read and absorb this: I am not arguing **anything** about Bitcoin. I am arguing that you claimed the ideals of "limited government, less central planning and central control, and more free market principles" are "ideals that are **distinctly** libertarian". Those are your quotes. 
That you keep trying to pull this into a Bitcoin argument, when I've repeatedly said it's not an issue, highlights some need you have to prove to the world Bitcoin satisfies some beliefs you have. Personally I don't care if Bitcoin was founded on Nordic cheesemaker chants. It is what it is. I do find it fascinating how many times you point out to me the link, even making claims as to my position (which there isn't one), so as to further some conversation you're having in your head.
Now, answer the following, and *then* I'll tell you why your newly claimed definition also doesn't work.
1. do you agree with this sentence: "Bitcoin was founded on **distinctly Republican** principles including limited government, less central planning and central control, and more free market principles." ?
2. Why did you quote one definition, the later say you are using a different one?
3. Why do you keep bringing Bitcoin into the discussion despite repeated statements I don't care?
4. Why do you claim I wrote "that bitcoin and libertarianism are not tied together"? Can you link to it?

You can paint a picture if you like. 


Yes, distinct from the background, as in, the set of items is {ship, background} and the *only* item in the set that has property "silhouette" is the element "ship".
Now let's look at the definition you linked:
 1. distinguished as not being the same - you fail this one since the properties you claim are "distinctly Libertarian" are shared by others
 2. different in nature or quality, "gold is distinct from iron" - again not different by the qualities listed, since they all share them.
 3. The one you used above, discredited above,
 4. distinguishing or perceiving clearly, "distinct vision" - not sure if this applies, but you're welcome to make more stuff up
 5. unquestionably exceptional or notable, also doesn't fit
Again you make my point.
It seems many people pointed out to you that your claim is wrong, so I don't think it's pedantic. You're just wrong, and have a serious inability to accept it.
Why do you feel such a need that BitCoin and Libertarianism are tied together?

Then a little reading could have saved you extensive wrangling, and removed my enjoyment seeing how far you'd keep chasing your tail.
For the record, every time you tried to get the Libertarian/Bitcoin angle, I *clearly* pointed out there is no issue there. Now you admit your mental lock on that caused to you haggle over "distinctly" this long? Quite funny.


Yep. It has been fun. Distinctly so.

Do you realize a thesaurus finds words that are similar and not identical? Did you know the word synonym means "same or **nearly** same?
I guess you ran out of using a dictionary, since it has proved you wrong so far, that you had to widen your search.


I have done nothing of the sort. I fanything, you're making BitCoiners look even more stupid (as shown all over this page) with your silly claims about "distinctly Libertarian". I'm not claiming *anything* about bitcoin designs. 
Would you say "two eyes" is a "distinctly American Trait"?
Reading, how does it work?
