I have been wondering the same thing. Is this protection there only for those who purchased on the day of the IPVO? Or is it for anyone who owns a public share, independent of when it was purchased?

The new prospectus also mentions that shareholders with fewer than 1000 shares may be eligible to have the .2 BTC service fee waived.

Cash transfers are non-reversible.

posted in a thread a couple months ago that they were enrolled in the program this semester. Any news you can share?
I am very interested in the program but as a millineal with a degree in Sustainable Agriculture, I don't want to get into more debt for a second unusable degree.
My hope is that completing this degree would put me in a great position for a career at a company like Neo, BitPay, Coinbase, or any of the many companies that are likely to open over the next couple years.

Hi! I am very interested in more information about the degree program.

Is there a way to charge the merchant the transaction fee, similar to how credit cards work?
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:06:36
Yeah exactly - the credit card fee is priced into the transaction, mostly. That's why convenience stores sometimes have a "$5 minimum," for example. In this circumstance, if the merchant transaction fees were already priced into the burrito, paid for that fee as well as the $0.06 transaction fee.
Is there a way to move the transaction fee to the seller?

I think it will rise also, steadily, and for years. We are seeing some of the first wobbles. Like riding a bike. It takes a bit to get going, even with training wheels. As you're speeding up and getting more confident, you think, "hey man, I got this." Then, all of a sudden WHAM there's a curb or a squirrel or something. But you get back up and try again, and eventually you can stop focusing on learning to ride the bike, but riding the bike with a goal in mind.

Hey I've been using your website since you posted this... another great improvement would be a zoom +/- ability. Over the course of an hour or two it is sometimes interesting to see how the exchanges cross, but it becomes blurred and hard to read at the current view. It would also be nice to be able to zoom out to days or months to look at bigger trends.

It probably scares away some people who aren't used to seeing their money fluctuate so wildly. Others who enjoy the thrill of it may believe they can use the volatility to their advantage.

You're right, there was a pause and a bit of disappointment when I realized I'd need to do a few things to make a bank transfer to mt.gox. What other exchanges are there and which do you like? What kind of set up/hurdles do you need to jump to make purchases.

Is there something around here that's already made up that I could print out and give to business owners? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:16:31
This guy has no idea what he's talking about.

I'm not sure really. I've only ever used foam from a can. I have read  about straight shaving on reddit and they recommend certain things, though I can't quote them. It'd be great to come up with a good product, sell it here to get some feedback/testimonials, then send samples to blogs like The Art of Manliness to get publicity or to stores to get sales.

I've been thinking about that. Do you have any recommendations? I've seen that ASUS has a sub $300 laptop that comes with Ubuntu. How does that compare to other cheap laptops like the chromebook?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:19:40
I remember seeing this here on reddit early this year. I visited a buddy in southbay a few months back and saw the billboard. I thought, "That's pretty cool" when I saw it in person. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:04:19
Yes I thought of that. If there is malware already on your hard drive that could run without the internet, it could conceivably store some information that it could later broadcast when you're back online. I'm on a laptop though and it may be a bit difficult for me to figure out how to disconnect the hard drive on this thing.

Can you make some kind of men's shaving soap?
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:59:11
Thank you for this reply. I have read that tutorial before and found it informative.
As a follow-up for you, on bitaddress under the paper wallet tab, there is the option to BIP38 encrypt. For this you provide a passphrase. Could you explain what this is, and would your dice-roll method work here too?
How does the word entropy apply to difficult to hack passwords?

Go into the bank and ask them for your routing and account numbers.

I suspect that over time, as the user base of the bitcoin network grows, that the average (and the median) number of bitcoins held by each person will decrease. Will the people holding large amounts never sell? Will they buy more as more are mined?

It would be nice to have the axis labeled. Looks good!
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:01:11
That is pretty slick. This is the first time I've seen that. Thanks for the link! I won't be making enough paper wallets to be able to justify spending the money on one though.
