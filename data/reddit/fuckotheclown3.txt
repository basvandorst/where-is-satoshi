Absolutely there is a pattern, but it's logarithmic horizontally. We have at least a year left, maybe more, before we see another vertically logarithmic jump. Each peak gets further from the last.

If I were a grocery store manager I'd look at the transaction limit on Bitcoin and decide it wasn't worth pursuing. It's handicapped. It will not be truly useful until we unlock the chains holding it back.
When that does happen, it will become the global reserve currency very quickly.
Running a true full node will become disincentivized pretty quickly, but some people will still do it because history has value. Running a validating node is almost as useful and regardless of block size, it's not going to get out-of-hand any time soon.

I can see people have a long way to go before they really understand the value proposition...
You could store a bitcoin wallet inside a truecrypt volume, copy the file to a google drive, put another copy on a dropbox, and another one as an email attachment in a hotmail account, and go anywhere on Earth. Nobody knows your Bitcoin wallet exists, much less how much money is in it, and you can access it from anywhere there's internet and a trustworthy computer or smart phone. As long as you have the **public** key handy, you can load your wallet up without even downloading it or decrypting it. Walking across a national border is just the tip of the iceberg. This could also be a hidden asset in a divorce, bankruptcy, mugging, etc.
The short of it is that you can create a dividing line between yourself and poverty that nobody can ever take from you, as long as you can come up with an unguessable secret passphrase, and keep your mouth shut.

I think the statement is very realistic. A lot of people don't realize how insignificant the cost of running the network would be if the price-per-unit went this high: I could build a full node that could store 30 terabytes and host it in Kansas City on Google Fiber, if bitcoin even went to, say, $3k. Think of what an enthusiast, let alone a financial institution, could do if it went to $1 million.
We're all just stuck in a limited mode of thinking right now because the network is still in chains. I say remove the block cap altogether and let bitcoin fly.

Bitcoin doesn't have high utility because we need to remove the max block size altogether and see it for what it is. Until we do, it's just a damn experiment and wager.

Node operators, just install Bitcoinxt and move on. The limit wasn't supposed to stay in place anyway.
Any modification to the basic structure of Bitcoin aside from just removing that block size cap is going to cost all its stakeholders dearly anyway. It's becoming more and more obvious that any diversion from that simple truth is an attempt to stall progress and give the banks time to attempt to come up with something better. The idea of selling out is a false dichotomy anyway. We're all rich as fuck if we can solve this relatively simple technology problem (or if the internet/storage tech beneath the problem progresses quickly enough that we don't need to).

It'd be nice to feed a server API a mycelium-compatible pass phrase and have it start churning out only public keys as QR codes. Then the business owner could just have the same pass phrase on their phone and start spending Bitcoin as fast as they're taking it in. I realize there's more to it than this, but the simpler it is, the more likely adoption will occur. As long as the API algorithm is identical to the mycelium app algorithm, I can't think of why it wouldn't work seamlessly. Mycelium doesn't know or care why it got paid.
If I ever get an abundance of free time (not likely in the near future), maybe I'll tackle this.

Still not quite right, but you did open my eyes a bit:
Total transactions right now: 68,087,066  
Blockchain size: 33196MB  
That's 2051 transactions per 10-minute block (I assumed 10 minutes, feel free to correct if necessary).
I came up with 3.4 TPS using the most empirical data available, excluding my questionable assumption about average block time.
So we'd be looking at 52MB blocks rather than 35MB blocks to cover all of Walmart's transactions. Like I said though, filling a 6TB drive every two years with Bitcoin transactions would not pose much of a challenge to the plethora of enthusiasts who already have a demonstrable interest in keeping the network running without corporate backing.

Solve the transaction problem using this rule:
The objectively least intrusive way to solve the most pressing problem (presently the number of transactions-per-unit of time is too small) should be pushed to the git repo in a way that all clients have at least 12 months, or 3 months in an emergency (as defined by reduced functionality of the end user experience), to upgrade their Bitcoin backbone software.
Once that's done, it'll be hard for current detractors to claim that Bitcoin isn't the future of the global economy. The name of the game is eliminating people's excuses not to use it.

How many of those 15 million transactions a day are cash? Also, check your math: 35MB blocks would hold 35x as many transactions as right now. At 7TPS for 1MB blocks, I came up with:
7 * 35 * 60 * 60 * 24 = **21,168,000** transactions-per-day
That would handle all of Walmart's 15 million per day as quoted by you, with plenty of room for, say, McDonalds as well. Not to mention that it's not like people are just going to flip over one single day. Presumably there would be time to refactor Bitcoin several times while people transitioned away from credit cards, and then much more slowly, cash. I don't see the mantra "A good problem to have" floated around much these days, but it's one we should all get used to. As in:
*When your full node is consuming several hundred megabytes a day, that's a problem, but it's a good problem to have.*

Anecdotally, no.
I run a full node and have for over a year. Holding on to even several TB of data that I don't need to run regular backups on is not an intimidating proposition. Once we get past a 4TB block chain, it'll get more challenging (I'd have to run server-class hardware instead of Desktop). Still doable, and my BTC better be worth enough by that point that I can afford a decent Power Edge or Proliant.

Huge props to Patrick Byrne - Overstock was the first "legitimate" company to accept Bitcoin. He didn't just propel it, he duct-taped a JATO unit on to it and lit the revolutionary fuse.

There would probably be a population who got vaccinated and a population that didn't.

Either roll with Fangolo, or realize that encryption is not fundamental, and your https:// connection to Reddit has undergone at least 5 different revisions because each previous one was insecure or didn't let them host multiple SSL sites on a single IP address. That's why it's a bad idea to roll an encryption standard in to a fundamental implementation like TCP/IP.
The concept of encrypting something is simple. The actual implementation doesn't have to be. Also, making things *unnecessarily* complex is entirely different from making them complex. The Core devs are doing the former.
A 4TB hard drive can hold almost 2 years worth of transactions **if we were running at VISA's current capacity**. A 4TB drive costs $120. If you're holding a Bitcoin and running a full node, how many years of running VISA do you think that single bitcoin could buy you?

When new tech like this comes out, a lot of people see the next hurdle and assume it won't be overcome. I've worked in startup companies and watched many seemingly impossible tech challenges dealt with in ingenious creative ways, because they were there.

1. Create a wallet in a truecrypt, document the public key... publicly. Important: Never write it to disk unencrypted. If you did, then copied it to a Truecrypt, start over.  
2. Make sure you pick a long password (like 40 characters) but something you'll never forget. Something that isn't a pattern or a dictionary word or phrase. Something that you know but has never been written. This step might be hard for a lot of people, but reach way down in your memory. You'll find some garbage data to use. Stuff from your childhood that nobody else would know, like if someone claimed to be a time traveller and you needed to test them.  
3. Write it not once, not twice, but 100 times (as different file names) to several USB drives.  
4. Write it to your laptop, to your dropbox, to your friends' hard drives, post it to imgur as a new meme. Don't just keep one copy!  
5. Deposit to the public key in large chunks (so you're not using the same output a million times).

I'll ask for a source on this, and if it's true, we really are holding on to tulip bulbs and I'll be unloading my coins and shutting down my full node as well. We've now been saying for years that Bitcoin is either worth nothing or a whole lot more than it's going for now.
If it's only "true" because the number of full nodes would be reduced, as I've actually been reading, then you need to recognize that people have sunk many millions of dollars (probably a couple billion) and the money needed for Bandwidth upgrades from the community would absolutely happen if given the chance.

After the block reward halves in July, there's going to be a run-up in price and a new wave of adoption like we won't see again for another 3 years. Ultimately, this is going to result in one of two outcomes: 1. The network runs out of capacity artificially, and your transactions fail, or 2. The network runs out of real, physical capacity, and people go out and spend some money to upgrade the Bitcoin network, as I personally have already done, to fix this real, non-abstracted problem. We've seen how the latter plays out with mining/securing the network, and now we have a fucking petahash (18 zeroes, bitch. Just so you understand, that's 60 million hashes for **every star in the galaxy** every second of every day) supercomputer working for us 3 years after we started. This isn't just a damn hobby any more. It creates wealth and people will pay to keep it running as long as the perception is that it will have value in the future.


Yes. At the very least it needs to leave people with the lasting impression that it can replace credit cards.


No, that's a symptom. The only root problem we have right now is dwindling block chain capacity due to an artificial capacity limit. There's going to be another bubble in July due to the halvening. A new adoption wave will occur, this one might be the big one, and when people can't spend their newly purchased bitcoins because the network is broke, there's going to be a big, predictable crash at the end, followed by a ton of negative press that might end cryptocurrencies. I don't want to see that happen because I'm pretty libertarian.


BitcoinXT wasn't rushed, and it's a fine product available right now. It solves this problem the correct way. I don't even get why moving transactions off-chain is part of the project goal. That's something people would just figure out how to do beyond the scope of core if and when they need it. In fact, the biggest problem with it is that it doesn't remove the cap altogether. You don't need Bitcoin to move transactions off-chain. That can be done with Litecoin or cash.

Dude, you're missing the point entirely. Once it's scaled to that size, running a node that consumes gigabytes of data per day and light up intra-data center fiber optic cables with terabytes of transactions will be a *privilege* enjoyed by those wanting priority access to **the fundamental unit of ownership recognized globally as the most neutral form of capitalism humanity can ever hope to achieve**.
If it hits that scale, the problems you're sweating right now become the kind of problems that data center operators like me have been easily handling for decades. I don't fear critical mass. I fear that Bitcoin is in the hands of people who don't know what they're sitting on, and we're going to fuck it up before it ever gets there.

Gee, let's do everything we can to keep as many nodes online as possible regardless of cost to the future of the whole institution, but then when we stumble across someone who's actually doing the job, be sure to shit on him.

You must be new to Bitcoin. This *will* happen, and people will bitch that the price is $1500 after the crash. Just a matter of time.
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:37:03
Except that a DoS in this case actually costs the "hacker" a lot of money, and drives up the price of Bitcoin. If someone wants to flood the network with valid transactions, and you want to claim that their transactions are less valid, then you've just undermined the fungible nature of Bitcoin.
If anything, I'd say give nodes the option to drop 0 fee transactions if they get too full, and make sure clients show a little warning indicator when a transaction has no fee, just like they now show when it doesn't have 6 confirms. So a 0 fee, 0 confirm transaction will light up your client like a christmas tree and you'll know to take a picture of the guy before he walks out of your coffee shop.
Then maybe full nodes could also be queried for how many transactions they're storing, so clients can know when there's a lull in the network and 0 fee transactions are fine. The only guarantee is, and has been, 6 confirms anyway, and up until the block size limit debate, that was considered just fine.
@_date: 2016-01-06 05:14:30
Do the math. I'm talking about storing the same number of transactions on the Bitcoin block chain. It's like 2.2 TB per year, roughly.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:52:24
Bandwidth can be scaled up. We're talking about things that cost money, but who would run a full node and not be interested in jacking the price of Bitcoin by scaling it up, thereby having... you guessed it: more money to spend on Internet.

It's sound logic.


What's the correct number of nodes? Because if you subscribe to that bullshit, it'll be zero once confidence in Bitcoin goes away because the network can't perform. Most people bought in with zero awareness of the block size limit.

With all due respect, this is an idiotic view. Bitcoin is open source and can always be improved while keeping the same block chain. Trying to swap it out for a different branding of the same concept with a different block chain would very publicly set the precedent that cryptos in general were unreliable stores of value.
At the end of the day, we're talking about faith and why people put theirs where they put it. That's all money is, really.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:28:41
You're missing the point that it is currently not unreasonable to expect Bitcoin to handle current VISA-level volume on chain right now today. We're 1/50th of the way there. Yes, it is less efficient by some measures, but we're talking about a scale up of about 60x and right now Bitcoin is barely taxing **one** of my four cores, 2GB tops, of my 40GB of RAM, and 62GB-ish of my 12TB. This is all running on my residential internet, and costing me $50/month, which is shared with, of course, my Internet browsing.
Some people can't handle full nodes with that kind of capacity, but literally the only reason we're humoring them is because before we had a capacity problem, these users were running full nodes, and the expectation has been set.
Making this a debate is killing Bitcoin. I have yet to see a practical use case for the blockchain without the expectation that we're scaling it to global, trustless and universal.
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:28:29
You shouldn't try to fix cultural problems in software or legislation.
0 fee transactions are fine, but if I were a retailer, I'd be asking my Bitcoin client developer to flag those somehow (maybe highlight them yellow with an exclamation mark), so I knew someone might be trying to stiff me by submitting a no fee tx during the super bowl.
At least Steve's bar tender will get to know that Steve is the kind of cheapskate that doesn't care if his payments work, and if the number of transactions drops to well below what the market can bear, maybe (scumbag) Steve is ok to not pay a fee for a few months.

We needed the max block size increased, whether the core devs acknowledge it or not, and guess what the net outcome of his rant was?
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:43:42
How about removing the limit altogether and having Bitcoin client developers put a **BIG FAT CLIENT WARNING: SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF TRANSACTION FAILURE. PLEASE WAIT WHILE WE PROCESS THIS TRANSACTION** on 0-conf, low fee transactions when the mempool exceeds a certain threshold, and base a "standard" transaction fee, ALSO UNCAPPED, on how full the mempool is, but with a **BIG FAT CLIENT WARNING: THE NETWORK IS VERY BUSY AND THE TRANSACTION FEE IS CURRENTLY X. ARE YOU SURE?** if it exceeds 25 cents.
All transactions are valid. If we want to treat some as spam just because someone's trying to DDoS the network, there goes our fungibility and credibility. Under these rules, if someone tries to DDoS, they are going to pay for it, and we don't need to tune anything in a hard fork down the road. Miners could make a small fortune watching banks and governments spend themselves in to the ground trying to keep transactions too pricey for every day users. The miners would then be able to afford the fees to unload Bitcoin for $, should they choose to.
Full node operators, now paying more to host this service, can charge for premium query access, or maybe it's just in their best interest to foot the bill (e.g. Maybe the FBI needs a full node to query against without being tracked, or Chase Bank needs to run a million queries against the blockchain, so they just host)
Some engineers don't think too far in to user behavior, and how important it is for a good experience and wide adoption. We don't have to mandate some parameters in to the concensus equation. Some parts of Bitcoin are meant to be cultural, not software-mandated. In fact, only the concept of trustless transactions should be mandated in to concensus. The block-size limit doesn't belong, nor do full nodes that don't have capacity for what the network should be right now.
The point is, we're not even addressing the problems that the correct route (the one I just described) leads to. Problems which are entirely addressable once we take Bitcoin's handcuffs off.

It is that simple. The limit was put in to prevent spam. We have transaction fees with real world cost, making all spam transactions that attach a fee legitimate. If you had to buy stamps for emails, spam would be a non-issue there. Remove the cap. If you run a full node and have bandwidth issues, throttle the number of concurrent connections. Maybe useful bandwidth throttling was the correct answer, but the core devs seem to have skipped over that completely. They already created a partition for full validation versus trimmed nodes, as though they knew what this was supposed to look like, but stopped short of the holy grail of blockchain continuity.
Can your next reply not be 3 paragraphs trying to discredit me for disagreeing? It's tiresome to read through all that just to get to your actual point.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:50:15
Let me get this straight: You have enough interest to run a full node, but you'd rather run it where it can't scale? Note that you can limit the number of peers...
Not to mention the possibility of maybe paying for premium internet when your Bitcoin goes to $100k each because it's suddenly globally useful.

What is this complicated shit?
Simplicity is the fucking key to any widely used system. How many of you are using IPv6 right now? Thought not.
The people who game simple systems are easily identified and caught, a must have for a successful replacement for the existing, grossly overcomplex financial system.
I like the idea that my 8 year old can tell if someone might scam him out of his bitcoins and explain, in a single sentence how the scammer did it, to another 8 year old.
If Core really introduces all this extra shit rather than deal with extra disk space and bandwidth, they'll kill the whole thing. I think that's what they fucking want though.
If I knew this was the future of Bitcoin, I never would have bought in. We just need to deal with the fact that it's going to use an exorbitant amount of disk space (not a big problem these days) and get over it. Remember the hangup we all had that mining was going to use more electricity than (insert some ridiculous comparison) yet GPU mining was developed, ASICs were developed, high efficiency small ASICs were developed, and now we literally have data centers spread around the planet dedicted to Bitcoin network security? That's how it's supposed to fucking scale. Not by creating complex shit that can break and is hard to understand. If you guys manage to put all this shit in to Bitcoin and it somehow doesn't fail, not 5 years will go by before people invent "High capacity bitcoin nodes" that are this revolutionary new Bitcoin concept that makes it "simpler and easier". I guarantee that.
Save us all some pain and make disk usage and bandwidth the fucking problem. The world is ready to deal with that problem. The bitcoin community has demonstrated that we'll erect fucking data centers to solve these easy problems.
And I like how I can't even name drop an implementation that already supports this without getting fucking banned from the subreddit (I just got unbanned after 3 days). Yeah, there is nothing to see here. I think I know who the real scammers are, and they're not trying to steal your bitcoins. Just their value.

It's not supposed to be safe. It's supposed to be useful. Think of a credit card auth for $4 at Taco Bell - they don't make you sign anything, because the odds of you being dishonest and not fearing prosecution (pretty much every cash register on the planet has video surveillance) are outweighed by the convenience of moving the line. Some problems are meant to be fixed in culture, not software.
I'm a little pissed because now I need to know what RBF is before I can use Bitcoin safely. It's obvious to me what the core devs are doing, and it's either incompetence or maliciousness, because these shitty new features, while perhaps useful under some circumstances, are sucking up valuable time to do the hard fork we need to do. They would probably be better implemented as a "warning: low or no fee transaction" that comes up in the client of the vendor accepting payment. They could then gauge the risk and make the asshole buyer wait 10 minutes. Maybe a warning in your wallet of choice if you opt for low or no fee that says: "Warning: Network traffic is fairly high right now and there's a significant chance you didn't pay a large enough fee for this to go through. OK/Cancel?" The underlying functionality was fine before, and they just fixed a problem they're creating by not just upping the damn block size limit in the first place.
Also, people equating a hard fork to an altcoin need to get a grip - Altcoins are premined, separate block chains. This would be the same chain but a little closer to what most stakeholders envisioned in the first place, and nudging us toward replacing Visa, which we need to just suck up and realize is essential for this currency to move past the "experiment" phase.
Why are we arbitrarily now deciding the "correct" number of full nodes? Maybe people in the country-side on satellite internet connections or 2400 baud just aren't cutting the mustard. I wouldn't try to host an FTP server on such a connection. Why do we expect full nodes to run on it? So what if the number running is 5000 or 2500? They have a job to do and if they don't have the resources, they don't have the resources. 10000 nodes running crippleware is not fucking better.

That said, they are definitely crappy and I'd never host 4TB of data I cared about on a single Seagate.

Ok I'll help you out: Digital currency has existed for decades. There's nothing special about it. There is something special about trustless. I assume you already know both of those, but haven't connected the dots: In order to make it trustless, you need a public ledger with essentially a public auction with public rules where the winner gets to decide the sequence of publicly declared events. Essentially something so fair that nobody even has a chance to bitch. That was Satoshi's contribution to human kind. Now the reason I said it's all or nothing is because the **only** value in making all that public is because you're interested in laying down any pretense of control over the economy and furthering perfect trust with peers (nothing more, nothing less) sharing the system. Correct me if I'm wrong.
As soon as another cryptocurrency comes along and it undermines the concept of perfect trustworthiness, it becomes its own Achilles heel. Citi should just stick with their already developed systems. There's no room in a trustless system for a controlling entity.

3. You aren't shallow.

Don't feed the trolls. Also, altcoins are bad. Bitcoin is open source and the problems it has can be fixed in source. Altcoins leech on the success of bitcoin and don't even do a good job of it. Their authors, in every case, have just copied the open source Bitcoin, changed a few things, and premined.

If it fails, it establishes a precedent of failure. Have you considered that with your open mind? Would you trust the next altcoin, knowing it was just a matter of time before its replacement came along, whether or not you were paying attention to the price?
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:10:05
The altcoins are only there to dilute Bitcoin's value. I know some people who would mine them (or even start coins) then trade on Cryptsy back-and-forth with Bitcoin.
The most persuasive alt-coin argument I ever saw was when the Litecoin guy said he was charging a fee on multiple outputs to prevent a spamming problem. I thought that was cool until I realized it was double-taxation on a transaction (Every one of them presumably got dinged when it became a viable input) and would actually piss me off as a consumer.
Altcoins had to happen, but fuck them. All of them.

Did your mom beat you again?
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:14:27
I'll try to be brief. It's inevitable.
A blockchain has only one practical use: A global, trustless ledger. For any other purpose you can devise, it's worthless.
This creates the problem of copycat global trustless ledgers, and which one to trust. Piece of cake: It can be assumed that if there are flaws in the original that are fixed in the copycat, that the temptation to move to the copycat will be stifled by your newfound lack of confidence in the original, since the same thing could just happen again. Bitcoin addresses this by being open source. The software can change, and as long as the blockchain is intact, it's still worthy of the confidence of its constituents. If it's not Bitcoin, it's nothing, due to the precedent that failure would set.
Could it fail? No. It's open source software running all over the globe. It's more worthy of confidence than the US election system, which runs on closed source machines, and the fiat dollar system (robbing you blind especially if you don't know what I'm talking about)
Why switch from dollars to Bitcoin? There are many well documented flaws in fiat currency, and it comes down to a matter of which currency is more deserving of its constituents' confidence. In 2015, the market indicators like the dow are at all-time highs, yet the prime interest rate seems to keep finding excuses to stay near zero, the US debt-to-GDP is about 100%, and everyone is watching and waiting for that first domino to fall.

My point wasn't that Bitcoin is definitely the future. It was that I wouldn't be looking to diversify your crypto risk in to alt coins - Shares of Berkshire Hathaway might be a better hedge. If Bitcoin is a dead-end, so are the alt coins, and for the same (as of yet unidenfied) reason. The whole concept of currency is based on faith, and the whole allure of Bitcoin is that it's worth putting faith in to for many reasons.

Think of it this way: We have steamshovels and telescopes and submarines and jets, all of the information that's available we can get. However, there are only so many human minds available to process it. So they have to pick and choose what they look for. Why, the NSA is not even checking their own speedometer when they drive down the express way - a clear violation of the law. They're not looking at the fourth amendment, written in such a way that anyone can see what it's for, and thinking about that when they wiretap your phone calls.
Their minds are restricted to patterns where people are clearly trying to do something they shouldn't be doing. They're only human. Lots of seemingly naive people use that to their advantage regularly, and you've probably never even noticed.

Please switch. We're about two months past when we needed concensus on this, and I wouldn't be surprised if vendors stopped offering Bitcoin soon as a payment option due to problems with transactions. Someone on this board seems to really want that.
Look at the whole situation in hindsight - all we needed was the block size limit increased, and *somehow* an implementation doing exactly that while preserving the continuity of the blockchain (the important part) is getting trashed and censored. Block limits can be enforced much more easily than they can be lifted. There's no such thing as a bitcoin authority. This one is on you and me as node operators.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:41:22
Not picking a fight. Can you describe how I'd lose them if I'm holding the private keys for any public keys I'm working with? I definitely don't want to lose cash, but I don't believe you. Conventional habits don't apply to this wallet and I believe I know the risks. Upvote is for indulging me.
Lets say I pick a single public key and only beam whole BTC to it (which I accumulate very, very slowly). I also back the encrypted wallet up in a geographically diverse way several times over, and I've rehearsed the incredibly long passphrase enough temporally distant times to be sure my confidant and I won't forget it.

Use  to generate a BIP38 encrypted (there's a checkbox on the print front screen) address, come up with a killer 40+ character password for it, never write the password down but make sure you can remember it, make a bunch of duplicates of the QR codes and keep them geographically diverse so you don't lose them to, say, a fire, and go to town! All you'll need is the public key to add money and one of your many copies of the private key QR code and the password you memorized to retrieve it.
If you press F12 in Chrome or Firefox, you can confirm that the bitcoinpaperwallet code isn't sending your private keys to the internet. If it does, don't use it (it doesn't).
Make sure you use a legit client like Mycelium to do withdraws from it, because there is a slight chance if you do a partial withdraw, from a client that doesn't form the transaction correctly, that you'll send the rest of the balance to an address to an unknown address.
I've personally confirmed that Mycelium's Cold Storage option will handle these withdraws correctly.
There's other... mythology floating around here that reusing addresses is bad. I've been paying attention, and the practical answer is that it's not. I really wish some cryptography expert would lay in to me with some cold facts about how I'm wrong, but so far everyone's been repeating the same rumors and citing the same vague sources about address reuse.

Think of the Bitcoin software like the linux kernel. It's free, open source software that gets patched as needed. It's been around a long time and alternatives like Windows have looked dirty in comparison for years now, and resort to marketing tactics to keep their foot in the door.
The blockchain, however, is a very real invention. Hell yes it's the final evolution. If the bitcoin blockchain, created in 2009, the very embodiment of trustless global transactions, the only reason cryptocurrencies are a thing, got dropped in favor of something else somehow, think about the precedent that would set for crypto in general. It can't happen. Quit posting that it can, because you're either stupid or lying.

Hmmm ok so I had one at Netsol and I transferred it to Godaddy for like 5 years. I don't remember the cost, but it was between $6-$9 per year. When it's nearing expiration, I'll look at options again. I don't give these companies any loyalty, and conversely, I don't give them any shit. I just want my domain name for cheap and for a long time.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:02:40
Ironically, I picked them only because they're extremely competitive on price. The only argument you've made that I really care about is wrong.
Anyway, I usually wait till my domain is going to expire, then switch to a competing registrar - they usually give you a break if they feel like they're stealing a customer. Everyone's happy (except the previous registrar).

Affordable? As the network grows, it will make sense to spend more money on it. A full node with 50MB blocks might cost $50k a year to run, but every financial on the planet would want their own so their competitors couldn't query-limit them or some other nonsense. I pulled those numbers out of my butt, but you get the idea.

Actually, I think calling people on bullshit is probably one of the most useful functions we can serve on a message board. Probably second only to fact itself.
But see, the second you elaborate on why something is bullshit, you're giving Trolly T. Trollerson an opening to spew more of it. You'll run out of facts faster long before they lose the ability to synthesize fresh steaming horseshit on-the-fly, so it's best just to say they're full of shit and move on. It's like debating a religious person or a partisan. Don't bother. Just call their belief bullshit, because they didn't form their opinion rationally.
I wish more people realized this, especially here.

Well, specifically people handing him a cell phone with a virtual gift card on it. I'm not sure how else Gyft is incentivizing themselves, but for Bitcoiners, we get an effective 3% discount in the form of some stupid point system they use. Of course if you time your bitcoin buys and cash-outs well, that discount gets increased.

Step aside, boy and indulge in your little authoritarian fantasy somewhere else. The grownups are talking. Let Fucko teach you how to apply pressure to get what you want. Bitcoin is not your idol to be a slave to. In fact, I'm going to use my stakes to ensure that it's the opposite.
You need a re-education, boy. Your presuppositions about Bitcoin are going to land it exactly where you don't even realize you don't want it to go. You only get 80 years of free will. Use it or lose it. It's not a lot.
There is no bitcoin god, boy. If you create one, that's on you. I'll still be here when the disillusionment comes.

Consider this: each BIP is adopted by various nodes. Now they all accept large blocks. The network adjusts and we see Visa levels of traffic. The forks that don't work go the way of the dodo.
I'm sure that's a gross oversimplification, but this locomotive isn't getting derailed, and in the end my statement will prove true.

Curious: In practice, lets say my friend and I are at Subway and I need to borrow 1 bitcoin to buy my sub. So he shoots it to my phone, and it instantly arrives. Can I then buy my sub, or do I have to wait 1-10 minutes for a confirmation?
I guess they could both go in to the same block? I always assumed you had to wait for a confirm to spend it, but does the miner just confirm both at once?

I didn't think we still used "tech savvy" to describe the basic knowledge that if you don't back up your data, it is at a very high risk of loss.

I ran a node for a couple years and stopped because I couldn't sync the block chain and I thought there was a problem with bitcoind, and I kept updating it, hoping that **this** would be the release that fixed this sync "bug". Turns out I have bad RAM in my server, which is what people here kept suggesting (thanks, people here). Incidentally, every other app I run on that server runs like a champion for years on end. I wonder if there's a way to make bitcoind more resilient, but I realize I'm the exception, not the rule. On the other hand, this may come up again and I can't help but wonder if a node with bad RAM can infect other nodes by giving bad checksums, etc.
I ordered some new RAM and should have my node back online by next week.
I run it because I don't think it's fair that I spent 30+ years of my youth not knowing that I was hooked on dirty liar money before I finally understood it and got on a level playing field with bankers, politicians, and economists. I don't want my kids (ok maybe grandkids at this point) to have that built-in disadvantage.

The incentive is that you can know your balance for sure or make a transaction for sure, and you're not dependent on someone else to do it.

I ran that Andreas Schildebach(?) Bitcoin wallet for a while. Mycelium blows it away. First of all, with the former, you have to periodically back up. With the latter, you back up once right after installation and restoring is a piece of cake. Don't get me started on restoring Bitcoin wallet.
Second, Mycelium supports funky stuff like withdrawing a small amount of a cold wallet. That's stuff you really have to be in to Bitcoin to appreciate, and they cater to you when (not if) you get to that point. That's stuff that says you can't (or shouldn't) do, yet it's supported and works perfectly. Frankly, I think he's wrong, going on old information or a lack of understanding. I mention him by name so he can defend himself against my little tirade.
USE MYCELIUM.

Most wallets don't, because full nodes typically provide a free service, but ownership of one would protect against a future where people start locking them down.

Why are you getting upvotes? The software does this by posting giant warnings when you haven't created a backup, which is a concept that, in 2015, my elderly mother even understands and doesn't need to be told.


Are you sure you understand the fundamental nature of being your own bank? This is a cultural problem, not a software problem. The OP was stupid to ignore the warnings. Failure to "secure people's money" would be if Mycelium's randomizer was predictable, or it automatically backed up their seed to the iCloud in plain text.

This same problem also killed my interest / ability to maintain a full node. I haven't been able to get an initial sync of the block chain to work in over a year. I've been assured that 4GB of RAM was plenty and that maybe my machine has bad RAM, but it runs other applications indefinitely. That's scary.
