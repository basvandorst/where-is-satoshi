I understand that it is highly unlikely that I'll be able to mine bitcoins on my own. What are the other alternatives to earn bitcoins
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:17:11
It was a pretty amateurish attempt, if you're still interested I could send it to you on your email. Pm me.
Could you elaborate on the localbitcoins part?

What would be a good conversion rate to buy?

I usually do dollar cost averaging and buy ethereum and Bitcoin, now with the introduction of BCash, I'm not sure how to go about it anymore

Bear market for BTC or alts? 
Regarding alts do you suggest go with the top 5-6 alts based on market cap or go a bit riskier and diversify them as well

cex.io, I  use them and the transactions are instant.
Do let me know what you decide on, I'm always looking out for better alternatives (ireland here)

I thought Segwit was supposed to introduce the Lightning network and sidechains. Wasnt Segwit2x supposed to increase the block size from 1mb to 2mb?

Which are the alts you would consider buying into? Ethereum, XRP?

How secure is Mycelium? I keep btc on my phone and take the master seed backup and note it down on an actual paper sheet. What else can I do to secure my btc? 
What if my phone dies abruptly? Do I just buy a new phone, install mycelium and load using the master backup?
Trezor or Ledger aren't available in my country
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:29:40
Makes sense, I'll consider buying a trezor. Will have to figure out how to though, they don't sell it in my country
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:34:45
They do sell international, but the shipping charges are about 30% of the actual product. That stings a bit.
Will have some friends/family travelling from the US/Europe to get it with them. Which would you suggest though? I see that Trezor and Ledger Nano S are the most recommended and the Ledger is cheaper than the Trezor.

Thanks for the advice so far, much appreciated.
I had invested a decent figure in btc when it was in ~720 price range and am happy to see the current rise in price. Have some cash lying around for this purpose, will wait to see how far this price rise continues before investing some more, plan to do a small fraction of my pay every month. The ledger/trezor will be required as I continue on this path

A noob question : 
1) What does it mean by setting up a full node?
2) What are the uses/advantages in doing so
3) Why is it so difficult to do so?
4) How would one go about setting up a full node?
@_date: 2016-12-14 03:27:58
Thank you for the quick reply :)

Could you elaborate more on the '0-days for phones' aspect. I tried googling the phrase but most of the articles were going overhead-transmission
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:01:53
What about Mycelium? How secure is keeping your bitcoins on your phone + keeping the seed backup on an actual paper ?
