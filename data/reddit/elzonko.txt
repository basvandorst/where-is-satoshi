What made you want to get onto the exchange in the first place? Just curious, because I thought about it myself for some time, but I was too paranoid to hand over any information.

There seems to be a fair amount of criticism of the mining rig idea.  But it might be an interesting project to create a Bitcoin (or altcoin) clone that would function as the class's own private Bitcoin network, and have students set up their own miners, wallets etc. for that network.  Then you can control all parameters of the network/code to tailor to class goals.

"I find it exceedingly hard to believe a journalist can be that.. incompetent"
What? Really? Do you ever read the news?
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:41:21
yes, use broken crypto to secure a proof of anything, and tell us how that went for you in five years.

I don't worry about them.  I wonder about them.

Uh, no, I'm not.  I never said "Bitcoin stole from people."  I'm asking what would make anyone think it was safe to hand over complete control of so much of their coin to a shoddy website.  The whole point of Bitcoin is that it is a trustless system.  Taking your coin and trusting it to a third party in this manner completely undermines your own security.  


Yeah, again, the point of Bitcoin is that it is a trustless system.  I'm saying I don't get why anyone would then undermine their own security by going back and trusting random people they don't know with complete control of their coin.  


You suck your father's dick with that mouth?! You should be ashamed, you scum sucking piece of garbage!


And you are a piece of gutter trash.

If someone got their bitcoins at $100 a piece, and today buys something that costs $100, they will have gotten a significant discount.

Day trading with your retirement fund or the down payment for your house or all of your savings?  I think there is likely another word for that, day traders I know wouldn't call that day trading.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:29:06
It depends on the state, but yes, in many states this is the case.  iirc, there are about 5 million people who are disenfranchised by this policy.

The SHA family is definitely the way to go.  No reason to use md5 rather than a SHA.

Arguably, we already have state anarchy, since government agencies and their agents violate the law with impunity.  
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:35:34
Read the Satoshi white paper: 
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:52:14
There are definitely some interesting conspiracy angles to Bitcoin. You might also add the fact that all SHA functions were developed by the NSA. 
On the other hand, the Bitcoin protocol could also be used to control government itself. Imagine implementing a blockchain to track all expenditures in a government agency.

I thought it would be interesting to use it to buy things online, but then again I never really buy anything online anyway.

lol, wow you're even dumber than I first assumed.  Your impotent rage is rather amusing, but your  ignorance is tedious at best and your trolling skills are sub-par.  So, troll harder cocksucker! Better luck next time.

That's 5 more than most journalists and reporters require.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:22:17
And if you buy something for .1 BTC that costs $100, but you bought that .1 BTC for $1?
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:01:05
But was it because you wanted to do serious day trading? or just casual buying and selling?  
Was local in-person buying and selling not an option?

You think it's that high?

Stop in at the NYC Bitcoin Center down on Broad Street.  You can find tons of people from the NYC BTC scene there who may be able to help you out.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:21:42
My hunch was along those lines too, but I still don't really get the thought and decision making process.
Ignorance. What would make people think they were made "safer" by handing over a bunch of personal/private information and control of their cash and coin to a website with a history of serious problems?  That is the very definition of unsafe.  How could people not know that they could store coin on their own wallet?! 
Laziness. How is it more convenient to store your BTC at an online exchange than on your own machine?
Greed.  If you couldn't get your money out, then the greed argument doesn't work either!
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:15:18
You should not be using md5 for anything like this.  It is considered [severely compromised](

I'd be interested to know why anyone would downvote a factual point about the security of a hashing algorithm.

"Is there a "this asshole twisted my words" blacklist for journalists?"
Yes. It's called the employee rolls of the mainstream media.

I was under the impression that arbitrage was not really feasible because it was so difficult to get money out of Gox.

@_date: 2014-08-09 20:58:14
Yeah, that's my point, the professional criminals in the political and corporate classes along with the police gangs and law enfarcement agencies sucking up tax payer money all commit crimes with impunity.  At least in Japan these assholes might have the sense of honor to kill themselves.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:05:51
That's a good point, and one I had not thought of. Along similar lines, I was just wondering how many potential scams there will be of people claiming they had cash/coin there, to try to get a refund, but in fact did not.  
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:05:06
Was thinking the same thing myself.  But the transactions don't go to the Sun Times, they are actually donations to the Taproot Foundation.  For the Sun Times, this appears to just be a test/experiment implementing a Bitcoin paywall technology and Taproot is the beneficiary.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:30:32
I'm planning on going too, but I haven't gone in a couple months, and was wondering if others were still going on the regular.  The only places I've heard it being held were at the Lincoln Statue in Union Square and at the Bitcoin Lounge Bar EVR in midtown (usually when it's too rainy to meet outside).  
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:23:24
hah, had never heard that one before.  You can lead a blind horse to water, but you can't with a wink, I guess.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:43:06
Depending on where you are, you may be able to find a Bitcoin meetup group relatively near by.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:46:08
AFAIK, people have been meeting at Union Square, so that's probably the best bet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:20:48
I think you missed the joke.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:45:23
I would say, don't ask anything about Bitcoin as a currency, or store of value, or anything related to economics.  The guy does cryptography, ask him about the underlying cryptographic schemes, how they work, how the double spend problem is solved, how or whether the cryptographic schemes of the Bitcoin protocol are demonstrably secure, or something along those lines.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:00:45
How many characters long was your passcode?  
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:05:47
But that's not actually very good practice, no? People should be in control of their own keys, and know how a wallet is set up.  Could give them a short guide on how to set up a wallet along with with a homemade bitcoin coupon or something and send them a transfer when they're ready.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:27:59
You would probably be better off trying to sell those computers or the parts from those computers in exchange for Bitcoin than using them to mine Bitcoin, or sell them for fiat and use that money to buy Bitcoin.  Heck, just yesterday I was looking to buy a used desktop for Bitcoin.

Why?  It is because the average US citizen suffers from political Stockholm Syndrome, and, no matter how much they claim to hate them, continue to identify with their hostage takers in the Democratic and Republican parties.

In his book on applied cryptography, [Bruce Schneier]( writes: "There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files."  Hiding files the way you are suggesting is akin to the former, which is often termed obscurity rather than security.  Even if you're hiding something in an obscure word file, you can still encrypt that word file, which would be more secure than leaving it in plaintext.

Why do you think Satoshi Box is the best? I've been looking into a few of them, including the other ones you mentioned.  There is so little info on them, it's making me a bit skeptical.  
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:15:47
Thanks for the info.  May I ask what you've been using it for?
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:20:53
I wonder the same thing about credit cards.  People buying things they don't need with money they don't have.

Basically it's just a meet up where people gather to trade Bitcoin.  It's local bitcoin but with a group.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:59:28
Gox is overpriced, so it's good to agree on a lower price.  Make sure you have at least one or two confirmations (or more, depending on the amount of money you're dealing with) from the network before officially closing the deal.  I've seen people make trades in person where the buyer puts the dollars on the table, and the seller initiates the BTC transaction.  And then they waited for a confirmation, after which the seller took the dollars and the buyer had his BTC, and both walked away happy.    
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:09:48
okay, maybe you are hesitant to say how many characters long it was.  But over 20? over 30? over 40?
Could you possibly be mistaking the word-based mnemonic that blockchain.info provides when you set up a wallet there with the passkey for this brain wallet?   
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:32:54
Yeah it's just trading, but also fun to meet up with other folks and talk about crypto currency (the running joke being that you have to go to the BTC meetups in NYC because all your friends who aren't interested in it are sick of hearing you talk about it).  Not sure how many people are into altcoin, you may be able to find some Litecoin people there, there have been a couple in the past.
