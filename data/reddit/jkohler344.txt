Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:10:06
But technically this is something virtual that is intangible so theoretically could you get away with it

The problem is they took$400 and gave me no btc and it's not even in my transactions on coinbase just in my bank account
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:10:47
See you get it

Just waiting on strip clubs to accept bitcoin. Then the strippers get their qr code for their wallet tattooed  on them. Here take .001 btc for a lap dance

That's actually pretty cool. My main problem though is I don't have that $400 to spare right now. So hopefully they will respond to ticket today and put the money back. When I sent the ticket it said it might be a few days though

I didn't invest this, I put in a little a few days ago, what I had extra I could afford to lose and got charged $400 by coinbase right after my paycheck went in for no apparent reason

It's 6 am right now but I don't t hi k they will be able to help me I think it's gotta be coinbase to resolve this issue.

When I bought the other day it was instant. Also I have a $200 limit a week on this card so I have no clue what happened 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:56:16
No it showed my $200 transaction instantly on Wednesday and Friday at 2am I had a $400 transaction in my bank account but didn't do anything on coinbase nor does it show more bitcoin/pending transactions
