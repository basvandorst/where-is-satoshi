They did pretty much the same thing back in 2011 after they got hacked. It took a week or so to get back online, everyone speculated that he ran off with their money, etc. This looked to be just about the same deal. Guess not.

Been in Bitcoin since mid 2010 and lost serious coin tonight. I'm sure I'll be sulking about it for a week. Whatever.
I'd like to say this, a lot of you blame Mark Karpeles for this, but I think he's not such a bad guy. Sure, he doesn't communicate well with the public, but that's always been the case since the early days, its just not something he likes to do. One thing he does like to do is the right thing. When the shit would hit the fan, he wouldn't run, he'd backup his customers and do the right thing. Just remember that there aren't a lot of people like that in the world, especially in the Bitcoin world. Go easy on him.

I find it ironic that someone in the Bitcoin market is wishing for a company to have a PR department.  One of the qualities of a PR department is to ease the public perception by hiding the true nature of what is going on inside. Often by simply lying or spinning things a certain way. Sure there are good things that come with PR too, but generally, I'd rather not have the lies. Especially in this market.

???? Now this really doesn't make any sense. If they are only meant to be collected, then why put the bitcoin on it? Bitcoin pseumatics deal with intereting block numbers, not just collecting any random coin. And usually collectable coins and money that is of the current format can still be spent.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:43:39
I somehow doubt MtGox is even worth $75 million. If they do $6 million per day in transactions (according to the article) that only works out to be about $10 million per year in fees. And that's probably a high estimate and based on the last couple months of heavy trading. If Coinlab had only a 2 year contract with them, that only comes out to $20 million. Of course, this is the United States, where you can sue for whatever amount you want over anything.

I tend to err on the side of caution as well. How easy is it to setup a ecommerce site these days and fake a story on reddit.
On the other hand, you can gain more confidence by looking at the history of Nikolai's reddit account. Sure, accounts can be bought and people can change, but you could just wait and see if others review the site. Or you could start out with a small purchase. I'm posting this comment only to try to encourage people to think a bit more and be careful so that there is generally less fraud in the BTC community.
I think he has some really cool items for sale his site though. Good luck to you Nikolai, I hope you make it.

Well, you can't exactly say that. Paypal could be described as an early form of Bitcoin because like Bitcoin, you are transfering value digitally (not credit). The big difference with Bitcoin is that its the first *non-centralized system* for transfering value over the Internet.

Its a joke, he wasn't really in the bitcoin market in 2010. If he was, he would have just run his CPU for a day and had 50-100 BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:17:09
Actually, a major reason it was worse in 2011 is because that flatline there around June 19th, 2011 was when MtGox was hacked and closed for about a week. I suspect that had a lot to do with people losing interest in it. While the overall look of the graphs may be the same, especially around the bubble. The trend over the past few months still shows an upward moving market. Or couldn't you tell that by the graph you posted? Bitcoin has a whole lot more traction, interest and adoption this year than it did in 2011.
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:31:04
He's talking about losing them as in the data is gone. There is nothing to "crack" in that case. You can't just go buying random hard drives hoping there are old bitcoin wallets on them.

Its not very clear on their website and I brought this up with the guy who runs it. If you're in the US and buy less than $1700 worth of PM they ship from Berlin and the shipping charges are higher.  If you buy over $1700 they drop ship them from APMEX.

So if you have to change your address what are you supposed to do in cases where you've sent an investment to someone anonymously and they send you coins back to that address each month? I guess I could prove to them who I am by sending them a secret amount, but is there another easier way?

What these trends often say is that Europe is a powerful force in the BTC world. Over the past several months I've seen a lot of panic buying/selling around 4am EST, which indicates morning in Europe. If you look at the news for Europe today you'll see that "French President Francois Hollande declares that the eurozone debt crisis is over". BTC is big enough now that world economic forces play a role in the price, just like in any other commodity.

And then what do you do with the silver?  See, this is why its confusing and wrong.  Bitcoin is about putting the trust of bitcoins into crypnetwork security, not physical items, which is what Casascius coins seems to try to be doing. I understand that it has this redeemable private key inside, but I think what this will lead too as the price of bitcoins increases and if Casascius coins become more common is fake physical bitcoins, where the hologram looks real enough, but its all fake. The Chinese are making fake Gold/Silver bars and coins that look very real and have even duped some regular metals dealers. So now they have to really check everything because they can't go on looks alone. If physical bitcoins get to that point, then what have you really gained? Why not just use a paper wallet or transfer them through your phone?

Its not wasting money if the difficulty goes down to 1.2 million and later the coins mined go up to 260.

I can also report that bitcoincommodoties.com is legit and works well. Have bought gold coins and silver coins and bars from them. I tested the metals to make sure they are not counterfeit using a few different cheap methods.  Its really awesome to be able to convert bitcoins directly into gold bullion and each shipment only took a week to receive. If you want to convert the metal into cash, find a reputable coin/metal dealer in your area, not one of those "buy your gold" places. They pay really awful rates like 60-70% of spot. In Cincinnati there is a place that buys gold at 2% below the spot price, which is great.

Its risk to keep the money in BTC and its risk to keep the money in USD. Life is risk, So what's the difference? Stupid risk is when you throw $5000 at Satoshidice, because you can lose it all in one play without the chance to get it back. At least with investing you have some left over and can wait for recovery.

There is a major difference though. mtgox was hacked in 2011 right after it crashed down from 30 and mtgox was closed for a week. This had a huge impact on the price. Of course, perhaps instead of the hack one could say the dwolla account freeze is something similar.
