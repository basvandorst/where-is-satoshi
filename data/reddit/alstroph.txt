Those posts are 10 months old, at that time was only a month old. He may not have even known about it then.

I was going to recommend the same. Great community.

From what I gather from that picture your password HASH will be in clear text, but your password itself will not. Still not much better since hashes can be cracked rather easily.

I actually came up with this on my own about a year ago, but I had a bit of a different vision. Users could create an identification to use as their anonymous ID. That way they could maintain the same anonymous identification without compromising their actual identification. They could post messages and confirm their ID via the bitID.

Big fucking surprise. I purchased some cryptocurrency on Cryptsy, from here on out we will refer to it as XCoin. 
XCoin was about 70% lower on Cryptsy when compared to other exchanges, so I purchased about $200 dollars worth. I then tried transferring about $1 worth out of my Cryptsy wallet into the main XCoin wallet. Never came, through some research I found out that XCoin had recently forked and Cryptsy had failed to update.
I bugged Cryptsy, eventually one of the admins told me that they did not know how to contact the XCoin devs. No problem, I knew how to do that. I put the two in contact with each other. Through this process I also landed a position working for XCoin. 
I spent the next 2 months TIRELESSLY working with Cryptsy and XCoin to help exchange old coins for new coins. Near the end of this process we discovered that Cryptsy was under-allocated by about $10,000, meaning Cryptsy owed it's users $20,000 but they only had $10,000 worth of valid coins.
What happened? After pulling their fucking teeth out I was able to get Cryptsy to agree to the exchange HOURS before the deadline. Let's note that I was in the middle of this transaction and could have intercepted it with ease, but I trusted Cryptsy at this time.
So after the transaction what happens? Nothing. They pocketed the $10k, left the old worthless version of XCoin to die on the market. The Cryptsy users were screwed out of $20k while Cryptsy was $10k richer. They took no responsibility and blamed XCoin for the problems.
Not to mention I lost $200 and 2 months of time dealing with their bullshit. Fuck Cryptsy.

I planned to sell it back to the market for a slight loss if I had to, instead I took the path of getting in too deep. Some lessons you have to learn the hard way.
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:08:52
Definitely the lesson to learn from my mistake. Even if it looks bulletproof you're probably in for more trouble than its worth

If you're  planning on getting the notebook for mining only, no. You'd be better off spending that money on a machine made for mining, and even then its going to take a long time to break even. Mining difficulty increases over time so I think you'll find that mining is a waste of time unless you have more cash to invest.

I lurked for a year before that as I was beginning my Digg transition.

I lost so much money on panic selling in the past, never again.

Sorry you're getting downvoted. I just started mining dogecoin today so I appreciate the tip!

You and I know the inherent risks, but obviously a large portion of the community does not. I'm here to make money, but I'm also here to support a decentralized non-government regulated currency (also I'm a technology enthusiast so I enjoy building miners and configuring the hell out of them.) 
You're preaching to the choir, I wrote the original post because of the panic induced frenzy that took place earlier. Watching the market swing is part of the fun, that's why I sit back and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:36:37
At least I'll never fail as hard as you.
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:04:51
I'm hoping that it's going to snowball. I remember looking at bitcoins a few years ago and thinking it wasn't going to go much further than it already had. Now I've gained interest in the system and I've been spreading the word to as many people as I can.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:05:08
I read in another post that they DDOSed Silkroad and then watched the many nodes they control to watch for traffic spikes.

The creator of this comic should really have included a QRcode instead to increase his potential donations. 
EDIT:  This is the original artist. Don't upvote this comic, take it down and repost it without the BTC address. Fucking rude to try and profit off of others art. Not blaming you op although you are a suspect.

I invested $100 into 1 bitcoin 7 or 8 months ago, turned it into 13 bitcoin with bitcoin stocks, then sold out 10 of them for a $900 dollar profit. Even though I could have made $10k if I had held and sold later I've only gained on bitcoin so far. 
I recently invested $1500 in altcoin mining hardware. While the value drop does suck (cut my USD profit per day in half) I'm not terribly worried because I'm in it for the long haul. All I really care about is stocking up on more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:23:39
If you link a bank account and verify your identity you'll be able to buy and sell more than I assume you're able to. I verified and my limits are 50BTC buying and 10BTC selling per day.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:28:47
Thanks :) Just started mining doge, very happy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:07:35
This has happened before and it will happen again. Negative news came out, people panicked, started selling. Price fell, more selling. Price will bottom out, people will start buying at new low price. Price will increase, people who sold out will panic again and buy in, price will increase more. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:30:22
Ah so it turns out this guy is an asshole trying to profit on others creation, at least allegedly.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:09:22
It was speculation, USA is asleep anyways. I'm not worried about the price until the morning/afternoon, that will paint a better picture.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:32:35
You're assuming the price is going to continue to fall.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:28:51
That worked out, thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:36:34
Thanks for the tip! I just hope that scrypt mining remains profitable throughout the crash, bitcoin will be fine.

Spam somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:28:55
Regardless I think that it's an excellent time to buy in, I don't think it will dip below $700, should be steady in 800s or higher tomorrow. Brought to you by your local bitcoin forecaster.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:29:47
I agree, I see as much bullshit at bitcointalk as I do here.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:05:36
Not really. If people want to flood the subreddit with numerous discussion threads that's fine with me. Actually, let's just discuss the fluctuations at bitcointalk.org. Good luck with that.

It's anonymous because I can set up a wallet that is not tied to me and receive coins in said wallet.

There is an Option 3 but I'm not going to talk about it. Research and think outside of the box. Hint: people are blind sighted by bitcoin.

In 6 months when the price is at $5000 (speculation!) you'll eat those words.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:18:46
I've only gained from bitcoin. About 7 months ago I bought 1 bitcoin for $100 dollar, invested in some bitcoin stocks on btct.co (dead now) and turned 1BTC into 12BTC, then I sold 9BTC for $900. I did lose 3BTC when a different company I invested in took the money and ran, but that is a different story (look up Labcoin on Bitcointalk). Overall I made $900 profit, but of course when the price hit $1000 I was disappointed that I missed the opportunity to make $9000.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:02:58
This has happened before and it will happen again. Negative news came out, people panicked, started selling. Price fell, more selling. Price will bottom out, people will start buying at new low price. Price will increase, people who sold out will panic again and buy in, price will increase more. Just leave your coins were they are or kick yourself in the ass in a few days/a week.
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:31:49
That's what I've noticed in my research.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:36:02
I saw it when it was first posted in /new and laughed it off too. Came back an hour later and it was on the front page.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:45:21
Both. I want it to stabilize so it can be a trusted as a solid currency, but in the mean time there is profit to be made. I have a mining rig so the higher the value of BTC the more money I am making.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:18:24
Don't worry about it. This has happened before and it will happen again. This is a panic selling phase and it will be followed by a panic buying phase that will drive the price back up.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:23:49
No, that was not the meat of what I said at all. Some of the community needs to mature up because they're acting like children. What, are you including yourself in that group or what?
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:14:09
Retroactive meaning will you reward me for installing a wallet on my android phone a week ago? I was joking, I recently started using bitcoin and I chose an android wallet for my primary wallet.

It depends on how much trouble you wanted to go through to be anonymous, but let's say you bought new cheap throw away laptop and connected to a public internet source to create a wallet. That wallet is not tied to you in any way. There are ways to scramble your bitcoins through laundering services.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:05:47
Exactly. Time to profit off the panic sellers before they return as panic buyers and drive the price back up.
