What is so wrong about not growing production when if there is enough stuff and services for everyone to be happy at that moment? Sounds like a good moment to put your money under your pillow for a rainy day. At least with bitcoins you know that that money you're saving will not be guaranteed to loose value like with fiat currency.

i don't have time at the moment to do a full review of your text. but i'll tell you what i think about the first paragraph. I imagined being not very interested in bitcoins to simulate a typical person.


Bitcoin is money. People give stuff to you, and you give them Bitcoins. You give stuff to people, and they give you Bitcoins. 
"ok clear"


"Huh, buy and sell? I don't buy and sell dollars." 


It's actually pretty simple. Let's say you want to buy a banana from a farmer's market.
"Yes banana. I like."


"I know what a wallet is. I don't call my own wallet a dollar wallet."


"Ok you lost me. Addresses in my dollar wallet? Sounds hard. Let's watch tv."

Do a google search for "Machinery of Freedom" by David Friedman on youtube. All questions you just posed are answered in that video.
