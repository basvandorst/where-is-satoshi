I'd sell it.  I don't know if it's going to increase in value or crash, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

It's a valid concern.  Bitcoin is primarily designed to be a currency, but it's users are treating it like a commodity.  The thing about commodities is that they can be used to create material wealth, which is something that Bitcoin either cannot do, or is something that no one has figured out how to do yet.  
This is new territory.  No one knows how it's going to act, because we have no good direct comparisons as to what bitcoin is.

I'm not sure what you mean by concern trolling.  All I'm doing is pointing out the fact that no one actually knows what is going to happen (though some people will have guesses that will be closer to the mark than others), and that people should act accordingly.  I don't know what risk portfolio you are willing to assume, and I can definitely see how bitcoin as an investment would be too volatile for a lot of people's tastes (myself included).  
The technology is not functioning as it was intended to, which means that it functioning as a store of value isn't working as intended either.  It remains to be seen if it will continue to act as a store of value where it will end up as an investment vehicle, or if people will lose faith in it and it ends up being a bubble.
Right now, from where I'm standing, it looks a lot like a fiat commodity like gold or silver.  Gold and silver are pretty stable because the international community pretty much agrees on using them as a store of value.  Oil has been working this way for a while as well, though oil has an obvious economic value besides being a trade commodity, as it can be directly used to create new wealth.  
I subbed to this subreddit a while ago to try and figure out what bitcoin was and to decide if I wanted to take the plunge.  So far I've been against it because the risks are higher than I'm willing to take on.  
That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin does end up having some staying power, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's a bubble that's about to pop.  Hell, both of these things could happen.  If you are willing to take the risk, then good on you, I hope it pays off.  If you aren't, then I understand because I'm in the same boat as you.  It seems a bit naive to pretend that there isn't a risk involved in using bitcoin as an investment vehicle though.

Flip a coin.  This is something that's never existed before.  Maybe it's a bubble, and maybe it's the cornerstone of a new world.

I don't know if bitcoin is going to have any staying power or not, but I'm not betting on it being a currency.  People are using it more like a trade commodity, which is interesting because those generally have a functional purpose.  
This is new territory.  Buyer beware.

It's cool.  I upvoted for the gay misuse.  As a cock gobbler myself I cannot abide the language police.

The axes do not match.

I'm an outsider in that I don't have any bitcoin, but here's my two bits.  If you got in on bitcoin early on, then you probably made out like a bandit.  I don't think that this is going to be a viable crypto currency for very much longer, because there are powerful people who either want to centralize it, or to kill and replace it with something that they can control more easily...  At least that's how it looks from the outside.  Anyway, there are other things that you can invest in, and having all of your eggs in one basket is kinda short sighted anyway.  Good luck in your future investments.

The x-axes don't match, so these data aren't related.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:39:24
Pretty much yeah.  I had just gotten to the point where I thought I understood what bitcoin is, and you guys start arguing about the proper syntax of a past perfect statements in Sanskrit, or some shit like that.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:02:25
that's better

What does HODL mean?  Hold on for dear life?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:55:26
If you are asking yourself that question, then I would start selling slowly.  You'll buy yourself some piece of mind by still coming out ahead if it is a bubble (I'm not saying it is, but it does look like a bubble), but you won't be missing out completely either.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:04:09
Yeah, last time I checked, 4chan was still around.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:31:08
That sucks.  You may want to look into having direct control over your bitcoin in the future.

I think that's from the first Predator movie.

Thanks for posting this.  I subscribed to this sub a while back hoping to make sense of it, and every time I think I'm getting a handle on what it actually is and how it works people start arguing about something new that doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:52:19
I think that's probably wrong since about 95% (myself included) don't know what the hell you guys are arguing about all the time.
I swear to god, every time I think I get a handle on what bitcoin actually is, another big to-do happens and everyone in the community starts arguing about something that makes absolutely no sense to anyone.  If you all really want regular people to start using crypto-currencies, we'll have to understand what we're buying when we get some.

I agree.  It appears that Jordan Peterson does too given that beyond this stance no one has anything to point to that suggests that he's alt-right.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:34:34
I agree with your post.  I don't think that this behavior should be legally mandated.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:45:12
Fair enough.  I hadn't read it.  The part in question was repealed back in 2013.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:26:33
That's not correct.  He took a stand over a compelled speech case that happened to center around the issue of preferred pronouns.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:49:18
Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights act (which C-16 amends) along with the C-16 provisions is exactly what Peterson was talking about.  Section 14 could possibly be interpreted that way as well.
