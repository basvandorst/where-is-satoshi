Does that mean that a transaction can only be an input once? Actually, I guess it can be an input once per output. So then to check for double spending, you just need to check that the transaction has not been an input, for this output. I assumed that you had to make sure the address has enough BTC by adding all the inputs, but it's easier to just check the input transactions.
Am I understanding this correctly?

For one thing, bitcoind is not supported on mac.
I haven't used bitcoind because I use a mac, but I imagine it's difficult to pass the output of one command to the input of another. The script I wrote makes this much simpler.
@_date: 2012-12-10 18:20:30
Got it. So in the transaction, since it's digital (i.e. binary) there is only one representation of the address.

Was bitfloor also using TrustCash?
What was the reason that they terminated the relationships?
@_date: 2012-12-04 21:59:28
Any idea why they stopped using those accounts?
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:52:36
Thanks. I didn't know that. There doesn't seem to be much documentation about bc1 addresses, and blockchain.info doesn't recognize it as a valid address.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:42:33
nice tip. I'm guessing you made a million too.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:16:23
Abe looks good, but it says it takes days to sync with the blockchain, and then it seems like updates are sketchy. I'll stick with blockchain.info, and go to blockexplorer.com as a backup. The whole blockchain just seems to big to manage on my own.
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:23:18
Wow. That's bleak. I'm scared now.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:38:47
Can you explain what happened and how you lost 5000 BTC? Was it an investment, or were you trading with them? I keep hearing people complaining, but I can't figure out the whole story.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:04:41
Usually it shows up quickly with them. However, lately, I've had to send an email to support to get it to show up. This is the third transaction that's taken a long time, but this is the longest by far.

Do you know what interest is nowadays. You're lucky to get 1% per year on a savings account. Let it go.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:27:48
When would a shorter chain have higher difficulty? Aren't all concurrent blocks the same difficulty?
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:07:56
I agree with you. I'm really just pointing out how much will be spent on mining if BTC reaches $1 million.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:21:21
I put up an ad and got one response. However, he didn't think there should be a markup because I wouldn't have to pay the exchange fee to sell. So that didn't work out.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:26:15
Taking the remainder isn't totally fair unless the smaller number is a factor of the larger one. The first entry has a better chance than the later entries. Think about 3 tickets and picking a number up to 10.  wins with 1,4,7,10 but  only wins with 3,6,9. With large enough numbers it's pretty close, but I'd still different. There's a way to make it fair, but it entails picking another number for certain outcomes.

I spoke to a lawyer, and I was told that BitFloor was a trust. They were just holding our money for us. It's not like we invested in them. If they don't give it back, it is plain old stealing.
Since Roman claims that all the money is still around, I believe we will get back every penny.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:26:52
That's what it costs. No way around it. You lose 1 or 2 % right off the bat. Although, I think your math is a bit off. It would be about $23 in fees for btc-e. Where did you get $36?
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:05:15
Would it be safe to move all the BTC to a new address in the same wallet? Or does the old wallet already have all the private keys for future addresses?
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:59:56
Thanks for the response. It seems like a really cool proposal.
I don't quite understand how the demurrage fees work though. Does that mean that my balance isn't really my balance if demurrage fees haven't been collected? If I have 10 coins, but I haven't done any transactions in 2 years, and I haven't been contributing to the network, then I only really have 9 coins? How would I know exactly what I owe? It seems like it would be easier to just add coins to everyone who is contributing.
Also, how is the random selection done? How do you ensure that it is really random?
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:53:17
I'll give you that. We can all be bitter. :(
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:32:44
I had the same thought. It's perfect for ransom. No more throwing a bag of money off a bridge from a moving car.
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:33:36
Thanks for trying to explain. Based on the response to this question, there doesn't seem to be many that understand it well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:12:51
People's time is part of the cost. But since this can be done anywhere in the world, there will be people doing it for close to nothing. 
If there are "excess" profits being made, then more people will start mining until there aren't excess profits. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:45:33
I'm not sure if anyone actually types them, but "0", "O", "I", and "l" are invalid characters and won't ever be in an address, so the creators had typing, or at least visual inspection, in mind.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:50:46
You need to make sure that your wallet.dat contains the private keys to all your addresses. It doesn't matter how many transactions are done. All transactions are saved in the blockchain. If your wallet is sending change to a different address, then you need to back up your wallet.dat again. If the change is going to addresses you already backup up, then you don't have to back up again.
@_date: 2013-03-05 21:22:01
Can you expand on that? I want to move some domains to namecheap (I already have one there), but I'm waiting for them to expire. What is this bonus you are referring to?
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:28:46
Everything is verified always. If you use a lower difficulty, it will not be accepted. One of the reasons that blockchain downloads take so long is because every block is being checked to verify it satisfies all the rules.
So, in addition to being the longest chain, every block must meet all the requirements. You can broadcast anything you want on the network, but only valid transactions and blocks will be accepted by other nodes.
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:53:13
If bitcoin reaches $1million / btc in the near future, then it will almost certainly be cheaper to mine than to buy coins, unless people are spending $1 billion / day to mine. Let's say this happens when a new block yields 6 BTC, there will be over $800 million of btc generated each day. So, if people are only spending $100 million on mining per day, I can spend an additional $100 million per day and get half the mined coins, or $400 million per day from mining.

It's been 4 hours now, and no confirms. I've never seen this happen before. 
Doesn't anyone want my $0.12? ;)
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:29:09
So the hash is done on data that works with both at the same time? In other words, there is extra data in there that won't be used by one blockchain or the other? Am I understanding that correctly?
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:54:05
I agree. But if the case was cut and dry, it would be so tempting.
Imagine if one the large pools got hit. I can imagine all the large pools joining together to get the guy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:13:54
Not if you can make more than $1000. Someone out there has $1000, and he can either mine himself, or lend it to someone to start mining.
You don't think there are rich people trying to make more money. They will buy asic chips until it isn't worth it anymore.
Let's put it this way. Right now, there is $200 million a year to be made in mining. You don't think that will attract people with money?
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:36:13
The second sha256 hash does seem to solve the problem, unless ... we run an infinite number of raffles, in which case some will never resolve. I think I got ya there.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:38:45
From what I've seen, all exchanges offer an API. In addition to MtGox and btc-e, I know that CampBx and BitStamp also have APIs. Which exchanges don't have an API?

Got the call today from the credit union. Got an account number and entered it on bitfloor. Now waiting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:01:24
It's econ 101. If people are making money, and there aren't any barriers to entry, then more people will come to make money. 
If you heard you could make a million dollars by mining, would you do it. What if you could only make $1000? How about $100? The profits will decrease until it's not worth entering the market.
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:43:57
I think you meant 0.0064 dollars. That's 0.64 cents.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:46:51
When we're spending a billion dollars a year on power, that will be pretty bad. Do all the banks in the world combined spend a billion on power? They might spend more than that on operations, but only a small percentage of that is going to their power bill.
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:37:09
Now it all makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:34:23
After the first confirm, the rest will always come quickly. The first confirm means it's on the blockchain. After that, it shows how deep in the blockchain it is. Each new mined block will increase the confirms.
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:38:24
With a $2 difference, it's definitely worthwhile. The transaction fees would total about 0.1% (bitfloor is 0.4%, I think). That's about 4 cents per bitcoin. If you have money in both exchanges you would make a profit.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:28:17
In the US, this would be illegal. It's straight out gambling. I hope, for your sake, it's legal in Canada.
Have you thought about the tax consequences of this. The winner may have to pay income tax on the price of the condo. It's still a good deal for the winner, but he might have to pay a good chunk out of pocket.
