Lossy, not loss-less. If the scrambling is big enough there is no reconstruction possible. Even with that [pedo who twirled this face]( you could still see artifacts after untwirl, so there wasn't a prefect reconstruction.

Would it be possible to decentralize this in some way? Maybe have people run nodes which do the work, and backup parts of the data, and then have the system pay them for the work? Seems like it could be more robust.
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:06:50
Does anyone have a clue where those 'lost' coins are? It should be quite easy to track them if the original addresses were known right? That could easily tell if hackers made off with it, or if the key was forgotten. 
How are we to ever believe the key to be lost? For all we know Mark still has access to it and could start moving them whenever he feels like it and is in a place that won't prosecute him.

No, not necessarily, third parties are picking it up. Changetip is an example. I can imagine a trusted third party similar to Changetip offering micro transaction service. Sure it's not full decentralization anymore, but it could work quite well.

You are using it as a feasible microtransaction service. You can't do microtransactions on the blockchain otherwise many tips will cost more than they actually give.
If you receive a tip you can easily send it to a wallet and then remove your changetip account.
Hopefully one day a decentralized micropayment/tipping option will be developed. Until that day I don't mind using changetip.

It would be interesting to do a study of comments on Bitcoin articles over time. The comments in this article again show a lot of complete retards, but also quite a few people with a positive/open opinion. I wonder if there is a positive trend in comments.

@_date: 2014-09-14 09:42:09
The influence of that number very much depends on the size of the market. Regardless of the size of the market, the absolute number of new coins mined means a yearly [inflation rate of &gt;10%]( until the next halving.
Only in 2021 will the inflation be lower than on average in the developed world.

Yes Bitcoin is unique and not really comparable to markets or technologies as it is both. However it is not possible for Bitcoin to have large market saturation if the total value doesn't increase a lot. If billions of people eventually use Bitcoin then the value would need to be at least on the order of $100,000/BTC for everyone to be able to own a few hundred $ worth. This isn't even considering the Bitcoin needed by business and financial institutions.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:34:37

Screw [Mt. Gox data]( I just made this chart in Excel based on Bitstamp data, which runs up to the current price. It seems to fit better: [R^2 of 0.92 vs 0.84](
And while we are now under the trendline, we were there for a much longer period after the previous bubble.
Here's hoping for $100,000 in June 2016. Though I highly doubt it to be honest as true exponential growth can never be sustained, it always flattens out into an S-curve. [Just look at these curves]( for adoption of new technology.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin is a global success and adopted as quickly as the smartphone, the S-curve holds and growth will slow down a bit near the end, so it will take longer for it to reach $100,000. If we imagine Bitcoin being used by 5 billion people in 2020 which might well be possible since today [80-90%]( of people have cell phones. This would mean at $100,000/BTC and with an estimated 2 million BTC of 18 million mined being lost, there would only be $320 worth of BTC for every user.
**Edit**: Made [another graph]( This one includes a trend line based on the only the data when we weren't in a bubble. The idea is that this one represents the price we reach during the periods in between inevitable bubbles. This shows us reaching 100K about 7 months later. 
**Edit2**: [Another graph]( this one combines the Bitstamp data with MtGox data from before Bitstamp existed, this is the most complete timeseries possible.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:58:26

Western Union easily extorts 10%-20% fees depending on the amount you send and many people send small amounts back home. If someone set up a Bitcoin account they could send money back with much lower fees. Thereby greatly increasing the money the families back home get.

@_date: 2014-05-22 08:24:17
They have also [updated the parsing]( of the tip commands. 
I'm really happy about this. Normally changetip would scan the comment for the lowest amount mentioned. So for example you mention 1 satoshi in your comment, then later you want to tip a person like this: 
Thanks! 1000 bit /*u/changetip
In this case changetip would have sent 1 satoshi, now it first scans the line where it's called on, so it now takes the correct 1000 bit command.

@_date: 2014-05-15 09:43:22
Thanks for the tip!
Still I can imagine talking about giving your $0.02 cents in a thread and then wanting to tip someone a dollar or something. Many other examples can occur and I simply think spelling out numbers in other parts of your comment is an unneeded hassle. I think the bot should initially search for a tip immediately preceding or following its name, if that doesn't exists it can search the rest of the comment for an amount.
So if you say $5 /u*/changetip it will take the $5 and not the $0.02 I mention here or earlier in the thread.

I was linked to this site a while ago and it's a really nice concept. I [just went to donate]( enough to add another node. 
However, to my surprise the site doesn't show who created it or who I can contact. Who is running this site? I really want to suggest they put in the option of giving a node a custom name when you donate. I think that could boost donations quite a bit.

The donation site: 
I really like that when you donate you get the option to directly donate the euro value of the bitcoin, or you can request them to only convert the bitcoin at the end of the campaign (red and orange portions of the donation bar respectively).
Bitonic is also the easiest way to get Bitcoin in the Netherlands. No questions asked for anything up to €50, for amounts above you only have to send one cent once to their bank account, to verify your own. No other details required. You can pay via iDeal which is an easy online banking system we have, so you get your coins nearly instantly. They also get a referal link after purchase that nets you 0,3% comission on the referred sales: 
They have sold more than 120,000 bitcoins since may 2012

Blender is miles beyond Bryce. Bryce is a nice program with an easy learning curve, but you quickly run in to all kinds of limits. There's no good hard surface modelling, no particles, no UV texturing, no physics, very limited render engine, etc. Bryce also has mostly stagnated since it was bought by Daz3D.
Blender on the other hand is constantly in development and is currently starting to rival the big packages such as 3Dmax and Maya, in some cases even overtaking them. At least that's what some people who know the programs tell me.

There are 100,000,000 Satoshis in 1 Bitcoin. 100,000,000 is a very large and abstract number, so by stacking a 100,000,000 tiny coins you get an idea of how large a number that is.

The shorter the time range the less accurate it will be which is quite obvious when there are multiple bubbles. 
The blue, purple, and green lines in your chart (which doesn't show the date btw) are all the shortest time ranges and clearly are for a large part in a bubble regime which makes their predictions so high. Whereas all the longer timeseries seem to converge on an exponential trend with relatively small variance.

Bitcoin is not just a market, it's a technology too, so comparing it to markets is not very useful besides on the timescales of bubbles maybe. The long term growth is fundamentally due to the evolution of the Bitcoin technology and its adoption.

An index fund doesn't really compare to actually investing in the internet.

What about technological adoption rates, don't you think these look similar and have a trend of happening in increasingly shorter timespans?
If you haven't noticed that technological development has been increasing exponentially then you have not been paying attention. The trend I plotted assumes that Bitcoin is a technology which will follow a typical S-curve, i.e. exponential growth for the foreseeable future. Whether Bitcoin truly is a revolutionary technology remains to be seen.

There is still movement between the offchain and main blockchain, only it will happen in larger chunks. Because if a merchant using Bitpay wants to cash out eventually Bitcoin will need to be traded for USD. The miners will start asking higher fees, which will move most small transactions off chain, while big institutions like Bitpay will have to make up the difference. Kind of like how the interbanking system works, consumers never touch it, but banks use it all the time.

I would see a wallet integrated in windows as a wallet you take on the street, i.e. with no more than a few $100 in it. However I don't see an integrated wallet as having much advantage over a simple download.
Big money should be in cold storage, which is too cumbersome for Bitcoin to hit mainstream, but it could also be in trustworthy Bitcoin banks, which would obviously charge a lot less than traditional bank. I think the trustworthy part is a problem at the moment, and it will take a while before any one could be considered secure IMO.

I do agree with this on basic stocks. However my thesis is that Bitcoin is not just a stock, it's a singular technology. And technologies **if successful** get adopted via an S-curve which is exponential until it comes close to saturation. It was never possible to invest in the internet, or in phones, it was only possible to invest in companies making them. With Bitcoin you can invest in the technology.

You could just enter your Bitcoin addresses in the program and it will track all you payments and the day they were made, then generate the tax report automatically. Or a wallet could be made with this as an in-built feature.

I'm very excited about the implications this market might have if it gets developed successfully. Things like the proven identity, ratings, and third party escrow will insure that scams remain at an absolute minimum. While Bitcoin payment allows all countries to do business with each other and removes most of the commission, sites like eBay and Amazon charge their sellers. This means cheaper, safer, and otherwise not-for-sale, products.
Now with the auction system it could become a serious competitor with eBay and also result in a large legal market along the inevitable grey market.
I'm really hoping development goes well and I would love some updates. I also donated to the project, and hope others support them too:

Gavin Andresen, the main dev, amongst many others. I don't know how the echo chamber has been in here lately. But not investing more than you can afford to lose has been the most common advice I've seen. The thing is, bitcoin can either get really successful, or be superseded and worth little. The second option is a real possibility, so that's why you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin can function in the way as a back as a store of value. Sure it's not insured, but if you use cold storage it's extremely secure. 
You don't get interest, but if Bitcoin is successful, the deflationary nature will make sure you beat inflation, which can't be said for most savings accounts.
The payment services are also similar to what a back provides, only a bit more limited for now.
Wiring money to people functions better then backing does, assuming they also use it.
Overall I think it's quite fair to say you can be your own bank with Bitcoin

Very unlikely indeed. If there is any pattern in Bitcoin it's bubbles, and we do seem to be in a bubble again, but it probably won't go much higher than $5000 give or take a few thousand, as each new bubble has increased less in percent from the previous all time high. Then there will most likely be a crash again to a level somewhere above the previous all time high. 
I wouldn't be surprised if the bubble after this one, somewhere in 2015 will reach it.

Do realize that if Bitcoin reaches $10,000, then $3,600,000 (25 bitcoin/10 minutes * 6 * 24 * $10,000) will be mined daily. So this would need to flow into the market daily to keep up with inflation.

[Here is the original submission]( I got some feedback that the scale wasn't clear, and that a single coin was not visible. I've addressed those issues here. 
The big pyramid is approximately 100,000,000 coins (i.e. 1 BTC). The smaller pyramid is approx 100,000 coins (i.e. 1 millibit), and the tiny stack is 100 coins (i.e. 1 ubit). 
I've also added a smartphone for some scale, with the blockchain app showing a QR code of one of my addresses (Edit: Awesome, just got my first donation via a QR code ever! Thanks whoever you are!)
The sun lamp is mostly for decoration, but also represents 1 BTC

No it's more a general concern. I am assuming as Bitcoin becomes more popular there will be more Bitcoin targeted malware. The vectors this will be spread in will also most likely relate to Bitcoin. I'm pretty careful, but probably still exposed to good exploits or packaged malware in some cases.
For example when [listentobitcoin was taken over]( the new owner put malware on it. The browser detected it, but a 0-day exploit would have been missed.

My main theory is that the miners who invested during the last bubble have been largely responsible for the downward pressure. While the miners might prefer to hold on to the coins, expecting higher values, a lot of the large operations have costs they must pay, i.e. electricity, warehouse rent, ASIC manufacturers, etc. When multiple of these operations have to do this they will be in a race to the bottom to get the necessary funds, even selling at a loss, just to keep the operation running in hopes of better prices in the future.
3600 coins are mined each day, the majority of which are probably mined by large operations. If these operations have to pay their bills no matter what then maybe 2000 coins enter the market each day. It could even be more if big operations have to sell off their Bitcoin reserves they might have been saving in hopes of higher prices. Many people spooked by the price drops caused by this might follow the miners and depress the price even further.
Another possibility might be that the Gox coins were actually stolen and they are being sold, but I would think the blockchain detectives would have noticed that.

Armory has a good tutorial: 
I just wrote out the key string Armory gave to restore the wallet from scratch. Armory allows you to check the key, so I took the one I wrote down and entered it and knew I wrote it down correctly.
Then I simply sent my balance to one of the generated addresses with Qt as you said.
I first tried the whole process with a test wallet I sent a tiny amount to. Then I regenerated the wallet on my online computer and it all checked out.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:32:13
But I'm talking about a wallet I might want to use when I'm already browsing on the OS and want to buy something, order some food, give a tip, etc. Rebooting is too much of a hassle for that. I guess just keeping a small amount and keeping windows and AV up to date, is the best I can do. Though I think I will try the onscreen keyboard with hover keys for a few characters of my passphrase.

Bitcoin was not finished yet when Satoshi first launched it. There a multiple ideas of how to deal with the transaction limit. It's being worked on, but a solution will probably require a hard fork.
Optimization can also increase it quite a bit: 
You could greatly increase the block size, this will lead to a very big blockchain, but nothing that the cheap HDDs of nowadays can't handle. A most people wouldn't need to run full nodes anyway.
Off-chain transactions that get bundled in a single one is one effective way. You could also imagine a state in the future where only large transaction pools with significant fees get sent between intermediaries over the network.

It's not really about the absolute height of the pyramid, the exact size of the coins is kind of irrelevant as there is no real Satoshi. This is about relative sizes and the difference in magnitudes between 1 unit and 100,000,000 of them. It helps to get an idea of how big the divisibility of 1 BTC actually is, as a number that large is kind of meaningless without context.

Outside of the Bitcoin community I would still suggest saving up and giving one $0.50 tip rather than giving 50x $0.01 tips.
For most people outside this subreddit it will be their first tip and if they find out they've only got a cent or less they probably won't be very enthusiastic and won't even take the time to set up a account, let alone investigate Bitcoin further. 
Furthermore if you make a lot of small, nearly worthless tips on other subreddits it will start to look spammy and moderators might be more inclined to ban it.

No I don't day trade, as in the short term Bitcoin does behave like a market with bubbles, shocks and all, and as such is fundamentally unpredictable.

The basic terminator scenario is something we have to work very hard to avoid. Elon Musk who has been a visionary in many fields has said "[The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five year timeframe. 10 years at most. (...) This is not a case of crying wolf about something I don't understand.]( Besides his good track record on tech he also has more inside knowledge than most people have. He has [access to the real state of the art](




An evolving system of agents based on adding value to human experience as I describe is a possible way to avoid a bad scenario. If such a system becomes the first to reach a superintelligent state there is a good chance that it will continue acting towards the betterment of humanity and it will be able to prevent potentially bad AIs from wreaking havoc. The problem is that the first intelligent system is much more likely going to be an uncaring but effective, and potentially deadly AI than a system evolved with an intrinsic motivation to make things better for humanity.

2020 could very well be too optimistic, however you should consider that after the internet, the cell phones came and were adopted quicker, smartphones are currently being adopted quicker than cell phones were. It's always speeding up.
From the article I linked to.


Do you really think so many Africans have multiple phones?


Bitcoin can be so much more than just a payment system, for example the darkmarket, clever contracts, secure identification, etc. If these uses take off then Bitcoin might be much more like a vital modern tech and could see the same adoption as smartphones. Also internet, smart phones, and cell phones in the developing world are the platforms that will make the adoption of Bitcoin so much easier.

The number of physical stores accepting Bitcoin is still very low, which is understandable because the Bitcoin users are spread thin.

Here's hoping for $100,000 in June 2016. Though I highly doubt it to be honest, it would mean a market cap of [$1.6 trillion]( True exponential growth can never be sustained, it always flattens out into an S-curve. [Just look at these curves]( for adoption of new technology.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin is a global success and adopted as quickly as the smartphone, the S-curve holds and growth will slow down a bit near the end, so it will take longer for it to reach $100,000. If we imagine Bitcoin being used by 5 billion people in 2020 which might well be possible since today [80-90%]( of people have cell phones. This would mean at $100,000/BTC and with an estimated 2 million BTC of 18 million mined being lost, there would only be $320 worth of BTC for every user.

So for example if you tried to explain the internet to someone, you could do it technically like the video you sent and talk about TCP/IP etc, or you could talk about the application, i.e. communication with people, online shopping, information, news etc. I'm looking for something like this.

This rise is nearly all based on equities being bought with QE money, and money borrowed at extremely low interest. There has been no real improvement in the economy and the GDP growth is fudged because it also counts some of this financial movement in the numbers.

That's what the market is for, it's ultimately up to them to guess the true value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:27:34
It's not possible for Bitcoin to have large market saturation if the total value doesn't increase a lot. If billions of people eventually use Bitcoin then the value would need to be at least on the order of $100,000/BTC for everyone to be able to own a few hundred $ worth. This isn't even considering the Bitcoin needed by business and financial institutions.

An even better version of this would be one where you can import your transaction history exported from your wallet. To this you could add your storage addresses so it knows that the money sent to cold storage is still yours. The program then scrapes the balance history over time and applies the value conversion at each timestep. On the chart it could display markers whenever significant BTC input/outputs occurred. A bar chart could track the total number of bitcoins.
You could go even further and estimate how much dollars were spent at each point when Bitcoin was added to the balance, and how much bitcoin/dollars were spent each time you paid for something with Bitcoin.
This could also give really fun and useful stats like how much did you pay in total and how much is it worth now. You could also see how much you'd be worth if you had never spent or cashed out any bitcoin. 
I'd love these features and I think something like this might prove popular. I could easily code the basic operation for personal use, but I have no idea how I'd make it run online and allow it to process any user's data.

It's the metric prefix: 
Like meters, e.g. nanometer, kilometer. Or bytes, kilobyte, megabyte. It scales by three orders of magnitude per term, i.e. 1000x.
Giga (G) = 1,000,000,000  
Mega (M) = 1,000,000  
Kilo (k) = 1,000  
1,0  
Milli (m) = 0.001  
Micro (μ) = 0.000,001  
Nano = (n) 0.000,000,001  
mBTC stands for milli (m) BTC, so 0,001 BTC  
uBTC stands for micro (μ) BTC, so 0,000,001 BTC
Conversely 1 BTC is 100,000,000 Satoshi, so you could say 100 Megasatoshi.
If we use microbitcoin (uBTC) as our nominal value then:  
1,000,000 uBTC = 1 BTC  
1 uBTC = 100 satoshi  
This is familiar for many people because they are used to dollar (or euro) and cent. If we use uBTC as our standard, one satoshi would be similar to a cent.
As an example, say you give or pay someone 0.000124054 BTC, that's really hard to read. But if you use uBTC as your standard it would become 1240.54 uBTC. Much more manageable right? 
Also makes reading your wallet balance easier, as all those numbers behind the decimals are quite confusing.

IIRC Bill Gates main complaints about Bitcoin were the volatility and that there is no consumer (i.e. chargeback) protection.
The second point can already be solved if you set p a payment system that uses a smart multi-sig system. Of course you'd have to pay a little bit for the option of having easy chargebacks and conflict moderation.
I think that the volatility will become less once bitcoin is more developed, worth much more, and more liquid. If the market is big  and liquid enough, a few whale sized speculators don't have the power to move the the market anymore. Also if Bitcoin proves strong a problem resistant then at some point few news items can be big enough to cause a large movement.

With Bitpay merchants can specify the fraction they want in BTC and fiat.

True, a high budget is not necessary, but I think it needs to be at least 20-30 minutes, be shot on a decent camera, and edited by a competent person. The longer time is needed to capture the history behind the Outpost, then the Bitcoin revolution and how it impacted the project, then Satoshi's forest. Hopefully also interviews with the homeless and how it has impacted them.
Maybe you can volunteer to shoot it? Do you have any previous work to show? You might be able to convince the community to fund your trip.

No, this level occurs every now and then, but is not normal. Look at the [chart for the last year]( and see that while growth is quite consistent, these levels are not frequent and don't last long.

 you can look further back as the rise is displayed relative to the price and not in absolute terms. The peaks above the main trend are periods with similar growth as we're having now.

Sean, the stories coming from your outpost are often unbelievable in good awesome ways, and sometimes terribly depressing ways like here. I've said it before to you but never got a reply, I think it would be a great idea if you could get some people to do a documentary on your outpost, the people you help (if they want to be interviewed of course), and on the (Bitcoin) community helping you.
I think a documentary like this could be very beneficial for exposure and funding of the project, but also for people to develop more compassion for these homeless people, their stories, and their horrible treatment by law enforcement and the city. Also a documentary would be great for all those people who have funded you and live all across the country and the world.
The cost of a documentary could be a problem though. However I think if you do a call out in the community you might find people willing to help. Maybe people from a film school would do it for a small budget. Then you could ask the community to fund the doc.
Anyway, I really love your work!

This is still not nearly as easy as I can buy them. Here in the Netherlands there are a number of trustworthy sites where you can use the very safe iDeal internet banking system to pay for coins which are then instantly sent to your wallet.

These would be very special ones, like collector coins. You may be right it might be better to go with lower denominations first if I model more coins. On the other hand the coins represent a special way for storing wealth in a relatively safe physical, preferably locked in a safe. For lower denominations you would simply use your existing wallet.

True I didn't age or weather the materials, as I'm not proficient in that yet and this was just an afternoon project. The huge node network that can go into materials in cycles is quite intimidating but definitely something I want to learn. Also I see these as newly minted coins, and also in my mind these coins are a store of quite some value, to be locked in a safe, not something you keep in your wallet, so they probably won't see much wear and tear during their life.

When many people saw their BTC wealth increasing in dollar value spending them became much less of an issue. I felt quite good buying electronics at half the price I originally bought Bitcoin in.

Oh my Bitcoin, this subreddit has been completely twisted into the state is was in, in April. So many posts trying to say this is not a bubble, this time is different, then getting so many upvotes and people believing in it.
Yes Bitcoin is awesome and there are a ton of reasons to give it value. However such enormous growth figures point to hype-induced manic Bitcoin buying and speculation, and not actual valuation of what it is now. Bitcoin has shown steady growth throughout, but bubbles have also occured and everytime they were preceded by these unsustainable price increases. There will probably be a cycle of bubbles until the market is large, well known, and useful enough. Then there is no reason for hype driving speculation.

Once you learn the basics, the are quite a number of relatively easy to follow tutorials which will have you making impressive scenes in no time. I think the [Blender Cookie basics tutorial]( is quite good.
However, be warned closely following a tutorial will give you a very similar scene, but something no tutorial can teach you is to be creative. So either don't follow the tutorial exactly and make it your own thing, or after a tutorial try to think up something yourself. Further you need to have an eye for making things look good, lighting, angle, frame, etc. If this doesn't come naturally you can get a lot of good tips from photography framing and lighting guides.
Once you got the basics you'll be able to follow most tutorials and can find something to suit you. [Here]( is a pretty basic one showing how a Tron scene can be done (notice many tutorial videos display the keystrokes in the corner of the interface, play in HD).
[The Blender Guru tutorials]( are very good at making impressive scenes, though sometimes without explaining well why and how the things you are doing are working.
Good luck! And try not to give up during the steep part of the learning curve, most of the fun starts after!

The previous replies missed one of the biggest aspects: Remittances




These remittances currently go through services such as Western Union which charge extortionate fees, which is especially cruel since these are poor folk sending money to even poorer folk back home. This is a huge potential market for Bitcoin as the transaction fees are negligible. Furthermore, Africa has proven to be able to very quickly incorporate new systems in their economy if they offer concrete benefits. The cell phone and M-Pesa payment system are good examples.

However I think the rewards from doing some creative work are much higher than having my GPU produce a lot of heat and few Bitcoins. I'd rather buy Bitcoins directly. Also the ASICs will make GPUs nearly worthless I think.

Exactly, that's why I was curious if anyone knows the number of ASICs that have been ordered. Then you could estimate the expected return in BTC of each ASIC by adding all their computing power including what's currently online and dividing the released Bitcoins by this number. Then multiply the result with the computing power of a single ASIC. Or is my thinking wrong here?

Of course there are many people who are in it for the long run, but most of them are early adopters so they don't move the price much these days.

Notice the €2 coin for size. The coins are just nice trinkets to have though, they have no real BTC value.

Then the owner of  contacted me to ask if he could make physical versions of them to sell in his store. Of course I gave permission and got two coins for free as a reward. Never expected this to happen by simply posting some pretty pictures :)

Miners don't pay an exchange fee :) 
Overall exchange fees aren't that high, 0.5% at bitstamp is fine for buying, but is annoying if you want to speculate on the price and trade frequently. If Bitcoins keep circulating then only transaction fees are paid, so if the merchant spends his Bitcoin again it stays in the system. The consumers will have to keep going through exchanges unless they can get part of their salary in Bitcoin, which is already becoming possible at some places.
The merchant can choose their own exposure, it could be 5% BTC, 0% or a 100. 5% would be very low risk, as that's probably within the profit margin and the amount saved on CC fees.
Looking at the history of Bitcoin I would keep a relatively high % in Bitcoin and then cash out parts on the way up.

I think $15 is not a strange valuation. I believe in Bitcoin, but I do think it is overvalued at this point, just like the internet was in 2000, and then it recovered again. 
I say this because we now have a value of $1.5 billion, while each month I would estimate there is only an actual trade in the few 10s of millions of dollars. With trade I mean the cumulative of Bitpay, bitcoinstore, Silk Road etc. This means that most of the people holding coin are in it for the speculation and many of these people will panic once there is a big hit, the bubble will pop and Bitcoin will crash. But this won't be bad for Bitcoin or the merchants, the Bitcoin system will work perfectly fine whether it's valued at 15 or 500.
Also if this bubble pops, it will be a great time to buy Bitcoin, because usually something becomes very undervalued after a bubble pops.

Bitcoins to the rescue?
Did some digging and there could be a huge market for Bitcoins here.


that between **US$750 million and US$ 1 billion enters Somalia each year** making it the
fourth most remittance dependent country in the world, with remittances contributing
between 20% and 50% of the country’s GDP.


With the near zero cost of sending Bitcoins, it should be very cheap and easy for a start-up in Somalia to set up a remittance fund which converts Bitcoins to a local currency and charges much less than 5%, quickly cornering the huge market.

The photo isn't that good due to the lighting, they [look and shine much better]( in this photo. I posted this photo because it give a good idea of the size of the coins, the weight is also very nice, they are die pressed. The coins are just nice trinkets to have though, they have no real BTC value.
This was really made possible by how awesome the internet and this community is. The story behind how I got these coins is that a while ago I posted some [renderings of imaginary Bitcoins]( I made and these became quite popular. 
Then the owner of  contacted me to ask if he could make physical versions of them to sell in his store. Of course I gave permission and got two coins for free as a reward. Never expected this to happen by simply posting some pretty pictures :)

The Mexican cartels have become the most powerful by far, even moving in on the production side in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Would $40 million per year in commissions be worth it for a cartel making billions? Here is a fascinating article on [Mexico's Cartels and the Economics of Cocaine](
However they could of course also move in on the vendor side in the US. So they could ship their cocaine to some of their own distributors in the US, then charge inflated online market prices to their clients. This would mean reaping huge profits between the $24,000/kg wholesale prices and the $100,000 street prices. The mexican-US vendors could cash out the Bitcoin and use the same smuggling routes to get the cash back.

To be honest, considering the extreme price surge of the past days we are probably in a bubble at the moment, take a look at [this log chart]( which clearly shows the previous bubbles and this period is clearly visible too. I think it will crash when it reaches $400-500. Then it will crash and stabilize around 200-250 if it follows the April bubble pattern. However, unlike in April, this time the Chinese are in on the game and seem to be a big wildcard. If they keep buying and holding it might turn out not to be a bubble. This is all just speculation on my part though.
Conclusion, I wouldn't buy Bitcoins now unless you planning to follow the rise of the bubble and sell before the crash.

We would need a new name for it though. uBit sounds okay and logical to me. Like uTorrent. I know it's pronounced mu, but mu sounds wrong.
1 satoshi is our cent then. So if Bitcoin gets really expensive in the future you can say I'll have the Royal Bitburger menu for 5 ubit 99 please :)

This is just a test render using [the coins I shared here previously]( 
This was rendered with the Blender internal engine and not with cycles which is why these coins don't look nearly as good as [the stills I made]( I had to use the other engine because Cycles rendering takes much too long on my machine because I don't have an Nvidia GPU. 
The scene was set up in Blender using a particle system emitting coins and a rigid body simulation. I think I need to tweak the physics parameters some more to make the coins behave more realistic. If I have some spare time I'll try making a nicer scene and better quality render with more coins next :)

Great news. I emailed Ton to ask for this a while ago, and he said it was on the todo list.

It's fascinating, I'm sure a lot of papers will be published. This bubble can be studied in such depth and is also unique in that BTC has 24/7 trading. And there's a lot of articles and talk available about it online.
I held my finger above the sell button at around $260, wanted to sell about a fifth, but didn't. I'm not very bitter though I don't have a lot and bought in at an average of $35.
[Here is my comment]( from 6 days ago, got a few downvotes too.

People would move out of the mining pool if it is close to becoming a danger to the network. The miners don't want worthless BTC.

Maybe the CCP sees, or will see the potential of Bitcoin to boost their trade with Africa. China is already investing hugely in Africa and the coming decades will probably see a lot of economic development combined with much better internet infrastructure and smartphone adoption. Bitcoin is perfect for smartphone payments and could become huge in Africa, especially in countries where there are currency and trade problems. Once Africans have more money to spend they can become a huge market for Chinese products.

Interesting points and thanks for elaborating them. I can see where you're coming from, but I don't really agree on mosts parts and I think many other people also don't. But of course design is very subjective and all.
I purposely didn't give them any grunge or texture because they're supposed to be 'perfect'. The picture would have looked much messier had I grunged up the coins. Also if you were going to make a [real macro shot]( of coins you'd use newly minted ones. 
If 3D renderings have a place in design or if we all need to keep following the clean cartoony logo trend of the last years is very subjective. Many people do seem to like the visual aspects.
Your final point should have been thought of by Satoshi before he named it ***coin. Nearly all sites promoting or using Bitcoins display them as coin logos. In the media you also see coins everywhere and even see a lot of real casascius coins. I think anyone who reads more than a few paragraphs about bitcoin knows that they don't have to physically exist. It's just a nice way see them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:51:40

No, you could give the coins to anyone and they could own them, however if you want to transfer them digitally you would have to break the seal to access the key to send the money.

Also, the network on the 1 coin supposed to represent a p2p network. In the [3D models]( there is also binary on the side which spells 'Bitcoin' and ' Vires in Numeris' on the side of the 5 coin.

What utter cunts. This reminds me of Grapes of Wrath I recently read. I'm not from the US, is it common for the law to bully the homelss like that?

That they are even talking about it is a big thing, if only a small number become interested it could spread just like it did here. Many people on reddit and especially other communities are also still very skeptical of Bitcoin, it's still a relatively small group in the West who are actually interested in Bitcoin.

I rendered this with Blender, which is free and open source (they accept [donations in BTC]( render time about 1 hour. For those wanting some more traditional colors, [here is a much warmer yellow orange glowing version]( I'm not completely happy with it, and still want to do some fixes, maybe change the composition too. Thought I'd share it anyway, hope you like it, and feedback is appreciated.
I've made other renders of Bitcoins before, [here is an album]( and here is a [bitcointalk thread]( giving more detail on the work and includes some animation too. As I've said in the title, all my work is free for personal, promotional, or commercial use.

The coins don't have a real BTC value and are just nice objects to have. [Here]( are the coin models they are based on. Isokivi from btctrinkets approached me if he could use my design for physical versions, I gladly permitted it, and didn't even ask for compensation. But I got it anyway :)

You know your stuff. The I did the binary with a boolean mesh of the text and used a curve modifier to join make the strip in a circle. Where the edges met up it didn't really match up right so I kludged the edges. That's the only place I used boolean though.
The 1 I did mess up quite a bit. I think I made a mesh out of it then used an inset, raised it for the edge and then subdivision made the rest of the mess.
I don't really see the problem with the hard edges in the rendered result though.
Still a lot to learn.
It's interesting to see how critical CGI people react, whereas normal people seem to appreciate the work. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:08:29
When I make the improved (higher res) version I'll do one with only green too. Now you can still see a bit of orange running under the gold coin. Also here is a [smoother fade]( I think looks quite nifty too.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:46:04
To elaborate on this, every block that is mined contains in it the transactions that took place between the blocks. All the fees from the transactions are then given to the miner who mined that block. As Bitcoin grows and more transactions take place, the fees will become an increasingly large part of the share until they become the only reward.
If the fees are not enough to satisfy the cost of the miners' hardware, they could demand larger fees for transactions. This could maybe lead to third party services pooling transactions under a single fee. This would also reduce the amount of transactions that would need to be processed.

I said $15 would not be strange, equally $50 wouldn't be. But as per my argument concerning the actual trade in Bitcoins I think the current valuation is unsustainable due to the amount of speculation. Many speculators are in it for the short term profits and aren't going to wait patiently until a coin is worth $1000 or $0. Once a big hit happens, MtGox being hacked again or something, many will cut their losses, or profits, and run. Many speculators who have little knowledge of Bitcoin will join and panic sell. After the market recovers and barring any fundamental flaws in the system I think you will see the price rise at a steady pace reflecting the actual use of bitcoin as a currency.
