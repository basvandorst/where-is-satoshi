It's in shibernation.

To access the private keys with mine you have to carefully cut away the laminate and unfold the paper to see the private key
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:14:31
Read the comments brah.
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:21:23
just copy the address and send whatever amount you like
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:25:25
It's only $12 per year.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:40:37
Im not sure how that would work because the bitcoin donation button makes a new address for every transaction. Is there a way to look at the transactions from the whole account?
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:25:32
I bought from the Titan guys at inside bitcoin in NYC. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:50:40
I know Its not foolproof but its still pretty secure.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:25:09
Thank you! Printing, laminating and adding the btc for under $10. Worth it.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:37:57
I bought a kit at bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Ubuntu live cd with bit address and printing set up on it and I got some cool hologram stickers. They give you plastic bags but I like to laminate them.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:51:51
Not yet. I can make lite coin wallets though.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:45:19
Fine my motivation to give out btc is so they will join my cult and I can rule the world. Happy?
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:11:55
Thanks! I had the same thought haha
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:34:10
I bank at a local credit union. They know me by name and I am not worried about them seizing my box. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:11:34
bitcoinpaperwallet.com 
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:16:18
I have another copy so i import the coins.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:48:31
I like the fact that I can physically see the address' s and I don't have to worry about encryption and all that jazz.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:03:47
Watch this video it explains everything 
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:26:29
That's a Titan .1 BTC coin and my laminated BTC/Doge paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:32:27
So true.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:52:54
good idea thanks
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:04:57
Sling shot. Check.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:00:11
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:33:37
He just spoke at inside bitcoin. He said he is behind bitcoin all the way and if we locked the doors at the conference and wrote a bill he would propose it. He also said liquor helped the founding fathers so it might help us get something together. Haha
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:55:56
That may take some time copy address if you would like to send more for now.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:06:14
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:31:54
It's fun and I really like the doge community. Also I don't consider it a shit coin.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:33:20
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:59:05
I have it because I like doge and I think it's hilarious.
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:15:03
Yes all transactions are taken care of through coinbase.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:21:01
Good idea. I will tell him to ask the higher ups but I don't think it will be a problem. He wasn't worried about it at least.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:18:39
 and I laminated them at fedex.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:19:48
I just got done meeting with the regional manager of costal community bank in Darrington, Wa. They are accepting fiat donations and they are going to put a bitcoin donation address on their website. I am also in the process of talking to redcross to see if they can help out. I will let you know when the address is available.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:38:36
go ahead and try all you can see is the public key.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:07:29
Ok, I will see what I can do. Much thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:25:05
That would be ideal but all attempts to contact coinbase and bit pay to set something up went unanswered.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:59:16
I am co-owner of the WAFL STOP Gourmet Belgium waffles in Bellingham washington and we accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:30:04
I'm not taking it seriously because the chances of my bank opening my box and cashing out my wallets is fucking astronomical.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:10:21
will do
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:26:22
Nope living dangerously.
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:52:56
Its not much now but its enough to play around with and who knows? Maybe one day .001 btc will buy you a hover board.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:26:02
its laminated so it wouldn't be that nice
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:38:06
It's in the comment.
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:27:14
There is no sticker on these Its laminated. But if you want to make these  go to bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Or if you want some like these I could send you some.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:25:39
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:18:46
It's the safest way to store coin in my opinion. Also the banks are keeping it safe and they don't even know it muahahaha!
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:24:05
Really? Dogecoin is very funny and it has made a lot of people money including myself.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:46:34
I will now use my btc to invest in warm coats and lead.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:31:10
I wish someone would of informed me about btc when I was younger. Just trying to spread the word.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:51:11
I heard him say it. Hope he is right.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:14:45
Trollin trollin trollin get them trollies trollin rawhide!
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:59:44
The mayors office is in the process of getting a site up and I am in contact with them. Would i just post an address on the site? or is there some kind of tibot or something?
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:28:10
Yeah I have the Ubuntu live cd and a offline computer/printer it's super easy.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:38:55
1- 24
2- Food truck owner
3- we accept bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:33:04
How would this be done?
@_date: 2014-04-17 08:30:19
Haha thanks dude!
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:52:29
Bitcoin isn't a currency so who cares. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:30:37
I bought it at inside bitcoin in NYC directly from the Titan guys. Im not sure about the availability.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:01:06
Rabble rabble rabble... duh banks er gunna take yur coins! er my gerd!!!
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:11:14
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:46:21
I am aware that banks have screwed people with boxes before but the number of satisfied customers with "safe" deposit boxes vs the number that have been screwed is dwarfed in comparision.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:36:10
I went to inside bitcoin today. It was awesome!
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:33:00
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:20:16
Does anyone know how I can adjust the Bitcoin donation button to accept more btc?
