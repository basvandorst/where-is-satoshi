I am glad you posted this, what I wanted to tell you is that you have to expect toxicity on this site, afterall this is reddit, a site that attracts toxic people, pencil neck hipsters, wierdos, daft nerds, pretty much all the bad part in a society you would imagine. The only reason why I post here from time to time is because there is some actual useful information if you cherry pick it and just the concept of the site is a easy to use easy to interact with community. Regarding what you said about bitcoin and the whole situation I agree with you completely, I was reading here about this whole bitcoin unlimited and how the whole thing would be split into core/classical/new or something along those lines and I wondered how the fuck is that going to help bitcoin become mainstream? Bitcoin for a brand new user is confusing enough to use safely as it is, adding all these ecosistems within bitcoin won't help it in any way shape or form. As for a future thought, stop taking what you read on reddit to the heart, here you just need to start with "X specialist here, bla bla bla bla bla bla " and you wont the gullible retards. Again don't let reddit change your views on bitcoin community or any community for that matter.

haven't tried them, I see the price is in pounds so I think this is UK only, again I'm from eastern europe, google play EUROPE cards say only a few western countries like france, germany, austria can redeem EUROPE cards, UK only with UK, US in dollars in US duuh, so I don't want to risk my money and get paperweight, just interested about the virtual debit card that can be loaded with bitcoin and no verifications for small ammounts 10-30 euros:
edit: confirmed giftoff google play cards are uk only

what does the "web" consists  for you, cuckeddit? besides this website I know of bitcointalk which I will join to learn more about bitcoin, but other than that I'm open for suggestions.

I don't know what the fuck you talkin about by " It's still expensive to add on more coin through these for now.", I live in Romania, a eastern europe country, we have hundreds of thousands of terminals from where we can buy bitcoin in all kinds of supermakets and small shops, we were one of the first countries to have not one but two robocoin atms, if we can do it, why cant the great country of fat and diabetes murica can't? It's like 4-5% comission for us too if thats what you meant
