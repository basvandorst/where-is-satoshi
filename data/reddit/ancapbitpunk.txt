He also said that eventually the blocksize should be increased. And even LN requires a blocksize increase.

Core claims it's more difficult to do

Ok so I have some BTC in Coinbase that I would like to move to my Ledger Nano S. Should I wait for Coinbase to implement Segwit as to not incur crazy high fees and not add to mempool congestion. Or should I just move my funds now? For all I know Coinbase could go bankrupt or never implement Segwit. Plus hacking on exchanges is a threat.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:32:28
No duh that's what this post is about
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:12:33
Not soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:37:07
Thank you! Amen. We could also boycott exchanges that aren't using Segwit and implement Graphene to shrink blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:07:18
I'm in full support of Segwit but at it's best it doesn't come close to VISA and neither does the block increase alone. Add the block increase and let's collectively push Coinbase to adopt Segwit. The two together should hold us over until the first major payment channel for LN arrives. But Bitcoin is big news NOW let's not miss this chance. Block size would eventually have to be raised even for the Lightning Network. Even Core admits this. We playing around with other people's money by dragging are feet with blocksize, segwit &amp; LN.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:47:59
Yeah I guess I'm not allowed to ask questions lol. Addressing problems here is like asking for the death penalty. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:29:40
Transactions should be mined based off of how long they waited. Do away with rising fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:06:06
Paying assloads to a couple miners isn't any more or less decentralized. Talking about what will come is pointless for the present situation. Nothing says in the future BCH can't adopt Segwit/LN or BTC can't adopt larger blocks. In the now BCH is more useful than BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:07:29
Honestly I'd invest lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:13:19
Segwit is what will lower the fees but less than 10% of the transactions are using it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:22:53
The difficulty increases monday
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:58:03
Bitcoin is DESIGNED to deflate! That's a main feature. The price is deluded by any means. A full coin would have to be worth hundreds of thousands more to support a global community on 21 million. Energy consumption is a problem. Core fixes problems.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:29:57
When all the worlld is watching too
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:43:17
Price is not rising. Alts are.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:42
Well it's showing that as long as we can't cheaply move it, it's not going to hold value. Hence the current move into altcoins. I literally have co-workers telling me they heard bitcoin can't transact and talking about Litecoin. They never talked about bitcoin before and now this is the mainstream opinion on it. So pissed the community couldn't come to an agreement to appease both sides and do what's best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:55:39
Exactly why we should stop suggesting Coinbase to new users.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:10:37
Upvote for humor. No apparently this is some sort of way to scale the blockchain by condensing blocks. Was presented at the scaling conference. Thought I'd ask around on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:30:10
Shared with r/btc even though they're downvoting me to hell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:45
Bitcoin is finally in the news I have co-workers talking about it and all they can talk about is "bitcoin is a bubble it can't even transact, high fees, litecoin is better, etc." Meanwhile the price is falling. Time is money. Bitcoin will never be money at this rate.

It cost me $40 to move my BTC to my Ledger Nano S. It cost me $0.04 to move my BCH. The tech is outdated not early.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:09:31
I'm in the same boat with anything I left on Coinbase. They claim by 2018 they'll offer Segwit support but who knows whether that will be too late. Everything else I have in a Ledger Nano S with Segwit or on exchanges with Segwit. Tempted to exchange the Coinbase to BCH on GDAX and send it out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:59:33
It's a currency a transaction is a transaction. No such thing as spam. If I want to move my money anwhere for whatever reason I should be able to.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:53:36
Exactly my point it's NOT healthy this ISN'T consensus
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:16:56
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:35:05
Wrong. There is no "we" the users. Miners are suppose to activate the BIPs. Core was threatening to hard fork (yes it would be a hardfork not a soft fork) if the miners didn't bend the knee. The miners bent the knee to get the 2MB blocksize increase included. Core than again threatened to follow a different chain if the miners reached consensus on Segwit2x. Miners panicked and majority support dropped from the threat. So apparently all that's needed is to threaten to reach this imaginary "consensus". Consensual my ass.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:26:34
I just sent my BCH to my Ledger Nano S. It cost me 4 cents.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:04:25
The sad thing is even with SegWit and LN the blocksize would still need to be increased. This entire thing could've and should've been avoided. On and off chain solutions never needed to be either/or. Can't have a store of value that has not usability, especially when anyone can create their own version of it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:53:32
A MB increase would HELP the Lightning Network NOT hurt it. Lightning is going to be the cheapest way to transact people WILL use it BUT the LN at the end of the day eventually adds the final transaction to the main chain. It is imperative this also remains cheap and inexpensive.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:29:24
It will increase transaction fees even further
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:12:21
Wrong. We went from 17% usage to less than 10% usage
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:52:40
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:12
redbelly blockchain handles 600,000 transactions a second. Visa handles 60,000, LN is too small by itself
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:09:14
BCH already has LN but they don't use it because the block size increase of 8mb is sufficient for ALL transactions
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:38:18
BCH has a workable LN without Segwit they just don't need it with block increases so no one uses it
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:37:07
Well bitcoin is slightly different than other currencies in that it will be around forever regardless of public opinion, someone will always have it. It's that technology that IS giving people belief in it. I think my problem with liquidity providers is they can be coerced by the government. And that WILL subtract from my belief that bitcoin is this untouchable store of wealth or currency.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:39:26
"big blockers" are the ones that passed this segwit nonsense to begin with. The deal was pass segwit get 2x but the tyrants at core dont respect the miners, who are a core piece to all of this, and labeled them as enemies. Even Satoshi in his whitepapers said to raise the block size however much it needed
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:42:18
I hope not. I hope whatever approach is taken stays within the spirit of Satoshi's whitepaper. We'll see I guess. Worse case there are other currencies but I rather like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:28:35
Shouldn't we work to decentralize it though? Like BTG does? Or PoS, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:19:12
because of ICOs
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:40:50
Yours.org developed a Lightning Network already
but are NOT using them on Bitcoin Cash, because fees on Bitcoin Cash are so low that they don't have to.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:10:22
if Blockstream and Core prevent block size increases you are not "free to partake or not partake" if both were allowed to simultaneously take place we could have a free market consensus. But I guess that's why altcoins exist.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:18:00
not necessarily, instead we are giving the market the choice to use either, BCH has an LN network, most choose not to use it though, that's free market capitalism
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:48:31
Isn't LN on litecoin already? What is this layer 3 nonsense. This group of Developers has too much control for a group that makes more promises than it delivers. There are already blockchains in development that complete far more transactions than VISA google the redbelly blockchain. Everyone is developing faster than Core.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:24:07
But the decentralized part is what's giving it value how will it keep value as an investment? It seems the best to be both.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:32:31
The issue is less about the fees and more about having liquidity providers, aren't you worried KYC and AML are going to be mandatory. Those nodes will be huge, easy to identify and coerce by the government.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:59:03
This is why bitcoin shouldn't have centralization :)
