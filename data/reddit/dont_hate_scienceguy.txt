Must find a way to encrypt lambo so they can't seized it...

And (surprise!) they have their own ICO.
Ironically, if they were to rate their own token as a scam, I might respect this rating system.

I think you can only transport $10k without issue. And yes, you have to declare it.

That wasn't just the crypto.

Prenup. You get all the crypto. She gets the dog or something.

Thanks for the link! Man. I appreciate that someone is doing this.   
I wish journalists got paid on accuracy - including predictions.

Finally. Somebody is asking the question I need answered.

Don't know much about VWX. But I might fomo in anyway...

It is about to get crazy. We are at the tail of a bull/bear flag. One way or another, it’s about to go nuts.

Makes me feel better about the Nobel Prize for Economics. The fact that they gave it to Krugman made me think it was something of a joke.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:45:58
Good explanation. Thanks for taking the time to write that.
@_date: 2018-10-03 02:50:47
I know.

Would love it if this is what bitcoin mining actually was. Actually, I do think there is potential for a farmville style game that mines crypto while you're 'growing' crops.  That way your crops actually have a salable value.  The downside is you would actually need to leave the game running on your computer all the time.

THIS! Most normies think Bitcoin is this stupid thing that buys drugs. They will listen to Warren Buffet and got 3X inverted on it.
I am not at all convinced that ETF's are good for crypto. Futures certainly didn't help us like we thought they would.

And even if you do start a company with the purpose of helping your employees (I know a guy who started a company specifically to employ ex-cons), it is still a risk and you still have to focus on being profitable, otherwise it fails and nobody is helped.

Do believe it's more like the internet in its infancy. Crypto will change things forever. But Compuserve, Aol and Webcrawler may be comparable to today's coins.

Do you guys think today counted as 'testing 5K' or no?
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:21:53
I don’t actually think that’s true. Look at Greece. Part of the reason they are screwed is because they use the euro and cannot deflate their currency to pay debts and remain competitive. A single currency would only solidify power in the hands of the few.

Where are you seeing this?

Don't worry, he'll be asking you how to buy in a week or two.
But seriously, next year when you're getting ready to shit on your boss's desk, save a little for his.
