Usually you don't want to keep your coins in those online wallets, except some spare change.
Online services have a long history of getting hacked or scamming their users. Coinbase might be one of the more secure services given it still has a clean sheet, anyway I'd recommend paperwallets for truly safe storage.
It all depends on how long you plan on holding your coins. If you're going to buy something with them tomorrow, a paperwallet might be inconvenient to store them for just a single day, but if you just want to store them it's the right thing. You can of course split your coins and put some in cold storage (paperwallet) and keep some on your PC/smartphone for spending.

Europe has super strict gun control / guns are mostly banned.

How do you explain that? Are you going to tell me Europeans are less aggressive? No, I'd wager it's just the legislation.

Buying some bitcoin would be a good idea for russians who don't want to lose their wealth due to a dwindling rouble, but so would be buying USD or gold. 
Also, Russia is working hard on banning BTC and the likes so the russian BTC market is going to stay underground and therefore might never reach a significant amount of russians.
So while bitcoin might be a great answer to current troubles for many people in russia, they could be left standing on the sidelines again due to their oppressive government.

I don't get why anyone is still falling for this but it fucking works every time. 
You make some big promises, use some fancy vocabulary and boom people will throw their money at you without seeing any product or anything tangible at all. 
Maybe I just don't get it, but I don't feel good about this at all.

Well I'm no lawyer but if you stop withdrawals and buy on your own exchange to make a profit off the panic you incited yourself, that's a scam and I don't think it's legal.

You are right about people judging value differently, I might have been a little harsh, still it isn't just about that. 
A professional athlete uses all his available time to train and work on his skills, then he goes out and entertains all the spectators. They are willing to pay for that.
As inventor, you find ways to make peoples lives easier. Therefore your inventions (like Bitcoin) usually create value.
I guess if you use your time and wits to find ways to create value that's just fine. But in order to gain that much, I figure you will have to somehow create *immense* value. 
Just by transacting? I mean just by using a payment system to do transactions with random people around the world you expect to earn $100.000+? Well go ahead, I won't stop you but this sounds insane to me.
Interestingly though, by making it to those $100.000 you might be able to prove all the haters wrong as you can show them all the transactions and the value you created with them. I just don't believe it's going to happen, at least not that fast, or that smoothly.

I think they just hold your fiat and trade on the fly for you, there's no risk for them and they can take a cut of your purchases.
The customer gets to use BTC risk-free too. Looks promising to me.

Currently the entire value of every BTC in existence should amount to about $10bn. 
There are only about 100 people with a net worth above $10bn: 
I wager most of them don't have $10bn flexible cash.
Still you are right, those mainstream players will be a part of BTC no matter what. They can afford it.

I don't want to be a jerk but I don't get this project at all.
You want to get a house out of $0.35?
Let's assume you get a house for $100.000 just to have a number to work with. Now I can't imagine how you plan to generate that kind of value out of nothing but "fair" transactions. 
If it was so easy to do some simple international transactions and get $100.000, everyone would do it. 
You will have to rely on people giving you stuff or doing work for free. Those transactions will leave them with less than they had before (now that's what I call getting scammed)
I mean how else would you gain anything?
If you were to trade your shoes for their current value of let's say $20 you wouldn't gain anything as you would have to give away your shoes for the transaction to be fair. So you either have to sell them for more than their current value, or use some other way to "augment" their value. Maybe draw something onto them with a sharpie. 
To be fair, if people are willing to pay money for something like that of course it's no scam. 
Sorry but I can only see some guy who wants a (nearly) free house.
I hope I'm wrong.

They have some means to influence bitcoins growth, but the way bitcoin is structured they can't really control much without embracing it. Even if they can stop mass adoption, technophiles will always be able to use their favorite currency.
If you have BTC you can already do as you please, whether your local government allows it or not.
By banning it they just risk other countries getting ahead economically and financially.

Their PR is funny:

Yea those are the countries where a great many things would be looked at as a joke by the authorities, like police brutality or political imprisonment for starters.
Fraud will still be fraud in the countries where goverments are still elected by the people, doesn't matter if you cheat someone out of his candy or his bitcoin.
edit: the only reason I see for btc thieves not getting prosecuted is because there are no real ways to trace them that easily. But if you are a known business operating in a country where laws are enforced properly, you will be held accountable for any fraudulent acts you commit.

I don't get this at all. Correct me if I'm wrong but why do you need to crowdfund a crowdfunding platform?
What the fuck? Just put it out there already.
The idea of creating new coins for funding projects is a complete scam, you can crowdfund projects with bitcoin, no need for any additional coins. 
Check this: 
You are basically giving away $10m to some random guys with a fancy website. This looks like BitShares 2.0, yet another pyramid scam.
Some people are getting BURNED

Well they wouldn't auction something illegal or dangerous like seized drugs or weapons, so by auctioning those btc they would indeed make a statement imo.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:32:45
that would be illegal, still sounds plausible though
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:25:35
Trading volume shouldn't be measure in BTC as they are divisible (up do a point)
Volatility should decrease with increasing USD volume.
Hoarding doesn't matter too much I think. It probably drives the price a little, but that just means BTC will be divided further. You will always be able to buy some BTC just before using them to purchase something, even if it's just BTC 0.5 priced at $5000, no matter how many people are hoarding.

You just need the wallet on your PC with some BTC and you can "tip" quite easily. I don't see why you need a third party tipping service at all.

The question is how long will someone be doing it for free if there is a recognized way (popular website) to earn money through it?

Look, let's assume you bought those 10 BTC at $270. Now they enable withdrawals again. Most of the sell orders get pulled immediately as people realize they don't want to sell for $270 anymore. Price at gox skyrockets as people won't sell for much less than anywhere else (as long as withdrawals are working)
So, if you already bought at $270 you have no problem, after withdrawing you will be able to sell those btc anywhere for the current price of 600-700. Prices on other exchanges won't drop, why would anyone suddenly sell his btc for less? No reason, so it's not going to happen. The only reason you were able to get them for $270 in the first place was the withdrawal chaos, so after that's fixed the price won't stay that low. 
Now the big question is if they are ever going to fix it? People are obviously losing hope, else they wouldn't be willing to sell their btc for less than 50% of the current market price. I'd say it's a gamble, if you believe in gox you can get some cheap coins if you're right.
But who knows how far they're in the red? Also, they have to know they'll be losing a lot of customers as soon as they reopen withdrawals.

AFAIK just switching up a single character will usually void the whole address. You won't be able to send coins there as it's no correct address anymore. Therefore you won't lose any coins by mistyping a single letter.
I think this is pretty convenient tbh.

Of course people can buy tiny fractions to use for their transactions, that's the whole beauty of it.
But who decides the price of a fraction? The market.
Let's assume people are going to use it the way you imagine, cashing in and out tiny fractions while being unfazed by price drops and whatnot.
Now you can start estimating how many people are going to want those tiny fractions. My guess would be millions.
With those fractions being each worth some amount of $, you probably get a rather big amount of $ in daily transactions.
That's also why the total amount of BTC is important. With a finite number of BTC available, each BTC has to represent the value of all it's accumulated fractions. So if you have X people doing Y transactions for $Z per day, the price should represent that value.
You can't get your fraction of bitcoin without paying for it though, so somebody is "cashing out" his bitcoin holdings for you to be able to use bitcoin. With rising demand, price will increase, the fractions will probably become smaller.
So if I'm sitting on let's say 1 BTC, it's value will be determined by how many people are going to want a fraction of my BTC to use for their transactions. They won't be able to do any transactions without paying me or somebody else who is offering BTC.
Think about it, if price isn't increasing with adoption, some investor could just buy all available BTC and nobody would be able to use it anymore for transactions. He then could choose a price to sell BTC to the masses via his monopoly.
But bitcoin was open from the start, everyone could get in and stake his claim by risking an investment. Free market, no monopoly.
Obviously wild speculation could drive the price to bubble at some point, but that doesn't mean the actual value of a single bitcoin is random or negligible.

I always thought of the Financial Times as a high quality paper but that's just sad..
Also, reading the comments there makes me realize how the media is still failing at educating people. Well, how could they if their journalists themselves don't understand the subject. 
They make it look like you have to trust some shady internet people with your money. At no point you will have to do that though. Actually with banks you have to trust those institutions with your money, with bitcoin you just have to believe in the security of Public-key cryptography. 
But they don't know about that, so they don't trust it.
They don't know why it's a good thing the governments have no real control. Government backing comes at a price, they get the power to devalue your money by printing more for themselves.
They don't know anything about the block-chain itself, how it's not really anonymous at all, how it prevents double-spending and whatnot. 
Anyway there's such a big gaping hole of missing knowledge I have a hard time not feeling frustrated.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:54:13
There are pretty safe exchanges which are frequented by a huge amount of traders. What's your excuse for not using a known exchange? Probably greed - you wanted to get a better price? I'm just guessing here.
Getting your account locked is another flag. Those payment providers like paypal and neteller have a history of locking accounts for various reasons. Sometimes they get unlocked, sometimes they don't. Either way without the ability to withdraw you should've stopped trading. It's about minimizing your risk to a single trade. You paid a huge amount of money for this lesson and, don't get me wrong, I don't think that's fair at all, but that's what happened.
I'm sorry but to me this whole thing looks pretty bad. I wouldn't know what to do either, except trace the bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:38:03
Bitcoin offers pretty secure and more importantly free financial services to everyone on the planet.
How did paypal become so big? People started using it to buy and sell stuff.
It's the same with bitcoin, only there is no company behind it.
Is this a good thing? I don't know, I guess it is.
There will be companies promoting bitcoin though, which should help getting it appreciated.

Banks are maximizing profit and those fees are unreasonably high just because they can get away with it. There is no competition offering smaller fees, yet.
It would be wrong of them not to squeeze the highest possible fees out of their poor small business entrepeneurs, as they are obliged to maximize profits, doesn't matter if it's right or wrong.
Now if BTC comes along offering less fees/problems, they either have to offer premium service for premium fees or reduce those fees so they won't lose customers.
(Also bank tellers will lose their jobs due to nobody coming to complain about fees anymore. JK.)
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:45:55
So it's not going to reach 100k because you subjectively feel like the price is hefty already.. 
That totally makes sense, you are predicting the bitcoin market based on nothing but your subjective idea of what's a hefty price-tag.
The thing is if people use bitcoin as a currency, price won't really matter. If you buy bitcoins for let's say $100, you will be able to use those bitcoins to buy goods which are valued at $100, whether the price is at 1k or 10k or 100k doesn't matter at all.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:38:38
if you want to spend bitcoin you could just buy them at current value, even during a crash, and spend them right afterwards. there's even an app for that
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:23:02
So it's like the cloud is paying you to find flaws in BTC.
Sounds good.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:08:16
How would they regulate that?
If you are able to buy BTC on some exchange they can hardly control what you do with it afterwards.
It's just about their central bank not touching BTC for now.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:02:10
You're spot on. Although you have to acknowledge the possibility of bitcoin getting widely adopted, which would make it more than just another investment vehicle for the chinese. At some point it has to switch from artificial scarcity to real scarcity, as big holders cash out and the angry mob splits their coins into fractions to buy pizza with. Volatility should decrease with the increased use of bitcoin as a currency, price should increase. 
In that case the market would just need to grow at about the current bank-account interest rates for savings, for it to be a profitable investment for the general public. At some point growth could come to a halt as everyone who wants bitcoin already has some, that should be the long term price target.
By investing in bitcoin, I wager that a great many people will soon feel like buying bitcoin so they can use it as a currency. People who may not know of bitcoin yet. That's why I'd get my share of 21 Million BTC and their technological possibilities. 
It's still just a bet in the end. No magic, take it or leave it.
