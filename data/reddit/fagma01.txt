Bitcoin is imo a coin thats truly decentralized, strongest security and very censorship resistant: negative point is the high fees. I would see btc as a store of value whereas bch tries to be a medium of exchange (one of many others) there is really one coin that can be a store of value but many that tries to be a medium of exchange. In the long run, btc has a brighter future i think.

This site sumarise it perfectly: 
“In short, PSD2 enables bank customers, both consumers and businesses, to use third-party providers to manage their finances. In the near future, you may be using Facebook or Google to pay your bills, making P2P transfers and analyse your spending, while still having your money safely placed in your current bank account. Banks, however, are obligated to provide these third-party providers access to their customers’ accounts through open APIs (application program interface). This will enable third-parties to build financial services on top of banks’ data and infrastructure.”
What it could mean for bitcoin is for example that a party like coinbase acts as a TPP( third party
Provider) so buying/exchanging crypto is a smoother experience? Interesting topic to think
About indeed
