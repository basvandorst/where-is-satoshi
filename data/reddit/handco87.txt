What if you have never transferred any money into your bank account yet ? Always been on the exchange

So if I made a $100 into a $1000 on gdax this year. I’m suppose to report it even tho I haven’t touched that money yet ? It’s still on the exchange and I’m trading back and forth. Sometimes I’m at $1,200 sometimes I’m at $800 for instance.

If I transfer my bitcoins from my blockchain to my coinbase account, wait for the fork. Get the same amount of 2x coins. Then re send my original coins back to my blockchain and just hold my 2x in coinbase. Would this be ok ? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, they don't see that transaction even coming through. Definitely coinbase

Are my bitcoins safe on my blockchain wallet during the forks ?

Long story short, fuck it and invest more money ��!?

I don't gamble much, if I do. I want a big pay out lol. Finally got one ! I use Bovada to make bets. And now I'm chillin with 10 bit coins. At least it won't be an emotional roller coaster ride as the price goes up or down. End of the day only $1,000 was my money. So I'm either gonna make a shit load of money or lose a $1,000. Letssssss see

Someone who bet $1,700 on a draw for the GGG Vs Canelo fight in Sept 2017, won $27,000. Played some black jack online and turned it into $35,000 and found out about Bitcoin because that’s the fastest way I’d get my money, as I cashed out bitcoin starts taking off so I leave it in there, turned it into to 6 figures, cashed out at 19’800ish and the rest is history ��
