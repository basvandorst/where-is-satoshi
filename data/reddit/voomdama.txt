No but there is mass adoption of currencies backed by gold. The global access is a feature that provide value to bitcoin but it doesn't mean squat if no one accepts it. Right moe the only two things proping up the value are the investors dumping money in it and the possibility that it might replace existing currencies.

Part of driving the price up requires the attitude of the market to be in favor of buying. I am trying to judge the attitude of market so I can limit my risk.

I am interested but I am trying understand the downside and upside to such an investment.

I am not saying it doesn't have value but unlike traditional currencies it is not backed by any bank, government, or asset. That makes it difficult to do valuations on what the currency could be worth. If there was a mass adoption of it in commerce, then there could be a means to perform a valuation but that will be an uphill battle.

Cramer is cautious about bitcoin because he doesn't have any means to perform valuations on bitcoin compared to a traditional currency.  He preaches about researching investments before putting money into them. Cramer started as a broke journalist living in his car and became a rich hedge fund manager so he must ne doing something right. He is most famous for his "They know nothing" call before the recession. 
Most price targets have been guesswork. Remember when 10k sounded crazy high? As long people continue to dump money into this, the sky is the limit. Just remember that no investment goes up forever.

Right now there is no way to run valuations on bitcoin because it is not back by any government or asset.  Since it can devided many times, any one can invest at any level so we have a lot of money coming into it. This is driving value sky high. Eventually money will slow down and investments will be cashed out. Til then welcome to capitol gains city.

Since it is a hot area right now, more speculators and volatility.
