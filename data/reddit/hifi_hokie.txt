Perhaps not ironically, both the Civil War and WWI were made far, far worse from idiots like that one who didn't realize the weaponry had outpaced the tactics.

No, 9/10 bad would be Black Monday/Tuesday of '29, when the DJIA fell 23% over two days. Or the Monday in '87 when it did that in one day.
4% is bad, but not even enough to set off automated 15min pauses.
Points are sort of useless comparisons, because the volume has changed so much - the Dow regularly moves more points in a day now than the entire index was in 1929. CNN needs something to say, though?
