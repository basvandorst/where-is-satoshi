Price would be much much higher now if a dynamic block size is implemented.
small blocks = small price
@_date: 2016-08-21 18:42:31
Old one, but always current!
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:00:26
Sure, with BS like "SegWit is an increase." 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:22:04


@_date: 2016-08-28 16:36:59
That happens because the blocks are so small that fees will rise and rise until only big entities can affront to pay them and everybody else will be forced to a side-chain.
@_date: 2016-08-31 23:52:48
It won't be "slightly" not that convenient and more expensive.
It will be price prohibitive to use the main blockchain, that kill so many posible applications that can be done with it, that is why lots of projects are migrating to other chains.
Also most people won't even own Bitcoin, they will own tokens on a side-chain, but not Bitcoin.
That is what bothers me. :(
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:04:51
I guess webmasters could be able to host the download pages on their websites, paying the download fee to the network, and use banner ads to monetize the traffic to offset the cost and make money.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:49:30
Sure, no problem, go to:
Specially how Satoshi said Limit will be removed later
That in combination with the Bitcoin Whitepaper, where no limit is mentioned: 
Proves my point that is a temporary solucion to limit SPAM, meant to be removed at a latter time and was never intended to be part of the protocol.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:42:53
I mostly see people not happy with high fees and long time unconfirmed transactions.
Is unfortunately how people in this sub do not realizes what Bitcoin Protocol could end up like Gopher if block limit is keep at 1MB.
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:55:56
I totally agree with Roger, Bitcoin will become the next MySpace, with 1mb blocks, the bitcoin blockchain is not attractive to develop apps... most coolest things will go to other alt-coins.
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:43:42

@_date: 2016-08-30 22:24:20
I love second layers, I just don't want to be forced to use a second layer because if the first one is full or unaffordable.
I want both layers to compete for user transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:58:09


ummmm.... too much if, maybe and so on... not even a clear date, don't think they even intend to do it.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:51:03


Refuse to even talk about a block size increase and make a temporary spam solucion (1mb cap) permant is not proof enough?
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:58:52
Thanks for your response! Is greatly appreciated!
I am unhappy with 1.8MB only if I upgrade to SegWit, I want the option to choose, not be forced to a second layer.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:18:52
That is amazing! Well done BitPay!
@_date: 2016-08-30 04:41:29
Satoshi said that increase should be made on the main code and note in a patch.
    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
       maxblocksize = largerlimit
With regards of the 21M Bitcoin, the paper clearly said:


And the predetermined number of coins has already been chosen.
If you think 1mb blocks are enough, is like when people in said 20mb Hard Drives &amp; 56k modems are more than enough.
Anyways, we all want Bitcoin to succeed, so why can we just find a middle ground solution?
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:50:26
I don't see anything in here:
But even if there is 2/4/8mb hard limits are not good for Bitcoin they will just create the whole deal again in a few years once we reach those limits.
Original Bitcoin Paper doesn't mention anything about limits to block size, soft limits are ok, but not hard ones.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:17:20
If you don't know how to prove it, changes are you are not Satoshi.

How would you call it if you are obligated to use the lightning network because you can not use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:17:55
Does anybody have a comparison of blockchain size with alt-coins like Litecoin or Ethereum?
@_date: 2015-12-31 22:15:48
Not at the moment, but you can easily integrate that functionality.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:21:18
You keep missing the point... been force to use the LN because of the lack of space in Bitcoin is the problem.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:58:33
BlockStream Devs don't care, since killing 0-conf transaction will lift their Lightning Network and give them the monopoly on that.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:14:59


I do care... I want to have direct access to the bitcoin blockchain, not thought a 3rd party Lightning network.
Both should be allow to compete hand-by-hand and the market will decide what to use.
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:16:14
The centralization argument is a lie... you Bitcoin will even more decentralize with Bigger block.
Actualy small blocks are going to keep Bitcoin mining power centralized in China.
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:28:10
The problem with is the censorship.
@_date: 2015-06-29 02:40:11
Lightning Network doesn't yet exist! Is just a white paper!
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:44:00
Yes, I moved to (is uncensored) a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:58:59
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:47:54
I think there is not, but since the increase is so little, I am afraid we will touch the hard limit in the future again and again.
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:29:37
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:10:19
Most of the big exchanges and services are in favor of increasing the blockchain size, so I don't think that would be a problem.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:15:56
Lighnting Network is not an scaling alternative, until is not fully functional and tested for at least a few years.
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:09:44
My point is that for the final consumer, that "piece" should not be a whole Bitcoin, but a bit or satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:14:57
A network is decentralized when everybody can participate with without permission.
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:29:09
It's amazing to see how bots are down voting this post to 0 every time... censorship has gone crazy!
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:18:41
Unfortunately, there is no space for robots in the Bitcoin Blockchain. 1MB is not even enough for humans, so I am afraid they will need to go to another chain with this stupid size limit.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:57:04
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:11:14
I think is irresponsible to relay on a non-tested and just released software to scale Bitcoin.
This can NOT be the ONLY alternative.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:50:27
I also don't think is a good idea to give miner 100% control over block size limit.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:48:36
You run a node because you don't want to trust on a 3rd party, isn't that an incentive in it self?
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:51:02
At the risk of getting the malicious block refused by most of the network and eventually orphaned.
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:27:55
Just send an Invoice in your local currency with the seller information on it... don't over complicate.

@_date: 2015-12-05 18:19:06

I am sure they will have their own nodes as well, they can't just trust thirst parties.
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:13:02
The problem with the 2-4-8 approach is that in 12 years 8MB is going to be even worst that 1MB is today, and making a change on the protocol then, it will be even harder that it is today.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:27:19
So let me see if I understand, there is a problem of Mining Centralization in China, but if we increase the block size, they will loss their edge, but increasing the block size will create mining centralization!? I don't get it!

"If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry." Satoshi

I was tacking specifically about 0-conf transactions.


Yes it is.
**Monopoly Definition**: *the exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service.*
In this case, that you are forced to exclusively use the LN if you need 0-conf transactions, since you can not use Bitcoin for that case use.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:59:13
Honestly, I think the madness comes from nullc
I am in favor of bigger block, and against making the blockchain inaccesible to most people.
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:47:30


If miner refuse the transaction and the block, nothing will happen.
Miners can do that... they can select what transactions do they include in blocks and also what blocks are valid and which are not.

I guess it could be a GovCoin where supply is controlled by the Government, but if they want to keep a blockchain going, they will have to restrict the creation of my blocks to banking partners and reward them per each block found.

If you are non technical my suggestion is:
1) Buy a Cheap Netbook to use it only to Store BTC
2) Install ONLY ( And just only ) a light client. Ex: 
3) Move your funds there.
4) Backup your Wallet in a clean USB Drive ( Edited Thanks for the suggestion! )
5) Turn the computer off &amp; keep it in a safe box
Again, if you only use it to store Bitcoin, make sure you don't browse the internet or install any other software that may be a virus that steal your coins.
I think with that you will be much better off than with Coinbase.

I don't agree! I think network still can be decentralized, even if nodes require to a modest server to run.
Almost anybody can go to  for example, and for $25 a month get a full remote PC that can run a full node with no problem.
I don't think not been able to run on slow home internet connection, means centralized.
Also, with the evolution of cloud computing in a few years, most people will have their computers on the cloud anyways.

No need to ask, they can not find consensus because core is not willing to hard fork to increase the block size. Big Blocker already went from 20MB to 8MB to 4MB to 2MB and Core still firm on their position.

@_date: 2016-01-01 09:51:02
Gavin is proposing a time-to-verify limit so basically if your transaction takes more than X seconds to verify is disregarded.

That is my point exactly, the Lightning Network is not the Bitcoin Network.
So when people claim that a **different network will be use to scale the Bitcoin Network** is just a plain lie, since the **Bitcoin Network won't be scaled** it will be forced to stay at 1MB for ever, they are just offloading some transactions to a different network... which is fine, but that is not Bitcoin.
We want on-chain + off-chain scaling... not killing the Bitcoin Network by making it slow &amp; clogged so people are forced to other networks.

Anyways, 95% seams to be in favor of increasing the block size, so I don't really get what is the big deal!
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:45:25


So what you are saying is that a 4MB is not safe?
    /** The maximum allowed weight for a block, see BIP 141 (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 4000000;
See [Source Code in GitHub] (
So why did Core seated that limit if is not safe? 
Even if it is a waste of money for miners, an attacker can still generate one of suck blocks right?


Blocks won't go to 4MB overnight, as happened before, we can still set soft limits and slowly increase them.
Look, we disagree in our view, but we all want Bitcoin to succeed, right?
I am involve in Bitcoin for almost 5 years now, and more than anything want Bitcoin to be used by everybody.
Please understand, that **all we want is a bigger blocks, but with the current Bitcoin protocol, not another protocol**. We see where this project is coming and we don't like it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:23:59
The Lightning Network is not the Bitcoin Network.
We like to scale the Bitcoin Network, not other networks.
Of course other networks will need to growth on top to provide improvements to the users, but you can not claim that another network will scale the bitcoin network. It may help reduce load on the main chain, but that is all.

That is the right message, hear both sides of the issue and make your own mind.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:46:41
I won't answer personal attacks, since are irrelevant to the issue.
1) Even Core supporters agree that SegWit do not change base block size. "Segwit it can be a maximum of 4MB (**1MB base + 3MB witness**)" Source 
2) Yes, and that is good. BU also implemented something similar... with this implementation block propagation is not an issue any more.
3) In my opinion is a great solution, since incentivize miner to not put too many transactions in their blocks, pushing transactions to second layers.


They implemented SegWit that can generate blocks as big as 4Mb, which it means that they are ok with that size.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:22:52
You are contradicting yourself then.

@_date: 2017-03-05 05:49:04
Does that means that Core will accept up to 4MB Blocks? Even if they don't have any Witness data?
Can you please point to the Source Code where this happens?

What is traditional consensus?
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:21:19
I am sorry, but we had been scaling on-chain for the last 8 years, from 100kb to 250kb to 500kb to 750kb, etc and it worked perfectly.
1) Slowly increasing the real base **block size** limit
2) **Compact Blocks** to fix propagation time
3) **Parallel Validation** to fix quadratic growth in signature hashing
If we do all this + 4Mb Block ( Which even Core said is safe to do ) we will be safely scaling on-chain as we been doing from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:19:50
In case their are bundle, wouldn't that make Core way more complex and hard to maintain?
In case they are not, people who like to make transactions on the LN, will need to run 2 softwares (full bitcoin node + LN client) to send payments? 
So we are making it more difficult for users, right? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:03:22
No, but that is the biggest misconception Core supporters have against BU supporters.
We are not against off-chain solutions like LN, by the contrary, we want lots of them to scale to a billion users, but do not like to choke on-chain growth.
"Bitcoin Subchains" for example, is an great proposal to increase Bitcoin capacity. ( Search for it on Google, I can't post the link here or my comment will be deleted )
Again, **Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**
**It is not a payment settlement system for intermediaries**. With Core's roadmap, average users get priced out and have to rely on intermediaries to move value. **We would create new banks!**
It is all about scaling on-chain. Core's refusal for years to make modest changes to the block size created this mess of confirmation delays and skyrocketing fees. **Bitcoin was supposed to be a fast and cheap P2P electronic cash system for everyone on this planet**. It all happened with Blockstream's foundation and their push to move the bulk of transactions, new use cases and their business model off-chain. Colored coin companies created wonderful use cases on-chain, which increased the value of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, we have **no guarantee by Core**, its allies (Blockstream, BitFury and BTCC) and minions (Henry, Tone, Panda, Samsung) would support **a block size increase in the future**. They love fee-markets and payment channels in the future would also fight to settle on-chain. 
Satoshi itself stated that **free transactions should be possible** until the reward is not sustainable. Heck, the block reward dries up in 2140. And that is what we signed up for years ago.
IMO, all bitcoin users should have the ability to make **direct permissionless** Bitcoin transactions. Technology is evolving, BU is evolving. **What Core is doing is not in the spirit of Bitcoin**.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:52:46


That should be good then, there you have an incentive to keep the main chain as small as possible and move transactions off-chain.
**How is that bad? Specially for small-blockers?**


That is not true, it fixes it for SegWit transactions, not for all the transactions.

If not, how will I receive Lighting Network Gemini withdraws on my node?
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:36:29
Honest miners will follow the majority consensus, which is represented by the longest chain, **which required the greatest amount of effort to produce**. As simple as that.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:35:10
So you don't get your feature blocked by a minority group.
In an event of hard fork, not many miners will risk to stay on the minority chain and it will most likely die.
Also, Litecoin is requiring 75% hash power to active SegWit on their network, so let see how that goes.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:30:28
I also realized that **having only one Bitcoin client ( either Core or BU ) is great weakness for the network**.
As happened before with mining, we need several Bitcoin clients implementations to make sure the system is really distributed and has no single point of failure.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:32:51
We are not blocking anything... 75% of the network is not in favor of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:21:47
Lately I been trying to repeat this as much as I can: "The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, **which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it**." as Satoshi says on the White Paper.
Why? Because is not just the "longest chain" the valid chain, is the one has the **greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it**.
If the minority tried to manually re-adjust the difficulty, as they said they will, even when they may be the longest chain, they will not satisfied this part of the definition.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:13:08
I think it was $75 million what bankers pay to attack the original chain, not $100.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:08:58
That is a good point... a while ago it was this discussion of making Core simpler and [decouple wallet from bitcoin core] ( to simplify the code.
That seems a little too much to have every second layer on the Bitcoin Core implementation. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:23:21
Full Nodes are already rewarded with the "trustless" feature, something you don't have when you don't run a full node. It's a paid feature and you pay it maintaining a Full Node.
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:32:09


I don't agree with that... even Core admitted that we can have 4MB blocks today and the network will safety support it.
We won't need 1GB blocks, because a lot of the volume will be offload to 2nd layers, a lot of them, not just a monopolized network.
It will take years to reach 100Mb Blocks, but when we do, 10GB/s will be the norm and with improvements like Compact Blocks it won't be so much of a deal.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:48:50
Ok thanks, will review it.
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:13:45
Second layers should be chosen because they are cheaper and faster, not forced on users because of lack of space on the block chain.
Main chain should be allowed to grown, you can not have a healthy 2nd layer, if you first layer is slow and clogged.
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:30:23
Ummm yes, extrange! Maybe somebody who likes the blockchain to stay small with only 3 transactions per second... they like to cut the Stream of Blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:06:41
That is exactly my point, we can not censure today future inovation!
1MB in 20 year is going to be like 1Kb today, so forcing the blockchain to be limited to 1Mb (or 2, 5 or 8Mb) is crazy!
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:48:59
Is not for the Bitcoin Network, is for the BU client implementation.
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:20:20
For the record he said it on 24 December 2012, right when everybody were in favor of increasing the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:03:07
Does that means that my withdraw from Gemini will be on the Lighting Network or in the Bitcoin Network?
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:40:38
No I am not, so what you said is that they still will use the main chain, but the transactions will be in SegWit transactions format, correct?

I think there is a misconception of what decentralization means... 
Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.
The internet is decentralised and most users don't need to run servers on their computer/phones.

"At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would  only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node." Satoshi Nakamoto

@_date: 2016-12-13 15:21:29
I agree... Core developers could listen a bit more, instead of trying to block the increase of the block limit for their ideological/personal gain reasons.

What about client decentralization?
Do you remember when only one browser existed?
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:49:15
Miner can just signal on each block the maximum block size they are willing to accept.
Once a certain % of consensus is reach over an X number of blocks, any miner can fell confident a bigger block will be accepted by the majority of the network.
I think is a simple an effective way to do it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:14:47
I completely agree... my point was that in other to support suck a network you need a solid foundation.

@_date: 2016-11-05 15:32:21
Sorry, but I don't agree with you...
And most important, I am not the one been fooled, I can make my own mind.
Most likely, I was coding Bitcoin way before you (if you code at all) and I have a clear technical understanding of how it works.
CPU + Storage + Bandwidth grow every year... so your arguments "technical" costs are not really valid.
Average website last year was 2MB (  ) so honestly limiting Bitcoin Block to 1MB forever is the same of killing it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:56:40
Transactions that need faster confirmation times ( the 10 minutes wait issue ) and lower fees will naturally migrate to a second layer once reliable alternatives are available.
Keeping the block small to force people onto unproven 2nd layer solution is irresponsable and dangerous.
People should chose a second layer not be forced to it. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:22:18


I don't think I am... my definition was extracted right from Wikipedia 


The only reason why is not decentralized today is because people build 2nd layers ( DNS for example ) that allowed a small group of individuals to control it.


Agree... and I am afraid that this could also happen to Bitcoin is we allow centralization in ANY of it parts.
Right now Mining/Nodes/Exchanges/Wallets are Decentralized, but Client Development &amp; Protocol are not.

not very clear and uncertain pseudo block size increase via hacky/complicated way to make sure the change is a forced-soft-fork do not count.
We want Real Base Block Size increase... with a clean hard fork.
If is a dynamic cap much much better.
But again, I lost all my confident in Core as well and really miss the good old time where Gavin and Jeff where the ones in charge. :(

Yes, I understand.. but you can always limit the number of connections to reduce the bandwidth.
Also improvements for Xthin blocks, can help you reduce the amount of bandwidth.

Of course they can handle that as well...

@_date: 2016-11-01 19:48:49


I think is the other way around, small blockers should really be more open or this discussion will go forever.
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:51:21
And also will enable all sort of 2nd Layer Apps like the LN and Side Chains... so most likely Core will push that way, killing any options for on-chain scaling ever, so we will stuck with small block forever.

Sorry to tell you that unfortunately the community is not united, and the reason you don't hear much is because most people who think different are been banned from telling their real opinions in this sub.

Are two statements specifically talking negatively about @_date: 2016-12-08 01:10:28
The point is that there IS a benefit for running a full node.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:13:36
But but Core told me!! Ohhh.
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:00:29
Yes, but in the meantime we need more space on the main chain, we can not force people to unproven 2nd layer solutions.

Is not that people don't want it, we also want on-chain scaling ( bigger blocks ) and some people is afraid that once SegWit activates, we will be stuck forever with 1MB Blocks. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:17:13
When you talk about another person, you are saying more about you, than the other person.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:52:10
Not today, but in 20 years the bandwidth, space and cpu power will easily handle millions of transactions.
Your cell phone has more computing power than NASA circa 1969
I agree most small value transactions should be on a second layer, mostly because of the need of instant confirmation, but do not agree with leaving 1MB Blocks forever as it seams is happening now.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:49:00


So you are saying that the market is not capable to decide on his own?
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:14:06
As contrary as people think, big blockers are not against off-chain scaling, we want both on-chain and off-chain, but they should be allow to compite freely for consumer transactions not be forced upon us.
Off-chain solutions can include features like:
* Lower Fees
* Faster Confirmation Times
* Anonymous Transactions
* Non-Structured Data Layer
Only with those 4 features off-chain transactions can attract a huge amount of users, freeing the main block-chain of the useless data that you mention.
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:10:17
Bitcoin is just a protocol
And FYI, I am not religious so don't get why you keep bringing that up.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:22:50
Lightning network is a 2nd Layer, 2nd Layers are not Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:41:58


Yes, that is what I believe as well... they will denied it now, but you will see that during the next few weeks/months they will not make any progress to increase the real block size ( base block ).
And once they finally "find" a solution, it will be some weir complex hack just to make sure that they can keep holding the blockchain hostage with a forced-soft-fork.
If you have some time, listen to this interview:
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:48:50


What about trustless? 
Today if you don't run a full node, you are trusting a 3rd party.
So in my opinion running a full node is the price you pay to not depend on a 3rd party to access the network.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:40:17
Transaction Fees, the higher they are the worst for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-16 21:15:55


Come on! Just because you need more hard drive and bandwidth to run a full node, doesn't mean is centralized!
Anybody will still been able to run a full node, just that we will need more disk space and a better connection.
I can't run a full node today with a dial-up connection and a 1gb hard drive, and that doesn't mean Bitcoin is centralized.

I am not saying they are not necessary, I do support the initiatives, what I do not support is making them almost mandatory by artificially limiting the space on the blockchain.
I want sidechains, lightning networks and the blockchain to compete freely.
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:52:29
Totally! I don't like miners to have 100% Control over Bitcoin, consensus should also be reach my wallets, exchanges, etc. for that reason I don't like BIP100. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:19:10
He is right do... BlockStream needs to keep the blockchain small so most people will have to use their gateways and pay fees to them.

The stars of the conference were the team from BitInstant.com. BitInstant.com provides people an easy way to purchase Bitcoins, a new virtual currency that is decentralized and transferred via a P2P model. They espoused the value of this new currency for gambling companies who are having trouble taking payments from markets like the United States and China where the restrictions on money flow are becoming more cumbersome. They spent much of their talk educating the audience on Bitcoins, it took a bit of time but you could see certain members of the audience could see the benefits of a currency. After their talk, which went well past their allotted time due to the high volume of questions from the audience, there was a line up of gambling and junket operators looking for more information. We have an in-depth interview with Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees of BitInstant.com coming soon.

"In government-controlled regions, they said, the Internet was available, but heavily controlled. Cybercafés had mandatory ID requirements, video cameras trained on screens and visitors, and keystroke loggers whose contents were collected daily by security personnel. At checkpoints, Assad forces were said to be visually checking laptops for programs like Tor and TrueCrypt that would allow users to get around the government controls."
Pretty scary!
@_date: 2012-08-11 17:31:27
I think we will see more and more of this defamatory things coming in the short future, the idea is as simple as use the words "Crime", "Money Laundry", "Ilegal Activities" and others together with "Bitcoin".
By doing this, the general public will have a pre-conception that Bitcoin is likend with these ilegal activities, and will be afraid to get into it.
But more important, these people will tell others, that Bitcoin is just something used for ilegal activities, which of course we know is not true.
@_date: 2012-09-10 08:33:39

They are from an old generation, and is hard for them to understand the concept... don't take that as they are not smart.
Unfortunately, as somebody points out, is imposible for your father to pay you the profit in 10 year time, not just because the price of Bitcoin will be much higher, simply because there is no way he can pay you the lessons you will earn by getting involved on Bitcoin so early, and is no way to tell where you will be in ten years with that experience.
When I was your age, I had the same argument about Internet Access... my father thought it was a SCAM from the phone companies to profit... I was able to convince him it was not, but that simple event changed my life, got into programming and today I am a successful internet entrepreneur.
That was the single event that changed my live and make me the person I am today, so that is why I think unfortunately there is no way he will be able to pay you back your losses. :(

Fees are a good thing, and keep the network running, just try to minimize them, but if you like your transactions to be process you will need to include an small fee. Think how much would it cost with PayPal for example... we are paying much much less for a way more efficient a reliable system, support it.

Just that a transaction is authorized by a fingerprint doesn't mean that your fingerprint will be public... on bitcoind you need to enter your password to decrypt your private key to autorize a transaction and that doesn't necessary make your password public.

Tiny, faint pulses of laser light are used in a bid to make single photons - the fundamental units of light - with a given alignment, or polarisation. Two different polarisations can act like the 0s and 1s of normal digital data, forming a means to share a cryptographic key.
What makes it secure is that once single photons have been observed, they are irrevocably changed. An eavesdropper trying to intercept the key would be found out.

And as far as I understand, the protocol will accept an increase on the decimals, so in case is necessary in the future, we can increase it to 10, 12 or 14 decimals to make it even more divisible.

I have a discussion with a friend on Facebook yesterday.
Are Sidechain tokens 'real' Bitcoins?
I think they are not, they are sidechain token that are exchangeables to Bitcoin in a de-centralized mater.
Even when 1 token on a sidechain could be backed by 1 bitcoin locked on the main chain, that token is not a 'real' bitcoin.
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:51:13
I actually think is the opposite, if Bitcoin turns into the vision of "high-fee and very few transactions", then very few miners will be around. If Bitcoin allows for all the transactions in the blockchain for a low-fee, then of course miners will stay.
@_date: 2012-10-05 18:42:40
I think you are refering to: 
But I think is tacked off context, he is talking about Bitcoin Exchanges been legalized so they are not target of Governments raids.
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:06:48
Why are you saying that?
We all know that with 1MB the blockchain it does support more than a few transactions per second... if we have VISA level transactions ( 2000 transactions per second ) where do you think they will go... to a second layer... right?
Right now there is a lot of people who own Bitcoin that never even touched the blockchain ( stored on a Exchange or Wallet Service like Coinbase or Xapo )... that is a second layer, right?
Do this people own their coins if they don't control the Bitcoin Private Keys on the main Bitcoin Blockchain?
@_date: 2012-12-31 04:56:18
@_date: 2012-12-27 06:07:41
Could not be far from the truth! Today Bitcoin is way more mature and accepted than before.
@_date: 2016-09-14 21:38:46
Private keys control a number of coins that were originally generated via proof of work.
Once you move those coins to a second layer, you don't control them any more.

Any idea what this could be??
@_date: 2016-09-14 21:41:03
That is exactly my point! Not only that, you need to trust the LN code, in case of a bug or network rules changed by network admins ( The DAO changed the consensus rules is case you think this is not possible ), you may never be able to convert your LN token back into Bitcoin again.

Even when SW is great, still won't be enough to reach VISA level transactions. And if block limit never get increased, it will always be a very small amount of Txs you will be able to support on the main chain. Do you agree with this?

I guess most drug dealer &amp; criminals only accept US Dollars, so ilegal activities in US Dollars is millions times more than with bitcoin... but like always, they are trying to relate bitcoin &amp; ilegal activities in the mind of the regular person in order to justify future action again it.

Let's put it in another way then.
If we reach VISA levels ( 2,000 tps ) and only 28 of those can fit on the main blockchain ( Assuming a Theoretical full 4MB Blocks Capacity of SW ).
Do you agree that the other 1,972 transactions per second need to happen on a secondary layer?
@_date: 2012-09-10 22:33:30
I think, that won't happened with out any kind of fee from the account holders... do you think people will be willing to pay a % of their balance per month in exchange of an insurance on their deposits?

Terrible video... they are only trying to discredit Bitcoin... Again, much more criminals accept US Dollars than Bitcoin, so I guess you can say the same about the US Dollar but multiplicated for 1.000.000 times or more.
@_date: 2016-09-24 20:41:55
They are attacking it now, if block limit stays at 1MB, bankers will monopolize the access to the blockchain and most people will be forced to use a bank owned sidechain instead.

Today the average website wight 2.5MB (  )
So loading 2 websites every 10 minutes not something it will kill decentralization.
Anyways block won't be 4MB overnight, will take some time to reach that limit.
If you bring up the CPU needed to validate signatures, transactions are validated when included on the mempool, so every transaction in the block that is already in the mempool don't need to be re-validated.
Anyways, I still don't understand the arguments for keeping the 1MB limit forever... can somebody explain them please?

No, access the main chain is what is important.
People should be able to still use it for payments, and not be forced to a second layer.
They can choose to use a 2nd layer, because is cheaper or faster, but the reason should not be that the main chain is cost prohibited and using a 2nd layer is their only option.

@_date: 2016-10-05 20:10:40
Amazing! Good god guys!
If understand correctly:
1) This transfer never touched the main chain ( was off-chain )
2) Only when the channel is closed, either party will receive the funds on the main bitcoin chain.
3) So these type of transactions only make sense if you expect to do lots of back and forward transactions between the 2 parties, but not to buy a "cup of coffee".
Are these statements correct?
@_date: 2016-10-21 01:37:31
What I read on the agreement is "code" not "implementation proposal"

Can we just change how the database manage the UTXOs?
Most people don't need to have them on memory all the time, right?
This seams like a good analysis about that issue:
I think we should have a balance growth plan what contemplate on-chain and off-chain scaling... we need hundreds of off-chain ideas to compete freely for customer transactions, but that is just not possible with out making on-chain scaling and increasing the block size. Don't you think?

@_date: 2016-10-21 04:10:28
Ummm, I don't think so... the whole idea of the conference was to reach consensus... you don't need to read all the conversations, transcribed by who knows, the final and signed agreement is what it counts.

Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:36:49


FYI, the average website is now 2.5Mb
Was 1.7Mb in 2013 and 1.95Mb in 2014
And you say that we can not go over 1Mb blocks?
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:32:29
Yes, they are.
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:26:06
I think both are important on-chain and off-chain, neglect either of those and we won't do so well.
If you want instant transactions ( less than 10 minutes confirmation ) an off-chain option will be the ideal.
If you like a very secure transaction, on-chain is the best option.
Artificially limiting either of those options will be bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-25 01:58:39


@_date: 2015-10-12 23:48:10
You are right! Sorry!
@_date: 2016-10-26 03:49:42
It's already full, paying more fee doesn't change that...
For every transaction that somebody pays "more" another do not make it inside the block, remember that.
We can support up to 4MB blocks today and the system will still be a censorship-resistant value transfer system.
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:55:03
So you think Satoshi created for Central Bankers?
I don't think that was his vision at all, unfortunately with 1mb blocks this is our fait.

@_date: 2016-07-11 20:27:23
I believe it will be with fractional reserve side chains.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:57:07
This limits the access to the blockchain, so regular people will only have access to the second layers but never to the main chain.
In my opinion this will bring upper layers with fractional reserve eventually, so banks will once again been able to control the issuing of currency.
Most people will accept it, because they never even have the option to interact with the real bitcoin blockchain, so for them it will be the norm.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:47:07
Agree, with compact blocks their arguments are not valid.


For that exact reason, you can now go to up to 50MB blocks and compact blocks will be transmitted at 1MB.
Clarification: I am not saying we should go to 50MB, in my opinion a FlexCaps with a 2MB or 4MB soft limit is the best option, with compact blocks that will be 40kb to 80kb at the most.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:51:43


segwit is second layer, nothing to do with block size
@_date: 2016-07-20 06:29:58
Fractional Reserve Side Chains
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:28:03
Doesn't make any sense... 1MB is not the ideal size for right now... We need at least 2MB
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:15:49
I do not agree with the article... even if we increase the block limit to 8MB we won't have 8MB blocks overnight.
It will take Bitcoin at least 10 to 20 year to be up to VISA Level, not all the transactions will be on chain and by then we will have 400 terabytes in any regular mobile phone.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:58:02
Can somebody explain, how is this actually possible with 1MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:30:18
| If the rules of Bitcoin are easy to change, then Bitcoin doesn't really have any solid rules, and then what's Bitcoin's value?
I see not block size limit on the original bitcoin white paper, why should we allow that change?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:18:18
I agree with the Block Size increase... specially with the dynamic limit proposed by Gavin.
Specially, since the limit was a hard code path Satoshi did to prevent a possible overflow attack in the early days, but specifically indicated that the limit should be removed latter.
@_date: 2013-05-25 00:53:09
I Agree, also It's a pay-per-use "open" protocol. Even if they Open Source it, everything you develop for it, your users will still have to pay a fee to OpenCoin Inc. to use it. I'm looking forward to see an alternative implementation, that is really Open Source and without a single point of control.
@_date: 2013-02-13 18:58:41
That is not what "provably fair" means... provably fair means that there is no way the operator can cheat when picking the winning numbers. Because the numbers are not random, but based on an mathematical algoritm that can be verify for any third party.

In simple terms, miners build the block chain, they get a reward for each new valid block they create. With more miners (hashrate), the network becomes more secure, making much more difficult to execute a 51% attack to alter the rules of the network and create invalid blocks.

Depends, but assuming BTC-E requires 6 confirmation, I will say 2 hours at the most, if you paid a tx fee, and 2 to 6 hours if you didn't. Assuming one block is discovered every 10 minutes. That is the average, but it could be more.

The problem is that if you spend $600K in ASICs to do a 51% attack and you succeed. The price of the BTC will fall so much that won't pay the $600K back. Unfortunately that attach is only viable if you like to destroy Bitcoin.
That is why I think every Bitcoiner should have at least an small ASICs running, that will make it almost imposible to perpetuate a 51% attack.

Ask your government... why are they making it to hard for US Companies to even participate... several exchanges try to open up in the US and all of them closed because of the excessive regulation and no cooperation from financial institutions.
USA is going to be part of the third world is they keep up with this policy.

@_date: 2013-01-17 03:25:10
I don't think so... the Bitcoin economy has been growing a lot in 2012, we have much more services that accept BTCs... the more things you can do with Bitcoins more people will adopt it and that will make the price rise.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:37:14
I thought the same thing when bought some coins at $200, but then I realized that all the people I know don't even have a clue what Bitcoin is, and the few that do, never even got into Bitcoin... so I concluded that we are still very early on the game.

I think the answer is easier than you may imagine... just change the decimal point back 3 digits and we will read $1,000 in no time. Then change again the decimal point back 3 digits and we will reach $100K.
There is a psychological barrier, that is hard to cross... Bitcoin seams expensive compared to alternatives, when in reality is the cheapest one. That is why Ripple with only 0.02 per XRP has already twice the market cap of Bitcoin.

They only thing what could bring Bitcoin to $0 is a problem with the protocol itself, even if is ban by the United State ( which is the most possible problem Bitcoin will face ) it won't be ban in other countries, price will go down for sure... but it will continue to exist and grown. The world is much bigger that the USA.

My vote is for Mr Roger Ver alias "Bitcoin Jesus"

I doubt Satoshi will loss the private key of those generations. I think on time, they will move... and my prediction is that will be donated for a great cause.

Bitcoin is "Actual Money" what you like to use to buy them is not.
@_date: 2013-02-27 23:00:57
Yes, but that may still buy you just an ice cream.

The psychological factor is important... 1 XRP is trading at $0.02, sounds cheap right? Well, since there are 100 Billions XRP, the price is about same as Bitcoin today. So if we can get exchanges to talk in mBTC and price becomes $0.13 instead of $130 it will be a great thing for Bitcoin.
