I was thinking about this recently too. In addition to insurance, I think another factor is how easy it would be to identify anyone who got in to your account and took money. They'd have to wire it to another account (with credentials tied to it.)
A bitcoin account break-in is more dangerous since the money can be transferred out and the destination address doesn't really tell you anything too useful.

Dropbox has an option to enable 2-factor, but I don't think it's turned on by default.

Google Authenticator codes do NOT get backed up by iCloud or iTunes backups. I just got a new phone, and after restoring from my backup the Authenticator app is blank. This is probably the most secure behavior, but there's no warning (that I saw during casual use) to the user that everything won't be restored.
Authy has a backup system, and some nice logic behind how it works with multiple devices.

TL;DR rarely feels this appropriate.

I just bought it. The whole experience was fast and easy. I was surprised at how quickly the QR code got replaced by an order confirmed message.

I'd say having some of the dollar eaten up by inflation is part of the experiment.

Here's their tweet with the link:

That makes sense, and makes this feel a little less significant. Thanks for the heads up. (I hadn't seen the Techcrunch article.)
Still good to see Square working in the space, and they can still push what they've developed to work with Coinbase in to their mobile payment app.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:26:40
While this isn't for mobile Square apps yet it seems like they've figured out a back-end that converts the BTC to USD for the merchant, like Coinbase or Bitpay can do now. I'm guessing that they're adding Bitcoin support to their Square Market product first as a trial. If the back-end is done, it seems trivial to add support to their mobile payment system (What we all think of when we think of Square). 
I don't think it would require any additional hardware for the merchants since it's the purchaser that needs to scan a QR code to load the destination address. The merchant only needs to display the QR code on a screen, just as they present a screen now for a credit card signature.

I have to admit, this is fun to watch.

I'd say it costs more money to create physical products (especially electronic devices) in environmentally responsible ways.

None of the video player interface is working for me in Chrome (pause, volume, full screen).

Bitfloor has been flooded with 0.02 bids at all prices for a while now... I don't know if this is someone trying to dollar cost average, or some sort of DDOS technique.

No. And I can't get any response from their support e-mail on another matter, either.

Your Twitter comment really kills your credibility.

Even then, they could be the endpoints of the transaction, converting BTC back to the local currency for those who needed to spend outside of the BTC economy.

It seems a bit early to lawyer up to me.

I'd love to see them switch to something more relevant, like a mobile phone scanning a QR code at a shop.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:37:28
Are you promoting a currency, or a god? 
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:52:48
Exactly. I've been watching this relationship lately. It seems like when BTC/USD goes up, share values go down enough that everything stays 'about' equal when you calculate it back out to USD. Pretty interesting.

When I made a deposit yesterday the teller asked me what it was for. I told her it was a service for transferring money... but was honestly at a loss since I wasn't expecting to get challenged.

Crashed right as I was waiting for a deposit to hit. Damn!

Are all of the figures he's quoting world-wide or just in the US? They seem a bit low to be global totals.

It seems like mtgox and Bitfloor have been pretty in sync until yesterday. There was a pretty wide spread between the two today, but it looks like they're settling in on each other now. I've been wonder what kept Bitfloor so much higher. I know it's MUCH lower volume.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:37:20
Does anyone know a way to add a fee to BTC withdrawals from Bitfloor? I haven't been able to find anything, and my last withdrawal took a while to go through.
@_date: 2013-09-06 01:41:13
These are assumptions:
Banks offer something Bitcoin as a protocol cannot: credit. Banks will always have a role in lending money and charging interest for the service. I imagine their business model of holding and loaning fiat can adjust to also hold and loan virtual currencies. One difference, I think, is that bitcoin cannot be loaned without actually providing the quantity loaned. I'm guessing this would actually keep banks from becoming insolvent, since they wouldn't be able to loan more than they hold. That may be a reason to fight virtual currencies, but if they take off I think they'll just work them in to the existing mechanisms they use to profit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:21:50
Just a counter point... missing a few days of growth may cost you more than the 4% fee.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:08
You're confusing the regulation of the currency with the regulation of exchanges.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:37:22
I'm pretty new to all this, so forgive me if this is dull... but I've never seen the end of the asks before. Maybe it's just because the chart has had to scale out to cover the depth from 0 to the current price at halfway? I've just never seen it this lop-sided.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:38:23
To me, the point of this post is to show that another non-techy non-early-adopter saw the benefits of accepting bitcoin and took action to accept it. She just started, so it's impossible to say whether it has affected sales yet.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:17:12
I think what this story is saying is:
This guy in Germany is limited to withdrawing 100€ at a time right now, but his card usually lets him withdraw up to 20,000€ a day.
He's so anxious to get his money converted to BTC he stood in line 10 times today so he could buy 1,000€ in BTC, possibly from the OP.

When I try to log in, it says:
"No operations allowed after connection closed. Connection closed after inability to pick valid new connection during fail-over."
I think that's a MySQL error.

Of course... I don't notice that I haven't been getting Dropbox backups lately until the site goes down.

Yeah, someone linked me to their story about how Bitcoin is crashing. The article looked at a time span of a single day for evidence of a crash, then did nothing but talk about chatter on Reddit... even down to the 300 image.
@_date: 2013-07-25 14:59:11
If you keep reading that thread, you'll see he was just speculating on possible options. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:59:30
You'd have physically printed paper wallets, so your computer crashing wouldn't be an issue.
A fire or destruction/loss of the paper would be an issue, of course. You can print more than one copy and keep them in different secure locations.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:52:30
I wish they'd quit loading these stories up with photos of the physical coins. It's really confusing the issue for anyone who's reading about bitcoin for the first time.

The deposit only takes about 30 minutes the two times I've done it. It takes me longer to drive to the bank than it takes the cash to show up in my Bitfloor account.
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:31:52
Are they answering their support e-mail address for anyone? I've seen three e-mails over the last two weeks with no response.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:57:33
Well, I just put an ask in at $130 and the chart updated, so it's not a bug in the site. So there really just isn't anyone selling higher than $120 right now. I'm guessing that will change as more people log in for the day.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:46:02
Mine took about 2 hours, but did transfer.

It's great that they're using the full-size "Pay with Bitcoin" button in the store. Now I wonder if they'd add that button to the Bundle page too instead of the small text link.

Alex Jones cannot make money by promoting Bitcoin. It goes against the interest of his advertisers that sell gold. Alex Jones is just trying to make money by scaring people in to thinking they need the "survival" products he advertises.
