If you look at this post after you spend a weekend researching mining you will want to kill yourself because if how stupid this sounds. 
More constructively...
1. Anyone mining has the opportunity to or not to join or create a pool. A pool simply means all of your hardware is working together in such a manner that if one wins you all split the reward. 
2. The most "balls out machine" available is from bitmain and is a standalone asic miner. 
3. Since the miner is an asic, gpus are irrelevant. 
4. Have you looked at your energy costs vs the 1600w per machine?
5. Have you researched the actually necessary cooling for having multiple machines running. If your machines overheat they will be destroyed (no refund/return) and worthless even as parts. These run so hot the climate they run in can effect them (not keeping any miners alive in the Arizona summer for example)
6. Do you have 220v circuits installed in the location?
7. There are calculators out there to tell you an estimated return, but they are rough estimates since you will inevitably have downtime and the difficulty is ALWAYS rising on the longer scale and quite fast at that. 
8. By setting up a rig youll now have to make $225k before you even break even. 
Generally mining is not profitable at all if a) you dont already have an intimate understanding of it and b) you dont have basically unlimited resources to pour in as you figure out how to actually get making money. 
Buy 225k of btc and dont look at it for a decade.

I can 99.99% guarantee you dont generate enough solar to run a mining farm 24/7

If youre asking this question, shut down your mining rig

Lol, youre asking how to get a business to spend money for no direct benefit... not happening.

buy it and forget about it. $50 worth at these prices isnt gonna change your life

Why are transactions not advisable during the fork day?
