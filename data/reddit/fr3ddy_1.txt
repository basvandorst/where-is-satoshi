Try [Blockchain]( and link your credit card. You'll have to wait for verification after signing up, but it won't take weeks as it does with [Kraken]( I believe it's just a single verification step, not 3. Once that's done, you can use your credit card to buy Bitcoin in an instant, it's really fast.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a scary new thing for many people. Digital currency? That's probably magic or maybe it's exclusively for bad people or something.
As I take it, it shouldn't be used as an alternativ to fiat money anyway, i.e., people should not put their savings in a Bitcoin account. What it can be used for, however, is transferring money to friends and family, which means the sender turns fiat currency A (like USD) into Bitcoin and the recipient turns that Bitcoin into currency B (like EUR).
I've found a few Bitcoin exchange services that might be used to convert between Bitcoin and something else, but I'd like to know if that actually works.
For example, there are exchange services like "[Cryptex24]( or ["Blue.cash"]( Other services like "[Blockchain]( or "[Coinsbank]( look like they could be linked with a bank account to convert between fiat money on that account and Bitcoin.

That's right, even so-called fiat money is digital currency nowadays. I read about the gold standard just the other day and how paper money used to be more like a coupon for gold ("Will Pay to the Bearer on Demand", "redeemable in gold") a hundred years ago. But I digress.

I'm asking because I'd like to learn about the state of Bitcoin in 2017. I keep reading about it in the news, but I want to know if it's actually being used and if it can be seen as an alternative to Paypal.

That sounds like something where you meet up with random strangers in a dark alley to exchange money in person. Something that works online, like Paypal, would be better.
