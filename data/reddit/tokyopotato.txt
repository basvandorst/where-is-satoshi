SegWit will add a lot of flexibility to Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:30:41
Why do you need the confirmation so quick?  Are you sending to an exchange so you can trade for fiat currency or an altcoin?  The only time BTC transaction times are annoying is if I am trying to send to an exchange and want to use the BTC to trade quickly.  Otherwise, I don't mind waiting.  I am looking forward to Lightening wallets and payment channels for exchange arbitrage after SegWit is deployed

Because Time is Money.  And many people would prefer to pay a small amount of money in order to save time and not have to deal with shitty and fake torrent websites, and to have proper virus/malware file scans, and a good community.  We are talking about micropayments here, and I'm fairly certain "free" users will still have access and their balances can be funded by advertising splits to provide them with a small amount of funds.   It really is a revolutionary way to monetize content from every direction, which improves the user experience for all parties involved (end-users, content providers, advertisers, website admins, etc).  Another company doing something like this is Brave, and this is the direction that 21.co is pushing us as well.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:53:05
I think a lot of companies are getting into the micropayments train that can improve the user experience.  An example is the Brave web browser, the micropayment channels and hardware 21.co is working on, and KDC is now exploring the usage of micropayments for each download.  These micropayments will likely come from advertising, giving the user a better experience by monetizing the advertising in a more equitable way.  Premium users could subscribe and pay with Bitcoin as well, I'm sure.  These guys are re-thinking the monetization model
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:46:09
Every cup of coffee can still transact over the blockchain, just not via individual on-chain transactions. The solution is micropayment channels and they are coming soon to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-08-05 14:00:32
I think there will be tiered usage.  So, if you are a free user, you will get up to a certain amount of usage, and that usage can be funded through advertising splits.  Like what Brave is doing, it is a more equitable way to share the advertising revenues with users, which gives those users a small amount of funds to use.  The goal is to revolutionize the way content is monetized to provide a better user experience for everyone.

This is awesome.  I can't wait to use Lightning wallets.  Lightning will scale so well, especially for exchange traders.  It could help with securing exchange funds and also could give us a step forward in decentralized exchange protocol.  At the very least, it should great increase arbitrage capabilities and speeds.
Very curious to see all the the possibilities.  Thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:39:20
Exactly.  People need to zoom-out and stop thinking of bitcoin development as product oriented.  It's protocol oriented.  Development taking place behind the scenes and out front with 21.co is R&amp;D for new decentralized-distributed-internet-money-protocol based industries.  Blockstream is doing the same thing to develop the additional layers for bitcoin to allow society to really take advantage of decentralized tech.  It is thankless work
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:40:35
Micropayment channels solve all of the transaction throughput problems without the blockchain overhead. The updates coming down the pipeline over the next year will be extremely significant. Bitcoin is money, and for monetary purposes, since data is recorded in transactions, there's little reason to use anything else when the vast majority of development occurs on the Bitcoin network and it is the most secure network.

@_date: 2016-08-07 19:19:18
We have not even seen the implementation yet, so how can you throw the baby out with the bathwater after a preliminary announcement?
And what are you talking about side-channel? Do you have some specific information on how they will be doing this? 
Also, what do you mean piggyback on bitcoin's already established name and resources? Using the Bitcoin blockchain is not piggybacking, it is wise and adds value to the network.
There's really nothing that complicated in understanding that Bitcoin wallets 1-2 years from now will have Lightning or other payment channels to create exponentially larger amounts of micropayments and settle them regularly into the blockchain.  Micropayments have the ability to dramatically increase monetary utilization, or monetization, of microservices.  They are contracts, with a humanistic element ie: providing increased utility and service for humans
If the system is denominated in Bitcoin and settles in Bitcoin, I don't see the problem here.
Edit: Also thanks for the calm, adult conversation as well :)

Of course they are needed.  There are a lot more challenges than just scaling ahead. Security, privacy, fungibility, decentralization, and scaling, are all important.  Everything is coming together, you will see. A hard fork should be scheduled, but not immediately.

A Bitcoin hard-fork should only occur when there are no other options.  For now, we have plenty to build on once SegWit-enabled wallets and nodes abound: 
The truth is that SegWit adds a new dimension to Bitcoin due to the ability to create different types of transactions, and easily add support for more transaction versioning, support for Schnorr signatures, etc. All of this opens up sidechains eventually.
These types of changes add an order or two magnitude of additional possibilities with Bitcoin, and they should be prioritized above a blocksize hard fork.

More like a possible violation of the 5th amendment.  The government wants you or a company to provide a private key to incriminate yourself(s)? Fuck that: 
The Fifth Amendment protects criminal defendants from having to testify if they may incriminate themselves through the testimony. **A witness may "plead the Fifth" and not answer if the witness believes answering the question may be self-incriminatory.**
In the landmark Miranda v. Arizona ruling, the United States Supreme Court extended the Fifth Amendment protections to encompass any situation outside of the courtroom that involves the curtailment of personal freedom. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Therefore, any time that law enforcement takes a suspect into custody, law enforcement must make the suspect aware of all rights. Known as Miranda rights, **these rights include the right to remain silent**, the right to have an attorney present during questioning, and the right to have a government-appointed attorney if the suspect cannot afford one.

Actually, all it really comes down to is enough hashing power, wallets, and exchanges, running the hard-fork software and everyone else has no choice if they want to be on the consensus chain.  A hard fork is a hard fork.  You just deploy it, and if enough people run the software, it will hard fork.
That said, there is **always some risk** in a hard fork and so it should be done really only when totally necessary.  If SepSig can result in a 2-4 mb effective TPS throughput increase in 6 months, we are golden.
From there, community and devs can determine much more information and decide how to hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:54:55
That's why I don't want to hard fork right now, because I know that while it's relatively easy to hard fork there's no guarantee that the network won't encounter attacks during that fork that are unforeseen.
I would prefer we ("community") go with the Bitcoin Core route and close spam loopholes and build out network robustness, and improved network updating mechanisms.
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:16:45
That is very bullish statistics.
As far as price goes, the biggest unknown or potentially calamitous thing that could happen, is China shutting down miners and exchanges.  A massive sell-off China side would be about the only thing that could push the price down at this point in my opinion.  
If that happens, I think the price will rebound quickly as there's plenty of people that want to buy up more BTC.

The U.S. will not ban Bitcoin.
China has already banned Bitcoin for buying/selling goods and services, but speculation is fine according to them.  It would still be impossible for them to completely ban it, although they could shut down mining companies and exchanges.  However, Asia in general is moving towards Bitcoin.  If China decides to get belligerent, miners and exchanges will gladly go to India, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, and elsewhere. 
I don't really care if China bans Bitcoin exchanges and mining.  Any price collapse is an opportunity to buy more.  It's high time their people wise the fuck up and realize how fucked their government is.

@_date: 2015-12-18 18:19:25


No.  We do not need exponential/compounding increases in block size.  It's unnecessary and counterproductive.  There are other ways to increase TPS other than increasing blocksize.  We need to make sure we don't go parabolic:
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:17:07
What we really need is **dynamic fees** that can ratchet up when/if the network is DDOS'd
That combined with a **flex cap** on the blocksize is probably the best solution long-term. 
SepSig can/will be implemented very soon.

Well, there's been a few hardforks with various altcoins I've helped move along by renting hash power, but I actually helped with deploying a Cannacoin (CCN) hardfork.  With enough lead time and community consensus, they are totally safe IMO

Great point.  Educating an ignorant populace as to why money should not be controlled by a central bank is more than half the battle.  This is why Bitcoin is so critically important...

Lack of compromise can also result in a choice which is sub-optimal. In many ways, in order to gain more knowledge to discern the right way forward, we may need to try something like BIP202
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:18:36
I'm in agreement with you .  
BIP202 is a perfectly reasonable solution for the time being.  Clamping down on free transactions by removing the priority space is perfectly fine with me as well, I've always paid fees so my transactions go through.
I think people are scared that somehow banks will come up with an alternative that people will use (which will be centralized, bloated, and permissioned) and that's fine, because that will break-down barriers and allow Bitcoin to thrive even more.

@_date: 2015-12-27 22:04:24
SegWit is far more interesting than increasing max_block_size. It allows highly effective pruning, and better light nodes.  It increases TPS without bloating the blockchain and without causing all sorts of other effects that a block size increase would.It allows fraud proofs and other applications.  I am so tired of people pushing big blocks as the only solution to scaling Bitcoin.  Yes, we know increasing the block size will increase TPS. I don't give a shit about that.  I want Bitcoin to be decentralized and resistant to government/corporate attacks.  I would prefer we optimize Bitcoin Core before we increase block size.
That's my opinion.  I'm not interested in the FUD and whiners.  
I support Bitcoin Core.  I also support a small 2mb block size increase for testing purposes, but it's not the end of the world if this waits.
Especially since we removed priority space for no fee transactions, this will allow people who pay fees to have their transactions processed.
The whole point of fees is to prevent people from abusing the network with spam.
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:13:26
It's pretty well understood if XT becomes the longest chain and economic majority use it, then Core becomes the altcoin.

Because the Bitcoin Core developers have said they are not ready to do this right now.  That's why.  That's it, it's not happening in Core.  This was cleared up in the FAQ. 
Either people get over the block size increase and start helping others understand SegWit, or they continue creating FUD and coming up with "compromises" that are **simply not going to happen in Core**
While I support a 2mb increase in block size, **I am not going to continue pushing my opinion on developers that have made a decision**

Well, it does and it doesn't.  SW doesn't increase bandwidth throughput, but it does increase transaction throughput as a side effect.  However, the more interesting part of SW, is that it allows a new type of light node.
to paraphrase Andreas Antonopolous, "SW marks a turning point for Bitcoin"  
Why?  Because it adds a *new dimension* to bitcoin which can be utilized for not only scaling, but also for improved node decentralization and blockchain pruning, as well as fraud proofs.

Just curious, have you ever been involved in an altcoin hardfork?  Many of us here have deployed hardforks in altcoin networks, and with enough lead time they are totally safe and easy - as long as the majority miners are all on the same page.
However, as Bitcoin Core developers have noted, **hard forks reduce full node count** but they have a benefit of **pushing out-dated software off the network**
Anyways, it's time people stopped pushing the block size increase and start helping improve Bitcoin Core.
There are ways we can scale Bitcoin to 100+ TPS with 1mb blocks. We can have our cake and eat it too if people would just chill and help SegWit and other improvements that can reduce data bloat.

They can use mining pools to get shares, and get paid small amounts of BTC.  However, whether or not that is profitable depends on how much hashrate they have and how much their electricity costs.  Those with the cheapest electricity and best/most efficient ASIC chips make the most profit.

Yeah, absolutely.  I love Coinbase but really, there's no need for to deploy XT at this point.  
I for one feel that Mike Hearn cannot be trusted with Bitcoin.  Once his "benevolent dictator" coup didn't work, he just gave up and went right to work for R3 and develop bankchains.
That's not the kind of developer Bitcoin needs.  Bitcoin needs developers that understand the **real risks** to privacy and censorship that we face from governments and oligarch-controlled corporations.

    I don’t expect this post to help very much. The debate is already over, and everybody lost. We’re full tribalism* on this issue; anyone who pokes a curious head into the conversation is mind-killed immediately and with extreme prejudice.
    Nearly everyone is doing exactly those things which should be avoided (assuming bad faith, stonewalling, outright coercion/death-threats). Worst, those who were originally happy to not have an opinion, are now “selecting” an opinion, just to defend their friends and allies.
There's no more discussion about what is being implemented in Bitcoin Core for the time being, it's in a road map and an FAQ.  It's time to get to work.
If people want to run alternative implementations, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, they are welcome to do so.  However, Bitcoin Core is obviously working on their [roadmap]( and have already stated they are not going to increase the block size at this time in their implementation.
The way I see it, we now have a 3 party system, with Bitcoin Core, BitcoinXT, and Bitcoin Unlimited.  
I believe miners will go with Bitcoin Core for at least the next 6 months.
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:58:07
I agree, we need to figure out how to scale TPS.  But we need to do it in a way that does not cause blockchain bloat.  Blockchain bloat is the  problem that fiatcoin blockchains will run into because they are short-sighted.

Have a look at this too 
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:58:40


As explained in the previous article, Segregated Witnesses carry scriptSigs that unlock bitcoin. But they carry something else, too: version bytes. These version bytes preface scriptSigs in Segregated Witnesses, indicating what kind of scriptSig it is. If a node reading the version byte recognizes the type, it can tell what requirements must be met to unlock bitcoin in the scriptSig. If a node reading the version byte does not recognize the type, it interprets the scriptSig as an “Anyone can spend.”
This opens up all sorts of new ways to lock bitcoin up in transactions. In fact, it can be used to lock bitcoin up in any way developers come up with. As such, it's impossible to explain how this will be used in the future, since much of this still needs to be invented. But initial ideas include Schnorr signatures, which are much faster to verify than signatures currently in use, and more complicated types of multisig transactions; perhaps even Ethereum-like scripts.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:13:27
That's why Satoshi called the coinbase transaction a subsidy, it subsidizes the miners so they don't need to rely upon fees to get paid to secure the network.   We don't need a fee market right now because miners have subsidies.

I agree coinsprinkler.  The halving is partially priced in, and is probably what is driving the current bull market.  Nobody really knows what will happen as we get closer, but logic tells us that people will scramble for more bitcoins as the subsidy halving gets closer and closer.  The learning curve heavily favors those of us who have spent a few years in this space already.

@_date: 2015-12-28 22:05:18


I agree completely.
 &gt;The fact that some people, who freely admit that the blocksize is going to have to grow anyway (to support a larger number of users), but refuse to do it now (since they haven't achieved their desired goal of a heavily constrained fee market), is probably the bigger issue.
I agree with you, that is an issue.  
However, there are valid reasons why we should **wait** to implement a hard fork.  Hard forks are big opportunities to implement significant network changes.  Therefore, there might be **more**, or currently unknown, design parameters that the community will want to implement soon.  To do **two hard forks** back-to-back could be **even worse**.  
**Implement SepSig (SW)** as a soft fork now, optimize Bitcoin Core code, and then hard fork **after that** because there might be **more** changes the community will want to implement.
That seems to be what the Core devs are interested in doing, and I am fine with that.  The community needs to start thinking long-term when it comes to resilience against attack vectors (such as spam and bloat), and that's what I believe Adam Back and Core devs are thinking about. 
BIP101 is risky, we could completely hand Bitcoin control over to the banks if we do not adequately understand **centralization pressures**.
Nobody wants this to turn into another PayPal.

When interest rates are set by the marketplace, capitalism works.  Right now, we don't have capitalism.  We have monetarism. Capitalism is people saving money and lending it out, this is how banks originally made profit.
Now banks make their money by borrowing money from central banks at .25% interest and lending it out.  Central banks print the money then lend it to their friends for pennies on the dollar.  This is monetarism.  The average saver/consumer is screwed through the inflation that comes with this.
P2P lending with Bitcoin brings us back to the model of capitalism.  Capital is preserved and saved, and lent out to credit-worthy borrowers at a competitive market interest rate.

Thank you for attempting to explain in detail how it works.
I am aware of how complex the structure of a Bitcoin transaction is in that we are dealing with inputs and outputs, but I still don't know how RBF works in terms of allowing the same inputs to be re-spent to a different address(es).
I am just trying to understand this in a way that I can explain to others in even more layman terms than I need to understand myself.  I have studied Bitcoin protocol and been around since Feb 2013 yet I still cannot explain how it works in layman terms due to the complexity. 
Are you saying that the same inputs can be re-spent to a different output (different address) and thus a doublespend can be attempted to multiple outputs (addresses) as well as doublespending to the original output (address)?  
I realize this would be extremely difficult to achieve in practice but theoretically if this can be done, what would stop me from broadcasting hundreds of transactions from the same inputs to multiple outputs just to create spam and fill the mempool with RBF transactions?  Am I thinking about this all wrong?

Exponential data requirements and bandwidth requirements will also impose exponential cost increases on node operators that do not have access to exponential technological growth, ie: developing world. 
Keeping the blockchain as lean and efficient as possible is the best way to ensure a healthy decentralized network and global access for participants in developing countries.
There are ways to increase TPS without increasing blocksize.  Focusing on those mechanisms first is really important because they have exponential impacts on block-size.  
In other words, there are a lot more improvements to the protocol that can be made using new ideas such as SegWit and other proposals for improving TPS without increasing blocksize.
I am in support of a blocksize increase, but technological progress will also allow us to scale TPS without bloating the blockchain.

I'm not sure why the Core devs are so concerned about a hard fork.  They are perfectly safe with enough lead time for miners and users to upgrade software.  They also help to move the network forward by knocking outdated software off the network.  Yes, **hard forks WILL cause a decrease in full nodes** -- but this is going to happen sooner or later, and cannot be avoided.
My opinion: Let's hardfork all of this in with a 2mb blocksize increase.
Regardless, I support this roadmap, but I would prefer a hard-fork to implement SegWit!

I think what he's saying is that since so many coins are tied up or lost, the inflation rate is higher as a percentage.  So, if 15,000,000 BTC exist, but only 14,000,000 are actually accessible (not lost) to the market, the new coin supply as a percentage is higher.
However, it's pretty much speculation.
Inversely, if miners are choosing not to sell most of their new coins, they are not really adding them to the market.

Altcoins have a completely different genesis block and merkle root than a Bitcoin fork.  To call XT an "altcoin" is just not accurate, as it is bitcoin up until the block at which it forks, and at that point, it is a forked chain, the two chains will not exist simultaneously for long because exchanges, block explorer services, hardware/software wallets, miners, would pick the longest chain

We all know that you don't control your own keys with Coinbase -- unless you use their multi-sig vaults which offer additional safety in that your coins can't be spent by them.
For someone like me that lives as a nomad, paper wallets or hardware wallets are still potentially risky if I lose them or have them stolen.

I am confused.  Can RBF be used to re-spend (this is probably more proper than double spend) the SAME amount or a DIFFERENT amount? 
Can RBF be used to spend a DIFFERENT amount of BTC to a DIFFERENT address using the same inputs?  Because that would be a double spend.
If RBF is only able to be used to spend the same amount to the same address with a higher fee, then I wouldn't see the problem with this.

These are solutions in search of a problem, not the other way around.  This is why almost no consumer applications have been developed so far for alternate blockchains other than IOU exchanges such as NXT, Ripple, Bitshares, etc.  Novelty decentralized IOU exchange is just that, a novelty, it's not a breakthrough although it is valuable.

Ripple is a platform that enables secure, transparent, and fast trading of these types of financial instruments which doesn't rely upon the Bitcoin blockchain.  The Bitcoin blockchain being managed by anonymous miners is simply not a secure platform for mainstream financial industry.

It would make more sense for Bitcoin companies to work with Ripple Labs and solve the problems of cross-currency payments, contracts, IOUs and settlements together rather than continue down the road of fragmentation -- which is only going to get worse in the Bitcoin world as the more than 300+ altcoins continue to dilute the marketplace.
XRP does not have any competition.  They are well recognized for the technology they have created and continue to improve.  Bitcoin on the other hand, has loads of competition.
A Bitcoin-centric world is simply not in the cards.  The Bitcoin evangelists are more interested in disrupting the status quo than in building something useful for society.

That's why you don't understand Ripple.  You are still thinking that it is a competitor to Bitcoin, when it is not. 
The value is that it enables P2P distributed exchange that doesn't rely upon miners to secure the network.  It takes Bitcoin transactions off the blockchain, increasing the efficiency of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and FIAT currencies.

$5 fees are extremely far off and they would only happen *if* there are significant off-chain scalability solutions.  I am confident that there will be some good offchain scaling solutions 2 years from now.  Possibly via Factom and Lightning Network.  $5 fees would actually be fantastic for miners, but if we take into account that solutions like Factom would allow for hashing a record into the blockchain and maintaining the record data off chain, then one can fit significantly more financial and data transactions into a bitcoin tx.
Are $5 fees possibly eventually?  Perhaps, but probably not for a long long time.

Hey Luke,
Since you and the core team have direct contact with 90% of the hashing power, maybe you guys could just... talk to them? and encourage them to not shut their miners off for a couple days?  I mean, they are far more likely to destroy their long-term business model by allowing the network to suffer a brief heart attack, no?
I just don't see the economic incentive for them to not use their brains on this one.

Exactly.  Which begs the question, how will they exchange this cash for BTC and maintain compliance?  Someone has to convert this cash to BTC if they want to use Bitcoin as a store of value and for trustless banking. I don't see Bitcoin as a serious competitor to cash for face-to-face payments in retail shops.  So, this article isn't quite clear about whether they are just enabling BTC payments, or do they have a full-service Bitcoin solution that converts Bitcoin to dollars and puts it into a bank account.
It's a vague article that isn't clear what this actually does for businesses.

Why is it sad?  It's fantastic that Coinbase is responsive to its' customers whether through support channels or social media channels.

Remember these companies are dealing with a lot of inbound messages and there's no perfect way to help every situation.  I know this because I've dealt with customer support and there's a lot of spam and bad actors that take valuable time out of the day from helping legitimate concerns.

The problem is that using the term inflation or deflation is a relative term.  Inflation itself can be seen as decrease in value of currency, however, inflation of MONEY SUPPLY is a more correct way to use the term.  Deflation in money supply is just that, withdrawing money from the marketplace and thereby increasing the value of each currency unit.  Deflation therefore, can also be referred to increasing the value of currency.
It's just that... people are not being specific in their use of the word inflation or deflation. 
The more correct term for Bitcoin is that it is "disinflationary"

And that's a beautiful thing for cases where we are dealing with people we don't know across the world, which is in fact the original intention of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was created as trustless P2P decentralized cash for the INTERNET, not for in-person payments at a cash register at Starbucks where we are fairly certain that they are going to give us the god damn cup of coffee in exchange for the payment.  For those situations, we don't need to broadcast the transaction across the whole world that I got a cup of coffee and an english muffin for breakfast.  I can just pay someone through a channel.  Now we come full circle to what LN enables with Bitcoin through trusted payment channels.  Sidechains are another interesting use case entirely that really need exploring as well, that can also solve scaling issues in a different direction than LN, because we can for example have separate economies for Gift Cards and other tokens aka. liabilities which we can liquidate in a trustless manner.
Okay, we are still agreeing here just hashing this shit out in a long discussion.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:54:42
SegWit was not created to scale bitcoin in terms of "block size", it just so happens that it does give an effective increase in TPS which a block size increase of 2mb-4mb would also give us.
SegWit is technological innovation, whereas a max_block_size increase is merely increasing the size of the blockchain and the bandwidth requirements by increasing a cap.
And we know at this point, many miners will continue mining smaller blocks even if bigger blocks are introduced.  A couple of problems come with increasing max_block_size, which have been discussed over and over.  SegWit does not introduce these problems, and in fact it also solves a few other problems such as transaction malleability as well as allows script sig updates, and potentially signature compression as well.  With signature compression, it's possible to scale Bitcoin to much higher TPS without compromising miner centralization and creating additional attack vectors due to block propagation.

While Satoshi wanted one CPU, one vote, even this system is open to abuse.  Did you ever hear about the students that had administrator access to their computer labs so they mined Dogecoin on all the computers in their labs early on?  They did not do this because they wanted to support the network, but because they wanted to exploit free resources and mine as much currency as possible.  They "instamined" the network and didn't give a damn about the long-term stability or power of the network.  Even CPUs can be "spoofed".
There are some solutions to this problem in mining which is to reward **time** with representation, such as what is being developed in Nexus with regards to "node trust".  See 2.6 Node Trust  
We are also working on "miner trust keys" by rewarding trust keys to miners for devoting continuous hashing power.
Since time has value, time can also be seen as "investment" and rewarded with trust.  
These trust keys can then be used for voting.  It's a step towards participant representation and ensuring short-term actors cannot overtake a system through illegitimate representation.

We are talking about 0-conf transactions for trusted off-chain transactions using Bitcoin.  Like paying the god damn Starbucks for a cup of coffee.  It's not a big fucking deal to trust Starbucks, or your brother you are going to send money to, or your landlord you pay rent to.  Actually, you don't even have to trust them, it's just they that have to trust YOU in those cases.  But maybe you aren't totally paranoid all the time and you can once in a while trust someone for a short period of time (like maybe 10 minutes).
I mean for fucks sake, can you put something into context without other people having to explain it for you?  We are building applications to LEVERAGE the trustlessness of Bitcoin.

The point is that some people don't trust Bitcoin Core devs opinion on scaling, however they do trust the Bitcoin Core software that the majority of the network is running on.

Well, accepting Bitcoin for retail consumer payments is only logical, however... the real place for Bitcoin to shine in this industry is for B2B (business-to-business) payments between stores and their suppliers.
The question is since most people will use credit cards or cash the buy cannabis, who is going to convert this into Bitcoin?  At the end of the day, someone needs to exchange Bitcoin for cash, and vice versa, and whoever does this will need to use a large exchange such as Coinbase.  Will Coinbase and other large exchanges freeze their accounts?  Will banks freeze their accounts?
This article wasn't too clear how this will actually solve the banking problem, it's merely about one payment processor adding support for Bitcoin I guess?

doesn't affect you at all really, as long as you always have control of your private keys.  i don't recommend making transactions immediately prior to, during, and immediately after a hard-fork occurs.  just remember, your private keys are good to unlock Bitcoins on any fork of the chain.

Not all support employees handle every situation correctly, as they probably receive thousands of support requests (many of which are redundant or even just spam).

LN is not a sidechain.  Sidechains are other blockchains, with other characteristics that would be useful to organizations, and have built-in pegs to the main Bitcoin blockchain (private or public blockchain networks).  Sidechains piggyback on the network effect of Bitcoin and utilize its' proof-of-work for network security and consensus.  Factom is probably the closest thing currently operating that is similar to sidechain in functionality in that it does piggyback on the Bitcoin blockchains' PoW for security, but has its' own set of rules and systems for consensus.  The difference is that Factom doesn't peg directly into the Bitcoin blockchain (at least not yet).
LN is a layer2 scaling network that allows instant confirmations and virtually unlimited scaling through payment channels with trusted parties.

Right now, you can find trust and reputation with centralized marketplaces like Ebay or Etsy, but they charge large fees.
Other options include using something like Craigslist or social media, but these do not lend themselves to storefronts.
If I can host products/services on a P2P decentralized marketplace like OB and have built-in escrow, reputation/trust, and be able to use Bitcoin as the payment rail, it opens up a new dimension of global trade facilitation, as OB1 is borderless both in terms of a marketplace as well as the payment rail is also borderless.

Perhaps token pegging automatically solves the issue.  The point is that sidechains don't need to use Proof-of-work for consensus, they can use other mechanisms like Proof-of-stake or Federated servers, if people want or need tokens and those types of Intranet services.
Applications for this might be Gift Cards or Video Game Points

I used to believe that, but recently stopped recommending anyone buy Bitcoin at this point.  It's a highly volatile currency that is manipulated by whales in China and whose direction is now controlled by a handful of miners and mining pools in mostly authoritarian countries.
At any point in time, China could "ban" Bitcoin or crack-down on Bitcoin miners and send the price plummeting.  
The dollar or gold isn't much better, but at this time, it's pretty obvious Bitcoin is not a good store of value (for those who buy in at $400+)
A safer investment would probably be bullets.

You are 100% correct.  The killer app is decentralized money.  That's it. Every other use for the blockchain after that is a novelty. Semi-centralized token issuance using a "blockchain" is absolutely unnecessary for 99.999% of applications out there.  There is NO need for it.  Bitcoin, 21.co, SegWit, companies should already be building apps. The fact that they are not building apps is because they literally have nothing.  How can so much VC money pour into an industry with no revolutionary app developed after Bitcoin in the blockchain space?  They are solutions looking for a problem.  I support research and development but not the type of shenanegans going on these days in the name of blockchain.  That word is almost embarrasing now.

There are many options, and they all have side-effects or other ramifications.  The simpliest solution is bigger blocks, which will increase the size of blockchain significantly, the other is a solution to reduce the amount of data in each transaction and effectively fit more transactions in the same size (segregated witness or SegWit) which is currently a preferred solution by Bitcoin Core developers for many reasons.  A third solution which will become easier to implement once SegWit is merged, is off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network.
There are already off-chain scaling solutions using payment channels with 21.co software. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 00:15:50
The reason it becomes more useful when it becomes more valuable is because the larger the market capitalization becomes over a longer period of time, the more stable the price is and the more reliable it is as a long-term hedge against fiat currencies and manipulated markets.
Bitcoin does not become more difficult to obtain as it becomes more valuable, as the currency is divisible down to 8 decimals of resolution, and once off-chain transactions become commonplace - which is not far off at this point, then concerns about transaction times and fees will be a thing of the past.

At this point, bailing out the DAO through a hard fork will set a really terrible precedent.
Furthermore, there are a number of logistical uncertainties that could arise attempting such a hard-fork.  What if the attacker buys enough hashing power to fork to his own code? Or to simply maintain the current chain?
All of this just pushes towards more centralized control of the Ethereum blockchain.

This testnet example is only relevant because the cost is zero. On the mainnet, there would be a very high financial barrier to such abuse. SegWit makes UTXO spam more expensive, therefore it's an improvement.

There's multiple ways to increase the block size. Segwit does this by multiplying the effect of max_block_size into the variable block weight.
After segwit, any adjustment to max_block_size will cause a multiplied effect on the actual block size.
Segwit is a block size increase, ~ 2.1 mb immediate effective block size

I accidentally deleted my previous reply. ETC is the original ETH chain and is supported by those in ETH community whom value immutability. 
It was a good lesson for the BTC hardfork crowd to realize hardforks should ONLY be done as a last resort due to technical glitch not as a mechanism for economic bailout.  ETH did hardfork again after that, out of necessity and it worked, sort of, but they still didn't get it right. Each additional hardfork has made Ethereum value less and less, as it becomes more apparent the protocol simply will never be immutable

There are a number of ways to obfuscate transactions currently, and there will certainly be more in the future.  Segwit will help with that by incentivizing signature aggregation and coinjoin transactions.

I am with you.  Segwit soft-fork first, and maybe a hard-fork down the road if necessary.
@_date: 2016-11-07 03:26:18
I suppose it's possible. If you don't want to try a tumbling service, A few options are put the BTC on an address and send him the private keys , so he can import it and perform a transaction on his end. Other option is to use an exchange wallet to withdraw to his wallet, obfuscating you as the sender per se. Additional option is to convert to an altcoin , and send through Shapeshift who will send him the BTC.

Personally, I trust the judgement of Matt, Adam Back, Luke-jr, Peter Wiulle, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, etc. and favor a conservative approach.  I'm very happy with the 2.1mb increase in block sizes as a result of Segwit, and look forward to seeing the data to find out if a hard-fork is really necessary.

I am more interested in schnorr signatures and other tx version for anonymity.  
As for lightning networks, I think it's the perfect system for mixing trust and trustlessness.  Ultimately, all the world's value can be represented on the blockchain with this technology.  Especially, when you add private sidechains the mix gets even better :)  Yes, there will be some regulation, but there will also be hundreds or thousands of alternative methods of making payments and whatever you choose will be secured by the protocol's underlying parameters
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:57:32
Anyways. I don't really see the point of a private distributed ledger that is ultimately backed by Fiat. If anything, I would imagine it's quite a challenge bringing transparency and accountability to institutions that have routinely engaged in fraudulent activities from fake user accounts, falsified credit scores, guaranteed spreads via centrally planned interest rates, and papering over fractional reserves to make their balance sheets look good.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:23:04
This.  Not every node needs to carry the entire chain tx history, in fact, with pruning it would be completely optional.
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:48:53
I think the point is that value of ETH is highly speculative, and when something bad occurs, the loyalists get hurt while traders dump and then try to get others to dump it lower so they can accumulate again. It's a pretty negative cycle unfortunately. Many altcoins have become victims of an acceleration in lack of faith

Blockchain tokens like ETH create significant barriers to development in the long term as people become invested in different ideas of what the purpose is for these tokens.

Yes, I think P2P is more accurate.  The app might do the dispatching, but there are servers on the backend facilitating this and storing user data.
"1. Cell 411 does take some basic steps to maintain accountability on our network. Before offering rides to others, Cell 411 requires drivers to verify their phone number in order to create an audit trail for that user; we also require a profile picture and a vehicle picture. This gives us additional data points that will allow us to track down the user in question should any problems arise."

Probably because the type of constitutional republic in the US puts more power into the hands of the states, so the decentralization of power is at a different level.  A lot of other Western countries have more power at the federal level, and also have more decentralized power-sharing at the federal level, thus the "federal" or upper echelon discourse has more active players in these countries.  As for why, there's a lot of variables that go into that.  But it seems to be there is more release valve for populist pressures in some other democratic arrangements.
Iceland is small example, but shows us that democratic change can occur with third parties and as a result the people have more choice at the federal level.  It has a l ot to do with the form of government and size of the country I'm sure.  
*edit* Hell, look at China, they basically only have one party.  They are even MORE ripe for disruption. 
And this really is all about disruption.  technology is just disrupting the traditional way that propaganda and psychological warfare have traditionally controlled the discourse.  look at wikileaks, they are impaling the establishment with facts and the people know what's going on now.

You're missing the point and I think you don't really understand the technology of distributed systems enough to comprehend what I just told you.  The whitepaper outlined a VISION but did not forsee all of the challenges that would need to be overcome in order to provide the micropayments you and I both want.
We all want Bitcoin to fulfill the vision, but the ways to achieve that vision should not come at the cost of destroying the immutability of the system.
In those early days, hard forking was not an issue because Bitcoin was not in the sights of malicious governments and actors.  Today, Bitcoin is under tremendous attack worldwide, and in order to maintain the immutability of the chain, we should not simply hardfork to scale the system when it can be scaled in safer ways.

Segwit increases the blocksize by multiplying the effect of max_block_size into a variable known as blockweight. Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 enables ~3x as many options for scaling almost immediately (segwit, sidechains, lightning networks, schnorr signatures,etc). This is important because not caring how big the blockchain gets is one thing, but block propagation on the network is another thing, as well as database improvements to handle the increased amount of data by nodes. This requires a number of improvements such as better database structures, pruning and lightning networks to efficiently route payments.
Again, Segwit DOES increase the size of blocks just using a different variable now, blockweight, as the max_block_size variable is now multiplied by a factor of 1.7x-4x
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:41:08
Please stop posting about your premined altcoin here, it's disrespectful.  If I want to use a zerocoin protocol now, can use Z-Classic (non-premined fork of Zcash).

It means that, if someone makes a segwit transaction, there will be a lot less possibility of double-spend attacks, especially if they pay high-priority fees because the tx-id cannot be malleated. 
Tx malleation will still be possible by performing regular bitcoin transactions.  So, ultimately, we will need wallets that ensure we have the information to make good decisions

I'm hoping that as bitcoin mining hardware advancement slows and price come down, it will become more likely that water heaters, home heaters, pool heaters, etc, will start to be designed to utilize the heat produced by bitcoin mining hardware.  This would help offset heating costs for people and increase decentralization.
"It seems that significant hardware advances cause centralization because fewer people are able to get their hands on the new generation of hardware, but as the advances become less significant the network decentralizes again because mining becomes more competitive. "

Olivier's positions are clear.  He's very bitter towards Core, and frankly, it's annoying to listen to.  He and Roger Ver need to get over their incessant need to control the discourse, and start working with the community to find common ground.  Constantly fanning the flames with aggressive rhetoric certainly shows how passionate they are but perhaps a little misguided. There's exciting work happening with side chains &amp; smart contracts, and lightning protocols, and segwit provides some improvements we need - so really, he should be supporting segwit if he really cared about Bitcoin.  But, that's just my opinion.

“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” (Bitcoin whitepaper Pg. 1)
That’s exactly what we are trying to achieve here by scaling Bitcoin.
In reality, Bitcoin is a very limited electronics payment system because it is slow to confirm the payments and doesn’t support instant payments, is somewhat weak on privacy, and has serious scaling problems.  It is however, a remarkable anti-DDOS messaging system, an asset securitization system, and an asset transfer protocol with the characteristic of immutability.  As a result of this, we have a very highly coveted ledger with a scarce amount of assets.  This was the actual invention that occurred here.  It just so happens that it could be used as money transmitting system if we defined Bitcoin as money, which is what Satoshi did by calling it digital cash.  But just because you wish something to be a digital cash / money system, doesn’t make it so in software.  At scale, in order for it to work like digital cash where you can safely spend instant zero-conf transactions, you need something like the Lightning Network.  So, in many ways, the Lightning Network will actually fulfill Satoshi’s original intention of p2p cash per the whitepaper. 
I suggest you listen to Peter Todd discuss scaling:

Yes, but if you understand how difficulty retargeting works with Bitcoin, it takes 2016 blocks for difficulty to retarget.  The minority chain could be stuck with a very high difficulty and a fraction of the hash power for weeks.  This could cause block times to take hours and possibly longer before new blocks are created, causing the minority chain to get stuck and then fork again, and again.

It's not really like Uber or Lyft, but it is rideshare.  I say this because Uber and Lyft offer a product that is all inclusive and provides a user experience supported by thousands of employees.
This is not similar at all in the user experience, and it's not really decentralized. Cell411 still runs the services centrally from their servers but the app is peer-to-peer like other p2p apps.  Drivers set their own rates and there's no guarantees of insurance in case of an accident.

You basically have a p2p network that allows you to create trust lines between parties.  With those trust lines, you can then trade with them instantly.   In order to create trust lines though, both parties must put up collateral (bitcoins) by locking them into a channel.  That's not exactly how it works, but might help you understand the concept.

And this is why I favor the conservative approach taken by Core and why I feel it's important that everyone support Segwit.  
I believe everyone must put aside their differences and dogmas, and work together to face the challenges ahead for Bitcoin.  The greatest threat to Bitcoin that I see in the short-term is not scaling but is government regulation and attack.  Core 0.13.1 benefits and why we need them are not fully understood by many who are opposing it.  Long-term, Bitcoin will overcome these challenges regardless, but we must not lose sight of the challenges that we face.

I think so too. The extra space will give free reign to spam, and the blockchain will be bloated before we know it.  We cannot roll back that type of change.  SegWit and payment channels will fix this.  I think that's what the industry will move to.  People store their Bitcoin on centralized 3rd party exchanges so why would they not utilize a 3rd party service built on 21.co payment channels right now for wallet and payment processing. IE: breaking down paywalls
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:12:27
it wasn't fully understood in the early days how to scale the system and prevent attack vectors.  it is now known that increasing the blocksize  creates incrementally significant increases in attack vectors in the distributed nature of the system for a variety of reasons *edit* thus, it is best to mitigate as many attack vectors as possible before scaling the network.  0.13.1 does make some significant improvements for scaling and reducing some attack vectors
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:01:33
There are serious problems related to background checks, transportation laws, here. There will no doubt be stings by police and huge fines or arrests.
On the other side, the level of support required to ensure customers will get good service will simply not exist.
It would be much safer just to take a taxi than use a service like this for average folks.
I still think this will be interesting to watch and the decentralized economy has to start somewhere, so I'm excited to see people trying. Also, I think starting in an unregulated city would pose less challenges than starting in a city with pretty strict regulations around TNC services

Elements Alpha is open-source. Liquid is a federated sidechain with a 2 way peg. There is no need for it to be open source even if we wanted it to be, because the technology already is open source and the purpose is not a public ledger. These companies are literally doing exactly what a bunch of altcoins (Ripple, R3 chain, Ethereum, etc) have wanted to do but couldn't because there was not enough liquidity or security with their solutions. Zcash (of whom Roger Ver is an investor) is using a closed door trusted setup. Have some perspective what's going on here and stop your baseless trolling.

Greed is what makes the system work and is how the system works, whether we like it or not.
One thing we can always know for sure, is that people will always do what they are incentivized to do, whether we enable this incentive purposely or they look for the attack vector which allows them to profit.  This is actually a very healthy behavior for the ecosystem, because with this greed comes investment and security.  
I think you are underestimating the value of the fees in reducing attacks on the chain, and securing the ecosystem.
Think about this, you are basically paying very little money to have secure wealth and sovereignty.  With this comes responsibility and some cost.
Bitcoin is not ready for the mainstream.  If it is ever to be used by the mainstream, we need things like lightning networks and sidechains.
There's no need to include every transaction on the chain, as you are seeing.  We can still settle everything onto the Bitcoin blockchain and have the same level of security, but varying levels of trustlessness, depending on if you are doing business with an untrusted entity or a trusted entity.
You should remember that the core invention of Bitcoin is not really a financial system it is a transaction messaging system with sovereign assets designed to allow decentralized communications/transactions that could not be stopped by DDOS due to the Bitcoin token and Nakamoto consensus which is paramount to the decentralized nature of its’ design.  That is where Bitcoin originated from, and is why Satoshi (along with many others) built on what Adam Back proposed with HashCash and Proof-of-work.  The original intent of the Proof-of-Work invention was to create a network that could not be DDOS'd, and in order for this to be the case, there needed to be a cost for spam and there needed to be separation of the powers amongst users, nodes, and validators (miners).  With HashCash, this came in the form of Proof-of-Work where Adam required someone to perform work in order to send a message/transaction on a network.  That is why Proof-of-work exists.  It is a cost barrier to participation in a system. But Adam’s system required the tokens be issued from a central source, and this created an enormous attack vector that swept the idea under the rug until it could be determined how to decentralize it.  What Satoshi did, was add the dimension of peer-to-peer network and Nakamoto consensus. Thus Satoshi figured out how to add inflation control. The cost barrier was translated into fees of the scarce Bitcoin tokens.  It essentially, is commoditizing the proofs-of-work by making the tokens that represent the work scarce.
I suggest listen to Peter Todd discuss the real challenges:

@_date: 2016-11-28 16:20:31
One example I am thinking of, is an arrangement with your exchanges so that you can move money quickly on and off exchange.  Now imagine if two exchanges that have payment channels between themselves, and between you, and you can arbitrage quickly between exchanges and secure your funds more easily.  This adds a new dimension of liquidity to Bitcoin. Sidechains are already being done between exchanges now.
Peter Todd talked a little about this in his presentation at La Bitconf

I will probably support the 2mb  max_block_size but would like to see data on how the increase in block sizes due to segwit effects node distribution and miners first
@_date: 2016-11-29 01:47:26
Unfortunately for Ver, many can play at that game.  
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:12:12
I agree. I'm so glad that Segwit will double transaction capacity through bigger blocks and reduce fees immediately once activated.
Thank you for bringing attention to the need to upgrade to Core 0.13.1 and support segwit.
You are awesome!!

the soft fork at least gives the node operator plenty of time to allow for any bugs to be worked out of the new version. the hard fork immediately invalidates their node and forks them off

He's unable to articulate anything of significance. It's like he literally doesn't know what he's talking about.
@_date: 2016-11-26 02:35:34
Pretty much. Because LN, side chains, and schnorr signatures allow much greater scaling while still securing all funds on blockchain
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:26:17
Incredibly risky for both parties. Seems like localbitcoins would be a better solution for most people. Or at least a trusted escrow of some type.

Two things. Always backup wallet.dat files if you use a QT and also you probably just need to sync the chain. There's really no reason to use a full node client if you only use it once in a while as a wallet. I would recommend you get a KeepKey or Ledger wallet, and use Electrum or Mycelium on encrypted phone if you want some BTC on the go

I wholeheartedly agree.  They offer the best testing environment because they are live production networks with economic ecosystem (exchanges, wallets, services, etc)., but I don't believe they will replace Bitcoin, as Bitcoin is underlying protocol

Eh. IRS grasping at straws really. It will be very difficult for them to prove gains or losses, tax liabilities, etc, for most users. It's a waste of time and resources, let them spin their wheels. Mass gathering of data; assuming guilt and malintent, ie: guilty until proven innocent, is a constitutional issue. I suspect the State is very concerned about technology disrupting their monopoly on money, but this won't stop it. It will only push us towards more decentralized exchange solutions

@_date: 2016-11-26 13:42:28
OB1, Bitcoin tx, segwit tx, LN payments, sidechain settlement, Schnorr signatures, are all mutually inclusive.  
Bitcoin must scale and we also need better fungibility.  
We should all be on the same page here, and more concerned with the next steps that come after segwit activates.  At that point, one can either continue using the chain the same way or go in a plethora of directions to solve problems of privacy and fungibility, secure zeroconf instant TX, high volume payment channels for exchange arbitrage, etc.
I understand that everyone has their idea of the best way to do all of this, but nobody is at fault here.  Pragmatism is really necessary at this point imo.
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:16:04
Correct, this way you only need to trust Bitpay, and then you could easily make instant payments to vendors through the trusted channels they setup with merchants.  Similar to how people pay at VISA mastercard terminals made by NCR and Ingenio, in practice, but is decentralized (distributed) and *relatively* trustless.  You can settle the payments much quicker and you own the assets :)
Additionally, you can setup payment channels with exchanges and move coins on and off exchange much quicker, making trading safer, cheaper, and much faster.  This opens up a world of arbitrage opportunities. It's a payment network though that is open to anyone and all use cases really.
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:00:35
Hehe.  BUTC?  
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:33:34
I am most looking forward to zeroconf transactions.  I think this is one of the biggest problems with face-to-face transactions.
Right now, zeroconf transactions are not safe, due to transaction malleability, so being able to make SegWit transactions will decrease the risk.  Almost all transaction malleability issues will be able to be mitigated with Segwit transactions.
I'm also very happy about LN.  The biggest problem with Bitcoin exchanges is that people have to leave funds on the exchange.  With LN payment channels, it will be possible to open a trusted payment channel with an exchange and move funds on and off the exchange very quickly.  This also could dramatically speed up arbitrage capabilities.
@_date: 2016-11-01 00:41:59
I think ~9-12 months is reasonable expection for some major work to be done with new signatures and script versioning.  Schnorr signature support is already part of libsecp256k1, but there would need to be agreed standardization through a hardfork if/when to add it to the Bitcoin protocol itself.  This would likely also become a catalyst for blocksize update - although after segwit, hopefully we will be referring to this as blockweight as it will be a more accurate term.
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:08:38
It probably will eventually, a couple weeks ago we had some zero fee tx confirm

The current financial system is highly fraudulent, for many reasons. Distributed ledgers are not helpful for these types of companies because they clearly identify the fraud and disrupt the business model which is based on fictitious valuations for everything from credit scores, interest rates, Fiat currencies, market spreads, etc.
So far, the best use case for private ledgers are ones like Liquid that peg to Bitcoin for exchange liquidity
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:12:51
It does but at least old nodes can stay on while we move to larger blocks, and this allows some fixes that make LN and sidechains more secure, also Schnorr signatures and other tx versions can be tested. Tx malleability fix is also a big fix for zero conf tx
@_date: 2016-11-08 01:02:46
Any chance you will go to Austin and test it out?
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:05:48
Really? .
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:28:46
Segwit does increase fungibility, making zero-conf transactions secure by to fixing tx malleability.  It will also increase the adoption of side chains and the lightning network, two other ways to increase fungibility, not including schnorr signatures and signature aggregation that would encourage the use of coinjoin

@_date: 2016-11-06 16:10:32
It's not that people in r/bitcoin don't want bigger blocks.  Many have expressed interested in bigger blocks and extension blocks.  Segwit defacto increases the blocksize, and will result in "heavier" blocks rather than "bigger" blocks, now that blockweight would be a more accurate way to discuss blocks once segwit activates.

His comment literally doesn't mean anything, he's just pointing out something obvious that most of us already know, but instead makes this comment in a snarky way so as to draw a conclusion that he knows is not even true.... Thus... he admits this is a testnet TEST and does NOT simulate real-world.
I would explain to you why this is the case that it doesn't simulate the real-world, but I don't think you would be able to understand the complexities that make that the case.

Of course it's profitable since your main costs are "free", but you would produce a lot of heat and the miners are very loud.  It probably wouldn't make for great living conditions, but yes you could earn Bitcoin.  
You will need to determine your $/watt and as for hashing power, it depends on the crypocurrency you are mining, hardware, and mining software.
*edit* I think I did this right... with two S5 Antminers pointed at a pool, it will still take you ~200 days to ROI for the miners
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:48:11
Not really. Just proved developers that centrally control chain will fork when they want. That was obvious from the get go. Nothing wrong with that, it just makes the chain risky to use for financial or immutability uses, in which case, why have a chain at all and why launch any chain out of testnet for financial uses

Pretty much.  Not immediately, but it won't take long (my guess is ~7 days) for people to move their coins to SegWit addresses.
The more people that use SegWit transactions also means there will be more room for standard Bitcoin transactions, so there will be some immediate increase in transactions per block once it activates

If there is in fact a fork...
What is more likely to happen (based on my experience with altcoin forks) is that the old chain dies rather quickly because exchanges and wallets are updated.
Nobody wants to lose money by sending coins on the wrong chain whether they are individuals or large companies.
At a certain point, there would be little reason to support the old chain other than to be a "diehard"
I know you covered this in your blog post, but you over-analyzed the possibilities.  There is plenty of evidence from altcoin forks that tell us old chains don't last long if the majority update their software.
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:31:54
They can always choose new hashing algorithm and block size. The ticker could be something else. They just don't want to because nobody would use it.
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:20:50
Bringing up his concerns is not necessarily "throwing a fit" . He may or may not be wrong, but it's not a black or white conversation, and I imagine his interpretation and opinions will change as the industry becomes more cohesive. Rootstock is awesome, so is Blockstream's alpha elements, and other sidechain, drive chain, and smart contract projects. There's a lot of new innovation here everyday and it's a new frontier for everyone.
It's a strange world when we are simultaneously in competition and collaboration. I think Bitcoin embodies dynamic this more than anything else.
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:41:24
So basically, if the economic majority doesn't run the software they will reject the mined blocks/transactions from those miners and this can lead to the "old" chain still being the chain of consensus among exchanges, wallets, etc?

My understanding is that it combines the trustlessness of Bitcoin with the trust of two parties agreeing to open a channel for unlimited (or agreed upon limits). Thus, you could open a channel with two exchanges and quickly deposit, trade, and withdraw without needing to wait for confirmation because those two channels have already agreed to trust each other's zero conf payments
@_date: 2016-09-20 03:51:18
I care about being sovereign and want to setup payment channels with my favorite providers of goods and services so that I can pay them instantly with zero conf directly with no intermediary on the Bitcoin network.  It's just establishing trust with a third party.  That third party could be an exchange, or multiple exchanges, and I could for example then arbitrage the currency much faster, and be able to leave much less funds on exchange due to the ability to withdraw and deposit on a payment channel.  Thus, high volume artbitrage trading should be improved. Payment channels could solve the majority of blockchain bloat where onchain tx are not necessary or even desired.
@_date: 2016-09-19 14:46:32

Altcoins can serve to develop new technology or ideas, though 99% don't do this, doesn't mean that other 1% is shit. That said, I'm interested to see if Mass coloured Bitcoin token on Bitcoin blockchain using Colu will prove useful. It's the first colored coin concept I've seen that could be useful, but I remain pretty skeptical nonetheless. In altcoin space cryptonote was only innovation since Bitcoin really and like what  Nexus are doing to develop lower level database and multithreaded on chain scaling. Ethereum isn't interesting to me, because I think decentralized applications on a chain are pointless, and already shown to be a chain that has no integrity

@_date: 2016-10-26 13:31:06
Yeah, lots of FUD to try and keep the price down. Bunch of "concerned" people sold all their coins and are pissed because they want price to fall. People should know by now, stop using shitty wallets and stop using exchanges to store coins. The majority of stuck transactions are because people are trying to send from exchange to exchange, or are simply not using proper fees. Funny thing all these posts about stuck transactions seem to be missing tx IDs, and when they do, they all indicate the same thing -- people didn't pay high enough fees.  Scaling is a real problem, and Core 0.13.1 is almost out and will dramatically change the course in a hugely positive way. 75% reduction of fee prices is coming along with 75-300% increase in transactions per block without raising the block size.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:49:14
the problem is transactions per block, as well as transactions per mb. the two are not one and the same.  segwit will provide instant capacity increase and fix transaction malleability (enabling better zero conf transaction experience)

Precisely. that was Greg's point the other day, that just because people/pools are running a node as "bitcoin classic" or "bitcoin unlimited" doesn't mean miners are signaling BIP 109 or that they support larger blocks or a hard fork

No, they are fixing critical issues that need fixing before noobs can use Bitcoin the way they want. Zero conf instant transactions are what is needed and segwit and payment channels will get us there. So please just LEARN what is actually in development and stop repeating talking points

So you want higher fees and to make the network less efficient?
@_date: 2016-10-23 23:13:47
Proof of stake puts funds at stake, combines nodes and validators. There's no separation of the validator and thus without proper protocol to ensure nobody has large enough stake to double spend, it is unsafe. For example, with SolarCoin 99 billion coins held by devs means whoever gets those keys could double spend and also fork the chain because they will mint enough blocks in a row to do this attack

Blocks are not produced on a fixed schedule, miners do not know when a block will be found, so how would they anticipate when to turn on and off hardware. This would also cause difficulty fluctuation which would impact a number of things. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 01:18:54
Payment channels are the easy part. High speed transactions are another story. Combine those two, for high volume exchange purposes, and you need more complex smart contracts, and you have lightning. The result would be both more secure and instant financial transactions with a highly improved user experience -- all secured by the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:04:46
The goal is to fit more transactions in existing size blocks, not just increase the size of blocks, if we want to scale this correctly and maintain decentralization.  If the price of Bitcoin goes up and user base and amount of data transmitting across the network grows significantly, we want to maintain the ability of everyone to be able to run a node for decentralization needs.
The way it works is segwit transactions front load less data and therefore users will pay a smaller fee for segwit transactions.  The network will be incentivized to move into segwit transaction type because of the way they work to make transactions cheaper, which is fine because the ecosystem will also as a result move into transactions immune from transaction malleability.  
The price of fees is not static in the case of a blocksize increase either.  Therefore, if you increase supply of something dramatically (say instantaneously double or quadruple), the price for using data on the network will decrease or possibly crash until demand has met up with it, until blocks finally fill up again then we move into bigger blocks.  This whole thing is a risky proposition.
As a result of segwit, the network will take on more users, the price of Bitcoin will go up, and miners will make more money as a result of the continued decentralized growth of Bitcoin network.

Not necessarily. Core is focused on improving decentralized aspects of Bitcoin, and 0.13.1 will help us bring a new type of light client to the network 
@_date: 2016-10-28 06:09:52
Either way, "spam" or transactions as you might call them, shouldn't be free.  The cost is blockchain bloat.  This is a primary reason it's valid to limit the blocksize, because raising the price of data on the network reduces this attack vector.  By combining this with lightning payment channels, you can still secure your transactions in the blockchain but at a fraction of the cost.  The blockchain usage cases would then be scaled up as well.  The entire ecosystem would be much more stable.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:42:51
You would have to use a trusted third party escrow, like what bitify.com does
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:09:29
Yes.  They use Hierarchical Deterministic wallet.  Whenever you receive Bitcoin, you will be generated a new public and private key derived from your seed phrase.
This way you are never using the same public/private key twice, and this keeps your bitcoins more secure and also keeps your transactions more obfuscated because you are not re-using addresses.  This is the way Satoshi recommended using Bitcoin.

Correct.  It doesn't tell us what we already don't know, and can't predict the price of bitcoin and what will happen.
What is even crazier, is that segwit will lower the cost of transactions, and speed up confirmations, and miners will continue making substantial profits as the price of BTC rises as a result of this new increase in capacity in each block, and eventually, lightning network, payment channels, and smart contracts will make up a larger percentage of transactions vs. cups of coffee, and eventually, the price of Bitcoin will be $60,000.... maybe.

@_date: 2016-10-24 14:16:51
The blocksize outrage started because Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen were not successful at convincing people that bigger blocks via Bitcoin XT would not harm the network, and they decided to turn their failure to convince Bitcoin developers into a pitchfork mob.  It's quite obvious that bigger blocks (8mb+) will cause serious problems for the network due to bandwidth limitations and block propagation, which could centralize mining operations to one country, such as China, if they are propagating and validating blocks within their gatekeeped internet quicker than everyone else.
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:22:12
I only had one problem once with an unconfirmed tx, took like 3 hours.  The rest of mine have usually gotten into a block.  It's all about paying a few satoshis more than the recommended fee.  I've never found the fees to be prohibitive either, and besides the fees help give incentive to the system.
There's essentially two parallel and conflicting talking points coming from Core haters.
1) The fees are too high, we need bigger blocks
2) We need more fees to pay miners, we want bigger blocks
SegWit will help with both of those.  SegWit will reduce transaction fee price by 75% BUT will also increase transaction capacity by 75% to 300%  
It's a net win for everyone
@_date: 2016-10-25 05:45:44
Good thing Segwit wallets soon. 75% cheaper transactions and more transactions per block up to 300%, good for miners and good for everyone
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:33:01

You could start selling things on OpenBazaar such as arts and crafts, or goods.  You can also start purchasing goods there, or using a platform such as bitify.com for getting good deals as well.  ALWAYS use trusted escrow though.

Not true at all. This is Luke's opinion. And it's a completely valid opinion, so stop ridiculing people who know a lot more about p2p distributed protocol engineering than you. It's for this reason that Core is a great group of developers -- they all have very different opinions on a variety of development issues -- but still work together to get big projects done.

Roger Ver is neither an academic nor a developer. He is an investor. Greg is only pointing out that Roger is wrong in his criticisms of both Segwit and LN.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:01:59
Greg is correct here.  The outliers and edge cases get the most press, but they are actually far and few between, and usually involve a lot of inputs or factors of user error.  There's a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin works going on in the "blockchain" industry, and what the real challenges are at this point in time.  
The real challenges are making the Bitcoin protocol more **efficient** (more tx per kilobyte of data), **decentralized** (more nodes and lightweight blockchain, secure from attacks by govt or private organizations), **fungible** (payment channels, scriptsigs and fix for transaction malleability), and user friendly.

I discussed Bitcoin with family on Thanksgiving.  We were discussing UBER and it's influence in disrupting markets.  These days, all companies want to "UBERize" their industry and become the leader in disruption.
This is the perfect "in" to bring up Bitcoin.  The Banking industry is the most obvious legacy industry with little to no innovation...
I talked to them about steganography and network effects of Bitcoin, that basically Bitcoin will "UBERize" the banking industry, because you can now basically be unbanked utilizing a combination of hardware and software services. 
I am waiting to go entirely "unbanked" myself.  
It's pretty scary for many to think about trusting the Bitcoin protocol instead of their bank.

You are just exchanging one form of trust for another.  The Bitcoin protocol and blockchain is transparent.  A bank and it's ledger are private.  You are trusting that the bank is going to backup its' promises.

It could be automated on the exchange side to open a payment channel.  That's part of the beauty of it.  The technology could help to make decentralized exchange easier  to implement; channels that make exchange arbitrage much quicker since a person can do instant tx, they can keep much more coins off exchange - potential game changer in these way for security.
@_date: 2016-10-25 16:52:42

That is the choice of miners to mine blocks and include ultra-low fee tx...
You know, it was not long ago that some selfish miners were mining empty blocks because the subsidy was substantial enough and fees not high enough... there are reverse consequences 
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:11:47
Core is not focused on centralization of development, they are simply not focused on increasing the blocksize because there are much more interesting ways to increase capacity of the network AND increase potential for developers to create new types of transactions and consumer wallets that solve the fundamental problems of Bitcoin that currently cannot handle, the most important of which is **high volume - zero-confirmation instant transactions**
Lightning wallets will solve this - See Electrum Wallet announcement for example

It's actually not about holding 50% of the coins in circulation, it's about staking more than 50% of the coins on the network.  Not everyone is constantly staking, but if there is one person or a group of people who are able to stake the majority of coins they can fork the network and double-spend.  It doesn't really matter if a person holding 50%+ of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency decides never to perform an attack. The point is that when you have a handful of people or keys that control vast power in a network, those people/keys become targets for attackers and are the weak link.
Proof-of-stake flaws can be mitigated (see Nexus proof-of-stake using Trust Keys) but IMO I still believe separating the nodes from the validators to be wise.

The Wahhabi philosophy of Daesh, Al Qaeda, Al Nusra Front, and others comes from Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, actively support Salafi/Wahhabi terrorists in Syria and Iraq.  Just like the U.S. supported Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan that later became the Taliban, the U.S. has armed and supported a coalition of fundamentalist Salafi Sunni militias that are considered "moderates".  These "moderates" are funded to fight against Assad not against Daesh.  Daesh has now taken all their weapons and converted most of these moderate militias over to their cause.

Core is made up of individuals, it's not a united group that only thinks one way... they just happen to find a way to work together on what they do agree upon... because they believe in the greater vision
The Bitcoin subreddit moderators have been involved in the community for a long time (afaik), and perhaps a couple have contributed something on Github - even if just a comment.  
They are completely separate from Core developers.  Core developers don't owe an explanation to anyone in this subreddit, and many comment on twitter and on other mediums all day.  So maybe you should go find them and meet them, and talk to them cordially, and understand the vision that unites Bitcoin Core developers and cypherpunks

There's one thing we are certain of... coins are getting spread out over more and more hands.  Just like with exchanges, the more the liquidity is spread out, the less manipulated the price will be because fewer coins are in the hands of larger holders.  Sure, there will always be whales and hoarders, but the reality is the more people that invest in Bitcoin network the more likely that the market capitalization will stay stable and move upwards.

Correct, most opponents of Core don't realize that the core developers are in fact putting in place mechanisms to make the system more decentralized, and give people more freedom to choose new types of transactions (traditional tx, segwit tx, lightning payment channels) and different types of signatures (schnorr) all with the same consensus layer at the base

Why coin control?
The first version of coin control was called "Patching The Bitcoin Client To Make It More Anonymous". Sometimes when you receive bitcoins, the sender or even the public knows that it is you who owns the bitcoin address. Now if you later want to make a real anonymous payment, you shouldnt use those coins. Also you get full control over your unspent outputs and can do things like choosing which address actually owns the coins, clean them up or send all change back to the origin address etc. You can also prevent the bitcoin client from creating a change address by exactly sending the amount of selected unspent outputs minus the fee. Also you get a better impression of whats going on in your wallet and get a better understanding of the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:01:20
I believe the ATM (or BTM they have also been referred to) model might be outdated entirely as we move away from cash and paper.  The main problem with ATMs is that they are expensive to maintain and operate, have high fees, and are targets for theft.  There are a number of companies that are working on remittances such as Bitso in Mexico.
Probably the single best platform for facilitating remittances however is localbitcoins  
In fact, families can send Bitcoin from the U.S. for example to Venezuela and the person in Venezuela can become a highly reputable bitcoin seller and make money on the spread as well, providing not only financial assistance to the family but also a means to make money through arbitrage.
Also, as OpenBazaar gets more popular and the user interface becomes better, bitcoin could be used more and more by businesses and people who will store Bitcoins for savings rather than converting entirely to local currency

Increasing the blocksize does not necessarily increase the amount of fees.  It does dilute the fees and make fees cheaper for on-chain tx, at the cost of increasing bandwidth and data storage costs for nodes, and possibly leading to network centralization. There are a few different ways this is envisioned occurring over time until we get to the year 2140 when nSubsidy will essentially be 0. 
The Bitcoin blockchain is not only used for monetary transactions now, it is also used for historical truth and record keeping messages in transactions, such as Proof-of-Existence.  There are many companies and developers building proof-of-existence platforms that will anchor information into the blockchain with transactions.
On top of that, on-chain transactions are used for opening and closing payment channels.
Thus, Bitcoin will continue to be a *settlement network* as well as a *payment network* but as the usage of the chain grows exponentially through payment channels, it will move towards a settlement network and proof-of-existence network that secures the p2p financial network such as Lightning and provides basis for new governance systems, such as what Factom is working on, imo.

AFAIK, this is the first end-user product using tokens based on Colu colored coins on Bitcoin blockchain.  My understanding is that Masscoin support will be built into Mycelium wallet, and there will be browsers and browser extensions that utilize the tokens for payments.
It's like Brave browser but with tokens instead of straight BTC.  Don't know what advantages the Masscoins offer to developers, other than funding. 
It is good to see more companies jumping into adblockers that compensate content providers, and at least they are using colored coins instead of making an altcoin blockchain

private blockchains don't have miner costs but they do have administrative, legal, development, logistical costs.... Bitcoin will probably end up being cheaper to use due to it's market capitalization and no-risk nature.
if a company goes bankrupt what good is that private blockchain? or what if the company is wrong and the blockchain doesn't solve their accounting.
some businesses survive by NOT being accountable... private blockchains don't fix that

PoW is the key innovation because it separates the nodes from the validator - thus prevents concentrated wealth from abusing the chain. For example, SolarCoin developers can easily double spend if they want to because they have 99% of coins. If they staked them, they could easily mint 6+ blocks in a row. Proof of stake should be combined with Proof of Work, ideally with a trust key, which is what Nexus (NXS) is doing.  This prevents wealthy from gaining edge and gives those with time more ability to play.  Time is money, after all. Proof of stake works well unless someone is able to obtain a large enough stake to double spend, then the chain integrity is compromised. Proof of Work is the most important innovation that allows the P2P network to not be overtaken.  Proof of stake just needed some amending to increase node trust which is what Mr. Cantrell is working on.

Nation states are increasingly likely to collapse under their own weight (too many obligations, no ability to pay for them).
Bitcoin is a tool to protect individual sovereignty in this scenario, and it is this individual sovereignty which eliminates the ability of a government to manipulate civilians (or subjects) through theft of wealth whether directly or indirectly through inflation
We are just barely on the cusp of a revolution in commerce, see purse.io / openbazaar as an example of disruption

That explains why pure Proof-of-stake can't work.  Nor can nearly any non-mining distributed cryptocurrency.  One would have no idea who the other parties are that have a stake in that network.  The currency can be manipulated by pseudoanonymous people, there could be collusion, since they could control a large enough stake maybe not double-spend, but at the very least manipulate the currency.
Proof-of-work prevents anonymous actors from manipulating the currency through acquisition and collusion.
However, proof-of-stake type mechanisms can be used to reward full-nodes with the proper technology.

Sure it's reasonable, but it's also important to let people you know that Bitcoin and the Blockchain are at a very early stage of development and growth still.  The reality is that while many blockchains will exist, Bitcoin is likely to be the only one with enough widespread adoption to be used as a currency.  The more people invest in the network and the more developers that come onboard this one network, the more likely it is to succeed.
In other words, the upside potential to Bitcoin is much larger than the downside potential.  I'd rather lose $400 speculating than miss out on the opportunity to make $10,000 in gains.
Currently, the cost/risk reward is very low for Bitcoin.  With the halving coming up next year, the limitation in coins minted will dramatically scale back the number of coins available for investment on a daily basis.  
In other words, this (and potentially for the next 6 months) is pretty much the last chance to get onboard this train if and when it does take off.
If it doesn't take off, then it's highly likely you still haven't lost very much money.

The benefit of Bitcoin is that it is consensus that we all use simultaneously.  Much better to have one protocol that everyone uses than thousands of protocols that nobody uses.
Ripple has 3-5 second confirmations on it's network, and yet, it stands no chance to gain global use like Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-13 20:15:56
In short, Bitcoin is a tool that allows people to "opt-out" of the cycle of government oppression which occurs through taxation and violence.  It is not the complete solution, but it is the most powerful tool yet created for the empowerment of individual sovereignty. 
Most Americans have absolutely no idea (or even seem to care) what their government is doing with their tax dollars.  Those of us who do care and are somewhat informed can make a conscious decision to "opt-out" of this system if we choose.

Actually, I discussed this with some folks today.

@_date: 2015-02-17 06:09:10
Well the difference there with fiat is of course, the risk is "socialized" since the banks are insured and they just get insurance to make up for the losses.
Right now, there's no Bitcoin exchanges with insurance that I am aware of.  This is a major problem of course, and only one that will be solved by regulation.
The only way to negate the hackers and scammers is through insurance from what I can tell.  There has to be some way for consumers to know which exchanges are safe and which are not.
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:55:04
it's okay man, don't stress.  there is still time to implement these changes, the discourse has been pretty rough over the last few months, but the point of the Scaling Bitcoin conference is to come up with a BIP that can be agreed upon by Core devs.
@_date: 2015-02-17 06:02:42
Good point.  I mean Bitcoin works just fine the way it is and was intended.  I don't really care about exchanges, Bitcoin still works fine, but there is this trend towards Bitcoin community focusing on "consumer adoption" when maybe it's just a pipe-dream and Bitcoin is better of without the "consumer adoption" :/

Haha, I don't know if there will be a market for "numismatic bitcoins".

Purse.io can eliminate the fees and instead focus on building a user base for advertising, as well as offering optional consumer protections such as insured escrow 
Purse.io has the *potential* to disrupt this space in a very meaningful way
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:30:25
Perhaps an optional intermediary essentially offering third party insurance on the transaction for both parties? Doing business with someone that has an insurance policy from a reputable insurance company would be ideal for encouraging larger transactions. Perhaps one that awards a certificate if the business undergoes certain levels of transparency and third party oversight, might create a financial incentive to be honest.

If you are handing over the keys &amp; title to a house or car, you can rest safely knowing that you have the private keys to the BTC.  Liquidation is another story.  It sounds like the person was merely concerned with completing the payment transfer, not necessarily liquidating to a fiat currency of their choice

You could also play around with an altcoin QT client to get a grasp for how transactions and confirmations work.

Mine finally sent and broadcasted after ~2 hours as well.  Definitely poor connectivity of their wallet.

The lack of communication alone took them down a notch in my book.
