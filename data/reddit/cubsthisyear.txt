This is the worst advice possible.  If you think it’s going higher, hold/buy more.  If you think it’s going lower, sell.  If you don’t have an opinion either way then you probably had no business buying any in the first place, so you should sell.  Either way your decision should have nothing to do with the price you got in at.  That money is gone either way.

It sounds like you are arguing against the whole concept of capital gains tax.  I guess that’s a valid viewpoint to have, but it doesn’t really have anything to do with Bitcoin.  It doesn’t matter that you (or anyone) is calling Bitcoin a currency.  As far as the government is concerned it’s just a thing that you exchanged for another thing.  It makes accounting easier if we have some common unit to denominate the value of transactions, so for this purpose we use USD.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:06:22
If you buy something with USD and then sell it for more than your cost basis, then yes you have to pay cap gains.  If you are talking about unrealized gains, then AFAIK this works the same way for BTC.  If you own BTC and never exchange it for anything, you don’t have to pay any taxes on it.
Regarding your edit, I don’t understand how this is relevant.  Inflation is a thing.  Our tax code could account for this, but it doesn’t.  There are plenty of macroeconomic reasons why this is a good thing.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:21:25
But I don’t understand what the basis of that argument is.  If I asked to be paid in gold and price my goods in a fixed amount of gold, is that not a barter?  That’s almost literally the definition of barter.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:09:03
But this isn’t unique to BTC.  Essentially what you’re talking about is a barter transaction.  The IRS has always said that barter transactions are taxable, both as ordinary income and (if applicable) as capital gains.  I’m sorry if you don’t like paying taxes, but there’s nothing inherently unjust going on here.

It’s trivially easy to convert any major fiat into any other and can be done for a known cost.  I think there’s a fair point to be made about the morality of fiat, but that’s a fairly academic question.  My only point is that if you need to be sure you can procure food and shelter for yourself for the foreseeable future, fiat is the best way to do that.  All of the hyperbole about how fiat is “made up” just has no relevance.  It’s frustrating to see people making arguments that aren’t grounded in actual day-to-day reality.
I don’t think that volatility is unique to Bitcoin and I actually think Bitcoin is a great replacement for gold.  It’s when people start to argue that it magically solves macro-economic problems that I lose patience.  Ultimately any unit of exchange will always be at the mercy of the will of the community with which you wish to exchange.  No amount of crypto math or physical backing will ever change that.

This isn’t really true.  You always have the choice to home school your kids, you can send them to private schools and most school districts have “choice” programs that allow to choose which public school you go to (subject to availability).
The government obliges you to school your children in some way, but it’s fairly loosely specified.  In my mind this is no different than requiring that parents feed their children or provide them clothing.

The government doesn’t make anything?  What about education, healthcare, infrastructure, military defense, regulation and oversight?  You may not agree that services should be provided by the government, but I don’t think you can deny that they are.
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:04:36
There seems to be a lot of confusion in this sub between the way things *are* and the way certain people feel things should be.  It is an objective fact that most education in most Western countries is provided by governmental organizations.  Excluding the US, this is true of healthcare services.  Some infrastructure is built by government contractors, but a lot of it is built directly by governmental agencies.  Maybe you don’t want this to be the case, but it currently is.  This runs counter to the idea that government is simply unable to produce goods and services.
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:00:17
Right because the US and Zimbabwe are remotely comparable.  Yes, if your actual economy collapses, then your currency is going to be worthless because it no longer represents a claim on anything of real value.  That’s not at all the situation in the US.  Inflation is good for the economy because it incentivizes investment and mobilization of capital.  As long as it doesn’t happen too fast (which there are currently zero signs of), the dollars that have been devalued have long since been spent.
@_date: 2019-03-14 20:57:44
And fiat currency is simply a claim on all of those things.  It doesn’t even really need to be “created” at all.  The productive power that backs fiat exists regardless.  Currency is just a unit of measure and exchange.

Ask Japan how well encouraging savings is working out.  Saving is great idea for an individual and a terrible idea for the economy as whole.  Remember that saving doesn’t reduce the aggregate consumption, it just shifts it in time.  If it does reduce consumption permanently, then aggregate output has to be reduced as well.  Which, conveniently enough, brings us back to Japan...

Here’s a basic question for you:  let’s put together a basket of food that currently costs $100 USD.  If we fast forward 6 months, do you think it’s more likely that you will be able to purchase that same basket of food for $110 or less or it’s more likely that you’ll be able to purchase that basket of food for .029 BTC or less?   Let’s say we were betting your entire net worth and you had to choose one or the other.
There’s a difference between what *could* happen and what will *probably* happen.  Fiat has value because of the latter.

The ratio of median home price to median income has been between 2x and 4x for the past 70 years.  We are at the higher end of that range, but the current rate is lower than it was in 1960.
All of the problems you mentioned have much more to do with income and wealth distribution than with inflation.  In fact, inflation is the primary tool we have to keep wealth from concentrating too much.  A deflationary currency (i.e pre-Breton Woods USD) actually makes all of these problems worse by encouraging hoarding of currency.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:57:06
As this guy pointed out, inflation is actually helpful to poor people, who generally have a zero or negative net worth.  The only people who are really hurt by inflation are large holders of non-productive assets.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:02:01
It seems like you are working under the assumption that inflation only affects cash.  The other major thing it affects is debt, which is a big factor for large corporations and by extension their owners (i.e stock).  Many large pools of wealth responded to the financial crisis by lending the US government huge sums of money.  This money can effectively be reclaimed and redistributed through inflation and fiscal policy.
Also, I’m not sure what savings accounts you are referring to when it comes to the poor sector of the country.  40% of the US population has negative net worth.  For these people, inflation is actually quite helpful.
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:47:36
I’m not sure if it will rise or fall, but it’s definitely more likely to have it’s value fluctuate.  For all the talk of whether fiat or crypto or gold or whatever has “real” value people seem to forget that the value of money-like things is in their ability to be exchanged for goods and services.  To the the degree that a given unit of exchange has wild fluctuations in its exchange rate, it’s less suitable for that purpose.
There’s absolutely zero evidence that the relative value of USD is anything but rock stable.  While I agree this could theoretically change in the future at the moment this is exceedingly unlikely.

@_date: 2019-06-06 18:41:49
Are you even thinking before you respond?  Books are taxed based on their price.  So if a I exchange a book for money, the government taxes that transaction.  Similarly, if I exchange bitcoin (or a secret for that matter) for money or for goods or services that have value, the government taxes that transaction.  This is a basic part of our economy.

Come on - is it really useful to play semantic games like this?  No one is using Bitcoin to communicate.  It’s used for commerce, which has been taxed by the state for more than 2000 years.   And commerce has also been regulated by the state for nearly as long.
Blockchain is incredible technology, but all of the anarcho-capitalist bullshit that gets spewed around on forums like this just makes people look silly.

Do you have any concept of how much money $10T is?  You’re talking about a complete reorganization of the global economy.  
When you say that interest rates can not be lowered without substantial inflation, what do you say about 2008-2012?  We went from 5% to 0% and actually experienced negative inflation during some of that time.  Similarly we have been raising rates for the past two years and I haven’t heard about massive defaults.
@_date: 2019-02-23 03:16:48
It really can’t happen fast at all, not on the scale this article talks about.  The problem is debt.  There is $10T worth of outstanding debt that’s denominated in dollars.  Until this number starts to meaningfully move, we haven’t even *begun* the transition away from the dollar as the reserve currency.

Savings is a good idea for personal finances but actually pretty bad at a macroeconomic level.  Remember that savings is simply deferred consumption.  If the aggregate level of saving is higher than the aggregate demand for investment (which itself is a function of the aggregate demand for consumption) then that money just sits there doing nothing.  This is wasted capacity.  Do this long enough and you have Japan.  Obviously you don’t want to be Argentina either, but that’s more a function of outright theft and fraud than it is any particular monetary policy.
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:02:58
The part that’s left out of this equation is : to whom would that money be owed?  70% of government debt is owned by US citizens and corporations.  We’ve written IOUs to ourselves.  So this is really more of an accounting problem than an actual fiscal issue.  The US government cannot run out of US dollars.  It needs to be managed but it’s certainly not a crisis.

Savings does not automatically produce investment.  Firms are only incentivized to invest when there is enough unmet demand to make that investment profitable.  They might invest in technology to increase productivity, but if you keep the level of demand constant, this leads to less jobs, not more.  So while consumption isn’t everything, it absolutely is the prime driver of economic growth.

I suppose maybe for anyone hoarding dollars, but not for people who are earning and spending dollars on a daily basis.  Who cares if my dollar is worth less if I’m getting more of them?  Inflation is a feature, not a bug.  It keeps value (which is different than money) flowing through the economy.  If my currency is appreciating, what incentive do I have to do productive work to earn more?  If the time value of money is negative the whole economy shuts down in the long run because spending is disincentivized and spending is the only source of income.

It’s interesting to me that you seem to only be able to refute what I’m saying with ad hominem attacks, yet you claim a strong grasp on the material.  What specifically led you to the conclusion that Keynes analysis is faulty?  I’ve been studying Keynes and his detractors for 10 years and I’ve yet to find any good refutations of his models.  There are plenty of people who issue with his political conclusions (perhaps rightly so), but that doesn’t invalidate the model.

I was sloppy with my language and my research.  The chart I looked up only went back 12 years and I extrapolated from there.

How do you square this with DXY being near all-time highs?  I think many nations have talked about moving away from the dollar and then realized how difficult it is.  As long as the majority of long term debt is denominated in dollars, the USD will be the reserve currency.

But that’s the whole point of fiat, you’re not supposed to “hodl”.  You’re supposed to use your capital to do something with it, thus increasing aggregate productivity.  If productivity is increasing and you don’t see inflation, then labor is being devalued, which isn’t exactly better than devaluing currency.

This is nowhere close to true in a mathematical sense.  All of the actual research on DCA shows that the returns are on average less than lump sum.

You can’t just sprinkle statistical vocabulary around and suddenly have a point.  A lottery ticket is not necessarily a negative EV bet, though I grant you that it usually is.  More importantly you have absolutely no idea what the EV of betting on bitcoin is.  The best you could get away with is that bitcoin is not definitely negative EV.  If you believe in efficient market hypothesis, the long run EV of every financial instrument should converge to the risk free rate, which means it isn’t better to bet on bitcoin than it is to bet on anything else.  Clearly the bitcoin markets are a long way from efficient but there’s too sides to that coin - it basically just promises a lot of volatility along the way.

Except it’s not the rest of the world can just decide to use something else.  There is roughly $10T in outstanding long term (30+ years) debt that is denominated in USD.  This figure is increasing every year.   A shift certainly can happen but it will probably take 50-100 years.
Also remember that 70% of US debt is domestically held.  We’re borrowing from ourselves.  This debt is at ridiculously low interest rates because no matter how low we set the rates, the world still wanted to lend us money for the last 10 years.

If I can mine 1 BTC for $4500 that has to at least *somewhat* anchor the price.  Like maybe the price can be $6K or $7K but it probably can’t be $45K.  This is just basic efficient market hypothesis.
The reason that I mention inflows/outflows is exactly because of the mining rate.  At the current rate / price, BTC needs net inflows (I.e people converting gold/fiat to BTC) of $10M / day simply to sustain its current rate vs fiat.  If it’s going to run at a price higher than the mining cost it needs net inflows to significantly exceed that.  I honestly have no idea was that level is, but $300M / month is not a small amount.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:55:57
What makes you think the dynamics will work differently than physical gold?  It seems to me that there is a certain demand for non-productive stores of value (i.e gold).  A huge percentage of gold’s market cap is held by central banks so I can’t see most of that converting BTC.  So absent people converting gold into BTC I just can’t see any fundamental reason that this demand level will change when it has remained relatively stable for 70 years.
Also, at least in the short term, cost of mining definitely puts an anchor on the price.  Obviously if demand significantly changes then mining cost is less of a factor, but right now you can mine 1 BTC for about $4500 USD.  So inflows into BTC from fiat/gold have to significantly exceed outflows in order for the price to rise much above $4500.

@_date: 2019-05-06 22:12:54
But why would the price go to $6K or $7K unless there is excess demand over immediate mining capacity?  Like it might temporarily spike as it did last year but unless the demand is sustained the price will revert.  The main market makers in BTC (i.e DRW, Jump) are also mining so they should be setting their offers just slightly above their mining cost.
I guess what I’m saying is that just like any market, BTC is governed by supply and demand.  If the cost of supply stays constant (mining cost) then the only thing that will change the price is a change in demand.
