I think its fine but i dont see myself using it
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:21:33
I see your point but its not the same as having a pay with bitcoin button on the site
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:19:03
To tell you the truth my common sense says ebay should use bitcoin. ebay could still add the same fees to paying with bitcoin as paying with PayPal but it would be more profit for them since PayPal employees would not have to process  the payment. They could write a disclaimer saying no refunds if you pay with bitcoin and make it an option for the seller to add to the listing.

Are you living in the Philippines? Do you have a company here?
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:49:34
Im an American living in the Philippines and I have been loaning money on coconut farms in the villages. The payment for the loan is 100% of the coconut harvest till the loan is paid back. The ROI can get as high as 40%. There are tons of people looking for loans but I dont have the capital. If you are interested in expanding to your neighbor in the north let me know. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:50:13
I belive from a government perspective it is mandatory. But if your veiwing this as an everyday average joe you would rather it not be regulated. I personaly dont care as long as bitcoin becomes as global as it should be. I would love to be able to use bitcoin everyday for everything

But dont u think IT will happen at least once? Its impossible for use to have the same gmail address but not the same bitcoin address.  
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:26:35
Keep in mind i dont live near a big city so local bitcoin no chance. I buy my bitcoins on coinbase and then hold them on my trezor. When i want to cash out i send to coins.ph. I use coins.ph to load my cell phone and pay filipinos and move money to bank account in philippines.

I actually thought it was a good idea and that's why i clicked on the title. My point was the title is misleading. If you had been taking donations that continuously add up until reaching a million and then made one person a millionaire.

I dont know what this is can someone give me a simple answer.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:59:18
I get the gateway idea. I recently told a friend to check out a faucet were he can get fee micro bitcoins and now he is hooked on bitcoin. This my not be the killer app that brings the masses but it is another gateway that will bring some.

I agree and long run in the world of technology is like dog years  
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:46:34
Who cares about $50 in movement. The potential of bitcoin is so worth betting 10% of your net worth on. And i will add this point the chance of it going to zero at this point is not very good. It has current value even if it stayed at its current application level. Lets say that value is $50 to $100. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:36:47
when twitter first started most people thought it would never be big. Its because most people don't see beyond the basic application. With technology you have to dig deeper. IMO Twitter on the surface is kinda stupid but the organization of its hash tag system is what has taken it this far. Most people cant, wont and may never look under the hood of bitcoin just like twitter. And since at this current time it doesn't do anything to improve there quality of life its a fad.
