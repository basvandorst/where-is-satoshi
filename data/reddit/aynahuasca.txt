Yes by all means keep a public key handy so you don't have to plug it in to make deposits. Actually your Trezor will give you an unlimited number of public keys, so just save a bunch of them in a text file. It is best practice not to reuse public keys.

When a big order is sitting a modest distance from the current trading range, it can influence other traders' behavior.
The reason is that if someone urgently wants their trade to go through, they will place their bid/ask "downhill" from the wall. This in effect pushes some of the orders, and hence the price, away from the wall.
Presuming the person creating the wall doesn't actually want their order to complete at that price, but would rather continue manipulating the price, then they will move the wall around or cancel their order if the price approaches their wall.
The strategy works, until it doesn't. Eventually people catch on that the wall isn't "real", and they'll just place orders at whatever price they like, assuming the wall will move.
Also if someone wants to trade a large qty of BTC, they make accept the wall as an opportunity to do a large market trade without moving the price very far.  Now the wall guy has a problem because his liquidity has switched to the other currency - he has to trade back before he can put up another wall, and this would cost him money as the price has moved against him.
Now, you might also see a wall because someone just wants to do a big trade, isn't in a rush, can't be bothered to watch the live action, and is happy to just close their browser and let the trade execute maybe some time in the next couple days. This is actually a pretty good discipline even for the little guy. I've usually got a better price by being patient than by being worried that the price will move away.

That's fine as long as you remember the password. But you are opening yourself up to another vector of attack if the computer on which you encrypt the seed in compromised.
The beauty of hardware wallets is that your recovery seed never has to touch a computer, besides the wallet itself. You're actually largely defeating the hardware wallet by typing your seed into a computer.
I would suggest writing the seed in two parts and hiding each part separately. 
If you're storing a lot of BTC maybe get a backup Trezor and program it to the same seed. So you have two backup modes, in case you forget where the seed is or it is destroyed in a fire, etc. That is nearly the same thing as storing an "encrypted seed", but you're doing it securely.

No, you don't have to trust that it's uncompressed audio. It could contain instructions but if you play it you'll just hear static. Uncompressed audio is structureless per se - x86 instructions are actually a perfectly valid thing to listen to, as far as your speakers are concerned.
A buffer overflow exploit is not as simple as just putting some instructions in a data file - the program reading the file has to be vulnerable.
I would ask you to go back to the beginning of this thread and read the original comment I replied to with it's ridiculous all caps warning: "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ASSEMBLE AND EXECUTE".
This is not what happens when you play an audio file. 
Yes it's conceivable, it has even happened, that a very poorly written player could have a buffer overflow vulnerability. But that's no more likely than me rooting your machine through this reddit comment. The possibility does not warrant the sort of alarmism expressed by OP. Nobody browses the web like that.

Suppose A is sending lots of transactions to D. 
If I am node "B", do I have visibility of the fact that D is the endpoint for A's transactions?
Can I then make a decision to connect directly to D, in order to offer a more competitive route than via C? 
What would the process of negotiating that new channel with 'D' look like? What are the economic incentives for each of us to do this, or not?

I have some questions about all this.
With the internet we need routing because for one thing, there is a significant cost to physically connect a thing in one place to a thing in another place.
The lightning network isn't quite the same thing, because IP routing has taken care of the business of making everything reachable to everything else at negligible cost. And bandwidth/latency issues are de minimis for most applications - a payment completing in 10ms isn't much difference than 500ms, at least for any applications I can think of.
This is why we see the initial structure as just kind of everything connected to everything, right?
With lightning routing what is the thing we are optimizing when we choose a route? Lowest transaction fee, right? Or maybe we need to chose a different route with higher fee in order to clear a larger transaction?
I understand that (at least initially) every member of the lighting network will maintain a complete view of the network. What parameters about each node are known and relevant for the decision of which route to send a transaction out through?
If I want to run a lighting node, I am free to set any fee I want for the use of my capital to initially fund the channel, correct? But we would expect these fees to be very low because there is little barrier to competition.
Can I advertise different fees in each direction, so that for example if I want to keep my channel "balanced" I can encourage its use in one direction or the other?
I just want to understand better what are the motivations, costs, market pressures towards any particular topology or another. What does this look like in 5 years?
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:49:52
According to some CPAs. The IRS has not commented on this.

@_date: 2018-01-30 02:28:14
I understand that channels have a cost. And we might even suppose that the time-value of the committed BTC could be more of a factor to some participants, than the initial on-chain fee.
But I'm not on board with the analogy to network cables (or the "early internet" as suggested here). It's misleading to compare this to other routing protocols because we aren't dealing with anything like the costs or constraints of "meatspace" connectivity. 
I guess the cost of a channel is so low that none of this has to be all that well optimized for it to work very nicely. But there is an opportunity for whoever can move payments as cheaply as possible, so surely somebody will try to figure it out. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:40:40
Nobody can know how much of that is the amount transmitted vs the change.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:14:48
OK so there can be short ETFs too, if we want to talk about those. My point stands also generally: any derivative creates an arbitrage opportunity which ties demand to the underlying. Where long/short interest meets, it cancels out between these derivative instruments. The difference will be picked up by arbitrageurs trading real BTC, who are in effect, market markers. To the extent that net demand for ETFs is long, it means that much incremental physical demand compared to before there were ETFs.

Looks that way, yes. The Winklevoss "vault" isn't completely down and out yet though.


~~Since the ETF's are by definition 100% long, if they're~~ Supposing a long ETF backed by futures, someone has to take the short side of that trade. Those would be market makers, who would buy BTC on the open market and short the futures.
Net "physical" demand for BTC is the same in that case as a "vaulted" ETF. But the underlying mechanism is to offload that custodial aspect to the market makers.
That's assuming there's no fraud, i.e. bankers printing fiat with which to short it, thereby suppressing the price... and that's a big assumption... I don't have a position on that but I see it as a possibility and I wouldn't put it past them. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:05
It's not a "requirement", it's an economic incentive driven by the laws of nature. When market makers see a price premium, they will buy BTC and short the futures.

You make a solid point, except you neglected reversibility in the case of a mistake (vs fraud). With gold or paper it is harder to accidentally hand it to the wrong person.

Correct, Bitcoin can be used either as a commodity its own right, or as a token representing other value. In the latter case, we use very small amounts and we don't care about the "melt value" of the coin, just as we don't care about the value of the paper on which a stock certificate is printed.
But gold doesn't have this feature - you can't "tag" a gold molecule. This is a really interesting difference if you think about it.  If someone steals a necklace they can melt it into an ingot and it's totally untraceable. Some Nazi gold has surely been minted into American Eagles already. Gold is constantly being refined, re-cast, and re-stamped. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:47:23
Because gold is difficult to transport, people prefer to trade it using notes. And they trust the banks to keep track of the bars and to have enough to back the notes. This creates the risk of "rehypothecation", or fractional reserve. Banks can price gold any way they want as long as creditors aren't standing for delivery.
Unlike gold, bitcoin is convenient for modern transacting. It's more portable and relatively easy to secure. So people are less inclined to entrust it to counterparties. As long as people are hodling it and transacting directly in bitcoin, it can't be rehypothecated.

You don't know anything about heating. Please start here: 
I can't do exact calcs without lots of info on the ASICs but this is totally sensible and a good way to capture otherwise wasted heat. People use heat pumps to heat their homes and household water where the source temperature is in some cases not even warm, but below freezing, and usually using air which isn't nearly as good a source as a direct coupling to a hot chip. This is totally plausible, somebody just needs to put the pieces together.

Miners have to pay for capex and electricity. That is the cost of running the bitcoin network. Businesses generally use their revenue to pay their expenses, and we know that mining is a saturated market with low profit margins (evidenced by the plateau in hash rate since January).
Maybe some miners keep their BTC to some degree. But then they simply also count among "buyers" - it cost them fiat, paid via their mining costs, to acquire those BTC. There's still a known rate of inflation, and those new coins must be met by incoming fiat in order to sustain the price. 
We're characterizing aggregate cash flows here, not trying to nail down the precise the behavior of every individual.

As a transition measure they could accept cash and then trade it for bitcoin, then use bitcoin for savings and/or to pay some of their suppliers. As more of the industry starts to accept Bitcoin, and as customers start using it, gradually the friction goes away and there's no reason to use USD.

The fiat supply has no limit - it has been rising exponentially, doubling every decade or so.  Commodity money just does the accounting.
If you mean bitcoin vs real goods, yes there's a limit to that of course, which would be reached once it is widely circulating as currency. But until humans switch to measuring value in anything other than debt, we should all get used to seeing hockey sticks.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:52:29


Basically, but I'm not saying that Bitcoin MUST behave the same as gold. Only that it CAN go up in USD price exponentially for as long as they keep printing USD. Unbounded supply of USD means there is no bound on the prices of anything.


Gold doesn't *only* account for inflation. It also tends to increase in real purchasing power at times when physical metal is circulating as currency, and/or when income assets become especially unattractive.


That's true, but 10000%/yr is nothing when you just started from zero. We're still barely at 4x the value of a thermostat startup. Gold had a few millennia of a head start.

Currency has to go *somewhere*. Austrian theory predicts that this leads to a series of asset bubbles (real estate, stocks, derivatives) before ultimately people run to commodities - the "crack-up boom". Eventually we will suffer a currency failure and/or war. 


Who says they had to? In 2008, the market was trying to tell us that we were doing very stupid things like building SUVs, suburbs in the desert, art history majors, etc. We could have let those failed models fail, so that people with better ideas could acquire the assets through bankruptcy.
Instead, power stepped in and said we're going to print money to keep doing all this bullshit, because we're lining our pockets very nicely. 
Central planning can suppress market signals for a short while, but eventually we'll have to face the consequences. When planners allocate capital contrary to market demand, they are wasting resources to make stuff that nobody wants. Prices rise, unemployment skyrockets, and all the wealth goes to the planners.

Great post. In the 90s, if you made some money and drove a nice car, most people would look up to you and ask how you did it. These are different times - Marxism is thick in the air, and everyone will resent you. They might even kill you.
The trick for both personal satisfaction and social acceptance is to do something good for others *that is not a self-sacrifice*. So don't give away your money to the incompetent just because that's socially in vogue. Build something wonderful that makes the world a better place *in a way that you value*, even if your profit isn't in monetary returns.

BTC's utility as an everyday currency has no bearing on the ETF's function as a store of value. Even very high transaction fees wouldn't prevent the ETF from acquiring large tranches of BTC.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:49:48
As long as the currency continues to be regarded as a store of value by enough people, it doesn't crash and nobody trading it is *necessarily* losing money. Example:
Suppose "A" buys 2 bitcoins for $100 each, and these are the only 2 bitcoin which exist.
Then A sells 1 bitcoin for $150 to B.
The "market price" of bitcoin is now $150.
A holds 1 BTC, and B holds 1 BTC. They each have $150 worth of Bitcoin.
A's total net worth is now $300, because he has 1 BTC worth $150, plus the $150 in fiat he received from B. 
B's total net worth is $150 for the 1 BTC that he has.
That's $450 total net worth from $350 that went in. How is possible?
A "made money", but not at the expense of B. He made money because the commodity is now valued at a higher price. 
So who "lost money" in favor of A?  Obviously it's not the Bitcoin traders in this example. Actually, it's another party: the aggregate holders of USD, who didn't notice the tiny devaluation of their notes which occurred because somebody decided not to hold them, in favor of BTC.
**TLDR the losers are the ones holding USD.** That's what ultimately crashes if everyone were to switch to Bitcoin.

Shit worth of volume has been traded yet. Let's see if more people step up to sell at this generous premium. If any fraction of them use the proceeds to buy more bitcoin, then that generates demand for BTC whether they buy back in through the fund (triggering more shares) or not.

And they're rightly pissed, as it's being taken from them by force of law in the first place, but they refuse to see this. They just call for more rules, which is exactly what corporate lobbyists love to write. The outcome that they say they want (eliminating profits) is actually what only free market competition does.

Ya but you can't convert to *bitcoin*. Nobody can at this time, even the authorized participants. This is mentioned in the disclosures, and they're supposedly working on it but the SEC didn't allow it initially. 
So they may be buying the bitcoin to back the fund, but for all intents and purposes we can't say it's properly backed by bitcoin if there's no way to trade GBTC (or BIT) for bitcoin.
Astonishingly this means if the fund catches on it will accumulate BTC monotonically. That's good for all hodlers but if they don't resolve the problem eventually, the fund will lose credibility.
I guess they intend to fix this if/when they upgrade to a proper ETF.

I have argued for a long time that the market cap is a total red herring. People are used to thinking about the market cap of a stock, but Bitcoin is nothing like that. 
What's trading on the exchanges is a tiny percentage relative to millions of coin that could be in very strong hands. Some of them, perhaps even Satoshi, are dead. Unlike a stock, those coins can't be forcibly sold by a vote or acquired in a hostile takeover. Nobody should presume what those coins are worth to the individuals holding them.
I don't follow the short squeeze argument, I will study this more later. But I am glad people are looking at this from different perspectives because I think there is an illusion that Bitcoin is somehow "big" at X market cap, when in fact it is still very very small and we are seeing a fake low value ascribed to most of the coins that would only be sold at much higher levels, if ever.
I believe virtually everyone has underestimated how big an event this next halving could be, and we are set for a blowoff above $10K by the end of July. It would only take a few million USD per day of new demand chasing a small number of coins that people want to sell. It would not even take a billion in trades to get us to a trillion dollar "market cap".

This is true. I just checked their order book and it's still very thin. Last I heard their fees were high but they had come up with a new program to incentivize market markers. 
I always assumed they were more interested in the ETF than an exchange per se, but the exchange was somehow a prerequisite. Maybe they have their eye on launching a Canadian ETF some day?

I don't know. I think one of the Winky's hinted that this was the case. They haven't been forthcoming about the ETF process as they're restricted from certain kinds of public comment.  
I would think it makes the approval easier if there's a domestic partner from which they can acquire the underlying commodity.

I don't see how you can go from fiat back to gold standard. That's like reversing direction when you're in freefall. If people lose faith in the notes you can't just issue another note and pretend all is well.
We have to hit the ground first before we can climb back up: i.e. total failure of state-issued notes; back to commodity currency. That is: actual gold, or bitcoin - not "gold standard" which is as trust-based as fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:52:23
Miners accept whatever people offer, and they stay in business, or not, depending whether they can perform competitively at the prices offered. Mining effort increases when people are, in aggregate, happy to pay for it. 
Because block space (supply) is a scarce resource, the ones offering the highest fees (demand) are accepted first. It's just like an auction: the price is driven up by demand, and the trade occurs at a certain price when a voluntary agreement is reached.
If you want to accept 1 satoshi you can, but good luck staying in business when you have to pay for mining hardware and electricity like everyone else.

Crypto allows for competition among currencies to occur. This is a necessary prerequisite towards freeing one's self from central planning / globalism. Crypto is borderless, but it's the opposite of a "global" currency such as a dictator would love to issue. 
Do not presume Bitcoin will become or remain the dominant world currency. I think it's more likely we might have a handful of cryptos in competition, with precious metals also playing a role.
This is a wonderful thing for freedom, but do not confuse it with the political goal of a unified world regime. It's the opposite, it's decentralization. Should Bitcoin ever start to behave like a centralized currency (eg forking to manipulate the flow of funds), people will jump ship to another crypto.

Once again, the objection I'm raising is not to having courts at all, but to the idea that a court should nullify a contract on the whimsical criterion of "fairness". Especially under these circumstances where parties were dealing in a volatile, thinly traded commodity, where plaintiff was not unreasonable in expecting his order to fill at any price he cared to name, and where defendant made no effort to constrain the price at which he would accept an order.
You're introducing loosely defined terms here, and arguing a straw man as to what I suppose "free trade" is. Laissez faire capitalism (as I am advocating here, as opposed to the formal, planned economy), stipulates the enforcement of contracts on whatever terms people may voluntarily agree. Intelligent thinkers on this subject might have different ideas as to how that should be done, but I'm not proposing to do away with contract law.

Nobody is thinking about this. Just because we can measure something doesn't mean that  the figure has whatever implications we suppose.
People will be surprised when bitcoin hits $1MM per coin because they thought the market cap was "big" already.

No, that would be representative money, like back when dollars were ostensibly backed by gold.
Fiat is an aberration, an IOU redeemable only for another IOU of the same kind. The only scarce commodity it might be comprised of is paper, so its value is eventually recognized by the market in terms of the BTUs for which it can be burned.
We could compare Bitcoin in a wallet to gold in a vault I guess. But it only works for small amounts, you start talking about "all the Bitcoin" or "all the gold" and you no longer know how much there is that could be accessed, nor what the price would fall to if large amounts were sold.

This is top-shelf economic theory. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:12:48
Stocks and bonds are paper assets. So is a house for that matter. That is to say, you have a counterparty that guarantees your ownership of the asset, which is represented by an IOU, a statement from a brokerage or deed etc. Not only are those assets subject to deliberate, gross overvaluation by inflation, but there are also situations where your counterparty might fail to perform and you get nothing.
Bitcoin and physical commodities would be non-paper assets. At the end of the fiat life-cycle, value tends to exit debt and overvalued productive capital, and move into sound money (the "anti-bubble"). That's what a lot of Bitcoiners are counting on and it seems to be working so far.
I don't want to shatter your worldview here, but if you feel the desire to look into this, here is an account of the Weimar Republic's problems, which were caused by much the same policies that we've had in the US for the last century.  Similar thing has been happening in Venezuela right now. You can also look into Austrian Economics for the theory, or check out some of Mike Maloney's talks.
"At the end of the war the share price index had fallen in real terms to about one-third of its 1913
level. The year 1921 saw it at one-fifth. In October 1922 it dropped to three-hundredths, at which point it was a popular felicity that the Daimler Motor Company, factories, lands, reserves, capital
and organisation, could have been swapped for the price of 327 of its cars. "

I'm sorry but you have an incorrect understanding of commodity money to compare it to bank accounts in this manner. Bitcoin *is* wealth, not a vehicle for storing wealth of other forms. It is not a deposit account, so it is not meaningful to compare it to broad money.

There's a good chance that SSD is recoverable even if the PCB is burned. ICs can sustain pretty high temperatures and are not as flammable themselves as other components that might be on that PCB.
You would have to buy the exact same model SSD, and send the new one and the bad one to a specialist who does PCB rework. They could unsolder the chips from the cooked board and put them on the new board. This might cost you ~$1000 to do, but if there's a chance of recovery it may be worth it to you.

You are failing to use well defined terms here but you assert that crypto somehow "stores" the stuff (money) that "countries have" (which I'm calling, less ambiguously, "fiat").


Of course it is. But I didn't say it's not money. I said it's not a bank account.  It can be traded for fiat, but it does not store fiat. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin is money in a very different sense than USD/fiat. I don't even know where to begin if that argument is not familiar to you...

Banks rob savers by suppressing interest rates.
To suppress interest rates, they print fiat.
When they print fiat, value tries to escape elsewhere. Historically: gold.
So they use paper tricks to suppress the gold price.
People can only wait so long for the gold con to end, so...
The value goes elsewhere: crypto

You're right, the premium is highly variable (but has never been negative). I found a chart of the premium-to-NAV here:
Anyone can play this by trading Bitcoin back and forth to GBTC. This is probably a good time to sell GBTC in favor of Bitcoin, as +100% is way above the trendline which is pretty much horizontal around +30%.
Anyone know if it's possible to short GBTC? That's a pretty safe play if you own enough Bitcoin to hedge it.

People patent all kinds of shit, including stuff that's plainly already on the market. Are these patents defensible, probably not, but it doesn't stop the trolls from suing and they often collect settlements even when the defendant could have won, because it's cheaper to settle.
Furthermore lots of things can be build atop an open source concept and these improvements made proprietary ( Perhaps I should have spoken to IP more generally, as any implementation is also protected by copyright and/or trade secret unless released under OSS license. 
I'm not anti-business on principle, but there's a reality to how things work that people need to be aware of - the mainstream legal climate today is totally hostile towards innovation, which is why the "legal judo" of GPL/OSS has been so successful at bringing disruptive technology to market.
It is possible to have a business based on OSS, you can sell support services, bundles, or complimentary apps.

Your English is much better than I can speak any second language. However, terminology is really important when we start talking about this stuff. 
You can not store value "in" Bitcoin. In a wallet UI it looks like that's what is happening, but it's not how it really works. You can purchase Bitcoin, and it may be exchangeable for other things in the future. But there is no guarantee that it will be worth what you paid for it, nor any kind of storage taking place of the fiat that you paid to obtain it. It is simply paid out to the person who sold it to you.
As a thought experiment, consider the recent fork of BCH. In an instant, BCH went from not existing to having a "market cap" of $6B USD. Where did the $6B come from, and what is the meaning of this figure (if any)?

Just because you heard this stuff somewhere doesn't make it true. 
Companies often are organized for "any lawful purpose" - that is literally what they'll say in their charter. And there is nothing that says you have to incorporate as a 501c3 if you do not want the entity to turn a profit. That's a real pain in the butt to do by the way - mainly people do it so they can collect "charitable contributions" - a tax advantage for the person contributing the funds.
Startups routinely operate for years with the explicit understanding between CEO and investors that there is no intent to turn a profit this year, or sometimes *ever* - they'll run loss leaders to develop a brand, they develop intellectual property etc, with maybe the eventual goal of selling the entity, but not necessarily.
I don't even know that "Samourai wallet" is any sort of corporation with any sort of charter. It could well be someone's hobby. 
Lots of times people do stuff just for fun, and sometimes they organize their fun projects into a corporation so that they can get tax breaks and liability protection.

But I don't think that's what happened here. It doesn't seem that the funds were credited ex nihilo. Rather, plaintiff had an order filled at a price that the exchange didn't like, based on a whimsical notion of "fairness" that they are defining after accepting the order.

That works on gold (until it doesn't) because almost nobody takes possession - so the contracts can be leveraged into existence and settled by the printing press. This tactic could be less effective with Bitcoin since it's already circulating as currency and being hedl in wallets. 
Eventually it would fail in a positive feedback loop - if banks are naked shorting bitcoin into existence and printing fiat to settle the contracts, it means more circulating fiat that can leak out to real bitcoin.
I basically agree with what you said though... if bankers do manage to suppress bitcoin for any significant time, it will heat up the other cryptos. I'm coming to the view that the crypto space as a whole is "antifragile", although individual coins can be hurt in all sorts of ways.

No, this shit is complicated. Cap gains and ordinary income are counted separate. Additionally, short and long term gains are separate.
So for example if you had a 90K cap gain the following year, it is canceled out *entirely* by the carried-forward 90K cap loss (of the same kind, long/short).
The $3K limit is the amount of capital loss you can apply to offset *ordinary income*.

That's correct. If you own $5K of GBTC, you actually only have exposure to $3,520 of Bitcoin as of this moment. The other $1,480 is the premium and you get this back (+/-) when you sell.
This premium fluctuates and should be viewed as part of the investment, having its own risk/reward as it is priced by the market independently from the underlying price of Bitcoin. 
It's hard to say it's "overpriced" because there is no direct competitor to GBTC. The premium is just a component of its price, and it has always carried a premium.
The reason GBTC has this premium is very complicated to explain, basically it comes down a sort of defect in how the fund operates, due to some ill-conceived restrictions that have been imposed on them by the regulators. The fund administrators' hands are tied in their ability to "track" the price of the underlying bitcoin, so it doesn't track it very well. But this limitation creates an opportunity.
There are other instruments that have a significant premium to NAV, for other reasons. For example there is the PSLV fund which stores silver bars. But they do not add/remove silver bars from inventory every day, so from one instant to the next, depending how demand for the fund is fluctuating, the price might change relative to the value of what's in the vault. Kind of vaguely similar to the situation here.

I started on a simpler point but this has spilled out into a few topics.
I'm offering some distinctions between how the tax code has us calculate things versus what are useful concepts for any other situation in real life. 
I'm saying that if you want to have an intelligent view of your finances, you would consider your current positions as a profit/loss, not just taxable events. 
The original post at the very top of this thread said that Bitcoin appreciating against fiat isn't a "profit". If Bitcoin were gaining against fiat and nothing else, there would be some merit to this view - it would make more sense instead to say that fiat is losing value. But that is not the reality. Yes fiat is steadily losing value, as it does, but Bitcoin is appreciating against *everything*.
For someone to say they don't have a profit when their bitcoin is up a zillion percent, just because they haven't spent it yet on a boat or whatever, is asinine. 
Bitcoin is a liquid, fungible commodity - it's *money*. It is completely interchangeable with many other currencies at any instant, so what's the use of viewing one's own hodlings as having anything but current market value?

Alright let's walk through this. Suppose that two years ago, at the same moment, each of us had bought one bitcoin for $500.
And today, you sell your bitcoin for $7500 US dollars.
I hodl my bitcoin.
Today we are each wealthier in terms of US dollars by $7000, yes? But your assertion is that at this point, you have a profit, while I do not?
Next scenario, you decide you want back into bitcoin so you buy it back for $7500.
Now we each have one bitcoin again.
Did your profit go away?

"It's a beautiful thing, the Destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word, which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take ‘good,’ for instance. If you have a word like ‘good,’ what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? ‘Ungood’ will do just as well – better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of ‘good,’ what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all the rest of them? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning or ‘doubleplusgood’ if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words – in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston?"  - Orwell, 1984

If it worked right it would just have the annual fee, and the price would track BTC. The premium is weird, it's not like you're paying more because GBTC is so awesome, but rather because they're unable to resize the fund as needed to track the price. And you hodl the premium, it's not a fee.

I would highly recommend the whitepaper before you go too far down the path of imagining that blockchains are something that they aren't: 


You're alluding to a law of economics that has been expressed as early as Adam Smith: that if there is free competition and no barrier to entry, then competition will drive profit margins down. 
It doesn't mean people will mine for free, it means that to stay in business Bitcoin miners must have some advantage such as very cheap electricity, or proprietary IP (ASICboost). 
That's not to say a few people might not mine for amusement or to heat their basement, but these people will not be competitive with a big farm that is mining profitably. These hobbyists will not find any blocks, practically speaking, and will therefore have no role in defining what the blockchain *is*.

That word "intrinsic" is used many different ways and people get very confused. When referring to, say, gold coins we just mean the value that people care about is *in* the coin, as opposed to *extrinsic* where the value is a contract to be redeemed from a counterparty.  
It does NOT mean "gold has value whether you agree or not". Obviously anyone may choose to throw a gold coin in the trash, or not buy them, if they disagree.

Maybe, except it was also relatively low in mid-September, before that news.

Whether to buy or sell now depends if you want exposure to BTC anyway, and how comfortable you are having Silbert and the banking system as a counterparty to your money.
If you factor out the value of the underlying Bitcoin, then GBTC is historically cheap right now. If you're comfortable owning the instrument and you want exposure to Bitcoin by some means, then I would say it's a BUY.
I am surely going contrary to any "consensus" here, because most people do not understand what GBTC is, or why it sometimes trades at a very high premium.

I'm supposing that stocks and real estate will become unattractive and they'll want to hodl a portable store of value instead. Obviously trying to buy and sell a billion $ of bitcoin just to move funds would be stupid at this stage in the game. But give it time... there was a time when you'd take a huge loss doing that with just $10K, but not any more. 
Also I'm not necessarily talking about billionaires here but more like upper-middle-class Chinese... the type who buy Palo Alto homes for $2M cash. That's the sort of capital flight that China tries to contain.

If you say that bitcoin has value because of the work that went into it, you are arguing the labor theory of value - roughly akin to a Keynsian who says that digging holes is valuable just because work is being done.
Bitcoin is not *stored* computational labor because you can't redeem the electricity or capital that went in to make it. Those resources have been irreversibly spent. 
Bitcoin has value because it has good monetary properties which meets people's needs. It happens to roughly equal the cost of mining because we are still in the inflationary stage during which there is incentive to mine coins even at near-zero profit margin. If the value gets much ahead of the mining cost, mining effort will increase (but unlike gold, supply will stay the same) until it returns to equilibrium. Fucking brilliant!
The first chapter of The Wealth of Nations goes into a lot of detail as to how money evolved and what makes good money. If you can follow how we progressed from corn and sea shells to gold (periodically getting sidetracked into the disaster of fiat), then you can see how crypto is the perfect money.
Going off on a bit of a tangent here: Smith identified gold as excellent money, but recognized that it would be problematic for developing countries to bootstrap themselves using gold as currency, because they would first have to expend the resources to obtain gold before they could have good money to circulate. Especially true in the case of a nation with bad dirt - not much gold to be mined. Mining gold when you're starving is obviously wasteful and counterproductive, and in this case he cautiously conceded that notes would be a suitable compromise to get domestic trade going.
Bitcoin solves this problem because a new cryptocurrency "nation" can start with virtually zero expense and without having to issue debt - any new cryptocurrency can be launched with a few mouse clicks. It is only once it catches on that the miners need to be paid well. Bitcoin solved a known problem that Smith identified 250 years ago!

It's a bigger nut to crack than I want to get into right now... but a couple ideas you might consider, firstly that shamanism isn't per se an idea or belief system, as it is a methodology. The plants up our sense of intuition (feeling) by clearing out judgements and emotional triggers that keep us from seeing things as they are.
Intuition is just another form of percept, albeit an easily fallible one. Reason and intuition are not contradictory but just different tools that can be applied as the situation demands. People struggle in life because they can't make sense of which tools to apply where, or they are very weak in one realm or the other, or they lack the faculty of metacognition to consider what they're doing at all.
We would have to start at the beginning and take a great deal of time to make sense of any of this, but that's sort of the bird's eye view I'm at for now.

China has had capital controls for ages. Cash accumulates in the country because they manufacture and export so much, and the government tries to keep it in domestic assets. 
When Chinese people want to buy a house in the USA for example, they organize with family members to pool their wire transfer allowances on behalf of the person who wants to get cash out. 
Imagine if Bitcoin were to set free all that liquidity. The USA has been exporting its inflation to China for decades - they're swimming in fiat over there.

The market cap approach seriously understates the potential value. Some people think that market cap means the value of all USD that has "gone in" to the bitcoin economy. But this is not correct, market cap is actually just the last trade times the # of coins outstanding.
It is easy to see that market cap is not in any way connected to how many dollars worth are stored or circulating. For example:
A mines 1 bitcoin.
A sells 1 bitcoin to B for $1
One year later, B sells 0.1 bitcoin to C for $10
A has 0 BTC
B has 0.9 BTC ($90)
C has 0.1 BTC ($10)
The market cap is $100, but net dollars "in" to BTC was only $10-1=$9. 
So you can see that vastly higher prices would be needed to sustain the tiniest fraction of, say, the remittance market, because some people will hodl. This model incorrectly supposes that all the coin is available for sale, it doesn't account for strong hands who aren't offering to sell at the current market cap/price. 
Conversely, if everyone wanted to sell for whatever reason, existing hodlers would never get back the total amount of the market cap, because the price would fall as soon as a small fraction of the total were sold.
This is a huge difference from an equity, where market cap is meaningful because everyone knows that is what the shareholders would probably vote to accept (modulo a little premium) for a complete buyout.  Unlike a company, nobody can buy "all the bitcoin", so the market cap means jack.

Maybe. Fiat *is* specifically the problem, and dumbing it down for the benefit of the public doesn't always work. Just because people are more familiar with the word "government" doesn't illustrate the problem with their currency any better. 
Also, government issued currency isn't necessarily bad money... for example, at one time a US "dollar" was defined as a specific weight of silver minted by the government.

Assuming for a moment that the electricity could be transmitted to the buyer... and that a buyer would want to pay any premium for a fungible commodity....
If that one miner trades him the electricity instead of using it to mine, then the total mining effort goes down by a smidgeon. Now scale this up to many miners choosing to sell electricity instead of mining... as total hashing work decreases, profitability goes up for the remaining miners. Eventually the trade becomes unattractive and the miner goes back to mining. 
So one miner might take that deal. But in aggregate, the market applies pressure towards whatever hash rate / price point at which it makes sense to burn electricity to get BTC.

She most certainly did, not that it matters. 
"The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of accepting social security, unemployment insurance or other payments of that kind. It is obvious, in such cases, that a man receives his own money which was taken from him by force, directly and specifically, without his consent, against his own choice. Those who advocated such laws are morally guilty, since they assumed the “right” to force employers and unwilling co-workers. But the victims, who opposed such laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and they would not advance the cause of freedom if they left their money, unclaimed, for the benefit of the welfare-state administration."

Could we have a bitcoin transaction that specifies a continuous *rate* of payment?
The sending and receiving wallets would look at this transaction to see precisely how much has been paid since the "start" transaction was issued. Both balances would be updated in real time. 
At any time the receiving wallet is pre-authorized to issue a "draw down" of up to that amount, but this is transparent to the user and only occurs as needed when funds are spent.
The sender can terminate the flow at any time, at which point any balance due is disbursed to the receiver, and further flow stops. (i.e. anything paid between the start and stop transactions is irreversible).
The advantage to this is it wouldn't litter the blockchain compared to making frequent payments.
People who aren't good at handling money might find it helpful to have their rent, utilities, paycheck etc flowing continuously instead of in larger monthly sums.

It's not a matter of plain statistical odds as that the PRNG would have to be defective, in which case yes it could be giving out hackable or duplicate wallets. It's a hard problem in computer science to generate random numbers that are truly unpredictable.
One could conceive of a malicious wallet vendor who deliberately hobbles their PRNG in such a way that they secretly know which seeds it is likely to produce. Then they could watch the blockchain to see when those addresses come into use, and sweep them.
There is really no evidence here to say that a bad PRNG has generated the same seed for two people, but I just thought I'd put it on the table as a possibility.
A wallet could check to see if the addresses it is going to use have appeared on the blockchain before. However this does not guarantee that somebody else doesn't have the same wallet and they are only watching those addresses without using them.

Since its not fluctuating in correlation with the other shitcoins, it suggests to me that somebody(s) with a lot of money is supporting the price. They expect the market to eventually sustain it (so that they can sell much higher) but until then they are building perception of a floor around $600, while allowing for excursions higher. This person probably has a lot of BCH and therefore a lot of BTC, so perhaps they can afford to carry on with this for quite a while. Meanwhile somebody is running a pretty vile FUD campaign for BCH to take over BTC as the dominant crypto. If BCH fails to actually catch on then this play will turn out very badly for Mr Manipulator, because there's a lot of BCH still to be cashed in. I will not be surprised to see $1 BCH when people rush out.
Disclosure: I sold all my BCH for BTC and am 100% talking my book here.

Nope. From what I could gather just briefly, Argentina has a 0% capital gains tax rate so probably you owe nothing in taxes. 
Forget about looking through the blockchain to prove when you mined it - it's probably irrelevant.
I want to tell you - I don't know how things are in Argentina, how much official corruption there might be, but you want to be careful who you talk to about this. Because even though your profit is legal, you could become a target for theft/extortion etc by talking about it.
If I were you, I might just be satisfied to know that the tax rate is probably 0%, and therefore you might be OK to just spend your money and report nothing to the government. But keep records of how much you sold the bitcoin for, so that if they should ever ask questions you can show them how much profit you earned, and that it was through a non-taxable capital gain.
In the US things are different. Our government is very good at spying on us, our tax system is extremely complicated, and the rates are quite high. That is why everyone from the US is saying you have to talk to a tax accountant.
In your case I would suggest first spending some more time on google and whatever forums you can find, and when you ask this question you need to be very clear that you are asking about Argentina. If you do not tell people it's Argentina, they will assume USA and give you the wrong advice. When you ask this question the information people will need is:
1. You are a citizen and resident of Argentina.
2. You mined some bitcoin in the year 2011 when it was worth very little.
3. You held the asset and have a large capital gain.
4. You wish to sell some bitcoin and are unsure if you will have a tax liability.
That's the main information anyone should need to give you a general answer - they don't need to know how much you made. Only a tax accountant needs to ask that if he is going to calculate your tax obligation - but it looks like you are very fortunate that there might be none.

Once again, mining is revenue. You take the USD value of what you mined *at the time it was mined*, and subtract your costs to mine (electricity and capital) and that is your "self-employment earnings" as clarified in the statement you quoted.
However, if you do not immediately sell those bitcoins, but hold them, the appreciation of the asset is a capital gain that is realized at the time you sell.
In OP's case (if he were a US citizen, which he isn't) if he can not show the origin of the bitcoins then he can claim a $0 basis which is practically the same as $0.10 or whatever it might have actually been at the time. The IRS probably wouldn't hassle him about the mining income, they want their cut of the $300K windfall.
Nobody can advise him since he still hasn't said his country.

Free market people are NOT saying "you shouldn't change the money supply", it is much more basic than that. What they are saying is that when people are under coercion, you will have one socioeconomic crisis after another. That not only is it wrong to initiate violence against legally disarmed victims, but that these plans do not and can not ever work as promised. Fiat monetary systems are but one form of coercion in a planned economy. 
Let people freely decide what money is. Don't force them to recognize notes issued by any bank, state, or organized crime syndicate.
See how that's difference from an "ideology"? It's an objective recognition of individual rights. It's saying nobody should force anyone to do anything. It's an ideology in the way that *not* collecting stamps is a hobby.

More ELI5 explanation: 
Companies can be private or public. A private company sells shares by making agreements with people directly, accepting their money in exchange for a paper stock certificate which says they own so many out of so many shares of the corporation.
When a company "goes public", these shares which already exist and were already owned by certain investors, can be sold on one of the exchanges (NYSE,  NASDAQ, OTC).
GBTC used to be a private company. Now they have gone public, so those shares should be trading soon if people want to sell them. But there has been a delay in procedural stuff that needs to be done in order to get those shares moving. 
So right now you have people saying "I'll buy", but the people who have shares and might want to sell are not yet able to complete the trade.
There is ALSO a way for GBTC to issue more shares as time goes on, but that will presumably happen after it actually starts trading.

When the USD fails, bankers will attempt a "currency reset", meaning whoever credibly has the most gold will issue new notes backed by gold. That could be the US or it could be China, maybe Russia.
If it happens tomorrow, Bitcoin would be too small yet to be considered money by most people.

Ok so you have talked to a professional and this is why you are inspecting the blockchain? This is really important info for anyone who might try to answer your questions.
I suppose he would like you to be able to show that the bitcoins were mined by you, that you did not receive them as payment for something sold. This shows that your profit was a capital gain (no tax) as opposed to some kind of income (taxable).
This is one of those situations where you may be better asking forgiveness later should the issue arise. If you know in good faith that your profit is a non-taxable capital gain then just do your best to save some records and if the authorities ask, show them what you have. Save a copy your public keys, deposit confirmation to the exchange, and the trade confirmations when you sell. 
FYI I am not a tax professional nor knowledgeable of Argentine law. But I know a bit about Bitcoin and therefore what kind of evidence a tax audit might ask for. I am just telling you what I would do based on what you've said.
Just do your best to save whatever records you have and don't be afraid. For a young person to have some money, it's best to be quiet about it even if it's legal. Nasty women will take advantage of you, friends will mooch on you etc.

Adam Smith recognized that gold was pretty good money, but also pointed out that it has the disadvantage that it would be senseless to start a new nation based on gold, as you'd have to first expend the effort to acquire/mine gold (if there's even much in the ground) instead of putting your effort into productive capital. He cautiously admitted that notes were the only reasonable compromise to bootstrap a new economy.
But crypto solves this problem. Crypto is virtually free to mine initially, and only rises in mining cost as the value of the monetary bases rises to support it.
Satoshi solved a known problem in economics which had stood for 250 years. Bootstrapping an economy without banking.

Rand distinguishes acts of self-sacrifice from acts of voluntary giving. If you help someone because you *want* to, because you *value* them, then you aren't sacrificing yourself. You are gaining value in return - a friendship, a relationship, a family etc. The other person is pulling their weight by offering companionship or by satisfying your desire to see him succeed.
Rand opposed self-sacrifice, which is giving or being forced to "give" where nothing is gained in return. For example paying for government programs which don't benefit oneself, donating to people who will consume the funds offering nothing in return, allowing oneself to be enslaved etc.

You are correct that it's usually pointless to employ an FPGA just to implement a plain old CPU.
However, there is an advantage in that FPGA silicon would be incredibly hard to backdoor NSA-style. It's just an array of gates, so it's not like you can hide some crypto-weakening math routine in the ALU, because there isn't an ALU! It's all programmed on the fly. They could only target specific, known bitstreams. 
The compiled bitstream would have to be known to the NSA in advance. They'd then have to get Xilinx or whoever to put a routine in the hardware to detect this particular bitstream and substitute it with another bitstream on loading. And as soon as the next revision of the design were shipped, the NSA's patch would fail. Not to mention any such program-modifying hardware would be visible on the chip die as a bunch of extra ROM to contain the substitute bitstream. Multiply times a few dozen targets and it becomes an outrageous amount of ROM to have on the die just for loading backdoored CPUs.

You may find this interesting. The "shadow banking" system has a way of money creation by being able to lend against some of these instruments as cash-equivalents. 
"In addition to M1, the Federal Reserve also tracks a broader measure
of the money supply, called M2, which includes all of M1 plus time
deposits, savings accounts, retail money market funds and bank certificates
of deposits. Throughout the last half of the 20th century (until
2006), the Federal Reserve also tracked an even broader measure called
M3, which included all of M2, plus large time deposits, institutional
money market funds and repurchase agreements. M3 thus began to pick
up some of the money creating activity in the shadow-banking sector,
though not all of it. **We could easily imagine an even broader measure
that might include credit card accounts, lines of credit, or commercial
paper. What becomes clear as we think about these broader categories of
what is sometimes called “near money” is that various forms of credit
often serve as a substitute for money in the economy.**
The significance of this is that, while the Federal Reserve has significant
influence over the narrow measures of money in the economy,
such as M1, the private sector now has much more control over the creation
and use of near-money assets and other securities that act like money
in the economy. The Federal Reserve, which is the governmental body
that is supposed to control the flow of money and credit in the economy
in order to promote economic activity while keeping inflation under control,44
actually has much less influence over the supply of money and
credit than it has had historically, except through its influence on interest
rates. A substantial part of money creation is now in the hands of the private
sector. "

Maybe. The thing is, there are only a few designated parties who can get BTC in and out of the fund. So it's not a proper arb opportunity for just anyone, although maybe one could short or buy puts when the premium is high?
If you look at the PSLV fund you will see there have been times when it traded at a premium as high as +30%.  
At the time, I called a friend of mine who is a financial advisor, and asked him how I could arb (eg short the fund while buying bullion). He said he couldn't sell shorts on it, and I didn't look into it further.  
I don't know why PSLV went that high, and I'm not sure why the same thing couldn't happen with GBTC.

I assumed you had already heard of colored coins. 
It's doesn't have to be a new blockchain, so there's no premining involved and it enjoys the security of the existing network. 
It's just a matter of the issuer tagging a few particular satoshis so that they can attach other value to them by contract. Then whoever uses these coins has a special wallet which keeps the colored coins separate from regular BTC.

Yes, we've established that you recognize a particular group of people as "the state" and you recognize all of their laws, no matter how unconscionable, as being "the Law". You can thump on your dictionary or your law books and insist that it says so, but that is all a fiction you've allowed to be constructed in your head. You think it's true because they say so, and they say it over and over again, they issue stacks of paper saying you'll be forced to do this and that, and they wear suits and have guns and catchy slogans to make you think it's all the right thing to do. 
But sometimes people reject that programming. It's how things usually are, but it's not the only way that things have ever been. 
You keep bringing the US into this as if we should widen the discussion. What for? It works the same in any country. I'm actually not sure who "the state" is in the US any more, or what laws are being enforced any more. There seem to be quite a few secret factions competing for control of that region. And they have far too many laws for anyone to know what the law is.
This is a Bitcoin forum. A lot of people recognize that the US has been going the same way as Venezuela, Europe, North Korea etc for about 100 years. Many have already rejected the state, its centralized issuance of credit, its regulations, its welfare programs etc, and reclaiming what they can of their individual sovereignty. It doesn't mean they're free yet, but this way of doing things, I like the name "Système D" - it's how things start to go the other way. 
Bitcoin is an incredible defense against all these things which are being done, these things which Karl Marx proposed, these things which you do not call Socialism.

It's a corporation so there are directors, board meetings, yearly filings etc. But in this case we are talking about a corporation with one very specific purpose: to hold BTC and to issue shares. 


Oh yes, because they are publicly traded they must report certain things on a regular basis. GBTC is listed on the OTCBB exchange, which has less rigorous requirements than NASDAQ or NYSE. That's why they got to market before the COIN ETF - it's a much simpler regulatory process. See GBTC's filings here: 
In particular, have a look at "Interim financial report", releases 3/11.


The market buys/sells shares at whatever they want. However, the fund either issues or buys back shares from the market on a daily basis, in order to keep the ratio of shares outstanding in a targeted proportion to the amount of BTC in its vaults. This strongly encourages the market to trade the fund at close to NAV (net asset value).  
In other words, when people buy shares of the fund, the share price will go up. But then the fund will go buy BTC on the open market to bring it back into equilibrium. This is an arbitrage opportunity so the prices shouldn't get too far off from each other.


It's a public corporation with shares.


The fund charges shareholders 2% per annum on its holdings. Also, the "authorized participants" (designated parties who actually add/remove bitcoin from the fund) may earn an arbitrage premium.


Salaries for internal people - I'd guess at least a couple dozen. And then lawyers - lots of lawyers.


If more info were available it would be found under "shareholders of record" here: 
Officers are listed.


The fund is supposed to make a best effort to secure bitcoin on your behalf. However, as we know bitcoins sometimes get stolen anyway. You are outsourcing the task of holding bitcoins to someone else, but not necessarily the risk of doing so. If they get robbed, the value of the fund will fall accordingly and you will probably never see that value returned.
There is also the possibility of insider fraud - the fund could imaginably SAY that they're acquiring bitcoin to back their shares, but not actually do so. Some people suspect that this is what the GLD ETF has done. In such case, the fraud could proceed for quite some time, and the effect would be a suppression of the bitcoin price because they're not actually buying and vaulting the commodity. Hopefully they will do some proof-of-holdings, which is easy with bitcoin but hard with gold.
Personally I'd rather hold BTC myself. But I think these instruments will be very popular among people who want a little exposure to BTC, but don't have the time or technical acumen to figure out how to trade and hold it. Also people who want to hold some in a retirement account for prefential tax treatment. I don't have any reason to think these trusts are not legitimate, and I'd say it's a good vehicle if you don't want to deal with securing BTC yourself.

Be that as it may, what is the significance of Bitcoin's market cap? How does daily volume relate to market cap?
I think there is a presumption that market cap somehow reflects the amount of funds that have "flowed in". But this is not how it works, as can easily be shown in a simplified example. Bitcoin is not a bank account, it is a commodity. For every dollar that flows "in", one exact dollar flows "out".
So, we need better ways of looking at things. Market cap is very meaningful for a corporation - you can relate it to earnings, and it's a hint as to what the company could be acquired for. But neither of these apply to Bitcoin because bitcoin has no P/E nor can it be wholly acquired. So I think people are very misguided in talking about market cap as if it should be compared to Visa, gold, etc.

Is there a chart of GBTC holdings over time? Are they adding shares? I want to know if they are driving demand on the open market.
EDIT: to answer my own question their last report says:
"In the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an additional 31,400 Shares (314 Baskets), were created in
exchange for 2,939 bitcoins, 0 Shares (0 Baskets) were redeemed in exchange for 0 bitcoins, and
859 bitcoins were deducted from the Trust’s holdings and used by the Sponsor to settle expenses"
3K BTC is not a huge number for last quarter, but at least share creations are occurring, so some amount of the intended arbitrage is happening. If the premium stays high we might suppose that their "authorized participant" is acquiring a fuckton of BTC this quarter.

Of course it will be disastrous for the subjects of communofascism or whatever you want to call this plan, but those people are mostly the ones who sanctioned central planning in the first place. They're also the ones who failed to act as individuals to protect themselves from collapse by obeying their televisions instead of listening to the philosophers, historians, Austrian economists, and bitcoin advocates who tried to warn them.

There would have been plenty of ways for developers to get around it if they wanted, eg putting the core machinery into a separate app and then letting the wallet front end talk to it over a socket.
GPL was great for the linux kernel because they were competing against existing copyrighted Unices. it had the effect of encouraging hardware developers to release specs, and encouraged most outside improvements to be submitted to the project because those people would benefit from having their improvements incorporated in future releases. BSD on the other hand, fell to the wayside as a free project and became the MacOS kernel instead.
These days, public domainish licenses are regaining popularity because so many people want to commercialize their small apps, and they just don't want to hassle with GPL compliance. It seems to foster more innovation and sharing of technology in the present climate, and there seem to be plenty of open source contributors who are happy to see their stuff used in any project even if it's commercial - look at how well python is doing. It's better where you're trying to get totally new stuff out into the wild as opposed to fighting an existing IP cartel.
Since Bitcoin is MIT licensed, someone could fork it and make a GPL project if they wanted to. Probably few people would be interested in the GPL fork though, unless it added something really novel.
Bitcoin is fundamentally a protocol and not a particularly hard to replicate piece of software, so it's more likely to succeed by releasing the reference code with no restrictions than to encourage people to use a particular implementation.

You have to get your BTC into the fund first. Go back in time 12 months, call Barry, and ask to invest. Deposit your BTC and he will give you a stock certificate. Now wait 12 months. Deposit stock certificate with Fidelity, and then sell the shares.

It looks like the mechanics of getting bitcoin in/out of the fund is described on page 141 of "Interim financial report".
If I am understanding this correctly, it is not the fund itself that buys/sells BTC. One or more "Authorized participants" will be able to arbitrage any NAV premium +/- relative to the BTC price. They are thus incentivized to add or remove bitcoin to the fund, which will trigger the corresponding issuance of shares by the fund. The authorized participants earn the spread between NAV and the BTC market. 
So that should keep it pegged at 0.1 x BTC, at least in business-day increments of time. Right?

They are simply notes (colored coins) backed 1:1 by a counterparty who could charge a % or transactional fees for this service. You deposit $ in order to trade, they give you a note for your $. The notes can then be traded on the decentralized exchange. 
I'm not proposing anything novel here, this is just the idea of how a decentralized exchange would need to interface with legacy banking. Somewhere there's a counterparty, this is understood, but it *can* be decoupled from bitcoin trading to 1) create privacy and 2) eliminate half of the counterparty risk: the bitcoin side of the trade.

It's clumsy to make a statement about the *number* of bids when really what's changing is where the orders, whatever their quantity, are meeting on price.
We could disprove your statement generally with a contrived example:
Suppose the initial order book is:
    Bids: 
    
    Buy 1 BTC at 1000
    Buy 1 BTC at 1100
    Buy 1 BTC at 1200
    
    Ask:
    
    Sell 1 BTC at 1201
    Sell 1 BTC at 1202
    Sell 1 BTC at 1203
    
And suppose the last trade was at 1200.
And then, a series of new trades are entered as follows:
    Buy 1 BTC at market (executes at 1201, up $1)
    Buy 1 BTC at market (executes at 1202, up $1)
    Buy 1 BTC at market (executes at 1203, up $1)
    Sell 1 BTC at market (executes at 1200, down $3)
    Sell 1 BTC at market (executes at 1100, down $100 yikes!!)
In this case, the *number* of "going up" trades exceeds the number of "going down" trades, and the quantity of bitcoin traded in each transaction is the same. But the price has gone down a lot because the offered prices on the buy side were very low.
So it is not as simple as "more bids...".
It *seems* obvious that more people getting into the market and wanting to buy should make the price go up. It's probably the case, but it isn't necessarily true. I don't think you can make such a simple statement about it that would be always correct. When making a general statement like that, test it with reductio ad absurdum.

It hasn't always been the case. IIRC when bitfinex wasn't having problems but still had a premium, they would quote that. It's just that right now, Bitstamp might be the only functional exchange that they have a relationship with.
Also they are supposed to calculate for liquidity. So when you are checking out and a $ amount is given, they will calculate a market sell across the bids on multiple exchanges to tell you your exchange rate. This is why they claim the rate is better than you can get yourself by doing the sell on any one exchange, although I suppose this would only be true for a sufficiently large sell.
I think at some times in the last couple days, Kraken has been higher than bitstamp. Did you check the BBR at those times?

I never said anything about a *pegged currency*. That's what banks do where they manage the supply of one unbacked currency in order to match its value to another unbacked currency. Yes, that requires a printing press.
I'm talking about simply a private token. It's a promissory note issued by someone for one fiat unit, which they hold on deposit. It's adding one layer of indirection to the present exchange model so that instead of having $ on deposit, you receive colored coins which the counterparty promises to redeem when you want to withdraw $.
I can't be bothered to find references for this idea. Maybe I invented it, or its an obvious application of colored coins, but I feel like I read about it somewhere. Research it if you want.
I acknowledge it has limitations and doesn't create a fully decentralized exchange.
I acknowledge that issuing currency-like instruments that are privately backed by national currency is probably not legal everywhere. But we do have things like money market accounts which behave very much like private cash, so it might be possible even within the US regulatory framework if one were clever enough.
All I'm saying is it would make capital gains from trading crypto invisible because that trading could be done outside the regulated entity.

You've identified yet another point of semantic confusion that I didn't actually cover. I wasn't arguing against the concept of subjective value, and neither is Schiff.
What IS objective are statements such as follows:
A US $50 gold eagle contains 1 ounce of the element gold. 
A US $50 note contains a few grams of ink and paper. 
A US $5 silver certificate contains a few grams of ink and paper.
One bitcoin is comprised of... one bitcoin. A ledger entry controlled by a private key. 
Indeed saying "intrinsic properties" as opposed to "intrinsic value" might be less confusing. But as I pointed out, the term "intrinsic value" is already well defined as such in the context of gold coins. It means the market value of the stuff of which its comprised - what you can sell the coin for even if it's melted down and were stripped of its rarity and government backing. Schiff, as a gold dealer, should know better. 
In bitcoin we have intrinsic value/properties *and nothing else*, so it gets a little harder for people to grasp when they can't contrast that to legal face value or rarity premium as you have with traditional coins.

You need to survey *merchants*, as they're the ones exposed to fraud losses (in addition to the 2.5% processing fee).
The number is roughly 100%. It's just a cost of business if you take Visa/MC. How much you lose to fraud depends on how strictly you verify customer info, where you ship your products, their value, and how resalable they are. 
For example jewelry would be high because it's resalable, while specialty industrial controls lower. Shipping to western Europe would be lower, while shipping to Africa would be nearly 100% fraud, so they just don't get to buy from you.

Capitalism "gets corrupted" in the way that a turkey sandwich "gets corrupted" if you let someone fill it with rat poison. You're faulting the turkey sandwich, when you ought to blame the guys who pulled off a silent communofascist coup in 1913, the academics and politicians who continue to support them, etc.
It takes a vigilant, rational, informed populace to defend a free society. Whether people do that or not, there's a way that things go, and that is the way that Smith, Rand, Mises, Rothbard, Hayek et al predicted.
Bitcoin is succeeding because capitalism is correct economic theory.

I know someone in Brazil who has expressed concerns that she's not sure how to get her savings out if she had to. I think she is invested mostly in real estate. I told her to look into Bitcoin but I'm not sure if it's really the best answer with their BRL/BTC exchange rate being so high due to the capital controls. 
Having a good exchange in the country should help... if the exchange itself can't leak the fiat to buy more BTC abroad, maybe there will be enough arbitrageurs finding a way that they will drive down the premium.

Read the "interim financial report", it explains the mechanics.
I think it will take a few days for the fund to "bootstrap". I'm guessing they will give existing shareholders a little while to liquidate, then see if the premium-to-NAV remains high before issuing more shares. But yes that's the right idea, the administrators of the fund (or rather, the "authorized participants") will make money on the arbitrage, so they're incentivized to push the value towards 0.1x BTC.

I have used reductio ad absurdum to prove that the general case (Market cap is like a sum of deposits) is false.
I've shown two examples that a given incremental demand for BTC would cause an amplified change in total market cap.

No mainstream school of economics explains crypto, but the Austrians came close while the Keynsians are simply wrong. However even a lot of well read Austrian advocates such as Peter Schiff surprisingly failed to understand Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is like gold. It was deliberately modeled to have similar properties, and this is why it behaves similarly. It isn't backed by anything, and it doesn't need to be, because it's a scarce commodity *per se*. When we trade bitcoin we are trading just bitcoin the commodity, not an IOU.
Be careful as you encounter this term "intrinsic value", it is used in different ways by different people and this can get very confusing. Bitcoin has intrinsic value of the kind we talk about in numismatics, which is to say the value that a currency has by virtue of its composition, as opposed to a legal fiat value, "face value", or guarantee of redeemability which is imprinted upon it. 
A certain number of bitcoin is like a certain weight of gold in physical form. It has no legal fiat value, nor collector (numismatic) value. It is just a measure of quantity, having only intrinsic value as defined above.
The other sense of intrinsic value that people talk about is that some forms of money can also be used for such exciting purposes as tooth fillings.  If you think those sort of properties are important for money to have, you will have a hard time accepting why crypto works as well as it does. (I would argue that Mises' regression theorem is simply wrong, or at least clumsy to apply to Bitcoin).
One difference between bitcoin and gold is that while there are only 4 natural element with good monetary properties, there can be any number of cryptocurrencies. These currencies all compete in the marketplace. I could imagine Bitcoin collapsing at some time in the future, but only in favor of another cryptocurrency which has better monetary properties. Crypto is too useful to cease having value altogether, but one currency could win while others fail.
There are many properties which make Bitcoin superior to gold, as well as fiat, in terms of its usability as currency and as a store of value. I will leave that topic for you to explore - it is not hard to find that information. The best way to understand that aspect of it is to get a wallet and give it a try.

In order to have an IPO you need to have shareholders and a certain amount of assets to begin with. That is why the trust privately got investors to buy in before the IPO. It is these pre-IPO shareholders who had to be in for 12 months before their shares could be sold to the public. They become liquid in the IPO (although there might be some additional delay post-IPO, not sure on that). 
Additional shares will be offered onto the market if and as the fund acquires more bitcoin. These are new, public shares not subject to the 12-month thing.

That's not at all what I'm talking about. Liberty Reserve was minting private silver coins - commodity money.

Again, these colored coins would not be a competing or free-floating currency, it's simply a note for USD. Like a money market account, which exists.

While you sort-of recognize that socialism has failed you, your language is still dripping with the sort of judgements and slogans that stick in people's subconscious and cause them to mindlessly support this ideology.
For example:
"possible legitimate uses for Bitcoin are far greater than the black market can ever be." - Here you imply that the black market is something opposed to "legitimate".
"can afford to help feed their community" - Feel-good slogan, claiming a moral high-ground for committing self sacrifice.
"corrupt and incompetent governments" - blaming the actors as opposed to the ideology.
"the black market is it is a capitalists dream" - No, you are enduring the economic reality that is predicted by their theory. Capitalists dream of a government that protects individual freedoms and *does nothing else*.

Haven't heard that phrase before but I think it's getting at the concept of money being *stored labor*. 
i.e. having money *memorializes* the work that you've done. It is an implicit recognition by society that you have done work in the past to obtain said money. 
Of course, all this is true only of sound, scarce, voluntary monetary. Once "money" becomes more easily obtained not by produce, but by graft, it no longer has this effect of memory. Indeed those issuing such "money" would prefer we forget altogether who they are and what they've done to obtain it.

I don't really have a better idea. It would be great to track things like how much is used for the purchase of goods, how much people intend to hold until it reaches this price or that, how much has been lost etc. But there is just no way to know these things with Bitcoin. On the blockchain, a lost coin looks that same as a coin that someone is holding indefinitely. A coin moved to avoid capital controls can't be distinguished from a coin moved between a person's own two wallets. And so on.
It is maybe instructive to look at all the ways that people have tried (and failed) to project to gold prices based on all sorts of metrics. I think when you get to looking at a monetary commodity the unknowns are just so innumerable - it's an awesome, unpredictable force of nature.

Citation needed. Again, I'm talking bitcoin that isn't lost forever. How can anyone know?  Again, not that it matters, but the meaning of this figure is beside the question as to whether it even exists.


Of course you could. There are no shortages in a market economy. I'll be happy to sell you 1 BTC for ~~$8.2B~~ $4T.


Nope. As with gold, some numbers might be reported and you might even be able to inspect one "vault" or another. But the amount of dollars that exist isn't even remotely known.  Look into private-sector money creation - I found this seriously mind blowing:  
There is a flaw in your thinking that market cap somehow indicates the total value of the bitcoin. It doesn't. It doesn't even say how much USD has been used to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is not like a share of USD deposits somewhere. For example, suppose that this simplified scenario accounts for all the bitcoin in the world:
1. Alice mines 10 BTC.
2. Alice sells 1 BTC to Bob for $100
Wow, look the market cap is $1000, but only $100 USD ever changed hands.  What is the significance of "$1000" then? We don't know that Alice can sell her remaining 9 BTC for $900, because we don't know who might come forward to bid on 90% of the world's bitcoin. All we know is that one person recently bought *one* for $100.
Now suppose Alice loses 5 BTC when her laptop crashes, and nobody but her knows about it. What's the market cap now? Nobody knows, and nobody should care. 
In contrast, with company stock the market cap is quite meaningful. All shares have an owner on record, and all can be acquired if authorized by vote. We can decide what an enterprise should be worth based on its return on capital. And we can usually expect that a company could be fully acquired if someone were to offer roughly its total market cap in USD. Market cap is very meaningful when talking about stocks. But it means nothing with respect to a thinly held commodity.

It is volatile because it is thinly traded and has been working its way up from zero adoption, to still a quite small level of adoption. 
When you see it move by $100M of market cap, it doesn't mean that $100M was traded. Really there are a few million coin in strong hands, while people trade a few thousand per day back and forth through exchanges and merchants.
The case for higher value in the future is if you think an increasing number of people will want to use it as a store of value and medium of exchange. In that case people who want coins for such purposes will have to bid for them, and unlike fiat notes, there are only so many that can exist.

If the public market does NOT materialize then yes, the existing shareholders might have trouble liquidating. That text is a CYA disclaimer, which is of relevance only to the initial shareholders in case the plan fails. It doesn't reflect what GBTC *intends* to achieve.
What I expect to happen is that after the offering, wall st will bid up the price to some premium over NAV. This motivates the "authorized participants" to acquire more BTC and deposit it in the fund, which triggers the issuance of more shares. This is the mechanism that's supposed to pressure the market price towards 0.1x BTC.

In a free society based on sound money, the only way to make money is to offer something in trade - either the product of your labor, or something you acquired previously in trade.
In planned societies based on fiat currency, "money" is created at the pleasure of banks/government, either by printing paper notes or by editing accounts in a database.  Some people consider this legalized counterfeiting, or theft, as it is taking real value from everyone else who is forced to recognize those notes as currency. In the end you have men who produce nothing taking from men who do produce.

No. The price moves up when people bid higher prices, or when sellers are unwilling to sell at lower prices. It is whatever *value* at which bids and asks meet on the exchange. 
It is not any function of the *quantity* of bids and asks. You could have a million people bidding $1000/BTC, but that does not make the market price $1000 unless someone is willing to sell for that. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:37:26
By definition that's how it's calculated - last trade times number of units.
Furthermore for example, if there were 1000 coins and the last trade was at $1, then the market cap would by definition be $1000. 
But just because somebody paid $1 for 1, doesn't mean the other 999 are "worth" that. It's usually roughly true of stocks, but not commodities.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:26:59
Technically true, but misleading. Read the "interim financial report". The *fund itself* doesn't acquire more BTC, but they have designated an "authorized participant" (SecondMarket) who can do so. The authorized participant deposits BTC in the fund and receives newly issued shares in trade. Unlimited shares are authorized. It's just a little legal fiction on the back end to make it work like an ETF.
As to why there weren't new shares issued on the first day to satisfy the bids... someone pointed out that the $50 bid might not be "real". And the $20 bid is below market for the underlying. I'm thinking they're not going to rush to bootstrap this and will allow a few days for existing shareholders to put up some asks. Nobody really bothering to bid until the shares are available to trade, so I wouldn't read too much into the prices offered today.
Yes, the COIN ETF will be superior and it will also have a large properly underwritten IPO. But that's why it's taking longer.

I'm not an expert on this specifically but I've done some logic design. The hashing function is mostly *combinatorial* logic, i.e. you put a number on the input lines and wait for the answer to propagate through to the output. 
In between you are waiting for gates to flip. Each logic level change uses some energy. A smaller process (smaller transistors) is faster and more power efficient. Once we are making ASICs with the most advanced process we are probably approaching the limit in terms of H/s/W. 
It isn't outrageously complex like a modern pipelined CPU, so while there might be some opportunities to do the math more efficiently I think we are going to hit the limit of what is possible in terms of logic optimization very soon.
However there is still a huge way to come down in terms of $/H/s as production volumes increase and the technology becomes highly commodified. You can estimate the lower bound on this by looking at the price of a commodity IC such as DRAM - figure out what you're paying per square mm of silicon and that's about as cheap as a bitcoin ASIC can be.
I don't know how making the chips any cheaper or more efficient is going to get them in more people's hands though. Maybe when someone makes products to capture the waste heat (for heating / hot water) then they will be economical in the home. Otherwise a large farm will always have economies of scale in their favor.

Even if geologists knew how much there used to be on the surface, they can't say how much of that has been buried underneath a pyramid in Egypt never to be seen again. And as the MF Global case proved, even the holdings reported by a vault might be complete nonsense.
Secondly, we don't know how much is consumed in industry. Especially in the case of silver, it could be a lot, as it's used in solder and electrical contacts which go to the landfill and become irrecoverable. Some people suppose that the amount of above-ground silver is therefore far less than the amount of gold. There are guesstimates, but at the end of the day nobody knows when a bunch of metal is sold on the open market, whether it will be consumed in industry or buried in a vault. In either case, it stops circulating for who knows how long... it just disappears, so what's the point in counting it?
With Bitcoin we know exactly how much was mined but we don't know how much is circulating in trade, how much has been lost forever due to deaths or deleted wallets, etc. It's nearly impossible to tell what was used in a purchase versus what is being shuffled between the same individual's wallets. Market cap is simply the last trade on an exchange times the amount that has been mined. It does not have the same meaning as something like a public company where the whole entity has some value for which it can be acquired. 
Just because people put numbers on these things doesn't make them "well known", let alone meaningful.

Inflation. The price can only get ahead of the trend so far, before the fiat flowing out to miners becomes greater than the fiat flowing in from new speculators. This mechanism will always provide the dampening effect to correct a blow-off-top.
But... there is also inflation in the USD, in which we are pricing this commodity.  When USD fails, we'll have to price bitcoin in something else (wheat, oil, gold, etc) to have a meaningful measure.

OK if I must:
"Everything that **was** offered for sale at a lower price has been sold already. **Now** people who want bitcoin must pay a higher price to obtain it. "
And we can state the converse from the seller's perspective:
"Buyers have acquired all bitcoin that **was** for sale at a lower price. Sellers may **now** accept trades at a higher price."
Was vs now reflects the passage of time between a high price today vs a low price yesterday. Positive delta-price over delta-time means rising price.
You can easily invert these statements for a falling price if you like.
Edit: also just to be clear why the *number* of buyers vs sellers is not only irrelevant but also inestimable: I am personally both a buyer and a seller at any given time. At this moment I would sell bitcoin for $2000, and I would buy it for $1000. Since neither of these figures is the market-clearing price, at this instant in time, neither of my trades is being filled. But at any future time, either trade could be filled if the market were to move sufficiently.

Walls can also be a price manipulation tactic. When people see a huge wall they will put their orders in front of the wall, because they figure they won't be filled otherwise. This activity can push the price up or down.
...sometimes. If the wall keeps moving around then people will figure it isn't real and they will just place their orders at the price they expect to happen.

It's not trading yet, so ignore it.  Once it starts trading it is supposed target 0.1 x BTC.
The 0.1 ratio depends on traders not being idiots, and not bidding it up to a high premium over NAV before the fund can add more BTC. I wouldn't be surprised if that happens on the first day, and then it might take some time to settle down.

No, none of this has been tested that we know of. Also note that I edited my comment to say that like-kind is plausible.


Correct, but you have a gain/loss on A relative to when you bought A. The question is whether you should recognize it when trading A for B, or in the future when you ultimately trade B for dollars or a non-like-kind good.
In the barter scenario, the gain on A would be recognized when A is traded for B.
In the like-kind scenario, the gain would not be recognized, and B would assume the original basis from A. So you have an unrealized gain in B that carries forward to the next trade.
There has been no guidance from the IRS as to which scenario we must apply for crypto-to-crypto trading.

So you don't know, all you have is an upper bound. And you still haven't shown it means anything. You've only offered some hand-waving about a "relative level of interest".
I could show that the upper bound on gold reserves is 1E12 km3, as that is the volume of planet earth. 


Sorry I misread the units and responded as if you'd said $8.2B, not 8.2 BBTC. You misread my reply, too.
It's irrelevant as I was speaking to the principle that there can not be a shortage of BTC. But let's do the math again. So you're talking about $4T of deposits somewhere, and choosing to denominate this in terms of BTC? 
No you can't buy 8.2B BTC, but you most certainly can buy $4T worth of BTC. Again: I'll sell you 1 BTC for $4T. That trade would establish the market cap of Bitcoin at... let's see, 15.6M * $4T USD = **sixty-two quintillion, four hundred quadrillion USD**.  Wow. Now, what does that figure mean? 
A contrived case like this helps to illustrate why the concept of a commodity's "market cap" is useless. 


It is what you said. And you said it again just a few sentences later in your reply:


You're equating market cap to total value of deposits, like the sum of people's bank accounts. 
That's not how commodities work. They aren't deposit receipts, they are value *per se*. You can not value the sum of a commodity in existence based on some recent trades, because only a tiny fraction of that commodity is for sale at any given time.

This "intrinsic use" argument usually stems from Mises' regression theorem about the origin of money: 
One possibility is that Mises was simply (gasp!) wrong on this point. Bitcoin did become used as money almost immediately, despite having no prior non-monetary use. I guess the question is how long it will survive as such, and what we're really trying to figure out is how Bitcoin might differ from the usually short-lived paper instruments that have come and gone.
Consider gold - I think there's a misconception that anyone actually values gold for its non-monetary uses. The ancients thought it was pretty and they made jewelry out of it, but the jewelry itself was regarded as a store of value. They were just making nice stuff *out of money*. Central banks don't hold gold because they like the idea that it can be used for tooth filling or electrical contacts. They hold it because it's money! Actually society would benefit most by using a commodity that has *no* industrial uses, or else people would have to sacrifice those uses to the extent that the commodity is used as money.
Another way to think of this though, is that when we say "intrinsic", what we're really getting at is whether the market recognizes the money as being valuable *per se*, as opposed to being valued for something that is *extrinsic* to the unit of currency, such as a guarantee of redeemability for something else like gold or oil. Bitcoin fully satisfies *this* definition of "intrinsic" because nobody values it based on an external promise - it is not a note but a commodity. The value is nowhere but IN the commodity, therefore the value is intrinsic. This definition is well accepted in the context of numismatic coins, where we distinguish between melt value, face value, and collector value. Bitcoin has the equivalent of "melt value" and nothing else.
It's really exhausting to hear people parrot this "intrinsic value" term without being more clear as to what they're getting at. There are a lot of ways to attack that argument, but nobody seems to really understand what the argument is when it comes to bitcoin.

Pretty sure this is a liquidity event for the initial shareholders. The 12-month wait was PRIOR to qualifying for listing.

If we use the definition of Smith, Rand, the Austrian economists: Capitalism is *economic theory*. It's philosophy, which is to say an explanation of reality that is supported by percept and reason as opposed to faith. 
Each individual gets to choose his philosophy - how he will interact with the world. Whether to embrace objective reality and act in his rational self interest, or to follow the directives of a television, teacher, preacher, politician, or policeman. Every choice is preceded by philosophy.
Religions of course made an early attempt to figure this out long before Smith or even Aristotle, (thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, give only voluntarily, etc). But it took us a few thousand years to graduate to philosophy. For a long time we couldn't really show *why* force is evil, or even what evil is. Until very recently we tried to convince people to be civilized by simply ordering them to do it.
Just because you find some overlap between religious "morals" and capitalism, and just because religions are bullshit, it doesn't follow that capitalism is religion or capitalism is bullshit. If something is true, we might expect to arrive at some of the same conclusions by thousands of years of storytelling as we did through logic. If you're interested in religion, it can be fun and therapeutic to explore but just be sure to keep your thinking cap on.
The communists were right to oppose religion, but they were wrong to replace it with an equivalent diktat, ordering people to sacrifice themselves to the state or "community" instead of the church.

I believe that was the time from the private shareholders originally acquiring their interest until it could be sold to the public. They needed to first acquire some assets in order to be listed. Once public, apparently the trust can issue *new* shares according to its business plan. 
Like when a regular company goes public - it is both a liquidity event for the existing shareholders and an opportunity to raise new money by issuing new shares. In a big IPO you would have "market markers" distributing a large block of shares, whereas this will operate more like an ETF, issuing shares daily on demand.

Goat shit makes an excellent soil conditioner for new gardens, as well as established gardens. It improves the soil texture so it uses water more efficiently and allows more oxygen to reach the plants' roots. Goat shit, like all shit, offers a low-cost, natural source of nitrogen and other nutrients. Because goat shit contains small amounts of other nutrients, you will probably have to supplement it with other shit, depending on your soil shittiness. Spread 40 pounds of goat shit on a new garden and till to a depth of 8 inches. Spread 1 to 2 inches of shit annually on established beds and till under.

"Market cap" is ascribing a value to coins that people are holding (or perhaps have lost forever) based on a very small quantity of other coins that other people are trading. 
People think that this is meaningful for Bitcoin because of the way that it is meaningful for stocks. But Bitcoin is not a stock. Look into theories as to how people decide the value of income generating assets - there is a lot of talk about market cap or "enterprise value", but you will see that none of those ideas can be applied to monetary commodities.
Furthermore, we can not know what's going on in other people's heads. Joe's Bitcoin might be worth $10,000, or $100,000 to him, which is why he's not selling right now. Unlike a stock, nobody can force his hand to sell by a shareholder vote. 
Therefore, we can not meaningfully presume what any quantity of bitcoin is "worth" aside from what someone is willing to pay for that quantity in this instant.

These people have a way of telling us the truth even while they trick us.

That's a crude house for the price. Is that really what that goes for in Perth?

According to them:
"XBT Provider do not have any market risk. The company always hold bitcoins equivalent to the value of ETNs issued."
 
I think the prospectus language is CYA boilerplate allowing them to hold the bitcoin via exchanges. I agree this is much more loosely defined than something like the proposed COIN ETF, but it's plausible that they are indeed holding BTC to back the ETN.
