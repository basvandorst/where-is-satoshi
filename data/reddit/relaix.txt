The problem is there is no intrinsic value in Bitcoin. With gold you can create jewellery. 
Also gold is offline and not bound to anything like the internet or electronic devices.
It can be like 1 reichsmark. Maybe its scarce, but if no one believes in it anymore or it is unuseful because you have to bring 1 truck full of it to pay for something, then it's worthless. Especially if there are newer and better currencies people believe in.

the answer is: it doesn't matter, because i will buy some good crypto with it, that is not probably worthless like dollar or bitcoin in a few years.

Yeah. It is a "sure" scarcity that can not be replaced. You said it: There is a demand for jewelry. Gold can fulfill this demand pretty good, diamonds can do it better.
Bitcoin, Reichsmark, Dollar can not fit the demand for easy, secure, cheap, fast, unprintable and price stable currency anymore. Therefore other currencies will rise above.
But maybe there is a new solution for bitcoin that will solve it all and all demand is fullfilled by bitcoin. then it will be better than gold. But not now. Now it's just Myspace preparing the world for Facebook.

I do not want to discredit Bitcoin. I understand the Metcale's Law. But, this does not mean Bitcoin will not be a Myspace or Yahoo. 
You can not create new other metals that make gold obsolet. Therefore gold will keep it's value. Also Gold is a status symbol. Like Auwardamn said, people want gold jewelry because it is expensive AND a show of wealth. You can not wear bitcoins. You can buy something of bitcoins. The intrinsic factor is "more connected".
Gold will be there in 100 years and has it's value. Reichsmark, Bitcoin, Dollar, Myspace won't probably. They can be replaced.
