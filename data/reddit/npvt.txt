That is what I do!  You see what I buy then you sell the same.

I got in line.  19000 people ahead of me I think

I'm sorry you feel that way.  Our ancestors had not a cent to their name and lived happy contented lives.  Money is not everything. It is hardly anything.

Oooh I'm going there

Isn't Christie going to jail soon?  (being optimistic)

It depends on the amount.  Say someone gave me 1000 bitcoins to my address of 33434234324798234987234798938274 then I might be happy (note fake address!)

It works for me for my $39, no $45, no $37, no $42 dollars of Bitcoin

It probably would not be that expensive (if not large) and it would be a conversation piece. No place where it is easy to see though. Maybe the back shoulder.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:57:39
no, the value would keep going down.  Not a good idea unless you like tattoos
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:40:40
Yes but it might not be bitcoin.

I thought that was that dog coin.

$20 is 0.00347 Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:03:21
You can trade 10,000 in for Bitcoin.  I think that is about 2 dollars.

Lots of free electricity and custom designed ASIC such as ASICMiner Block Erupter USB 330MH/s Sapphire Miner 
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:55:30
maybe not custom designed. what would you suggest?
