Because its the reality of the situation. 
Do you really think Trump wouldnt do it?

So you think a good outcome is Trump pardoning himself? Why?

Dad why are we shoveling the snow off the lawn and lighting a bonfire to loosen the soil? 
Best time to plant a tree is now son.

Yes it is. Who has a spare few hundred bucks plus monthly plan laying around? 
Im sure many people could do it but why would you? Doesnt make economic sense.

I dont follow your logic... Do you think crimes should be forgiven or ignored once Trump is out off office?
Like we should ignore the shit he did when the new guy comes in? 
I dont like Trump but I dont want to ignore pedos because they are only an ex president and not standing. 
Besides... You do realize that if Trump is charged while in office that he can pardon himself, right?

I sent my friend 300$ in blockbuster stock but it lost value by the time I was able to get it out of the stock exchange and mail it to him.
We should abandon stocks.

Do you think his fans would interpret that as being so? I would rather see him charged and in jail that see him tell his believers that he is innocent and the pardon proves it. 


Yes I actually honestly think a large number of his supporters would still see him favorably. Especially if he spins it.
