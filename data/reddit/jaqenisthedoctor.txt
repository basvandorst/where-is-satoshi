Yes ad hominem attacks show you have the high ground.  Its cool you did so well with the other commenters.
p.s. I think the fact my proofreading was such crap shows that I actually spent hardly any time at all on that.  You deny you still belivev in buttcoin?  You deny you think regulation is dumb?  The title of your post was literally about becomng a millionaire due to getting screwed.

So wait you thought you were gonna become a millionaire through this and tben when easy money wasnt easy money wasnt easy money cause you literally did it in a place with no rules and no regulation.  You now want to sue and get your millions that way and have some accounability even though you’re still gonna come to thos thread where we warn about this sh** and sh**t on us for wanting regulation?  Not only that but still profess how great the “fundamentals” of buttcoin are?  Thats rich
Wake me when youve actually seen the light.

actually it has been unseasonably warm in my house and has been for a while.  I always have chocked it up to my plasma TV but it happens even when my TV is off.  I have monitoring tools for my temps and my GPU is always much warmer than I would like and I end up having to run Precision X to manually get the fans going.
I'll post what I posted below: Thanks for this I'll see what I can find.  I'm pretty sure I purchased like $75 or $150 USD worth of bitcoin back in feb or so of 2013 so like 1 or 2 bitcoin.  Then didn't do anything with it but I remember looking into bitcoin mining at the same time and had just purchased a GTX 680 4GB so that's why I was wondering about accidentally leaving it running.
Seriously sorry for the delay in response, have a bad head injury that causes memory loss so I forget that even post stuff sometimes.  Plus bitcoin depresses me seeing as how I wanted to purchase like 10-20 bitcoin at the time and didn't just like I didn't buy FB stock even though I had a chance when it first went public lol.
