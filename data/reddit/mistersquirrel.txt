Why downplay it so? 
Pest Control Report 2000 wasn't a mere "firework", it was an illegally manufactured explosive equal to approximately a quarter stick of dynamite... even the Missouri manufacturers were ordered to stop producing and distributing them. He was selling them on eBay and shipping them through the mail and package delivery services, without any special protections that would normally be used to ship such explosives...

Is there any way of knowing for sure how the prices are determined for a cryptocurrency, or by whom?

Yours are, if they are non-deterministic, but others are generated by hash algorithms, rather than by random number generators.
And your "wallet" necessarily consists of more than just the keys. The keys are utterly useless without the capability to construct and record transactions on the blockchain.
