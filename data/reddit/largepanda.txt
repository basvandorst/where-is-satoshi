Only sorta. They use a WebRTC protocol that is incompatable with the traditional BitTorrent protocol.

The problem is that any other way that anyone has thought of would require some level of centralization.

Blockchain.info runs multiple BitcoinJ nodes that appear to the network as multiple nodes even though they're only "technically" one node.

While Kraken should be supported, they're also very small with not much activity.

Just go buy a Nexus 5 from Google Play. It's pure Android, and while it is pricy, it's worth it.

It's been there since at least October 2013. You could probably go search through GitHub commits to find when it was first added.

I'm currently on the $30 T-Mobile prepaid plan (100 min talk, unlimited text/data, 5 GB HSPA+) and, if I was paying for it myself (work pays for it) I would love to be able to pay in bitcoin.


That is fucking $600. I don't have that kinda money laying around.

It would make more sense to just run a single node on your base PC, not in a VM. That way your computer doesn't get bogged down and neither does the node.

Can we just have the Bitcoin Foundation disband? I think that would be for the greater good.

Sorta. NASDAQ is, in addition to a collection of markets, a corporation (which is listed on itself) to manage the markets they run.

Bitcoin as a payment network vs as a currency.
If bitcoin is widely adopted, but everyone just cashes directly out to USD, what's the point?

1. In my area T-Mob HSPA+ vs LTE speeds are barely faster
2. Nexus 4, no LTE radio.
And yeah, definitely sounds like a scam.

I generally like free money.
Your servers handling the load okay?
