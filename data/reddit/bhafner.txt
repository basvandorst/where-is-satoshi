On blockchain.info, you can set the fee regime to "frugal" (which means it only includes a fee when really necessary), but it can slow down your transactions. I don't include any fee when sending bitcoins to relatives (when they don't mind waiting a little bit more...)

Now that chinese are massively buying bitcoins, **Amnesty International must accept Bitcoin donations**. They fight against oppressive regimes but can't accept donations from the citizens of these !
With Bitcoin, they can !

I think the idea of organized crime is controling a territory, to be the one who set the market price for what you sell (which can be crap, but you can sell it because you control a territory with a violent network). 
In Silk Road, you can't control a territory by violence, so you have to sell at an adaquate price/quality ratio.

I never pay fees on my bitcoin transactions and never had any problem...

Wow, I didn't know about "compressed bitcoin addresses". Thanks :-)
So blockchain.info new keypair api displays the compressed bitcoin address instead of the regular one.
Is there a reason ?

Exactly, so I think I could do this :
I prepare a transaction that goes to an address of mine (with high fee).
I broadcast this transaction right when you scan my code and send it to one of your addresses, with the standard fee.
My transaction has more chance to become the official transaction. I sort of paid the miner a fee for helping me rob you ;-)
You only realize a block later...

1 bitcoin = 100 000 000 satoshis
So, in total, there will be 2.1*10^15 satoshis, which means 300.000 satoshis per person.

It's  not an assumption, it's an objective fact that there is no **report** of a negative impact. Although I admit that's a little ambiguous...
@_date: 2013-10-16 11:51:25
Dans l'absolu, oui, mais vu le contexte je ne sais pas trop :
"Looks like you haven't made any transactions yet. Send someone some Bitcoin!";
"Il semblerait que vous n'ayez effectué aucune transaction. Envoyez quelques bitcoins à quelqu'un !";
"Il semblerait que vous n'ayez effectué aucune transaction. Envoyez des bitcoins à quelqu'un !";

Their answer was : "Dans les semaines qui suivent le paiement par bitcoins sera introduit en Belgique." which means "Bitcoin payments will be introduced in Belgium in the next few weeks"

**Paul Krugman** said this about the Internet and IT jobs back in 1998, so I woudn't trust him so much :
* The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in "Metcalfe's law"--which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants--becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.
* As the rate of technological change in computing slows, the number of jobs for IT specialists will decelerate, then actually turn down; ten years from now, the phrase information economy will sound silly.

Yes he does, because a few days after my post [here]( and the sentence "Bitcoins have been associated with illegal online activity such as money laundering." has been moved to the apporpriate section, someone puts **this** in the introduction!

Oui, mais pour les devises conventionnelles, nous utilisons des montants supérieurs à 1 dans la vie de tous les jours. Je dépense des euros, des dollars, et effectivement j'en dépense plusieurs. A 118 € le bitcoin, je dépense rarement **des** bitcoin**s**. 
In any fiat currency, we do over-one unit transactions in our everyday life. I rarely spend more than one bitcoin at a time...

On the "Internet" article, there is barely a mention of child pornography. Nobody knows that **internet has been linked to criminal activities such as child pornography, money laundering, terrorism, scamming, etc?** ;-)
**Someone should edit the Internet article that way (with sources - not hard to find) and when edited, say you're just following the path of  which seems to be sure he knows the editorial guideline of wikipedia!**
@_date: 2013-10-18 09:49:12
Recently, very good articles have been written by recognized media about Bitcoin. Those articles mention beneficial uses of Bitcoin, such as low-fee remittances, etc. 
Maybe we could use those articles to positively edit the article *the wikipedia way* ;-)

Right, I didn't think of that. I usally talk about Bitcoin to tech-savy friends, but a good allegory must be easily understood and have some consistency ;-) Thanks, I just edited my post!

I think it would have even more success on reality TV where you have to sometime vote for your favorite singer, dancer, etc. by SMS (It's common in EU, I don't know about the USA...). You would have a different bitcoin adress for each participant and vote by sending bitcoins.

In case anyone wonders, I know it's not an instrinsic property of Bitcoin, but the result of the use of mining pools, but I kept it simple for the sake of the argument.

Bonjour, pourquoi demander le pays si ce questionnaire ne concerne que les français ? En tant que belge, j'ai failli répondre au questionnaire, avant de lire l'introduction et de réaliser qu'il s'agissait d'un questionnaire destiné aux **français** ("Ceci est un sondage anonyme pour comprendre les motivations des Bitcoiners &amp; Miners français"). 
A moins qu'il ne s'agisse en fait d'un sondage pour les Bitcoiners et Miners francophones, auquel cas votre intro devrait sans doute être adaptée pour éviter de futures confusions.
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:36:41
No, the're not doing fine the way they've beeing doing for now. For instance, Amnesty International can't accept donations from many oppressive regimes. With Bitcoin, no one can block them!
