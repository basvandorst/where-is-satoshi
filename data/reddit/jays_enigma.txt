I invested thousands just before China shut down all the exchanges. Just sit the fuck down and hold it for a bit. IMHO

Other things that the Fed quantitative easing scooped up would be subprime car loans and student loans if you look up the real numbers on those neither markets are doing too hot. I'm not a negative person I just like to see real numbers.

Okay the problem is the system is a debt base system they can't unwind QE because it's mostly just shit things like mortgage-backed securities and if they raised the rates too much they're going to crash the currency. So in other words if they try to unwind their quantitative easing they're going to flood the market with all kinds of properties that will crash probably the business side and the residential side and if they raise the rate then the housing market cannot recover because the rates are going to be in the teens to get a loan for a house even with good credit. Raising rates also affects all of the types of credit.

Have you been watching the bond market? The FED is pretty much the only person buying bonds trying to keep the market from crashing the stock market follows the bond market. I mean I'm all for a real recovery but to be honest the action of the bond market for the last month or two is quite sobering.

The best part of this joke is where you said the feds are going to unwind QE and raise interest rates.
