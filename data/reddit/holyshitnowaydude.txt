Not yours, you are not owner of bitcoin.

I think I should take a break too. I spend way too many hours looking at charts and the price. Lets see how it goes.

@_date: 2017-03-07 01:55:56


Maybe I didn't explain it well,  but what I was trying to say was the nodes/clients are the rules and the miners have the choice and freedom to pick which client to mine with.
My second statement I described a 51% attack. The stronger the network the least likely this attack will occur and of course the scenario I described is terrible for bitcoin trust in security, but it can always happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:13:22
I have BU node running and I'm mining BU, so you statement is already false.

@_date: 2017-03-18 15:04:30
Wrong fact
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:05:13
There are two mistakes in your statement. 
1. Miners cannot make their own rules and print infinite coins and do what ever they want. They must follow a bitcoin client protocols of their choosing. Now if majority of the hashpower choose to validates blocks from client that allows them to print infinite coins then that would be the case 
2. Bitcoin's rules are NOT enforced by the economic majority via full nodes. Using your example from above, and I decide to release that client and run only one node. If majority of the hash power decides to validate blocks using only my node, bitcoin will start following my rules despite against the community and economic majority. Of course bitcoin price will then collapse lol.  
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:13:00
Whether you support BU or Core, at least action is being taken against this horrible stalemate. If Segwit was gaining traction I wouldn't be happy but at least a scaling solution would be implemented.  
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:20:08
Cool, thank god bitcoin isn't in the USA though. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:41:02
No not where I live, put I can put up with paying a bit to mine.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:07:44
Sure do it! Burn your stash "spamming the network" Miners will gladly take your fees. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:37:00
I think so, but you have to make that desicion yourself
PS. I love this trend 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:38:25
With the recent price drop and scaling debate in full force and recent BU awareness, miners are gonna have to start making decisions soon.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:59:14
 
BU- 32%
Segwit - 27%
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:16:57


That's a pretty ironic statement considering you are in a thread circle jerking about an easily manipulated online poll. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:16:57
He made a statement "no one wants unlimited". That statement is wrong because:
1. I want unlimited 
2. A lot of people on the other sub want unlimited as well

Wait luke wants to change the PoW? Lol sure piss off your biggest segwit supporter. 
And good luck with this PoW. As if any miner will vote this change in to make themselves irrelevant.

Go to the other sub and ask if they want BU.

I'm a troll because I support BU?? Explain how I'm trolling because I support a client that not favored by @_date: 2017-01-16 02:23:31
Still a loan regardless. What happens if bitcoin drops to $600, $400, $200? You can't pay him back, and you'll make a fool of yourself and harm your relationship with him. Also you'll just convince your dad that bitcoin is something to avoid permanently.  
Point is, you asked if this a good idea. I say no and stick with smaller purchases you can afford to lose 100%. To answer your second question QuadrigaCX is a good place to buy BTC for Canadians. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:34:35
I know it's rushed, but $1000 came sooner than i thought!
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:45:02
Looks like majority of that new hashing power is going to BU! Hopefully we reach 50%+ soon. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:11:37
I remember back in march/april the price was so stable the only moves that happened in BTC was because the loonie was recovering a bit.  
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:36:15
You mean a majority of the community.
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:07:17
Very bad decision sorry. Never buy BTC with loaned funds.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:32:23
Again with politics aside. Yes. Miners mine with the new client the old chain dies, never to be seen again. This can be done in less than 12 hours. Infact bitcoin hard forked twice both without problems, can't see why this would be different. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:28:49
The difficulty increase adjusted the time it takes to mine blocks back to 10 mins. Prior to the increase blocks were being mined faster than they should have. As for price, it should not affect it.     
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:19:47
You want to buy this??

From their Website:
Is QuadrigaCX regulated by the financial authorities?
As per FINTRAC, Canada's financial authority, Bitcoins are not currency, and therefore are not treated in the same way as currencies belonging to a nation. Therefore, QuadrigaCX is not required to report Bitcoin transactions to the Canadian government. With that said, QuadrigaCX is a registered member of FINTRAC and does comply with all existing anti money laundering regulations.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:22:54
The price went down to 6 cents briefly. If you had a bid for a 100 bitcoins there it would have costed you $6. Pretty awesome profit if I'd say so, but I don't a lot of coins were sold at that price.

More like saying  that you are losing a race you never entered.  
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:59:48
If YOU are not in control of the private key/wallet words you do not own you bitcoins. QuadrigaCX can perfectly secure, but they can for whatever reason decide not to give your coins back. 
With that said they did hold my coins for a couple months one time without a hitch, but I was stupid and would never do that again.

Awesome but be careful buying that coin. It's a futures bet that that BU will exist one day and might crash based upon undetermined news. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:44:22
They have previously but not under the right BU signalling tags I think . This time they changed it and are not signalling segwit.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:15:04
Thank you, this is something most users unfortunately don't understand. Btw 120TH is not a small operation lol, you got a nice size mining farm going on.

Meanwhile you are happy to see litecoin pump and fully support it's "growth". Hypocrite  
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:49:05
You make some good points but I see a lot of disconnect with the average users and miners. Statements such as Jihan is destroying Bitcoin and Miners are trying to control bitcoin really splits the community as a whole. I'm a miner and I have a node running and seeing these statements just hurts considering Miners take the highest risks investing in equiptment and mining is the official method of voicing your opinion on how bitcoin should move foward.

Are you really that brain dead? How can you say to someone to pay 20 cents in fees every time to a user who is interested in using Bitcoin. Might as well go back to using debit cards, fuck paying 20 cents for a dollar coffee. Its cheaper and quicker.  
@_date: 2016-10-23 04:05:28
Bitcoin needs to hardfork away from this 1mb limit. The longer Blockstreams stalls with their "softfork" the worse the situation is getting, driving users away.

@_date: 2017-05-14 01:30:02
That's great and all, except nodes don't determine what bitcoin is.

@_date: 2017-05-14 00:06:25
So now after network has clearly rejected to swallow the poison pill (segwit) you are deciding to force it up bitcoin ass regardless? I'm sure that one is going to work too!!! inb4 you remind me how Jihan and Roger are terrorists and are controlling the network to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:55:51

Core developers are really useless. Bitcoin survived many years without them, developers are a dime a dozen and any college grad can volunteer to help Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:16:40
You are really dense are you? 
Literally from the whitepaper conclusion chapter you quoted describes nodes vote with their CPU power. Node themselves do not fucking define consensus. They vote WITH CPU power which blocks they want to validate and they enforce consensus with the longest chain with the greatest proof of work! Therefore if BU nodes manage to VOTE with their CPU power and obtain the longest chain with the greatest proof of work, that becomes Bitcoin. It does not matter if there are 100 BU nodes or 100000.  
And to completely dispel your lies and propaganda explain to me if 80-95% of the nodes are running core/segwit, why do we not have segwit??    
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:34:47
The other option includes moving your money into altcoins. Which has been happening since March....But of course Luke will spin this as a good thing for bitcoin.

Really? Satoshi is incorrect now? 
"They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them."
