I just want human suffering to be at a minimum and part of the appeal of bitcoin is that it's a peaceful protest.

I'd prefer bitcoin doesn't rise at the expense of anyone but because of it's merit.

The point isn't about what you pay in one week bad week. If you believe in bitcoin fundamentals then even 20k could be a good price in the future. I bought at $1000 in 2014 with dollar cost average. But you do you....
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:56
I'll just hold until bitcoin has anonymous transactions.

@_date: 2016-03-02 15:25:42
If someone is attacking with transactions then the price increase should make it cost prohibitive to scale up. If these are attacks they should stop and the fees wil adjust accordingly. I think in the future microtransactions should be done off the block. If you moving $20 or more and have to pay ¢15 or less then shut the fuck up.

You can create online ID using a block-chain. People would earn credibility from there post similar to link Karma. This would add weight to there authority when deciding who's in charge.

Block-chain IDs to prevent fake spam trolls.

My point is not to promote block-chain but to point out that your average banker has little to be excited about.

This should logically destroy the idea that Core is the corporate takeover by the rich!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:36:04
True, but it worked when I did it. The only reason I did it was because I accidentally bought bitcoin using my bank instead of my USD account and didn't have the funds. As soon as the card was removed the transaction said failed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:12:03

They removed a bunch of reviews. I was at 900+ 1 star reviews and now they are at 800.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:36:33
Agree, what's a good alternative. 
Iv'e been with coinbase since 2013 and usually suggest people install their app to get started so they can easily get more without me. But if they are intentionally slowing down bitcoin to rip people off then I will start shopping. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:18:19

I agree but think that people are still stuck on the idea of 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:28:09
It totally worked for me. I think there may be a law about charging people after a payment method has been removed. I removed it within the first couple of hours.

I support it if it slows down that prick at bitmain. Can it be revised to block the possibility of ASICBOOST?
@_date: 2016-02-21 06:21:01
Sounds like you prefer quick solutions over best solutions. Politicians make quick shitty decisions. Being alarmist by saying it's too late isn't going to force the hand of people to make hasty/risky choices. Andreas is a bitcoin boss!!
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:03:14
What a bullshit reason. "So customers can remotely control their miners". This feature should have been disabled by default. Furthermore anyone who wanted to do this could set it up themselves with a computer they can remote into. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 06:49:15
Kesha is just an example.
But whats stopping an artist from moving to a different country and just distributing content online. They could live a very comfortable life and cut out bullshit from record labels. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:55:40
I think it's just damage control at this point. The fact that the sales of Antminers has dropped significantly due to attacking/bullying LTC and BTC. They are just desperate to remain relevant. I don't think we should give Bitmain a second chance and let the free market kill this POS of a company.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:15:38
Yes, unless it became a problem. Restaurants don't make you pay for food before eating and have an occasional 'dine and dash'. It's still worth it for customer convenience.

No, I've looked into it. They are a bunch of soy-boys living in their moms basement. They are certainly not fighting fascism by using fascist methods. When the group has members who need to hide their faces so that they can get away with breaking the law.

Marijuana have been both mainstream and illegal for a long time. So although you make some good points, I think governments can only slow progress. Worst case scenario would be if bitcoin was only used on the internet. Mainstream bitcoin will happen either way.

I honestly have no problem with having some centralized layers of bitcoin as long as there's multiple alternative lightning networks to use. The most important part is that bitcoin itself is decentralized. Easy solution is to just not keep the majority of your bitcoin in a lighting wallet. Use the lighting wallet for day to day transactions.

I personally think this started out to put to rest the idea that it's a myth that Jewish families control the media and the banks. With just a little research anyone with a brain can conclude this. The parentheses would show people these connections. Getting triggered and screaming Nazi is a gift to 4chan who wants everything to be considered racist. So far they have made the okay hand gesture racist, the peace sign trans-phobic, milk a sign of white power, pepe the frog racist ect....
