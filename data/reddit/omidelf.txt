So at the current moment, everyone will pay something around ~0.0008BTC for fee no matter how much they are transferring, correct?

So are you saying they should be identical in order to see a connection between them? can you teach us about some of the things you learned in the finance class?

So if there is a 80% chance it can be send less than 1 hour, then what is the maximum time?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:10:00
Guys what is the minimum Transaction fee right now?? 
based on mBTC? for example if i want to transfer 50$ how much should i pay for transaction fee minimum?
i just want an estimate, is it gonna be at least 4$? 20$? 50?!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:20:33
Holy shit, so for small miners who use Nicehash this is not profitable at all!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:34:26
So i'll probably spend around 5$ for transaction fee if i want the 50$ to be delivered in less than 1 hour, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:19:45
so how can i know what is the size of my transaction? how much i'm going to pay for fees for 100$?!
also how much electrum charges for transferring 100$? people talk about bytes when it comes to transferring fees but how should i know the byte?!
