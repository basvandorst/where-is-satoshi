Mining is a very fluid thing. You have a few fixed things like cost of electricity. But the other factors are unpredictable
-difficulty increase
-new hardware hash/watt/dollar performance
-coin price movements
Overall if you really keep up with the news you can make educated guesses.
But saying 6-7k is a floor is not necessarily true. If the next gen GPUs are incredibly efficient at mining, miners in countries with cheap electriciy would still break even even at 3k

Not impressed.
This cartoon is good to explain to a non techie person like your grandma but there should be additional levels that explain in detail how a block is validated and why proof of work ensures that only the main chain is valid.
If you read this and think "now I m an expert at crypto and blockchain" you probably do not have a scientific/engineer background because if you had you would realize these cartoons actually do not really explain WHY blockchain works but just describes its high level properties. 
This is fine for most people but it is defenitively not "to Expert"

BitCoin won't fail.
However it might be replaced by another coin which becomes more mainstream than Bitcoin and fall in the annals of history.

What’s this USD coin? Can you mine it? How does it work?

Don't worry, you will get your money eventually. This is a serious issue and I m sure they don't take this lightly. You can threaten them to publish your experience on SNS like facebook. If this goes viral, they ll go bankrupt.

when you look at how the 
wallet got filled up, you see a ton of tiny transactions.
Do they all come from nicehash wallets? How did the hacker do that?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:51:03
Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:51
Did you analyze where it comes from?
It comes from 
How were 4700 coins deposited there?
It looks like there were tons of small transacation.
What does this mean? The theory that nicehash had all their fund in a single wallet seems false...
I checked my NH-&gt; Exchange payments and the biggest wallet I saw only had 300,000k USD.
What does all of this mean? I have no clue

By then I hope we will be a type IV civ

Isn't the lesson that you should only move funds slowly? Like 10,000 USD at a time?

GDAX is not available in my country unfortunately.

It doesn t matter if you have unrealized PnL (hodling). You should pay taxes on mark to market.

If the gov was smart they would think about how to use the heat output of mining farms to grow some exotic crops in greenhouses. They would welcome these farms and invest more in renewables to power them.
Instead these brilliant politicians will ... tax them.

No, you have 50% probability of being positive and 50% of being negative. I don t understand why people don t get this.

Money = Debt
If you haven t watched this video yet you should. It has a very strong consiparcy theory flavor but raises some interesting questions.
