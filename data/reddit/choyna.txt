Thanks man, I didn't even consider Trezor!
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:52:18
Thanks for your reply! Unfortunately I don't have the disk space on my computer for the entire blockchain. I'm really looking for something that I can just store long term.
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:06:39
I do run a full bitcoin and lightning node on an rp3

@_date: 2019-11-27 15:43:32
Ah, thanks. I was thinking that.
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:27:15
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:13:17
Thanks so much for your reply! Tie to check out the Trezor too!
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:51:00
Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:53:00
I've not looked into Electrum. I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:42:00
For your long term storage?
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:55:51
Congrats man!

Thanks, I'll check out the link!

Just a quick question. What is the difference between an industrial SD card and the regular Samsung EVO 32GB SD card I already own. Is it worth purchasing the 2 x industrial SD card bundle? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:02:15
Thanks for the clarification. Time to take advantage of your Black Friday sale and step up my security practices!
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:31:01
Thanks for your reply!
@_date: 2019-03-31 07:01:40
Wow, tough crowd. Keep building ‘your’ portfolio my man ��
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:42:57
Thanks! Looking into Trezors now.
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:28:06
Thank you. Looks like they’re on back order :(
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:22:33
Thanks man, super helpful. More research!
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:51:51
What’s a good DCA alternative? I liked that Coinbase don’t charge for ACH deposits...
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:50:03
Haha... Your post just captured me a month ago...
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:01:27
Let me state that when I first jumped into this space, I ‘diversified’ thinking it would cover my bases. The more I learn, the more I increase my position in BTC only.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:59:23
Thanks guys. I appreciate your open and honest replies.
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:54:51
Looking forward to episode 2!
@_date: 2019-04-16 04:50:15
Thank you, I appreciate that!
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:11:20
Thank you very much for your reply, I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-04-15 02:30:26
Once again, thank you! Time to check this out.
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:49:30
Have you looked into Zap wallet? ([ TBH, I haven't used it but once my LN is funded I plan to give it a try...
@_date: 2019-04-15 02:02:17
That’s two suggestions for raspiblitz. Time to check this out, thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:36:51
Should I get a 500GB drive? Or a 1TB drive for the RaspiBlitz? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:08:36
Before I get too deep into this project, I can only allocate a maximum of around 500GB of data per month to the node. Is this feasible?
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:47:31
Thanks. I’ve heard this before. Is that covered in the raspiblitz guide?
@_date: 2019-04-29 21:00:01
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:50:25
Gotcha, thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:15:37
Thanks, I didn’t know!
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:58:34
Thank you!
I understand the advantages of setting up a Bitcoin full node. But why add a Lightning node?
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:01:29
Hey guys, two more quick questions. What amount of data should I expect the full node to use per month (both upload and download)? And I’m about to connect my laptop directly to my router and run a speed test, do you know the minimum upload and download speeds are required for the full node?
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:05:36
Thank you for your reply. I only use an old MacBook Air from 2013 with a 128GB hard drive that I share with my wife (separate logins) so I don’t know if that would work?
@_date: 2019-01-26 04:13:44
Thank you all very much for your input! I have a lot of reading to do based on your comments. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:54:01
Thank you, I’ll take a look next!
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:29:42
Thank you for your informative reply! This information really is good for thought. I’ll start by checking out your links and researching further. Thanks again!
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:07:38
Thank you, I’ll look into Electrum too. Do you know how much data I would need on average per month this route? I assume I would need around 200GB per month to run a full node on a Raspberry Pi setup?
@_date: 2019-01-25 04:09:15
From what I cal tell, I would need to purchase a satellite?
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:13:05
I was thinking of purchasing a 1TB drive with the Raspberry Pi for some future proofing.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:26:27
Nice one man, thanks. Loving the ride!
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:21:13
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:28:00
Sweet man, thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:30:52
You can setup a 24/7 Bitcoin Node &amp; Lightning Node on a Raspberry Pi with a 1TB external hard drive. I’m not technically minded at all, but by setting up a RaspiBlitz (using the excellent guide on Github) I was up &amp; running in a couple of days and never looked back. 
We also have a great RaspiBlitz community on Telegram to help you with any questions and connect as peers &amp; open channels. Do it, you won’t regret it. 
Here’s the complete walkthrough from the creator rootzoll, who also makes himself available if you need assistance: 
Come ride the lightning! ⚡️
@_date: 2019-05-23 04:24:41
I can’t argue with that ��
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:48:02
Agreed. My RaspiBlitz is almost ready to be funded and start opening channels, Rootzoll has been really helpful during the entire build process!
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:38:22
If you're talking about Autopilot, I'm not a big fan of it at the moment. It still needs more development. I prefer to open channels with people I know, not personally but through social media and forums just so I can contact a node operator if their node goes offline.
Here's a great guide which may help: [Lightning Node Management](
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:26:26
That’s a great decision. Let me know if I can help in any way!
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:32:34
Rootzoll created RaspiBlitz to enable you to get setup without having to delve deep into the command line. Once you’ve downloaded and installed the software package, you’re walked through the whole process. Although the screen is useful (but not absolutely necessary), you will need to know how to ssh into your Pi from a computer on your home network. PM me if I can further help.
