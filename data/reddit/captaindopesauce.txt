Much better song. Not just because I think the original is trash but a lot of the hooks are just more difficult to articulate as clearly, and he’s still got much better flow at that.

holy shit what?
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:49:10
It truly is. I’ve got a few crypto stained glass pieces that I’ve made, some of which took massive downvotes for no real apparent reason, and some shit talking as well. Keep creating man!
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:24:04
Who are you (or anyone) to judge his taste in art? 
Edit: as an artist myself, the downvotes are hilarious Ahahahaha. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:32:12
The negativity is hilarious
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:09:47
This would be a more lyricly impressive song simply because of the slight extension of vocabulary required to know what hodl means.

Ahah I like this.

I can’t say that they are, but I was under the impression that a digital asset is nothing more than it is- an asset that belongs to you that is digital- legitimately no different that a digital piece of art that you create, so it all kind of goes back my point of selling your own assets. Digital or not, if you own the asset, you own the asset, no?

Ultimately what I think I’m trying to get at is why isn’t the worst thing they can do for the time being, is hit her with a huge tax bill? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:33:03
This at least makes some sense to me then, thinking about it like that- that she was acting as an exchange, not selling hers personally. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:24:04
Right, but when was Bitcoin deemed a security? As far as I was aware, politically in the US, Bitcoin was deemed an asset, not a security, not a utility, not a currency, which is why we pay capital gains tax on it: it’s our property. So technically since it’s property, if you personally hold the private keys, it’s personal property, no? If only you can access them, it’s not personal property?

“Play money” is a good way to put it unfortunately, reading the bank rules in the Monopoly game sounds awfully similar to our banking system.

And I’m sure all of that can be insanely maddening, getting any spam calls drive me insane but still, none of those result in going to prison! 
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:19:12
RoboKiller provides some entertaining “bots” for the spam callers to talk to as it records the call for your listening pleasure later. 
I haven’t talked to a spam caller in a couple of months, but I’ve enjoyed listening to their aggravation.

You can scam all day as long as you aren’t selling your BTC in public I guess 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:17:17
Exactly! I mean I just want to know how someone somewhere under some technicality makes sense of this. I mean is it because of the amount of money she made? Who’s to say there aren’t people out there making a living selling shit on Craigslist? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:18:17
This at least makes a little more sense, since nobody outside of the crypto community believes that banks are the biggest money launderers anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:38:28
Thanks! Got me curious about this idea now though ha

FUDers watched their profits deminish
While the hodlers sat and chuckled
They pray aloud for one more wish
That the price would once more crumble

It’s actually stained glass, but I appreciate the kind words!

Not to change the location, but my brother went to Amsterdam for a week and ran out of EUR. It was going to cost somewhere around $50 USD in fees to withdraw more EUR while over there, and instead used a Bitcoin ATM and paid roughly 1.50 EUR to withdraw 400 EUR.

Well according to the article, it’s a sacred relic for the Bitcoin Embassy lol����‍♂️
But it’s actually a stained glass piece, I’d say probably a 7.5” diameter. I didn’t measure it yet, honestly I finished it just last night, took a couple photos and went to bed.

You know after the fact I tried, the chain isn’t long enough to fit my big ass head.

Citizens Bank is pretty friendly but at least on coinbase they charge a “foreign atm fee” if you use a debit card for purchase. But I’ve talked to a couple of the bankers at my branch regarding and they both think it’s interesting although not invested. Never had any actual issues purchasing or withdrawing, no phone calls. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:37:26
It is! Proper training and equipment go a long way lol. Just got a new ring saw, it was something quick that tested it out to show what it could do. It turned out well enough I think
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:36:21
I’ve only got one other picture from this piece, but honestly I’m so new to reddit that I don’t know how to post a picture, in a discussion lol

Can you hear the church coir? Ah ha
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:00:07
You did what I was afraid to do- I was afraid that if I split the pieces too many times that it would take away from the visual- obviously I was wrong. Yours is beautiful! 
I’ve been dying for a saw for awhile- and as much as I love it and as easily as it makes some pieces, there’s no substitute for the creativity it takes to make a piece happen without one!

The Tesla would’ve been drastically better if it had been built by a group of people who actually know what a car is, and not by a group of people who all came out with their own parts and smashed them all together at the end. If you’ve ever tried to work on them, you can tell within the first few minutes that it’s not built like a car should be in any way, the i8 is an easier car to work on and it takes two people to open the hood (not that you should be under there unless you’re positive you know what you’re doing, but that’s another mess.)

I feel like if someone has their life savings invested in crypto, much less any exchange. Unless you own the private keys it’s not yours, it’s just in your file per say. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:23:50
Bad idea bringing that up here

If you have any sort of religious knowledge, sometimes, although invested, I can’t help but wonder if Bitcoin might turn out to be the mark of the beast lol.
