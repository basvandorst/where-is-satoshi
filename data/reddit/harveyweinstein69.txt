This whole thing is a fucking scam. From top to bottom everyone's being ripped off over something which has no inherent value.  It's only worth anything because people believe it MIGHT be worth more in the future.
And don't bother comparing it to the dollar which is a shakedown as well but at least it's not entirely fraudulent.
This will go down as one of the greatest frauds in history.  The currency aspect anyways...

Exactly, no. Does it share the same qualities. Absolutely.

Bitcoin is exactly like a pyramid scheme.  Even it's advocates agree that it's a bubble. So buying g into it is like a game of hot potatoe.  Blockchain will change the way the internet works but crypto as a currency is destined to fail.

The best is "it's a healthy correction".
If healthy correction means coordinated assault on the price, yeah sure it's a correction.
If correction means everyone just up and decides to sell on the same day is a correction sure. It's a correction all right.
Correction Is a term used to make bagholders feel better about their perceived losses.  That's all it is.  A bunch of people got rich off this "dip."  It just wasn't the average investor.

You think not being regulationa on crypto is going to prevent us from being butt raped? Crypto is taking a shit and nobody can average down or sell off because the biggest exchange was shutdown.
Spoiler alert: this WILL get regulated.  And we'll still get fucked after it gets regulations. Only difference is right now none of the banksters are going to jail for anything they do.

Yeah shiny pebbles and green paper are better than paying a 20 dollar transaction fee to buy a slice of pizza.  And at least the world knows what the fuck it is and recognizes that it at least represents value.

I think fundamentally we probably agree on alot.
But I don't think the government would ever allow this to function the way its visioned in a perfect utopia.  I honestly don't even believe that the government would allow this to continue even a day longer unless it was benefitting the monetary elite that it serves.
In all likelyhood bitcoin could have been some CIA scam to steal the average Joe's retirement without bankrupting the rest of the market.
I'll say that I hope you're right.  I hope this all works out and nobody gets screwed and the alternative options to conventional currency end up being a good thing.  I'm way too cynical to believe that this is the case. 
Full disclosure? I'm an investor in several cryptoa because despite the flaws I think as a trader money can be made and the theory behind all of this will serve major purpose down the line in other ways.

More like a ponzi scheme actually.  But it's digital number which it's only perceived value besides a money laundering tool, is the IDEA that one can make money buying into any level other than the top.       Basically get in and out before the jig is up.
Let me ask you something. Where is the value in bitcoin? What makes it different than any of the other hundred currencies out there? What makes it better or worth it's massive value over the others? Does the tech really justify it? Because it seems to me as far as Blockchain goes other cryptos are doing far better work.
So why the valuation on bitcoin? Because it's become massively speculative and hopeful people are looking to make a dollar on it rather than use it as an actual currency.  It's useless as a currency and the creator himself said it.  I'm not here to stop you from drinking the Kool aid, on the contrary... Someone aware of what's going on, in this volatility, at this time can make a ton of money.  I'm an investor, but bitcoin is a ponzi scheme bubble, which may or may not be engineered.
