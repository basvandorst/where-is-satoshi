What if they already sent the lightning payment to the seller. Can they reverse it? This is the gist of my question.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:44:58
Correct. But the idea is that both parties trust the credit card company to be the ultimate arbitrator in this dispute. And the company has absolute power to reverse any transaction based on its finding. This is a process borne by the market that most people are very comfortable with.

"We" don't "need" anything. If you don't want to use it you're free to make irreversible transactions. The question was whether this exists as an option, because like it or not most people prefer it (and probably should have it because they don't know what they're doing. Even experianced bitcoiners often slip up and lose their coins.)
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:46:15
Yes. By often I meant on a worldwide scale. Not that it often happens to each bitcoiner. Poor choice of words on my part.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:58:51
Interesting point. This does resolve the dispute resolution problem, but people still won't keep their savings on a BTC exchange without some sort of guarantee that if the exchange is hacked their balance will still be honored. 
This could theoretically be achieved with insurance -- a la FDIC -- without any changes to the protocol, but in practice such insurance will be very expensive and there's no guarantee the insurance company itself won't go bankrupt if the heist is big enough.
Like it or not, one major advantage of the dollar and legacy banking system is that nearly every trasnaction is reversable via rule of law. Of course this leads to a myriad of other problems (which bitcoin solves), but without this peace of mind an overwhelming majority of people will not make the switch.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:52:34
This is unfortunate. Until bitcoin can offer those technically illiterate the same 100% guarantee against fraud that mainstream banks and credit card companies do -- lightning or no lightning we're not gonna replace paypal, visa, the banking system or the dollar. 
Irreversible transactions are great for many things, but most people prefer the safety and comfort of reversible transactions by reputable institutions.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:49:26
This is incorrect. There was no USAF. The mere threat of one was enough to bring the miners into line.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:40:21
The problem with that is it would make a bitcoin intermediary much more expensive than a legacy one. When Amazon or e-bay give you about refund, they are debiting it from the seller's account. If b-bay has to cover the expense themselves, they will have to charge higher fees, and be at a huge competitive disadvantage.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:20:26
Hopefully. Because that's the only way we're overtaking PayPal.

Question: Is it possible for lightning transactions to be reversible by one trusted party -- if all parties involved initially agree that this trusted party can reverse transactions at will?
I'm asking because a lot of non-techie people will never keep savings in Bitcoin because they believe it can be hacked and stolen if not stored properly (which is absolutely true, like it or not), and they'll never use it to buy anything because every transaction is final, so there's no way to recoup their funds if, say, an item they ordered never arrived. But these people are happy to keep their money in banks and use credit cards because they know that if any fraudulent tranaction happens it can easily be reversed.
So if a trusted third party with a hard-earned reputation can advertise financial services to the mainstream public with the guarantee that even if they are the victim of fraud they can reverse the tranactions at will (obviously for a limited period of time), with them being the sole arbitrators of any dispute (between, say, a merchant and buyer -- like credit card companies do regularly), then i can see people like my parents switching over.

Now how's that for a 21st Century headline!?

@_date: 2015-07-14 23:26:33
This worked for me too. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:14:34
Thanks. Forgive my ignorance, but the coins were sent to a different address on the new phone. However the seed is the same. Are you recommending that I re-install Mycelium, create a new seed and transfer the coins there? Do you mind explaining why?
Also, if the entire source code can't be audited. Is there a possibility - however remote - that the creators of Mycelium have a secret exploit that they can use to steal users' coins and disappear?
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:17:42
Do you mind explaining why a hardware wallet is more secure than Mycelium on an encrypted phone?
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:22:15
Mycelium definitely generates multiple private keys per wallet. Every time you deposit coins it generates a new private key. I don't know if that is what you are referring to, or if multi-sig is something more.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:20:26
Ok thanks, will do. 
Do you mind addressing my second question as well: if the entire source code can't be audited. Is there a possibility - however remote - that the creators of Mycelium have a secret exploit that they can use to steal users' coins and disappear?
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:04:02
I see. And is the Trezor's software completely open source?
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:18:32
Can you explain to me what multi-sig is and why it makes the coins safer?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:50:47
Abe and Bob do not know each other. They do not live in the same state. They do not even know that the other one exists. And they do not know that there is another person -- let alone who -- with the other half of their seed.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:36:17
It's not a password. The 24 words are generated randomly by a computer, and your private keys are all derived from this "seed."
If the 24 words are not completely random, or if anyone obtains them, someone will have your private keys and therefore all your bitcoin.
The point of this seed is to put in a safe place as backup in case you lose your hardware (or mobile app) wallet -- you can reconstruct it with all its private keys from this seed.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:53:16
So having half of a 24 word seed is the brute force equivalent of having none of a 12 word seed (even though both seeds represent a private key of the exact same size). Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:08:42
I'm not very concerned about scenario A. Because will only be an issue if I and one of them die at exactly the same time. Scenario B is almost comically unlikely. Scenario C is the reason I made this post, and from what I understand from the responses it is also impossible to brute force.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:34:02
Care to explain why?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:47:50
Just to clarify a bit more -- do the 12 words that he has mean he has half the private key? Or It doesn't work that way?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:24:06
Yes. Very.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:29:14
I will not tell anyone in my family about this. Just Abe and Bob.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:33:36
Thanks for the response. This is helpful information.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:06:01
The question is should I report it and try to explain it (and if yes, how?), or just ignore it and try to explain it if I get audited?
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:54:00
So this is the point of my question: Should I A. Go ahead and report the transfer on my tax return, and then try to explain to them that it wasn't actually a taxable event, or B. ignore it because I know it wasn't a taxable event, and then risk getting audited?
Is there even a way to do option A if I wanted to?
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:34:18
Agreed. I just can't believe this isn't the case already.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:02:34
Thanks for the reply. Do I actually have to declare all my "holdings" on my U.S. tax return? I was under the impression that only income needs to be reported. 
Also, my main question is whether the IRS will consider the transfer out of Coinbase as a taxable event, and if yes, whether and how can I explain to them that it wasn't.
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:01:58
This is very interesting.. I'll definitely look into this
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:23:53
Fascinating. Thank you.

"If you were to ask me which of the two following events is going to have more consequence monetarily in the future: bitcoins or Larry Summers' decision not to compete for the job of Fed [Federal Reserve] chairman," Dyer says, "it's probably the Larry Summers story and not bitcoins."  
This statement will be hilarious in 50 years. Probably on some kind of top 10 list for foolish predictions and ridiculous shortsightedness by today's "academics."
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:58:00
Thanks for the tip. I actually don't plan on using one, it's just a hypothetical question so I can understand the mechanisms of Bitcoin.
I'm here because I was explaining Bitcoin to a friend last night and got stuck on these issues. I realized I myself didn't fully understand how it works.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:07:41
But if I want to spend my coins, how does the network know it's me without me revealing my private key?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:04:59
Thanks!
