[The Rise and Fall of Enron](
[The Rise and Fall of The Simpsons](
[The Rise and Fall of Subway](
History repeating itself. Or common clickbait headline that is used for everything. Just because Apple recovered from their slump is not any indication that Bitcoin will recover. As you can see here, Enron didn't recover and The Simpsons is still on TV. The only thing that Bitcoin article and the apple article share is "the rise and fall of" in the headline, which is meaningless. You might as well be comparing the fact that both Apple and Bitcoin use the color yellow in their logos.

Writing in a joke vote wastes poll workers time and therefore wastes taxpayer money. Millions of people do this every election and poll workers are forced to tally votes for Bart Simpson and Bruce Wayne just in case there actually is a Bart Simpson running for office. It wastes taxpayer funds just so you can chuckle in the booth. Should taxpayer money be spent just so I can have a two second chuckle?

Do you visit when the price spikes? Bitcoiners were invading buttcoin like crazy when the price spiked up to the 7k mark, then they all disappeared when the price took a nosedive. There are still some salty bitcoiners around, but the great majority of them are deathly silent since the price crash. Same thing happens in reverse: when Bitcoin crashes, buttcoiners invade cryptocurrency subs to gloat, when the price increases, bitcoiners invade buttcoiners to gloat. It's human pride. 
And last, without checking the post history of every person who posts, how can you tell the difference between a buttcoin subscriber and a capitulating Bitcoin trader? Even the people here are starting to say things about Bitcoin that buttcoin has said for years: "high fees, slow transactions", "drug buyers are using Bitcoin the way it was intended: as a currency", "all my coins got stolen because I didn't follow a 35 step security guide", "oh no this exchange exit scammed why didn't anyone warn us like buttcoin has been doing for months", etc.

Lmao are you kidding me? You fully expect the US to 1) crash due to the USD 2) reform as a communist utopia and 3) use Bitcoin? How many wizards were involved in this fantasy because even IF this was to happen, it would take decades, first to dispel all fear of communism, second for the USD to crash, which (let's face it) would utterly devastate the economy and last for people to agree to weath redistribution. Obama couldn't even get Obamacare passed without people calling him a Marxist. But you expect that these same people who are chanting that communists deserve death will change their mind? 
The big social movement right now is for socialism, not communism. You're betting on a pipe dream hah. Wow you cryptocurrency people are weird.


Yep. The last communist country crashed and burned back in the 80s and took millions of lives with it. You just expect Americans will forget that? They can't even forget that long enough to vote for Bernie Sanders and his democratic socialism because people irrationally fear anything that even remotely sounds like communism no matter how radically different it is.

If people litter and they can stop littering, they should. 
This is my point: if people can stop writing in juveline jokes on votes that cost real taxpayer money to count, they should stop joking around in voting booths. 
It's my personal responsibility as an adult and as a responsible citizen to not cost the government money for unnecessary things (like littering or joking in write-ins). This is part of being a responsible adult. For instance, it costs money to send emergency services to anywhere in response to a 911 call. This is why it's a crime to call in a false report to the police. Therefore, you shouldn't call in prank calls to 911.
If you can't understand this, then don't bother replying. 


So you ignore problems and hope someone, somewhere comes up with a better solution. 
Not you though. You have no responsibility to try to help clean up the planet you live on. Nah it's someone else's responsibility to do that.

Until something negative happens to expose your conspiracy theory (like the downfall of the government), why would the average Joe using his debit card at Starbucks care?
Second point: if the government and entire banking system go down in flames like it did in Zimbabwe, did they turn to Bitcoin? Nope, they turned to a more stable fiat (USD ironically lol). Same thing is happening in Venezuela. Fiat is the only accepted currency on the ground and Bitcoin is used solely to import money into the country to then be withdrawn as fiat for everyday use. It's literally only being used to get around international monetary regulation (a felony).
You want people to jump behind Bitcoin because of what basically amounts to a banking conspiracy theory and you wonder why no one cares. Bitcoin is difficult to set up, it's difficult to use, in order to solve that difficulty you need to use a different tech AND it's fallen $1,000+ in 24 hours and then you wonder why no one gives a shit about your internet funbux.

Until it's as easy as using my debit card, Bitcoin will never reach mass adoption. Until it has payment protection, it will never reach mass adoption. Then, if you're just going to duplicate MasterCard or Visa, why bother using Bitcoin when I already use MasterCard and visa?
Btw, Bitcoin has fallen $1,000 in 24 hours. Until this shit stops it will never reach mass adoption because purchasing power should not change in 24 hours. We've reached Zimbabwe levels of inflation lmao. I thought evil fiat was the only thing that lost value?

From him: if you are not going to vote for a real person, don't waste time and money writing in a joke name. He's had to record Bruce Wayne, Bart Simpson and countless other joke names because someone might actually have that real name and want that vote.

This is a radically different thing. You're comparing apples to oranges no wonder you believe in Bitcoin lmao. Bitcoiners tend to be pretty uninformed about economics and you're a prime example. 
Bitcoin fell again btw. How far will it fall?


Hahahahahaha. Why would the government adopt Bitcoin instead of just making their own? Sweden just did and they call it the e-Krona. Why wouldn't all governments do this? Bitcoin is a nightmare for law enforcement, why would they willingly adopt it? C'mon man use your head.
Besides, this just shifts the problem. If the government was in control of Bitcoin and banks came along to adopt it, they're still going to turn around and loan it to people. With the number of Bitcoin finite, the supply continues to go down which drives up the price of each coin. Debt becomes a hole you can never dig yourself out of because if I borrow 1 BTC to buy a car, I may end up owing the equivilant of 2, 3 or even 4 BTC to pay it off depending on how long the term is. That's insane. Inflationary currencies are better for debtors, worse for savers. Bitcoin is great for savers but horrible for debtors and until income inequality is fixed by making everything free, debt will be a part of human existence.

So now someone else on the street sees me tossing trash onto the ground, so he tosses trash onto the ground.

�� People didn't give a shit about Bitcoin when it was worth nothing. No one accepted is for payment when it was worth nothing (because it's worth nothing). When the speculation bubble came along, people started to care and some merchants started accepting it because it was worth something. After the price crashed back down, the merchants stopped caring because Bitcoin is an insanely slow and cumbersome currency in general. 
But you say normal people will start caring some day. Why? What incentive do they have to care about it if it drops down to, let's say $1/coin?

Also, credit card companies don't want to be stuck with huge fraud bills, so they have automatic risk detection in place and maximum allowable credit charges before being flagged. For instance, if a thief steals my card and tries to buy a $5,000 TV and a $10,000 surround system, my card may automatically be shut off by the issuer because of high suspicious purchases outside of my normal spending habits. 
One of my credit cards even has an option to send me text alerts when a single purchase exceeds a set amount. And beyond all that I'm guaranteed against fraud by simply reporting it and I get my money back.

So the "other variables" are "I wanna have a chuckle" so he first throws away a vote (could have written in a real name instead of a fake one), he wastes government worker time (and therefore tax money) to tally a joke vote and last is acting like a child joking on a voting ballot instead of voting like he's supposed to. 
Just because I don't acknowledge your point as valid does not mean you ever had a point. If I'm arguing with a flat earther, I'm never once going to acknowledge that any of their views about the flat Earth are true because they're just *objectively wrong*. Same thing here. You're arguing that wasting tax money is good because he got seven karma on Reddit and got a picture to send on Snapchat as well as a small chuckle to himself. I'm saying voting should be taken seriously and stop wasting taxpayer money to count joke votes (which is also the guidelines for write-ins: you are not supposed to use the write-ins for jokes).

You only half understand the crash. If it was due to fractional reserve banking then why didn't this happen until 2008? What happened between 1933 and 2008 that suddenly caused the crash?
Mortgage backed securities happened. Fractional reserve banking had nothing to do with the crash. What actually happened is large banks were allowed to gamble on mortgage futures, subprime mortgages were given out like candy and the ensuing price bubble popped causing all those mortgages to go bad and then the banks found their massive profits had changed to massive liabilities. Then there was the fraud aspects of the billion dollar toxic mortgage package by BofA towards Merryl Lynch (as I remember), etc etc. This was also due to the repeal of Glass--Steagel in the late 90s under Clinton that allowed banks to even start this process of buying and selling securities, which was put back into place under Obama before Trump repealed it.

You're comparing a financial instrument with the entire concept of capitalism and banking. This is like saying the fact that a car is made out of metal is the reason that the transmission failed. Absolutely nothing changed about fiat from 2007 to today. It's still the exact same system as it was before. However, several regulations were put into place and even a new government office was created due to the crash. Fiat didn't change at all, it's still the same fiat it was 50 years ago. You don't know what you're talking about. 


This is what I don't get about you guys. You freely admit this is a bubble and you are taking advantage of other people but you fail to see a problem with that. This is insanely unethical behavior but you just freely admit to it. I guess morality doesn't survive libertarianism. 


If the USD collapses, so does the government. In this new collapsed nation with a ravaged economy, massive unemployment, riots, mass violence and food shortages, where is the government? Does the government reform, using Bitcoin to pay soldiers so they protect your house from robbers? Or does the entire justice system collapse and it's Mad Max levels of violence?
Either you have a government operating on some kind of currency or you have no government. Which is it? Soldiers and police don't work for free, so I don't know where law enforcement would come from after the USD implodes in your fantasy.


Ok, so answer me this: how do you get rid of debt? A huge majority of people cannot afford $100k-$500k for a home. Most people can't buy a car with saved cash. Some people can't even afford groceries and have to get payday loans to pay their bills. How does Bitcoin fix this?
