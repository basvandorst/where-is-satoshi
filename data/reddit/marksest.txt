I'm glad I'm not the only one who found their process concerning. I also sent an email and received a half assed reply, also from Roman. It's a shame since their deposit system is far superior to any of their competitors. What other services are you looking into?

I am not at at all prepared to lose the account. Looks like I'll have to hold off on bitfloor.

It seems so bizarre to ask for such potentially sensitive information over such insecure means. I've never seen it requested in this fashion until discovering bitcoins. How are you finding Bitfloor in comparison to MtGox?

I apologize for not making myself clear, I'm referring to making withdrawals. Have you done ACH verification?

Definitely bitfloor. Far easier and faster to deposit.

I agree. Bitfloor seems cleaner and faster but I can't be expected to compromise my security like that. Looks like I'll be going with MtGox. Thanks for the info, in your other comment I assumed MtGox had you email it as well.

Wouldn't I need to send the key along with the encrypted file? Seems to defeat the purpose.

Thanks for the input! I have reservations about MtGox, it seems too volatile and unstable, and has inferior transfer options. It seems that myself and others have asked about alternative methods of upload, and have all received unhelpful replies. I think I'll have to give MtGox a try. Thanks again for your input and your experiences.

I'm fine with that, emailing it is what primarily concerns me.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:09:10
Of course. I'd appreciate if you'd do the same!

[Here's]( a slightly tweaked one.
