Yes we did. We will be retesting it as support in the upcoming weeks then might bounce around that range for a month or so before another move.

Just send him the bitcoin. If he really wants to cash it then he will need to go through the process. 
Or you can send him cash via Zelle or CashApp and you can just keep your bitcoin lol

Check the chart. Heading towards mid 3000s maybe not sub 3k but we ARE gonna test 3500 
“Here we are looking at a possible 'massive' bear scenario also known as a 'Short-Sale Structure'. In this scenario we have 10 steps which pattern should follow through. At this phase Bitcoin has followed 9 out of 10 total steps. Scary... right? Well, as we move on further we see that potential target area if this bearish scenario was to validate would be in the territory of $3,550 - $3,400 range. 
This pattern is one of the most vicious ones out there because it can blind even professional traders and TA analysts. As if we begin to zoom out, you'll discover that we don't even have any distinct resistance points at these levels and generally we would be looking at another 10% + profit, which is what any trader would be looking for in an ideal environment.”  -Trading View

In reality Always trade against BTC unless you are immediately cashing back to fiat after. It’s like a yo-yo with the USD and  BTC valuations. It’s really easy to lose BTC if you are trading it. Plus it’s time consuming and irritating. It sucks loosing Bitcoin and also sucks when you coulda made 10x gains on a coin you were looking at but didn’t buy or sold way too soon ��

Eventually you will fuck up a trade and those BTC gains will vanish into thin air. Don’t get cocky because the market is brutal to hotshots who trade in arrogance.

The loans for the car. I had it completely wrong. Yeah I do the same thing. I bought a one bitcoin in 2017 at $3,500 then sold 0.5 at 8k  then sold 0.25 at 16k and held onto the remaining 0.25 and dabbled in the alts.

Looking at a one month chart ��
Check the 6month and reassure yourself

Why are you taking loans out for crypto??? 
Bout to get rekd if it dumps on you.  Don’t play with what you don’t have to loose...
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:54:24
It’s because of the trading pairs. 
Eliminate BTC trading pairs and you get a true value for all of the particular coins.

Sound money is also stable and doesn’t have thousand dollar price swings.
