I don’t use it but I have heard good things about bread. My impression is that from least to most secure is web wallet on pc&lt;exchange &lt; secure phone wallet&lt;cold storage. Most would advocate only keeping the amount of bitcoin on a hot phone wallet that you would cash in your wallet and the rest in cold storage.

Ummm actually they have been audited. You can go to the tether website and read the independent audit that was done 2016. I’m not saying that it’s honest but it was done by a third-party. So saying that they haven’t been audited is not true

Or use a hardware wallet..... even better

It’s hard to believe that there are so few upvotes and so few comments on such an important post. Thank you for taking the time to post this. It has increased my understanding of this very important topic.
All of us can do our part first by making sure that any transaction you send utilizes segwit.  How do you do this? Make sure that the wallet that you are using is able to send segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:48:02
Are you asking whether using a VPN will increase the anonymity of your transaction? If so then no. Due to KYC ( know your customer )laws the exchange knows who you are and using a VPN won’t change that. If you were asking whether you can use a VPN on an exchange then the answer is certainly yes

If you deliberately avoid paying taxes it is you who will be picking up the soap

Lol I bought your coins. Thanks.

Absolutely nothing. In the short term if you utilize the strategy you will probably not get caught. However it is an extremely risky move and will probably eventually result in getting caught being prosecuted and paying huge fines if not out right jail time for deliberate tax fraud. 
Of course the answer applies to US residents. I know nothing about The likelihood of getting caught for tax fraud in any other country but in the US it seems fairly high

I was just making a stupid joke. I like them too but I always find it funny when someone with a huge stake in bitcoin predicts an astronomical rise in price. I think they (and we all) are a bit biased. I doubt they will ever be trillionaires but if they do make it then I’ll be a millionaire and toast our success
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:52:14
And keep in mind that if you want to support the future of bitcoin use a Wallet that is segwit compatible

You seem to be asking if you can use a VPN and tor to appear to be from a different country than you actually are. If this is true then I suppose so but most exchanges require fairly extensive know your customer verification and I think it would be pretty hard to fake credentials that make you look like you live in Korea if you live in New Jersey.

To hedge a long position?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:59:22
While others here will probably shit all over this answer I don’t think it makes too much difference. The Coinbase vault seems pretty secure to me in that it takes two days and 2 separate email confirmations to get the bit coin out. Make sure you have 2FA authentication enabled on all accounts that link to Coinbase.
Ultimately you are making the right call in taking your bitcoin out of the exchange and onto a hardware wallet. Make sure you do some research about ways to protect your seed
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:11
Ummmm yes there will and it will be violent and painful. Failing to understand this and mentally prepare for it means that you will probably act emotionally to your detriment.

Having been an investor in 2 previous bubbles ( dotcom and real estate) this is absolutely true. Corrections happen especially when everyone has dollar signs in their eyes and already spending all those future profits on a private island and hot and cold running Kristal

Sorry to throw cold water on everyone but it will crash again.....we just don't know when. This will be followed by another rapid price escalation again at an unknown time. 
Please please please don't sell into the next crash. It will happen it always does. I am old enough to have been a dotcom investor in the late 90's and a real estate investor in the aughts. Crashes happen
This difference here is that Joe blow on the streets hasn't even heard of bitcoin yet. Once he does watch out

I was thinking about this question last week. Now that the hedge funds, rich guys, CME and various other whales have shown up btc will not be banned because they won’t allow it

I gave my daughter $20 worth a month ago. I don’t think she thought anything about it at the time. It was just another weird thing dad was into. Last week she checked it and was shocked to see it was now worth $27. 
She has requested that all allowance and gifts be in bitcoin .....smart girl.

Does anyone know if they have the same KYC rules that other exchanges have?
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:27:58
Well not really. The best devs by far in the crypto space are working in bitcoin core. That means something 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:35:03
Shorting is where you bet that a stock or in this case bitcoin is going to go down in value. How it works is that you borrow a certain number of bitcoin from someone. There are people willing to do this because they get a small fee from the person doing the shorting. You then sell the coins. For ease of exclamation let’s say you borrow 10 bitcoins which are currently at $1000. You sell them and net $10,000. Then when the stock goes down you buy them back. In this example let’s say it goes down to $800 and you pay$8000 for the 10 coins. You give the coins back and Now you have earned $2000 minus whatever fee you pay to the person from whom you borrowed the bitcoin.
Unfortunately if the stock goes up at some point you’re going to have to buy it back and you’re going to lose money when you do so. In this example the OP never closed out his short position and therefore owes a lot of money. Fortunately for him this was a demo account and he doesn’t actually owe $50 million
