So learn. 'If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles'. What makes the financial system tick, how much of your money do the banks actually hold on to, and how much is just loaned to other customers. And what types of investment are classed as assets, allowing for higher levels of borrowing from customers? Obviously, this is just a very small look into a small sector as a starting point, the global financial system can't be summed up in a few sentences.

Why? What can they do with an account number? Apply for a direct debit? That's all I can think of. Just tell them to call you if any direct debits get requested.

It depends though, if you're HODLing large amounts of coins, a significant portion of your net worth, and your livelihood depends on them, it can be risky not to hold them on an exchange(s), else you might see some catastrophic event, and have to wait 45 minutes before you can sell (at best).

To be fair, so is the global financial system. Try asking a random person even a basic question about finance, like what derivatives are.
