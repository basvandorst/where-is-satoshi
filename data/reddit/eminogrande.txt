11.979 sat/B. The link is pointing to the transaction. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:46:43
no hurry but thanks for the tip
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:32
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:41:51
Very interesting. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:41:20
When it drop's off, will it just get returned to my sender address?
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:35:38
Going to happen!
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:41:21
signup online that works.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:46:20
great - i'll just wait then
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:55:20
no one?
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:00:35
This is far the best answer - i guess i really missed the last 3 years of wallet innovation. Where would you suggest to create such a wallet?
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:53:42
Very nice article!
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:43:45
Nice, first time I see this...
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:52:08
thank you
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:38:47
yes i did
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:49:22
Would it make sense to pre-configure plug-and-play raspberry pi's and give it to friends and supporters?
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:26:42
Lets do it, it's a 1 hour work and 50$ for a pi, network cable and power plug 
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:43:53
Sounds good, I guess we will find a way, I'll investigate the best way
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:42:11
If amazon just'd take BTC... until than, I happily take the equivalent of 50$ in BTC and set up a node for you ;)
@_date: 2016-01-31 21:56:22
So I can send with 0 fee and if it gets stuck I can change that later to a higher fee? Did I get that right? Can I also reduce fees after sending? I'm also very interested in this. Can my btc with 0 fee can stuck forever because they "never get confirmed"?

@_date: 2017-01-31 19:46:54
Is there any service you would recommend which is the "best cloud service" where i own my wallet? Would it be a way to setup a server (aws for example) and store my wallet there and keeping the password in my head? Or just saving my wallet to google drive or dropbox? Would you say that is more save than having everything in the cloud?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:38:26
Hey, i have read a lot about both currencies. Im much longer into bitcoin though. Etherums office in Berlin is just 200m away, so i got interested in them and read a lot about smart contracts. I also followed the whole DAO thing (and hack) and got my coins out of DAO and put them in an Etherum ETH wallet (not using ETC). I want to support cryptos, thats the main reason why im buying and hodl. I dont know if Etherum can recover though, i hope it for them and their efforts.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:40:13
would you say it bottoms out currenty?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:39:46
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:43:09
i really dont like that stuff gets deleted here on reddit.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:44:55
Thank you everyone - i guess i just hold them.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:56:32
If somebody "steals" my wallet.dat from anywhere, my coins would be still save or am i wrong? He could brutefully try to find my pw but thats all isnt it?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:55:29
Whats confusing with this question?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:48:52
Would it be more save to store my wallet.dat in the cloud?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:42:11
interesting answer.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:41:57
thanks for the honest answer i will hodl
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:41:34
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:43:31
good answer
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:47:17
Would you suggest a cloud backup of my wallet.dat file? Dropbox/Google etc?
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:37:28
Great ������
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:32:26
Is there a "note" explorer for the blockchain? I'd love to see what people have written there so far.
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:41:20
Me too
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:11:58
Very good read indeed 
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:36:02
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:49:22
So UXTO will stay forever? What size is that and is there an service to check these if not I'm building one 
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:40:21
I can tell that it was / is a great get together of very enthusiastic, hard working smart people. I hope there will be more rounds like this. Although it was highly technical, i checked it out because it happened in my neighborhood and it was coincidence that I've met a few participants in a bar before.
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:35:53
thanks, that looks great!
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:10:38
Good idea too
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:50:51
That is beautiful - i guess I'll make a app out of this idea. The good old guestbook is back.
I might even call it "The Blockchain Guestbook" stored forever on all full nodes in the universe :) 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:58:43
This is how they do it
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:12:22
Worst year
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:49:15
Im asking because there are people and companies who want to have a comfortable and transparent way to report their transactions (internally or to local authorities). It’s ok if you don’t - but I guess you still answered my question: the extended pub key is the only way.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:22:41
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:23:22
Didn’t manage to do it with Electrum. Will try again. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:07:32
Thanks got it
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:27:35
Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:37:30
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:00:23
This is a good one.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:58:18
I actually don't know, I'm taking more care of usability 
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:28:23
I was just lazy, i moved most of my funds to a hardware wallet though. Just wanted to warn other users about coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:03:28
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:12:58
Thanks. So what can i do if bread disappears one day? No chance for recovery?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:47:30
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:56:43
Is there a way to double check if the private key I get belongs to my wallet/public key?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:32:15
Looks good, i prefer  currently 
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:32:52
If I only get a private key how do I know the public one which belongs to that key? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:43:52
Thanks. I really think it's the biggest problem in Bitcoin right now when it comes to adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:09:13
So the copay phrase can be used outside copay to recover the private key?
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:34:00
Found myself an answer to this. Sorry 
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:28:05
What is their standard for the pass phrase?
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:37:14
this is a good one thank you.

@_date: 2017-05-18 13:49:36
Not in Germany ���� �� we even have to pay taxes for giving someone a present, especially when it's fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:00:53
Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:16:47
That's bad but good to know thank you �� 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:02:47
Who is BearWhale and what is his story?
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:28:30
Is there any other wallet which offers similar functionality and a recovery seed that I can also use outside the wallet to recover my private key?
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:13:01
Btw: I've got this answer from
Breadwallet support, so I could just run my own bip39 script to recover the pass phrase is that correct?
The breadwallet recovery phrase follows the bip39 standard. We don't have any recommendations for other wallets, but any wallet that accepts bip39 will work. Also, since bip39 is a standard, information on how to convert it to other formats is available on the internet, and there are also tools for advanced users (such as  which make it possible for you to extract your private keys from a bip39 phrase to use with other services. We don't support these advanced operations, so we are not able to give more details.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:35:26
Are your total funds correct? It should show in your coinbase wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:17:22
Maybe you send it to cex exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:24:05
I'm not sure doesn't make sense. Maybe you send it to your own deposit address on coinbase and that's why it shows "you -&gt; coinbase". If that's the case, maybe it's just not yet confirmed this is why it doesn't show up.
Coinbase support takes weeks to answer, but still ask..
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:43:58
So am i right that it would be easy for a millionaire to just buy a few thousand vm's, run the node protocol of his choice and force the bitcoin network to split or use his installed client (core, bu or whatever)?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:08:42
Let's do this!
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:59:37
Agree but also non monetary incentives can be incentives 
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:53:18
So the simple answer is yes, if you "control" more than 50% of the nodes you have quite some power to change things 
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:45:06
Basically the same thing i've asked above. So it's a problem that there are just this few active full nodes and they are basically easy to manipulate? I mean there are already full nodes able to run on an android phone...
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:51:36
Thanks for your answer 
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:56:04
Thank you. Finally a good answer. Yes, i do own a hardware wallet already i just wanted to know if my concerns with software wallets are right (they are).
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:41:18
I like the idea behind that. As long as there enough important nodes the network will work. Maybe I just watched to many end-of-the-world movies and this whole questioning is more or less a thought about:
"What's the worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin"
Nodes seem to be more vulnerable than mining power (even we saw �� antbleed). Long time the 51% attack (especially around 2012/2013) was discussed a lot. It's kind of quite around that topic now and it more looks like "power of user" and "power of nodes". BTW: I like that, i have the feeling it gives a little bit power back from the top 5% rich/poor etc. and also motivates to contribute (with a node for example). Before that, the only incentive where joining the lottery by mining. But there needs to be an incentive for nodes too (doesn't have to be monetary)
Thank you for your answer 
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:49:55
True, I was focusing on bitcoin only. At 1999 I was playing unreal tournament. We had a great community and a lot of fun for a couple of years.
One day they released a new version of the game which was not compatible with the old one (every game studio is like this, they don't do soft forks). What happened that time, was that everyone who could afford a new pc and graphic card started to play the new version.
Many like me stayed at the old one. Our irc channels split. New teams, new leagues pop up, the community split. At the end, both unreal tournament communities didn't had enough players and teams anymore and the whole journey was over. 
I don't want this to happen again to bitcoin. This is one reason why I'm supporting a soft fork. The community is the most important thing
- users
- developers
- nodes
- miner
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:15:23
Where do you have the address from. Is it your coinbase wallet address? Did you login and copy the address from there? If yes, just wait they will appear it takes some time depositing bitcoin to your coinbase account 
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:32:54
Thank you for your answer. Interesting. That's a good point. Haven't thought about that. This is a scale which makes more sense to me too. I'll definitely get some more people to set up a full node at home though.
Maybe a slightly different question (because you mention nat) but could a third party, lets call them "the government" identify nodes by their traffic and block them, or worse, come to your home and take them and yourself away? I'm not paranoid I'm just asking all these questions because I'm really curious. I run a full node by myself and I like to brainstorm scenarios.

Bitcoin improvement proposal and segregated witness (google it)
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:56:27
What did you send. $ or Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:51:35
I could get a thousand nodes and signal sw or bu and split the chain with that or am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:53:02
Maybe just search for a couple of .onion domains which offer a wallet service maybe they are still around like this one:   (havent tested it could be scam too always be careful with googling random wallet providers)
edit: another one:
