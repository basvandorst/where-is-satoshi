Not much, just your regular transaction fees for sending your coins to the new wallet. If in doubt, test with a small amount first. This is now my standard practice for transfers.

If people want to save in crypto. Great! Small-micro investors will legitimise one of the central use cases for it and push the price up for everyone. And, more importantly, the utility.

This is great, thanks. But what's the mechanism for doing nothing = all fine? Can doing nothing = left with worthless alt coins in any scenario?

"If Segwit coins trade at a significantly higher price than legacy coins, the legacy chain has basically no survival chance". 
 Huh? 
How does one know what chain they're part of?

I would also like to know this being in the UK. Options seem really limited. I'm not into localcoins or anything that requires me meeting or trusting other people. To me that's antethical to btc. Bittyliscious seems a total ripoff compared to spot price.

Can you not use a credit card on there?

Yeah, sounds pretty sketchy. Biggest barrier to mass adoption is shit like this imo.

Thanks! I'm interested in learning more. I've actually known about bitcoin since the early years and been invested since the 13 bubble but never understood the developments etc.

Ah, glad I ignored the cold DM from him a few days back offering to buy bitcoin for me!

Thanks for your reply but as a near enough n00b. How can I tell if my software wallet and coins are in one or the other pot?
