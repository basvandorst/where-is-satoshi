Um, very cool.  Thanks for this tip!  Haven't heard of vertcoins before.
Honestly mining is a whole other level to this whole thing.  Not only is it somewhat complicated to buy and hold whatever type of cryptocurrency you want, there is this whole community of people mining them.
I've been reading through these forums and trying to delve into this stuff but it really isn't that easy to pick up!  techy stuff is a hobby for me, I don't have a background in CS or CEng.  Seems like you need that here!

Haha yeah, I'm one of the people that has 0.001!
I gotta say, I'm more technically inclined than most people I know, and I work in technology.  But Bitcoin has a longggggg way before its accessible to average folk, or even about average.

I tried to buy, being Canadian made it a little difficult. Back in September (so we are talking only a few months ago).  I put a few hundred bucks into a website (libertybit) that ended up no longer offering trading abilities.  At the time I only wanted to pay about 100ish for a coin, then I went on a trip and in a blink of an eye it was hitting $1000.  It got out of hand too quickly for me and I was pretty aware of what was going on.  Can't imagine how anyone on the outside would be able to following.

What are the fees of bitcoin cash? Is that trying to fix this issue? Serious question. Not really clear what that split was all about.

So how long you gonna hang on to these.  Is this a very long term outlook?  Congrats on how it has turned out so far!

This means karelb just got $4600+ just like that?  How is that even possible.  You write a message about tipping and bam that guy is 20 bitcoins richer?  Seems like that means this has to be a bubble.  Then again when was it ever that easy to just transfer 1000s to an anonymous stranger just like that.

Can someone help me understand?  It looks like I can get bitcoins at &lt;90 on libertybit while other exchanges are &gt;120?
Is that correct or am I seeing things wrong here?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:32:10
I don't get it.  The prices seem really low &lt;90 in some cases where as everyone else shows &gt;120.  Is that right?  Or is the CAD bitcoin different?  It's a really dumb question I'm sorry.
