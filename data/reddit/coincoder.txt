NEVER EVER SIGN STUFF THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.
If you send him some string and he signs it, it might very well be a valid bitcoin transaction and he just gave you all his money. IF you have to use this method, send him a string and make him sign SHA256(string) or something like that. 
REPEAT: If you sign random stuff with your private key your going to have a bad time

thats why you sign SHA256(something_meaningfull_someone_send_you + my_own_random_sentence). This gives you a cryptographic guarantee instead of "this shouldn't be possible"...

This is actually the right way to do it. Throwing cards around does not give you unbiased randomness.

Its not necessarily impoosible to create a valid bitcoin transaction that look harmless (I'm not quite familiar with the exact binary encoding of bitcoin but since bitcoin messages at least contain a section of bytecode there might be a way). People have been doing this for exploits since a LONG time with x86 opcodes:
However signing something where you are sure that its random garbage is indeed proofable save.
