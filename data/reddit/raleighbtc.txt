Yes as of now the supply side is increasing by 1800 per day and the demand side must absorb a large portion of this.  Another way to think about it... 10-18 million per day is spent in electricity costs.  Some... of those coins are being sold daily/weekly  to pay the energy bills.

There are so many newbies coming in buying bitcoin they don’t know what BCH is.   If CB offered both then I think BCH would have better chance but I just don’t see BCH being able to hold off the thrust of all the new money coming in.  Just my 2 cents I could very well be wrong

I disagree with almost all your points, however I like the fact you took the time to write the article.  
Comparing market share being one of them.  Is this a zero sum market?  If  the S&amp;P 500 expanded to S&amp;P 1,000 would you say OMG Apple just lost huge market share?  
As far as monopoly, I disagree again and believe it’s simple supply and demand?  No one has to buy Bitmain, they can buy Canaan or others.  
Also what is the longest running goverment currency?  Of any country in history of the world ?

It’s not illegal to receive payment or salary in another form?  You can get paid in food, cars, baseball cards.  The gov wants you to pay taxes on value received.  If your gross paycheck is $5,000 and net is $3,500 ... take that $3,500 in any form r fashion you wish.
