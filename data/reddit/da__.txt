The miners don't give a fuck about the dollar price. It's way inflated anyway, I'd personally rather see something like $400-500 at this point in time.
It's the fucking day traders that are ruining Bitcoin. *They* are the ones fucking up the price.
So what if ghash gets 51%? If the miners start seeing reversals, they'll switch. They don't want ghash stealing their coin, and ghash don't want to piss off the miners, as without them they're going home with empty hands.
It doesn't make sense to choose a smaller pool. In 2014, if you're thinking of switching pools, your only sane option is p2p.
