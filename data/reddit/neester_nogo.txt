Science and falsification are incredibly important - not just with Bitcoin, but in every arena. 
The problem for Emin Gun Sirer doesn't lie with his "scientific" approach. Rather, it lies with the fact that when his theories are falsified, he panics, lashes out, pouts, and runs away.
That's not science.
Remember, this is the guy who predicted Bitcoin would fail, several times, and has never acknowledged his mistakes.
Another example: his purported "deal" with Intel. That was just nonsense. Peter Todd (who is about as scientific as it gets), was quick to expose the fraud (in a very scientific way). Emir degenerated into a spoiled brat.

I'm just going to throw this out there. It's a little security quiz. Say I'm a bad guy (which I'm not), and I'm illegally accessing other poeples' computers, looking for Bitcoin (which I'm not). What file do you think I'd be scanning for?

A PoW change is already being organized because (like it or not) there is a 51% attack being mounted against Bitcoin. Again, you can deny it if you like, but that doesn't change the fact that this is real.
I'm not "winding back" the truth. If Roger Ver and Jihan Wu want to come after Bitcoin, let them ponder a scenario in which their ASICs are turned into bricks, overnight. It's a fair, reasonable, and intelligent response to their aggression.

Well first, you're using the word "censor" incorrectly, which tells me you're struggling with a low IQ. So I suppose I have a little sympathy for you.
Just kidding. I don't have any sympathy for you. 
Next: instead of "censoring" you, how about I just give you my new standard reply:
Spam all you want. If Jihan Wu and Roger Ver follow through with their 51% attack on Bitcoin, Bitcoin will appropriately respond by bricking their ASICs. At that point, the (exorbitant, I'm sure) paycheck you've been receiving from them for sending this sort of propaganda will presumably cease to continue.

I have been asking Dash people for months to answer these questions, but other than some pretty serious anger and rudeness, I  haven't been able to get anything substantive.
I would love for any Dash experts to chime in on these points:
1. As the Dash price increases, and old masternode holders cash out, how can new money afford the 1000 Dash stake for a masternode? It seems to me, at some point, the only people who can afford it are the very rich (companies?), pools, or governments. It also seems to me that a necessarily smaller set of masternode owners is -- by definition -- centralization. Not good.
2. Assuming that is correct, what prevents law enforcement agencies from becoming the majority owners of masternodes? At that point, they would have the equivalent power of Tor exit nodes -- i.e., any traffic that runs through a masternode would be "decloaked." If this is incorrect, I would like to know what and how.
3. What on earth prevents TumbleBit, MimbleWimble, and/or Monero -- which are all far better privacy solutions -- from destroying Dash's viability? Dash mixing is already extremely time-consuming and sketchy. How can Dash possibly hope to compete with these other solutions?
4. Why would I use Dash, instead of fiat, if Dash transactions are subject to AML/KYC rules? Recent partnerships make it clear Dash has formed such partnerships.
5. Even if I buy into the whole masternode / PoS model (which I don't, and won't, until someone gives me some viable answers to these questions), Dash punishes masternode holders by kicking them to the back of the weekly reward queue if the server goes offline. In other words, if my masternode has been running diligently for 6.5 days, and it goes down, I have to wait another week for the reward. I know this is true, because I ran almost 25 masternodes at one point, and part of the reason I cashed out was this very issue. I asked for help and got snarled at by a community that insisted I was a Monero shill. That didn't really help change my mind about my participation.
Looking forward to any clear, civil answers and conversation.

Can you imagine the pressure Roger is under right now? He has no one but himself to blame for putting his ego in front of all this bad business, but I still can only guess what it's like for him to put his head on his pillow every night. 
I mean, you can't just tell this many lies, to this many people, and sleep well at night. And this condition is only compounded by the fact that he has wagered his ego against his entire net worth. If he fails (and it sure looks like he will), he's probably going to lose most of his wealth. At the end of it, he will have burned so many bridges, and destroyed so much trust that I can't imagine how many friends (if any) he'll have left. 
The way Roger talked about Charlie Shrem the other day knocked me backward. These guys were good friends up to a couple of weeks ago, it would seem. Roger took a baseball bat to that relationship. If Charlie forgives Roger, he's a bigger person than I would be.

Well, here we go then. Anyone who supports this but opposes Bitcoin Unlimited is a hypocrite. Because this would almost certainly be a minority hard fork.

Good point.
So what do you say, Roger?
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:36:40
I've heard that too, but it's smoke and mirrors. You're still aggregating control into fewer hands. In the end, if I were a state actor, that's exactly the sort of thing I'd do in order to deflect attention from my objectives - with the added bonus of using other peoples' money.
I've heard it all before. Dash is a lot of hype, and very little promise, once you look under the hood. That's why I got out. And while it hurts (and yes it does!) to see all this appreciation since my exit, I'm pretty confident I did the right thing.
One big red flag I keep hearing: "Dash is intends to be the digital currency of the future." This is not only problematic for all the reasons I've already listed, but also because Dash is going to face much more network congestion than Bitcoin, if the Dash price continues to rise. They are not immune to the problems facing Bitcoin, and the PoS and Coinjoin bloat is only going to exacerbate the problem.
Thanks for the response.

I don't know one Core dev or supporter who believes SegWit is "enough." We all believe we need a hard fork at some point. The difference between us and Bitcoin Unlimited people (at least in this regard) is that we believe such a hard fork should be done safely and conservatively.
Bitcoin Unlimited adherents, universally it would seem (although I could be wrong about that) want a hard fork NOW. They don't seem to care about testing or consequences. You can argue with that, I suppose, except there have been three catastrophic failures on the Bitcoin Unlimited network in less than two months - directly attributable to poor coding and testing.
So doesn't this bolster the position we have taken: SegWit now, for a temporary solution. Hard fork later, after testing and peer review?
SegWit gets us 3-4MB of block size, and gets us cheaper/faster transactions. It gets us closer than ever to the hard fork we all want and need.
Wouldn't Jihan Wu and Roger Ver be better served to support this route - after which they would be rich(er) heroes? Why would they want to continue demanding an immediate hard fork that the vast majority of the Bitcoin community (economic and otherwise) opposes (for now, in light of safety and security)?
Why be broke villains when we can all be rich heroes?
If I haven't answered your question (although I think I probably have): yes, I think most BU supporters are in favour of a hard fork, and deep centralization. But I also believe that Adrian X typifies most BU supporters, in that he has become entrenched in a mania without really understanding the technology behind Bitcoin. It's a huge problem we're facing at this point, although it is diminishing as people become more and more educated about the ridiculous and completely fallacious "Blockstream-is-Core" and "Core-is-censorship!" propaganda that his been pumped out like free seawater for the last few months.
Once that propaganda becomes apparent for what it is, most Bitcoin Unlimited proponents jump ship. Some, unfortunately, entrench further. But they will get what they deserve for that.
Ultimately, Roger Ver is a liar. l don't say that with any malice. He has been caught so many times that it even his most ardent supporters are questioning his motives (even you, probably). I think most of them are starting to have serious doubts. I think most of them are starting to realize there is no real "Bitcoin Core." There is just Bitcoin. And Bitcoin Unlimited has declared war against it. Roger and Jihan will do and say anything to keep momentum, but they are running out of cash. Spamming the network is no longer working. And people are really reacting adversely to Roger's lies, backtracking, excuses, and false accusations.
Bitcoin, by design, guarantees this is a war that can't be won. It takes time, but I'm pretty sure Bitcoin always wins.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:15:57
Bitcoin Unlimited is bad:
- Software has had three catastraphic failures in less than two months.
- Roger Ver and Jihan Wu are planning a malicious 51% attack against Bitcoin.
- Roger Ver has been caught lying many times.
- Bitcoin Unlimited seeks to impose a president, secretary, and board on the community (centralized).
- Bitcoin Unlimited gives majority power to miners, centralizing the network and introducing the danger of price manipulation.
SigWit is already here and solves all the problems Bitcoin Unlimited purports to want fixed.
There is no good reason for Bitcoin Unlimited to succeed. The market recognizes that. Thus, all the propaganda and lobbying are failing. Roger and Jihan are desperate, because they are going to take a huge loss. But that is a direct result of their poor judgment.
I think that covers it. The incomprehensible ignorance displayed (twice) by Adrian today really exemplifies the attitude, mindset, and total misguided state of Bitcoin Unlimited. Everyone needed to see this.

There are people who want to be honest. They want to be good. They want to do the right thing. 
In business, these types of people will make short-term sacrifices in order to nurture long-term relationships. For people like this, community and family are not only more important than profit and prosperity, they are essential to profit and prosperity.
These people view their morality as their most precious asset. They understand and treasure their reputations. These people will make huge sacrifices in order to avoid lying to, or stealing from anyone else. They support their friends when their friends are hurt or have suffered loss.
People like this do not make decisions based on whim. They certainly don't make decisions leading to short-term gain, if those gains are going to hurt others.
More than anything else, you can find a steel-like sense of consistency in people like this. No matter how good or bad the current environment is, people like this will make decisions that you can depend on - that you can rely on with an atomic accuracy. They pride themselves on this consistency, and it drives their deep sense of moral and ethical fortitude.
Now here's what many of you fail to understand. Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Vitalik Buterin, and so many of the other actors in this game are not these types of people. They will always act in favour of their own self-absorbed interests - regardless of the consequences.
People like Erik and Roger easily understand what they are doing. But they justify the pain they cause their friends, community, and family by manufacturing convenient stories of wrong-doing, and even criminality.
If the tide swings, people like Erik and Roger will shift their narrative to reflect changing conditions; they will alter their course to further maximize their personal gain. And if their hypocrisy and prevarication is exposed, they simply deflect the accusations, adding them to the lists of manufactured malfeasance that justifies their behaviour.
History is rife with these types of people - from Stalin, to Hitler, to J. Edgar Hoover, to Pol Pot. I'm sure anyone here could compound this list quickly and easily, because we all recognize who they have been. They are politicians. They are dictators. They are manipulative, cruel, and evil. They are driven by their egos, and they live by only one, consistent philosophy: the end justifies the means.
This is who Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver, and all of their comrades are.

He's never going to honour his agreement to exchange Bitcoins (Gold 2.0) for BUTs (PayPal 2.0). He's stupid. But he's not that stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:40:12
That's funny. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu have thrown millions at an "orchestrated attack" of Bitcoin Core -- attempting to create an OPEC-style oligopoly. Roger even recently said to Bloomberg that he is "lobbying" in China. It doesn't get more "orchestrated" than that.
Bitcoin Core, of course, did not mount an attack on Bitcoin Unlimited. And yet, despite all of BU's lies, politicking, manipulation, and "lobbying," its proponents are blaming their own incompetence and failure on an attack by Core.
They sound like Maduro and his thugs -- blaming everyone else in the world for Venezuela's woes, when in fact the economy has collapsed directly because of Chavista socialism. And just as Chavez and Maduro were warned for years of the consequences of their folly, Roger Ver, Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jihan Wu (among so many others) were warned - ad infinitum - of the problems Bitcoin Unlimited would suffer.
If this is the end - and I sincerely hope it is - I hope we never hear from them again. I especially mean that about Roger Ver. I once had so much respect for him, but he has shown himself to be the worst outcome of a spoiled brat, mixed with too much money.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:18:16
Well, first, Roger has to get 40% MORE hash rate, the majority of nodes, and the majority of users before he can even think about a successful takeover. And that's not going to happen. So the odds are firmly at zero.
But set all that aside. This "genius," Roger Ver, who apparently knows all the odds and knows everything else because he's just-so-fucking-smart-and-shit already said, publicly, that he believes the exchange would be fair. So it's not a "bet" at all; we're asking Roger to make good on his agreement to exchange BU coins for Bitcoins.

This is a pointless endeavor. I'll bet a solid Bitcoin that Roger won't even respond to this. He's bluffing, and knows there won't be a hard fork. He also knows that Bitcoin Unlimited is full of holes and bugs. Roger knows, with absolute certainty, that if he dumps Core coins for BU coins, his fortune will be gone. He's stupid, but he's not that stupid.
Did I mention he's an immoral liar, too? I wouldn't make a deal with him unless it is firmly rooted in a trusted third party. Roger will renege faster than than the lightning network can accommodate 1000 transactions.

He has a chance in this moment to go down in history as a hero and a billionaire. I don't see why he wouldn't take that opportunity by getting behind SegWit. Same goes for Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:38:24

I'm really proud of Charlie for stepping up and saying the things he said today. But we all need to be aware of the fact that this is the 51% attack Satoshi Nakamoto warned us of.

This is an appropriate and necessary response to protect Bitcoin from aggressors who have explicitly said that they are fine with Bitcoin becoming PayPal 2.0.

If ~85% of the network is running Core software, miners ignoring consensus rules will have their blocks rejected. Don't believe me? I guess we'll see.

Why will it be harder to split them?
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:02:51
Do you know how many times BCash idiots said the. Exact. Same. Thing? They were wrong.
So now you're saying that miners are going leave Bitcoin for S2X? That's absurd. Certainly not 95% of them. But even if they do, and ~85% of the network is still running core, those miners' blocks will be rejected. It's happened before. It will happen again.
So, you see, you don't really understand how this all works. And you're making tired claims we've all heard 1000 times before, and have always proved false.
Here's my advice. Put all your money in BCash and S2x. Check back with us in two years. Let us know how "rich" you are at that point.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:12:22
This is incorrect. Nodes have to upgrade to s2x software in order for their blocks to be validated. There's no way that s2x software is going to replace the ~85% of nodes currently running Core. s2x is DOA.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:06:25
Right. If 99% of the world downloaded and installed Linux on their Windows machines, the world would be Linux-based. But that isn't going to happen. Likewise, faeries and unicorns aren't going to start running the World Health Organization tomorrow. Just so you know.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:13:28
s2x will be yet another alt. There's no way around that now.

If Core had a monopoly, they would activate SegWit. That's how monopolies work. Your response doesn't come close to addressing the question, but thank you for it anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:40:05
What you're actually asking for is "evidence," not "facts." Falsifiable theories require a preponderance of evidence; "facts" are the tools of absolutists, not science-minded truth-seekers.
I offered the opening quote by Goebbels (as evidence) to illustrate his strategy: to repeat lies, with the objective of making them seem like truth. This is a strategy that Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright have all used, effectively. As further evidence, I offer the Tweets, web-site announcements, press releases, and Reddit posts of any and all of these characters. They exists in abundance, and are easily referenced by almost anyone.
We have all seen the outpouring of propaganda from all three of these Bitcoin-related actors. I am assuming that the audience is, for the most part, not comprised of cave-dwellers, and is aware of the campaigns - which, again, exist in abundance.
Your accusation that I have not "[laid] out any facts..." is a common and trite form of diversion. The burden of proof would certainly be on me if the internet itself didn't offer a plethora of easily identifiable support.
Let me put it another way: this forum alone is rife with the multitudinous propagandistic claims of Roger Ver, Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. If you feel that I am obligated to re-state them, then you are wrong. And you are going to be disappointed (because I'm not going to do that).
The audience is what matters here. I believe that most, if not all, of them have seen the tactics to which I refer. I believe, further, that they will see your petty demand for "facts" as the distraction it is.
Thanks for the response. I hope that helps.

You are correct. I am comparing the tactics used by Roger Ver, Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu to Josoph Goebbels - the Nazi propagandist. The entire piece is based on the clear similarities in their methodologies.

It's never okay to be an apologist, but this is completely indefensible. Emin uses his position at Cornell to act as an authority of merit, when he has proven time and again he is not.

But SegWit has not activated, which means Core doesn't have a monopoly. There's no dancing around that.

Right. That is a good point. But I do think a change in block rewards would be pretty obvious. I think Jihan Wu is in a tough place.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:54:56
Yep. But we should be clear: I don't think Roger Ver is talented or bright enough to use these media tactics on his own. He has employed very skilled professionals who manage this campaign for him.
Roger's biggest problem (although he doesn't yet realize it) is that his absolute inability to feel guilt or empathy is costing all his credibility. Normal people can't fathom maintaining a lie after being so blatantly exposed. We may backpedal, or retreat, but we don't attack. But Roger just keeps plowing forward. It feels good to him now, but he hasn't even considered the damage it is doing to his fragile ego. When a power-hungry "star" fails, it is more devastating than most of us can imagine. Roger has no idea what's coming. He believes his proverbial "15 minutes" is permanent. And while I could be wrong, I don't believe I am.
Roger is a true sociopath. He understands that the most effective tool a liar has is the ability to repeat the lie. And the fact that he has no compunction about it makes it much more powerful. It's fascinating and terrifying at the same time. Lying just doesn't bother Roger Ver. There's always a way out. Until there's not.
Perhaps the most troubling part of it, however, is the army of loyal who do not understand how much they have been manipulated. Even after the lies have been so glaringly revealed, the vulnerable redouble their defense. Certainly part of this results from mental under-capacity. But it also derives so much from emotional and psychological vulnerability. I was surprised to see how many people in the Bitcoin community were prone to this disease, simply because it seems so obvious to the rest of us.
At the Nuremberg trials, even as they were sentenced to death, many Nazis were shocked and outraged at their sentences. They truly believed their movement was "correct" - that their actions were morally and ethically defensible. They went to the gallows believing they were "right."
It's weird to see this disease pervade Bitcoin. But we are lucky Bitcoin was designed to resist it. It's gratifying to see Bitcoin Unlimited falter after every wave - despite the resources and proponents. 
Bitcoin is doing what it was designed to do. The status quo is taking the day.
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:03:22
Nah. You're just looking for any reason not to acknowledge what's really happening. You're trying to obfuscate the clarity and simplicity of what this is.
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:19:27
Sure. All the attempts he's made at calling the AsicBoost issue a "lie." 
He really, really cares. And you care too. We all care. That's why this is such a big issue. Bitcoin Unlimited is dying. SegWit is closer than ever to activation.
Yep. We all care.
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:57:44
Under almost any circumstances, I would agree with Greg here. But the problem is that Jihan Wu and Roger Ver have openly mounted a malicious 51% attack against Bitcoin. If Bitcoin doesn't defend itself, they will simply buy more ASICs and increase the potency of this 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:16:30
Emin goes on to say, "...it's fundamentally broken at the protocol level."
So I guess Cornell has lowered it's standards a bit in recent years? 
Also participating in the conversation, Zooko, founder of ZCash.
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:06:50
But the advantage would be visible in Bitcmain's success. If they remove AsicBoost functionality, their success decreases. I understand what you're saying, but I disagree. If they're using AsicBoost to gain a revenue advantage, then that advantage would be evident with discontinued use.
Yes, the power savings is the way the advantage works, but the only reason to use it is to generate more revenue (and higher profit margins) than unwitting competitors. And that would be evident in the rewards.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:49:14
There is a wonderful truism that has lasted through the ages: the best government is one that is in constant gridlock, and can get nothing done. 
We don't need to resolve this stalemate. Bitcoin is fine. It is working just as it is supposed to. Bitcoin Unlimited will lose steam and fade away. Then SegWit will get activated. And we will go from there.
Bitcoin's biggest annoyance at this point comes from people who need to "fix" it. And I say "annoyance" because that's all they are. Bitcoin doesn't care what you think. Bitcoin isn't going to change to suit your business model. Bitcoin doesn't need any "governance" or "transaction supplementation" or "guidance."
Bitcoin needs to be left alone. Of course, everyone thinks he has the best "solution" for Bitcoin. So the flies will keep buzzing. Bitcoin will yawn, check the time, and continue to do what it does best - in spite of all the "smart people."
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:43:03
He said the protocol was dead. How are you guys not seeing that part? Please pay attention.
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:08:38
And change to profitability IS the metric that would cause the problem - especially if it was correlated to the discovery of AsicBoost.
I wouldn't want to be Jihan Wu right now. If he is/was covertly using AsicBoost, and he gets firmly exposed, he's fucked.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:44:40
This isn't about market-timing. Okay, yes, it was bad timing. But still, this is about the fact that this "pundit" declared the Bitcoin protocol completely broken. He couldn't have been more wrong about that.
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:53:29
This is a common and extremely weak emotional appeal. Yes, I disagree with Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright. I think most of what they say is based on very carefully crafted lies. It shouldn't be astonishing to you at all that someone would point out how similar their strategies are to those used by Joseph Goebbels. I'm sorry you're astonished, but I believe your reaction is completely misplaced.
People shouldn't lie. People shouldn't make lying a campaign. People certainly shouldn't usurp the minds of those less fortunate and more vulnerable in order to advance their lies.
Thanks for the response.

I'm not throwing around the term "monopoly." I am responding directly to the fallacious claims by Bitcoin Unlimited proponents that Core has a monopoly.
And I am pointing out that, if Core does indeed have a monopoly, then it should (and would) activate SegWit immediately.
It sounds like you and I agree that Core does not have a monopoly, however - which makes the Bitcoin Unlimited claims egregiously incorrect (and immoral).
Thanks for the discussion.

@_date: 2017-04-08 14:09:59
But that leaves them in the dubious position of losing the advantage when UASF / SegWit are activated. Then it will become obvious, and it will be clear that he lied (assuming he used AsicBoost covertly).

@_date: 2017-04-14 05:10:49
This response is poorly worded, and maybe that's why I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say. I can respond to parts of it, however.
Goebbels was the originator of the style of propaganda that drove wicked disinformation machines for most of the 20th century - including Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao, and so many others. The style continues today - most recently employed by Nicolas Maduro.
As such, Goebbels was arguably the most powerful man of the 20th century, and his evil continues to affect our world. It's horrific that Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright (among others in this ecosystem) have resorted to maintaining so many demonstrable lies. But if one use the right mechanisms, one can easily influence the stupid - especially if one lacks the compunction and moral impediments to question his own motives and methods. Without guilt and empathy, these people become fast-moving steam rollers.
That's what sociopaths do.
As for the rest of us, we have to decide (if we are mentally capable) to recognize and rebut these methods. Or (for those mentally incapable), perhaps it just means getting sucked in and pumped up - parroting the words of the wicked men behind these wicked campaigns.
Bitcoin is important. And in that regard, you are correct: I know which side I'm on. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:30:30
Yep. That's definitely worth a hunert-twenty mil.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:38:21
According to Occam's Razor, the correct answer is: 
Bitcoin Core does not have a monopoly. Not even close.
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:40:50
Also, I just want to make a quick correction. I think you meant to call it BCASH. There is only one Bitcoin. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto at the same time he started the Core repository. Bitcoin is maintained by Core. It is advanced by Core. The world knows Bitcoin. The world accepts Bitcoin. The world wants Bitcoin.
BCASH is an alt, competing against tens of thousands of established alts. BCASH has no unique value proposition. BCASH has not enjoyed any adoption to speak of. Most of the world has never heard of BCASH. BCASH's price ratio with Bitcoin has suffered, as has its USD price.
BCASH was started by - and has depended on - the resources of people like Jihan Wu and Roger Ver. But those resources cannot last forever. And when they dry up, BCASH will not have the momentum it needs to take on an antifragile, brilliant creation like the Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the original. It has survived every test. It was designed to get stronger with attacks from groups like BCASH and 2X. Bitcoin is performing as planned (as you pointed out).
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:11:01
Mayhem neither works in Coinbase's nor 2X's favour. It would be the worst move they could make. Coinbase is already struggling to serve its user base. A move like that might very well destroy the company.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:26:09
A 2MB increase in block size isn't going to save BitPay - even with SegWit. That's what makes their stance so much more abhorrent. But as I've said before, it's moot. 2X is DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:39:17
That it's called BCASH. There's only one Bitcoin - created, maintained, and advanced by Core.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:41:57
This is a dangerous game of chicken that Coinbase can't afford to play. They will support the legacy Bitcoin chain. If they don't, and the fork fails, Coinbase is going to suffer dramatically.
I don't think anyone is that stupid.
Well, Bitpay might be that stupid. And Erik Voorhees (u/evoorhees) might be that stupid. But I don't think Coinbase is.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:07:34
Because 2X doesn't have more economic backing. It's that simple.
Coinbase and Bitpay are mere drops in the bucket compared to every exchange, every wallet provider, every processor, every retailer, all over the world, from Brazil, to Australia, to Japan, to Hong Kong, to India, to...
2X has no chance to gain enough network share to validate their blocks. It's already over.
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:09:42
How many users do you think are going to be running the NYA software? How likely do you think it is that people will take the time to uninstall Core and install NYA? That's just silly.
Let me put it another way: how many companies and businesses are still running Windows 7? It's hard to convince the world to "upgrade" - especially when the "upgrade" is dangerous and contentious.
2X is DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:48:41
I received this from u/2dsxc:
 














 
So you started your response by calling me a "retard." Can I ask you a couple of questions?
1. Do you really think I am retarded?
2. When the entire world knows BCASH as "BCASH," do you believe it is accurate to say that using it "undermines my intellect"?
By the way, I believe you contradicted yourself: you called me a "retard," but then acknowledged that I have an "intellect" to "undermine." I just feel like I should point out that inconsistency.
Anyway, sorry to digress. I also want to point out that you are using the world "censorship" incorrectly. Censorship occurs when a regime uses force to prevent people from publishing and/or communicating within its borders. China "censors." North Korea "censors."
What does NOT constitute "censorship" is using the Internet freely. In that case, while your comments might be moderated in one forum or context, you can freely post those thoughts in another forum or context. It's hardly rational, for instance, for Roger Ver to claim he is being censored, when he owns a site like Bitcoin.com, which luxuriates in thousands of views and users.
Clearly, Roger Ver has many outlets where he can express his opinion. As such, his claims of "consorship" are not only incorrect, they're downright silly. In fact, I would say his abuse of the word "censorship" has backfired on him - causing him to be perceived more as a brat than a serious voice in this debate.
Finally, I'll attempt to reinforce the advice a gave you earlier: referring to people you disagree with as "dense cunts" doesn't make your support of BCASH stronger. In fact, I would suggest that it perpetuates the general mood that seems to pervade today - that BCASH is a project run by angry, immature people who fall back on profanity and insults because they simply don't understand the technology that makes Bitcoin anti-fragile.
Bitcoin was designed to get stronger with attacks from groups like BCASH and 2X. Hurling expletives doesn't weaken its plight or its dominance - and, in fact, probably has the opposite effect. If you really think about it, I believe you'll eventually agree. Certainly many of your BCASH brethren, who don't have a dog in this particular fight, are wincing at the puerility you've displayed.
BCASH was started by Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and people like them. It depends on their resources, and when those resources are gone, BCASH won't have much momentum left. It suffers from lack of adoption.
BCASH's speed and low transaction costs haven't materialized. BCASH transasctions, are, in fact, slower and more expensive than SegWit transactions (which is also working as planned).
Perhaps the biggest blow to the aforementioned BCASH promises is the exceessive abuse (and failure) of the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) - which has failed to deliver for any meaningful amount of time.
BCASH has taught the world a lot about Bitcoin. In fact, the attempted confusion by BCASH proponents by using the word "Bitcoin" as a descriptor has been a boon to the one true Bitcoin (started, maintained, and advanced by Core). I would argue that each time a BCASH supporter erroneously uses the term "Bitcoin Cash," he is sending any audience he enjoys directly into the open arms of a well-recognized, well-adopted, and superior technology in the one, true Bitcoin.
Anyway, thanks for the discussion, and I wish you the best of luck with you debate strategies. I think you'd have far more success if you polished them up a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:16:42
Okay... "mate." Well that's what Roger Ver and Jihan Wu used to say. But they sure were wrong.
I guess we'll just have to see.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:36:44
If the signers of the NYA try to list 2X as "Bitcoin," and they fail to achieve an economic majority (which most of us think is the likely outcome), the patrons of these companies will be confused, and most likely furious. It will be an absolute disaster for companies like Coinbase and Bitpay.
If 2X takes the safer route (which is most likely at this point), they will be a true alt. They will be no different than BCASH - with the exception of SegWit.
You seem to be suggesting, however, that you believe 2X will get an economic majority. I disagree. Here are my thoughts:
Coinbase, Bitpay, et al are not stupid. They will not risk losing huge market share (or even risk complete failure) by trying to usurp the name "Bitcoin" without a clear economic majority (consensus). They do not currently have consensus, nor is there any reason to believe they will achieve consensus. 
While it is true that Coinbase represents millions of users, it's questionable how many of those users are "active." It is also very questionable as to whether or not Coinbase and Bitpay have enough economic support to overwhelm the vast number of other wallet-providers, exchanges, users, remittance services, and retailers around the entire world - including S. Korea, Europe, Australia, Russia, Japan, the United States, Latin America, and even China.
If Coinbase, BitPay, et al are able to gain a clear economic majority, and manage to take the "Bitcoin" name away from Core and its supporters, then the Bitcoin experiment will truly be dead in all ways except in name. It will be a very, very slow version of PayPal, and it will have none of the brain-power that brought it to where it is now. It will be vulnerable to any changes these CEOs and companies deem expedient (or are pressured to deem expedient). 
I want no part of something like that, and I think I speak for a lot of very, very smart people when I say that. No matter the outcome, 2X has a bleak future. 
1. 2X can be a true alt, and thus compete with all existing alts (including BCASH). 
2. It can make a horrible miscalculation and attempt to claim an economic majority it doesn't have. If that happens, the companies supporting it will be crippled - at least for a time.
3. It can win, in which case, it becomes an inefficient and inferior competitor to PayPal.
Either way, 2X is going to have a bleak future. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:03:58
You may want to research this a bit more. If 2X is banking on this in order to take over the Bitcoin network, there is going to be a whole lot of 2X butthurt.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:30:21
There is nothing preventing these companies and CEOs from TRYING right now. And that's exactly what they're doing: testing the limits. If 2X were to succeed, subsequent changes would be much easier for the companies to push through.
But when 2X fails, it's unlikely anyone will try this again - except, perhaps, state actors. But even they are starting to see the limited influence they have over Bitcoin. That, however, is a story for a different thread.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:41:48
The companies behind the 2X hard fork and the NYA have three possible paths:
1. Continue to support a failed 2X and suffer horribly, scrambling in the aftermath.
2. Continue to support a successful 2X and suffer as the new centralized "Bitcoin" simply fails as a slower, less efficient version of PayPal.
3. Abandon 2X and ride Bitcoin to the stars.

He seems to represent a large contingency of the BCASH movement. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:05:35
Was I delusional when I said BCash wouldn't take over the Bitcoin network - despite the fact that Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and countless of their minions insisted that BCash would immediately overtake and destroy Bitcoin?
It was all bluster, and Bitcoin didn't even stumble. But BCash HAS struggled, and is failing. 
You can call it "divisive" if you like, but there are malicious actors trying to steal the Bitcoin network. It's helpful to point out the futility of their efforts. It's also helpful to point out how much they have to lose by attacking something that was designed specifically to grow stronger from their attacks.
Bitcoin is working as planned. I'm just the messenger.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:49:18
And to make them economically viable? I think they should go for it. Let's see what happens. This is game theory at its best. Jihan and Roger, and all their minions lost. Let's see if Coinbase and Bitpay want to try their hand - and risk everything.
Even f they do spin up a few thousand AWS instances, and manage to get them economically viable, and deal with any and all associated potential issues, there's still absolutely no guarantee they will have more economic nodes than Core (more than 90% of the network is currently running Core software). In fact, most of us believe they will not.
Coinbase and Bitpay, as I've said so many times, are taking a huge gamble if they go this route. If they should fail, it will almost certainly destroy their businesses.
When you couple this part of the gamble with all the replay issues, potential lawsuits, customer support problems... and then you look at the possibility that all of this could go VERY wrong for Coinbase and Bitpay (et al), you start to wonder if they really have the balls to play this level of game theory to its conclusion.
Add to that the fact that they lose the 100 best devs in the entire crypto space - the devs who know Bitcoin better than anyone (including the broken BIZCOIN software, which is 98% Core's creation)... yeah... this isn't a very good idea.
Coinbase would be suicidal not to withdraw from BIZCOIN.

Thanks for clarifying.
The problem with your thesis is that miners weren't the driving force behind the NYA, and they won't be the deciding force if (big if) 2X succeeds. If that were to happen, the driving force would be the companies and CEOs that secretly created and agreed to the NYA.
If 2X succeeds, it means that CEOs and the companies they represent can simply change Bitcoin any way they like, at any time they like. There is no other conclusion to draw. 2X has been a difficult trip, but if these CEOs succeed, the next time will be easy. In fact, there probably won't be a "next time"; most of us think that, were 2X to succeed, a mere threat of another secret agreement from CEOs would be enough to affect any change.
Certainly these companies can (and will be) pressured to implement AML/KYC at the protocol level. That's a given. Governments will capitalize on this and coerce the change almost immediately.
The 21 million cap will quickly become a political issue as the "haves" are accosted by the "have nots" and pressured to "do something" about the price of Bitcoin.
But again, this is all hypothetical, and very improbable. 2X has almost no chance of success at this point.
But if it 2X does succeed, you can kiss "Bitcoin" goodbye in all facets but the name. The experiment will move elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:48:22
Also important: many people think that because Coinbase has millions of users, that means it has millions of nodes. It doesn't. It's running its users through relatively few nodes, meaning it doesn't have the strength many 2X people are claiming.
Could Coinbase spin up more nodes and make them economically viable. Sure. But they don't even have the resources to handle their current load. 2X is going to effectively double (or more) their tech burden. I don't think they have the time or resources to spend spinning up nodes that probably won't make the difference anyway.
2X is all bluster. It's DOA. NYA signers like Coinbase and Bitpay are playing a game of chicken they can't win, and the stakes are huge.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:06:30
I have carefully considered this argument in the past (and I am listening to you now). I believe, however, the argument is specious. I don't think the "10 million users" Coinbase serves do carry as much weight as you think - simply because they aren't all active, at any given time. Indeed, most of them never use those accounts more than once (if at all).
I add to that my interest in all of the wallets, exchanges, services, etc around the world, and my fear of Coinbase and Bitpay diminishes rapidly.
In my mind (and I don't think I'm alone), Coinbase and Bitpay are taking an extreme risk by betting on 2X. If they're right, the best-case scenerio is absolute chaos in Bitcoin. Everyone loses - including Coinbase and Bitpay.
If they're wrong, however, the hard fork is a mere hiccup (ala BCASH). Again, chaos ensues - not for Bitcoin as a whole this time, but ONLY for Coinbase and Bitpay. They either have to scramble all of the resources to support both chains (we've all seen how that goes). Or they have to scramble their resources to convert everyone back to the Core network.
I don't even want to think about the nightmare any of this would cause. My guess is that Bitpay, and especially Coinbase, already know all of this. Maybe they're holding out to see if something will change. But every day, support for 2X wanes. Jeff Garzik is a mediocre dev (putting it nicely). The development process for 2X has stalled. Companies continue to abandon the NYA. The community is furious.
I don't think either Coinbase, Bitpay, or anyone else is willing to take this risk right now. But I guess we'll see...
EDIT: one other thing I didn't point out: just because Coinbase has millions of customers, that doesn't meant they have millions of nodes. This is what I meant when I said I think people overestimate the influence they have.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:46:11


If it's true that Coinbase is able to affect the outcome of this conflict, then Bitcoin doesn't deserve to survive.
Said another way, if 10 or 20 companies have enough economic power to decide the future for all of us, Bitcoin does not deserve to survive.
Bitcoin was not created to be run by a handful of companies and their CEOs. If you are correct in your assertion, then the Bitcoin experiment has truly failed.

Terms of service don't protect companies from fraud, deception, and/or theft.
But people should get their Bitcoins out of companies like Coinbase immediately, and keep them out until this is resolved. **If you have your Bitcoins stored with an online provider YOU DO NOT CONTROL YOUR PRIVATE KEYS.**
Use a wallet you control. I suggest:
1. Bitcoin Core - full blockchain / full node
2. Electrum - SPV
3. Samourai - Android
If you don't know what any of this means, then your Bitcoins are probably at risk. Do your research. It's important.

That isn't a problem. The 90% of hash rate (which is an incorrect number, by the way) will convert almost immediately when their blocks are rejected by the dominant software on the network. You missed that part, I think.
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:06:56
This is all moot. When 2X miners try to validate their blocks with the 90%+ of computers running Core, those blocks will be rejected. At that point, miners will immediately jump back to Core. Jihan Wu knew this, and despite years of threats, he was smart enough to make BCash an alt, rather than trying to steal the Bitcoin network. BCash founders are stupid, but they aren't THAT stupid.
But it's starting to look like Jeff Garzik, Erik Voorhees, et al, ARE that stupid.
The only way to avoid having blocks rejected is 2X becoming an alt like BCash. If that's the case, then none of this matters because it's just another air drop. If they don't provide replay protection, I guarantee that every exchange on earth will avoid them.
If Erik Voorhees -- who has proven that he doesn't understand Bitcoin very well at all (and that should terrify anyone using Shapeshift) -- decides Shapeshift is going to use 2X without replay protection, it will destroy his company. Anyone who uses Shapeshift at that point is an ignorant fool, because that user WILL have money stolen.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:49:43
Not only will it attract more change attempts from these companies and CEOs, but the mere threat of the attempts will likely be enough to affect changes that the community would otherwise disagree to - without any action at all.

I'm saying that signing/signalling has been a false flag every time an "agreement" has been created in Bitcoin. What matters is the outcome. And I am saying that many of the companies that signed the NYA have withdrawn or will withdraw their support once it gets down to the wire.
I'm also saying that the way miner | user | node support is being calculated is frequently incorrect. I don't believe that many of the people involved with this debate really understand what's going to occur if and when the hard fork happens.
This is as much (or more?) game theory as it is tech and statistics. Many people fail to understand completely the risks that companies like Bitpay and Coinbase are assuming if they stay with 2X all the way to the end. If they are incorrect (and many of us are quite confident they are), then the amount they stand to lose is staggering.
But please let's not stop there. Continuing with game theory: we're not just talking about one or two big companies here. We're talking about the intentions, resources, and risks held by every single interested party in this debate. You may feel (as Jihan, Roger, et al did) quite confident in your numbers. You may have a feeling of certainty about the outcome.
I believe such certainty is horribly misplaced. I believe the actors in this play have varying degrees of tolerance for and certitude about the outcome. And I believe, when it gets down to the wire, the risk of being wrong about 2X far outweighs any benefits they might achieve if 2X succeeds.
If I'm right, 2X is already doomed, and the players who ride it the longest stand to feel the most pain. Part of the reason I believe I'm correct is that so many players have already expressed their disapproval, or explicitly removed themselves from the game.
It's a huge, complicated game of chicken. But Bitcoin was designed to favour the incumbents, and that means people like Barry Silbert, Jeff Garzik, Erik Voorhees and the companies like Coinbase and Bitpay have far more to lose than the rest of us.
If 2X wins, those of us who hold won't be affected either way. We'll still be carrying the winning card, right? We just cash out and move on to something better when the time is right.
But if Garzik, Silbert, Voorhees, Bitpay, and Coinbase are wrong, they stand to lose everything (or a significant chunk of "everything").
The worst part of this is that 2X is now unnecessary. We have SegWit. BCASH has hard forked and is proving to be a failure. So why put the entire multi-billion dollar network at risk for no reason? What possible good can come of this reckless behaviour? And to think it was started by a handful of companies who refused to invite the Core developers (who understand all of this far better than anyone...). it's absolutely shameful.
So we'll see.

I'm not talking about a compromise. I'm talking about Core taking control and undermining the irresponsible, politically-motivated movements like BCASH and BIZCOIN.
If Bitcoin Core doesn't think the time is right, then I side with them. They have my faith, and my trust. I am only presenting this as an option, and I have absolutely no illusions that Core devs have not only thought about it, but have a very good reason for not pursuing it.
I love Bitcoin. If my suggesting helps, good. If it doesn't, then I've probably learned what I need to know. But I am certainly, absolutely, positively not asking Bitcoin Core to compromise. I am firmly against compromising with terrorists like Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Barry Silbert, and Jeff Garzik. My suggestion of a hard fork would seek to do exactly the opposite - to steal the terrorists momentum.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:07:57

BIZCOIN is going to fail no matter what Coinbase does. They can never control enough economic nodes to usurp the network.

Before writing two short sentences, you should have considered whether or not I did read u/evoorhees's public comments (instead of assuming I didn't).
And I suggest you may want to re-read my response to him (since you obviously didn't) - in which I specifically pointed out how copious his inconsistencies and contradictions are, in every other context.
One "public statement" won't undo Erik's lies, hypocrisy, arrogance, and ignorance in so many other places. And before you try to play the "people change" card, you should research the volume of his hubris over the last month - in the face of civil, patient tutelage from the most brilliant minds in crypto.
u/evoorhees has an agenda. He will say or do anything to achieve it - his ignorance of the technology notwithstanding. He is an enemy of Bitcoin, and he is an enemy of reason. Nobody cares if he fails anymore. He can be replaced. But the damage his position could do to his users (and even Bitcoin, given the right circumstances) is appalling and shameful.

The problem is - as I outlined in my original post - 2X has no chance of taking over the Bitcoin network. It will not have the software majority it needs to validate its blocks on the Bitcoin network. And if 2X becomes a true alt (which is really the only option), it will compete against BCASH, not Bitcoin. 
2X is a fiasco. If the people behind it continue to hope for success - blind to reality in deference to their swollen egos - they will pay a severe price. But history is rife with arrogant business people who bet the majority of their resources in defiance of a market that refused to accept their vision.
This isn't going to end well for 2X. I'm not here to debate it. I'm simply here to inform those who might save themselves by getting away from it before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:58:04
If 2X becomes a true alt-coin, then yes - miners will validate their blocks on the 2x network, and they will be rewarded. But that reward isn't likely to be very "rewarding" (see my continued analysis farther down the page).
If 2X attempts to usurp the Bitcoin network (as Garzik, Voorhees, Barry Silbert, and so many others have suggested), miners will attempt to validate their blocks against 90%+ of computers running Bitcoin Core software, and those blocks will be rejected. One would presume miners would immediately switch back to Core mining in order to remain profitable (because zero is, last time I checked, not profitable at all).
If 2X does become a true alt, it will be almost the same thing as BCash (but with SegWit). Some people have suggested this will hurt Bitcoin. I say that's just pure nonsense. BCash and 2x will be competing with each other all the way down to obscurity, while Bitcoin continues with its supremacy.
In this scenario, I believe BCash has a considerable advantage over 2X because BCash has replay protection. 2X will cause unfathomable nightmares, as exchanges and remittance companies deal with massive double-spends. Frankly, I doubt most exchanges will support 2X without replay protection. Of course, BCash's advantage doesn't mean it will succeed, because it certainly won't. BCash has no unique value proposition, and it is built on a foundation of lies, propaganda, and manipulation.
Finally, the moronic leaders like Erik Voorhees, Wences, Stephen Pair, et al - who do not properly understand what I've written here - seem hell-bent on converting their companies to the 2X product. There are only two outcomes:
1. 2X attempts to steal the Bitcoin network, in which case miners blocks are rejected, and they immediately switch back to Bitcoin. At that point, these dumbfuck CEOs will be left scrambling for recourse, dealing with years of misplaced self-confidence, wondering just how in the bloody hell the could have possibly missed something so obvious. Nevermind we spent years trying to explain it to them.
2. 2X is nothing more than a shitty alt, with a severe disadvantage even to BCash, and these CEOs are now transacting in a worthless digital currency.
Either way, Bitcoin's future is as bright as a supernova. It's going to be fun watching this circus unravel. I have a kitchen full of popcorn, and I am inviting all my friends over for the 2X/BCash Armageddon.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:53:20
You're mixing the arguments. If the 10% of nodes are running BIZCOIN as an alt, nobody from Core cares. Bitcoin remains status quo.
If the 10% BIZCOIN network is running BIZCOIN software, and its miners try to validate against 90% Core-driven nodes, their blocks will be rejected.
Either way, Coinbase and Bitpay (et al), will be running a coin that is NOT Bitcoin. What do you think Bitpay merchants are going to do when their clients' funds aren't accepted by the BIZCOIN network?
I guess we'll see.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:09:01
I recommend that you move the funds out of Coinbase. Your Coinbase wallet is really just an account at Coinbase. As long as it's in that wallet, Coinbase controls your private keys. And that's the reason for my original post.

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:04:16
I think you have over-estimated their power. And I think you have underestimated the number of computers on the network running Core (external to Coinbase and Bitpay).
I might have been more inclined to agree with you before the BCASH debacle. Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and all the rest were adamant that they had enough hash power and full nodes to take over the Bitcoin network. The threats were powerful and effective; many of us were genuinely concerned.
In the end, however, some more staid, rational voices pointed out that BCASH would have to convert the 90% or more of computers on the network that were running Core. And Jihan Wu, et al, knew this (although, of course, they never let that get in the way of their threats). In the end, Jihan Wu knew that he wouldn't have the nodes he needed to get his mined blocks verified - he knew they would be rejected by the majority of Core nodes. So Jihan tucked his tail between his legs, and tried to save face by issuing BCASH as an alt. 
Some people say the jury's still out on BCASH. I say BCASH is hovering at its apex, preparing for its descent at terminal velocity, and its imminent collision with earth.
You might make the argument that "this time is different." Maybe you believe companies like Coinbase and Bitpay have more of the network than Jihan, Roger, and all of their ilk. I would respectfully disagree with that assertion. But, in the end, I guess we'll see.
BCASH was a gift to Bitcoin holders (although many of them don't see that yet). Yes, it was free money. Why? Because it transferred a huge amount of wealth away from Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, et al, into the hands of the Bitcoin holders who converted it. As the BCASH to Bitcoin ratio falls, you can begin to understand how much of that wealth was transferred.
I believe 2X will also be an air drop, because I don't believe miners and exchanges are so arrogant and stupid as to believe they can actually capture enough nodes to have 2X blocks validated. As such, I believe Bitcoin holders are going to receive another dividend - this time transferring the wealth of 2X supporters to the hands of Bitcoin holders who convert.
And if 2X miners and exchanges do believe they have enough nodes to validate their blocks? I believe that scenario will last about 30 minutes - at which point 2X miners' blocks will be worth precisely zero, and they will jump back to the Core chain as fast as they possibly can.

If Coinbase refuses to withdraw, and they fail to capture the majority of economic nodes, mined BIZCOIN blocks will be rejected, and Coinbase will go from being the biggest Bitcoin exchange, to being a broken has-been exchange that only serves three or four alts.
I daresay, that would be the end of Coinbase.

I believe most Core devs are for a safe, responsible hard fork at some point. But I also think most people agree at this point that we may be able to avoid a block-size increase (via hard fork) if 2nd-layer solutions continue to show the promise SegWit and lightning are showing us.

That turned out to be false.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:00:22
In 2012, several rogue miners tried to reject the first halving by following a chain that continued to grant them 50 Bitcoin rewards. Because they had almost zero nodes running their software (non-consensus), and because the majority of the Bitcoin network was running the new software (what would later be known as "Core"), their blocks were rejected.
They came back to Core immediately.
Economic nodes determine who is going to own the Bitcoin network. If you believe the network can simply be bought by the highest bidder, you are ignorant of Bitcoin's history, and you simply don't understand the way Bitcoin works. 
Coinbase, Bitpay, et al cannot simply have the Bitcoin network simply because they have more money, more hash power, or more transactions. They have to own the majority of the economic nodes on the network. They do not, and they will not. Ever. If they continue to support this 2X fork, it will be disastrous for them - for all the reasons I gave in my original post.

This isn't a very good thought experiment, because the likelihood of 2X succeeding is basically so close to zero that it IS zero. It would be liking asking, "if every person on earth suddenly developed the ability to breathe under water, would that change anything for you?" 
Yes. Yes it would. :-)
I'll play along. I would no longer believe in Bitcoin if 2X were somehow to miraculously succeed. It would become PayPal 2.0 - which Roger Ver predicted and hoped for in the spring of 2016. I have no use for a project that invites government scrutiny, and can be changed on a whim by a handful of CEOs in a private meeting to which neither developers nor users were invited.
That isn't Bitcoin. It would almost certainly never be allowed to be anonymous. KYC/AML would almost certainly be baked into its protocol. The 21 million cap would almost certainly be lifted at some point in the future - probably sooner, rather than later - defeating its anti-inflationary mandate, and opening the door to dilution (similar to secondary stock offerings).
How is any of that interesting to people who got involved with Bitcoin as it is today? At that point, it's no longer Bitcoin. It really is just a slower version of PayPal. In that scenario, Bitcoin just becomes a new arm of the global financial status quo - the very thing it was designed to defeat.
If 2X succeeds, I believe Monero is going to the moon. That is the project in which I would have the most interest right now. And, of course, I believe most Core devs would start another project to replace the correct and true Bitcoin. I would put my resources firmly behind that project, as well.
I know I'm not alone. If 2X succeeds, the brightest, best minds in this community will leave it forever. It might keep the name, and it might survive in its new form for a time, but it will never be the true "Bitcoin" again. The experiment will move elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:03:05
That's not true. If five guys with millions of dollars only have five nodes running BIZCOIN software, and a million guys with only $10,000 between them have 1,000 nodes running Core software, the guys with the 1000 nodes running Core are going to win (hands down).
The five guys with millions of dollars won't be able to get their mined blocks validated on the Core network. They will either have to become a true alt (like BCASH), or the BIZCOIN miners will switch back to Core. Or, of course, both could happen.
I'm still not sure how people have failed to understand that Bitcoin was designed *specifically* to ensure that the richest players can't simply buy the network. If you think this is untrue, you really, really don't understand how Bitcoin works.
But if you doubt me, then why hasn't some nation-state, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and/or every other enemy of Bitcoin simply bought the network?
(spoiler: because they can't. Bitcoin doesn't work that way.)
If Coinbase and Bitpay think they can just buy the Bitcoin network, they are in for a rude awakening. And when I just can't overstate the magnitude of "rude" in this context. It's going to be a total disaster for them.

I don't mean they're adopting BIZCOIN, of course! I mean they're adopting the name BIZCOIN! Because it really works, if you think about it for a second. BIZCOIN.
I hope you can get used to it. BIZCOIN, I mean. Not an actual BIZCOIN (because it's going to fail, so it will be hard to get used to something that basically goes away). But the concept of BIZCOIN.
It's like the Bitcoin that businesses hoped they could create by stealing the Bitcoin network for their own. But they can't (because they just can't manage to control enough of those pesky economic nodes). Still, do you see? Can you see it? Business + Coin? BIZCOIN?
(I know you see it. I'm just messin'.)
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:42:59
The scenario you're describing is no different from BCASH. If BIZCOIN becomes an alt, and it's more lucrative to mine, then some miners will mine it. That's true.
But if they try to validate those blocks against the Bitcoin network, running a majority of Bitcoin Core software, those blocks will be rejected. They will only be valid on the alt-BIZCOIN network. Just like BCASH blocks will not be validated on the Bitcoin network, if BIZCOIN is an alt, its blocks will not be validated on the Bitcoin network.
There are two different arguments:
1. BIZCOIN is a true alt, in which case, BCASH has already shown us what will happen to BIZCOIN.
2. BIZCOIN (via Coinbase and Bitpay, et al) will attempt to usurp the Bitcoin network by attempting to obtain more economic nodes running its software than Core does. But I think it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. If Coinbase, Bitpay, et al, take this gamble and lose, their businesses will almost certainly fail.
You are mixing the arguments, I believe.

In the other, BIZCOIN tries to gain more economic nodes than Core. Can it take away the 90%+ nodes that Core currently owns? Nobody with any sense really thinks there's even the slightest chance.
And you are correct, most of the people in this argument try to mix these two scenarios in order to come up with an ideal picture that fits their preference. But that is the mistake, isn't it?
Spread the word...

Okay. I guess we'll see. Thanks.
In the meantime - since I'm "wrong," and all that - can you tell us how a node that processes more money has a stronger "vote" on the Bitcoin network than a node that processes less money?
More specifically, can you tell us what part of the Bitcoin white paper - or can you point to any BIP or code or plugin, or nuance, or magic, or whatever - tells us that nodes processing more money have more impact than nodes that process less money?
Thanks in advance. And if you know about something I don't know, then I apologize in advance. Because this would, indeed, be news to me.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:14:39
You haven't been listening. More than 90% of the nodes on the Bitcoin network currently run Core software. Coinbase doesn't have the resources to run enough economically viable nodes to displace Core's dominance. If they try, they will waste vast resources, and be left with an alt-coin that nobody wants to use (if they fail).
The risk is too great. You don't understand the way Bitcoin network validation works.

You're not thinking of the right signed agreements. There have been several agreements signed by companies (and CEOs) - during the eras of Classic, XT, Unlimited, and now. Search it.
You don't see evidence of companies withdrawing from the NYA agreement? Then you aren't paying attention. Several of them have already withdrawn. More are starting to show reservation. Again, a simple internet search will help you here.
It's strange that you refer to the HK agreement, yet earlier in your response, you didn't. Are you purposely trying to dodge the fact that many agreements have been signed, and that they meant nothing in the end?
I'm not here to debate who wants a hard fork. We all want a hard fork. But the most responsible of us want it done....well... responsibly. Four months doesn't qualify.
So here we are, and 2X is going to hurt a lot of companies when it fails. Best to stop trying to debate me (because I'm pretty certain of the outcome) and start thinking about what it's going to mean when 2X blows up.
Thanks for the response.

You know, in a passionate, heated battle like this one - full of insults and accusations - it's refreshing to get a well-reasoned, calm response like yours. I only specifically point that out because it's rare, and I really appreciate it.
You and I agree, I think, on every point except one: u/evoorhees is the enemy. I'll even grant you the point that he is articulate and well-spoken. But that doesn't absolve him of his sins. He has been contradictory, evasive, and dishonest with his intentions, as well as with his conclusions. It is so clear, at this point, that he has a specific, well-designed agenda. I do not trust him, and I do not think anyone else should trust him - silver-tongued though he may be.
Erik's biggest flaw, however, seems to be his inability to keep quiet. You are correct in your observation that Coinbase has remained (wisely) silent. Erik has been extremely vocal. He has, I fear, so infused his ego in the debate that he no longer has a viable means of "saving face," as it were. He seems to be so entrenched and bitter that it would appear he intends to pursue the hard fork even to the detriment of his company and its users. When I say this, I'm specifically referring to his extremely adamant insistence that replay protection is either not necessary, or is Core's burden (depending on what day and what thread he happens to be engaging).
I used to admire Erik deeply. I have almost (almost!) as little respect for him today as I have for Roger Ver. And that ain't much...
Thank you again for such a civil and patient response. You honestly made me feel guilty for my cynical character assassinations (but only briefly :) )

You need to move your coins to a wallet you control. I recommend:
1. Bitcoin Core wallet (full blockchain).
2. Electrum wallet (SPV)
3. Samourai wallet (Android)
If you don't understand what this means, you need to do the research. It's important.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:23:19
UASF is the only reason we have SegWit today. And you are correct: a minority can affect change with a grass roots movement - if the economic majority approves.
If the 2X minority believes it can corral an economic majority, as UASF did, then 2X will win, and Bitcoin will change. I have two responses to this:
1. I don't believe 2X has an economic majority. If Coinbase, Bitpay, et al, risk trying to convince the world that 2X actually IS Bitcoin, and they wind up being wrong (if 2X loses), these companies risk losing 100% of their users. This is already a highly competitive field, and taking this sort of risk is extremely dangerous - especially for a company like Bitpay, which is already on the financial brink of collapse.
2. If 2X wins, Bitcoin will be changed in such a way that it will lose all of its Core developers, and it will be vulnerable to politically-charged mandates - like KYC/AML, and raising the 21 million cap. Most of us who have been around a while do not see these changes as positive. Indeed, most of us think this will mean the slow death of Bitcoin. Speaking for myself, were this to happen, I would exercise my exit strategy and move to different projects (like Monero, and possibly DeCred). I would absolutely get behind any project that the majority of Core devs jumped to.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:02:48
Implementing 2x is a completely different path - both technically and philosophically. In addition to a very, very unsafe hard fork (untested, and created by a grossly untalented developer, Jeff Garzik), BIZCOIN sets the precedent that a handful of companies can dictate the future of Bitcoin.
A responsible, slow hard fork created, tested, and guided by Core would bolster and galvinize an equally powerful precept: Bitcoin is going to progress as a meritocracy, not at the whim of a few ignorant CEOs.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:46:39
New or not, you are the smartest person here, today. Good for you. If more people followed your path, 90% of the nightmares in the space would be avoided.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:47:16
Then you don't understand Bitcoin, and you don't understand the gamble BIZCOIN proponents are making if they move forward.
Nodes are exactly the opposite of what you have presented: the node count *does* matter, and the number of transactions running through that node do not give it more power - whether it's one transaction, or a thousand.
What you're missing is that nodes have to run software. If the majority of nodes run Core software, then BIZCOIN blocks won't be validated and will be rejected. the reverse is also true.
The problem for Coinbase is that, no matter how many transactions they're running through nodes that currently support BIZCOIN software, they are literally going against the 90%+ of the rest of the ENTIRE WORLD, that is running Core software. Unless Coinbase, Bitpay, et al think they can spin up enough *economically viable* nodes to counter the 90%+ advantage Core enjoys - or unless these companies think they can convince this majority to uninstall Core software and replace it with BIZCOIN software, then the game is already over.
Jihan Wu, Roger Ver and crew threatened for years to fork the network with more hash power and economic nodes. The hash power was the obvious bluff, but people were actually scared they might have the economic nodes.
Jihan Wu knew he would *not* have enough economically viable nodes, of course. His threats didn't work, and he backed down - creating the alt BCASH, instead of stupidly trying to steal the Bitcoin network (and losing everything). Sure, BCASH will fail, but he was able to recoup some of the costs by foisting them off on the fools on r/btc.
This is what Coinbase faces. Coinbase is not full of stupid people. They know this will never work. They are remaining silent and waiting to see if it gains any traction at all. But, of course, it won't. Ask Jihan.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:11:39
Thank you again for such a clear and civil post.
u/evoorhees has said on many, many occasions that he believes Core is responsible for replay protection. If he wants to rescind that, then it helps.
Erik has said many times that Bitcoin's biggest and most urgent issue is the block size. And yet he steadfastly refuses to implement SegWit at Shapeshift - despite numerous offers of technical assistance.
Erik has claimed to have a clear understanding of how splits and forks work, yet he has made grave public errors about this understanding. Again, when some of the best minds in the space have corrected him, he has neither acknowledged his mistakes, nor apologized for his arrogance. His method? Silence or deflection.
If Erik understood this debate, he would understand the risk he is imposing on his company, his employees, and his users. Yet he continues with his dogmatic, entrenched position.
At the very least, Erik should implement SegWit immediately at Shapeshift. But more appropriately, Erik should immediately withdraw support for BIZCOIN, because it is dangerous, it no longer serves a purpose, and it is doomed to failure.
This may be the place where we agree to disagree. Come November, I have no doubt that poeple like you and me will recognize the strengths and weaknesses, and come together to compare notes and move forward.
I don't believe people like Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees are capable of that. But I also think that the market has a way of dealing with that level of arrogance.
I hope I haven't offended you, and I want to thank you again for taking the time to give such a thorough and thoughtful response. And you are correct: I should be focusing more on the tech, and avoiding character assassinations. You got me there. :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:06:30
And what you're not understanding is that the scenario you're describing would make the 10%-ers an alt (like BCASH). If that happens, BIZCOIN will be an alt. That's fine. But they won't have the Bitcoin network. They will not be Bitcoin.
BCASH made the same argument. Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, et al, threatened, cajoled, manipulated, and propagandized for years - claiming miners and hash power would give them the most valuable network. And yet, that didn't happen, and BCASH is failing.
If Coinbase, Bitpay, et al continue down this path, their fork will be an alt, and they will no longer be Bitcoin service providers. They will be BIZCOIN service providers. They will either have to reverse course (very expensive), or die.
Two recap, you are incorrectly combining two distinct and mutally exclusive scenarios:
1. BIZCOIN becomes a true fork, like BCASH. At that point, Coinbase's bet is a huge loss.
2. Coinbase tries to take over the Bitcoin network by running BIZCOIN economic nodes. Coinbase will never have the resources to accomplish this, and it will lose.
If you don't believe me, I guess we'll see. Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:44:05
You make good points. It's clear that you've put some thought into this. I hope I can help allay some of your fears by saying that I think you are giving Bitcoin's attackers too much credit. My understanding is that Bitcoin is now the biggest computer network in the world (behind the Internet, itself). If this is true, it's not going to be a small thing to take control of it...
Thank you for the response.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:11:02
You're thinking of it as stock split. That's not accurate.
At the time of the fork, if you have 1 Bitcoin, you will receive 1 B2X, as well.
Each will be worth a separate amount on exchanges, and OTC markets. The price isn't set by the fork, but rather by the market.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:08:32
I believe you are mistaken. The value of the transactions running through a node doesn't matter (as long as it's more than zero). It's the software the node is running, and what percentage of the network is running the software that validates miners' blocks.
90%+ of the Bitcoin network currently runs Core software. Coinbase isn't likely to affect that enough to usurp the network. It doesn't matter if they run $1 or $10million through a node. If more economic nodes run Core software, then non-Core blocks will be rejected.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:09:20
Okay. I guess we'll see. I can't keep repeating myself.
If you think Coinbase can simply buy the network, you don't understand the history and tech behind Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:38:03
I agree. But if the cost of litigation is less (far less) than the benefit of carry during that litigation, then it would make a lot of sense to do it anyway.
If I were running a company, and my ethical behaviour was determined by potential profit, then I would consider the cost-benefit on this scheme. 
Many of the B2X company leaders have demonstrated more than once that their ethical foundation can be swayed by profit. Erik Voorhees and Stephen Pair are especially conspicuous in their willingness to bend, switch, and twist their positions in order to justify a course -- even if it isn't ethical (or maybe even legal).
tl;dr - I wouldn't be surprised at all if people like Erik Voorhees were to say, "Let's just do it. We'll use the profit to pay the lawyers."

Erik, we have all seen your endless contradictions and inconsistencies, all over the internet - most glaringly on Twitter. Bizcoin is moot at this point, and yet you persist, despite countless ironclad explanations from some of the most talented developers on earth.
You, however, are not a developer, and yet you condescend to these brilliant minds, ignorant of the peril your company and your users face. You are the very embodiment of arrogance, and if you continue down this path, you deserve everything that happens to you. I just hope those who follow you can see how foolish you are before it's too late.
If SegWit2X fails to obtain enough economic nodes to usurp the Bitcoin network (and it will), any company depending on its success will struggle or fail. Your myopia and entrenchment will not serve you well. You would be smart to stop dictating, to surround yourself with unbiased technologists who understand how Bitcoin really works, and to quietly, humbly ask them where you've gone wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:07:31
I think you should probably research your statement: "Non-mining nodes do not validate blocks." That is not correct.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:49:46
Well, I don't know what to tell you. BCASH is an alt. It's "viability" is questionable; there is no reason for it to have the market cap it currently enjoys - other than the explanation that it is artificially supported. That theory is further bolstered by the nearly precise 10:1 ratio it maintains with Bitcoin. There's no clear economic reason for such a relationship to exist.
BIZCOIN does not have more support than BCASH. If you believe that's true, I would implore you to point to hard figures.
For my part, I will point to the fact that the world's biggest miner, one of Bitcoin's largest investors, and almost certainly a nation-state (or five) are behind BCASH with a lot of money. But that hasn't helped it a bit.
Again, if you think the Bitcoin network is available to the highest bidder, you just don't understand Bitcoin.
BCASH and BIZCOIN aren't hurting Bitcoin at all. They're helping it. Bitcoin was designed to get stronger from malicious attacks. That is exactly what has happened throughout its history.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:53:33
They are rapidly fixing themselves. As much as I see BCASH and 2X as malicious attacks on Bitcoin, they have raised awareness and made Bitcoin much stronger. For that, I think we will all be grateful, once they are dead.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:06:30
You nailed it. But I think the other reasons are equally important. I just don't see how Coinbase can take this gamble.

Ryan X Charles (Yours) is a complete fool. He irrationally and mendaciously pushed for Bitcoin Unlimited - and bigger blocks - only to switch to Litecoin when it adopted SegWit.
I've been a professional investor for almost 40 years, and I've watched tepid entrepreneurs come and go with all the capriciousness (and motivation) of house flies. The best are always consistent and moral. The worst invariably switch their loyalties and vision to suit short-term profit.
Ryan X Charles and Yours won't be around long. The switch to Litecoin was as predictable as it was stupid. Bitcoin is going to to be just fine. Any companies that "switch" are hurting themselves. I can, perhaps, see an argument for accepting other currencies besides Bitcoin, but abandoning it is just moronic.

You've lost. Saying my words represent the "wrongness" of the Bitcoin community shows how absolutely ignorant your perspective is; I am merely the messenger. Bitcoin will do exactly (precisely) what it was designed to do, whether I comment on it or not.
You're anger is misplaced. Nobody likes to lose, but you went against the protocol. What did you think would happen? Bitcoin isn't simply going to roll over and die because a handful of subpar zealots believe it's better off as a decentralized, miner-controlled, PayPal 2.0.

You need to read the EXCELLENT articles by Aaron van Wirdum and Giacomo Zucco. They will tell you everything you need to know.
tl;dr there won't be a chain split or a hard fork. It won't even get close. SegWit is coming no matter what. Beyond that, rational miners will always cheat. The support for a split/fork will never materialize.
Any miners that try it are going to be mining a very valueless alt. Again, game theory. Miners aren't stupid.

The future is uncertain because an Ethereum stakeholder-minority has displayed - several times - that its rules are arbitrary, and selectively beneficial.

This doesn't go far enough. Ethereum is DOA because of its unlimited supply, and its mutability. 
Bitcoin and Ethereum are indeed two different things (although Rootstock is about to change that in a massive way). But Ethereum cannot defy fundamental economic laws forever; unlimited supply and mutability will destroy any semblance of scarcity. That will be its undoing.
Believe what you prefer. I am just the messenger. Bitcoin is one of those rare things that is so good from the start that it has:
1. Innumerable imitators.
