We were not aware of any "silent" bundling - just offers be shown to the user upon uTorrent install.  We haven't been able to reproduce the issue but are taking it seriously and continuing to test to try to reproduce it.
It's part of our company because we legitimately want to benefit the world via research and donations and to have our users be a part of that.

We really believe in privacy and providing the user with a choice.  We  would never accept a silent install.  Neither us or uTorrent or the various news outlets that have covered the story have been able to reproduce the silent install - the offer is shown.
Regardless, we are taking this issue seriously and talking to our distribution partner (uTorrent) to continue testing.
If anyone did have a silent install or doesn't want the software on their computer, we can personally help you with removal.  We are also posting installation instructions on our website shortly.
The easiest way is to remove Epic Scale via Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove programs.  Then right click on Epic Scale and Uninstall.
If that isn't working for you, do the following:
    -Open Task Manager
    -Find EpicScale.exe
    -Choose "End Process"
    -Do this again for a second EpicScale.exe process (You must stop both epicscale.exe processes quickly)
    -Delete the folder "C:\Program Data\Epic Scale"

The current allegations of silent installs are separate from accidental installs via the uTorrent installer.  The claim is that no offer was shown. Period.
However, we don't want accidental installs either. We want users who are interested in joining the network.  We can work on improving the offer screen. Do you have any suggestions on how we can do so?

Epic Scale is separate from the torrent software and the process is low priority.  We only use full CPU when the computer is idle for extended periods of time.  When in use, we limit our usage dramatically - you can turn this functionality off in the UI.

For what it's worth, so far 100% of ES profits from mining and research have gone to charity.  Our long term plan is a sustainable 75%.
We will work on finding a way to prove this.

We do use a very high difficulty.  Bandwidth usage should be very small after the initial install.

We do offer ES non-bundled via our website.  However, we'd like to grow our network and the best way to do that is via advertising.  I view the offer in the installation path as an advertisement, albeit maybe one we could improve given your feedback.
For reference, Skype advertises via bundled installs as well, and is considered by many to be useful and positive software.
If it was kept as a bundled install (and I understand you think it would be better to separate it), do you have any feedback on how to improve what users see?
