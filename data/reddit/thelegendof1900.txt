I always sell low and buy high. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:23:15
Takes forever though. Last time it took 6 days!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:33:24
Most people can't afford an entire coin at this point. I think 2500-5k was the average guy limit.

Yeah but it was a nice christmas 15% off sale
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:41:58

He said wait another week for low fees. What does that mean?

@_date: 2018-09-09 21:41:30
I still don't get it..  What does it mean? He bought btc at $6.269? and then the value went up so he lost it somehow? ELI5 literally please.

@_date: 2017-12-17 15:47:17
Lots of people say that. You'd be surprised.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:26:19
Well that was stupid..
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:23:00
back to $16.9k already!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:08
why? how? coinbase fees are killing me
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:48:45
Thanks for the explanation. I actually understand this finally!
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:22:23
Thats the thing. coinbase is instant, gdax takes days.

Can someone ELI5 this? I see these posts all the time and I understand that they bet on bitcoin or shorted bitcoin but can you decipher the picture and explain how the information is read?
What does "liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 7,632,435 @ 6269" mean? Then it says "100 100 100 100" a bunch of times.
I don't understand what I am looking at here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:34:42
Holy fuck this is nerve wracking lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:45
That's my problem. I love the gdax interface. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:17:42

@_date: 2017-08-17 07:26:45
It is so hard to buy bitcoin. My bank keeps flagging the charges as fraud then the stupid broker wont accept my ID verification. I tried coinbase and cex. Frustrated.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:19:26
Thank you. Upvoted and no woosh!

@_date: 2017-11-17 01:43:11
I used coinbase. Still dont have my btc that I bought at 5800 but the price is locked in and I paid a small price for a large gain
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:04:23
Why though? A small fee vs a nice gain is an easy decision.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:01:10
median house price in my city is 803k =(
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:33:52
wait... so btc price will instantly double?!
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:45:08
Coinbase does have instant purchase. 500 debit and 5k bank
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:27:47
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:54:52
Coinbase fees are nothing compared to the massive gainz nigga!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:18:24
It is definitely Jif. Like Giraffe or Geronimo or Geriatric
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:44:36
Coinbase does have instant purchase. 500 debit and 5k bank. I do not understand your point... NVM this is going in circles.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:29:12
I bought today anyway, a dip is a dip. Last buy was 4250. before that 3750 and so on.

@_date: 2017-09-28 04:42:16
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:27:57
Good, then i can buy whole coins!!
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:28:30
dip or no dip, buy now!
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:50:05
Do you honestly think it will dip that much? Its climbing so fast that my weekly buys wont amount to much soon.

ELI5: What does this mean? What is a node? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:08:25
How do you use segwit? I went to the site but is just one big confusing chart. There is no login or btc prices or sign up or anything. I use coinbase currently.
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:52:51
Thanks. I got it. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:17:42
I bought more too. HODL MOFOS
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:33:50
HODL is good but I like your idea as well. Maybe HODL some and day trade some.

Whats a better alternative?
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:54:26
That would be fucking awesome. I will keep buying regardless. $500 a week should keep me in a good position for the future.

Requests from a fan: I want the game to rotate so I can play in landscape format. Also, can you dim the ads somehow? The game is rather dark and the glaringly bright white ads at the bottom make it a bit uncomfortable/distracting on the eyes. Thanks for the great game!
