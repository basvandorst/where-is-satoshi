only buy BTC if you can do the trade in person
websites act as banks in the BTC world

one of two things could happen
1) Bitcoin dies
2) Bitcoin skyrockets to like $1k, people start offloading bitcoins &amp; a bitcoin earning system is added to replace the outdated mining system

people buy when news hits but after that nothing besides mining
bitcoin is mostly mining so once that dies BTC will most likly follow unless we give it some much needed reforms

no one gets hand outs, most bitcoiners do hand ins just so they can stay in the BTC game
i earn them which you can't do with the acting BTC system. you can use BTC sites to earn a tiny bit but they burn out fast &amp; the BTC jobs pay a slave wage

I haven't heard of any yet but I think that's because ISPs don't see Bitcoin as a real form of money

the cost of one bitcoin &amp; the fact that it is mining based right now are BIG turnoffs
bitcoin needs reforms, make bitcoins like 1 to 10$ so people can join the network, lower the mining, bring in a earning system so the new blood can earn some BTC &amp; build up the network

when bitcoin was made a bitcoiner could get 50 BTC in like 10-30 mins but now you have to mine days to get maybe 50 BTC
the party is over, new bitcoiners are FORCED to buy BTC because the system is so outdated
the jobs 4 bitcoin thing is a joke, they are most likely the round 1 bitcoiners so they have loads of BTC to blow but they pay like 0.000005

there was a time for mining but that time is over now we need to build the network up so bitcoin will get picked up by big companies
we want bitcoin to grow but we won't upgrade it
