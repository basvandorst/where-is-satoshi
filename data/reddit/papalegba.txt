The value of ETH (i.e in BTC, not USD) is **derived** from the underlying price of Bitcoin and thus my statement. 
As long as any volatile movement in BTC (especially during bear markets) influences the price of ETH i.e pulls it down along, it is a derivative of BTC.
Tether (USDT) is not a derivative or Bitcoin but of USD.
Technically if USD collapses so should/will USDT.

@_date: 2018-01-17 23:01:45
The word 'all' was a figure of speech. ICOs are an ETH derivative while ETH is a BTC derivative. They all follow the underlying Bitcoin price 
Can ETH can survive a BTC bear market? Can ALT sustain their price with a wild BTC FUD?
Get back to me when those clauses are satisfied and I'll change my word.
The reality is most if not all ALTs are a means to gain more BTC (if not USD).
Since TP of BTC is in USD, guess what those who like it not and underly their coins in USD are forced to be dictated by their value of BTC.
If me if I'm wrong but the correlation has proved itself time and time again when Bitcoin turns bear. 
That is why ALT shill are nothing but crypto gollum terrorist who try to kill the golden goose and in return shoot themselves (along with everyone else) on the foot.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:49:03

Fair enough. Now hear me out again and lets hold back on terminology for a second.
* If Bitcoin was to lost 50% of its value tomorrow, what are the odds that ETH is value in USD would stay intact?
* What if ETH lost 50% of its value tomorrow, what are the odds of BTC is value (no need to mention USD, right) staying intact. 
* Now you assume which one would be the underlying price and which one would be trading on future speculation if we had both ETH &amp; BTC settle their price in USD on a fixed date.
You see we can agree that one is extremely depended on the others support while it isn't necessary to be true on the other side. The word is correction but I'm using derivative because in reality if you kill one (BTC, underlying assest) the rest will crash/die as well by settlement (ALT, futures).
Again I using derivatives as a smuck way of say, don't kill the golden goose. 
A lot of shill for every sub come here to proclaim why Bitcoin is dead. When they poke it enough, the entire building (which they live under as well) starts to crumble. 
Now would it be practically (not technically) fair to say that their value is derived from Bitcoin?

Coming back fresh with a clean slate and a new game plan can be a lovely thing.
I was in and out of Bitcoin from 2014-15 but couldn't hodl and gave up on it when my girl passed away that year.
Paired up with a family friend run a startup only to realise he way ripping me of my share. Every penny I put to build that startup when down the drain and so did the business with my departure.
Worked for a month as an intern to perform night audits (closing the accounts) in the hotel industry. The pay was joke with no self-time to scale so I politely quit.
Got back into Bitcoin by mid of Jun '16. That very week after my first purchase Bitfinex got hacked and the price dropped by 15%. I was like why the fuck does shit like this keep happening to me.
Fast forward '17 and I'm glad for all the shit life threw at me in the past.
All I can say is some mBTC every week can stack up to a significant value in time.

I suggest you use an exchange instead of a broker (Coinbase).
Here is what you should be doing.
1) Send $X to an exchange and have that absolute same value credited to you. 
eg: Send $100 USD from bank and have $100 USD credited on the exchange.
2) Place a market/limit order to buy BTC worth $100.
Lets assume the market order fee was 0.75%. So you would receive $99.25 worth of BTC.
3) If you want to send $99.25 to your hardware wallet and the fees is $9.25 (10%), rationality will tell you you don't.
4) What your should do it accumulate 10 x $99.25 purchases. Doing so will leave you with $992.5 worth of BTC.
5) Moving Funds: With a principle of $992.5, you would now be paying $9.25 (1%) fees for making sure *my keys, my coins* aka send your funds preferably to a hardware wallet.
I would strongly advice you to move from a brokers i.e. Coinbase (buys from an exchange, sells it to users at premium) to an exchange (preferable Bitstamp cause of their rep).
Don't hesitate to shoot any question if you further have any doubt.

You won't get anywhere with BTC by a one time purchase.
If you don't trade then use DCA/BCA and buy some every week periodically.  Don't over or under invest. 
If you don't have money for the next week means you have over invested or* basically went all in.
Have an attitude where you win either way.
When BTC goes down, its great cause you get to bring your average buying price lower.
When it goes up, your BTC gains value against Fiat. Don't let that* stop you from your periodic DCA/BCA purchases as accumulation phase is vastly underrated. 
Having substantial skin in the game with 5 to 10X is way better than dumping just a $100 bill with 100X. Aim for the prior and let your dreams take care of the latter. 
Happy Hodlidays!

You clearly know that I was talking about the miners delaying the activation of SEGWIT.
What you may look at lost time is also an opputunity accumulate coins.
Firstly if you adopt SEGWIT the fees are drastically reduced. Secondly Fees are measured in Bitcoin. Then there is lightning but you don't believe (or are willing to be patient) in the long term gratification of 65,000 tx/sec. 
Logic 101 will tell you that the sats/byte in USD will increase as the price increases. 
Again, from this conversation you have absolutely no incentives to stick around (period). 
Its human nature to shit take Bitcoin the moment one goes short. Whats sic is the motive to panic dupe newbs to gather their coins at a cheaper rate.
Again, as a trade I'm open to playing both ways but would never go on forum to shake the naive. 
As an investor, your only responsibility it to manage your own fund. If r/Bitcoin wouldn't* get you to your goal then you after better off unsubscribing and moving on to this that you actually beilive in. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:27

E) Thank you traders for providing liquidity to Bitcoin and move it to one of the biggest assets class that man feels safe to store his wealth.
F) Thank you new adopters for having faith in every true hodler who'll support and take any price to their grave.
G) Last and none the least, thank you Satoshi for showing the true way of hodling. You have seen infinite corrections and never been sodl by the greed of infinite fiat. No hodler could every have a grow a pair to this magnitude had you not set the path and shown us how to hodl while living under a rock, ocean or whatever that absolute opposite of greed is.
H) Thanks you everyone in this economy for making my hands strong. We all are satoshis and the average sum of all our  Hodling can be represented in a single BTC.

Yes you are. Also do consider using Bitstamp or Gemini to purchase and move coins. The market rate on those exchanges are cheaper than Coinbase (broker) and so are the fees.
Do consider investing in an harware wallet like Ledger Nano S once you have 20 to 50 times the cost of a unit. 
The current cost of a Nano S is €58 so look into one after you hodl more than €1000.

While I agree with all your points you missed one critical aspect. Bitcoin is the 'golden goose' that will make Governments turn against each other.
A simple use case of this is when currencies pegged to the USD/EUR start secretly hedging themselves buy hodling Bitcoin thus putting a selling pressure on those top-tier FX currencies. 
It one takes one to create self doubt and the rest will shiver.
Bitcoin is just an unbiased blackhole that will crack the fear/greed of men who sit in parliament. 
BTC isn't stuck with humans but humans are stuck with it. It was never meant to make your rich but to safely secure ones wealth from a biased system of this insane inflationary fiat regime. The very fact that it appreciate at this rate further validates our belief in an decentralized economy.

You can't buy the dip with your BTC/Fiat without movements like this. 
We should ideally retest some lows before making new ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:05
Think about it. Without healthy corrections like these, no one will keep being incentived to buy the dip.
Be grateful becuase the rest can increase their HODLings.

Really heart warming story OP. Your mom would be proud to you have you as her son.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:01
Firstly congrats on poking your nose for ~~advice~~/~~guidance~~ my insight.
Before I go any further, you will &amp; have to in time adopt and understand the speculative nature of these crypto markets. 
For starters, **every Altcoin is measure in BTC &amp; not USD.**
Let me give you an e.g. of a Bitcoin Dilema: You have $2000 worth of Fiat on an exchange. *BTC* is $20k &amp; an ALT called *XYZ* is 0.01 BTC aka $200.
Lets say you brought $1000 worth of BTC and receive 0.05 BTC (excluding trading fees). With the other $1000 you got 5 XYZ with is also worth 0.05 BTC.
Now let's say XYZ is valued at 0.04 BTC @ $240.
You lost 20% BTC and gain 20% Fiat. Did you lose or make money? You pretty much lose 20% of your Bitcoin. So why did you gain 20% Fiat?
I'll leave this here for you to analyse but don't hesitate to ask me if your stuck.
Altcoin developers may like it or not ( be it a legit or scammy protect) but real crypto trader will never hodl an alt beyond its overvalued price in BTC. The people who bag hodl and lose those juicy BTC profits are the one who are fixated on an ever deprecating Fiat (USD) value. 
So what happen when BTC drops 10% and other Alt are up 10 to 20% in BTC value? Its  simple. 
BTC had a crazy bull run forcing every Alt trader to hodl bags at -20%, -35%, -45%.
Why does this happen? Because markets appear irrational. Since no alts ever die, a BTC dagger at -70% will still somehow find support.  This is the start of a pump and dump ride.
Here is where an honest soul says (with TA) I'll try to grown my 0.05 BTC to 0.06 BTC
I hope you can get the correlation between a bullish bitcoin, altcoin and fiat.
The illusion of alts will disappear if Bitcoin turly BEAR for X period of time. Altcoin will/can  drop 40% to 50% (this is the biggest risk of any top and every top tier coin) in a day. This is because money us temp pounding out of CRYPTO to sit in cash (fiat) so they can 1.15X, 1.25X, 1.33X their Bitcoin Hodlings.
The macro fundamentals of Bitcoin will keep this game running while the micro fundamentals of Altcoins will hint towards pumps and dumps. 
**Coming back to your situation**
option a) is is being reckless and so is option b).
Reflect back for a second and think the roulette options of red and black you put forward. I won't go into those details unless you can't find the answer to it.
Here is my recommendation which you should question and adopt for your own.
 
1) Buy BTC periodically on a weekly basis.
2) Never go all in because fear and greed will take over and the result is ruins. Buy btc/alt high and sell low.
3) Do you love Fiat or Bitcoin? My store of wealth is BTC so I can't sleep with a trade hanging in fiat. The same way you've got to fix your unit of account and decide which  base currency would you hodl your wealth in. P.S the long term answer is never Alt.
4) Develop a mindset to always take yourvprofits in Bitcoin. You can so this with BTC or ALT.
5) BTC preservation is the name of the game.
TLDR: I would only buy Altcoins (w/ TA) to gain more BTC. 
I would never go all in and risk being broke on dip. 
Try to grasp these situations and understand how people make and lose BTC.
Your goal should be to convert fiat (rationally) to BTC and preserve it. From there your skills will determine if you can gain or lose more BTC (not fiat).
Try to start slow and grow from there. I'll always be here and never give up on you as long as you stay to true to the objectives of this space. Alternatively you can go you own way and play the 'FUD BTC and pump my bag' to gain more BTC but the venom will catch up sooner or later.
Its better to play the honest game and not dump the naive while gaining skills on your own.
I'll get into TA ( to gain more BTC) later on but for now understand the vast risk of touching the stove with Altcoins. If you irrationally buy Alts, traders like me will have no option but to cut you short and eat your BTC. Don't make these mistakes without a strong reasons to identify valid trendline breaks to the upside, sticking to stop losses and letting profits runs.
P.S: I hadn't proof read this comments so do overlooks any typos. 
Just understand this macro view and I'll get back to you on your 2k (:
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:54:15
Well that what you get when you invest in a scam. If you believe the same with BTC then  the r/unsub is right around the corner. 
Or maybe sock puppets don't get sats if they don't post a shitty analogy.
EDIT: And while your at it please share me Bitcoin's EPS so I know management isn't fucking with me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:04:03
Nah you won't. The price may temp us around $10 to $12k. I reckon not a single smart penny will sell sub $10k.
From there its a new ATH ride by Jan-Feb '18.

With regards to being above 10k, I'm pretty sure we may never see BTC close in 4 digits on the weekly candle ever again.

Heya I appreciate it coming from a 1 week redditor as most new accounts have shilling incentives. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:47
We when break support we are in a downtrend only till we break resistance again.
Those points have already changed to new reference point. From my memory I haven't witness BTC ever break a support price on the weekly chart.
Current resistance points to break an uptrend
* 1H = 15,635
* 4H = 16,630
* 1D =  -
* 1W = -
These points should come lower till be break them. Higher the frame stronger the trend.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:31:32
Here is everything you need to know.


In short the supply if Bitcoins the miners receive in the form of block reward (~ once every 10 min) will keep halving once every 4 years. The block reward started at 50BTC, then halved to 25 BTC (2012), 12.5 BTC (2016) and soon to be 6.25 BTC (2020)
Lesser BTC supply against an infinte Fiat supply will get us to Moon in time.
Sorry for the short ELI5. My eyes are bleeding ��

Heya no question is too stupid to ask (:
Each exchange have their own withdrawal fees so you'll have to check accordingly. 
 
Bitstamp for e.g has SEGWIT activated since Nov and the fees are drastically reduced. 
Most if not all exchanges will let you know the fees while withdrawing &amp; some may even let you set your own fee. 
To set your own fees go to  You can toggle the unit from sats/byte to mBTC or BTC.

If you would receive 10 XYZ for 1 ETH but ETH then depreciated by 10% while the market of XYZ remained constant, then XYZ would ask you for ~1.1 (+10%) ETH for their 10 XYZ.
IF XYZ fell by 20% against ETH which also fell by 10%, then you would pay ~ 0.9 ETH for 10 XYZ.

Why not post it publicly unless you want to share me your private keys ʘ‿ʘ. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:00:18
Yes you will. The best way to look at fees is in %.
Ideally keep your fees to 1 to 2% of your principle. You can withdraw accordingly. 
Also which are fees are you talking about? Depositing fiat fee, trading fee, withdrawing BTC fee etc
I could explain things better once you walk me through the fee you paid (fixed, % or fixed + %) on that $100.

If you are an ETH investor, then its up to you to manage your investment. 
If you brought ETH to trade it for more BTC sometime in the future then
* Cut losses short if your initial stop loss gets triggered.
* Use a trailing stop loss to take profits in Bitcoin or Fiat based on your unit of account.
Personally I only activate my trailing stop loss after the close of 3 candle from my entry.

@_date: 2017-12-01 12:53:18
Ever-growing population + an infinite M1 fiat system = Forever growing Bitcoin. 
When you first hodl bitcoin, you don't look for a price to sell, but for a way to slowly accumulate. 
When the price goes up you gain more fiat and when it goes down you buy more bitcoin. 
History has proven time and again, that the market price of bitcoin will be higher than your average buy in price. That's the time everyone feels they should have brought more or never sold. 


You generally liquidate mBTC for expenses that fiat can't buy or offer you a heavy discount. You sell to diversify and buy a house when it cost around 1 to 5 BTC, higher or lower depending on how long you're willing to delay gratification. 
In short liquidate only whats needed for personal expenses or other investments. 


There are two ways to approach them. 
Either buy them if you believe that the community won't dump and suppress the price under a certain bitcoin value. The other way is to trade them for more BTC. Buy low, sell high. When any community screems* that they are overtaking Bitcoin, its normally a good human sell indicator.


1) Register on BitMEX (find an affiliate link for fee discount or PM me for one).
2) Wait for the dip
3) Wait for a breakout to the upside.
4) Long BTC risking 2% of your trading balance at 2X leverage. 
5) Close trade at desired target profit 
6) **Do not short BTC. You will get rekt if you don't know what your doing.** Anyone who shorted at 6k, 8k and 9k were forced to go long and further bump up the price. Don't be greedy and stupid.
7) Repeat 2 to 5.
8) Profit and moon with Bitcoin.

Also make sure your principle is of relative value or that transfer is basically not worth it. Moving $10 and paying $5 (50% fee) is waaayyyy different than moving $500 and paying $5 (1% fee).
I don't think Bitstamp or Gemini for that matter have small limits* (if any) once you have got a verified account.

Just invest periodically using DCA, VCA or mBCA and enter the accumulation phase. From there get better at trading  and allocated 10% of your hodlings as your entire trading balance and never lose more than 1-2% of that trading balance on a single trade.

Here is the problem. Having an assumption on what others do.
Ever noticed that MEX has been the safest BTC exchange over time? You take the ugly side of system overload and trading against  the house which happens on most exhanges. 
Funny that you don't have an issue with sending coins FINEX considering their past history + USDT but would not use MEX even if they offer you a 0.025% rebate for limit orders @ 1x leverage.

My first HW purchase was Trezor which I gifted to a sibling while my 2nd purchase was a Ledger.
I personally havent had any form of contact with Trezor's community so my feedback wouldn't have any value.
For Ledger, during the Bcash split, they were way ahead of Trezor in releasing their upgrades. When it came to Bgold, it took some time to split those coins (my assumption being security + a buggy forked blockchain).
From those two events, my take is they prioritize the splitting of coins as long as security of your legacy coins aren't at risk.
When it comes to visual OPSEC, the ledger nano S can pass as corporate sponsored flashdrive while the TREZOR (basic model) stands out on its own. 
In the end, both fulfill their purpose and the rest is matter of perspective.

Yes. Say if an ATH of an ALT *ABC* is 0.01 BTC &amp; its fiat high is $200 (they can be two different price points).
A fib retracement of those numbers are 0.00618, 0.005, 0.00382 &amp; 0.00236 BTC respectively. On the fiat side its $123.6 $100, $76.4 &amp; $47.2.
The rate at which the USD value is violated to the upside is more often or not faster than the rate of BTC. Try it out with some Altcoins and you'll notice this correlation. 
So you can follow, buy &amp; hodl or trade any altcoin but don't forget to measure their unit of account in Bitcoin. If your losing BTC after purchasing an ALT it means that you've lost money.


Thats subjective but T.A should make you better at buying and selling altcoins. Each chartist have their own style and I rely primarily on support &amp; resistance. 
*Tip: By the laws of probability the risk of losing Bitcoin is greater when you buy an ALT at the higher fib retracement from its ATH (BTC value).*
Some Alts have an legitimate user case while most have a good story. If there is no direct use case for you then you only trade time and price. This makes it easier to identify entries and take profits when needed.


Can't recollect any specific video but here are a few channels I can vouch for.
* aantonop
* Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast
* Bitcoin TV
* Off Chain with Jimmy Song
* World Crypto Network
For Bitcoin Resources: 


Basically you will play the role of an investor, trader or both. 
As an investor you should measure the total USD spent and BTC received.  If you divide the total USD spent/BTC received you'll get your price per bitcoin (PPB) value. 
By investing periodically you are finding ways to quantify the unknown. If you put all your money in at the top in 2013 you wouldn't in a position to keep buying the dip and increasing your hodling (% of coins from 21 million). At the same time if you went all in at the dip ~$150 to $200, you would be on an island right now. Periodic investing will keep us in check from our emotions of fear and greed. There something known as Value  Cost Investing (VCA) or mBitcoin Cost Averaging (mBCA) which I use to stick to. mBCA is where you buy a fixed (or more at the dip) mBTC value periodically ireespective of its fiat value. You can readjust that value if needed when Bitcoin doubles.
As a trader, its all about entries, stops and taking profits. Time and price (not the stock or currency) is everything.


Oopsy daisy!!! I forget to make my pun obvious. Buying high and selling low is a direct result of fear and greed.


I was referring to the 'total USD spent' to buy  BTC &amp; ALTS and not ones absolute net worth. 
Never put more than 10% (15% at tops) of your family's net worth in crypto especially all at once. Your goal is for that fraction to challenge you total net worth in time. By this Risk:Reward ratio you stand you double you net worth in time or lose a tenth of it.


Congrats on the new job and may it take your career to new heights. 
Lets say you have €2k to invest every month, thats €500/week.
54 weeks x 500 = €27,000. Using DCA, VCA or mBCA try to buy &amp; hodl or buy, trade &amp; hodl coins that would eventually see its way on a hardware wallet.
In 4 years time if things go as planned you would have **saved up** €108,000 which has the potential to **be valued at** €500,000 or more.

**FUN FACT**
Bitcoin on average rises at least 160%* from every bottom &amp; 40% from its previous ATH over a span of 6 to 9 weeks.
* $20,093 x 1.4 = $28,130 ( New ATH)
* $28,130/2.6 = $10,819 (estimated bottom)
Now don't blindly buy (as a trader) at $10,819 but at least you know something that a weak hand may not.

Sure. In short you should never lose 1-2% on a single trade and at least have 12.5 losses for a 25 % drawdown.
If you are new to trading I suggest you don't use any leverage. 
Say if you have 1 BTC, you should open a contract worth 0.01 or 0.02 BTC. Amount is represented in USD so you'll need to place the dollar equivalent of 0.01 at 1X leverage on the dip/pullback/upside-breakout. You then close your position on your target profit or stop loss 
How you identify the dip is upto your understand and study of market. It all boils down to price correlation on different timeframes, identifying up and down trends with their valid breakouts, having ideal stop losses and figuring out a way to calculate your target profit. Read 'TD Lines' to have a better understanding of trading trendlines. 
Try to not over size your position or leverage because you'll be forced to close your order even when you eventually right. 
Practice on  to get a hang of the website and then trade with real BTC. GL

It is called converting unrealized P&amp;L to realized P&amp;L.


These people are hodlers/DCA-investors/non-traders who do themselves way more damage by trading. Have you thought of that!?
 
An edge in markets isn't static &amp; can even be found in many places.
When you are down you have lost your money and all you can do is hope it comes back. When you are up, the ball is in your court.
Not really. A skilled investor/trader maintains control over purchases irrespective if they're up or down.

Great job! Increasing your bitcoin stash via trading is one way to bring down your average entry price.
It goes without saying that if you lose BTC while trading then it increase you avg entry price. 
Take it easy and use sound risk management for posiiton sizing. 
Alternatively DCA is another way to go. With this average entry price stays within a range from the market price.

As long as spending is pegged to a fiat value (unless mass adoption where most things are brought in Satoshis), I don't see how that would discourage people.

It matters on the base currency. ETH weakens, you'll be paying more for Alt XYZ and the same would be true for BTC.
Also the order book would be thinner on the ETH pairs due to lesser liquidity so getting filled may be an issue.
Lastly you won't get to trade all Alts with ETH as compared to BTC.
Some pairs like ETC/ETH have a reasonable correlation so they can use useful to trade with ETH.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:35:58
Since your just starting off, I'd advice you to look into Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) or Bitcoin Cost Averaging (BCA).
Also start getting use to valuing your wealth in Bitcoin so wouldn't get too excited or dejected in the short term when the price moves either way.

If you kill bitcoin, you kill crypto. Most altcoin traders exhibit extreme emotion of either gaining or losing more bitcoin. 
If ETH ever went to +1 BTC what would the market do? You know why it hasn't gone there? Becuase of those imaginary infinte sell walls at 0.99, 0.98, 0.76, 0.3....
So why do every other altcoin pump from time to time. The same reason we have infinite imaginary buy walls at 0.0000001, 0.0000003 and so on.
From a market perspective, altcoins are another illusion of bitcoin itself. Look at it as a crypto fractional reserve system of 21 million bitcoins.
Party A &amp; B swap BTC &amp; ALTS with a common goal to get more bitcoin/fiat. This is good for bitcoin (at the cost either A or B)  because it prevent capital from sitting in fiat. At the same time a bullish bitcoin should keep the alts fiat value high provided there isn't a sell off which increases its supply pressure. 
For me, trading time and price of highly liquidable coins while using bitcoin (not fiat) as a unit of account has served me well.

1/10000 because other coins are valued in bitcoin so psychologically traders value their altcoin positions in btc and sell off when the times right.
Fib retracements will show you how far alts are in relation to bitcoin despite making new ATHs.
Technically an Alt valued once at $200 (0.2 BTC) was more valuable than its new ATH at $400 (0.15 BTC).
What's worse their fiat value crashes faster and recover slower than bitcoin when capital moves in and out of crypto.

INR isn't very portable so they may be limits in doing so. Maybe an NRI account that hodls foreign currency (USD) could be used but you still need to find an int exchange that accepts funds from an Indian bank.

Give it few days and things should work out fine. Henceforth use 10X leverage and deposit 1/10th of your trading balance on an exchange (BitMEX, Bitfinex) that lets you trade on margin. If done right, they work out to one and the same thing but with 10 times less counterparty risk. GL

You don't get the long and short game. Eventually shorts will get rekt as Bitcoin distribution is decentralised and limited in supply. 
Logically speaking the volume of Bitcoin (not its valuation) on the ask wall will dry up as time passes and the bid wall would flatten out over time. 
No one thought we could reach 10k from 1k within a year. So why not give our economy some leverage to hit $100k by 2020 to 2028.
My parents brought their house for 1/12th the price I would need to accumulate to purchase that. Let's not forget that purchase power of fiat was stronger during their time to mine. Their grandparents maybe would have had to pay 1/144th for a house during their time.

[[Bitcoin-segwit2x] Segwit2x Final Steps](


blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.


strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.


obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.


whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

I guess now's the perfect time to pass some time writing one. All you need to do is take time off and head to the drawing room.
For me recording my own trades was getting in the way, so I now sum them up on a weekly basis (54). I set a reasonable (but by no means easy) target and get close as the weeks comes. 
From 10 BTC, you can use 10X leverage for a 1 BTC position (0.1 margin) and add on to it only if facing liquidation. Fear and greed should be no reason to bloat up your position size to slightly decrease your entry price. 0.1 x 54 = 5.4BTC/yr &amp; 0.2 x 54 = 10.8BTC/yr. Don't follow your balance and make those weekly 0.1 or 0.2 withdrawals. 
Don't waste time on shit coins. You can get the same result (more btc) by going long or short bitcoin (its better the long a position and close it short than the other way round).
Once you get past and move on from this mistake (all traders do), play a one year marathon and don't let fear or greed push you from your objective. GL.

1) Be a whale
2) Find a exchange with no fees and make a deal with them (backroom).
3) Wash trade your shitcoin and project your fake moon to the world.
4) Retail ~~trade~~ traders* take the bait and start to buy up the order book on their exchanges. 
5) That same whale (group) will start to sell into those buy order and leave their followers unsighted to hodl onto the peak in misery while they trigger a bloodbath.
Do you genuinely believe a SoV crypto will lose 50% of its value in a 30min/1hr candle?
If thats the case BCH can be $1m at the 15:00 and $0.5m by 16:00. Sorry but that market is extremely gamed and any outsider should not participate with no inside information. 
6) Profit.
**Edit:** Putting yourself in a 30min do or die position for a 50% SoV correction to the down side is the **true financial meaning of network congestion.**

Use DCA and buy in once every week. You'll protect your from any downward volatility and gain on the upside.
Keep track of your average buying price and take advantage to bring it down when the market dips below it.
Bitcoin is so sound that you only need to liquidate it for a personal expenses or investment and let your balance coins gain in value.

Fallacies of Bart Jellema theory
* Companies and miners can easily influence users and tickers. 
* 85% hash rate slogan 
* Slow blocks will make Bitcoin worth ~$200.
* Bitcoin.com pool alert for mining on B2X
* Taking a gamble on astrotuf information.
* Believed B2X wasn't an Altcoin as it was an upgrade w/o replay protection. 
* Crypto Futures markets are true price discoveries 
* Believed B2X had community consensus. 
* Voted for his money in favor of bad actors despite a genuine  movement
But honestly, I hope he has 10X of 85k so he can move past this horrible judgement &amp; sleep in peace. So is life in speculative markets because he would be feasting on the wounds of BTC hodlers had B2X pumped.
I'm sure those infamous 6 would have made more than 200X his loss

You should only expose a max of 1% liquidation/trade. 
With a balance of 21, 1% risk of capital liquidation is 0.21BTC/trade irrespective of the leverage you use.
Either way taking a break be good for now. I reckon you could get to 15 and from there to 21 over a slow and steady path. GL

As per my weekly chart, I wouldn't like BTC to fall below 4.4k cause that force may pull eventually pull us down to 1.5k
Having said that, this correction to me would be in the range of 4 5 to 5.5k. If things go as they have, we'll bounce up to 10k by Feb '18.

You misunderstand the SoV meaning here. Draw a Fibonacci retracement of BTC/USD, ALTS/USD &amp; ALTS/BTC. 
You'll be surprised how often ALTS/BTC fall +70% from their ATH and struggle to constantly hodl their highs against BTC. 
If Bitcoins blockchain had been hacked like Ethereum, this market wouldn't have the confidence to sustain such levels of capital.
Which coin would drain the market if every crypto announced a HF in a weeks time with coins both chains? 
In my view ALTS are essential for creating fiction and cutting off money sitting in fiat for most of the year. What's not good for them is everyone's unit of account in cypto is BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:04:10


You can tweak this to your preference. 
Say Bitcoin was at $10k and you planned to buy $100 worth of it every week.
For the 1st week, you received 0.01 BTC (10 mBTC) for your $100. Week two, BTC went to $9k and you received 11.11 mBTC. By week three it went to $11k and here you can either put in $100 for 9.09 mBTC or $110 for 10mBTC.
By opting to go for the latter, your phase of accumulating 10mBTC or more wouldn't be pulled back during bull runs. At the same time you can always put in $150 at $9k for 16.16 mBTC and being down your averaging price. This $150 would grow to $183.33 at $11k so the $110 buy-in shouldn't hurt you at all.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:53:33
Just remember that liquidation = leverage x draw-down. 
So if you took 10X leverage, your entire position would get liquidated at 10% (100/10X) and  for 2X leverage at 50%. Your free to adjust the leverage anytime you will and add another position to extend liquidity. 
For basic position sizing, if your trading balance is 1000 units and risk per trade is 10 (1%), you would place a position of 100 at 10X leverage and your liability for that trade would be 10. This is similar to having an open position of 100 units with a 10% stop where you leave the trade with a 10 unit (1%) loss. 
Edit: You can practice on

Agreed. Currencies and countries toggle on every IP location change. It is still misleading to use the word buy for every IP country especially since Luno is operating in just 5 for now.

On the contrary, regulated fiat exchanges should thrive on transparency. Here is what    etc look like.

A minimum of $10,000 so 1 mBTC is traded at $10 and Bits are traded in pennies. Realistically, exchanges should already be giving us the option to toggle between mBTC &amp; BTC.

Well said there. Patience teaches us that it doesn't matter if Bitcoin goes up 200X in a week because it would be stupid to blow it all up anyway or if it goes  down 50X becuase we probably don't need to utilize our SoV at that time anyway .
If we look at the passing of our soul, it has way more value to the bitcoin rather than fiat economy. 
If you die in debt, its mostly just piled on as a liability to the fiat economy where as with bitcoin you either provide support (in price)  to the future generation or pass it on to a credible person and hope it changes their life for the better.
Another reason why Bitcoin now won't drop by 80-90% (except for a blockchain breakdown) is because the majority of people who intend to short it do so to gain more bitcoin. Then there is a herd of people who need bitcoin as an intraday mode of payment and will obtain it at any price. Its a must for fiat to enter the bitcoin economy but it isn't a must when its the other way round.
I believe we are entering an era of financial freedom and responsibility with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-23 07:11:07
The right advice would be to invest periodically and keep a track of your average buying rate. When opportunity presents itself, load up some more coins to drop that average buy rate.
If you started and $3000 and kept on going till today, your average buy rate would be around ~$4200.
You would rate have 5 BTC at $4200 than 1 BTC at $3000.
At the current rate of ~$6000, those 5 BTC would return back $9000 @ ROI of 42.9% while 1 BTC would give you a profit of $3000 @ ROI of 100%.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:39:38

I have nothing against alts but most of their general concept is to trade them to earn more bitcoin. 
If you look at the dollar and bitcoin all time high value of the top alts, they all lost a significant value in terms of bitcoin while preserving somewhat of a decent value in terms of dollar (as bitcoin supports their higher dollar value).
On the other side of things, they help maintain the bitcoin &amp; crypto ecosystem. Cash doesn't always flow out to USD &amp; an overweighted bitcoin gets temporarily cooled off into alts thus maintaining the equilibrium of balance.

That's not now it works. Brokers will list their buy and sell spread based on their market order for their maximum transaction.

Use DCA and bring your average buying price lower than $4.6k. It's way better than increasing your average cost when you buy again once it crosses above $4.6k.

Dollar Cost Averaging i.e you spend a fixed dollar amount to buy BTC on a regular basis.

@_date: 2017-10-23 07:24:08
Haha that's my target as well. 1 House = 1 BTC.
But Bitcoin will never be worth less. Think of it in this way. 


$6000 = 0.1 BTC (bullish)
$6000 = 1 BTC (neutral)
$600 = 10 BTC (bearish)
$60 = 100 BTC (bearish)
$6 = 1000 BTC (bearish)
$0.6 = 10000 BTC (bearish)
You see, in 10 years time my 1 BTC should be $60,000 or 10,000 BTC would be $6000. 
Overlooking precise timing, at the end of the day, I'll always be HODLing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:01:39

My only advice is don't get shaken out of your bitcoin by a tempted fiat valuation.

This correlation is no different than how an appreciating real estate is valued against a devaluing fiat.

You need to Identify how you made and lost money while trading during this run. 
As long as you have an advantage to determine your entry, target and stop with accurate position sizing, don't stop trading.
If you haven't found it already, don't began trading.
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:23:29
I would prefer to sell my BTC to a hodler than to an institute who would liquidate it to fiat for the seller.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:42:27
If I had an option to liquidate my BTC for an asset to someone who is a part of the economy rather than someone who just wants fiat, I would chose the prior. That's again if I had an option to chose between the two 
The art of hodling doesn't mean you don't necessarily spend Bitcoin. I'm more than happy if a service provider accepts BTC. What's important is if a hodler then knows how to replace those spent coins or come to peace with it.
Hodling Bitcoin can also be synonymous to another form of wealth one stores that doesn't need to be utilized anytime soon.

I feel the working class invest in real estate because they believe it to be a stable store of value. The downside of this is you can't liquidate a tile for an expense or investment. The same can be said with Gold.
Bitcoin changes everything as it is easily divisible and highly liquid. I see it as a house (store of value) that consistently gains value without the influence of geographical politics and at the same time provides an opputunity to cover ones expenses (currency) from its gains which is somewhat similar to the concept of printing money.
So in my view, as long as the rate of adoption backed by population growth is great than the average weighted liability (need to liquidate) of HODLers, it is safe to assume that Bitcoin will forever keep on hitting new all time highs.
P.S: One of the success of Bitcoin is the ability of our community to support a new buyers entry point irrespective of its government issued fiat valuation ʘ‿ʘ

To each his own. But let me leave you with this. 
The death of Bitcoin will be the dealth of Cryptocurrencies on the whole as a store of value.
Why? Because if its ABC coin in the future, then it can be XYZ coin some other time followed by LMNO coin. This defeats the whole purpose of the symbolic meaning of having a gold standard.
Bitcoin will and forever have the strongest of HODLers who have adopted an exit sell strategy called '6 feet under.'
Alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin are great for technical and speculative trading but don't get fooled by those who'll dump their Alts for Bitcoin in a jiffy when they reach their desired gain. They are good for competitiveness over pure monopoly. 
BTC HODLers on the other hand understood this simple fundamental where as long as government issued fiat currency has an infinite supply and the population of people keep on growing, the probability of a surge is greater to that of a decline. Also we'll enter a phase where one could buy real estate and other assest easily with Bitcoin so thats something to look forward to.
P.S: 4 months ago, [Long-term HODLers be like](

Bitcoin is as liquid as major fiat currencies, so it's value is here to stay.
Coins can always be brought in lower decimals so we'll always find people willing to buy it in lower denominations. After all its quite possible for a millibit to cross $10 and beyond.

I spend my government issued fiat currency on the economy and store my wealth in Bitcoin. 
HODLing BTC increases my purchasing power and the idea of selling/splurging my gains is inversely proportional to that.
Selling BTC to HODL fiat is a big no no when you grasp the bigger picture.
Last but no the least, by me HODLing provides support to new adopters especially  those who come from hyper inflated currencies. 
HODLing thus not only helps you but also those who face economic constrains which in turn would liberate everyone from poverty.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:46:28
I have my small but content net worth all invested in Bitcoin as well so we're pretty much on the same boat who are backed by countless other HODLers.
You can always recommend a Bitcoin Insurance Target (BIT).
BIT = [(Your Wealth/Global Wealth) x Total Bitcoin Supply]
BIT = [($X/$250 Trillion) x 21 Million]
e.g. [($25000/$250 Trillion) x 21 Million] = 0.0021 BIT.
I know it may look small but thats what an insurance is suppose to be. From there on its up to an individual to scale up using sound investing techniques.

Thanks mate and I'm sure you'll overcome those concerns in time. These are a few tips on how I slowly but surely grew my Bitcoin stash irrespective of its volatility and price.


If I would ever invest in ETH &amp; BTC simultaneous, I would do it based on the ratio of Bitcoins market cap is to Ethereums market cap.
Their current ratio is 2.45 is to 1. That is $2.45 BTC for every $1 ETH.

Will Bitcoin not be backed by POW @ 1971?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:50:32
The point OP is making is stability with constant growth. Would you play a 10 year hodling game of BTC vs DASH? Also would new adopters play an ATH hodlings game of BTC vs ALTCOINS?
Alts are great for technical and speculative analysis to increase your BTC stash if you time or play the market well.
The core fundamental of Bitcoin is to elevate the world from economic instability as its backed by HODLers who's exit strategy is death.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:10:04
Sorry for your loss but here's how you goofed up.
1. Never go all in while investing. 
2. You should have planned and stored $ in case of an emergency. 
3. Every investment has a wait period with a potential up or downside attached to it.
4. Should have read EBay's TOS before transacting or contacted them to ensure you'll be protected in case of fraud.
5. Released funds only after you verify the credentials of your buyer and cross checking it with EBay to check for any red flags.
6. Should have had a verified exchange account to liquidate your BTC to $.
TLDR: Don't fly a plane before your a certified pilot. If not, the crash would be inevitable. 
Edit: We all have take unwanted hits from time to time. I know it sucks but time heals everything and life moves on.
The future is bright and you'll have way more  opportunities where this loss wouldn't mean anything. Good luck dude.

Another option if you have fiat funds is to reinvest fiat to bitcoin and balance those deficit Bitcoins.
Note down those losses in fiat and wait for a time when STR grows to recover your fiat and leave the balance change if any in bitcoin.
Even if STR is stuck for a couple of year there's a good enough chance for btc to double which would wipe off your fiat loss.

Psychology plays a bigger role when it comes to making a financial decision.
Let's take an example of three different gold investors. Each of them purchased 21 units of ~~godl~~ gold at different timelines. 
The first adopters brought 21 units where each unit represented a pound (453.592 grams). The second one got in when the universal unit was scaled down from a pound to an ounce (28.35 grams) while the third got in when the an ounce was further scaled down to a tola (10 grams).
All the rest felt like they missed the train and promised to buy cheaper units of gold when the universal unit was further brought down to a gram. 
In the end every line of adopters held 21 units but each used a different scale of measurement. 
Now replace 21 units of gold (pound, ounce, tola, gram) with 21 units of Bitcoin (BTC, mBTC, uBTC and Satoshi) and you'll be pleased to be presented with an opportunity today rather than been given another chance in the future.

It maybe insane in a shorter frame time but not so on the bigger scale of things.
At mass adoption,
$0.2 trillion/year = 105 years
$0.5 trillion/year = 42 years
$1.0 trillion/year = 21 years
Lets not forget common people had no idea of real estate value some 600 years ago.
Also as government deficits keep increasing, there would be more and more money in circulation. 
When you compare an inflating uncontrolled supply (fiat) against a deflationary limited supply (bitcoin), you'll start to notice why you'll never need to sell.

I believe most of them are out of stock (period). Trezor &amp; Ledger are currently the most reputed ones.

Let me rephrase that. Crypt0 jumps to cover any possible news and new alts without verifying their credentials. He did make AMP sound like the next big thing when it was basically just a rebranded pumping scheme. 
On video he seems like a decent block, but that doesn't mean I'd subscribe or follow any of his 'next big thing' announcement. 
Everyone here should be vigilant of manipulation that happens in this space. 
95% of trades only buy alts to flip them for more BTC so one shouldn't be ignorant and baghold a falling knive.

No it isn't as easy as you make it seem. Had you brought in at 2300€ and panic sodl at 1730€ you would have lost 600€ within a week time.
Having said that, understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and you probably would never to sell unless you master the art of shorting (selling high to buy back cheap) Bitcoin. 
P.S1: Shorting isn't everyone's cut of tea and you would rather prefer to Hodl your coins.
P.S2: You should mainly be concerned with the volume of coins you HODL and your fiat valuation will take care of itself. 
P.S3: If you panic when there's a correction means you've not followed basic buy in strategics such as Dollar Cost Averaging or Bitcoin Cost Averaging.

3 month account with 25 karma. All your post history indicates that you are paid to post jump and spam this sub.

@_date: 2017-06-12 13:17:10
I couldn't agree more. 9/10th of tokens and ICOs are a ponzi.
Do people get rich on a ponzi? Yes! Do people get burned on a ponzi? Yes!
r/btc brainwash users new to this space by masking **spam** with **censored** while pumping ETH for their vested own interest. 
It's very easy to* fool yourself when you feel there's a possibility of being censored. Well I did for a brief span only to realise all they do is whine all the time and take about how X coin will take over Bitcoin followed by how Y coin will take over Bitcoin.
They have absolutely no interest in the store value and scaling of Bitcoin. The FUD talk that goes on there is unbelievable. If Core was so evil Greg wouldn't have pointed out vulnerabilities in BU code.
The rest who want a hard fork believe that doubling their coins will double their wealth.
ETH inflates on a timely basis and you need more money pumping in to sustain your % share in that economy. So does Fiat. BTC doesn't!!!
Edit: Typo*

Yeahh! Where's my degree mate ;)

Considering its both parties fault, the only fair thing to do is what Bitfinex did.
If you lost $1000 worth 1 BTC, you should repay them $1000 worth X BTC (1000/Current Market Price).
Also pay them X amount per month based on a mutual agreement. The amount they receive could either be in fiat or bitcoin. 
Had it been the other way round, not many would be so generous.

Lesser miners would lessen the mining difficulty rate which in turn would create a new influx of miners.

Value cost averaging maybe better than DCA.

Unless you have something substantial to say that gives a better understanding of your concern and a way to solve it, this post in my view is spreading
which helps to serve your vested interest, whatever that may be.
**Edit**: 
2 year old account with -7 karma is clearly a sign that you brought this account for peanuts only to get paid back in peanuts for shit posting on this sub. Grow up dude!

Look at the fundamentals, the current and future use case of bitcoin and you'll know for yourself. 
As per how to invest, try Dollar Cost Averaging or BTC/mBTC Cost Averaging to protect you from volatility while growing your Bitcoin stash at the same time.
HODL Bitcoin and only trade 1% of your entire balance once your well educated on trading. If you do decide to trade, never leave more than 10% of your hodlings on an exchange. 
Good luck.

This is a very reasonable buy in strategy. If OP is still confused, he can always revert back to this,
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:28:54
You are suppose to double invest whenever you feel the need to spend.
Spend fiat, balance it by hedging into Bitcoin
If you get a good deal for BTC, spend those coins and make a plan to buy them back in a set period of time.

I salute each and every hodler for the support the give to another brother. Brothers comes from all shape and sizes, all colours and religions.
We hodl not only because of the infinite possible solutions Satoshi handed over to us but also because we can contribute towards the elevation of another fellow adopters.
We never sodl because we can't move back into an uncapped economy. We trade because we believe it's an organic way to grow our hodlings but we never shat on our Godfather who brought us this decentralized economy. 
Days are approaching closer when governments encourage companies to accept BTC so they can grow their own GDP.
The very fact that governments have started to open their arms is because you can't stop something that is unstoppable and they can't trust a banking viper anymore who prints for himself.
Bitcoin is a decentralized economy with a capped supply enough for everyone to elevate themselves from poverty. 
Polls can be rigged but the % share of Bitcoin you hodl in this economy will never depreciate. 
Be a part of this change and the future will be grateful our actions. 
My exit strategy is having faith that my inheritant will carry on this belief. 
Bitcoin doesn't need us but our civilization desperately needs it to bridge the gap better the poor and rich. 
I may hodl little but every Satoshi I hodl will make the inhabitants of this planet a better place.
Again, I cannot be more grateful to all you hodlers out there ♱♡‿♡♰
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:32:09
Never leave all your coins on any exchange and hodl them on a hardware wallet.
If you feel the need to day/swing trade, move only 5 to 10% of your hodlings.

Look at OPs account history. Had a couple of soccer post 2 years ago. He then resurrects a week ago only to start shit posting here. 
Now you tell, would you put your money to back OP as a legit user? Reason would say he purchased it to be a paid troll.
It's ok to share different opinions but spamming only to be blocked, followed by crying under the tagline of censorship is pure evil and manipulative.

Nah I HODL and short term price movements have little to no effect on me.
