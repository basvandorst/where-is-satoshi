Hodl all the way, friend!

Using your CPU should be no problem. You could either not tell anyone and it won't matter, or be a bit more careful and ask around (but they might say no in which case don't mine).
If you're looking to make money, I doubt you'll make much at all, since CPU mining is extremely inefficient and slow due to the high difficulty number (and since you're competing with extremely powerful ASICs).
If you're going to stick an ASIC (like an Antminer or something), it would be a terrible idea to do it without permission, because of the incredibly large amount of energy it takes in and the noise/heat is generates. The likeliness of this being possible with permission is quite unlikely imo

I greatly considered this recently while contemplating whether I should get an Antminer S9, but I decided against it in the end because if I were to invest money into Bitcoin again, it wouldn't be for mining equipment. I would be better off buying some BTC than getting a miner. I made that decision when BTC was just $7k and, in hindsight, I would've it so badly if I did go through and pull the trigger on the S9.

Right on with that prediction, man! I'm hodling all the way and I don't plan on spending any of it in the near future. 
Also, just because you might not necessarily have the financial means to get invested doesn't mean you can't do research into BTC. Personally, I think that it'd be worth spending some time looking into it; I believe crypto will become a very prevalent thing in the next few years (looking at the exponential growth and all the media coverage recently) so it wouldn't hurt to have some knowledge.
If you get a deeper insight into BTC, perhaps you might even consider it as a viable investment. Though BTC's value is at an ATH at the time of writing this (~$19.5k), professionals talk about BTC's potential to reach anything up to $40k at the end of next year. If you're genuinely interested and prepared to embark on a rocky ride then you could shell out a hundred dollars or so as a long-term investment. I describe it as a rollercoaster since BTC's volatility can be jarring – especially when it dips a couple thousand (though it always recovers) – so it does take a certain degree of balls XD
Anyways, hope you got *something* out of that (I'm not known to be the most concise person ever). Have an awesome day :D

Could very well be because of my activities, but the change is not large enough to seem like it is...
Not so sure about inflation; we don't use the USD here so I can only assume it's the landlords raising the price slightly for the hell of it
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:56:04
Much appreciation :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:48:51
Yeah I'm opting to hodl all the way! Bitcoin and crypto to a degree has been a sort of passion as it is a hobby for me. Thank you so much for the kind words!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:40:18
A lower transaction fee would take the bitcoin longer to confirm. I think OP is talking about additional fees imposed by a third party, which differ depending on the service 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:07:02
Heck, man. Kinda at a loss for words. Thanks and have an amazing day!
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:20:51
I honestly believe, with the correct steps taken, that Bitcoin could become mainstream sometime down the road. Most of my friends know about Bitcoin but – as far as I'm aware – none have any. Some have considered it, though.
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:29:57
Yeah, I originally created this account for posting on subs for gaming and stuff (hence my cringy username) but never really got round to posting with it.
I'll take that 'college-educated adult' as a compliment. As for me being interested in BTC at such a young age? I think the fact that I could use it to buy games and stuff without having to ask my parents everytime was a factor that motivated me to do more looking into the matter (I dunno lol, what'ya expect from 11 year old me?)
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:19:58
Thanks for the reassurances, the sense of regret is fading away as I'm still grateful for the wonderful opportunity that I was presented with. 
As for 2x, it's really a mixed bag for me. I don't have a terribly deep understanding of it, but so far I've gleaned that one of its main aims is to increase the block size to 2MB which, in itself, leads to a plethora of different things. As of right now, I don't really have a solidified opinion on it – probably because my understanding of it is limited – but also because I still weighing the benefits of lower transaction fees and shorter confirmation waits and the adverse effects that would mean for me as a miner. I'm looking into it
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:13:02
Yeah I entertained the idea for a bit, however, I didn't go through with it because the heatsinks on each of the hashing boards are very difficult and risky to remove and I didn't want to risk breaking everything
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:15:55
The bill for the electricity at the office? Yes. Whether it is paid by the kilowatt (unlikely because the energy consumption ticker only shows the consumption for that floor and not individual offices) or as a flat rate, it is not something that I would have to worry about. Even if I did I could pay it off without a deficit.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:25:39
Yeah, I agree. The possibility of having a wallet that can store non-tangible funds was a key incentive that pushed me to go ahead with my Bitcoin mining.
The high fees and the strenuous wait to confirm a transaction is why so many people and large corporations support the whole 2x deal going on. Of course, as a miner, it would mean I'd be losing something as well as gaining.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:30:21
Hodl. 
Professional analysts and people in financing predict bitcoin will continue to soar at an exponential rate.
Be prepared for various dips – including one that may follow reaching 10k – but **do not panic sell**. Bitcoin is infamous for large dips and its price volatility but it has always recovered and is rising overall. Take a couple weeks ago when it drop to $5.8k. 2 weeks later and it rose nearly 4.2k. Gl
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:43:32
Much obliged. It's been quite the odyssey and I treasure the problem solving and the experiences it has allowed me to go through despite maybe not getting as much financial gain
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:04:32
Nice man. It’s always fun seeing people around my age getting into bitcoin as well. Have you ever asked your parents about getting a bitcoin miner? It’s a great way to learn about bitcoin and modern technology as I have, though it’s not the best as an investment, it’s still satisfying getting just that little bit of money. Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:49:07
My mum's office is one room of many on a floor of similar rooms and the electrical box containing the energy consumption is for the total of the all the offices, there's no individual reading for her office. Even if the bill was to be shared evenly across all the offices (since they have no way of determining which one was using an abnormal amount of energy) it wouldn't be enough to hurt profits. 
EDIT: just double-checked with the Mum herself, it's paid as a flat rate and – so far this year – has only increased by about $1.5 from before. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:59:30
Agreed. I wouldn't want more heartbreak if I were to cash out now and watch the value of BTC go to five figures or more.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:09:38
Cheers! And yeah, I have massive respect for them for being so accepting of this completely new thing
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:31:46
Too true... Still kinda regret not buying more when I did, though I never expected Bitcoin to rise as high as it did
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:36:45
Mining right now is not the way to go. Admittedly, I'm mining myself but only because I do not have to pay electricity. Using ASICs is a wonderful way to consume electricity and in many cases, it would result in a net loss. One of the most power efficient miners on the market right now (Antminer S9) still takes in a humungous amount of energy, not to mention the price tag of $1400 (not accounting for the power supply it requires) and the noise (sounds like a vacuum cleaner, if not worse). 
As mentioned previously, cloud mining is a horrendous idea. Please don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:06:57
Thanks, admittedly I didn't have that many friends back then so I could afford to spend some time digging deep into this little hobby of mine
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:38:50
Thanks for the insight, I never really thought about that
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:01:10
I must say, though, there was a lot of luck involved; things wouldn't be near what it's like now if I'd come across Bitcoin a year later than I did. Anyways, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:03:56
30k? Holy crap that's amazing. Must be quite the setup. Sounds like you're running quite the fantastic operation over there. 
Also, do you think it's that necessary to have a hardware wallet, or will my current wallet on Blockchain.info suffice for now?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:22:32
If your coworker is saying you can't buy bitcoin simply because you're Mexican, I'm afraid he's a racist scumbag. Use of bitcoin is not something regulated by race. Whether you're situated in Mexico or the US, bitcoin is perfectly legal
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:37:53
Thanks a ton! I'm really grateful for my parents and their willingness to support me every step in my endeavour.
I appreciate the little warning, I think my heart will flutter and shrivel a bit no matter how much I mentally prepare for it but I'm still going to follow the advice of the folks here and hodl strong :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:03:17
Oh no, I've been found out XD
I don't know how I can convince y'all otherwise so I guess you'll just have to take my word that I am indeed 14
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:44:11
Yeah, they were skeptical at first because of all the shady stuff but they're "business people" and I convinced them of the potential profits so they approved an investment and have been supportive since
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:34
As a fellow 14 year old who has had success with bitcoin, try convincing your parents that it's a worthwhile investment. As mentioned before, $80 isn't a lot so if you could get your parents to see the potential profits investing a bit more that would be excellent. Read up about it. Look at analysts' opinions and use them as evidence and a basis to convince your parents. 
Bitcoin is an amazing thing both as an idea and an investment (just look at the exponential growth this past year!), get your parents to see what bitcoin is. Many people reject the cryptocurrency because they don't know all that much about it. Let them understand. Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:24:16
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:03:03
Many thanks, I dont think all the posts are that bad though :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:57:49
Haha, a pickup and a sound system must've been pretty sick and I assume you had a good time so that's mostly what matters. As of right now, I have no clue what I'd spend the majority of my profits on. I've spent small amounts of Bitcoin on games and whatnot but nothing astronomical... yet :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:58
Bitcoin is a currency that you can send and receive just like any other, the only difference being it's decentralised, transparent and accessible from all over.
It's not a pyramid scheme because it's the overall value of the currency increasing due to a tremendous popularity in blockchain technology and in the idea of a decentralised currency, not the result of a pyramid scheme where older investors get paid by new investors. 
They're two completely different things; bitcoin is a currency, a pyramid scheme is an investment model.
Though it should be mentioned that he may not be entirely wrong about losing all your money. If a large exchange gets brought down (like Mt. Gox all those years ago) then the price would plummet but even then you wouldn't lose everything – not to mention the fact that, with time, it would most likely recover.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:48:28
I'll strive to do so :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:15:31
Thank you for the encouraging words! I've talked about my involvement with Bitcoin with various friends and some of them do appear interested, especially with the profits. 
Starting a blog or something of the sort is certainly possible, but I'm unsure about its feasibility because of all the school work I'm getting right now. I'll consider it though, thanks again!
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:32:46
Haha, I can only hope! Thanks for taking time out of your day with my post!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:59:11
In theory, it would be a very good investment. In my case, it was nowhere as profitable as buying at that price and hodl'ing. Currently, with Bitcoin rising so quickly, buying is most likely the better choice but is riskier. Mining is safer but less profitable, at least in my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:22:38
Appreciate it! I've learned not to dwell on things that could've been; hurts too much 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:09:14
This account is a year old, I made it when I was 13. Not a large difference though so yeah XD
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:14:36
Well, think about it this way: if you made money from every opportunity presented to you then you'd be the richest person in the world, ya gotta cut corners
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:10:45
I'm humbled, thank you so much. Best of luck to you as well, kind sir!
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:47:30
Hodling's the way to go :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:53:21
I won't lie, I believed Bitcoin would be a good way to circumvent my parents' (surprisingly) strict rules on online purchases for games especially, which was a motivating factor. Over the years, I have spent small amounts of my Bitcoin purchasing several games and CSGO skins but I've realised Bitcoin is much bigger than what I thought it was.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:31:45


True dat
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:30:58
Feelsbadman 'cause it's true :/
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:19
Not worth. $80 isn't getting you anything near worthwhile. Not only is it too little to get an ASIC powerful and efficient enough to get you a positive output (power consumption is one heck of a deal breaker), it's not even enough to get a solid GPU
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:45:07
Haha, yeah they are. Thank you for taking your time to read and comment!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:12:52
I currently have all my BTC in the Blockchain wallet. It's user-friendly and I've been using it throughout my entire time with bitcoin without any hiccups. 
However, the passcode is (as far as I'm aware, anybody correct me if I'm wrong) limited to 4 digits or a Touch ID since I'm using an iPhone; the customisability of the password is not excellent, but a great wallet overall
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:04:15
Haha thank you, I as well share you're hatred for people who cant use apostrophes correctly. Its awfully frustrating (sorry XD)
Joking aside, I really appreciate your kind words!
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:16:21
Many thanks, mining was supposed to be quite profitable back then but with the difficulty so high you're so much better off just buying and hodl'ing
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:32:54
Thank you, sir, for the kind words! I really do hope to continue upholding my interest in Bitcoin and to watch it grow
