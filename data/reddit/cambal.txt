This entire subreddit has just turned into a massive ELI5 for me.

Too complicated I'd rather just buy Bitcoin from a trusted exchange like Kraken and hold them there.

I thought the whole point of Bitcoin is that there are no fees?

I thought the ad said Magic the Gathering money until now

So eventually it will confirm I haven't done anything wrong on that part? I thought the recommended blockchain fee was enough that I didn't need to tinker with it.  
Here is the transaction on blockchain

What does it even mean?

This is all way confusing for me I read the sticky article about low fees and I'm still lost, I need someone to tell me am I fucked? I can't order a new plane ticket because this one still could go through

No, I ain't having none of that crypting to some dodgy USB blockchain wallet. For me safest and easiest way to store bitcoins is on the exchange.

Thank you kind stranger, the transaction is confirmed as of now. I already panicked last night and submitted a fee of 2 USD for the Child pays Parent but I guess even that was too low since there was no action.

So much for the instant transactions and low fees. Now this shit charging more than the banks.

I'd rather keep them at a trusted exchange than cycle them through different wallets paying  transaction fees to miners.
