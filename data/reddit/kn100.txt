Hey again, I got the batteries from Fasttech (If it says Authentic, 99 times out of 100 it is authentic) and the charger from Fasttech. I'm using the Nitecore UM10 charger at the moment but I am wishing I'd bought the UM20 or even a four slot.

Probably never going to see this but I just wanted to thank you guys for being so open about all of this. Yes, you guys messed up, and now we are going to pay the price for it, but there isn't an exchange on earth that could claim to be totally hack proof. At least you guys had the decency to keep everybody in the loop and at least attempt to compensate losses. Its probably depressing seeing so much negativity about all of this, but frankly if anybody had enough money in an exchange to warrant this amount of upset, maybe that person should reconsider how they trade. 
So thank you to the whole BFX team, I know you guys have been working overtime to sort this out as best you can, and thats more than can be said than most companies.

While I agree, who would be insane enough to not take a second traditional card? I'm with Monzo here in the UK (they've not got anything to do with  crypto, just traditional banking with tech from this century) and I love their product, but Jesus if I'm going abroad I'm taking a card from a bigger bank with me just in case!

If you're transferring money to the Philippines regularly, can I ask a question? Do you know how the party in the Philippines turns that Bitcoin back into Fiat?
