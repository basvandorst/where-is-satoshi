If content creators explicitly keep ads and trackers off their websites but have a bitcoin tip jar, then it could be an alternative source of revenue that people can support. I was just searching for a solution to a problem I had with my computer and the page with the answer had pop-up ads, required registration to access the forum, etc. Honestly I would have rather paid a $1 tip directly to the person who provided the solution to my problem.

Just posted this in another thread...
As someone who has bought across 3 orders of magnitude ($10, 100, 1000) it's hard to understand the hyperventilating about a 20 percent change over a few weeks. But I feel like a late adopter because I never bought coins for under a buck. Still hoping to join the 4-orders club....hopefully on the upside ;-)

I am on my phone so it is hard for me to check, but wasn't btc to USD around $400 in April of this year? and if I'm not mistaken wasn't it around $150 at this time last year. So doesn't it really depend on when you pick your starting point for comparison?

Curious to see what it turns out to be.
By the way, smart people get paid millions (billions?) to attack currencies. I would not be surprised if some of that begins to get targeted at bitcoin sooner or later. It's only felt a relatively insignificant and benign "financial warfare" so far. 
This is good, because it will help bitcoin ecosystem shore up its defenses.

Exactly. If I control the majority of hashing, then I'm going to profit from all the new blocks. Why would risk my huge financial stake in the system by blowing it up? Only if an institution (military, bank consortium) wanted to destroy bitcoin would this be plausible. But hopefully we have enough of a multipolar world where that is becoming implausible.

Because people with a lot of capital are trying to drive down the price so they can buy up a lot of them.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:38:00
Can't believe this is the top answer.*
Selling bitcoins when there is no buyer is known as burning or destroying bitcoins. That's obviously not what's happening.
Rather, more people want to sell than buy, allowing buyers to negotiate a better deal (i.e. lower price)
We can ask WHY more people are selling than buying, but the comment you replied to ("price is dropping because no one is buying bitcoin, everyone is just selling") is so stupid that it should be ridiculed instead of upvoted.

Decentralized, ecologically sustainable communities that provide for the material needs of people. Keep building these from the bottom up and we might have a chance at surviving the next century, which is going to be a tumultuous time. Apologies for the death, destruction, and suffering that "we" in the west have inflicted on people all over the world. Hopefully we can start to learn from the global south, who have been leading the way forward to a more humane, just, and prosperous world - not one in which only a few prosper materially at the expense of the rest of the planet, but in which human-kind is able to prosper by forging real human relations and to develop our true potentiality.

If you have a bank account, you are lending money to that bank. The money is not your in your possession anymore. It's even worse than putting cash into a safe deposit box. In terms our deposits and withdrawals, banks have regulations on how they can exchange money with customers, and they have their own shitty policies, too. That's why I'm rooting for bitcoin. But I didn't think I was saying anything controversial.

If you have your money in dollar bills or bitcoin or gold, then yes. But the whole article and discussion is about banks. If you have a savings account with $20k in it, you don't have the money. You are lending it to your bank. I didn't think my point was controversial, maybe I should have added "in the bank" but it was pretty obvious to me from the context.

Sounds like we are in similar positions. Bought my first coin for $99 in August 2013 and have only managed to accumulate a few more fractions of a coin since then. I also just exchanged my BCC for BTC so increased my BTC by about 20% "for free". But what the heck do I know about any of this? Nothing - I'm not a developer nor miner nor investor. Can't say if BCC is artificial  but to my untrained eye it looks like some shenanigans. Good luck to both of us.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:17:21
Yes I see now, the average block time is very short. I was using bittrex and created an account just for this purpose. They require 6 confirmations before the deposit is available in the account. Was stuck on 3/6 confirmations for a long time, not sure why.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:57:40
Maybe I said the wrong thing in my previous comment... I finally got around to splitting my coins and redeemed my 'free' Bitcoin Cash and exchanged them for BTC. Expanded my modest hodlings by 22% (exchange rate at the time). I got lucky. Splitting the coins was easy enough, but sending them to the exchange took what felt like forever, waiting waiting waiting for confirmations. Had to wait overnight, worked out in my favor as the exchange rate kept increasing, price literally went up 50% while I was waiting for the transaction to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:02:21
Actually it was the BCC confirmation time that was slow. The fees were lower than BTC I'll grant you that. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:24:48
Interesting, however the title should say that microbits are **subjectively** superior since after all objectively they refer to an amount of bitcoin which doesn't change regardless of the metric.

Isn't this a potential attack vector on bitcoin in general? Imagine an entity (us military) or consortium of organizations (bank cartel) with money to burn. Set up huge mining pools under their control, possibly using hardware developed and fabricated in house. Can't such an entity turn on mining power and accumulate block rewards, then switch off when the difficulty gets readjusted upward, selling the coins, and repeating the cycle? I always thought this was a possibility and seeing as how easy it is for Bcash mining to disrupt bitcoin may encourage such attacks in the future from those who are truly threatened by bitcoin.

This thread:


[Three days ago](


Which one is it?
I'm not one to knee-jerk denounce redditors just because their accounts are new, but inconsistency raises suspicion.
As for your question:  first a disclaimer, I am not an expert and have only a tiny Bitcoin hodling and (like you say in the other post) I, too, split my coins and exchanged my BCC for BTC. With that being said, **hodl**
If BCC becomes dominant and BTC disappears, you would still have the same number of BCC. If there is another hardfork, you will still have the same number of those coins as well. No matter how many forks, you still control the private keys. The problem emerges if the entire crypto space sees a complete collapse. Doubtful that would happen. If even one of the Bitcoin forks is successful and you hodled, then isn't your investment safe?
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:07:17
No problem! As a casual hodler, the hard fork has been confusing for me. I didn't want to risk losing my BTC private keys or do anything dumb so I waited for a while before splitting my coins, but that process turned out to be easy. It felt good at first to have equal amounts of both coins, but I concluded that it made sense to take advantage of the opportunity to increase my BTC at no cost by selling the BCC. Hope that turns out to he the right thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:06:53


Surprised when they learn they can buy a fraction of a coin.
If they want to use bitcoin to buy coffee, then microbits are better. If they want to see it as a store of value, then maybe we should price it in kilobitcoins.... 1 kBTC =  3,330,000 USD (so valuable...wow!)
I only say that half jokingly since gold is priced in grams and kilograms.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:16:27
bittrex. I was surprised because the average block time was around 12 minutes when I initiated the deposit. It was stuck at 3/6 confirmations for hours. Not sure if it was a glitch on the exchange side or what happened. For what it's worth this is the first time I've used an exchange and had just created an account for this purpose, so maybe that had something to do with it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:32:56

Not saying you're wrong, but you're wrong. Interest payments are about half of what you claim (no where near $1 trillion annually) 
 
Rising interest rates matter to newly issued debt, not existing debt. As far as I can tell, deficits are under control as a percent of GDP, so accumulation of new debt is not some sort of apocalyptic scenario as you describe.

I'm not saying bitcoin isn't a revolutionary technology, but where we are today, it is still at its infancy. For the time being (probably a long time) bitcoin will operate along side - and most likely at the margins - of the global financial system.
Still, there's plenty of room for it to grow.
