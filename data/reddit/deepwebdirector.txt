This thread is a trainwreck.

The governance problem is a big one and their solutions are quite interesting. I just wonder if their price went up just a bit too fast considering that they don't really have a working project yet. Even their wallet is still a mess (his words).

But he is ultra rich.

I like having my healthcare and social security. Thanks for the insult though.

Have you read the whitepapers of the most solid projects?

If I get your keys I can just open electrum and your wallet with it. The passphrase is like the key to your vault. You should keep the passphrase offline, away from anything that can be hacked.

I eat up as much fud as I can constantly. Try browsing biz when there  is no light at the end of the tunnel and BTC is in freefall. It's a fun experience.

You created a handful of points of failure. Is one of those gets hacked the your money is gone. Cold storage.

Sure absolutely. What are you doing right now with crypto to hedge against losses? Basically moving short positions?
It's lose btw. Sorry for being a grammar nazi but I read that spelling error too often around here.

Some people buy at mountain peaks, others sell at mountain peaks.
Buy high sell low.

It will hit resistance around 9200 and bounce back to 5K.
After that moon.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:38:04
Lol, it is definitely not a giant conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:00:59
Before or after BTC goes down to below 5K again?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:13:16
I don't understand why you are asking. You can just have a look at the charts yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:36:35
OP, I doubt you've read the original source. Because what GS said is correct.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:41:56
9K is the big resistance.

Read the Wikipedia article on the railway bubble. It's eerily similar to crypto. They knew railway was going to be big but most retail investors still lost their shirts by buying railtracks and failing company stocks.

Just so you know: you are allowed to swear on the internet.

Are you offended for the people of Bermuda?
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:38:54
In Bermuda it is.
