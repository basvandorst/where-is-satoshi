But what is the power of bitcoin that is backing it? The amount of time and power it takes to mine it? That doesn't sound very valuable.

Why would you say such a thing without knowing if this guy already has financial security?

Fair enough :)

It's all just created out of thin air though. With nothing real to back it up.

Could be but we are still very far away from that and it's not gonna be bitcoin unless a lot of things get changed. It's like the swiss bank says; Bad for enviroment, expensive and slow to exchange and you still can't buy a cup of coffe with it.

Then I would need to go all the way to Schaarbeek for a coffee. That would be insane. 
I also red quite a few articles on energy consumption. I don't think your source is really neutral since it's a cryptocurrency newssite. I think it's a bit comparing apples to oranges since it's not yet used on a global scale or in the same way normal money is used. There are a lot of things to take into account.
But let's say you're right, then why is Bitcoin not taking of
 as a currency? Why doesn't it work in the same way that Paypal does for instance? A service where I easily put in money and can easily use to pay online. At this moment it's just a stock where people put in money in the hopes it will make them rich

If I want to transfer money to my buddy that is a matter of seconds. Go to my banking app, choose how much I want to send and bam, there it is. I can't do that with bitcoin. I'm also pretty sure I can't buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin here in Brussels. 
Can you give me a source on how bitcoin is less energy demanding than normal currencies. I've red a few articles about the topic and they seem hard to compare. At this moment a bitcoin transaction just takes more energy then a normal transaction. If Bitcoin really wants to become the next currency, this just needs be better and faster.
