Everyone agrees that whistle-blowing is a necessary, even desireable function if the proper procedures are not being followed. Laws were passed to protect whistle-blowers (and not just in the US).
Snowden's problem is that his bosses knew exactly what was going on, they knew they were acting in a most blatant violation of the Constitution.
In particular, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence perjured himself before Congress, denying that the NSA was collecting masses of personal material from Americans.
Clapper should not have told Congress a bald-faced lie, and shouldn't have snooped into anyone's metadata to begin with.
Clapper should be in the slammer, not Snowden.
