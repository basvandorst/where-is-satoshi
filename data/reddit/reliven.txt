Oh, no! I think there's a bit of miscommunication here.
I do recognize the value of bitcoins! I have been using them for a few years now and really appreciate their diverse potential.


I was talking about the market's valuation that a Bitcoin is presently worth 40-some dollars. I think as much as $15-20 of that 'value' is driven by people speculating: they are betting that the price will increase again so that they can sell it for a profit. I think that this first drop is telling us that a lot of the $40 'value' is unfounded.


True, I think it very well could.
Assuming what I said above about the true 'value' of btc: These smaller (more vulnerable) users will be tricked into believing that the value of a btc is higher than it should be and will then suffer as the market falls further when the big wallet sells.

I am confidant in saying that current rates are not true. They are too high and will, within the short term, fall below true value and then rise above, again, over the medium term.

The btc halving is negligible, over the short- and medium-term, considering the volume of coins already in the market. I don't think that it will propagate into prices for some time.
Do you think it isn't negligible?

Okay, I understand a bit better what you're saying.
I don't think that the price rises are accurately reflecting the demand not being met because of the new reward.
I understand how hard-costs affect the miner and I see that because unmet demand was then being met by 'holders', prices rise to incentivize our holders being a bit looser with their wallets.
So yeah, you are probably right about the slight supply shock! I don't think, however, that any significant portion of this 3 month increase is due to that. I'm still thinkin' the rapid change in demand lead to consumers and speculators which lead to more and more. Exacerbating the supply shock, though!

The systematic introduction of blocks does not affect supply. There is a constant, steady stream of btc.
Demand has increased dramatically over the past few months. Initially through the acceptance of btc in more normal transactions such as Reddit accepting it to pay for gold. This sparked investor and consumer interest in btc followed by a plague of media attention. Media attention leads to increases of demand through both speculators and consumers which starts feeds back onto itself - raising prices until points like today where btc dropped 30% in a 3 hour timespan.

You're looking at growth that is already a piece of the bubble. Look farther out. It's true value will follow a much less steep curve.

Yeah, I bet it will be, too. I imagine that by that time, opportunities to use btc will be more pervasive, providing a more diverse consumer base and more foundation for its value.
T'was nice talking to you, Anenomes. Hope your day went well.

So much of this is fueled by speculation and hopes that valuations will increase again:
What happens when everyone realizes that this first drop is indicative of the lack of real value and demand in the btc market? Some might sell again, triggering another fall.
If big players are in here, they can put large bids at 40 just to subdue the market and sell their whole wallet, cashing in on the false security of the 40 mark.
