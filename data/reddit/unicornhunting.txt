Why is it the low fees always seem to happen on a weekend?

Ok well have you tried asking them for their story?

Rome was built stone by stone though.

What if you are actually the fringe group?

So I googled it and am not really finding anything... I did find one more address pointed to that was active until April, but it seems it is just [a coin mixer](
Other than that, all the links were either speculation with no references, or talked about either the 2015 event or the odd graph that stopped in January.  Did I miss something in the search?

Is there somewhere that links to or tracks suspicious transactions thought to be spam since March when fees really rose?  It seems there's lots of other explanations for the graphs

Hmm, it seems the only thing linked there to show that the rise is due to spam is a Bitfury address doing suspicious transactions... 
But Bitfury isn't a part of the ver group pushing big blocks, why would they be the only spammer?

Sorry, that's not really convincing.  The first one I don't agree with &amp; doesn't reference any specific things indicating spam, the second one is the one I already mentioned showing the 2015 and pre-january stuff.  Nevermind
