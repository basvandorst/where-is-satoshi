Yes, let's pretend Bitsquare does any meaningful volume and cite it as a credible example. Might as well cite local bitcoins as well. Together they are a joke.

Look, you are giving a very complicated answer, which means you aren't answering the question. I am an ordinary Joe who wants to ACH or wire my fiat to a decentralized exchange in order to buy bitcoin. Explain how that would be possible.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:20:26
Exactly how do I get my fiat onto a decentralized exchange?
So many people have talked about a decentralized exchange for years now, yet none has arised. Why? Because you can never have a low-latency decentralized exchange. It is physicall impossible. A centralized exchange will alsways be faster and have more liquidity. So this is not a practical solution.

1. You don't answer the question. How do I get my fiat from my bank account via ACH/Wire onto a decentralized exchange in order to buy bitcoin?
2. low-latency is not low-liquidity. there is no counterparty risk at all on a central exchange. The only risk is that the exchange itself will not fulfill the trade (due to a hack, etc.). in fact, localbitcoins has huge counterparty risk. This doesn't answer the question.

How about being constructive rather than critical? I know reddit can be annoying...

I guess you like free markets, where people can create fake news, fake business, fake products and services, ponzi schemes, affinity scams, and get away with it all, because there's be no laws or regulators to prevent them? Good for you!! What a great world!
And I guess you are an alt-right Austrian economics whiz who has a very deep grasp of economics rooted in 1. extensive banking and finance experience 2. an economics degree of some kind.
Because otherwise you sound just like all the other ill-informed, uneducated idiot cranks on this forum

If you can't explain how then you don't know yourself, and I'm not going to do the reading for you. If you really know how, then please explain. And yes the laws of physics apply to NASDAQ, that is exactly my point. Place a trade via co-located server on NASDAQ's exchange, and it will execute long before that same trade crosses the ocean, where a 'decentralized' exchange node would be able to even record it, much less respond to it. And in the mean time, NASDAQ would have handled a few hundred other trades...

Are you actually in China? Because if not, then what the hell is your point? China's gov't will kill bitcoin in that country if they choose to, and there's nothing your ignorant little token effort can do about it. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:30:07
PBoC can and will kill bitcoin in China if they choose to. All they need to do is shutdown exchanges, and leave people unable to convert Yuan to digital currency. That would be the end. Let's not pretend it isn't a risk. And that will affect the price.

1. Please explain how Bitsquare provides a fiat entry point? I want to deposit my fiat in my bank account onto the decentralized exchange via ACH or Wire. How do I do that?
2. Does answer the question
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:17:40
Has nothing to do with economics. Has to do with a country choosing to restrict currency movements across its border. Its political. Like it or not, digital currency can not get around political will and law.

And the speed of light has been a constant for a long, long time as well. So what's your point? Do you propose to alter the speed of light?
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:21:33
We'll see. Its also likely that withdrawals will not be re-established except to source addresses from verified domestic customers. That would effectively cripple capital flight.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:40:47
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:37:40
Nope. Not the same. You simply don't understand financial systems. Ignorance doesn't allow you to maintain false hope. Why don't you also claim that you can alter the speed of light? Because that is the fundamental physics impacting latency on a decentralized system.
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:36:28
I guess you've never worked in banking or finance. To handle fiat you'd need bank accounts to process fiat. How does a decentralized exchange, with no owner or authority, get a bank account to handle desposits/withdrawals of fiat? Simple...it doesn't. End of story.
Latency is not a farce. It is key to liquidity. Let's not try to pretend otherwise. If you don't have low-latency, then you won't have any algo traders, and they make up the bulk of trading on every major global financial exchange today. And liquidity generates best price. Just compare the price of bitcoin on a top exchange and popular currency pair against a low liquidity exchange with an unpopular currency pair.

I'm wrong about the speed of light? How long does it take light to travel around the world? Too long for low-latency exchanges. So if you decentralize an exchange, you quickly hit a problem of physics. It takes time for light to cross the Pacific ocean. By the time you send a single message, its too late compared with NASDAQ or any other major exchange.

If you can't explain how in a couple sentences, then either you don't understand how or it doesn't do what you think. Very simple quetsion: How/where do I deposit my fiat (Via ACH or Wire) on a decentralized exchange in order to buy bitcoin?

Engineers do not necessarily make good business people or politicians. Andreas should stick to engineering. He doesn't get business.

They are just stop orders. They are not triggers or stop limit orders. When the stop price is it, it becomes a market order to buy/sell the quantity specified. Its really very simple. Except it doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:04:00
NO! That's not how stop orders work. You've obviously never traded other instruments before. When you place a stop order for a certain quantity, then that quantity is traded. period. when the stop order is triggered, it becomes a market order for the quantity specified. That is what is supposed to happen.

I am NOT using my accounts for any improper activity WHATSOEVER. The accounts were frozen due to a possible identity theft. Yet weeks later, I have no update and no idea when I will have access to my funds again.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:06:56
I know that. Its public info. I'm asking for contact details.
