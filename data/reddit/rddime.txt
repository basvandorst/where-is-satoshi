Please feel free to correct me because I don't actually know anything about this.
I read the bitcoin white paper and I understand how bitcoin works because it provides the math and proofs.
I read the crypto.com whitepaper and I might as well have watched Carlos Matos tell me all about bitconnect 2.0. What am I gonna do!?!?
Seriously, calling a commercial pamphlet a "white paper".

I don't think they tried to attack your credentials as much as ask you to provide your credentials and take the conversation somewhere else where it could have actually helped the project.
You started your line of conversation on bitcointalk, not the best place for civilized conversation. I've gotten to know most of the guys who worked on the curecoin team over a period of 6 months as they prepared to launch and they tried every possible avenue many times to get Stanford as involved as they could. In the end, they launched with what they could.
As for your idea about curecoin 2.0, that'd be ideal, but it's not the real world. Stanford only wanted to be tangentially tied to curecoin and would not help release a crypto currency. The world of academic research is in no way ready for something like that. And while you're the lead dev of the folding at home client, can you confirm whether you are an employee of Stanford?

Posted this comment on the article:
How does an "analyst" come up with the brilliant headline of "... spike over 65% after Winklevoss ETF". Said "analyst" also claims to be a wall street banker? The thesis estimates that the expected value of btc right is 165% of what it is. After the ETF is either approved or denied, the price is hypothesized to either go rising up to ~368% of current price or come crashing down to 55% of current price.
Have you ever actually worked with numbers? The sheer stupidity of that headline is mind boggling.
Today's price: say $1000. Expected value is $1645.45 BECAUSE in a month, we will enter into a gamble with estimated odds of 35:65 that price will be $3678:$551.
After ETF (the gamble), the price is one of those two numbers, not $1645. This is the time when schrodinger's box is opened and we no longer have a 50% alive cat. The cat is either alive or dead.

The point that "the hashrate can't keep doubling" is much easier to show than this.
Instead try using hash/j curve (of asics) and try to see if that can get low enough to supply that amount of generation.
