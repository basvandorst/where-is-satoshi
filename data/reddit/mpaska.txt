Highly anonymous, scam proof, secure you say? Given the site is using Wordpress, which has one of the most notorious [security track records]( you're not going to be taken seriously. 
You've also got a bunch of spelling and grammar mistakes, the first page I looked at "Even with P-to P exchanges its very simple find out the bank account..." makes no sense.

So what are the current fiat withdrawal methods? It's not entirely clear from the site what (if any) they are.

What industry and country are you in? We're at 0.9% in I.T. with 80%+ online sales (including box and software sales) with a volume *a lot* less than $600k/month. Our default rate by our Australian bank was 1.4% for $10,000/year in sales.
1.9% sounds very-very high given your sales. We see on average a 0.7 - 1.1% rate here for Australian small businesses. Highest I've ever seen from any of our clients (we do e-commerce integration work) was 1.7%.
Businesses always crack the 1% and under mark at around the 200k/year mark.

Mine is mostly incomplete as-well ([Using this torrent as the source]( I can account for 21-24% of my trading (Give or take a few percent, not sure what timezones are in play).

This is not entirely fair given your example. Someone processing $324,000/year would had moved on from Paypal, unless they were stupid. Talking from experience, most small businesses start to re-negoitate and move onto proper merchant solutions at around the 20-30k/year mark and negotiate much, much better rates past the 50-60k/year marks.
I've implemented upwards of around 200 e-commerce solutions mostly in the Australian market of small-to-medium sized business (2-50 employees) and I'd estimate for the bulk of customers, a 0.7 to 1.2% processing fee is about the norm for accepting credit cards online. The highest I've ever seen for a client is 1.7%.

I doubt that many people who were trading during the 2011 breach would had been burn't this time around. It would had been all the newcomers (2013+) who had been burnt the hardest.
I had just over 500 coins still in and honestly I don't care that they're now gone. Why?
* Most of us old timers (I bought coins in late 2010 &amp; been using Gox since mid-2011) never really expected the price to sky rocket like it has. I know we all like to dream, but during the 2010-2012 days I would never expect us to be where we are now.
* Many, many, many, many old timers (myself included) rode the 2013 wave with constant/steady withdrawals (albeit it, delayed - but still flowing). Even if I'd invested $50k into Gox (I haven't!), I'd still be way ahead even with 500 lost coins. I suspect quite a few old timers are in the same camp as me. A lot of fiat has been withdrawn from Gox!
I know of at-least 4 people who have paid off their mortgages due to MtGox. We all knew it was risky, we all knew their track record - but the chance of being able to one-day buy a yacht or two was just too tempting.
Honestly, to a lot of people/old timers. MtGox was probably just like spending a day in the casino. Except it paid out with relatively little risk.
While I know a lot of people recently in 2013 were using Gox as a trading platform, I'd suspect given the increasing withdrawal limiting and withdrawal delays that a lot of people were in the same boat as me - purely using Gox to pay some bills (and playing with a few coins here and there for fun).

Do you know that eBay owns [Gumtree](

Dell would be between 0.5-0.7%. Not a chance they'll be above 1%.

How do I access this said exchange? :)

Are Australian businesses allowed? And is there any profit sharing?

Definitely remove it. Take a look at Dominoes Australia as an example at Pizza ordering done somewhat right, they don't require any login/authentication.

It should be pointed out that you can do de-dup on encrypted data while still not having anyway to see the unencrypted end result or having any private keys be sent over the wire.
