 Is it true that Nathaniel Popper met you at a meeting recently?
Nick Szabo ‏  14h14 hours ago
 No.
Simon Embry ‏  12h12 hours ago
 Do you think someone posed as you? Perhaps Popper is making it all up.  
Nathaniel Popper ‏  4m4 minutes ago
  I met Nick in March 2014 as described in my story in the NYT. I assume Nick is saying we didn't meet recently? Nick?
Nick Szabo 
  We indeed met and talked briefly at a party in March 2014, which is hardly "recently".
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:56:23
check out my exchange just now with nick on twitter. he didn't interpret 'recently' to mean march 2014, which is when i met him. he gave an honest answer to an imprecisely worded question. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:57:51
first time i had to be asked to promote myself!
it's  
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:48:50
no mention of the price because they really weren't worth anything at the time! 
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:03:44
thanks so much -- i'm very happy to hear that
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:43:14




i appreciate that note. i have tried to always to be responsible and not overstate anything. in the book i hope you'll find lots of new stuff. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:19:43
i'm not going to argue that you would pick him out of this lineup from my description! this pic was a year after i met him, i believe -- and i didn't take a picture myself so i was relying on my notes -- but i may not have given the best description of his hair. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:34:39
yes -- itbit and dfs say that it does
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:48:42
It may be a pseudonym for someone, but the real name of the person I met, who was involved in the Cypherpunks, was Nick Szabo
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:34:15
hah -- if only reddit had copyeditors 
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:50:14
he did slow down -- but others also soon began doing their own gpu mining after bitcoin gained in popularity after the first slashdot item on bitocin.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:47:03
thanks so much -- hope you enjoy it
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:22:34
that's great to hear it. if you enjoy it, please do give it a review. that always helps.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:47:39
so many bitnuggets to mine!
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:41:04
there is indeed 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:43:06
it was a good thing to notice! thanks for being a careful reader. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:34:02


I had always heard that too -- but then I learned differently from Laszlo, and confirmed it by checking out all the coins he collected to his addresses during that time. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:41:36
thanks so much
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:12:55
the person in the photo who is nick szabo does not have blonde hair. he has dark hair -- on the baldness, you can't see the back of his head. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:04:08
the core developers i spoke to consider him one. that isn't measured in lines of code -- it is measured in participation in the process. i view the other developers as the best source on this. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:04:47
that's the sort of the comment that makes me feel it was worth writing this! thank you. and if you get a chance, review it on amazon.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:17:45
where is the evidence that r3 paid the nyt? do you realize what would happen if anyone at the nyt ever took money to write a story? 
this was a article for a general audience about the broad disagreements between the two camps (not just hearn) -- we didn't get into many of the details that each side believes discredits the other side. but i think we did present the broad areas of honest division.  
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:31:38
the link to buy it on overstock, where you can pay in bitcoin, is at the bottom of that post. unfortunately that's not signed -- but come out to one of the events that i'm trying to list on my website!
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:02:33
Maxwell has given up his commit access and Blockstream does not deny that he stepped back. We tried to get a fuller answer for why he stepped back but he doesn't currently want to provide one. I think we did what we could to report this out, but the facts themselves aren't in question. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:47:55
i hadn't considered that, but it's an interesting point
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:33:09
thanks -- that's nice of you to say. as a reporter, i try to look at the pros and cons of everything i cover. i'm actually the kind of person who views the whole world this way -- so the views i express on that nypl talk and elsewhere really do express my own views at this point. i see the strength and i see the weaknesses. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:47:30
If you look at the Internet Archive of the page you can see that Nick wrote the item on bit gold markets in April 2008 
There was an earlier item on bit gold that he had written in 2005 and that was reposted in 2008 -- but that's a different post. 
It was the 2008 post that led to the conversation about coding up bit gold. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:02:11
It's Nathaniel, the author of that article. That's the same person I met. It may just be the resolution of this photo, but you can't see the flecks of grey hair and you can't see the back of his head. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:00:10
that's very nice of you -- thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:55:40
check out that item by tim swanson that you linked to -- artforz began mining with his gpu in july 2010 -- laszlo began doing it in april 2010. there may have been someone before that who had tried it, but laszlo's suggest once he did try it suggested that no one else was doing it seriously. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:04:10
i've replied to a few other folks -- but yes, this is the same person i met. you can't see the bald spot from this angle, nor the flecks of grey hair. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:36:24
i appreciate that. thanks. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:46:06
cited at the bottom -- but the email is from laszlo
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:21:03
this story was centrally about mike hearn. he is the one quitting so we focused on him. in past stories i have focused on passionate believers and focused less on their detractors. this is the way journalism works -- one story at a time. as each development happens. the discrete development here was hearn quitting. i certainly tried to provide the context for that by talking with all the other players. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:15:55
Hey Greg -- I reached out to you and you didn't respond. So I spoke with people who knew you and they told me what they knew about your thinking. That isn't baseless conjecturing. That is working with the best info I had. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:21:35
so happy to hear it -- hope you enjoy it too
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:45:55
we certainly did our best to convey the views of both sides in this debate -- and the one thing that they both agree on, which is that they are incredibly frustrated and losing interest. note that maxwell appears to have stepped back for the same reason as hearn. 
so far, hearn is the one person in this debate saying he is leaving it all behind -- and i thought that decision was momentous enough to document it, whatever side he is on. 
i think if you go back and look at my writing i have covered the complexities of bitcoin from all angles, and will continue to. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:02:50
It's Nathaniel, the author of that article. That's the same person I met. It may just be the resolution of this photo, but you can't see the flecks of grey hair and you can't see the back of his head.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:04:34
a photographer in zurich took it
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:50:23
we reached out to everyone mentioned in the story before we published it, to get their comments. that is how we had quotes from people. 
in almost every story we write, the subjects of the story know generally when the story will be published. if we didn't let our subjects know we couldn't get their thoughts for our stories. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:59:51
even if you no longer consider him a bitcoin developer, hearn certainly was a leading developer in the past. i haven't heard even his opponents dispute that. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:38:30
thanks -- i'll wait to enjoy it until the book is actually out into the world
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:00:48
I didn't even get a t-shirt! Actually that's not true, I got a bunch of promotional t-shirts at conferences that are generally too small for me. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:16:36
hah. well, thanks for agreeing with my editing sensibility!
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:32:44
very nice of you.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:39:33
thank you
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:45:36
i'm sorry to hear that felix's piece had that effect on you. it wasn't a great representation of my book. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:23:18
mike hearn, on reddit? great to see that you found this interesting, mike! 
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:05:07
that's the only way i've seen to do it so far
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:26:32
beautiful! thank you. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:18:43
thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:15:53
Thanks for reading everyone. For more on the inception of this story, and the book that it is drawn from, see my recent post: 
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:18:29
yes it is indeed genuine. check out my last post for the backstory.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:45:06
i hadn't looked before, but here it is:  
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:21:55
you are right that a lot of the things Satoshi described here later came to pass.
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:04:40
thanks for reading!
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:59:25
sadly, for now that is the only way. i will let overstock know that you can't do it from there. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:25:17
i love it -- let's get this out of the grapevine and into the world. please introduce yourself at the nypl talk if you can. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:58:52
Thanks -- it will be published by Penguin in the UK on the same day, so should be available there on Amazon, though not necessarily on Overstock. 
Let me save my predictions for once the book is out there and you and everyone get a sense of where I am coming from. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:04:46
please do!
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:33:20
thanks for letting me know -- i just fixed it. just sorry that no one had tried to click on it sooner!
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:39:45
rabble rouse away!
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:59:28
That was the part of the book I probably rewrote the most times. Here is a short little part of it that I have on my website:
 
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:00:03
hopefully i'll get a wide range of people giving their thoughts on the book -- that list on my site is just to get it started. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:24:51
thanks erik -- and thanks for your help in making it happen. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:27:08
i wish i'd gotten your input before i put the item up. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 21:07:42
thanks so much. it was a fun story to report out
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:01:14
i hope to oblige on all counts
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:40:52


they were doing direct transfers -- 
all the businesses i spoke with saw increasing activity, but it's hard to say for argentina as a whole 
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:02:04
for one possible explanation on that count, see the comment below from googlemaster1
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:19:42
There were several earlier trades of Bitcoin for fiat done by NewLibertyStandard and Martti Malmi, among others. Here is some documentation on one from Oct. 2009 that valued 5,050 BTC for $5.02:
