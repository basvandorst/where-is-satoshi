Totally fair point.
I think that distribution is an issue in every decentralized cryptocurrency - as long as the initial method doesn't kill the crypto before it matures it essentially did its job.
"Fair" initial distribution is a tough nut to crack, especially as the other systems around coins evolve. POS systems don't allow for "mining" so another solution had to be created for Nxt.
That said, I agree, pre-mine aspects are definitely one of the downsides.

If anyone comes up with a interesting solution to this problem, I have tipbutton.com and would be willing to put it to good use :)

haha, exciting times ahead :)

So maybe a 64 GB USB / SSD and a small input screen?

What would be the minimal viable hardware device needed to execute bitcoin transactions?
How cheap could that device be built? Like a 'bank in your pocket' for the 3rd world.

Anyone trying to sell their XRP for Bitcoin, shoot me a message, I'll buyem (if you give me a good rate). I'm bullish ;)

That's true - but that's their incentive to make it work.
Satoshi has a large percentage of BTC, too.

LOVE the renderings!! How would you like me to source it? Any particular link you'd like?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:27:32
Wording was unclear - fixed.
You can certainly get a confirmation within 15 mins... but the entire transaction likely won't be verified for 1 hour+

With you on this - bought a new computer yesterday and am putting all my coins in cold storage. A paradigm shift is happening before our eyes.
Very interesting to hear you're in ripple - I took a large position in it a few months back when one of our advisors jumped on board Ripple Labs.
Interesting times are ahead ;)
Also, check out colored coins - that concept is fascinating, I think you'd be interested.

haha yes, currently were iOS only, but we'll have a fully functional mobile optimized website where you can list items just as easily (via any smartphone).
We also have an android app planned in the future - but we want to nail down all our features in iOS before we spend time &amp; money developing for a second platform :)

Craigslist adding BTC would be a brilliant idea! That said, I doubt craigslist will make the move anytime soon.
This may be a little early, but we plan on building in Bitcoin payments into [SellSimple]( - this may solve the problem you're talking about.
SellSimple is an (free) iOS app &amp; website that lets you snap a picture, enter your details, and instantly sell on Craigslist, eBay, Etsy, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.
With a btc integration, you could instantly post to craigslist and include the SellSimple listing url which would accept both CC &amp; bitcoin. If you're a seller who only accepts bitcoin, we would automatically convert the credit card purchases into btc for you. 
This would enable non-btc buyers to purchase from btc-only sellers. You can accept bitcoin without decreasing your pool of potential buyers.
That said, this is still a ways out in our development pipeine. Interested in hearing the communities thoughts on this feature.
Disclosure: I'm the ceo of [SellSimple](

Haha yes - it was intended to be a bit extreme in order to both illustrate a point and make the story somewhat interesting to read.
The idea isn't to go BUY a bunch of bitcoin after you get screwed - it's to already own a bunch of bitcoin incase anything happens.
For most of my recent design &amp; development clients I've asked for payment in BTC. Most are fine with it. They just make a CoinBase account and I lock in the price for them so fluctuations don't matter.
You're totally correct that if the FBI or NSA are after you, you probably have bigger problems. The article was more a hypothetical thought experiment.

I'd love to buy a Bitcoin ATM for our office - are you selling them for less than $2k?
Shoot me a PM - I'd love to get involved, awesome stuff :)
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:10:15
Awesome landing page - Would love to test it out!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:08:29
Haha surprisingly I found out about colored coins after Ripple, I did a lot of research on Ripple.
It wasn't until someone on reddit mentioned it in a comment that I checked out the specs and became hooked on the concept.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:49:16
Haha don't you worry about my portfolio, I'm doing fine :)
When you have 10 people a day asking you the same questions, it's a lot easier to teach via blog post then repeat the same stuff over and over.

Pico &amp; Robertson! You're so close! 
I'll try and come by this week or next week with a bunch of friends who recently got into bitcoin / cryptocurrencies.
So awesome!

We'll be integrating a new CL posting method soon (we have one now, but its not ideal).
The new posting integration will open the CL posting page in a webview with all of your listing info pre-filled. 
All you'll have to do is click "post" and it will automatically post your listing to CL using the email used when signing up to SS.
