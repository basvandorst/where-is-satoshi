Anytime, will always help to make posts about aphelion more visible, hey have you any idea where Ian just sent those 500k aph to?

Okay, so the more FUD a project gets the more legit it is, and in your eyes FUD is when someone shows how shit a token and it’s CEO is l, because I regard FUD as stuff that’s made up to deliberately tank a tokens price, no one cares if your token tanks, we would just rather not get to see people offload their worthless bags on newcomers, why can’t you just show me where I’m wrong?
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:22:42
Crosschain,? you won’t have crosschain. Not this year or next, and there’s that word again, “team”, one man being contracted to copy/paste things isn’t really much of a team is it? And why doesn’t the CEO use his own dex to trade on if it’s “the worlds greatest dex” instead of using other DEXs and CEXs, such an odd thing to do especially after all his claims and with how much he hates centralised exchange and doesn’t trust them?
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:06:54
Not a sin to believe in it, but to deliberately try to promote this shit as something amazing while accusing everyone of FUD is a real piece of shit thing to do, post everything and let people make up their own mind fairly on it instead of cherry picking bullshit hype claims and trying to pass it off as world changing when 100% the opposite is true, CEO keeps talking about the code speaks for itself and it does, but it’s got severe disabilities and likes to lick windows, the only dex worse than it is etherdelta
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:29:39
Please please show me where I’m wrong, you’ve claimed it a few times now but haven’t shown it yet.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:03:15
Please show me where what I’ve said is wrong instead of avoiding it.

Ahahahhahahahaha it just gets funnier the more you write

Cmc has it down as $700 and so does aph dex wallet reported it as such when there was $0 traded, again trying to say I’m wrong while refusing to back it up, would you like the screenshot of where there was no trades made at the time I said so? I always know how much volume there is by looking at the trade history, you are absolutely clueless as to how your dex works, why not ask Gareth as to why the dex volume does not auto update to show past 24hours as he has already been asked it but looks like you may have missed his answer. Seemingly it may be too resource heavy to calculate its true volume, now we’re up to 36 hours without a trade being made.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:15:35
You don’t want a quick 10x now because it didn’t happen, but all last week you wouldn’t shut up about it. 20% up since bitmart listing,  zoom out just a little bit more and you’ll see it’s been dumping since bitmart listing announcement. You know that announcement where the CEO claimed to have turn down several top20 exchanges who called him up and instead settled for “the one” which is also supposedly a strategic partnership yet turns out it was the only one who was giving out free listings and they don’t know anything about the partnership yet
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:43:44
Bitconnect also had a product
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:25:18
Scared of aph??? Seriously is that the best you can come up with,  scared of the “worlds greatest dex” as claimed many time by the ceo yet on a real good day it makes a whopping $250 in dex trades, it works but barely and is still full of bugs and glitches that it first launched with,  its fake claim after fake claim with Ian, world class dev team huh, perhaps you can name who they are? Or perhaps you can answer why the dex code isn’t open source and hadn’t been audited yet? And now he’s going to release a btc wallet that doesn’t even support ledger... who do you think is going to send their btc from a secure wallet to one that’s going to be full of bugs, no code to review and no audit done on it? There is no world class dev team, like how they still haven’t updated the website even though the people are long gone after they dumped all their advisor aph tokens on fools like you a long time ago, and yet here you still are, doing your absolute best to try and pump this piece of shit coin because you got utterly destroyed by the CEO, and the icing on the cake was the CEO himself saying anyone who bought aph to speculate with is stupid and delusional.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:30:57
Why is the dex reporting fake volume? It claims to have $700 of trades but if you log in and check the trade history you’ll see there’s not a single trade done in the last 24 hours, so what you have is a piece of shit dex that manipulates it’s reported volume, $0 volume yet its the worlds greatest ahahahhahahahahhahahaha

Guarantee it ahahahahahhahahahah your word is a joke, the only thing Daniel Simon does is come out with absurd price predictions to make himself feel better about his shitcoin. Guarantee I won’t be banned ahahahhahahaha, I joined a group just 2 weeks ago and your CEO immediately left it.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:57:17
Sweet, so let them all come in to show me where I’m wrong
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:10:26
You can’t show me where I’m wrong can you?
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:25:00
This should be a “lightbulb moment” for you.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:19:01
Perhaps you should go check out an old wallet on neo called Morpheus, that had btc/ltc/erc wallet integration a year ago and long before Aphelion ever tried to claim they were the first.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:02:40
Please show me where what I’ve said is wrong, it can’t be that hard.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:06:07
We’re at 69 comments because you refuse to show where what I’ve said is false as you claim, and no one else has come to back you up even though you were begging for help in telegram, pretty much sums it up really, CEO was spot on when he called ye stupid and delusional
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:20:30
No they don’t, they banned people for asking basic questions
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:04:15
Please show me where what I’ve said is wrong, so far you haven’t refuted one thing let alone all of it like you claim is false.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:46:50
Oh okay, you just make a blanket statement and suddenly it’s all wrong yet you have absolutely nothing to back it up, is this the crosschain that he said he would have ready by Q2 2018, or the crosschain he said they were working on at the end of 2018, or the crosschain he said they were working on throughout Q1 and Q2 of 2019 while dumping the teams aph tokens on buyers just after releasing news updates? Are we talking about the same crosschain here, the crosschain development that isn’t even started yet?
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:32:48
Gareth’s not happy with you right now.
@_date: 2019-07-20 02:14:38
You could do with having a read of this, aphelion ticks off far too many of these such as repository/low activity/anonymous team/mystery funding/low team engagement/over hype/ misleading features/publicity stunts
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:45:16
Well whatever I have lost, not one cent was lost in that shitcoin. Ian is many things but a great CEO is not one of them, anyone can go ask over in r/neo who the ceo of aphelion is and they’ll be told what kind of scum he is, he even called his own token holders stupid and delusional for buying aph
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:42:50
“Ok&lt; I told them that they are doing this due to their contract , ergo they are doing a paid activity, since then they are stopped;)”.....
Yh sorry I had a shower and headed out for some food, paid activity, that’s a good one, also it would be great if your post did get more coverage because as I said I want people to go and use it and see how ridiculous it is.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:55:14
I’m a redditor for 3 weeks or this account is 3 weeks old? No, amazon full time dev, part time neo core dev, then whatever time is left over each week which is probably nothing goes to your dex, I honestly encourage everyone to go and use it and see for themselves how badly built it is. I want people to try and use it for themselves, to see no order book on most pairs, to see 50% spread on $0 volume books, I’m confident about what I say and so I want everyone to go and use it, you on the other hand only want people to buy the token because you know how shit the dex is
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:40:31
What does Nash have to do with this post? Do you see me out there writing shill posts about nash or running to Nash’s defence if someone writes something bad about it? Ah Jeff Solinksy, the guy who made this buggy piece of shit so far and who went back to amazon to a full time job after he got 100s of 1000s of dollars for forking the neon wallet and then copy/pasting code? That’s one name who isn’t doing much for aph now, so again, who is this world class dev team? How many hours a week do you think he’s putting into aphelion after  his full time amazon job and after his neo core contributions? No one is scared of aph, absolutely no one, they will never amount to anything, unlike pathetic shills who try to pump shitcoins to offload their bags on people there are other out there who are willing to provide all the information to help people make an informed decision, you refuse to accept any of the scamminess of this project and promote it everywhere you can, and I’ll always tell people the truth about it
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:19:23
All baseless accusations? Okay, tell me which ones you have a particular grievance with and we can talk about them. Your dex is not world class, not 1st world and not 3rd world, it’s like a school project that was given up on halfway through. It works but really fucking badly and that’s why no one wants to use it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:32:01
Hahahha where did I say anything about crosschain in that sentence, wallet integration doesn’t mean crosschain, what it means is yet more lies and playing with words by your CEO to claim things as huge and unique when they’ve already been done. And what happened to Morpheus in the end? Well they stopped developing because no one gave a shit about btc integration to the wallet as there’s so many wallets out there far better and specifically developed for just btc and not multiple chains, do you really think people will open their secure ledger to send their btc to aphelion? Because as aphelion btc doesn’t support ledger it means no one who owns a ledger can send btc using aph wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:03:32
Don’t forget to show everyone what the CEO gets up to besides his hyping bullshit 
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:27:47
I’m beginning to think you have severe learning disabilities, for the second time where do i say aph would have crosschain? I’m going to laugh so hard when aph disappears and I’ll be making a post about all the times we tried to show people why it will fail yet Ian somehow managed to keep recruiting more idiots, but being perfectly honest there is no one left in their telegram with an iq over 80 at this stage.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:30:23
Please please show me where I’m wrong, you’ve claimed it a few times now but haven’t shown it yet.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:51:31
Ah so you rely on a wash trading CEX to show how much volume your dex token has??? Didn’t you say just a few days ago it was going to 10x easy with the bitmart listing? How has that worked out for you so far, you don’t even know how many tokens are in circulation do you? I’m willing to bet you know pretty much nothing about aphelion as you were in their telegram shilling it for days before kucoin delisted it and when you went to go use aphelion dex you only then found out you had to do kyc on it and you weren’t that happy, but because you have no idea what you bought into and you wasted all your money on it, you now shill it with the most retarded of statements I’ve ever seen one guy make, you’ve gone from saying 100x to 1000x and still no one wants to buy your illiquid, zero volume, hidden code, unaudited, forked, copy/pasted, fake claims dex token. It’s going to go to zero and when it does you’ll reset your telegram and reddit
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:24:44
Just another thing about aph you haven’t a clue about yet think it’s great, why not go ask Ian what the 500k aph tokens he moved today were for and see what he says, also why not ask him how the entire buy order book on bitmart is worth about 0.1 btc yet the wash trading throws out up to $50k a day in volume, although I assume you haven’t a clue what I’m talking about their either, here’s a hint, go to bitmart and look at the whole buy book, you’re probably too still too stupid to see the obvious that no one wants to buy your shitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:34:14
100% $0 volume last 30 hours or so
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:43:53
When you going to show that what I said is wrong? You’re doing a lot of side stepping at the moment.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:09:52
Perfect ahahahahahahhaahhahaha how delusional or desperate can you be to say it’s perfect? If it’s perfect than why introduce a btc wallet that no one will use? If it’s perfect than why dont people use it? The huge update the CEO promised to the UI over a week ago was a change in fonts, any time any change is made people have to download and install a whole new wallet again, it’s pathetic
