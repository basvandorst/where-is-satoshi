with no fee paid to the miners there is no guarantee it will be included in a block. why not just include a tiny fee? 
I think you can use the RBF (replace by fee) feature to force the transaction through. RBF was implemented already, no?

I've seen that relatively clueless chick who runs BitNation interviewed by a couple different people and based on how clueless she seems to be about the technology I would tend to think that BitNation is, maybe not necessarily a *scam*, but probably not a very well thought-out business venture by some quite scammy sounding people. In any event, hopefully you didn't give them too much of your money. You may not see it again.

I would like to suggest thinking about it more along the lines of 'Where to host my keys' since that is actually what you do with bitcoin. The BTC stays out there on the public ledger, you can hold the keys or give them to a bank to hold for you (coinbase, etc)
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:30:23
No, web wallets are not safe, so I figure you may as well use one that is fast and easy to use. You can create a wallet protected by a password and only you hold the keys so.. technically, better than a lot of web wallets. I wouldn't use any web wallet, btw. Not for money I need to be safe. Offline storage is the best. Get a Trezor. Love mine. And they have a web interface for it.
@_date: 2016-08-24 00:55:33
Yes, you can still make bitcoin through mining.. technically.
Find an alt-coin with a low difficulty for mining that can be traded on an exchange for bitcoin. Mine that coin and turn them into bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:01:11
I'll say yes.
The more people are exposed to blockchains and their power through the big banks that they already trust to be authorities on fin-tech, the more people will become familiar with it and feel comfortable with the ideas and concepts behind blockchains and why they're important. Then they will look for one that is open and permission-less and free to use in any way they like, and there's only one.
The same thing happened with the internet when it was new.. big corporations like AOL got people connected to their controlled, walled garden of internet-connected services.. people got familiar with it and then eventually headed for the door when they realized there's a free and open internet out there, not controlled by AOL, just waiting for them to join and use as they see fit. And they did.
Give it some time and the people will be heading for the UBS blockchain door and joining the *real* blockchain. The free and open one. Bitcoin.
The people's blockchain.

Sorry, I don't and that is because FinCen regulations require any and all financial businesses that interfaces with USD to follow all AML and KYC rules. Period. You will never find a service that exchanges USD that does not require all the red tape. It's the law and the penalties for violating it are severe. I used to use coinbase for purchasing bitcoin but now I use Mycelium to trade locally. They have made it a real pain to have any amount of financial privacy but it *is* possible. Once your money is in bitcoin, however, it can move as fast as you want it to. It's not until it tries to interface with dollars that it hits a wall of bureaucracy where transactions takes days or weeks. Bitcoin is wicked fast. You can send a penny or a billion dollars to anyone on earth in about 20 seconds. That's why I put as much of my money into it as I can. Sorry, I digress.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:45:44
Circle is a bank, so you can expect all the nonsense and annoyance that you would find at any other bank... plus bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:12:31
I used coinbase for a while and *mostly* had no issues except for on two or three occasions when something went wrong and I was forced to crawl through their nightmare of quasi-support options and got little or no help without blasting them on Twitter and Reddit. But that was a couple years ago.. good luck with getting a) a response b) a solution to your problem. I can only imagine how much worse their policies and support are nowadays.
I buy locally now, using Mycelium. Some people don't like buying in person but I've got a pretty reliable system down with a seller I *generally* trust. It's cheap, easy and completely anonymous.

Pretty cool idea but I don't think this will be practical for most uses until the cost is negligible. $40 for three essentially disposable sticks is much too high but the proof of concept is valuable. I can imagine a paper or cardboard version of this being pretty useful.. if the cost was closer to maybe $1 I could see lots of practical uses for it.

Yeah, I can definitely imagine some good uses for it even at the $12.50 price point but all of these ideas entail paying that premium in exchange for anonymity (ie. when buying contraband or making very large anonymous payments) which is well worth the price for those special tx's IMO but I can't help but see the potential for much broader use if the technology can be made ultra-cheap.. maybe by some sort of 3D-printed circuits on cardboard substrate.. or something like that.

the switch from a single block chain to many will either be intentional and precautionary (the smart thing to do) or it will be the result of a painful fracturing of the dominating block chain at some point in the future. it will either happen smoothly because we realize it is important or it will be born painfully out of the ashes of the singular block chain by some future disaster or revolution. all things are moving in the direction of decentralization now, whether they like it or not. even bitcoin cannot resist that idea and it will die from its own centralization if it goes too far in that direction. we have to steer it *toward* decentralization with every new line of code.

Nonsense. Since Bitcoin cannot be created out of thin air it cannot extend 'credit' to any user. It's not a debt instrument like credit cards are. This is more nonsense from bank-minded people who plan to market their new debt vehicles around blerkchan.. or even around Bitcoin itself in this case.. but its still nonsense. On the other hand, I could see Bitcoin being the catalyst for making people reject the idea of debt altogether, eliminating credit cards rather than replacing them... however unlikely that may be. Afterall, people love to feel like theyre getting money for nothin.. but they wont need Bitcoin for that.

Also, the recent de-criminalization of certain drugs, cannabis mostly, has made purchasing things like pot via dark web sites much more unnecessary than just a few years ago, thats where all the bitcoin-for-drugs tx take place. I learned about Bitcoin back in the day because I wanted to use Silk Road .. but nowadays I dont have to because lawmakers are beginning to take their heads out of their asses with regard to drugs and I am no longer labelled a criminal for it.

It basically uses a combination of multisig escrow contracts and small security deposits to de-incentivize fraud and then there are arbitrators on the network to be used as a sort of last resort but the rules seem to work well for eliminating the incentive for fraud. its a 100% decentralized P2P network so you never give your btc to any service to hold for you.

Thanks! Well, like I said, this was made a few years ago so I have to sort of guess at what my intentions were at the time but I would guess that it was a readability decision of some sort.. very small fractions of a bitcoin tend to be represented by very long numbers with lots of leading zeros. Im guessing but it sounds reasonable.
The thing I found interesting looking at it now is that I never before had seen these "NULL" transactions that seem to be rather common now. In the TX data they are all 0 BTC with "null" in the address column instead of listing a valid bitcoin address. Very strange. Its cool to see all the new segwit addresses too. Glad I re-visited this thing :)

No, in fact it is strongly recommended that, rather than use their web site online to generate keys, you can download the web site to your local machine (see the GitHub Repository link at the bottom of the page) and generate your keys locally instead... preferably while disconnected from the internet so you are sure nobody is spying on you.

Yes, a multisig spend transaction can have as many outputs as you like however, there is no way within the multisig itself to enforce the percentage or amount that is allowed to go to each address, so that part you will need to handle programmatically. But the short answer is definitely yes.

You will be notified of the TX the moment it is broadcast to the mempool, not once it has confirmed, so if he sent the money you should already know about it even if it is not confirmed yet.. but yes, you should definitely wait until it is confirmed.

I can only speak from my own experience, having only been using bitcoin since 2012 (when the price was around $6), but I would say that the vast majority of loss occurs by user error (forgetting pass phrases and losing keys) .. the next most common complaint it would seem is loss from online wallet services (including exchanges) closing, collapsing or just plain stealing everyone's keys ... the next most common complaint category comes from direct hacking attacks on wallets.. I can tell you without any uncertainty that foremost in this category is smartphone apps. Seems like several times per day, on reddit alone in fact, you will hear complaints of smart phone wallets being picked. On occasion I do hear about PC wallets being picked but more often than not it actually ends up not being stolen, but lost (more user error).
I don't know what your source is, but mine is my own personal experience of spending nearly every day of the last 2 years using, spending, coding, researching and sometimes educating about bitcoin. The VERY LAST place I will ever put keys to my bitcoins is on a smart phone. The second to last place would be a Windows PC, the best place is completely offline (for large amounts, savings) and then some spending money in an online wallet with 2FA that you trust and an app for smartphone spending/receiving (but the keys are not stored on the phone). I use Blockchain.info for that and only ever keep an amount that would not break me if lost.
Smart phones are safe? Yikes. That sort of belief will end up costing you... just ask the OP

Persistence, as it pertains technically to the blockchain, is in fact the very heart of what Bitcoin is. It is a distributed database. So, the 'persistence of money' can be directly translated to 'money in a database' ... and this is the essence of what bitcoin the currency is in absolute terms.

well the important part is that you make your own rules up that make sense to you and are easy for you to remember...
...but to answer your question, in this example passphrase my rule was basically very simple ... all caps except for the last letter .. i tend to relate the pipe | with an "i" .. but, like I said before .. as long as it makes sense to you it really doesn't matter which characters or where.. 
after you practice with a few different passphrases it quickly starts to be pretty natural to replace letters in your own unique way.

    Florida, Virginia, Kansas, Texas, California, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, Washington
I could recite this list in my sleep. Again, a seemingly random list of common terms.. now we're using states... but the order is not random, it is only known by ME (and my bro-in-law I guess, if he thought about it)
Ok, here are three simple rules that are easy for me to remember:
1 States are abbreviated, first letter is CAP, second letter is special (FL becomes F| .. CA becomes C@ ..etc)
2 Between each state, the direction we traveled is indicated in LOWERCASE (n,s,e,w)
3 Encapsulate the whole thing within pound signs #
 
 
    
It's very easy for me to remember that from Florida .. "F|" ... we drove north... "n" .. to Virginia... "V and then west ... "w" ... to Kansas ... "K$" ... etc ..etc..
Again, this is a short example. The longer the better.
The most important thing is that the underlying list of terms is something impossible for you to forget for the rest of your life. Something unique to you and you only.
The rest is just remembering your rules by which you obfuscate and/or separate the terms.
Easy peasy

Yes, I am gaining anonymity and ease in my transactions. I gain tremendous satisfaction by operating outside of the current banking and payment systems both for ideological and general enthusiast reasons. I don't purchase online anymore unless I can use Bitcoin, something that is getting easier and easier every day. I believe in using Bitcoin. I have an amount that I keep in savings, everything else is meant to spend. I figure why spend dollars? I don't support what they represent even one little bit. I will spend bitcoin instead. The only thing that will ever give Bitcoin value is people *using* it.

Coinbase may still be a solution for you. For a while I was Level2 (or 3?) verfied so that I could buy instantly and all during that time I never had an issue buying. After I removed my card from the account I was lowered down one level and so I started having to wait a week for purchases to complete, which was fine with me, these purchases are for savings only and i don't need them instantly. Now, after four or five purchases at this level, this 'risky email' thing happens. I tend to feel like if I were still able to buy instantly I probably wouldn't have had this issue.. but I still view this as being forced, whether intentionally or not, into providing something I decided that I don't want to (my card) not only to be able to buy instantly... but to be able to buy at all, it would seem.
I guess it just seems like the relationship is becoming abusive and they won't even tell me what the goddamn rules are to their game. So I'm gonna try Circle, which came to my rescue today. They may end up doing the same thing.. who knows?

There is no such thing as a decentralized exchange that exchanges fiat. Fiat comes from banks and they are not decentralized. The closest thing you will find is something like Ripple, which is not decentralized but will let you move between crypto and fiat.

Well real groceries are not currently buyable in my area either. For a short while eGifter was selling walmart cards for bitcoin, and walmart has a massive grocery store in it, so that was completely awesome for a while there buying all my day to day necessities with bitcoin. But walmart stopped allowing 3rd party gift cards so now the closest thing to a grocery store I can use my bitcoins to shop at is a CVS, also via egifter. So my groceries are bought with USD for now, but only until the very moment a grocery store around here starts accepting bitcoin.

Ok here it is, cheap and effective...
Get a friend involved, dress well and the two of you find places where affluent folks mingle and hang out there, maybe a bar/lounge located in the lobby of a fancy pants hotel, etc, and start talking loudly enough for those around you to eavesdrop on about how much money you're making using Bitcoin and why you love it so much. Make those people want to interrupt and ask you about Bitcoin. Its kinda like fishing .. in style.

Well, mining Bitcoin is not something you just do with your spare cycles. It is a serious business with serious competition these days. Maybe you could mine some Doge? In any case, start with a Scrypt-based currency (Litecoin, Doge, etc). Bitcoin is SHA256 and is pretty much ASIC only now. Scrypt is headed that way too unfortunately.

Bitcoin is only regulated by its code. Governments can only attempt to regulate how their citizens and businesses USE bitcoin, but bitcoin itself cannot be regulated by anything outside of the bitcoin source code.
They can regulate you.. but they cannot regulate bitcoin. This is not a case of semantics either. It is a very relevant distinction to be made clear.
I wish that anyone who writes about 'regulating bitcoin' would explain this important distinction in their shitty blog posts and maybe even use the correct phrasing to stop misleading their readers.

True. I have that same cough.
Yeah, I was checking Mycelium earlier and the average price looked to be about a $10 markup. In my opinion, with the way the price fluctuates, it doesn't seem like it's that big of a markup really.. and since it is private and anonymous, for me there actually is some value being added to the purchase that tends toward justifying the added expense.

Wealth inequality is about much more than simply, "I have X amount of wealth and you have Y amount of wealth" .. wealth inequality is an inherent feature of the current global financial system in that there are rules that control who is allowed to attain wealth and who isn't. That is what bitcoin fixes. People want so badly to simplify it down to who has more money than who, but that is only a *symptom* of wealth inequality. It's not about bank account equality (we all have equal money) its about PEOPLE equality (we are all *allowed* to to have equal money). In the current financial system, real wealth is not even an option for most people.

Multibit uses .key files for exported keys. I wouldn't guess there should be a difference in format between OS's because the .key file is merely a text file that contains the private key(s). In fact, you might want to try this, I know this works when importing into Multibit. Create a blank text file, paste in a private key, save as [your-filename].key and try importing that. I've done this a few times .. it's how I access funds within a brain wallet.

That's my point exactly. All speculation is fantasy. Sometimes fantasy proves true, but it doesn't mean it was any less fantastic to predict.

They didn't steal it.. you gave it to them.. and then someone else stole it from them, or they could have stolen it from you as you were transmitting it to Coinbase.

The Bitcoin community, in general, is much less altruistic than it used to be but that is just a sign of wider adoption.

I understand all of that. They have to follow their regulations, but this purchase was submitted last Friday morning. At that very moment Coinbase had all the transaction details they could possibly need in order to make a determination about the 'riskiness' of the purchase request right then and there. Their 'risk-bot' could have immediately notified me of whatever issue they detected with my purchase request.
Instead, Coinbase waited idly for the entire week to elapse and when it was time to give me the bitcoin I purchased from them last week, they cancelled the order.. like it was just some game we were playing. A game they control and won't tell me what the rules are. I don't like that.

I guess it's only a problem if the amount required to establish trust represents a substantial amount of bitcoin. How much burned bitcoin does it take for me to trust that a stranger has a financial incentive not to defraud me? Is $20 worth of bitcoin enough to establish trust? $100? 1 Bitcoin? 2? If trust costs a bitcoin.. or half a bitcoin, not very many will be left spendable on the block chain after a while. Does PoB basically operate around the concept that the more bitcoin that are burned the more valuable the remaining bitcoins become (so burning is no big deal)? Also, this sort of trust scheme seems like it may work mostly for people who are not wealthy but a wealthy person could burn quite a bit of bitcoin to gain whatever trust they need to wreak whatever havoc they happen to desire wreaking. There must be a better way to establish trust without destroying money. Some people find it much easier to destroy money than others.

It defintiely could be like that, so far as the underlying workings of how a multisig address go.. how it is actually being handled in the code.. you may be right, I don't know enough about it to confirm or deny that. All I can really attest to is how this particular multisig tool works (the one at  When you use that tool to create a multisig address, you just give it M keys, and you tell it how many of those keys N you want to be required to sign a transaction. So, with my 4-of-4 example, it ends up looking like there only 4 keys (the ones you specify) .. it may very well generate 3 "lost" keys in the background though.. to satisfy whatever mathematics it needs to.

"Weight it" by "How hard" each step is. Sounds pretty scientific, bud. Yeah that's cute, make sure you use your hard-o-meter to get the right measurement Mr wizard.
Note: *not your hardon-meter ... that's a different tool*
The only facts you have are these: 1) OP's cel phone number was compromised. 2) OP's blockchain account is being fished
The evidence speaks for itself.. we don't have to fondle each other to imagine what a hacker might think or do or find easy or hard. Those aren't facts. Those are your stupid ideas.

Spending bitcoin makes the entire network more valuable. Spend bitcoin as often as you possibly can. Save some, yes, but try to spend whenever you can and send the change to a savings address. It helps every single aspect of the network and adds value.

I understand how you are thinking but I don't agree with your model or interpretation of what an app is. An app is not simply a use case, regardless of how much sense a use case makes. If it suddenly makes more sense to pay my rent with bitcoin, that isn't an app either.. it's a use case for bitcoin the currency app. Xbox is not a bitcoin app. It's a service who accepts currency for payment.. and now they accept bitcoin as a currency. Overstock.com is not a bitcoin app either. Same goes for any service that accepts bitcoin.

It's actually closer to trying to regulate the sun. Governments can have no effect whatsoever on the operation or existence of the sun, but they can regulate *their citizens'* use of it. They can create laws about how many hours each of *their citizens* is allowed to be in the sun. They can regulate the ways and methods employed by *their citizens* who interact with the sun. They can create complex systems designed to monitor and punish illicit use of the sun by *their citizens*. They can even impose a 'sun tax' on *their citizens*.
But they can't regulate the sun.

The public key for your address is *never* a secret. It can be seen on the block chain by all who want to see it. You can see a list of every single bitcoin address that is holding funds. There's a URL for doing that somewhere.. look for it.
The rule about using a new address for each transaction goes mostly for spending bitcoin as far as it's privacy implications but your cold storage wallet address can receive funds as often as you like and it does nothing to further expose the public address.
If you want the contributing addresses to be hidden, send them through a mixer to your cold storage.
...here is a web page that tracks the top 100 richest addresses: 
You can bet that most (if not all) of those addresses are cold storage addresses. Anyone can see them but nobody typically knows who they belong to of course.

I left coinbase for similar reasons but over there it was much worse in that they will make you wait a whole week before you find out they are cancelling your bitcoin purchase. With this issue now at Circle there is at least no expectation that the process is working when it actually isn't. I mean at least I know what happened immediately even if I have no idea why it's happening.
To me all of this is simply an opportunity to finally get much more familiar with peer-to-peer buying methods like Mycelium. I don't think it would take much time at all to figure out a practical solution to buying bitcoins without relying on any of these big 'Bitcoin Banks'.
Anonymity and privacy are becoming more important now too.

I think the trade value was being artificially inflated well before it ever reached into the hundreds even. I think if Gox had never manipulated the price it would have peaked somewhere closer to $2-300 rather than $1200. I was trading before it ever hit $10 so I got to watch the big run up and I had a strong intuition that it was all pretty much fake but, I was getting rich and I never traded at Gox myself so I honestly didn't care what they were doing over there.
Once the price corrected, it settled into a range that was more proportionate to that $1200 high-water mark (which imo was fake to begin with).. in reality it should have returned to a much lower value.. but you know.. markets run on emotions and nobody wanted to see that much value lost.
BTW .. While I do think that bitcoin is currently over-priced, I'm not suggesting that I want to see it drop to wherever it should be. I'd rather see it defy all common sense and go lunar... but honestly it doesnt matter too much to me either way.
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:29:53

Any server out on the internet that is holding your private keys can, potentially, be broken into and your keys (and coins along with them) stolen. That being said, I tend to think that there is a certain value to be placed on convenience, so I use what I consider to be a secure web wallet (blockchain.info, but coinbase is good too) to hold an amount of bitcoin that would be acceptable to lose, if lost in the most unlikely of circumstances. That money is for spending and tipping and etc.. I have a separate savings address where I keep all of my main holdings. Only I know where and only I have the keys to that.
I think you're safe to hold money at coinbase or blockchain. But not for long term storage or savings. Keep your spending money there and use their awesome android apps to beam money around the world.

Bradley Nowell's dalmatian was Lou Dog... and I almost named him that... but I wanted an original name... so I named him after Bradley's biggest musical influence .. Bob Marley... So I call him Marley Dog.
Then that book or movie or whatever came along and so now everybody names their dog Marley and assumes I did for the same reason too, which is mildly annoying. Marley is older than that book/movie though.

You are mistakenly assuming that my bank is like your bank, which it isn't. The bank that I use is a local CU and does not charge anything for ACH transfers.. or anything else for that matter, other than things like overdrafts. You should find a better bank and then you too can enjoy buying bitcoins instantly from Coinbase for a 1% fee. Jesus? Never met him. I met Santa Claus once when I was very little though.. basically the same guy.

I never intend to move my BTC back into USD. My savings addresses and the related keys are known only by me. I run my purchase transactions through a mixer. I am now as invisible in my financial dealings online as I have ever hoped I could be. People like me will never be audited because there literally is no trail to follow. In the near future the average Bitcoin user will be easily as savy as I am now.. and then some. Just watch.
I think many people have this "don't piss off the governement until Bitcoin is legitimized!", attitude and I don't follow that line of thinking. Bitcoin is legitimized by its own virtues. Regulations pertain to fiat money. Bitcoin is outside of it all.

The question is not whether altcoins are related to bitcoins .. the question is whether each domain is related to altcoins or bitcoins.

The term trillionaire is meant in terms of USD value. The US dollar is eventually going to be worth less than the ink used to print them.

I have a bit of experience dealing with homeless people and, at least in this area, almost all of them carry at least one smart phone. Maybe stolen or whatever.. but it's more important to them than most every other item they have. They get free wifi and charging power at many places, including public libraries.
From my perspective it is you who are the truly ignorant one here. The idea is a very good one. Bitcoin is far more useful and practical for homeless people than it is for you.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:30:51
You can generate virtually any type of address imaginable using that tool. Use it while offline and on a machine or device that you know is clean of all malware/key-loggers. I recommend creating either a brain wallet or a paper wallet if you prefer. Once generated you can send funds to the public key address any time after.
People say 'brain wallets are stupid because if you die your bitcoins are lost!' .. but they are not considering the fact that you can have a multi-brain wallet.. where you and your spouse or other family members know the passkey too.

I think that's mostly because the population of earth is waking up to the bullshit all around us and the pope wants to remain relevant, but it's all lies, it's always been an empire of lies, ever since the beginning of the Catholic church when it was invented as a control mechanism for men in power.

I would suggest that you forget about college and do all your learning online. A degree is just a piece of paper that proves you paid too much money for your knowledge. Unless your goal is to become a doctor or a lawyer or you have some lofty career goal in a highly regulated field.. college is not necessary. This is particularly true of the technology sector where experience and a portfolio trump all else.
There are so many excellent and free online schools nowadays that college just seems like a fashion statement more than anything. Like I said, unless you are gonna be a doctor..

Anyone can use Bitcoin for any purpose they like, including governments, but the power of the USD is in the central bank's ability to manipulate it at will. Bitcoin cannot be manipulated by anyone, so it would not grant governments the same power as a fiat currency. It grants everyone equal power. Real money! ;)

Old paradigms die hard, especially when businesses with a stake in the old paradigm mislead people into thinking they are progressing when, in fact, they are luring them right back into the same old paradigm. You're right, of course, this is all just part of the evolution of the technology. Just as people used cd's to hold their mp3's for a while, they will continue to take a purely peer-to-peer currency.. and willingly inject counter-party risk back into it. I find this to be madness and proof of a fundamental misunderstanding of what bitcoin is. Can't we just for once do things the right goddamn way? *-sigh-*

Government believes that it will be easier to goat uneducated consumers into using services if they have a funny name .. like Google .. Twitter .. etc.. Ripple is an IOU system based on the Ripple coin XRP which is a  a top-down, centrally controlled currency, just like fiat, that banks and governments would love for people to think is related to Bitcoin but it is **not**. It is controlled by them, it can be inflated (and recently was) just like regular shit fiat currency. It's completely unbelievable that anyone in the bitcoin space even talks about Ripple.

In ideological terms I value bitcoin for it's libertarian and anarchic virtues. I despise authoritarian control of my finances. In technological terms, and as a programmer, I value bitcoin for it's genius as it is a brilliant invention that will revolutionize society in league with other inventions such as electricity and indoor plumbing. In practical terms I value bitcoin for it's ease and speed of use, reliability, security and financial privacy implications, among many other things. In terms of USD I value bitcoin as a desperately needed alternative and an inevitable successor.
I've bought bitcoins for as little as $7 usd and for as much $800 usd and all prices in between and they have all been worth the same to me. 1 BTC

Interesting perspectives. I still like my idea better. I suppose that is to be expected. :)
The irony here is actually that I pretty much despise all commercial marketing and haven't watched or owned a television in almost five years now for largely this reason, though not entirely. On the other hand I've also worked for what was, at the time at least, the second largest advertising agency in the country for a couple years back in 2000, [Deutsche]( and got to sit in on creative meetings with some of the most brilliant ad people in the business. In the end though, regardless of the artistry that really does exist in commercial marketing industry, it is all just mental propaganda and is to be avoided.

Since bitcoin value is expressed in terms of USD it makes sense that, as the USD drops, a btc will be worth more of them.. so some of the recent rise in BTC price could actually just be a reflection of the USD going down.

I'm glad somebody else thinks in these directions.

if volatility is an issue, dont hold bitcoin for a month before you plan to spend it. even with the limited amount of services available now, its entirely possible to buy bitcoin and spend them all within a minute to avoid any potential change in value. if you're going to hold onto them as an investment... hold longer than a month. its all up to you and your own personal requirements.
i just realized you said you get paid in bitcoin. if that's the case then i would recommend not getting paid *entirely* in bitcoin.. and what you do get in bitcoin, put it into long term savings or spend it shortly.

Taxes? Are you talking about sales tax? All purchase transactions are actually in USD, you understand that, right? Bitcoin is used to perform the transaction, tax and all. If you mean property tax then you are talking about extremely large purchases and while that doesn't actually pertain to me, I'm confident that I could easily remain anonymous with something of that nature as well. I think maybe you just don't know how easy it is to be anonymous with your money now. Bitcoin is certainly not anonymous by default, but it certainly is with some knowhow... and in the future it will be easy for idiots too.

wrong. when you spend them, you are spending them. the person you give them to is selling a product. you purchase them by spending currency. you are most certainly NOT selling your currency for product. that simply isn't how currency works, no matter how badly you would like it to, you're just wrong. you are making yourself look more and more moronic by making shit up in your head that you think sounds reasonable, but instead you sound like an idiot whose trying desperately to sound thoughtful.
do spending and selling have similar qualities? perhaps. both are exchanges between people. that's where the similarities end.

If you mean price manipulation with regard to dollar value then yes, but it is the market that is being manipulated. Bitcoin the technology, however, is impervious to manipulation. Nobody can inflate the currency at will or have any arbitrary affect on fungibility.

Putting bitcoin into cold storage is usually a one-off sort of procedure that you generally want to take the time to do right so you can forget about those coins and trust that all is secure. If you cannot be bothered with securing your device before you go to store your coins.. well.. good luck with that I guess.

Here is an example of an easy to remember, impossible to break pass phrase: (a little shorter than optimal, but for example..)
    {B|Ue%WH|Te%B|Ue%B|Ue%S|LVEr%B|ACk%B|LUe%OR
First, start with a subject that is unique to you. I love riding, racing and building bikes. It is very easy for me to remember the last eight bikes I built for myself over the last 15 years. Nobody on earth could guess the sequence of those bikes, but for me it is something I will never forget.
Those bikes were colored:
    Blue, White, Blue, Blue, Silver, Black, Blue, Orange
A seemingly random list of unrelated colors, some repeated, nonsense that is unforgettable to me.
Now some simple rules to apply...
1. Each color starts with CAPs
2. Each color contains one letter that is replaced with a special character
3. Each color ends with a LOWER
4. % is used as a common separator
5. Just for fun, encapsulate the whole thing in {}
    {B|Ue%WH|Te%B|Ue%B|Ue%S|LVEr%B|ACk%B|LUe%OR
This is just a simple example... a real pass phrase should be longer than this.
You can make up whatever rules make sense to you. Keep in mind that repetition is every bit as important as randomness in pass phrase creation. A mixture of randomness and structure make the strongest pass phrases. My current brain wallet pass phrase is over 60 characters long and impossible for me to forget.. and impossible to brute force or dictionary.
...and yes, if I die .. those bitcoins go bye bye. I'm gonna set something up soon though for that scenario... maybe some sort of Ethereum contract...

hmmm... well that's pretty strange. I would not expect blockchain to have any issues moving those bitcoins. You may need to contact their support. The funds are not unconfirmed, that much is certain. If their site is saying they are, there must be something weird about your account or something. Like I said before though, those bitcoins are safe until you figure this out so you can at least feel at ease on that point.

I, personally, don't do any of those but I do get what you're saying. That's also why credit card companies aren't going anywhere because people will always want credit to purchase things they can't afford to otherwise. I've actually never in my life possessed a credit card, financed any purchase, gotten a loan, etc .. so I really won't need a bank anymore as soon as I am able to be paid in bitcoin, something I'll be comfortable with only once it is accepted as payment method in a few more places, so for now I am still happy being paid in USD by my employer, and this is why I still have a Bank account - direct deposit. The tide is definitely turning though.

Trustless distributed consensus has been achieved for the first time in history. Bitcoin is a discovery in understanding that stands apart from the actual technology or monetary application of it. Even if the internet itself totally disappears tomorrow the answer to the problem of distributed, trustless consensus has been solved and so history, from now on, will leverage the Bitcoin paradigm to distribute power back to the individual.
Yeah, it's gonna fail though.

You could be right, these technologies explode into the future and go in directions we can never anticipate. The internet is an obvious analog in this respect. Regardless of the fate of bitcoin itself, I still feel that the underlying theory and virtues of a block chain-based digital currency is the only hope we have to ever see financial equality. As long as banking cartels control the money supply we will never have it. That much I know for certain. The rest is left up to history.. but the technology is finally here and isn't going anywhere. Will bitcoin do it? That's the promise anyways.

Yep, I agree.... but they obviously want their $18million to be in dollars.. they don't really care one bit about bitcoin per say, they just know that its valuable, there's a market for it, and they can sell it for dollars and then split the booty up amongst themselves.

The IRS taxes INCOME not any specific currency or asset or gains on property. According to the IRS, if you have income, regardless of the currency or asset, you owe tax. The IRS recently chose to classify Bitcoin as property, a type of asset. If you claim to hold Bitcoin to the IRS they will consider the appreciation in value as capital gains income and will want their cut. Bitcoin is only a tax shelter if you keep it hidden, that's how all tax shelters work, by obfuscating your income. There are no stupid questions, only stupid laws.

I agree, and I also really liked the point he made about how, now that the concept of money has finally been introduced to technology and the internet.. that we will see exponential movement toward the same type of 'singularity' that other technologies are all said to be marching toward.. to the point where we really cannot imagine what money will be doing years from now. So the very concept of what money is and does is basically about to go from dinosaur times.. to some unimaginable future. All we have to do is protect the network. Protect the internet. And use tools that support strong anonymity and decentralization.

"vouched for"... that's just an awkward way of saying "trusted"... the whole reason Bitcoin was invented in the first place was to remove the need for trust because trust is always violated.

Here is an example of an easy to remember, virtually impossible to break brain wallet pass phrase: (a little shorter than optimal, but for example..)
    {B|Ue%WH|Te%B|Ue%B|Ue%S|LVEr%B|ACk%B|LUe%OR
First, start with a subject that is unique to you. I love riding, racing and building bikes. It is very easy for me to remember the last eight bikes I built for myself over the last 15 years. Nobody on earth could guess the sequence of those bikes, but for me it is something I will never forget.
...and those bikes were colored:
    Blue, White, Blue, Blue, Silver, Black, Blue, Orange
A seemingly random list of unrelated colors, some repeated, nonsense that is unforgettable to me.
Now some simple rules to apply...
1. Each color starts with CAPs
2. Each color contains one letter that is replaced with a special character
3. Each color ends with a LOWER
4. % is used as a common separator
5. Just for fun, encapsulate the whole thing in {}
    {B|Ue%WH|Te%B|Ue%B|Ue%S|LVEr%B|ACk%B|LUe%OR
This is just a simple example... a real pass phrase should be longer than this.
You can make up whatever rules make sense to you. Keep in mind that repetition is every bit as important as randomness in pass phrase creation. A mixture of randomness and structure make the strongest pass phrases. My current brain wallet pass phrase is over 60 characters long and impossible for me to forget.. and impossible to brute force or dictionary.
...and yes, if I die .. those bitcoins go bye bye. I'm gonna set something up soon though for that scenario... maybe some sort of Ethereum contract... kinda waiting on the whole cryptocurrency landscape to materialize a little more and offer some options for better security measures

its not a bug, its simply a weakness and all weaknesses will be exploited to their highest extent at some point, and this wallet idea brings that time closer. rather than something that can be fixed in the protocol, it is something that must be recognized as a permanent vulnerability during any bitcoin transaction you participate in.. as opposed to kinda just passing it off as something we don't really need to be thinking about. a wallet like this forces the issue, forces people to take responsibility at the occasion of each transaction. in my opinion that is just as critical as addressing code-related weaknesses. knowing the risks.

An intelligent person will educate themselves on proper passphrase selection, and for them there is no more perfect security for their bitcoins than in a brain wallet. True bitcoin security is not yet easy for the lazy or dim witted... but do not fear, there are hardware and software solutions coming online slowly but surely for them too. For instance, the Trezor hardware wallet seems relatively easy and secure, if you can get one... but not as secure as a proper brain wallet. Nothing is.

What I didn't explain, and the part you are missing, is that I was trading long before I began buying every two weeks. I stopped trading at around $200-ish and have since continued to buy 1btc every two weeks.
At one point I actually held more than 100btc and then the Bitfloor fiasco happened and I was a victim of that shitty exchange. After that I had somewhere around 35.. and now every 2 weeks ... +1 ... +1 ... +1 ....+1
I may trade again once there is a decent decentralized exchange online for a while, but that will be crypto-to-crypto.

why not just ask?
you posted some link to a video.. how does that let anybody know you want bitcoin donations?
just .. i dont know .. use your brain and do what seems logical
but remember, in the r/bitcoin subreddit .. your post should pertain to bitcoin.

I'm sure that's true.. but I already got my 1BTC today.. which is sort of the larger point with all this. I don't hold any particularly contemptuous feelings toward Coinbase. Until today I had never had any serious issues with them, although I have heard all the stories so I haven't been ignorant to what other people have experienced either. I think this particular issue is pretty fucked up, but it's just a symptom of a poorly designed system. I'm sure they will improve it and, in the meantime, provide support to the victims of it.. but I would just as soon use an easier service... until this one disappoints too of course ;)

Yes, money has always been the great motivator. The object of the attack is to steal bitcoin so it shouldn't be very hard to understand or at least imagine that the incentives are very high. I think these people would go to much greater lengths than just making phone calls "by hand" if it meant they could log in to your blockchain account and take all your money afterwards.

Even "real" "verified" news stories from "official sources" are bullshit speculative fuel for idiots like you who don't even realize that Bitcoin as an emerging technology does not rely on the price of the currency application of it in order to succeed.

Sorry to say this but you're full of shit. FinCen has no authority to outlaw mixing of digital currency. FinCen legislates money laundering laws as they pertain to USD. Bitcoin isn't even yet seen as a financial instrument, let alone a currency, let alone one that has LAWS governing it. Quit making up your own laws. Mixing of Bitcoin is 100% legal and is going to be a default feature of many new wallets moving forward. Regulate that.

I don't think you do. A bitcoin site becoming compromised? That sounds like another vague suggestion... which 'compromised sites' are you spreading your information around into? That could be your problem right there. Why would you do that? Do you mean that blockchain's site, itself, is compromised? You're reaching for an unlikley answer when the logical one is right there in front of you... yeah yeah .. I know .. you are very uptight about your cel phone security... right.. which is why it happened in the first place I guess. Well .. good luck tracking down that pesky compromised web site.

Who's upset? I didn't lose any bitcoins. I know better. ..and Im saying you're wrong about it being less likely. Mobile phone apps are attack vector number one for bitcoin attacks. Malware on a smart phone takes milliseconds to transmit data to anywhere on the planet, not weeks or months. The fact that their attacker only knows two things about them (they use blockchain &amp; their phone number) implies loudly that this is, yet again, another shady bitcoin app installed on an insecure smart phone.

If the products you buy are priced in USD then USD inflation effects your purchases, whether you pay in dollars, bitcoins or barbie dolls. Inflation effects the economy you are operating in, not necessarily the currency you are using. You could take your bitcoins to another country whose fiat is stronger/weaker and possibly "regain" your bitcions buying power.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:16:39
this would be true were bitcoins constrained by laws of classical physics, general relativity, the speed of light, et al.. as it would take some amount of time, however small, for math to traverse the equation.. however, bitcoins follow the laws of quantum physics and so the two terms are entangled and, as such, are simultaneously indicative of each other.

In bitcoin terms, the confirmation is your assurance that the transaction will not be stopped or reversed.
In credit card terms, the transaction can be stopped or reversed at any time for months and months.

Ever heard of the USD? It's the world reserve currency and that is mostly because it is the ONLY currency you can buy oil with from OPEC. USD has the market cornered on buying oil.

Ripple recently took a page directly from the FED's playbook and artificially pumped their market cap up by some couple billion dollars by creating billions of new XRP, effectively stealing wealth from all holders of XRP and giving it directly to the founders and chairmen of Ripple.
Kristov Atlas was the only person I heard actually reporting on the massive inflationary theft by Ripple.. watch this episode of Dark News to get more info on it: 
He has since removed Ripple from his market cap chart.. good riddance.

I call bullshit. The purchase is identical to many I made before it. There was nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary about this purchase. However, the price of bitcoin has gone up since I purchased last week, which leads me to believe that the only reason they suddenly, on the day they are supposed to give me my bitcoin, decide not to ... is because the bitcoin is now worth more than I paid.
Did it take 7 days to determine the purchase was 'high risk'?
It wasn't 'high risk' when I made the purchase order a week ago?
Yeah .. it's bullshit. If you ask me, I think it's probably fraudulent.

there are no fake bitcoins but you could, however, order 2X takeout ... when you arrive, pay for the first order and then attempt to pay for the second order immediately after using the same bitcoins (double spend). you sorta have to know what you're doing to attempt this sort of scheme and there is no guarantee it will work.. but you might get a free lunch. in my opinion, the risk associated with not waiting for confirmations is pretty negligible but rest assured, if you do not confirm, people will take advantage of it. Just figure it into your bizness plan

Yes, but bubbles like these are a natural and healthy nascent market anomaly. In terms of stock markets, for instance, Bitcoin should be viewed as being very early in it's IPO phase. IPO's in the stock market are regulated so tightly because they can also have extremely volatile swings and lots of risk.. so they keep the public out of the IPO market to "protect" them. We all know, however, that this is just an excuse for their exclusive IPO investor clubs. that you and I are not invited to. You can think of this Bitcoin market as your first ever experience being part of an IPO for a company that will be many times bigger than Apple and Facebook. This is the turbulent part of the ride, but it's all good signs of healthy growth.. not a bubble like you are used to seeing in, say, the housing market where the bubbles are artificially inflated by banks and bad regulations.

Bitcoin is not an organic life form. If it dies, it doesn't stay dead. It comes back from the dead and it comes back better and stronger than ever and with all new capabilities.

Check out BitPay. They remove the volatility by instantly converting to USD for you at the moment of sale. You dont have to hold bitcoin for any amount of time if you don't want to, while still accepting it as payment. Of course, BitPay has their fees. I don't know what they are.

If you need them that quickly and you don't already have a coinbase account ... yeah, localbitcoins might be your best bet. It wont be the cheapest, easiest, or least sketchy way .. but it's the fastest... unless theres a bitcoin ATM within 100 miles of you, if so, drive to that.

@_date: 2014-06-04 09:20:48
The halving does not matter, what matters is that the block chain is governed by an algorithm that is known by everyone.
Every miner knows about the halving, knows exactly when and how it will happen without any doubt or uncertainty and so every miner will make their own decision about how profitable their setup will be and for how long. No miner is ever just chugging along doing their thing and is suddenly shocked by a reward halving. They know all about it well in advance and have prepared for it, each in their own way.
As transaction volume grows, block rewards will be supplemented with transaction fees. Eventually, block rewards will be nothing compared to the constant flood of transaction fees flowing to the miners so eventually they wont hardly notice when the reward halves.

@_date: 2014-05-02 17:13:54
Well, in short, because money must circulate in order to establish value as a currency. Right now the value of a bitcoin is very nearly all according to speculative value at exchange between fiat. The more people and businesses that are using the network for real value transactions between one another, the more inertia there is for further adoption and more widespread use of the protocol. Bitcoin is, after all, the first money ever to exist that embodies the very principal of the network effect ( It is as powerful as however many people are using it. The value of Bitcoin is directly related to the power of the Bitcoin network's network effect, and that is increased by people using it as much as they possibly can, using it because it's awesome! It's faster, more secure, more private. Just use it and help other people use it and the future is golden.

yep. in any case. all these hodlers are the least to worry. even after a successful 51% attack, when the smoke clears and the damage has been done, any bitcoins that were sitting in the blockchain will still be there for whichever fork or patched/fixed/new? version of the blockchain emerges from the ashes. a 51% attack cannot take your bitcoins away. it can drive the value down, sure, by generating buttloads of FUD but your coins are protected by encryption and cannot be taken.

With fine art, the market price is determined at auction... because the auction is the market. Not so with Bitcoin. In fact, with this particular auction several of the bidders literally own and operate their own Bitcoin markets. These are not people who couldn't otherwise procure large amounts of bitcoin anyways. This is simply a chance for them to save a few bucks doing it.
Coinbase, for instance, can buy bitcoins below market value all day long from its customers who are selling bitcoins back to them for USD. They're not going to over-pay for bitcoins. That's just not what they do. Will other bidders want to pay more than they're worth? I suppose anything is possible but it wouldn't follow logic.

Pretty sure? Can you prove that? Did you know that with the most advanced technology we have, we can only detect less than 1% of all potential earth-threatening objects in the sky? Much less than 1% in fact. Most large asteroid flybys are only detected a short time before they pass. Given the difficulty and cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin I would say that the asteroid scenario is perhaps more probable. It could happen right now.
Or right now...
I doubt you could say the same about a 51% attack. I mean you could say it.. I just don't think it would be true or accurate.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:51:23

Certainly. If attempting a double spend was a simple option to select any time you are sending money from a popular wallet, even relatively honest people would no doubt use the option when it suited their needs. They'd never admit to it, of course.. but then you live in a world where a double spend becomes pretty much a certainty once the technology is widely adopted.
I agree that it's a good idea to develop a wallet like this. Expose all weaknesses now, not later.

I hear you. I don't know if you remember an exchange called Bitfloor a while back. I traded there for a while and was caught off guard when their exchange also suddenly shut down. In this case it was the USD that was trapped in their accounts. It took months and months and months of stomach-turning patience and pressure from everyone affected before we finally got all our money back. I never thought it would end well, but thankfully I was wrong. I haven't traded or trusted my bitcoins to a third party ever since. I will trade again once a practical decentralized exchange solution comes into being. I hope we're all wrong about Gox too. Hold onto hope!

I use coinbase to purchase bitcoin... but you can buy them on any exchange, just move them out immediately. If you are immediately barred from moving bitcoin that you just bought... well that exchange is violating you. When I buy bitcoin I send them immediately through a mixer and output either to my brain wallet for savings, or my 'spending money' wallet on blockchain.info which generally holds &lt; $1000 worth of btc. As for trading, I have completely stopped trading until a decent decentralized system is in place... there are a bunch in beta right now.

The IRS not only doesn't have a Bitcoin radar, they also have no idea how to build one. They don't even understand Bitcoin, that much is evident by their recent fumblings in attempting to classify it. Next year they will reclassify it.. and then probably again in 2016.. and so on until they come across something that starts to resemble a working understanding of what it is. Capital gains... I have no record of ever buying or selling (or spending more than a few hundred worth of) Bitcoin. And good luck to you too.

I was aware of the Zinc-pay chrome plugin ... which I've used on amazon before ... but this time it was not enabled for the item I wanted. What's the easiest way you know to purchase with bitcoin on amazon?
Luckily, price isn't really the biggest concern for me. I have bitcoins and I like to spend them so it usually comes down to which route is just easier. Newegg's checkout is fast and easy, so I went with that.

I just had a great promotional idea for your restaurant!
It doesn't really pertain to the ATM, but that's what got me thinking about it.
   Okay, fortune cookies, right? They tend to have loto numbers on them now. Instead of loto numbers, BITCOIN ADDRESSES! (actually might need to be a private key)
   Have a kiosk with a blockchain explorer on it that customers pass on their way out the door and they can check their Bitcoin fortune to see if they win any money. Not alot, a dollar or two. Most addresses will come up empty.
I think it would be good for business and also Bitcoin.

    "Hi dad how was the flight? Going shopping. Need bitcoin!"
    MAN quickly opens bitcoin wallet app and sends bitcoins. MAN turns to WOMAN and smiles.

Yes, I think we're pitching two different commercials and that's fine because there are many different ways to approach marketing. Many different ideas. One approach is to focus on get your message out to people. This is what you're going for and that's one way to go and it can be an effective method of marketing. Another very effective marketing idea is simply about getting a person to engage with their emotions, for any reason and by any means ... scare them, make them laugh, make them excited, make them feel good or anything emotional at all .. and then insert your name/logo deep into their head while you have access. This works exceptionally well for building brand recognition. That is the purpose of my idea. The whole commercial is essentially just a bitcoin logo. One that makes you pay attention.

@_date: 2014-05-15 22:10:49
It's not bad for bitcoin. It's bad for you. You are treating bitcoin like whatever shitty old money you used to use and understand. You want bitcoin to resemble something more familiar to you, which is understandable, just like keeping mp3s on a cd.. its easy to understand why somebody would prefer to keep using old reliable methods and technologies they are used to using even once a far superior technology exists to replace it or renders it obsolete. centralized financial services are becoming obsolete. grok that. and there will most certainly be businessmen who take advantage of people who simply just dont understand what they're doing. who don't understand the real implications of an emerging technology like bitcoin. stop letting other people manage your money for you. its the whole promise of bitcoin. trampled underfoot by businesses like this

I was only able to get about half of my shopping done last year with bitcoin.. to be honest, the usd conversion rate doesn't really factor into the equation too much for me.. the big deal this year really was amazon.com.. neither gyft nor egifter had amazon cards last year when I did my xmas shopping. egifter had walmart cards but then didn't.. then they did.. then they didn't (and still don't).. just in time for xmas.
I find myself preferring egifter over gyft.. but gift has Target cards, which is almost as good as a walmart card because I can buy groceries at Target.. which is cool.
I don't pay for anything online anymore with my bank/cc cards... except for bills... which will probably be the case for a while I suppose. Oh well..
This xmas is already a good one .. because bitcoin :)

It's true, and all those laws and rules and regulations and expectations that they are subject to are simply examples of a failed paradigm's attempt at manufacturing some semblance of trust in a system where trust is impossible. Luckily for us, Bitcoin completely removes the need to trust anyone or anything other than the blockchain. Every ten minutes it gives a new block that we can trust.

that's exactly what my original idea was .. semi trucks to represent big transactions .. motorcycles for micro transactions.. etc.. and I still may attempt it but it really just came down to a question of how much programming I felt like doing .. or didn't feel like doing haha. Also, it turns out that when the block chain gets busy in the middle of the day the traffic is heavy enough that it slows waaaay down .. even with only drawing the head/brake-lights .. so drawing the vehicles themselves would magnify this effect .. I actually had to seperate the roadways into their own canvas to reduce some of the drawing being done per-frame.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:23:21
which one?
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:30:22
It's not a good argument because network effect is not the sole factor in determining success.
Bitcoin isnt just another fiat money .. it is light years beyond and better than fiat.. that's why it will succeed. The network effect will simply make sure that its success is exponential.
Alt coins do not necessarily offer any significant benefits over bitcoin so to present their relationship to bitcoin as comparable to that of bitcoins relationship to fiat ... is ridiculous.

There is much greater security than a single brain wallet. Not only would an attacker need to crack seven individual keys, they would be required to test every conceivable combination of seven keys *as they are being guessed* since the address requires signing by all of them, and in particular order. So the easy answer is yes, it is *still* essentially a brain wallet.. but the difficulty in breaking it is exponentially higher than a single brain wallet.

Yes, a compromised computer would be how a person can steal your private key when you sweep it. The odds may well be very small that it would ever happen but the point of a paper wallet (and offline "cold" storage in general) is to allow you to be *completely positive* that your private keys have *never* even had the chance to be exposed to any potentially compromised system and, thus, could not have been compromised. The moment you use that private key on any internet-connected device.. you cannot be certain of that key's security anymore.

There are many mixing services on the internet. In fact, Blockchain.info has a mixing service called 'shared coins' available to all their users. Any time you send coins anywhere you can send them through a mixer to whatever address you'd like and it makes tracing those coins back to you extremely difficult. I recommend doing some research about mixers now that you have heard of such a thing.

The items you are purchasing are priced in USD .. so it doesnt matter what you pay with, bitcoin, dollars or dog turds.. your buying power is reduced because you are paying a USD price that is subject to inflation. Inflation effects the economy, it effects how much things cost, not necessarily the value of the currencies being used within the economy.

You can bet that any regulations that are 'eased' have only to do with laundering at a very high institutional level and would likely serve to actually *tighten* KYC and AML requirements at all other levels of finance.

I just think it's useful to recognize the exponential rate and pace of adoption for *all* new technologies in today's world, compounded by the actual utility of each new technology and the demand therefor.. and, arguably, there is no more universally utilitarian and desperately needed technology than one that improves upon the concept of money and trust, especially on a global scale like with Bitcoin.
There will be a tipping point where ubiquity happens virtually overnight. When that point is reached is really the basis of the prediction. I think much sooner than anyone predicts .. Nowadays, I think 10 years is practically a lifetime in terms of technology.
I think in 20 years there will exist a whole new generation of kids who have no real understanding of how money used to work back in the 'old days' of central bank supremacy - how all the money in the entire world was controlled and manipulated and gamed by a select few criminal institutions. It will be like learning about the dark ages... and rightfully so.

Yeah, I am thinking about scenarios where, for instance, a single player becomes powerful and has almost enough keys to unlock even more power for himself.. causing the remaining players to form a massive alliance, and they grab the power up. But an alliance will also need to weaken the individual members of it to some degree, making it a calculated risk.
All the politics and strategies that are possible are fun to think about.
I would like for it to be a self-sustaining sort of game that pays for itself.. as in, the players each pay a certain amount to play and all of their money goes into a winner-takes-all trophy reward.

You're right, your full node can reject blocks all day and night while the block chain, made up by the mining nodes, will continue on without you.

Yeah, you know I used to have a PS3 and the online gaming was free and that was great, but then I got an Xbox and they charge for online gaming so I played online during the free trial but ever since it expired I don't play Xbox online because 1) I won't give them my personal financial info and 2) Gaming is not important enough to me to pay for ... BUT now that they accept bitcoin.. I might actually give it a try for a little while... it still makes no sense to me to pay money for game play (I bought the console, I bought the game, I bought the internet connection.. I gotta pay to play too?), but I can ignore that principal for a little while in exchange for supporting real world use of bitcoin.

If bitcoin becomes mainstream enough that everyone is mining bitcoins on their fridge (especially with the intention of spending them), you can also bet that there will be, by that time, plenty of opportunities to *earn* bitcoin working regular jobs and transacting normally as they do now. Adoption will change the game at all levels. Mining will have changed. Spending will have changed. Users' intentions will have changed.. etc

Yes you can but you have to send 100 billion satoshis in a single transaction in order for it to work. Let me know if you need an address to test your attack on.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:35:21
You are assuming that asteroid impacts have a known and predictable rate of occurrence. False. Seven discreet asteroids could hit the Earth over the next 10 years and then not again for another 100 billion. In reality there is not a scientist that has ever lived that would be so bold as to give you any sort of odds on when the next one will be. They would laugh at your estimate and probably louder than I just did. Your economics are way off too. At the current difficulty, the effort required to even attempt a 51% attack, in capital terms, exceeds $500million dollars (see Andreas Antanopoulos' recent key note speech in Canada where he gives more-accurate numbers.. I'm going by memory) and that amount would give you 1 attempt at faking 1 block in the chain. The power you'd inherit from a successful attack (and theres no guarantee you'd succeed) would allow you to double spend some transactions for the next &lt;10 minutes, after which time another attempt would need to be financed, and so on, and so on. The odds of this happening are virtually 0% as there is no economic nor practical purpose for such an expensive attempt at such a weak attack. And Bitcoin would recover quickly. Now it's your turn to laugh, but it's only because you think you understand the blockchain.. but I'm not so sure.
I am kinda enjoying our debate tho :)

If you have the private keys don't worry. That's the only thing you will ever need to get to your bitcoins. You can use any wallet application to access your bitcoins. I havent imported keys into blockchain.info before but I would download Multibit and import your keys into that. It's what I use.
Create a text file, paste your private key into it, save as [your-filename].key .. then go into Multibit and do an import. It will prob need to download the entire blockchain before it is synced and ready, which takes a while, but i know this method works because i do it frequently.

Ripple artificially inflated their market cap by printing billions of new XRP, just like the FED does with dollars, in order to steal wealth from all XRP holders and give it directly to the owners and controllers of Ripple. By doing this they instantly increased their market cap by some several billions of dollars (all held by them of course). Go back about a month or so and you will see a single event where their market cap jumps from down about 10th place for alt coins (they were in a downward trend at the time) to waaaaaaay up past the  spot. They are thieves, liars, scam artists and typical bankers. Steer clear of Ripple. They create value out of thin air just like the banks do, and for all the exact same greedy, despicable reasons. They are the antitheses of Bitcoin. That's why banks love Ripple.. because it's THEM. Bitcoin is here to replace corrupt systems like Ripple.

*All* the votes are held by the miners. They decide which client they will run and support. Holders of bitcoin .. or whatever 'community' you're otherwise referring to.. have nothing to do with making decisions regarding the protocol. The protocol is a collection of nodes that can each decide to run whichever version of bitcoin *they* all agree on.. not you or me. We have no say whatsoever. It's not a democracy unless you are a miner. Miners, for all intents and purposes, *are* the network.

miners can only fit X amount of transactions into a block, so they start with the transactions with larger fees first and work their way down. how long it takes depends on how much traffic there is and how far down in the queue you are with your particular fee.
there will hopefully be some scaling fixes implemented soon that will allow for more transactions to fit inside each block. until then, fees will continue to determine transaction time.

Yes, my hot wallet is where I do regular spending from.. shopping,etc. I like using blockchain.info because you can send payments through their mixer, which will keep the recipient from snooping on your wallet funds, which is good.. but it's not a good enough mix method to trust for anything more important than simple privacy measures. I use their mobile app too, but I also use Mycelium since I am also a local buyer of bitcoins through that app.
The Rush wallets are also 'hot' .. with the added benefit being that you can do your own 'off-chain' transactions by simply handing over control of the URL to whoever you would like to pay.. I keep 1btc/per wallet that way. If I need to make a secret payment I can just give the URL to the recipient and it belongs to them now. No blockchain tx record .. until they move their funds.

bitcoin difficulty has already dropped once. news flash: it will drop again. and again and again. the difficulty correction is a feedback mechanism designed to do exactly what it is doing, responding to the network hash power. if all the miners left the network and the difficult y went back to 1000 i would start mining on my PC again.. and so would everyone else in the world.. bitcoin is a self-correcting system. it will be around until the internet isn't.

My plans for it are as a sort of mobile cold storage. I travel around a lot and I have a lot of bitcoins. I already have a hot wallet that I use regularly but I will move funds from cold storage to my hot wallet maybe once a month or so give or take a week.. but I could be anywhere when I need to do that.. so the trezor, though not used constantly, would still need to be travel-worthy and accessible.
I'm hoping there are some people out there who have similar requirements and have figured out some best practices for keeping a trezor on your person.

Bitcoin was invented so that you may finally rid yourself of these things. Find new ways to achieve your ends. If you're still being charged and defrauded you are not using bitcoin yet.

You can download brainwallet.io from their github and run it locally offline and in a secure browser such as Tor.
They explain this right there on the page: "Brainwallet.io is a self-contained website that can be run offline. We recommend that you download the latest HTML file from GitHub, verify file integrity (checksum) with the PGP-signed changelog, and run it on an air-gapped computer. Keep a copy of the HTML file that you used to generate your brainwallet for safekeeping."

First of all Dr Dangerous, you need to grok the difference between anonymity, which is not what this thread is about, and privacy. Having said that, I believe in promoting privacy as a natural side effect of anonymity and for the bitcoins that I want to be anonymous, yes, I am able to guarantee complete anonymity from the moment they come under my control until the moment they are not. This is not to say that I don't own bitcoins that are only reasonably private, using the methods described earlier, that I use for mundane purposes. I still consider these transactions to be 'private' though not necessarily 'anonymous' if ever the subject of an ultra-powerful quantum computer attack from the future as was suggested before.
You can be as private **or** as anonymous as you want with bitcoin, and you can also be as transparent as you want, and you can be many shades in between. If you cannot attain privacy, it's only because you haven't figured out how yet. Keep wanting it and you'll get it.
Sorry about the Dr Dangerous thing. I just thought that was a funny way to start out. :)

Is that what I'm saying or is that what your puny mind heard?
Value and price are not the same thing. Bitcoin, as a currency, does not rely on a USD conversion price in order to function exactly as it is designed to function. Everything good about bitcoin is still good regardless of how many USDs you guys have convinced yourself you can trade for one.
I know none of this makes sense to you because you'd first have to understand that your USDs are actually the worthless half of the equation. Unfortunately, you'll learn all of this first hand very shortly when all you traders and gamblers start jerking each other off over how many Chinese Renmumbi's or whatever your bitcoins are worth!
And one day, when USDs and other fiats are as valuable as snot, you won't care about anything but how many BTC you have..
and then you'll admit to yourself quietly that I was right.

shopping with gift cards is easy when you use the egifter app. you can shop for groceries and whatnot at target, for instance, and then purchase a gift card while youre in the checkout queue and then they scan it off your phone. it can be faster and smoother than using a debit chip card. it was really nice when egifter used to sell walmart cards because some walmarts have gas pumps and thats the only time i've ever been able to buy gas with bitcoin. but walmart does their own cards now. when i lived mostly on bitcoin i still paid for rent, utilities and gas with usd. hopefully someday soon i can pay for everything with bitcoin

Like I said, I think you should just **buy, spend** and **save** bitcoins.
Do any of those three things as often as you like.
And if you're really good you will figure out how to **earn** bitcoins. That's the holy grail.
But basically, avoid *selling* bitcoins.

I already escalated the support call up to the highest ranking manager that was on hand and none of them can do anything for you, so they say. They are empty sock puppets reading scripted responses to what is obviously a constant support issue for them.
It obviously goes on a lot. They are well trained in their bullshit and will continue repeating it even after you've demonstrated how it doesn't apply to your situation.

I want you to know that I don't hold you entirely responsible for how pathetic and desperate you are feeling and acting right now. To a large degree you can't help it. I totally get that. You're all like 'pleeease pleease validate me!' and as much as it might feel good to give a quick fix to someone who is in need, such as you are, in the end I would only be enabling you. Essentially, I'd be reinforcing your desperate behavior. That wouldn't really be fair to you. What I will do for you is offer you the forgiveness that you will no doubt be seeking once you have lifted yourself out of your pit of despair. I'm totally pulling for you.
Whenever you're feeling desperate, just ask yourself, 'what would bitcoin do?'

They say that when I deposited the $200 that my USD is turned into bitcoin at that price.. but my money never deposited on the 30th.. it disappeared and never came back until today and they say 'Oh! well now its only worth $175!' ... but I never bought anything, I never had anything, no service, no product, no deposit happened.. nothing! Just $25 stolen from my deposit.
And of course they couldn't possibly give less of a shit on the phone.
They have obviously been trained on how to avoid taking responsibility for their errors on the phone, no matter what.

Holding bitcoin is not the same as accepting it as a payment option.

The main issue I see is that blockchain *replaces* financial services with software that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime, free of charge. It will become harder and harder to convince people to hand their money over to any 'financial service' once it is understood that a person can manage all of their own 'services' right out of their wallet app with better privacy and security than any third party can offer.

A callback URL is a URL that you can provide to Coinbase that basically says "every time a transaction happens on this address, send a notification to this URL" .. if you are a web developer, you could write a script that listens for these notifications and lives at the URL.

No. The point of paper wallet is that the private keys NEVER get exposed to any device that is on the internet. By sweeping the address, you have exposed your private keys. That paper wallet is now essentially useless. Make another one.

I wonder, wouldn't it be more accurate to call this new type of service 'decentralized arbitration' rather than 'exchange'? It seems to me that the great innovation being made brilliantly available here is that of the 2-of-3 multisignature escrow addresses. Bitsquare makes these escrow transactions very easy. The exchange itself, however, is done using whatever offline method the parties agree to.
It's just a semantics question but I believe in calling all things by their real name. Regardless, I think the software and idea is fantastic and I can't wait to use it.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by the shared secret. Do you mean the encrypted message? In Bitcoin, the encrypted message is an amount of bitcoin. Your public bitcoin 'address' is your public key. When you 'send' bitcoin from one address to another, what you're actually doing is simply decrypting them using your private key.. and then re-encrypting them using the recipient's public key.. so now they are the only person who can decrypt those bitcoins (using their private key) the bitcoins stay on the blockchain but are now encrypted to another key (another person?)
I may totally misunderstand your question tho..

Sure thing. A brain wallet can be generated using a web-based application. I use  - you can generate brain wallet keys for many different coins there. Use that site to practice creating some brain wallets to get used to how they work. When you are ready to create your real brain wallet keys (to hold your savings) you should download a copy of their web site to your local machine. There's a link on the site to download the entire web site and application from github. The best and most secure practice is to run the application on a freshly installed, never online, not connected, completely OFFLINE and secure laptop. Generate your brain wallet keys, copy down the public key and send your money there. Try to never ever ever ever generate your brain wallet keys on any system that you cannot guarantee is 100% secure and then you can always be certain that your bitcoins are 100% safe from theft.
Oh yeah, one more thing, if you do use blockchain.info ... send your savings through their mixer INTO your brain wallet....(or use another mixing service) to basically unlink your identity from your savings. So nobody but you knows where your savings are.

No, what Im saying is that the reality of the bitcoin network is that it exists entirely as a network of nodes that are absolutely free to use which ever version of bitcoin that they want. If you can't understand that you still have a fuck ton of learning to do regarding how bitcoin works and why voting by anyone who isn't a miner is absolutely pointless because the miners ARE the network and they can do anything they want, regardless of what you or I want them to do. Get it? I doubt it. Maybe watch less tv and read more. Just sayin. You'll start thinking better.
In case you haven't noticed .. centralization of mining is a HUGE problem that is discussed constantly. So yeah, thats right.

I'm not sure if you're intentionally re-wording what I say to be clever or if you simply have difficulty explaining yourself but what I said, to be accurate, is that with legacy banking systems it is impossible to avoid fraud because it is an inherent piece or quality of that system. There is nothing to allow for this type of fraud in the Bitcoin protocol. It's impossible. The rules of the Bitcoin protocol are immutable and so fraud is something that must be invented as a service *on top* of the Bitcoin protocol. You can think of this as legacy banking practices *seeping* over into Bitcoin if it serves you. But no user of Bitcoin is subject to these services in order to use Bitcoin. It is a protocol.

Start an advocate group if its that important to try and speed up adoption beyond its natural rate of progression, I think it's stupid and disingenuous to suggest however. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. It will only become more and more useful and therefore more and more *used* as time elapses. Dumb shit ideas like this, like 'marketing' Bitcoin, is for idiots who care only about their own financial (dollar) stake in the 'value' (dollar) of a bitcoin (little 'b' .. its monetary aspect) and they don't actually give a shit about its fundamentally revolutionary aspects. Their shallow appreciation for Bitcoin is also manifest in their impatience... and patience is all Bitcoin really needs. Unfortunately its the one thing these people don't have.

Listen, we're not talking about anything outside of how the block chain works.. a person who is knowledgeable about maintaining their anonymity **can** do so and still use Bitcoin to transact. This knowledgeable person would **not** use methods of obtaining bitcoins that compromise their anonymity in the first place, but like I said that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the block chain.. not about buying bitcoins or mining bitcoins or any of that. Try to stay on topic

Well, without digressing completely into that subject.. I think we're pretty deep into that territory already.. living according to your principles in 2015 already requires *enormous* will and conviction. There is no such thing as being lazy and virtuous. The majority of people will, in fact, always do the thing that requires the least amount of will and conviction so you will almost always feel alone in your principled position. I'm used to it. For instance, I haven't owned or watched a television for almost a decade now. You wanna talk about a plague on humanity? Look no further. The entire planet is permanently addicted to it and it is so perfectly insidious that they have no idea it's killing them and will fight you to the death to insist otherwise if you mention it. So yes, the vast majority of people will make the wrong decisions even if you don't. Worse still, they won't even care .. even if you do. So long as their TV keeps working what does it matter?

You are correct, the app can be put into "line drawing mode" which allows me to draw bezier-curve path segments. Each segment within a path contains 10 anchor points and a vehicle will travel the entire length of any segment, regardless of the length, in a predetermined amount of time ... SO if I draw a very short segment, this will be a *slow* segment and if the line is very long, the vehicle will appear to move faster in order to traverse the length of the segment in the same amount of time. So if the road is in the distance I draw more segments that are shorter and as the road gets closer to the foreground I draw successively longer segments to follow. Wanna see line drawing mode? Do this: Go to the page and press 'T' to turn off the TX list and then press 'C' to disconnect from the blockchain API so now there should be no cars spawning. Now press 'L' ... you won't see any indication but you are now in "line drawing mode" .. start clicking around on the screen and you'll start to get the basic idea. This is how I draw the paths. Once your path has a few segments, press 'L' again to end the path. Now click anywhere inside the shape you created. It should fill with blue and if you open the console in your browser you will see that it has dumped out all the coords for the entire path in an array. Then I can save the segment as a 'road' to use in the simulation.
Making the cars disappear in order to appear to pass behind other surfaces is a pretty simple matter. Once a path is drawn and saved all its points/segments are stored in a data structure along with other data which define ranges along each segment where the vehicle should not be drawn. As the animation cycles it is first checking each vehicle for whether it should be drawn or not by this data.
Thanks for you questions! Im glad you like it :)

The value of the transaction was entirely just in demonstrating how this thing works, this thing that he's been hearing about here and there. He finally saw what it is. He's a rich dude so he doesn't need the $5 and will prob go buy a big chunk if he buys any at all. He was pretty stoked on it though so I think he will go learn some more and then probably buy some.

Could be as simple as they just never updated their scripting to support mulit-sig addresses. There is really no techinical reason why they would be unable to send transactions to a 3 address.

Yeah I saw they started supporting it but their volume looks super low. When I created a trade the max it would let me convert was like 1 or 2 BCH.

Reporting of income for tax purposes has always been a voluntary process in the US. You, essentially, promise to report your income correctly so that they may calculate their cut of your earnings. Only recently have banks and corporations conspired to track everyone's money to the extent that they "know" how much money you made.. but Bitcoin is returning us to a time when we will have the option to remain completely private with our finances if we so choose, and reporting income for tax purposes will once again be as it always was.. voluntary.

Yep. I didnt know they had an iPhone version but thats cool.
Yes, the wallet has a P2P local buyers/sellers market built into it. You can find people buying and selling bitcoins in your area. It's not the most convenient way to buy and sell but it can be fun and it allows me to stick to my principles by not participating in the corporate banking surveillance industry.. bypassing it entirely.

Install the app, create your user ID, go to the 'Buy/Sell' section of the app, enter a location (city/state/zip/etc) to get a list of buyers/sellers nearby, contact them to initiate a trade ... you can also post an ad of your own to buy or sell bitcoin at your own preferred price and wait for someone to contact you.

I guess it all depends on whats important to you. If you don't mind subjecting yourself to a stringent KYC/AML surveillance platform so that you, your identity and your finances may be tracked, scrutinized and ultimately sold to the highest bidder, then Circle and Coinbase (the big banks of Bitcoin) are certainly the easiest to use once you have been thoroughly identified.
I use Mycelium to buy locally. It's not fast or entirely convenient, but I don't need fast and convenient, I just need my bitcoins to be like good ol anonymous cash.

You can rest absolutely assured that when you broadcast a bitcoin transaction there are only two possible things that can happen ... nothing else is even possible.
A. The funds will go to the new address
B. The funds will stay at the original address
There is no other possibility. It may take a while to confirm or to clear the mempool but in the end these are the ONLY two possible outcomes. Bitcoins cannot disappear or become lost in any way either by accident or intentionally. You can relax!

The encryption algorithm (ECDSA) that protects bitcoin addresses was **not** invented by the creator of Bitcoin. The hashing algorithm (SHA256) used to mine and secure the block chain was also **not** invented by the creator of Bitcoin. Every part of Bitcoin existed well before Bitcoin did. Satoshi Nakamoto's genius was to combine these already existing technologies together.

not necessarily, in fact there is a guy local to me who is an avid miner. he sells bitcoin *below* the current exchange rate.. usually about 2% below .. and he always has a supply. it really depends on who's around and what their motivation is.. but yeah, typically people charge a premium.. but there are usually a few options in the 1-2% markup area. once you've used the service a few times it gets easier to find and make good deals

Regulation is not for Bitcoin itself. The block chain is regulated by its code and nothing else. What governments can regulate are *people* and *businesses* operating within their jurisdictuions. So they may create new regulations for **you** to follow and those regulations may aim to regulate how **you** transact with money in general, crypto or otherwise.. but they can never change how Bitcoin works. That is beyond their reach. So there is no such thing as 'Bitcoin (Crypto) regulation' .. regs are for people and businesses.

Bcuz it's mine, I own it and nobody can ever say otherwise or take it from me or stop me from using it how I like, unlike all other forms of currency in existence. Gold can be confiscated, as it has been countless times in the past and is currently happening in India and Venezuela. Not only can nobody take my bitcoins, you'd be very hard pressed to even locate them or prove they exist.
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:36:07
True that. I was a Coinbase user for quite a long time, ever since their beginning, and it is by far the easiest way to purchase Bitcoin. I just fell out of love with them the more I learned about their aggressive surveillance policies and experienced first hand their horrendous support system on a few too many occasions. They made me realize I was still using a stinkin bank and Bitcoin is the promise of something better. One day it will be.. I think.. heh

My biggest moron moment actually has to do with Ethereum. I was one of the first to purchase Ether at the very beginning. I spent 1BTC and got 2000ETH. I thought I'd play it safe and lock my ETH redeem script up in its own little encrypted volume.. but due to some retarded brain fart I saved the encryption password to a file *inside* the encrypted volume! So I lost access to those ETH as soon as I bought them.
As of right now those ETH are worth $21,940

yep. i used coinbase for about 3 years before i got fed up with their buggy security and virtually non-existent and useless support system. any service where they hold customer funds ought to, in the very least, have some level of decent technical support.

Exponentially greater security: Multisig brainwallet
For instance, I use a 7 of 7 multisig brainwallet address to store my savings.
Each of the seven brainwallet pass phrases are very very easy for me to remember, a few could even be *dangerously* simple,  but an attacker would need to break all seven to move funds and must try every possible combination of seven pass phrases so even if they break one, they won't know it until they break all the rest too.

Ok, first send your bitcoins to a blockchain.info wallet. Use their 'shared send' mixer to send to another *real* mixer, like Darkwallet. The blockchain.info mixer will give you privacy from Coinbase snooping, and the *real* mixer will give you privacy from blockchain.info. I mention using blockchain.info as a mid point because they are a reputable service that Coinbase won't consider questionable. For simple everyday transactions, the blockchain.info mixer might be plenty of privacy, but for anything requiring real anonymity or privacy you should use a *real* P2P mixing service like Darkwallet or JoinMarket.

Coinbase is the easiest IMO but Coinbase tracks your addresses so I wouldn't use them unless you know how to mix your bitcoins or if you don't care about financial privacy.
Buy at Coinbase, send to your Blockchain.info wallet and use their shared coin mixer to create at least some privacy between you and Coinbase .. then, personally, I would even use another real mixing service after that. Blockchain.info's shared mixer is not very powerful.

I don't think you speak for the majority of bitcoin users at all. I know you'd like to *think* that you do, but you actually have no idea what the majority of people think. Privacy and anonymity is one of the best reasons to use Bitcoin at all. If you're going to spread your identity around the internet, why not just use your debit card? You sound like a speculator. People who are into bitcoin for "investment" purposes are always clueless to how the majority of bitcoin users are actually using bitcoin (and have been since 2009) .. as a private, secure and instant form of digital payment. Please, tell me more about what *the majority* thinks... or rather, what you think they think.

In case anybody wants a full sized copy...
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:35:21
Yep, and funny story.. ok not funny, but it's a story...
In 2012 I traded at an exchange based out of NY called Bitfloor. It was actually a really great exchange, good liquidity, a decent trading interface for that time, and NO identity was required whatsoever to set up an account, just an email address. USD deposits were made via cash deposit at Bank of America or Wells Fargo into their account and funds always made it into your trading account within 1 hour. I miss those days.
Anyway, one day Bitfloor suddenly shut down. In the hours leading up to the shut down obviously certain traders were tipped off ahead of time because people started buying bitcoins for waaay above the normal price.. turning their money into bitcoins so they cold get them the hell out of the exchange before it closed. When I saw how high the price was I immediately sold everything I had in that account, about 40btc, which at the time was only about $10k worth I think, maybe less. But then the exchange shut down and so all that USD was stuck in there.
To make a long story short, tons of people were in the same situation as me, it took literally MONTHS and MONTHS to finally get refunded our USD from that exchange.. mostly because NO BANKS would work with a bitcoin exchange, and especially not to help them refund over a million dollars to their customers.
That's when IAFCU stepped up, gave Bitfloor an account, and processed all the refunds for all of the traders so we finally got all of our money back.
Part of that process was that we all had to become IAFCU account holders in order to receive the refunds.
So... YES hehe.. I do have an IAFCU account.. and I do have a debit card with their logo on it. haha
I havent used it much since then tho. But they did seem like a really good bank with good helpful people working there and a very positive attitude toward Bitcoin.
Sorry for the novel.

If the last point is valid than the general point is valid since they are essentially the same thing. Breaking a single brainwallet is a simple and easy brute force procedure, regardless of the length or complexity of your pass phrase. Breaking 7 brain wallets and testing a multisig transaction for each combination of 7 is exponentially more difficult and resource intensive. We can argue all day if you like about who has difficulty grokking the math and technicalities of each scenario.. but I doubt it will be a very interesting or fruitful discussion.

No, because it has no bearing whatsoever on me or how I will be using Bitcoin. It's for financial services operating in NY and their customers. That's what Lawsky's jurisdiction was. Nothing more. Does not affect me at all .. or anyone else who uses bitcoin for personal use for that matter, even in NY. If you use financial services in NY you're an idiot. If you use bitcoin financial service businesses at all, you're doing it wrong. The Bitcoin block chain and a brain is all that's needed now. I say to hell with bitcoin businesses altogether.

Use a small local bank or credit union. I've been banking with M&amp;T Bank in Maryland for a long long time.

I keep a decent amount of BTC in a 7 of 7 multisig address where all seven keys are from brainwallet phrases.

Awesome, thanks for the great info. So then I was correct in my understanding that a multisig address all by itself is not enough to disclose its component keys and/or rules. And it makes sense that, once transacted from, more data can be retrieved from the Tx opcodes. For my savings address, I never share the address with anyone and it's never been spent from so I will rest easy. :)

A single brain wallet can be brute forced more easily than seven brain wallets that all must be simultaneously brute forced *together* and in the correct order.
Every brute force attempt must be an attempt to break *all seven pass phrases* together. The attacker will never know which ones failed or if any of them were broken until *all* of them are broken.
Also, the extra work to test multisig addresses is not insignificant with regard to a brute force attack, where trillions of attempts will be made. Breaking a multisig address takes more cpu, so it will naturally be more costly and difficult for the attacker.

It doesn't matter. I know you really want to care about this, but you have no need to. Unless you are trying to run or use a bitcoin business in NY you can relax. And if you are, you don't get bitcoin in the first place and you have a more fundamental issue.

@_date: 2015-08-06 00:19:39
It varies with the value of a bitcoin which has been as high as 1200 and as low as 0 ... so all those bitcoins mined at 0 were incurring major major losses, basically mining for nothing. when it was 1200 it probably seemed well worth the energy. and now at 300...
satoshi mined a million bitcoins. at the time it probably cost him a few hundred dollars of power.. but they were only worth $0 so that was total loss of capital. now theyre worth a bazillion dollars

No, not at all. I am saying fuck them. I couldn't care less that they will be regulated. In fact they should regulated be if they hold customer funds. Bitlicense has absolutely no bearing on me or most bitcoin users. I don't know why people even care about it other than just to be dramatic about something. It's all but completely meaningless.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:31:38
That's a whole lot of people getting misinformed...
Oh well, Bitcoin will survive this too
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:19:48
That's not using Bitcoin .. its using CoinFox...
"After the payment is made, the teller transfers the equivalent amount in bitcoins into the user’s mobile wallet **for a small transaction fee.** The maximum amount per transaction is limited to **$50 USD.** "
Sounds like a watered down, cheaper Western Union when, in fact, no third party is necessary at all. People are already using bitcoin all by themselves to send money to all corners of the globe. A limit?? On bitcoin?? Haha
When will people realize that the whole point of bitcoin is to *remove and replace* any need for any of the money 'services' that everyone seemingly wants to provide to bitcoin users before everyone realizes they aren't needed.
Bitcoin already *does* international remittances. By default. It knows no 'nations'. You just send. Pretty easy.
You're gonna have to think of new services that didnt already exist because Bitcoin is obsoleting all those old ideas.

You're better off learning how to use bitcoin without Coinbase anyway
Coinbase **is a bank** and they are regulated as one and so they **must act like one** and suspect that all of their customers are criminals, close accounts that they think are suspicious, and generally fuck you in your ass but all in the name of KYC/AML since bitcoin is obviously fraught with money launderers haha

@_date: 2015-08-02 11:30:55
If you want to send money to people who don't yet use or know about Bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin services online allow you to send bitcoin to an email address.. I know Coinbase does this, I'm sure there are more.. the email directs them to create a wallet at their web site which will have the bitcoins waiting for them in it. So they get a little introduction to Bitcoin allong with the tip.

Yes, I've been using myTrezor but I don't use Chrome as a general rule, mostly only Firefox.. and also, I don't really *use* my Trezor all that much to be honest since I use it for medium-to-long term cold storage. Every month or two I may move some bitcoin from Trezor to my hot wallet, but that's about it, but I'm sure there will be a lot more options in the future to use Trezor as a hot or at least 'warm' wallet too. Actually.. I guess it's already pretty warm.. its not really *that* cumbersome to spend from.
For long-term cold storage I just use a multisig address.

Centralized services will always be highly targeted honey-pots. Once again, it is *fiat exchange* that weakens the security model and requires BTC to be held in custodial accounts. Cryptos can be traded P2P so eventually that's how trading will be done. The security issues bitcoin faces right now are due to interfacing with fiat services that must be centralized and regulated by necessity. They are, essentially, required by law to be targets for theft.
Decentralize all the things!

hehe.. so silly.. a block chain is only a solution for open, trustless/permissionless networks.. if your "block chain" implements a trusted entity.. it's not a block chain... in fact, you don't need a block chain.. all you need is a database.. there are many better solutions than a block chain if you don't need your network to be trustless/permissionless.. it's really not that hard to grok.. but i guess maybe it is for some people.
i think maybe they are confusing "block chain" with "block buzz" .. which is great for marketing.

Evolutionary pressure is how systems become anti-fragile. Let them do their worst, any measures to outlaw encryption will be temporary at best, lasting only as long as their totalitarian wet dreams do. They can outlaw math and science if they like. Ultimately, they will fail.
I'm not suggesting, however, that anybody not say fuck the FBI. Fuck them in their misguided assholes.. but their plan will fail and will only serve to harden their target, and to whatever degree they do this I say "Thanks, assholes!"

Yes, as always, you should definitely practice good security while you recover the account. That wasn't really part of the question. Everything you do with bitcoin should be done in the most secure way that you know how to. There are many ways to practice being secure and private. Go with what you know in this regard.

You can have as many accounts on a single trezor as you want, so at any time you can simply try recovering your account using your seed words. If it works you will see whatever funds are in the addresses within the recovered account. Once verified you can then simply delete the account and feel safe that you know how to recover it in the future.

Yes, except that brute forcing a 12 word mnemonic and actually randomly finding one that has ever been used before is even less likely than doing the same thing with a private key so you'd be better off brute forcing the p-key

Hi David, thanks for your personal response to this. I sincerely appreciate it. So you know, I have deleted this post from appearing on the subreddit. Like I said in the OP I have always been very very happy using egifter and have  introduced more than a few new people to your service and still will in the future .. I will just warn them about that one little option there.
I hope you consider my sincere suggestion that you make it more obvious to your customers that there is a choice they should consciously make between using Coinbase and not using coinbase. This is a very important distinction to a lot of bitcoin users, including me, for more than just matters of convenience too. Namely, I don't particularly trust Coinbase to respect my privacy.
Anyway, no harm no foul and lesson learned.
Thanks again... Amazon card ... .SPENT :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:51:59
I've been using eGifter for a while now and I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences using them. I have bought tons off of Amazon, from Target and other places using bitcoin and it's always been a flawless process.
Suddenly, it seems, they have silently switched their default bitcoin processing method to use Coinbase. I can't emphasise 'quietly' enough because it is almost insidious how greyed out and unnoticeworthy the option is to switch it back to using just a regular 'bitcoin address'.
Well I made the mistake of following my normal checkout process and then WHAM
nothing.. no card.. I can see the payment is made, I can see the address has already been emptied by somebody on the other side ... but no card...
Posted link is to my open support ticket with egifter ... they seem to not give one shit.
**Important to note** the first two communications are from wednesday ... today ... still no confirmation of my payment? WTF is bitcoin for???? Jesus, we can all see that payment was made. It's a public goddamn ledger! Give me my card or my money back!

the only way that dw will continue trying to send is if you have the 'enforce mixing' option enabled and there is nobody to mix with.. it will try to mix forever until it can.. but if you are just sending like a normal send it works like any other wallet. go check your address on blockchain.info .. i bet it already sent. dw is shitty at keeping synced to the block chain so sometimes a tx that has 3 confirms still shows 0 in dw. its alpha software btw so .. expect some quirks

Not an issue if you ask me.. bitcoin doesn't need anyone to pretend that it's some kind of law abiding citizen money. It's not and never has been. It will survive solely on its merits, not because it has a squeeky clean public persona. The badder it is, the better it is. If terrorists can trust bitcoin, thats a pretty damn good indication that bitcoin is the real deal.

Fiat money is evil. Unfortunately, that is the life blood of banks. So banks may not be evil, but they exist to serve evil. Once the fake money (the evil) is all gone.. banks won't be needed anymore. Are they evil? Maybe not, but their product is.

The funds need to go to a valid pubkey, not an address. The 'address' is a hash of the pubkey. (a pubkey made shorter so its easier to deal with) The hash can be technically valid as far as its format but unless it contains a valid pubkey when un-hashed the transaction cannot complete because it has nowhere to send the funds. Changing a single digit of a hashed value (a bitcoin address, for instance) completely changes the *contents* of the hash. So even if the hash is valid after mis-typing it, the un-hashed value will be something entirely different than the original pubkey.. in fact, it will likely be entirely different than any possible valid pubkey.

IMO the best way to get Bitcoin (not necessarily the fastest or easiest) is to sell items or services for it. Check out Open Bazaar. Also, any time I post things for sale on craigslist I offer fat discounts if paid in bitcoin. Hasn't worked yet.. but at some point I think it will.

Yes, you're right of course. I'm kinda simplifying to make the concept easy to grok. Essentially, if you were *able* to *un-hash* a bitcoin address (I think it's RIPEMD-160) you would get the pubkey.
@_date: 2016-10-11 13:58:22
It is virtually impossible to guess at a valid address or accidentally typo a valid address, therefore, since the address is most certainly invalid the tx will not be processed and the funds will not move.

There are so many factors contributing to the feedback loop with regard to bitcoin price, liquidity, mining, electricity costs, participants, ...on an on and on and on ... that it is actually quite pointless to try and make sense of the future based on one or two metrics like this.
Bitcoin was designed to be a self-correcting system. As one thing is happening, several other facors are balancing the effect. Every time people start to worry about some fatal flaw in the algorythm they realize they were not even considering all the myriad inputs going into the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin will be fine.

A private block chain is just an inefficient database. A private relational database is far superior in pretty much every way. Block chains are a solution for open public databases.

That's actually a pretty interesting idea for a whole new service ... one that connects bitcoin buyers with people who want to use bitcoin to pay bills. Buyers can set their own fee, can get bitcoin for below market value this way. You can use multi-sig escrow, the site holds the 3rd key for arbitration.. and with bills you can pretty much reliably verify whether a bill has been paid (by calling and checking the bill/account status) - could be a whole new market :)

Since they can do nothing to Bitcoin itself their only recourse will be to persecute their own citizens, they'll use it as an excuse to further ratchet up online surveillance to include watching for people and businesses that are communicating using the bitcoin protocol. It would be a lot like how they pretend to stop online piracy ... very ineffectively, and causing suffering to innocent people when it is at its most effectiveness. Like the war on drugs and other attempts to stifle the freedoms we enjoy, it will cause the exact opposite effect they are looking for but they'll never willingly stop because they will be filling their prisons with this fresh new source of "criminals" and making lots of money while they do.

About once a week (lately anyway) I order pizza from the Dominos web site. When I get to the checkout page I get my total and then open another browser tab and purchase a Dominos gift card for the exact amount I need. The gift card purchase happens immediately (so I assume they are honouring the purchase with 0 confirmations) and I can just switch tabs and use the card to complete my pizza order without any waiting.

In terms of winning, the odds are never in your favor. In fact, you will never even get *even odds* when playing against the house. Casinos never give you even odds. Odds of winning will *always* be in the casinos favor, even when they are playing fairly, the odds of you winning are less than theirs. This is how Casinos operate. So, having said that, over any stretch of playing the odds are that you will lose more than you win, so you can expect there to be more instances of losing streaks than of winning streaks, but either one can potentially last as long as the gods are playing with (or against) you.

Im not an expert on the technology but I can easily imagine a system that can transmit your network signal through electrical circuits in your house.. I already use wall socket LAN devices that do exactly this.. but now any light in the house can be a transceiver. So imagine you plug your network connection into a wall socket and every light in your house becomes a LiFi node. So the light in your bathroom will give you internet while you shower.. or in the kitchen .. on the back porch ..etc you just turn on a light
But I just thought of another good question... are these lights *transceivers*? How do they handle up-stream?

**Option 5** (AKA the 'US Foreign Policy' option): Drop bombs on the attackers. Drop more bombs on all of the users within 50 miles of the attackers. Drop a few more bombs on anybody who looks or acts like the attackers. Drop more bombs on their internet suppliers and hardware vendors for the attackers. Use blanket mass surveillance to watch everyone on the internet and if they attempt to circumvent your surveillance, *bomb them*. If you suspect someone is (or knows) an attacker, *bomb them*. Also bomb their friends, their families and their elementary schools and hospitals. When in doubt, or if you're just bored, *find more people to bomb*, twice if it's necessary.. or advantageous.. or politically useful.. or profitable.. or.. shit man, just bomb them. Oh yeah, and then take their oil.
Pro tip: Buy stock in bomb companies first

nope, a bitcoin address is actually a calculated hash of the full address (the pubkey). the odds of you accidentally mistyping a valid *hash* that, when un-hashed, returns a valid bitcoin pubkey is even less than trying to guess the *actual* pubkey, which in itself is nearly impossible. Nothing is impossible, of course .. but it's highly unlikely to ever happen. I mean like in the universe. Hehe

Bitcoin is money, so you can do anything in the world and accept bitcoin for doing it and you are adding to the network just as much as anybody else through your use of it. Sell things, offer services, accept bitcoin.. that makes your job a bitcoin job and you will be supporting and adding to the network. People dont really need 'bitcoin businesses' .. they just need places to spend and use their bitcoin. Be one of those. Build a web site and sell socks ... for bitcoin!

Im not sure if you mean to be saying something as ignorant as 'if you don't mine then your opinion of it doesnt matter' but I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that your retarded brother took over the keyboard for a minute and typed all that bullshit. I *earn* bitcoin. I am partially paid in bitcoin, I buy and sell bitcoin locally and I sell items and products for bitcoin. It's true I never put in the monumental effort of ... buying an expensive box and plugging it in (thats all your heroic miners do).. but I do understand the technology and the whole concept of mining better than perhaps most of the miners you've ever met. So basically go fuck yourself with your whole opinion of whether I deserve to voice my opinion. Mining matters more to me because I actually *use* bitcoin. Douche.

No, I'm saying that someone who needs bitcoin, really *needs it*, for more than just some fucking investment instrument to attach to their portfolio is going to have a much more relevant perspective on what bitcoin is and why it is important in term of it being a revolutionary technology. Jackass bitcoin "hodlers" get all jizz happy to hear about some fat cat "Top" investor talking about bitcoin because they hope that it means their own bitcoins will be worth more *dollars* if everybody listens to these idiot investors pump it up for themselves.

A block chain is *absolutely unnecessary* for establishing trust between known, private entities. A block chain would help if none of them knew who the others were, but that won't ever be the case for bank-to-bank transactions. Could they use a block chain? Sure they could, but it is in no way beneficial or necessary since all the members (miners? nodes?) on their chain will be necessarily identified and vetted on the network. It's all buzz words and confusion. "Block chains" are en vogue.. but just the word, not the concept.

Its true. Bitcoin is not about that stuff, but now you can go your own way. I think it's okay to look at BitPay as having gotten you familiar with what is involved when accepting bitcoin for your business. Now you can go out there and find ways to do it all yourself. They were the onramp but now you're ready to step on the gas and merge with traffic. The awesome thing about Bitcoin is that you're not forced to use banks to do *all things* related to money. Its a DIY financial network.

There is no difference between the words 'cult' and 'culture' and there is nothing inherently bad about either one. If you consider yourself part of the 'Bitcoin community' you are part of the cult.

Was introduced to the Silk Road when 1 BTC was $7 ... I purchased my first BTC through a now defunct exchange called Bitfloor which did not require any identity to sign up. User accounts were funded through anonymous cash deposit into their BofA account. So I bought some weed on the internet, which was a fantastic experience in itself, but my attention was drawn back to Bitfloor where the real action seemed to be. I started trading and was immediately rewarded over the next year or two as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed. I don't like to talk about what I'm holding but it's a decent amount of Bitcoin that will hopefully be my comfort and safety net for years to come.. probably the rest of my life, so long as Bitcoin survives and remains healthy. I can honestly say that Bitcoin has given me a lot. I don't trade anymore but I have financial security that I never would have had otherwise, and in more ways than one. Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever you are.

Firstly, muther fucker, I don't think I make a good case for your question because I feel like, for whatever reason, the people I know just don't give a shit about bitcoin. Trust me, if there were even a chance of on-boarding any of them they'd be on board by now. They've all heard me preach and they also all know that I made a lot of money with Bitcoin. I've given several friends paper wallets for various birthdays and such and to this day not a single goddamn satoshi has moved from any of those addresses and I would not be surprised if the paper wallets are lost by now. It still just simply has no place in their consciousness at this time. So the chances? I would estimate somewhere around zero. Maybe less. Like I said though, I dont think ... I mean I don't hope.. that my social circle is anything like the average out there. If it is we're all fucked.

Yes, its still in alpha though so its still very much use at your own risk for real bitcoins but I have been using it pretty heavily over the last couple weeks and I've gained a lot of confidence in it. Its quirky, no doubt, but it works well. The only drawback at the moment is that there are so few people using it yet so mixing can be hit or miss depending on the users online at any given time. I like it a lot tho.

Ok well sorry about for the thickness of attitude then. The bitcoin world is becoming full up of useless frikkin pragmatists who shit all over the whole premise of bitcoin with their apologetic attitudes toward centralization, it being something that just sorta happens and we gotta be realistic.blahhblahhllblallashit... fuck all that. These people just want their bitcoins to be worth a lot of money soon so they are willing to ..use centralized custodial web wallets .. ask for regulations and permission to use their bitcoins .. go the easy centralized mining route .. mo money mo money.. and now I'm quite sure that these bitcoin pretenders will gladly cut their losses and sell their miners to.. who cares who?.. just give me some more money than I have ... fuck bitcoin
You can disagree with this perspective all you like, that's your perogative, but I see this shit all day every day so I know what the weather is like in Bitcoin land. Miners are not in bitcoin for the tech.. from the very bottom kid with an ASIC instead of a heater in his flat up to the biggest mining firms ... its about the *dollars*. Dollars are attracted to centralization.. and centralization attracts dollars ... thats all there is to it... that's why they will always move toward breaking bitcoin so that it mines *dollars* for them .. not bitcoins. If you ask me, these are the people whose opinions dont mean shit. They barely know what bitcoin is.

1. The tx *happens* in the wallet software.. the Trezor signs the tx. If you disconnect while it is signing a tx that tx will probably be invalid but you cannot damage the Trezor by doing this .. or the blockchain .. so there are no worries.
2. Not sure but I highly doubt it. It never writes to any sort of media so it should be safe to remove at any time.
3. There is an Android app that allows you to receive payments and watch your addresses without needing to use the Trezor device.

inlfating bitcoin destroys it as far as Im concerned and I would stop using it, just like I will stop using dollars, and use whatever the crypto-anarchists and cipherpunks come up with that restores power to the people again. thats all this is about. power. im not giving it back. millions more wont either. they can inflate bitcoin and ruin it like a fiat if they want. we'll go somewhere else. in case you haven't noticed, what they do matters less and less every day.

terrorists like bitcoin for all the same reasons I do. the things they do have nothing to do with the money they're using. of course the media will work to confuse the two. but all of the things that make it perfect for terrorists are the same things that make it perfect for everyone in the whole world. you don't fight terrorism by mass surveillance and controlling the money of free people. that *is* terrorism.. on a governmental level. its sad to watch but bitcoin will survive their desperate attempts to demonize it. and if it doesn't something else will. the cat's out of the bag

ALL points of centralization are dangerous to bitcoin because these will always be targets for any and all persons and/or organizations who lust for any level of control over the network, be that a government or a corporation or whatever. In my opinion there is no acceptable level of centralization when it comes to bitcoin. The relaxed attitudes being cultivated in people currently is disturbing and sad. Nobody takes anything seriously anymore, even in the face of widespread corruption covering every square inch of this planet. Bitcoin should always seek to obsolesce that whole paradigm and Bitcoin's power comes directly out of its decentralized nature. The breakthrough invention *is* the decentralization part. All the other facets of Bitcoin existed in the past. Decentralization is its one true *strength* and novelty. Protect it. Not just .. eh .. a little.

But Visa is centralized so you dont need immediate settlement when you make purchases. The risk is assumed and placed mostly on the seller.. via charge backs. Different than how Bitcoin works, but if you're complaining about *speed* over anything else.. just use the faster system. Use Bitcoin when you want strong privacy and security and immutablitly and censorship resistance, store of value.. etc, etc, etc. Use Visa for your latte.

Absolutely! But rather than actually mining for bitcoins many startups have discovered that it is much more lucrative to mine bitcoiners for their dollars. It's pretty easy, just announce that you've invented a 5-bazillion ultra-mega-hash ASIC miner called something really cool like 'The Hash Pipe 9000' and offer them up for "limited private double-special early bird investor pre-sale". Then you can just start raking in the loot!

No, I started trading there after they were hacked. I remember they were slowly paying back those people who had lost money from that. However, I was there at the *end* of Bitfloor, which was another ordeal altogether, and while I didn't technically *lose* any money, I was definitely screwed over by them pretty good, me and many other traders, in the way that they did it.
Right before the exchange shut down nobody who was actively trading had any clue that it was about to happen, none whatsoever... except for friends of the exchange who were obviously tipped off ahead of everyone that they were about to shut the exchange floor down. Suddenly, within just a few minutes the price of BTC on the exchange went up by almost $10 dollars (!) as insiders began getting rid of all their fiat, buying BTC at whatever price they possibly could and withdrawing their bitcoins to a safe place. The rest of us had no idea what was going on and looked at this spike as an opportunity to make some quick money. I immediately dropped 30BTC and made a nice big fat profit instantly... or so I thought. Moments later the exchange shut down completely and, to make a long story short, all the fiat held by anyone at the exchange was stuck for **months** while we all waited for refunds. I personally had several thousand dollars stuck in their exchange, others had much much more than me.. but we all waited through the same months of hell wondering how we were going to get our money back and organizing just in case we would all have to somehow sue for our money back. Eventually we got it all back, but in the meantime the price of Bitcoin increased well beyond what it was that day so all of that stuck fiat capital just sat there basically losing all it's useful buying value against Bitcoin.. so that kinda sucked, even though we did get our money back. It was a shitty ordeal but, in the end, nothing nearly as horrible as what happened to MtGox users.

Crypto-currencies like bitcoin (open/decentralized) are regulated **only** by their algorithms, not by governments. Governments regulate the people and businesses within their own borders, they do not regulate open internet protocols used by the entire planet. They can regulate/fine/punish/imprison *you or your business* but they can't do anything at all to effect the currency itself. The block chain and its network are outside of their control. You and your business, on the other hand, are not.

Sharing your trezor seed with **any** other wallet exposes your keys and renders the Trezor compeletly useless since the whole point of a Trezor is to **never** expose your keys to any other device.
A Trezor is not just a cool looking device to spend bitcoin with. Its meant to be used **offline** as cold storage and transaction signing. There are other more appropriate devices to use for spending and transacting bitcoin.

You don't have to be the spender. Whatever you did do with those bitcoins, good, bad or whatever doesn't matter, it will be linked to your identity. Regardless of whether or not it can be proven whether you own the subsequent addresses or not is only relevant to some arbitrary specific hypothetical scenario. make no mistake.. your identity will forever be tied to these transactions to be used and interpreted in whatever way they will be in the future. you will have no say in how these relationships are interpreted and/or used by anyone and for any reason. its all public.

With Bitcoin, the money either moves or it stays where it is .. so you don't need to worry about bitcoins *disappearing* .. it may take time for the block chain to settle the TX but the funds will end up either at the *send* or the *receive* address depending only on whether the TX was valid or not. Nothing else is possible. Try and be patient.

all useless data if it cannot be attached to an identity
for one, I dont vote ... so there's that
voting is for idiots, especially here on reddit
and my IP address comes from a VPN so it cannot be used to identify me
I don't stay logged in to reddit so their cookies dont follow me around the internet like they may do for you
like I said .. they don't know anything about me, nor should they
if they can identify you it's because you don't take care to make it impossible. I do
the bottom line is that, regardless of their TOS, your privacy is *yours to protect*, not theirs

...and yet, not you or anyone else can find a single transaction on that block chain and relate it to me and I have no worries that you will ever be able to either, regardless of how much I use bitcoin.. because privacy is something that I provide, not bitcoin. Bitcoin is simply a protocol.. a protocol which happens to be compatible with privacy and anonymity.. but is not a *provider* of these things. You bring the privacy/anonymity and bitcoin will protect it.

I've been using bitcoin for a relatively long time and for me it has the really nice feature of being all sorts of things. I own bitcoins that would be only moderately difficult to identify as mine if placed under heavy scrutiny. I consider transactions with these bitcoins to be high-privacy but only *decent* transactional anonymity. I tend to think of these bitcoins as having *replaced my bank cards and and transactions* with more secure and more private p2p transactions. But I also have bitcoins that have replaced *cash* in my financial life. That's an enormously important thing that bitcoin *needs* to be able to do in order to be successful. It has to replace person-to-person anonymous cash transactions too. If bitcoin cannot do that.. if it cannot be used anonymously in a p2p fashion, it won't last and something else that can will. I certainly would stop using it if I could not do my cash transactions with it anonymously and I would adopt a cryptocurrency that does. Many of my bitcoins are in this 'cash' category and they cannot be attributed to me. How I use them will determine whether I maintain my own anonymity.

It can be used as a payment system, sure. You can use email as a voting system or to transfer files .. or even as a basic payment system itself! .. but you wouldn't label it as either of those things. Well, you can.. and you'd be technically correct, but you're still spinning it. Bitcoin is a network protocol that can be used for perhaps thousands or millions of different purposes, payments being one. Your car mostly gets you to work every day.. but would you call it your 'work trasport system'? Maybe you would. I wouldnt

@_date: 2015-02-23 17:02:10
yes, exactly. do have fun with your business idea that has loosely to do with bitcoin.
the only thing from the current  financial system that bitcoin should look or act anything like is CASH. things like chargebacks are the result of a broken system and you want to keep the tradition alive because people are used to it and maybe they'll even pay for it since bitcoin got rid of it. I totally get it.
meanwhile the rest of us will move into the new paradigm.

@_date: 2015-02-25 14:45:17
I'll tell you what I use but there are a lot of really good wallets and other things out there beyond what I personally use.
I use [Mycelium]( as my mobile hot wallet. I use it to buy and sell P2P and I use it to have spending bitcoins with me when I'm out.
I also always keep some spending money in a [DarkWallet]( for online purchases that I make in-browser and for mixing all my wallets periodically for privacy and anonymity purposes. Dark wallet is awesome. Stealth addresses are awesome. Coinjoin is awesome.
**cold storage**
I use a [Trezor]( for what I call medium-term cold storage. Trezors are highly secure and also relatively simple to pull funds from. I will move funds out of medium cold storage into my spending money every so often and it's pretty easy, though not convenient enough to use for regular purchases. Having a store like this isn't the best for volatility reasons but I like to know I have surpluss bitcoins in case I can't find any to buy locally at any given time.
**deep freeze**
I have a multisignature brain wallet where I keep a few bitcoins that I don't plan to touch for a long time ... at least 2020 ..

There must always be an anonymous form of currency. If Bitcoin is to replace cash for this purpose, which I hope it does, then it will need to support anonymity. If it doesn't, I won't use it.. something else will, and I'll use that.

I don't see why not, you should bring it up on the DW dev forum. It may already be one of the considerations for the future.
How about, when you decide you want to leave your funds open for mixing.. maybe you can set your own  tiny fee for anyone who mixes with you..?
I don't like the idea of paying more for mixing ... but if it makes sense then people will do it.. and its a free market so I say let it evolve however the market participants want.

Unfortunately, the greater 'bitcoin community' doesn't have any roots in, or much knowlege of, the founding principals of Bitcoin. Why it was created in the first place. It's like everybody telling you to *get on AOL!* back in the beginning of the internet ... they mean well but they themselves don't really know what they're doing.

Here's how you can predict the value of bitcoin accurately for any future date.
1) Pick a date
2) Add all the digits of the date together
3) Now add those digits up.. and then add those digits .. etc.. until you have a 2-digit number
4) Fill a small plastic bowl with water that is the same temperature as the 2-digit number from step 3
5) Dip your balls into the water
6) Count the rinkles, the number you get will be the price of bitcoin for that date.
I swear it works .. OMG Ima be RICH!

Thats exactly what a "gold backed" currency is. 1 dollar = x amount of gold.. that relationship never changes. The US dollar used to actually state that "this note entitles the barer to X gold from the US treasury" ..etc...
Im paraphrasing but thats basically what it used to say before they went off the gold standard in 72
In fact, "dollars" used to be called "gold certificates" .. and "silver certificates"

Alice, Bob and Carl each create their own bitcoin address that they control. Just a regular old bitcoin address.
Alice, Bob and Carl all take their public keys and combine them into a single address and define some rules to determine how many of the keys are needed to spend funds from the address. (they make it a 2 of 3 address)
Bob creates a transaction to move funds from the multisig address to some other address and signs the transaction. If he broadcasts this transaction to the bitcoin network it will fail. It needs two signatures.
Bob gives the transaction to one of the other two participants. If either one of them signs it they can then broadcast it and this time it will be valid and the funds will be moved.
That's about as simple as I can imagine explaining it.

They call them ATMs because ignorant people know what an ATM is and so they are not required to understand anything about it beyond whatever similarities to an ATM they can pretend to be experiencing.

This is good news. If it's successful then we'll know Bitcoin is the wrong tech and can try something else. Bitcoin must be tested to every extreme. I say bring it on.

hard to say what the future holds. could be. i still think the bitcoin blockchain will continue to evolve as people invent new methods of maintaining anonymity and privacy in the same way that the internet as a whole continues to evolve new ways to do the same. it's still too early in bitcoin's life to guess what it will look like even in 5 years time. all I know for sure is that the reason bitcoin exists at all is because people will always be motivated to subvert oppressive systems of control ...  surveillance .. etc. If not bitcoin.. or monero.. something else..

Yes, Mycelium and DarkWallet are both thin clients that do not download the entire block chain. Your keys are not exposed but you do trust their connection to the block chain is true. I don't consider it a danger for myself but I suppose there is always the option of hosting and using your own node instead of theirs. With Trezor, currently the most widely used wallet is their own propietary web wallet so there is no need to download the block chain if you use that. There are a few new Trezor-comatible wallets coming out as we speak actually. With a Trezor your private key never ever leaves the hardware FOB so it is completely secure. (Just don't lose your seed words!)
A brain wallet is something you can create yourself. It's called brain wallet because you remember a passphrase and that's it. You enter the passphrase into a brainwallet tool and it generates all the keys to your address. I use an offline copy of  to create 3 addresses based on 3 passphrase that only I know. Then you can use  to create a multisig address using those three brain wallet addresses.
Oh another cool thing I like about the Trezor is their android app. It's not a full wallet app, it only receives payments.. but it will generate new clean HD addresses on the fly that will let you accept payments *into* your trezor anytime anywhere.. which is a pretty cool idea if you have business or maybe a charity collecting money that goes basically into a one-way only super safe deposit address.
Eventually the Trezor will have some nice full-featured wallet applications and then it may be a perfect do-it-all wallet.

I think you have some confusion about what actually constitutes the real world and what you personally consider to be the real world. Anonymity is alive and well on the internet and on the block chain for anybody who wants it. It's free for anyone who wants to use it.. me, you, terrorists, the pope, pedophiles (redundant i know), and anyone else for whatever purposes they like, good or evil. Bitcoin will either be useable in this capacity or it won't (and even then, it can be a nice and powerful govcoin). But if it doesn't I won't use it and neither will many other more principled people.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:50:39
Im also correct in the sense that a block chain runs on incentive. That's how a block chain works. That's what it *is*. It's a network of nodes all competing by the rules of the network in order to process  transactions, secure the network and ... get paid for their effort. A block chain, Bitcoin or otherwise, will only exist so long as its token of value does.

All of my normal friends know about bitcoin and not a single one of them cares about it even a little. They are much too busy with their conventional lives to invest much thought in something that isn't related to watching tv, drinking beer, investing in realestate, video games or sex. Not necesarily in that order, but it's pretty close. What may be more shocking, and certainly most disappointing for me at least, is that I am a software developer and I work with about 15 other developers where I work and I shit you not.. not a single worthless one of them knows anything about Bitcoin beyond what they might have overheard on tv when, god forbid, their internet is down and they can't be playing video games online. To be honest, the only person whom I know personally and talk to regularly who also knows about and is interested in Bitcoin is my mom. And I've already taught her how to do pretty much everything she needs to do all by herself. I really do think its a good idea though because other more normal people probably do have intelligent friends who could use it.

(1) It must be durable, which is why we don’t use wheat or corn or rice.
(2) It must be divisible, which is why we don’t use art work.
(3) It must be convenient, which is why we don’t use lead or copper.
(4) It must be consistent, which is why we don’t use real estate.
(5) It must possess value in itself, which is why we don’t use paper.
(6) It must be limited in the quantity that is available, which is why we don’t use aluminum or iron.
(7) It should have a long history of acceptance, which is why we don’t use molybdenum or rhodium.

Bitcoin has a function called.. **CheckLockTimeVerify**.. i think thats what its called. Go read up on how to create an address that uses this function to create an address that you cannot spend from until after a certain date *or* after a certain block height.
Put your money in there and go about your life.. since you cant spend em anyways.. might make forgetting about them a little easier.

Unfortunately, bitcoin is still in beta and won't be easy to use for a while to come. And so impatience has convinced many people to forget why bitcoin was needed in the first place and they've started simply integrating it into their existing broken, identity-laden banking habits.
If you exercise patience and take the time and initiative to transact P2P as bitcoin was meant to be used you start to understand why its important that it stays that way.

You should never imagine that you have any amount of security when you give the keys to your money to a third party. Ever. Whoever holds the keys owns and controls the bitcoins. They are not yours if you don't hold they keys. Remember that. It will never not be the case. You can have security,. or you can trust someone else. Bitcoin removed the need for trust, that's its genius.. and you would like to add it back in. Think about that.

well that really is a subjective question. every person has their own level of privacy that they desire, and even then it will vary from one tx to another. if I desire *strong* anonymity for a particular transaction I will use Tor to send my tx directly through Shapeshift. there are other tx's that i make completely in the clear, so to speak, like purchasing an Amazon gift card. I just use my hot wallet on my phone. Everyone should know how to transact at all the different levels of privacy and anonymity. Its just good practice and you will start to instinctively know how private a given tx should be and how to accomplish that.

Bitcoin balances were never affected and were easily withdrawn but dollars were a mess to sort out so it was nerve wracking for a couple months but ended relatively well for everybody considering what had happened at other exchanges. In the end we all got all our money returned to us.

No, I think Coinbase should do whatever they want, but I don't think people should use Coinbase and this is just one tiny little reason why. A good, legitimate reason: You don't control your money, you ask them for permission to use it and then you use it only in the way they want you to. If that doesn't turn your stomach as I believe it should, by all means.. use Coinbase.

The current standard being set by OpenBazaar of using arbiters and multisig seems the best route at the moment and there are other new cryptographic tricks being worked on now that should hopefully make it even simpler.

I have nothing against small local banks or credit unions and, like I said before, I will still *have* a bank account to use for whatever purposes I may still have for it .. I just mean that I barely need one now and plan to need one even less in the future. I'm not suggesting that this is the path forward for everyone, but it is for me and it's a really good feeling since I've been working toward it for a long time. Bitcoin makes it possible to imagine a future without a bank but still being able to conduct my finances with privacy and security and on my own terms.

Im not necessarily  talking about the Ethereum blockchain because, apart from the liability or any specific contract being targeted, I think each instance of fraud and/or negligence will effect the whole network in all sorts of negative ways including, but not limited to, driving the price of the underlying asset down. And since regulators know the creator of Ethereum, he will get dragged into every issue whether it's fair or not. It's why Satoshi disappeared. I'm sure Etheureum will survive but it sure won't be a smoothe ride and I think Vitamin Butter will have grey hair in his 30s.
If I had to guess, I'd say at some point they will begin to restrict the types of things people can create on the network by removing some of its programability .. to 'protect users' .. and that would be a big hit to the value proposition of Ethereum.

directly in bitcoin if they are willing and/or want a greatly discounted price, which goes a long way toward introducing new people to bitcoin, but obviously I can accept any form of payment.. I don't mind exchanging dollars into bitcoin myself, its pretty easy once you start doing it regularly.. it can take a lot more time to exchange locally but I am generally never pressed for time as far as exchanging is concerned.

Ok, fair enough, good to see your thoughts laid out and I think we both pretty much agree at least on the point that localbitcoins *is* a perfectly good solution for the particular thing that it does, which is a very different thing than an exchange like GDAX does.
The first few lines of your last reply felt more like just another angry assumption. A person who goes to their site for the first time, sees some of the fees and immediately closes the tab would have basically the same thing to say and not even know what they're talking about. So that's how it seemed to me since there is a lot more to be said about each negative claim you made, if someone has used the site. So maybe you were just being kurt, and that's cool now that you've elaborated a bit.

it wont ask for an OLD password .. just a password to apply to the list of words you gave it.. it doesn't necessarily know if you are reconstructing a wallet or creating a new one.. it uses the words+password to create a key and then looks for that key on the blockchain and gives you the balance/tx history if there is any ... like I said before.. if you know the 12 words AND definitely know the password, enter those when it asks and you should see your old wallet history. If you see nothing then you probably got either a word wrong .. or the password.

Not true, in the United States we have a voluntary tax system. Its true, look it up. When you volunteer your financial information, which is what you do when you claim your income for the IRS, your privacy is not being violated because you are the one reporting the information you decide to report.. if your *privacy* were being violated they would already know everything they need to.
I think you are confusing privacy with responsibility or something. It is your *responsibility* to report your income. They dont come and look for themselves and there is a big difference in terms of liberty. You are free'er than you think I think.

Yep. There are generally considered to be three levels of wallet useage... but these levels are mostly arbitrary delineations.
Cold Storage: Paper wallets and other offline permanent storage methods. For bitcoins you intend to store indefinitely. This is the most secure option but very difficult to spend them. And so very difficult (or impossible) to steal them.
Medium (warm) Storage: This is where the Trezor and other hardware wallets live. This is medium-term storage, very good security, keys are stored offline but are accessible through the wallet software so, not *that* hard to spend your bitcoins if you need to but otherwise they are offline.
Hot Wallet: This would be the wallet you spend from regularly such as a mobile wallet like Samourai or Mycelium, etc or a wallet on your PC. This is the least secure option but very easy to spend from.. for buying things .. giving money to your friends, etc.

You've obviously never used it so let me shed some light for ya.
1) The fees on localbitcoins are set by the buyer or seller. That means you can set your terms yourself by posting a trade rather than browsing for one.
2) You can buy and sell bitcoins with anyone in the entire country you live in, you certainly do not ever have to meet someone in person. In fact the vast majority of traders do not do the in-person thing.
but you already know all about how the site works since you've used it, right? I mean why else would you want to speak as though you know? so im sure you did.. maybe you just forgot.
localbitcoins is not for everyone. it's for people with particular needs and it fills those needs perfectly.

I'm curious, when a user converts on your site.. through the api.. does Shapeshift identify the IP address of your server or is the user's IP passed along to their API? I use Tor with Shapeshift for anonymity reasons and am basically wondering if using an API-driven site like yours would be just as private since, I assume, you probably are not storing user IPs in your db..or maybe you do?

For me its definitely already happening. By next year I will probably still technically *have* a bank account but I already barely use it, less and less each month. I don't *buy* bitcoin from exchanges, I trade locally and I *earn* bitcoin whenever I can. I have never in my life used, and never intend to use, credit and I would never finance anything to begin with, including a house. I have absolutely zero debt and a very cumfy savings that grows continuously. So yeah, I'm not *average* by any stretch.. but average isn't a good idea if you ask me.

no, not competition from the current system. I don't believe the current system can compete with bitcoin in all the ways that matter. people are entrenched within and conditioned to use the current system. where http was 'adopted' ..it was the only choice.. it would be more accurate to say that bitcoin will be 'migrated to' .. which is a slower process than straight up adoption because people will generally only migrate to a new system when they discover a reason to and the truth is most people are happy as clams to continue participating in the existing mainstream financial system, oblivious to the injustices.

Just keep 'em safe. Maybe a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:17:42
But if you change your perspective just a little bit you might see that that's exactly what Im talking about. Think of 'the internet' for example, of which Bitcoin is simply a protocol just like HTTP and SMTP and FTP etc. Well.. Litecoin is also its own protocol. When you view a web page you are using protocols like UDP, TCP, TCP-IP, HTTP .. it took a while for all of these protocols to be seemlessly integrated so that you dont think of them as separate, you use the top layer HTTP. Likewise, when you make a financial transaction in the future.. it may not even be called a "bitcoin" transaction.. but that protocol will be there at the bottom of the stack (like TCP is for everything you do online), with more protocols layered on top and in parallel to a degree by which you dont even have to know which protocols (blockchains) are involved.
This is very early days for cryptos.

I bank with a small Maryland bank called M&amp;T. They're really a great bank actually and I've been their customer for almost 20 years and this funny meme isn't necessarily addressed to them.. its more about the general memosity of bitcoins replacing the need for banks.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:13:56
You can do that, sure. Offline paper wallet storage of keys is a very common cold storage practice and it's one of the safest ways to store your coins (keys).. assuming you can keep a piece of paper safe (or *in* a safe). Any decent wallet will have a method of importing a private key, it's one of the essential functions of a good bitcoin wallet.

one of the very best uses for bitcoin is completely free for you to use. bitcoin is a reliable place to store your wealth where it is not subject to inflation or surveillance by governments and corporations or bankers who try continually to erode its value right out from under you. that alone is worth quite a lot because every day there are fewer and fewer choices for you if you desire these properties in your financial dealings. privacy. security. censorship resistance. sovereignty. not as hip as buying a latte with your iphone i know, but super valuable. bitcoin will continue

bitcoin is a truly free market and will ultimately adjust itself to operate in a manner that is most stable for itself. if the transaction prices become prohibitive then i imagine people will stop using it.. theoretically forcing miners to harvest lower fee txs .. bitcoin is loaded with many feedback mechanisms intended to allow it to seek a natural balance. the fees right now are exactly as high as many people are willing to pay.. when that is no longer the case, txs will drop along with fees and the miners will take them. its like a living organism and it will not kill itself for greed like many imagine ... though it may threaten to at times
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:03:33
From what I understand so far, and obviously I haven't used lightning network yet so anyone is free to correct me on this, each wallet maker will have to implement lightning network functionality.. so assuming both our wallets already support it, we could create/open a channel between us and begin sending transaction back and forth and when we're done we close the channel and then a single tx resulting from all our tx's is settled on the block chain.

There are generally considered to be three levels of wallet usage... but these levels are mostly arbitrary delineations.
Cold Storage: Paper wallets and other offline permanent storage methods. For bitcoins you intend to store indefinitely. This is the most secure option but very difficult to spend them. And so very difficult (or impossible) to steal them.
Medium (warm) Storage: This is where the Trezor and other hardware wallets live. This is medium-term storage, very good security, keys are stored offline but are accessible through the wallet software so, not *that* hard to spend your bitcoins if you need to but otherwise they are offline.
Hot Wallet: This would be the wallet you spend from regularly such as a mobile wallet like Samourai or Mycelium, etc or a wallet on your PC. This is the least secure option but very easy to spend from.. for buying things .. giving money to your friends, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:06:23
Bitcoin should be like cash. Completely anonymous. Nobody can look at the $5 bill you paid with and see your other purchases or have any info at all about your *other* money. That's how bitcoin should be.. and can be. In the future I believe it will be anonymous by default. Right now you have to work for it.

Check the liquidity of the coins you are converting from/into before you execute your trade. If there is no liquidity you will probably want to wait until there is. They have no control over the volume of the coins being traded. If nobody is providing volume for a particular coin you won't be able to get any of that coin until somebody is.. which makes sense. I could have sworn there used to be a time limit after which your funds are returned to your refund address, but that may have changed if you say people are waiting for days. But that's how it works.

Nonsense. They are operating in a free market. You can do as they do. Anyone can. That's something that absolutely cannot be said about any regulated market anywhere in the world. You are essentially saying you find free markets 'rotten'. You've been conditioned to think that way by central planners. Free markets are not socialist, they are capitalist. Free markets are not fair to everyone, they reward disproportionately. You want a fair and balanced market? Maybe try socialism. I think you are bringing bad ideas to a free market so *of course* it's not going to make sense to you.

I use [Samourai Wallet for Andoid]( and it uses what it calls "smart miner fees". You can set the fee to Low, Normal and Priority. Here is how it describes these on their site:
Samourai offers three different miner fee profiles: 
Use Normal for an estimated confirmation time of 30 minutes
Use Priority for confirmation in the next 0-1 blocks
Use Low for an estimated confirmation time of 60 minutes.
I personally always use Priority and to give you an idea of what that costs, I just sent a $104 tx this morning.. my fee came to about $2.80 and priority fee means my tx **always** gets included in the very next block.
Samourai is the best mobile wallet IMO .. it has some unique privacy and security features. I love it.

Oh no its totally not possible yet, I hope I didn't come off like I am living on bitcoin.. because thats not the case at all.. I simply dont use my *bank account* very often and plan to use it less and less moving forward. I currently still pay for rent and utils using my bank account. For almost everything else I use cash, or bitcoin if I can.. and its becoming so much easier these days. I use bitcoin on Amazon for so many things. I shop for groceries and supplies at Target using gift cards I purchase with bitcoin.. actually there are a ton of stores and restaurants I can use my bitcoin at using gift cards. There's even five local restaurants here that I order from who accept bitcoin directly.. (btw any restaurant that uses menufy.com can accept bitcoin.. not all do, but most) Sorry, I digress.
Oh the coolest thing is that nowadays (this year) everybody in my large family and most of my friends all want bitcoin! So we are starting to pay each other owed money using bitcoin.. well.. mostly me giving them bitcoin haha

speculators will continue to drive the price up as high as possible ahead of time and then all at once they will all try to dump everything they have the week before Aug 1 to protect their profits which will crash the price probably below 1000 again and maybe even much lower than that. regardless of the outcome the price of the dominant chain (assuming there may be two) wont recover back to this level for 6mo to a year after that happens .. at the earliest IMO
strap in. we're headed for some chop.. but im not worried for the long term. bitcoin is too useful and important and valuable to stop existing entirely. eventually it will find stable equilibrium of some type or another .. might not look like it does now .. but it will be what it will be

No, you dont understand. There are 12 words in the mnemonic .. *and* there is a password (which you can think of AS a 13th word.. but it is NOT a 13th word) do not enter it into the mnemonic list. You can use the same 12 words + any new password and create a new wallet ... in order to recreate your OLD wallet you will NEED the actual password you used. If you get the password right you will see your TX history .. if you get the password worng you will see a fresh new wallet with no balance and no history and that new wallet will use the new password. You might want to learn about the BIP ... I think its BIP39

Personally I don't believe cryptocurrencies are a zero-sum game. I think there will be probably five or six very strong currencies that each perform their niche perfectly and they will be instantaneously convertible into each other right inside your wallet. I think Bitcoin will be the 'store of value' chain. Like gold. When you want to buy a coffee maybe your wallet converts $3.50 into LTC.. or something like that. When you buy drugs online, maybe you'll pay with Monero for strong anonymity.. but again, from the same wallet.

You seem pretty fixated on the tax-avoidance properties of Bitcoin and I have no doubt that whatever you are cooking up, Bitcoin will probably be a powerful tool for accomplishing your goals, no doubt about it, because it is very powerful in terms of personal sovereignty and empowers you the way that only real, sound money can.. but I can't give you advice on how that works because I pay my taxes and I don't convert btc to usd. ever! that sort of thing is for the newbs hehe

Pretty much same here. Traded at Bitfloor.com (now defunct) from 2011 to 2013 ... $7 bitcoins seemed outrageously expensive to me at first. Never bothered with Gox since they required ID to sign up, bitfloor did not, so I dodged that bullet too. I gave up the trading thing because once you're holding a bunch it makes more sense to just hold on than to deal with the stress of timing this crazy market. Nowadays I just sit back and watch the show and smile. I quit my job a few months ago and do not plan to ever work for anyone but myself from here on out. Thank you Satoshi!

Because a contentious fork of *any kind* is a dangerous event for Bitcoin and speculative investors are not into taking unnecessary risks with their profits. Nervous investors will dump ahead of the fork. HODLers won't. I think the former outnumber the latter by a lot.

Dont pay taxes? What exactly does financial privacy have to do with dodging taxes? You are drawing conclusions of your own, bud. You need to pay your taxes regardless of how private your finances are. You report your income and pay taxes on them. That's how it works.. its not they watch you and know how much money you have and tell you what to pay. Not in this country anyway. Well, not yet. Your right to financial privacy has nothing to do with your responsibility to pay taxes on income. The way I see it the two subjects are mutually exclusive. I'm not sure why one necessarily means the other to you but I pay taxes every year and have since I was 15 or 16.

your bitcoins arent in your wallet, they are on the blockchain, the wallet holds your *keys*.. so if you backup and save your wallet (your keys) you dont even necessarily need any wallet software at all to access your bitcoins because you could broadcast transactions manually if you really wanted to. but keys are keys. they work on the blockchain, not just in a particular wallet.. so back them up!

Obviously they *want* the regulations to be capable of *stopping* bitcoin from destroying their business model.. under the false pretense of AML KYC. Unfortunately for them it is now a foregone conclusion. Just like the demise of print media.. and video rental stores .. and a hundred other now largely extinct industries replaced by the steady march forward of the internet and technology in general.. as a protocol of that internet, Bitcoin is *exactly* this type of technology and WU may as well be Blockbuster Video.

Check the TX on a block explorer to confirm it exists.. if it does, contact the vendor to sort it out. Don't bother contacting Coinbase, they can't help and they won't respond anyway. If there is no TX on the blockchain just restart the process, this time it *might* work.

the two addresses are not linked so knowing one address will not tip your recipient off to the existence of the other address. If you, on the other hand, are using an HD wallet (and you most probably are) then you have an xpub key that can derive all of your addresses from itself.. so YOU can know all your linked addresses.. but as long as you never share your xpub with anyone (and you never should) they will never know about any other addresses that may be related to one you gave them.

Much too generous

Well I think a lot of what happens will depend entirely on the outcome of the UASF .. if there is a split.. nobody can honestly or accurately predict how people will respond to having two competing bitcoins. Not to mention that Aug 1st, rather than being the end,  might only be the first of a long series of battles and attacks that drag on for longer than I'd like to imagine and drag the price down in the meantime.

cannot. simple as that

Yeah, the markup is pretty ruthless most of the time. I've never minded it too much because all my bitcoins pretty much go straight into deep hodl mode and so the premium I pay is typically erased in short order by the price of bitcoin going up. Alternatively, you can use the 'post a trade' link to create your own listing and set your own markup/markdown. You'll have to wait for someone to trade with you but you can set your own terms that way.
