Wow you really are a dumb fuck - no, a simple call to their bank doesn't solve all my issues. First of all I can't call a bank and just ask about company so and so's balance. The company can request a letter from their bank, but that's about it.
The problem is bank balances of a business at any one time can fluctuate massively. Taxes paid or unpaid for a period, suppliers paid or unpaid for a period, etc. A letter from a bank (not just a call) can only tell you the cash position at any given time. In the UK for example my company is holding VAT for around 2-3 months on average, that's about £60-£90k just in VAT, but this is not the companies cash it belongs to HMRC. Companies Tax is held until year end. The accounts and the bank balance always show two very different cash positions. Yes the bank can hold funds as guarantee, but that's no guarantee the Greek gov won't dip into those funds ala Cyprus.
The first question is: Do you trust Greek banks?
Only by answering "Yes" can you trust any existing methods of proving funds. My answer is "no".
By this company sticking eu50k in an account customers can monitor, they are both making a statement about their financial position, and assuring their ability to operate for x period of time with those funds should shit hit the fan, or to refund x% of orders if things go wrong.
But if you knew the first fuck about business I wouldn't have to explain this to you.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:23:29
You're obviously thinking about hairdressers... Any business should always retain a few months operating expenses, in large scale manufacturing 6-12 months as a minimum.
A factory in Greece with international customers is, right now, struggling to retain clients. Moving some cash and potentially losing a portion of those funds is an excellent investment if it can give clients reassurance to continue ordering.
You are not a business person clearly.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:31:22
No, eu50,000 proof of cash.
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:08:11
With a 6 week lead time, so yes, around £60k of unfulfilled orders with them at any one time. You are clearly a dumb fuck, and a cock.

"dev cycle" - really? Its a tiny fucking change. Most of those clients probably haven't even got the maximum block size set
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:35:29
There is already anti-bitcoin lobbying... 
No you could not buy all the coins for $1bil - it would take only $1.5mil on just one exchange to bid the price up to $300/btc - by the time you've spent your 1$bil the price would be over $1mil/BTC but you won't have had any effect on the network. 
What about mining? Ok maybe $1bil would make a dent... 
The cheapest hardware/GH on the market is the Antminer S5 at $0.33/GH so it would cost $117mil to gain 50% TNHR. But $650,000/day in electricity costs alone... To roll that out would take months to years and in that time hashrates will have doubled, doubling the cost of a 50% attack and the costs to keep the attack up. It wouldn't work.
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:08:24
Many greeks still have access to online banking... the run on banks is primarily a cash concern at this stage.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:14:11
Well yes and no, both chains will be slowed and if the split is 50:50 then both chains will be slowed substantially.
If the split persists long enough then after consensus is reached we might see 3 minute blocks for a week. Or if one chain reaches difficulty adjustment first it should leap ahead in block height.
Both of these are pretty unlikely. It is EXTREMELY unlikely two chains with sufficient hashing power to mine more than a couple of blocks will persist.
Back in March 2013 there was an accidental hard-fork and within 7 hours not only was there a patch, but the new chain overtook the old chain.

@_date: 2015-06-24 07:30:34
Nobody said single order - this is for a series of orders (15-25 depending on the month, average £2k/order) 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:10:01
That's exactly what I asked them to do :-)
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:34:24
To be fair typical bitcoin concensus would be simply the longest chain.... 
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:12:18
If they dip into that 50k it will give me enough forewarning to not put good money after bad. It could potentially also allow them to trade through and out of a crisis. If the Greek gov rapes their bank accounts then it also gives them a protected bit of cash to lubricate the flow.
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:23:32
There's peak operating costs, which for this factory is around eu80k-100k/month and then there's base operating costs. In this case base operating costs I'm estimating at around eu20k/month.
Another factory I work with in the UK has £300k/month operating costs but could scale down to £15k/month and remain liquid.
The point is eu50k is enough that if the factory is struggling it will keep it operating long enough to fulfil my orders, and it's small enough to be easily fronted up by a company of this size with a healthy cash flow.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:32:07
What people forget is that miners will set their own maximum block sizes that they will create. In part this will be decided by the minimum fees they're prepared to process... self balancing equilibrium with sensible limits.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:34:58
The idea on my end is that I can monitor the address, and if funds start to be used/moved my little alarm bell will go off and I can open discussions before sending further orders.

@_date: 2015-06-04 07:05:29
This is a bad suggestion in a number of different ways.
1) miners opting to process only small blocks in order to reduce propagation time will bring the average down
2) It's easy to spam 144 blocks bringing the average block size waaaaay up

Not at all - it's just recalibrating units of currency as a result of growth. It has no impact on the currency or value.

If I understand correctly the block hash, ie. the number which needs to be lower than the difficulty, is based on not only the previous block but also the contents of the current block.
Ie. I have a block which includes 10 transactions, one of which is the block reward transaction. The hash I create is based on the contents of the block as well as the previous block.
Therefore if I'm mining on Eligius and I find a block, I can't simply not report that block and instead solo-mine the same block, because the contents of the block would be different and therefore the block hash would also be different, since the block reward address would be different...
And then you've got the insurmountably problem of having to re-discover a new block hash on your new block which is below the difficulty which completely defeats the purpose of not reporting the block in the first place...
If it were possible to mine a block within a pool but to withhold that block and instead "solo" mine the same block when you found it, pool mining wouldn't be possible, and everyone would be doing this.

This won't work because:
A block hash is calculated based on the transactions in the block.
Every hash is calculated independently with an equal chance of mining a block regardless of the hash input (block contents)
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:03:20
This won't work because:
Miners have to wait until there are xKb of transactions before being able to mine a block
If it's based on the volume of pending transactions then this will never happen. Also there is an argument to be made that if there aren't enough transactions we don't actually need a block.

It takes western union about 3.2WH to process one transaction (an LED spot light for an hour) - it currently takes 1080WH to process one bitcoin transaction (a small heater for an hour). In one year that will drop to around 500WH, in 2020 to 250WH, down to 1.95WH by 2048 and eventually ends up at around 0.00006WH/transaction.

An unfortunate paragraph... I would also suggest there are implied terms not to stop servicing american or canadian citizens until the end of the transitionary period, which clearly hasn't been completed - the reasons for which would need to be debated. But a breach of this clause would need to be predicated by completion of a transition, which hasn't happened.

If bitcoin was purely, simply and ONLY a transactional currency, I would agree... but it isn't.

It's a transactional infrastructure

Sell a quarter when my initial investment gets up to 400% - Get your original investment back + some profit.
Then, sell a quarter every time it doubles.
So how does that translate in numbers:
Sell a quarter at $10000, get $2500.
When the remaining $7500 doubles to $15000, sell a quarter ($3750)
When remaining $11250 doubles to $22500, sell a quarter (+/-$5600)
When the remaining $16900 doubles to $33800, sell a quarter (+/-$8450)
Etc Etc
So after a few cycles you've got $33800 in value and you've taken out $20300. 
If I just hold the same bitcoins, I have $60,000 total value. So for the sake of about $6000 worse off, I've enjoyed $20k worth and I'm still invested with a pretty decent amount.

My thoughts about this - what happens if all miners mine in the way the exploit describes? Then either nobody wins, or it all balances out again.
Another option is including some form of time-stamping in deciding if a block is accepted, for example a miner could choose to exclude a block which is more than 5 minutes old.
Although, not sure if this "vulnerability" actually is....

Ok point of information.
Paragraph 22. "CoinLab also offered Mt. Gox the ability to service North American customers in a manner that it could not otherwise achieve."
This somwhat contradicts Paragraph 24. "Defendants have breached the exclusivity provisions of the Agreement by directly servicing customers in the United States and Canada since the Agreement took effect."
The purpose of the agreement is clearly meant to reflect the receipt of customers funds into US bank accounts - Mt.Gox doesn't have US bank accounts, therefore can't be contravening the agreement.

Governments will no doubt be all over it as we speak. They will be looking for a way to challenge bitcoins, but they will also be looking for a way to "get along" with bitcoins. The former possibly as a knee jerk reaction, and the latter as a "necessary evil" considering on a long-term basis their hands are tied.

A year ago I bought some bitcoins for $10 after spending two weeks reading about this incredible new currency and transaction technology... today one bitcoin is worth $1000 - But it is still extremely early days and 99% of society still doesn't understand how revolutionary this technology is, the world is still filled with mistrust, and not a single government has figured out exactly what to do with/about it. Sentiment is slowly changing to that of support as key people in positions of power take the first baby steps towards understanding the technology, and realise how overwhelmingly positive it will be for what we now know as "money". There is still a lot of resistance too, but universally only from people who haven't taken the time to actually understand what they're talking about. The technology is so staggeringly transformative that money can literally never be the same again, just like the postal system gave way to email. So if that's where we are now, where will we be when 10% of people understand bitcoin? One day I hope we find out, but for now I'm pretty chuffed ...

Your numbers are a tad arbitrary...

In the same time, Total transaction value has gone up from $2.5mil/day, to $70mil/day - growth of 28 multiples, as opposed to your metric shrinking 6 fold.

There is a very legitimate discussion here, however KYC/AML laws will trickle down since if bitcoin = money and litecoin = money then bitcoin -&gt; litecoin is money transmission. Also trading one coin for another doesn't in and of itself hide the flow of money.

If I invest 10% of my money in bitcoins, I would consider that a "losable" amount - but I will never lose ALL of it. At this stage its unlikely I'll ever lose more than 7.5% of my total money (75% of what I invested in bitcoin) - but the potential upside is life changing. At the current rate my 10% will match and exceed all of my other savings in about a year, and be worth 10x more in two years. 10 years down the line, that initial investment of 10% of my wealth, could equal retirement.
In that sense, losing 10% is no big deal, but gaining 10,000% is massive.

Pricing models should be optionally locked to either USD, or BTC. a BTC service (like satoshi dice) will want to advertise in BTC, because their profits are in BTC. Another retailer will want to lock in with USD.
In terms of buying space, follow a pseudo-adwords style supply/demand model. Top bidders get priority of traffic, and then when their budgets are gone, the next highest paying advertiser gets advertising space. You should be able to track CTR's fairly easily, and maximise total advert clicks across the whole network on that basis.

I hope not... I prefer big price gains on big volume... the price gain is too high for the current volume IMHO... and I don't think that is a good thing.
I think volume and price increase need to go hand in hand or we are at risk of looking like a bubble.

My company shipped £1500 of products to a customer recently, who then denied they ordered the items and then issued a chargeback.

This is why I like the bitcoins concept.

Might I suggest that whatever solution you come up with, you ensure it is severely future proof. You can easily expect 10x more trade volume within the next 12 months, and 10x in the 12 months following, so a solution which will last 2 years, needs to be 100 times over capacity. A solution to last three years needs to be 1000 times over capacity.

A year ago I bought some bitcoins for $10 after spending two weeks reading about this incredible new currency and transaction technology... today one bitcoin is worth $1000 - But it is still extremely early days and 99% of society still doesn't understand how revolutionary this technology is, the world is still filled with mistrust, and not a single government has figured out exactly what to do with/about it. Sentiment is slowly changing to that of support as key people in positions of power take the first baby steps towards understanding the technology, and realise how overwhelmingly positive it will be for what we now know as "money". There is still a lot of resistance too, but universally only from people who haven't taken the time to actually understand what they're talking about. The technology is so staggeringly transformative that money can literally never be the same again, just like the postal system gave way to email. So if that's where we are now, where will we be when 10% of people understand bitcoin? One day I hope we find out, but for now I'm pretty chuffed ... seriously, take the time to learn about bitcoin!

Mark Karpeles witnessed his own signatures - which makes the contract very weak in the first instance.

@_date: 2013-12-06 14:03:40
The two problems with this case, which make it a non starter are:
On June 18th when the hardware was ordered, the total order value was around $9200
Terrahash was presumably let down by Avalon for supply of chips and incurred costs in the development process regardless. As such they made reasonable efforts, but the business simply failed. 
At most the dude might get $9k (depending on the limited liability nature of the Terrahash company structure) and at worst the dude invested in a super high risk purchase through a group buy, and gets nothing.
It actually looks like Terrahash tried to refund about 50% to investors, but this would have been the USD value, not the BTC value.
My gut feeling is, this "investor" is greedy and butthurt (although losing 50% isn't nice)

In theory any wallet service should be able to instantly confirm transactions, although this relies on trusting the wallet service.

Unfortunately Mt.Gox is still the best option... they are just too flippant with that responsibility.

I assume the same rules that apply for exchanging GBP cash for USD cash apply to USD/BTC - Probably there is a limit on transaction value. For example in the UK I can exchange £500 for Euro's without any tax, registering, etc.
