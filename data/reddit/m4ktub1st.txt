It would be strange to have most blocks tagged with NYA and then go answer "No" in Luke's poll. So my guess is not miners voted and that makes a difference. 
I have no idea who voted in that pool but the network is not symmetric and miners have a special role in it. If a third of the miners run Segwit2X then a network that processes as many transactions as Bitcoin will exist. Note that you don't need that many non-mining full nodes to accept Segwit2X for it to be completely functional.
So, with 12% of non-mining nodes running Segwit2X, 1 CPU = 1 vote is pretty much valid. In your example, if the military decided to run 50% of the hash power and started with 12% of the nodes on the network they wouls pretty much define Bitcoin. Off course that is assuming the military ignore economic incentives. Also, the military have easier ways to screw with Bitcoin.

A quantum computer is expected to make addresses less secure but nothing radical and without ways to mitigate. This has been askes a few times, you can check 
But the main thing is, when you get two quantum computers how probable do you think it is for a miner to have more? And how difficult would it be to change the signature to be more resistant? I would say that a quantum attack requires a stealth quantum computer to be developed and then targeted at Bitcoin to probably steal a few million. Not a very practical use for the first quantum computer, specially because it will cost quite a lot.

Someone had a similar idea, 6 years ago. Mining pools were started. You need to improve your idea 10 fold to have something interesting by next year. 
For something more constructive: 
It allows a server node to coordinate client miners. A good connection does not hurt when you want to see lol cat videos and it certainly does not hurt in this case either.

I would say some hash rate support is possible. Price support I'm not so sure because movements in exchanges might be traced. What Jihan apparently did was tour places like South Korea. Coincidence or not a lot of support for Bitcoin Cash came from Korean exchanges.

Services that signed NYA are looking for **their** users, as they should. Also the lack of replay protection means it's a fight for the BTC/XBT ticker and not an altcoin. I don't see a B2X ticker be listed anywhere. 
For all the other users they can do as OP or provide mining power. One CPU one vote, right?

I believe the plan is not to use a S2X coin and instead use BTC all the way through. If the price rises or drops it affects all.

The same argument could be played the other way around. If most miners run 2X then core nodes will be executing a sort of denial of service. Transactions will still be relayed but some issues may occur. A bit like spinning 10000 new nodes now that do not relay blocks and do no accept the connection of some peers, for example.

The trick is then to hodl both and break even. ;)

The case of Bitcoin Cash is different. It was a ver explicit hard fork with replay protection. Meant to be completely separate. That makes it safe for miners to switch. This fork is different and switching between btc1 and core will only increase the problem because all nodes will still be connected and relaying transactions to both sides.

The difference between 8MB and 1MB is not 7MB :). The difference is the strategy you use to take the whole world.
The official (my take as official, at least) response to you scenario is that neither will fail to take the whole world. Bitcoin will have most transactions go through side-chains like LN and Bitcoin Cash will continually increase the block size.
Increasing the block size limit in Bitcoin is as hard as decreasing the limit in Bitcoin Cash. It goes against the very ideology behind the fork.

They are lost in the sense no one can spend them.
The thing is Bitcoin has a finite amount, but is divisible.
1 Bitcoin is actually 100 million satoshi, the smallest unit of the network. If someday 1 Bitcoin is worth 1 million, a satoshi will be worth 1 cent. At that time, the precision can be increased (make Bitcoin more divisible) and that would function as an increase in supply. So,in theory, you could have started with 1 Bitcoin.

To be honest I've been there. Never called it a ponzi scheme but surely predicted it's demise. Then I realized that I was comparing Bitcoin with classical financial systems like banks and I believe that's what is still happening a lot. Bitcoin allows a new way of thinking and organizing money. Even popular services like Coinbase emulate the banking system so I guess it takes time to settle. Like in the Internet the time it took to go from portals to social sites.

Solo mining means you must find a block. Otherwise you have no reward. It's like playing a lottery that only has the first prize. That's why it's all or nothing.
To give you an idea of the numbers, with 14 TH/s the  "normal" time to find a block is 12 years or more. Obviously, you can get lucky like in the lottery but don't count on it. If you join a pool you can receive something like 0.002 BTC per day.

Not exactly. A plutocracy does not imply your money is at stake. The wealthy rule just by being wealthy and through use of their wealth. In fact, a plutocracy typically works to protect the money of the rulers.
To be a plutocracy you would need to see something like 1 satoshi one vote regardless of the address that spends that satoshi.

You can see your ~$700 there. Typically, in an online wallet, it can take a few confirmations (blocks being found) before the deposit is shown.
I don't know bch-wallet and I hope it works fine for you but it seems a bit edgy. Maybe it was rushed to be up soon. Still, the site was registered 8 days ago and claims 1M users.

It depends on what you mean as "understand". Do you understand how a phone works? 
So I would say yes. It's possible to create a mental model of Bitcoin that contains all the relevant properties a little technicalities. Just enough to, for example, explain other people. That's the best exercise, try to explain Bitcoin to others and answer their questions without going "merkel tree sha256 eliptic curve ocus pocus bitcoin, get it? " :)

The main "versus" between BTC and BCC is how to allow more transactions in the network. In BTC the answer is "with lighting network". In BCC the answer is "by increasing the block". The merits and demerits of each answer have been spoken many times.
Segwit was presented as a way to enable lightning network and also increase the block size. The number 1.7x is the estimated size increase at the ens of 2016. Now is more like 2.1x. Segwit is different discussion altogether although it got mixed in the scaling debate due to that size increase factor.   As you noted, even 2.1x is a modest increase and points to that not being the main goal of segwit.

Yes. I'm being particularly moderate here but you can see my comment history. 
In a world without altcoins BCH would be extremely well positioned as digital currency. Now there are quite the number of options. Still, there are things that only a billion dollars valuation can bring to the table and in that sense BCH is a safer bet.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:47:28
3) Yes, it's possible. My opinion is that it is unlikely as the focus is on providing other solutions like Lightning Network. But it's also challenging to tell how likely this scenario is and it's one of the main points of discussion in the last years.
5) Bitcoin Cash is aligned with what your're saying. You will hear stuff like "using hard forks to remove technical debt". But when you think long term you have to define your long term goals. That's where the projects differ. Bitcoin Cash values day to day usage, while BTC values decentralization (in the sense that every user can participate with a node because it's not that expensive to run a node). Also, Bitcoin Cash will never introduce SegWit.


Because there is no such thing as on the fly software patch in Bitcoin. Being decentralized has a lot of advantages but ease of upgrade is not one of them. And the complexity of a change is not that important in comparison with the time needed to coordinate the network to upgrade. If anything SegWit2X is a sign that upgrading Bitcoin is an open problem and people are still learning from trials.
Still, Bitcoin Cash is aligned with what you're saying. If upgrading is always difficult then let's do it cleanly. Core is more of the line that "soft-forks" with opt-in mechanisms are better because upgrades are easier to roll out and no one is left behind (although you get some technical baggage). Segwit2X, as said before is a compromise, so it gets the worst of both worlds, in the upgrade department. :)

Let's just say that's not the best TL;DR the world has seen. 
This update may be relevant:


@_date: 2017-10-08 17:12:58
1) Bitcoin does not have a transaction congestion problem now. But if you look at historical graphs you can see that the trend was an increase in transactions up to the point where the 1MB ceiling was reached (see blocksize over time). Many parties wanted a scaling solution before that ceiling was reached. Unfortunately tgis was not possible.
2) Yes. Not including SegWit was a defining point of Bitcoin Cash. You can look at the site. It may change but it is stated that SegWit will never be introduced.
3) SegWit helps with congestion as it allows more transactions to be processed in the same 1MB limit. But it requires adoption so it's effects are not immediate. As you mention, SegWit is pretty much there to stay. 
4) The 2X part, duplicate the block size to 2M is not supported by Bitcoin Core. Core's strategy is to let SegWit adoption develop and see, after it stabilizes, it's true effect on the network before deciding the next step like a 2X. So this change will not be included in Core for now.
5) The 2X supporters see SegWit + 2X as a package that was agreed together. The 3 months between SegWit activation and the 2X hard fork was only for practical reasons. Since Core will not include the change 2X supporters, which may include the majority of miners, are planning to introduce a new node implementation and apply that rule towards the end of November (21st?). The hard fork was always planned but initially they expected the change to be includedin Bitcoin Core. 
I've basically rewrote your points in my words to make it easier to explain how I see it. The whole scaling debate resolved in three camps: 1) Those that want to preserve backwards compatibility and belirve every node counts, 2) those that want to increase blocksize and believe miner nodes are more important, and 3) those that feel any solution that increases the value of Bitcoin is a valid compromise.
So Bitcoin Cash is the result of a group of people not compromising on the scaling problem. It's a technical fork where segwit is not included and the blocksize is increased. Segwit2X is more of a political fork and much more nuanced. Segwit2X supporters could say Bitcoin Core is also a group of people not compromising on the scaling problem while Segwit2X supporters can also be accused of forcing an hard fork where no compromise is really needed; that the agreement that was signed is void since the part that wanted the blocksize increase already has Bitcoin Cash. Still, saying Segwit2X is an attack on Bitcoin is ignoring the last 2 years of history.

You deposit, money arrives destination, destination says "nope, not here yet", you say "I know it's there", they say "right, here it is, out bad". In the meantime it has disappeared, it's a "ghost" deposit. It's either a true glitch, incompetence, or malice. Hard to prove malice.
Confs are confirmations in the block chain. You make the transfer. It gets included in a block, 1 confirmation. Other block is found, 2 confirmations (because, there's a block on top of the one with your transfer which double confirms it as valid). And sk kn, and so on.
