There is no "central controlling authority" that can shut down the Bitcoin network. There is a very small group of very trustworthy people who are very dedicated to the growth and advancement of Bitcoin who have the ability to send out messages that will be displayed at the bottom of the Bitcoin client, in case there is an emergency of some sort. 
This power will most likely never be used, and would probably only be used if there is a serious emergency. Even if you kidnapped and tortured Gavin Andreson and forced him to give up the key, nothing could be done with it to *shut down* the Bitcoin network.

I think you a word.

The FED is a "very small group of very trustworthy people who are very dedicated to the growth and advancement of [the US economy]", but they have complete control of it. The few people with this alert system have very little control over it. All that they can do is send out alerts to users. 
The mandatory transaction fees are to avoid DDoS attacks. 
For the most part, it doesn't need a central authority in the same way that the FED is. It needs a couple of people to control the direction that the development of the software takes. They don't necessarily control the network itself. They just control the software, which controls the network.

Mybitcoin.com was basically the same as the traditional Bitcoin client, but the interface was in a web browser, and the coins were kept on a real wallet on a server somewhere. It made it easier to send coins from a phone (most phones can't run the traditional Bitcoin client, but they can run a perfectly good browser with ease). 
It definitely could have stored them on an isolated machine. 
He didn't say if that 25,000 BTC was his entire savings. It was definitely at least most of his savings. 25,000 BTC is *a lot* of money. At the moment, it's worth over USD$270,000.

Honestly, I believe that Bitcoin is going to continue to catch on quickly, and that means that $20M today in BTC could become $40M in a year. Remember that only a few months ago 1 Bitcoin was worth less than $5, and now it's bumping around $12-15. It's pretty likely that it'll grow substantially in the near future.

I made the same mistake and it took me forever to figure out how to fix it. For some reason, you NEED to use the most recent version, or it will stay at 0 connections and 0 blocks. I don't know why this is, but I could never get that version to work. I tried everything and I couldn't get it to work, and then I updated and it worked perfectly. 
I believe the most recent version right now is 0.3.23. That's the version that I'm using and it works just fine. 
Once you've downloaded the entire block chain, it usually takes about 2-10 seconds for a transaction to show up in the client. It's actually surprisingly fast for a p2p service. 
Edit: Yes, I was right. The most recent version is 0.3.23. Use that. You can get it at

We should actually assume that difficulty will go up, because it has been going up steadily for a very long time. 
Still, that just means that there might be a 9-month return or a 12-month return.

OK, you got me. It's not *perfect*.

So now I can do the same thing that I can do with any mobile Bitcoin client, but now it's mixed with the crappy security and constant downtime of Mt Gox. I bet this thing'll take off fast!

Well, it could be infinite. It just depends on how much processing power is put into mining. 
Probably a lot.

Write it on a piece of paper. I have a piece of paper with the password sitting at the bottom of my top desk drawer. It drives me crazy when people say that they can't remember a password. Write it down. Problem solved. 
There's no need to worry about any of it. A piece of paper is perfectly secure. There's no virus that's good enough to read what's on the paper in your desk drawer.
