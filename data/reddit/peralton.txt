Yes, rare, but not unheard of. [Stephen Glass]( wrote fake stories for three years for The New Republic. 27 of 41 articles he wrote were fabricated.

I stopped reading at this point because I assumed the article was a fiction about what it would be like to actually find the creator of bitcoin. I can never be convinced some random cop, even in a tech area, would make that statement. Even if they knew about bitcoin, nothing in the reporter's statement would indicate that the person they were looking for should have a lot of money and be living better. 
Also, the reporter goes to the house, the guy calls the cops and they stand around waiting for the cops to show up? The cops stick around long enough for this guy to say he has no statement and then the cops say that the interview is over? Where can I get that kind of personalized police service? 
Seriously, the first scene strained credulity so much I assumed it was fake, like that recent article about some hypothetical google employee making an unchecked code change that messed up their system.

But there's a bigger leap to accept. That's 1. that the cop knows bitcoin and 2. knows the name Satoshi Nakamoto and 3. knows that SN reportedly has $400mil in bitcoin and 4. then makes a judgement call on his lifestyle. I'll toss in 5. that he would form a sentence like that, but I know quotes are often messed up, so I'll let it slide.
