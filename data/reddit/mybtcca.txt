Client didn't read where it said that his first transaction would be held until manually approved on the homepage, payment page and FAQ section and then when he noticed that it would be held he took to reviews thinking he could bully us into an answer he wanted during this extremely busy period -- for all in the industry.  He demanded we send his Bitcoin ASAP before others in the queue or else he will continue to write negative reviews until received. These form of threats and bullying to attempt to gets ones way is unacceptable.  The client also sent numerous emails with content that coveys they will defame and extort us if we do not follow his orders.  As such a file has been created and passed to legal for review.  We have thousands of delighted customers but there's always around 1 out of a 1,000 who ruin it for themselves.  In any case, the client will receive a refund as soon as possible, definitely within 30 days.
