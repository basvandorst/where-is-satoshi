Bitpay seems quite easy to use.

Alright I guess I should contact my VPN client?
Thank you!

That would be a good idea, but when I say programmer I should specify I'm not that experienced at all. I just said that to imply that I have an ok knowledge of the internet/computers etc.

If I 'slag off' something it means I'm saying it's shit.
If I call someone a 'slag' it means they are a horrible person.

I dont think thats how it works. That doesnt matter as whatever i do my bitcoin client will be listening on a port that isn't 8333. This means other clients will not sync with mine as they are not running on my port.

I can map the vpn forwarded port to 8333 internal port so its the same for my bitcoin client. So i dont need to change the config file (i believe). The problem is that i don't get inwards connections when i use the VPN, because other full nodes just see the VPN forwarded port which is something other than 8333.
