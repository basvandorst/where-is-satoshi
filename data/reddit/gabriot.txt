It went from ~700 to ~19k during 2018, is 100k really that unbelievable?

Ok well how about oh I don't know the U.S. for starters, I hear there are lot of people from there on here.

This and all other crypto subreddits have been infested by idiots who invested from 10k on up and have ZERO idea how truly volatile crypto is compared to fiat.  The usual January dip happens and it's now "red tuesday" and "the crash".  Fucking morons, I can't stand being on any of these subs, at least mods are doing a decent job of cleaning up the trash so I'll give it to them, and they're focusing on positive topics usually tech related.  I honestly hope all these idiots acting like it's the end of the world sell and just leave the world of crypto for several years, but I know that when it rises back up come February the cycle will repeat.

I know that every year you won't see any real gains till maybe summer if you're lucky, but pretty much always the oct-nov-dec is when you see your investment pay off.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:10:49
You just have no idea what you are talking about on so many levels.  I don't even know where to begin with this.  I'll see you in 8 months.

This isn't just a bitcoin thing, this is the cycle of ALL cryptocurrencies thus far, january ALWAYS experiences htis.  If you want to buy low, now is the time, because this shit rises back up again from Feb on out
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:54:10
they have shills in this sub hardcore
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:55:53
Where's your evidence that it is a "fed inside job"?

Coinbase's UX is about as simple as it gets, if the UX is the selling point for it I don't really see that as a reason to switch... what about the length of time for your transactions to go through?  Do they sit pending for multiple weeks like Coinbase does?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:14
relax bro, it will go back up well above that.  Were you not there when it dropped down to nearly 5k less than amonth ago?  In a few years don't be surprised if it is worth 6 figures of USD fiat.

How do you move money over go Gemini?
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:55:11
I dunno... usually we see an uptick starting August, I’m not so happy about this latest dip
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:56:19
nobody cares*
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:39:25
The pattern hasn’t always been so similar, there were times that august saw a rise.  The real constant is that november and december always see meteoric rise.  Let’s hope this year is no different

If you think bitcoin is bad, imagine investing in any crypto other than bitcoin in the last year

No kidding, I could just as easily show a slide consisting of HD DVDs, beta tapes, the Virtual Boy, and a whole host of other "next big things" that never took off.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:14:35
So why not just use litecoin for that?

Looks like you need to educate yourself on what an "ad hominem attack" is.  All I ever said is he should sell now because this shit is not for him.  I explained why he is not cut out for this, and tacked on cupcake at the end.  Tacking on a personal attack does not make something ad hominem, it's only ad hominem if the only argument you have is just a personal attack.  Let me know if you still don't understand, I can maybe try to find some wooden ABC blocks to break it down for you.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:42:04
He has no point, the fact he legitimately believes it is MORE likely that crypto goes to a worth of zero dollars than not shows just how clueless he is, and at any rate he obviously doesn’t believe in crypto at all if that’s really what he (incredibly stupidly) believes.  He got in late thinking he could get rich quick and probably hasn’t read a white paper in his life and probably can’t tell you at all the trends of crypto in years past around this time in the year.  He’s an amateur, and he’s not cut out for this.  Cupcake needs to get out and leave it to the professionals.

And we learn that bitcoin is a bad investment in comparison
@_date: 2019-01-27 18:56:01
yet the value of btc continues to plummet
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:18:08
The sad thing is there are probably a decent amount of people that just saw this title and bought btc simply based on the number of upvotes and never actually checked the content.

You should just sell now, you clearly aren’t cut out for this.
