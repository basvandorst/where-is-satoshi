Is there any way to know how much actual money are circulating in crypto market?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:02:05
Dude don't be naive about other peoples posts, same as I am not about yours.
And the only historical trend is 2013 $100-&gt;$1000 bubble, which bursted into $230 half a year later. HODLERS had to wait 4 years with their frozen assets just to go equal.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:48:12
How is the waiting thing going on?
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:37:51
These "smart" HODLERS should start adding yearly dollar inflation costs to their going equal price checkpoint :)

I don't understand how can 10 billion become ~500 billion?
If people (put/invest/buy crypto) for 10 billion in crypto market, market cap should increase by 10 billion, because there are 10 billion extra dollars floating in it, it can't expand into non existing 500 billion market cap.
Fcuk, while typing this comment i started to understand what you talking about and how market can actually balloon with non existent value, but please explain more.

16k couple months ago will be equal 19k in 5 years due to inflation. You will need 19k just to go equal.

Bullruns happened 2 times as far as I know in 9 years of Bitcoin and that is why I am confident its not gonna happen in next 3 months.
I think people here don't even know what bullrun is. They think it's some magic or something which occurs by itself. And its not, its fukcing social event of greed.

I am pretty sure that some crypto currency will become future currency of our world too. The only 2 questions are - which currency and when?
The currency may not even be created yet, something like United nations may create the perfect currency for the world. And it won't happen in 2-5 years, it will happen in 50-100-200 years.

First - You are wrong again and as usual, I am from EU.
Second - I traveled weeks and thousands and thousands kilometers in Russia with a backpack I know the country, its cities, and its people pretty well and I can compare it with other countries pretty well, can you say the same?
What you know about US debt? that 60%+ it owes it to itself? that 30% it owes to allies and only 10% to potential rivals? US debt contracts are well protected with time based manners, returns in US dollars(which makes it even stronger), taxes with returns to US treasury and so on. Let me tell you not everyone in this world is such fool like yourself.
Russia is richest country - are you totally out of you mind? How the f... then Russia managed to save only $500bils in 15 years, when China saves as much in 1 year, even Norway has 1 trillion dollars saved.. Where the f.. are you making your statements from? Maybe you are talking about fossil fuel reserves? WHICH ENTIRE WORLD IS MOVING AWAY FROM AND WILL DECREASE DEMAND IN COMING DECADES DRAMATICALLY! Also in our planet 2/3 money generated comes from services, 5% from agriculture and only 30% from all industries in the world including natural resources. Just look at stupid GDP if u even know what it stand for and you will see which countries makes money and which doesn't. Also Russia is first only in natural gas which are cheap and fills its budget 4 times less than oil, but Saudi has 3 times more oil than Russia, Venezuela has 4 times as much.. As you can see now, making your stupid statements only made you look like retard in all its essence, who doesn't have a single clue what he is talking about..
I can bet you 10BTC that in 2-3 years US will be as healthy economically as it is today, I would bet more if I had any and saying otherwise just based on US controlled debt is plain retarded in general.
Based on this comment you aren't just lunatic, u are also 100% stupid as an individual and that's not an insult that's a fact.
@_date: 2019-02-08 09:32:54
Mr. I barely can understand your comment and you making statements without any arguments makes it even harder to coup with you.
"Digital scarcity is either worthless, or worth everything" What the f... is that? Based on what are you making that statement mr.?
"Except instead of weight gain or stocks it a decentralized currency, so your analogies are meaningless." Why its meaningless? Again zero arguments.. Clearly Ms. Alice you don't understand that we aren't living in some magical world without limits, that there is only so much fat you can add to your body, there is only so much value you can add to some single store of value, there is only so much profit company can make. Some people get it, some people don’t.

Bullshit, I don't know China personally, but I know Russia for sure. And when I read about Russia taking over I am 100% certain, guy is full of shit. 50 millions russians doesn't even have toilets at their home..
This guy doesn't even get his fact from media, he sees media and interprets it, if media talks about Russia a lot it doesn't mean its worth talking about, but this guy interprets all the talk as super Russia (victim of media in general).
"for centuries they are all moving to China, they know that their horse is old and done. " more bullshit..
TLDR: Post made by lunatic.

your weight went from 0.001g to 100kg(100000x), so going from 100kg to 2000kg(20x) should be peace of cake for you, it sounds ultimately less crazier.. So go do it. Achieve 2000kg(no matter that heaviest man on planet is only 600kg) body weight and prove us all wrong with your super logic..

This article is so stupid, its 100% propaganda, its based on differentiating same multiplier as 2 separate values, and sectioning it at for you comfortable position so the upper value would look easier to achieve.
Its same as saying - your weight went from 0.001g to 100kg(100000x), so going from 100kg to 2000kg(20x) sounds ultimately less crazy.. Ye right.. try to increase your weight at least 8x..

You refuse to stop surprising me with your extraordinary intellect :) Keep going :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:14:50
You are right, but bitcoin price is based on only how much people are ready to pay for them. And if demand gets stale i expected still to be in a good place, because of natural bitcoin deflation, saving 2-3% every year and naturally hoping for the price going up, now I see that I was wrong all along, I don't really see anything at the moment that would push price up at least a little.
I thought its safe 2-3 years investment, but looks like it very well may not be.

You are wrong on this one. TCP/IP will for sure go away when we need it, its 2 layer protocol IP - for addressing and TCP for data transfer architecture. IP already switching from v4 to v6 which is totally different addressing protocol and we have no problem at all to do so. And we will drop TCP for QUIC in upcoming years because it better suits our internet needs. All we need for that is browser and web-server support. Btw if you are using Chrome and google something you already use QUIC instead of TCP. So TCP/IP is already going away for you and you aren't even noticing.
Have a nice day.

Just because of inflation factor and how many people are in it, I am pretty sure it will go up.
Trading can be manipulated, because there is no actual correlation between short/long and price. 1'000 people can short 10'000'000. The manipulator buys for bigger price and u get long and lose everything.
When you short you aren't actually buying anything except your speculation and your speculation actual worth is $0, so it can be manipulated easily.
I rather buy low and have actual liquidity like bitcoins, which are worth at least something by agreement between millions of people.
I don't know if i make any sense at all, but I am trying my best.
So you are actually day trading right? Where you bet on one thing or another?

You are wrong. In essence by supply demand laws both control the value. But generally buyer controls maximum value, seller controls minimum value. In reality buyer is always ready to buy at 0-Maxvalue. But in your case buyer would be like Bitcoin price 200$, oh no it's too low i am waiting until price goes to 1000$ then i am buying, and seller would be Bitcoin price is 100'000$ its too high will wait till price drops to 10'000$ to sell :D

Bitcoin didn't dropped from 1000 to 200, it bubbled from 130 to 1100 in a month and then corrected itself over the year to 200. That's what I see now. Its been a thousand for a couple of days, while it was 130-200 for months and years.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:37:33
Me not just shocked, but scared also. I predicted 10k by the end of the year, and thought that lowest possible ever for Bitcoin is 3.5k, because there are a lot of hodlers and they control min value.

I love when all experts in articles here are simple Bitcoin investors and talk exceptionally positively about Bitcoin, like 50k by end of 2018 in June article.
I am always like - "no sh1t, what else they are going to say?", would like to see more neutral experts opinions here.
Wouldn't you agree?
