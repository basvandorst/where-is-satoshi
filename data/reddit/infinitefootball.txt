It will happen sooner than you think.

Buy more. That's the answer.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:56:37
Do you plan on increasing what you hold in the meantime?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:11:10
I am with you sir. This coin is not going below $3k ever again. A new era is upon us. Join or die.

not at all childish and petty. read the top comment and you will see why. That is a piece of propaganda and he is 100% right to remove such garbage from the San Francisco streets. What a fucking joke BCash is. This type of shit proves it.

Putting up flyers that contain misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:30:33
If you send me 10 btc, I'll use 5 btc of it to buy coke and hookers for you :)
fair enough?

The flyer has the title of 'Bitcoin Cash' which would lead you to believe the flyer is about Bitcoin Cash. Next, the flyer gives you the definition of bitcoin and what it is used for. After that it links you to bitcoin cash websites.

Two questions: 
1) Who sets these up (could I set one up)?
2) Who owns the BTC being obtained in these things?

lmao. I was just being funny.

Welcome to crypto. The only logic here is the code running the nodes. Logic doesn't exist in the market.

You can just take your government loving self down to the river and chuck yourself right on in. I ain't giving em nothing. Not my btc gains. Not my sports betting winnings. Not my jiggalo income. Nothing.

Pretty sure he's talking about reading them into his algorithm.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:12:51
Thinking exactly the same as you because well... it's worth the risk. ~$1k risk to possibly net much more. I'll take that bet.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:13:13
No idea when it will be but buy in the next dip.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:08:22
Exact same situation bud. Let me know what you decide. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:37:02
Agreed. I don't know if this is a winnable fight though.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:20:26
We are not in a bubble. I repeat, we are not in a fucking bubble. Crypto is going to explode and this is only the beginning. If another major country does what Japan has recently done for btc then imagine what that could do to the price.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:25:20
So you're gonna throw more money away?
