The op didn’t state it as fact. Charts are one of many (inaccurate) methods to predict price movements.
A lot of people here get so personally insulted if you suggest the price will drop even in a temporary capacity.

This is fucking lame. Only an idiot would accept a one word statement without justification.
Unless you are also paid.
It would actually be incredibly convenient for me if the price were to drop. I currently hold zero bitcoin.

It doesn’t matter what you are exchanging for your btc, could be dollars, ETH or sheep. It’s the same, you are gaining or losing btc.
If you’re using an exchange, they have a stash of all the assets. They are the Market Maker. You are doing your transaction with them. Almost instantaneously they are performing a similar transaction for someone else. It’s just a giant merry go round of assets with the exchange taking a cut for very single transaction.

Because you said ‘us’ implying I am the only one with this opinion.
But I take you’re point, I was being a dick.
Ok, so it’s not bad advice in context for a specific use case. But it’s bad advice unless you know the context of the investor. It’s certainly not ‘financial advice’.
I have problems with cost/averaging.  The upward swings are so high right now, even if you invested 100% at the all time high, you’d still come off better.
If split your investment into 12 and bought monthly each purchase could be at a new ATH every single month.
Now I’m a downward marker averaging can help.
I’m interested in other views too.
I’m currently 1/3 in bitcoin, 2/3 fiat in the exchange
and waiting for a way back in. (Sold at 10,500).

An Angel investor will hedge his bets.
Most will fail. A few need to be milked to pay for all the others. 
It’s all too easy to cash out early and lose out.
Having said that, 4x is good going. What’s the point making yourself ill?
It’s ok to derisk a little. E.g. sell 50% now. Worst case you have your original investment. 
If/when a sharp temporary correction happens you will also have liquid funds to jump back in at a lower price.

@_date: 2017-12-05 10:12:08
Dangerous. Anything speculative is dangerous by definition. Full marks here.
Speculative. That’s an objective term. Noobs are speculative, the more seasoned coiners might just know what they are talking about... no marks here. That means if it’s not speculative after some research then he loses marks for dangerous.
Bubble. Everything goes up and down. That’s not a bubble. The crypto is too big to fail now. It’s impossible to stop. There will be crashes and there will be recoveries. So no points for bubble.
Whilst I’m sick to death of the cheerleaders on this sub (partly why I change my name) I’m just as sick of historic experts who can only consider the world they have experienced and text books and not have any understanding of disruption and change.

I imagine most retail outlets fix the price in local fiat. The bitcoin price will fluctuate as often it is converted to fiat instantly. If you wanted a refund you may well get it in fiat, or bitcoin at the new Rae of exchange.
According to my wife, I have been wrong before.

It will probably go up :)
And a financial bod will tell you to hold as the return could well be greater that way.
But that’s not human, and it’s still a risk.
I never had students debts in the extortionate way people do today, but I’ve a feeling I took a small loan at a higher rate just just to be rid of it. I probably borrowed extra rather than a loan specifically for that purpose. Idiocy but felt good.
I’ve recently sold shares in a startup and I was lucky enough to pay off my mortgage. That was the right thing to paychologically (spell check is failing me) and for my family. Financially it was terrible as mortgage interest rates are low and I could have invested and got a greater return.
Actually these stories are nothing alike. Mine was risk free - yours still had significant risk, making it a much better move.
Once again, congrats on buying yourself a salary increase. You can now use that to invest for a house.
Question: if price drops &lt;10k will you buy back in? Either the full amount? The same number of coin and keep the change? Or half?

It’s not 10k for a digital check. Your entire premise is flawed.
If you’re lucky you can get back in.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:14:35
You need to qualify your statement.
Otherwise you are a paid actor manipulating the price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:09
Because they can’t possibly imagine losing their private keys.
Or their wallets get hacked.
Or the exchange goes bust.
Or they make a typo with the destination key.
The list goes on...

THats quite cool. 
I can’t answer your question.
All I can say is I only ever print keys on my personal printer and I’ll be careful when it reaches end of life.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:46:31
And if you don’t have it, why not?
Oh and will you “upgrade” for a 3?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:13:56
Congrats. You’ve 60 times your investment. That’s quite a rarity for any investor.
Perhaps the problem is lack of diversification.

I guess he’s not wrong
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:15:37
About that ;)
Prob made 7% really hard to tell after all the fees.
To be honest I’d gambled far too much anyway and a derisk was right for me, although I’d like to pick up some alt coins.
(I only sold 1/3rd in case I implied I was all out)
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:23:56
Stating a fact about the wealth of banks doesn’t back up whatever wishy washy argument you are trying to make.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:29:57
You won’t get an objective response here :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:16:16
Smells fishy

You made 5500? Nice work!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:01:28
I don’t follow why you’re sure it’s manipulation?

This is a big and overlooked obstical for mass adoption.

Coinbase. I’d sell you some via local bitcoins but I don’t trust you :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:05:32
Aww airheads. I could watch them all day.
Did they actually say anything?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:23:43
THis post needs bumping. I, too, overassumed the role of miners.
However suppose China shut down miners Bitcoin would be screwed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:41:35
I wasn’t hyping Coinbase 2 weeks ago.
Being top of the charts is a metric, not an opinion.
Coinbase has always been a croc of shit and cost me big yesterday. Yet I still use them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:52:44
Appreciated. People don’t react nicely to news they don’t want to hear.
Before anyone with blinkers on kicks off, this is just one metric, one method of making sense from data and reading charts and it’s not a prophecy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:54:46
What file (or other) are they looking for?
What can I do to protect myself further?
I don’t trust the software on hardware wallets.
They haven’t been out long enough to prove their reliability. And as if usb will still be around in 20 years ;)
The only safe method I can think of is to buy a budget laptop. Do the work including print. Destroy both laptop and printer.
I might buy a hardware wallet to figure out what they do. Then I’ll see up a rPi to do the same, that way the software and storage are in my control.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:55
Ditto. I drisked at 10.5 :)
I’m not sitting with my paper wallet in my hand literally gambling if I should sell. If I’m wrong I won’t be back. Too exhausting :)
Actually that’s not true, I’ll stick with alts and then move them Bitcoin to derisk the alt market.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:57:08
I’m not saying you are wrong, but I really really wish I could believe this

@_date: 2017-12-04 23:35:39
The only correct answer is, no one knows.

Who’s game ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:50:09
It’s sad that you have to explain before your peers bite your head off.

Good luck.

You’ve been a Redditor for 1 week but you at a minimum understand the basics of hashing.
I guess this proves the time on Reddit does not correlate to knowledge. You are welcome.

If you’ve lost your job and have a mortgage you will sell bitcoin to buy your struggling national currency and you’ll be grateful.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:44
Hmm good point. Whilst I can’t imagine any fork toppling any incumbents it’s still a free 5% to sell.
And then there’s the futures on the doorstep.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:09:56
And completely unforgiving. The slightest mistake and it’s in front of the world to criticise.
The BA does a shit job - the dev find out the missing details.
The PM does a shit job - the dev will work weekends.
The stakeholder doesn’t actually know what they want - the dev will figure it out 
You didn’t realise I meant this not that? It’s obvious!
You’re clarifying this fact over that? It’s obvious.
And don’t get me started on those lazy ducktards that are devops. Embedded in your team? Yeah right.
What was I saying?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:11
Ditto :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:15:11
This is hilarious. I’m not sure if you meant it that way.
I also set stock market funds to max. I guess I’ve never been burnt making me ignorant of stock markets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:23
That’s exactly what he was talking about,
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:17:55
I wondered about this.
On occasions someone will list their house for sale with bitcoins.
If I buy 1 @ 10k
And the value shoots up 10 times
Can I buy a 100k house with my 1 bitcoin?
Or is there cap gains or other tax on the 90k profit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:20:03
Wow. Just wow. But but but
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:40:42
Thanks I appreciate it. I haven’t read it yet as I’m watching the price drop in front of my eyes on gdax.
Is this what you were warning about ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:34:08
Only now confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:26:22
What does it mean?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:01:47
Yeah my deliveries go so well with arbitrary deadlines. :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:06:39

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:34:12
Can we stop with the cheerleading posts without any substance.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:52:52
More dry humping and pumping.
You really think that people believe you aren’t already 100% in?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:46:47
Fantastic outcome.
You’ve bought yourself a pay rise.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:13:39
The demand isn’t off the charts. It’s only slightly higher than the supply. That’s why the increase isn’t off the charts.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:16:52
It’s not for everyone 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:48:02
I don’t negativity. As long as it’s qualified. It’s just the endless trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:29:28
Ah ha I think this answer my question about buying a physical house with bitcoin.
It also makes day trading less worthwhile if I sell from a Coinbase wallet and store the cash in a Coinbase cash wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:38:09
To me HODL means don’t day trade. You can’t beat the pros, unless very lucky.
If the price drops, it will plummet in minutes if not seconds. HODL means don’t panic, don’t sell, it is just a tree shake.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:48:59
In practice the exchange (traditionally on stock markets the market makers) buy and sell to create liquidity.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:10:54
Where can I see sell orders?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:21
Depends when you got in.
For many HODL is the only option.
Without fail, when I day trade, I lose so I will HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:37
Everyone is concerned.
But it has been a long time coming.
There will be a lot of peaks a troughs.
Lots of people will make money and lots will lose money.
There is a lot to figure out.
Bitcoin and blockchains are now mainstream. 
Those investing may find their bubble burst.
Those holding as insurance as per gold will be fine.
Those using it as cash ... will be disappointed for a while, but hopefully not much longer.
All new techs get adopted at a faster rate than previous. See vhs vs dvd vs blue ray etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:06
Only if you bought before brexit 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:54:10
Dear lord please no. Just HODL.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:38:44
Yes. What do you think a correction is?
The price has dropped by about 1k from the high.

It was a personal transaction to some chap in the uk who proceeded to pay for the pizza in the us.
It wasn’t an enterprising pizza franchise.

What do you look like?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:33:16
Let’s assume we disagree.
And concentrate on why people think they are above the law and want to evade paying tax instead leaving it for other people to pay more.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:54:43

The opposite.
You only pay tax when you sell.

Yeah that’s way better
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:33:43

@_date: 2017-11-30 10:56:14
No. There is nothing to suggest the founders have created bitcoin with anything other than good intent.
Ponzi schemes by their very design are to steal from innocent and naive.
That’s not to say that millions of people won’t lose money on Bitcoin, but not by design.

Coinbase are the real winners with bitcoin.
And they were well aware 40 people were coming for dinner.
Utterly incompetent.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:44:43
Has been slow/down for an hour.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:12:02
To buy today you need a credit card.
To buy with lower fees you need a bank transfer and a week and you hope the price doesn’t go up faster than the card fees would have been.
You keep your coin in the Coinbase wallet overnight.
You hit sell.
You then need to authorise your receiving account by sending a small amount to Coinbase and then you’ll have to wait a week for the funds to arrive.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:25:59
Thanks you just ruined retirement for me

Any time anyone makes money, whether a large amount or a small amount, is required to pay tax on the profits when realised.

Coinbase is (also) a wallet.
Some people will tell you to move to a 3rd party, actually no, a 1st party wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:56
Whatever you do, don’t sell now at a loss. You won’t get back in. You also will be burnt and won’t want back in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:50:48
Did you profit? Then no.
Do you need the cash? Then no.
Can you afford to lose the cash? Then no.
Did you just get spooked? I’m holding. Day trading is too risky.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:51
Coinbase is certainly one option.

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:43:57

This is to do with Coinbase and their abysmal systems and support. I hope the financial regulators fine them big time.

‘“Experts” are jealous they missed out.’
Analysts and Experts are up in arms that the monopoly they inherited now has competition.
They were so self assured that only they were allowed to make money they couldn’t be bothered to look out for disruption to their industry.
One self proclaimed expert insisted that all bitcoins should be given to them to manage to keep the workers safe from spending all of the worlds money.

She’s taking a breather. It’s a good thing.
Please don’t encourage people to sell unless you are certain it is the right thing to do or you are willing to stump up the difference if hat person wants back in at a higher price.
Edit: hmm you may not have suggested sell, you said abandon ship.

Looking at gdax 10k ain’t being hit any time soon.
The sell orders ramp up above 9990.
It would seem someone is dumping at 9955 at the same speed people are buying.

There will be a lot of turbulence.
Lots of private investors will get burnt by the pos taking over.

No one is going to convince you to gamble. If you need convincing then please don’t do it.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t need convincing. You must convince yourself.
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology and as such there is no history to learn from.
There is no such thing as a high reward guaranteed return.

It’s fine, just a breather or correction.
Well actually it’s not fine if you can’t sell when you want to.  But the point is your coins are safe.

No volume on the order books, although the 24 hr volume is higher.
Lots of profit taking. I’m happy for them.
Only these opportunities are so rare you have to ride them. as the next batch of threads won’t be “I wish I bought in xxx or for yyy” it will be “I wish I didn’t sell at 11k”

You’re a fork
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:34
Do you think the forthcoming ii interest with their army of boys will make it better or worse?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:32:52
Good. And inevitable. Bitcoin is entering the mainstream.

A weird hope for a law abiding citizen. Are you a criminal?

I’m not sure a user agreement can ever override finlaws (just made that up), but you’re probably right it may well be user error.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:27:32
They already do?

This shouldn’t be posted. There is no substance here. It’s a disgusting attempt at a pump.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:15
That’s already the case. Presumably that’s why you are here now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:36:45
I am sure there will be a correction.
Might be 20%.
Might correct when the price reaches $15k.
A correction isn’t always what it seems as the current price is less than the corrected price possibility I’ve just described.
