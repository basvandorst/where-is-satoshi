Haha yes everything else is a shitcoin when /OUR/ coin takes 15 minutes to verify and has 50$ fees when it's actually being used

Binance was the main reason it was afloat in the first place, the other exchanges dont really matter for SV. That's how insignificant it was/is.

i didnt read anything you said but you're just one of them new kids who wants btc to be a store of value, go away stupid new kids.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:03:07

Halley = Hal Finney
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:42:57
Why do you keep believing this Bitfinexed guy? It has been proven over and over again he sold all his bitcoins at 1800$ and starting shorting BTC and is now extremely bitter and spreads FUD the moment he can.
On top of that every few weeks he'll start begging for "court lawsuit funds" then never update on it ever again
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:01:47
yall been saying that since it was 20k LMAO
"We need to bleed fast to 17000 so we can bounce boys"
"We gotta bleed to 10000 in order to bounce.."
"5000 is the absolute bottom it wont go up once it hits that" 
fuck off already

he's an absolute no one that probably got lucky with guessing the password to the forum account.
Satoshi was Halley and he died in 2016
