Wrong. She has always been curious about tech and is usually an early adopter. Not when it comes to keeping her money safe though. She's smart like that.

How much of your money could be lost with sending a letter? 
I really want bitcoin to be successful. But until I can be 100% sure that my mother won't lose her money, I find it hard to recommend something to her other than her US bank account. Federally insured. For travel purchases where she would move a little money to a crypto account temporarily? That might be a somewhat safe and useful scenario.
So it's not the complexity of using bitcoin that is the actual problem. It's the complexity of keeping it secure. People get hacked *all the time*. I don't see how you convince those same folks that they can somehow magically do better when it comes to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:09:16


The entire idea of digital currency is seriously challenged by your entire comment. My bank account is insured by the US government for up to $250,000.  Zero worries ever about the bank being robbed, hacked, they invest and lose it or whatever. It's covered. Until BTC *security* is as simple as that, it's going to have a tough time competing when it comes to folks like my Mom. In other words, the vast majority of people.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:13:14
I read the article. It's full of buzzwords that I barely understand and I'm a programmer. My mother and the average Joe would laugh at your article. It means nothing to them. It's like reading an advanced biology paper. And neither can you explain your article. You simply trust it. If you can explain the math behind the crypto, then go for it. We can dig into actual source code if you want and I'll ask you questions about the source code?  
I think this is the correct git repo for the source code? Which file shall we start with?
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:17:07
I already said what I want in my original post all the way at the top of this chain. For *security* to be easy for the average Joe. Right now it is: he puts his money in the bank. Problem solved.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:39:20
What does any of that have to do with ease of security and average Joe knowing his money is definitely safe and he didn't do something stupid like the time he let hackers into the company computers with that thumb drive he found outside the office? Average Joe knows he's not smarter than the hackers. Average Joe is right.
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:57:56
That's a good point. But I feel much more confident explaining foreign currency exchange rates than guaranteeing a relative that their money will definitely be safe, can never be hacked. That's such a... bold claim. And both parties will be unhappy when you are proven wrong.

From YOUR article:  
"People have also found creative ways to cheat. Emin Gün Sirer and his  colleagues at Cornell University have shown that there is a way to  subvert a blockchain even if you have less than half the mining power of  the other miners. The details are somewhat technical, but essentially a  “selfish miner” can gain an unfair advantage by fooling other nodes  into wasting time on already-solved crypto-puzzles."  
Please explain how the average person can avoid the problem described above. What do they need to learn? Or who do they need to trust?  
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:25:55


It's an issue for the bank, not for me. My bank account is federally insured. Every US bank account is. Maximum I can be held liable for with my credit card is $50.


Just like someone I know has lost the password to their Bitcoin.


Sure. I'll just have to wait a few years. In the meantime I can send you thousands of articles about stuff programmers previously declared "impossible to hack" that have been hacked. Let's not forget I am talking about *convincing my older parents or the average Joe on the street* that their money is safe. Or more accurately, that they won't screw up the security themselves and lose their own money. Most of them are wise enough to know it's 100% B.S. Because they've seen technology fail over and over. Especially when it comes to security. Here's just one example. Cars are pretty valuable, eh? Trust us, this new digital key fob is super convenient and can't be hacked.....[
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:00:00
And my point was that security will always be way more difficult than sending an email. Sending an email did not "used to be super hard". It was a few instructions.  Want to see Bitcoin take off? Show me an account that is Federally insured and guaranteed by the US government. Or something similar. Just insured by some Swiss company? Nah. I might have to take them to court to get my money.

Might be as good as it gets. And that's not good. You can't explain and verify the math behind why and how it works. And even if you can (go for it), my mother will not be able to or want to understand it unless it takes less than 3 minutes. Because her bank works fine for her. Here's what she can understand: "Your money at the bank is guarded by people with guns and if someone steals the money the US government guarantees you get it all back, up to $250,000".
My Mom: "Who the fuck is Trezor? What keeps him from going out of business?"
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:13:20
You don't lose your money if you used a credit card and you notice it in time. I can call up my credit card company and cancel any transaction whatsoever, no questions asked. Or perhaps some security questions asked. Which is reassuring.
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:31:11


And I pointed out that it's not ease of use, which the OP seemed focused on. It's *ease of good security* \- something that is much harder than ease of use - which we need when it comes to a digital currency.


Seriously? Google search on the news will give you about 250,000 sources.[
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:39:25
I wasn't being sarcastic. My point was that your guarantee means zero to my Mom. Or to me. Or to anyone. In what way is that point sarcastic or not valid?
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:19:54
I'm not even talking about exchange rate fluctuation. I can make it simpler: most people do not trust themselves to secure something that has to do with computers. The only alternative I can see is that they might trust someone else. So far that someone else has not come along. USD in their bank until something like that happens.
@_date: 2019-02-06 22:31:30


She does know who Apple is. So does everyone on earth. Compare to "some guy named Trezor". She does know her money is FDIC insured up to $250,000 if the bank fails and she also knows the maximum she can lose due to credit card or debit card fraud is $50. And banks return the money from fraudulent transactions and go after the criminals by themselves. Banks offer a hell of a lot more than your average exchange when it comes to security.


Yep. I never said otherwise. I'm predicting one simple thing: that isn't going to happens until BTC security gets as easy to understand as "the bank keeps my money safe using big safes and guns and armored vehicles and huge cyber security teams and if they still mess up, FDIC has me covered. Backed by nothing less than the US government." I am hoping that happens sooner than later. I like BTC. But so far it has not passed "the mom test".
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:46:59
It actually all works out the same. If the bank doesn't fail, then they generally replace your money in most cases. In some cases, like stolen debit card or credit card, they are legally required to replace your money if you report it on time. If they can't replace your money because they ran out of money, then the bank fails and you're covered by FDIC. Yes there are some exceptions. It's still WAY better than what's offered by exchanges.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:04:17


Do you? My bank account deposit is *insured by the US government up to $250,000 no matter what happens to my bank*. Someone can hack the bank, rob it, burn it down, the bank can invest my money in crap investments. Doesn't matter. I'll get my money back. WAY safer than your safe deposit box which can in fact burn. Your box which is *still guarded by the very same people guarding my money*.


So the US government is what you're relying on? Same as me with my deposit insurance *up to $250,000*. You're just not making a convincing case for BTC security being easy. In fact you're making things sounds worse.
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:17:31


Thanks for the guarantee. I told my Mom that guarantees it's safe. She still says "nah, I'll keep my cash in the bank where it's safe".
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:46:36


That's not a problem with my bank. I just show them ID and I get a new set of keys.


That's why we keep it in a bank.


Except for all the stories about when it has been hacked. The idea that some sort of technology cannot be hacked is laughable. Ask anyone involved in cyber security.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:21:20


I'll have way bigger problems than currency when that happens. If I'm worried about that, I should by buying guns and gold, not BTC. And your safe deposit box is somehow safe when FDIC collapses? lol
Also kind of cute that you think Trezor, a private company has less risk of collapsing than FDIC. We are getting into absurd scenarios the average person would just laugh at. And my original post was about **the average person**. So have the last word if you must. I'm done.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:49:45


What is a bit? What is a bitcoin key? Do I get a copy of that like my car key? I've heard that computers are bad at random numbers. Casino machines in Las Vegas are getting robbed blind by hackers due to random numbers that are not really random. Can you prove to me that won't happen with my bitcoin? How long is this going to take to explain? Because my bank account already works just fine..................


And we are back full circle. My prediction was simply that average Joe won't choose to use it any time soon **because for some crazy reason people get a little extra fussy when it comes to protecting their money**. Let me know when that changes and BTC is being used more than USD and US banks. I'll wait.
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:08:51
Bitcoin might be as easy. I already agreed to that. Will Bitcoin *security* be as easy? Email is easy to use. It's also used to trick and even rob people all the time.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:27:34


The bank already has my business and everyone's business. They don't need to convince me. But I actually don't care. Because my bank account is insured by the US government for up to $250,000. No matter what happens to the bank. And if a bunch of banks fail, it's everyone's problem because we all use banks. So we'll figure a way to fix it. If BTC fails now, only a few people care. In fact, people have lost huge amounts of BTC due to corruption or just incompetence. And no one cares. The BTC is gone.  
From my very original post:  
"So it's not the complexity of using bitcoin that is the actual problem.  It's the complexity of keeping it secure. People get hacked *all the time*. I don't see how you convince those same folks that they can somehow magically do better when it comes to bitcoin."  
The banks don't have to do any convincing. It's the Bitcoin community that needs to somehow convince the average Joe.

My mother would laugh at nonsense like this. It might even have some truth to it. But the average American is watching Fox News or CNN for a 10 second sound bite about what Bitcoin is. The average person imagines a tin-foil hat on top of your head and keeps their money at their bank. So no, your argument isn't going to make anyone adopt Bitcoin any quicker.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:29:03
Please refer to my original post. You need to convince the average Joe that the above is not a concern. He's not going to just take your word that his money is safe. Why would he? He's supposed to trust "the open source nature of Bitcoin"? Are you joking?
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:34:23


What is a seed? How does a seed keep my money safer than the guards at the bank?


I've done cryptography programming. It's been a while but I'm sure I could understand anything I'd want about how HW wallets work. I'm also positive you can't give me the mathematical proof a Trezor can't be hacked. You just trust what someone said. And what I'm damn sure of beyond everything is that you have zero chance of convincing the average Joe that something called a seed is safer than his bank.  You've done a horrible job so far.
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:06:22
In the 1980s I implemented the [Data Encryption Standard]( in C (or was it machine code?) so we could use it on AS/400 computers where the DES was not available until my code. This DES was later proven to be insecure by people smarter than me, but I'll be happy to explain the DES in detail and how the code behind it works. It's mostly bitwise operations. What's your crypto background? :-D
@_date: 2019-02-08 15:29:56


Yes. We are going around in circles here. The point is that people trust banks with their money *in savings or checking accounts* because banks have a pretty reliable history. The combination of FDIC, 3rd party insurance, and banks spending a lot on both physical and cyber security is way beyond what Bitcoin offers at the moment for the same amount of effort.

She's an early adopter. She used to have a full time job in tech. As she has gotten older some stuff does seem more confusing to her. Not her bank. That's super simple. Seeds? Cold storage? Some guy named Trezor? Give me one reason she should trust any of that when ***her bank has worked great to keep her money safe for 70 years***?
I'm a programmer. I've been a programmer for decades.
I cannot explain fully what a seed is and the math behind it. Can you? Or do you just trust what the programmers say? Can you give me the mathematical proof behind the cryptography? I've done crypto programming. Happy to get into the details. Or just admit that you simply trust a bunch of people without really knowing if you should trust them.
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:43:37


No she didn't. It took me 1 minute to show her how email works. She never asked any more questions. Same for a cellphone. She bought one and started using it. She never asked me how to use it. Same for Facebook. However she *has* called me many times about security. And I don't always have a great answer. She has made security mistakes with posting personal info because she isn't always sure if a post on Facebook is public or just for friends. She has asked me about suspicious emails. Ease of use of *security* is not an easy nut to crack. We have been trying at it since computers were invented and things are getting worse, not better. She will stick with the bank thank you very much.

Where would a safe deposit box be located? In a bank perhaps? Same place she trusts to keep her cash safe?
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:17:31
Let's go back to my original post. It's about the complexity of keeping things secure *according to my mother*. The mother test is a great way to evaluate new tech. And as far as my mother is concerned, your cold storage, hardware can fail, have to make a backup, can't lose the password, better be a password no one can guess, etc. is a *lot* more complex than her bank. Which is also Federally insured.
The article I posted is relevant. People can and do lose passwords.

No it isn't. She already has a bank account. Like everyone else.














Seeds? Math equations? Block chains? Electrum?
My mother understands money guarded by guns. And insured by the US government. Unless she can easily understand the math behind all of the above, then it just amounts to her taking your word that all of the above is true. Why should she trust you or anyone else that the above is true? And what happens when Trezor goes out of business and she can't get a replacement? I have old backup tapes that I can't get stuff off of. The hardware to read the tapes isn't sold anymore... 


Same place she trusts to keep her cash safe? Ha! I'm afraid you're going to have to do a little bit better than that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:34:33
I get what you are saying. But right now I have a very easy way of replacing fiat I use. Go to work tomorrow. Is there a way of replacing bitcoin other than buying it with fiat? Let's say I earn in dollars but have an account in Euros too. If I make a large purchase in Euros I will buy more Euros to keep the minimum amount of Euros I want in my Euro account. It doesn't mean anything about which currency I prefer to spend. In fact in the case I described it was clearly more convenient at that moment to buy the product using Euros. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:12:41


Source? Someone has done a survey of businesses pricing things in BTC?


Do you have evidence this is happening? Because if I could find someone to pay me in BTC, I would keep the BTC. Your entire argument collapses if there are any businesses keeping BTC for services rendered. By your own definition, that's a currency.
I'm going to stop here. I'm confident I've done a good job at proving my claim. I'll leave the last word to you.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:08:40
Anyone who works for a living does immediately replace their fiat. They exchange their time, labor or some other service of value for more fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:29:35
Thanks for the answers. If you don't mind, could you explain why you are using bitcoin in the first place? Why not just use USD?
Also, could you give some more detail about what the process is? Since merchants don't accept bitcoin, what do you do? Cash out some bitcoin for local currency and then use that to buy goods? How does all this happen? An in-depth step by step story would be awesome if you have time.
How many people are doing what you are doing? Is BTC used widely there?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:54:47
You've got a lot wrong there. First, I try to have more fiat every month of my life. I continue to earn and save fiat and spend far less than I earn. While I might not need to instantly replace what I spend, that's only because I saved it in the first place.
I buy Euros, bitcoin, Reals, the Pound, Hk dollars and several other currencies that I use regularly. If I can occasionally earn in any of those currencies then I do. So far no one has offered to pay me in bitcoin or HK dollars. That doesn't make them any less of a currency.
And some people do get paid in bitcoin. Some retailers come to mind. What happens when they spend that bitcoin they earned? Aren't they using it as a currency?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:32:29


Well actually yes I do. If I spend in a currency I don't earn money in then I try to rebuy that currency as soon as I can. There is a certain amount of British pounds I want in my UK savings account. So if I spend in pounds I will rebuy the same amount of pounds I just spent.


That's not why I buy GBP and other currencies. There are many reasons, but I use GBP often enough that I want some savings. So when I earn in dollars, spend in GBP, and then replace the GBP by buying them with dollars what do you call that?
I can do the same with Bitcoin.  I think the point that you are missing is that Bitcoin can be both an investment *and* a currency.


If you want your investment to do well, doesn't it make sense to use and promote the product?


You have a point here if and only if you could buy the product in the same currency as you earn. But if I look at it like my GBP account, I replace the currency I spend as quickly as possible because I know I will spend the GBP again in the future, and I'm expecting the GBP to go up in value. Same as Bitcoin. The only problem with Bitcoin at the moment is that not enough businesses accept it. How might that change? I know for sure it's not going to change if businesses offer the option and no one uses it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:11:02


That's a huge assumption.
What if the person you just gave BTC values it more than fiat? You've been claiming that as your main premise this entire time, yet for some reason the person you just gave BTC values fiat more than BTC? I guess that could be the case sometimes, but for a business at this stage to be accepting BTC I would have to guess they value BTC. In which case they are getting a great deal. They can avoid the fees of converting from fiat into BTC.
In which case you can't take away the 3rd party.


Sure you can. My USD balance is always going up, month after month. I earn more than I spend. But I spend a lot too. I see no reason the same thing can't happen for my BTC account.


It seems like by accepting it at their place of business they are valuing it as a currency. And by replacing BTC that I spend so that I can spend even more BTC in the future, I also value it as a customer. If I didn't replace the BTC by buying more with fiat, then my BTC balance would eventually be zero, wouldn't it be? How do I spend BTC when my balance is zero?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:49:29
Already asked elsewhere, but what can you spend it on? I'll add to that question by asking how prices are determined? Are prices for goods in bitcoin somewhat stable or do they fluctuate a lot? One would imagine that the price of goods varies a lot based on the bitcoin to USD price or some other exchange rate.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:29:49


It's priced in both.


Every company that does business in more than one currency "obsesses" over currency prices relative to each other.


Usually. If I can trade my labor for GBP or Euros I'll do that too. Saves me exchange fees and wire fees. And I'd accept payment in BTC too. But no one is offering that so far, so my only choice if I want to use BTC as a currency is to earn in one currency and then use that currency to buy BTC. Same as if when I can't earn in Euros. I buy Euros with USD or GBP.
You never answered my question about how I can spend BTC if I let my balance get down to zero. If I want to use it as a currency, what other option do I have but to buy it? Same as I do when I want to use HK dollars as a currency. If my HK dollars get down to zero and I still want to spend, I buy more HK dollars. How is that currency different from the way I treat BTC?


Same as a business that earns BTC by selling goods? I think you've just proven my point for me. BTC is a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:01:00
For me it's the opposite. When I can easily explain to my mother how to keep her bitcoin safe and use it to buy a coffee is when it will explode as a currency. That's when to invest big time and what I'm keeping my eye out for. And I do believe it will eventually happen due to competition between cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:42:15
How are they gambling with your money? Your account (in the US at least) is FDIC insured. There is zero risk to you. Meanwhile folks have actually lost bitcoin due to shady exchanges. I'm no fan of big banks, but credit unions are pretty cool, and no gamble involved.
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:43:21
My guess is that they have ways of detecting fraud with this question. Just like when they seem to get your address wrong or something and you correct them. You're assuming it's them throwing their weight around but that's probably your own bias against authority because there are other reasonable explanations for why they would do that and you've settled on the motivation that bothers you and without any evidence.

Yeah and they don't care about the reason actually if you test them on it. When they ask me for a reason I always say I want to buy stuff but I'm not sure what. Never had a problem.
