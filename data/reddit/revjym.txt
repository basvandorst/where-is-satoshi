It gives you a better guess. If reading charts was an exact science every person who step foot on Wall Street in the last 100+ years would be a multi millionaire. But they aren’t. Why’s that? They read charts for a living,

Go for as many as you can responsibly invest in. Not an arbitrary number created by a meme.

This phrase is old as dirt, but somehow lost on the crypto community:
“Past performances is no guarantee of future results”

“According to current depreciation rates, the value of a new vehicle can drop by more than 20 percent after the first 12 months of ownership. Then, for the next four years, you can expect your car to lose roughly 10 percent of its value annually. This means that a new car can be worth as little as 40 percent of its original purchase price after five years.”  -Carfax

Just because something is for the greater good of society doesn’t mean it will succeed.
If that was the case cigarettes would be illegal since they kill hundreds of thousands of people a year.
If bitcoin flourishes in the future it won’t be at the expense of the people who run this world but because of.

Just because something is good for society doesn’t mean it will succeed. That’s not how the real world works.
