It's known to be the best source of news on the internet. It's a New York Times x10, they go so far on their investigations it's crazy. 
It's also a very good read! Check it out!

I was part of your "internal group" AKA facebook group filled with kids that are brought in by Adar, but I noticed it's all a scam man. The last I heard is you failed to send a girl an ipod you claimed you did. You send tshirts to everyone to keep them quiet. I left after working hard but not getting anywhere because you don't know how to handle a company. You would make people kill a competitor, which just that is sad.

It is most likely not Circles fault, it has to do with the government policies.

No, it's a tip with a personalized message, and he put the name as "$10.001.00" but one can always wish
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:39:57
Lol wut? The format on this tip is awesome! I give you credit for this :) Very original! Haha one day I'll have enough to give out personalized tips! Not OP but just some random friendly stranger stopping to say hi haha!

I was part of the private fb group they have and I saw that kid a lot so I can confirm he "works" for them. Either way that fb group only got worse and worse. I bet it must be the most hateful group ever.

@_date: 2014-06-02 23:40:59
Wow nice tip! Like OP said, bitcoin tips as SO rare, this makes you an awesome person! :)

You made my day with that comment. I laughed for a good five minutes.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:04:04
OP I support you completely, I was also part of their "internal group" which is a circlejerk of kids on a fb group.

This is a great idea! It will spread the word out in a better way!

I can see why the downvotes, but to answer your question seriously: it is impossible. 
Every day thousands, if not millions, of credit cards are stolen. Just recently Home Depot got hacked and millions of costumer information were stolen.
Not only that, the rings of selling/buying stolen credit cards are generally done in the deep web (i.e: tor), so to get "access" to those rings it takes a lot of contacts. In other words, you have to be in the game a long time.
Third point, you would need billions of dollars, literally. I've read each credit card is valued around $5-10 in the black market (rough estimate), so multiply that by millions and keep adding millions over the years. 
Many more reasons too.
Yep..you will get downvoted to oblivion, sorry buddy. Hope I helped :)
tl;dr: not "the logical choice"
edit: wrong word

Who cares? They're all crows anyways.

Of course, though it must have been quite a challenge, therefore that is were my question lies.

This is a very good idea, mainly to create an algorithm that manages to complete that task flawlessly.

Bitcoin has grown to the point were it acts more like the stock market. Some people are still thinking in the puppy age of Bitcoin.
Thank you for your insight! I can only hope everyone reads this and understands it.
