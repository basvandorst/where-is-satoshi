Isnt that a sunk cost fallacy? The users invested xxx in an idea with representative computations that they valued at some amount of xxx. The future value of that has nothing to do with anyone. In short, it was you guys gamble and no one owes you anything.

You are so cute! Know this, the first day that there is no oversight I will come for you. Oh yes, I will. I will strip you of your weapons and send you to tend my garden. You will call me lord and I will take your woman. Your children will work beside you and You will all come to love me because I keep you safe. But you will work very hard and get very little in return.
A neighboring lord may come for me someday and kill me. You will love him even more and work hard for him, because he has improved your lot in life. He is a HERO and you will name him king.
Welcome back to feudalism, idiot.

I am not too familiar with the semiconductor business but i would think that there are different avenues to acquiring hash power. A concerted effort by investors or semiconductor manufacturers could easily take the majority of hash power for themselves. I am just wondering how feasible it would be.

Could you explain that a bit?

So your estimate is based on bulk orders from existing manufacturers. I wonder what it would take to have one of the big guys dedicate to R and D....

Not really, sorry. I thought the bitcoins could be moved around in and out of addresses with other coins and thus be harder or impossible to trace.
@_date: 2014-08-04 22:47:49
Hmmm that's a good idea.... what is preventing such transparency now? Surely the government isn't sending cash.

I didn't downvote you but my opinion is this:
The banking scare and demonization of the fed has blown over. The conspiracy theory youtube video's that were the flavor of the day during the financial crisis have been examined and debunked by now, it turns out actually that the FED is a good thing. The FED is the culmination of prior financial crises and is the safety net that has set western economies head and shoulders above any other because our money is soooo stable.  
We were on the cusp of starving in the streets and anarchy but it never happened because the FED kept everything stable with it's policy. The fallout could have and has been much worse. 
The problem is not the fed, it is the flaws in capitalism. Too much money is involved in politics and bitcoin will do nothing but exacerbate that.

Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:47:21
You are right that was a broad unsupported claim.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:51:38
That makes sense. Am I correct in assuming there is a correlation between the value of bitcoin and the money that has been spent mining them?
As the difficulty increases will mining (and the fees/transaction confirmations)  move into the control of those with enough capital to mine competitively? We already have seen the requirements to mine move quickly beyond the reach of casuals. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:59:35
What are you gonna do when the real capitalists show up? The type of people who will gladly start a war or destabilize a country, on purpose, for profit? You are attempting to build a currency that is used worldwide, you will attract the attention of the richest, coldest, greediest people on the planet. There is no morality involved on this level bud.

My thought is that with 51 percent hash power an institution could be the de facto "bitcoin bank" and have the power to validate or invalidate transactions as they see fit.

I think you are gonna get hammered by the neo cons around here. Many of these guys are looking to undermine governments and see bitcoin as their magic sword to bring in a cleaner capitalism. I am of the opinion that it will fail but I do see a dystopian future should they succeed.  
  
If we had a democratic input and some regulation on bitcoin I guess it could be great but that's not the popular opinion.

Fact about humans: if there is an advantage to be gained SOMEONE will exploit it. Sure YOU might have some type of morality but YSK that there are plenty of people who have no qualms watching the world burn for profit.
This stuff has to be rock solid to work. If it is possible to exploit, it is garbage, period.

Who is "we"? Isn't it just a mathematical solution based on prior transactions? The math is either correct or not and the proof is the solution. How could there be a denial of the solution? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:21:23
You are right about a lot of things. Bitcoin is way too complex for the masses and the libertarians who see bitcoin as a way to undermine the government are incredibly naive.
There will always be a government and we should be happy that we have the one where we have some small say in how it is run. A move to pure capitalism would make us all serfs. The country would be run by true capitalists and their mercenary companies. How innocent  and coddled they are to believe otherwise.
Bitcoin is good for buying pot and that is about it. You are all being scammed by people who are smarter than you.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:48:07
How could you not get away with it? Is there legal recourse to recovering the coins?
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:06:45
I am curious as to what you guys are trying to achieve by all this analysis of "the missing coins." Isn't the point of bitcoins that they can be tumbled and made anonymous? What do you intend/hope if tomorrow you had decisive evidence that it was x person who stole the bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:02:23
Can you tell me why you come up with this number? Is that construction of a fabrication facility or contracting huge orders from existing chip makers?

I see bitcoin as dangerous and untenable. Unregulated financial sector will allow the true capitalists, that is, the owners and money manipulaters, to rise unchecked into a plutocracy. The peoples and groups who's wealth has ascended beyond numbers to the power to leverage buyouts and accrue interest on a scale that allows no use for the money but to acquire more capital. Those groups will likely invest and support bitcoin for these reasons.
Apart from the dystopian future of bitcoin I think it did have use as an underground currency for silkroad and untracable transfers, but it has evolved to a ponzi scheme used to divest the believers and speculators from their fiat. It is just too complicated and dangerous to replace government backed currency. The reason the u.s. economy is so successful is because of the stable and safe dollar. No one wants to have to worry about losing the magic key to their retirement money. The bitcoin "banks" robbing their clients with no recourse for the people. That is the advantage of fiat and fdic. These people are crazy.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:58:34
I asked a question. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:03:49
So when you guys lose the 7 billion dollars you have thrown at bitcoin you are gonna try again?

Thank you for your reply. I just went to an atm and got hammered though.

Violence is nowhere near the only nor even the best way to control peoples lives. Predatory lending, monopoly, false advertisement, pure propaganda. So many ways. By the time you institute a libertarian state and take care of all the inequity you have probably surpassed where we are now. Pure foolishness.
I don't think libertarians understand the social contract and how flimsy it actually is. Reality does not always match ideology and what one thinks is fair is not what everyone does.

How do you guys intend to address the problems that come with unregulated capitalism? Wildly fluctuating interest rates? Company towns? The great depression? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:55:05
So is that the consensus in this sub? Anarcho capitalist? Bitcoin is interesting to me as a medium of exchange but the political motivations seem insane to me...
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:18:01
I would think free markets lead to monopolies...
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:03:41
I see how the interest rates can work. The company town is in reference to capitalists having control of a means of production and using the profits to acquire more of the means. The barrier of entry will  be too high for anyone who sells their labor on the labor market to ever buy into the means.
Capital grows naturally through interest, while the value of labor seems static or even falls. Monopoly is inevitable in a free market. Theses are some of the thoughts I had hoped to have addressed with my question.

This is what I have been seeing around here. Many of the posts have become political rants by extreme anarcho-capitalists who seem to believe bitcoin is the tool that is going to bring down the evil governments control of the money. They conflate bitcoin with their political agenda and get all worked up and defensive.
Bitcoin is an interesting idea by itself and should be examined as such.
@_date: 2013-07-15 02:11:51
Can you cite how the government "creates business cycles?"
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:37:49
Basically economies of scale raise the barrier of entry to a point where it is impossible for new sellers to enter the market.
Take the grocer as an example, originally all grocery stores were somewhat equal, then some few were able to take a larger market share. Safeway and lucky or whatever is local and familiar to you rose up on economy of scale. They are able to purchase in bulk and ship in bulk, management is pared down to an incredibly efficient level and you get monopolistic competition. Some few companies sharing the same market.
The barrier to entry is high because a new company must be able to compete pricewise to obtain market share but they cannot because they lack the economies of scale. The market now has very few companies and some will die out due to poor business choices or whatever. 
Enter walmart, amazing business model with huge economies of scale. The ability to price out competition by selling at a loss until they control the market. 
There are many examples of monopoly being checked by the government. Telecommunications, airlines, banks etc.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:23:01
I cannot believe how condescending you are. It was an honest question that received not one answer.You guys are a bunch of whacko's. No plan right? Just let the market decide? Haha that is fucking hilarious. You will soon find that human concerns have very little value in your blessed market. Idiots.
@_date: 2013-08-25 04:19:32
How does that even make sense? Bitcoin is a form of money, it is also a fiat currency in that it has no intrinsic value. The other option is barter and that is when your currency has some value.
"Government" is not the problem. The monied elite and the natural gravity of money brought about by usury is the problem. If anything the people need to rein in the banking and money system. More oversight is the answer.
