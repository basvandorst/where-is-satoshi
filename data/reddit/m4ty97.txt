That's a good point. I keep hearing "BTC is limited so price can only go up" but in reality, it's not true. If selling pressure increases, price will dump and it won't matter how rare BTC is and how close to the next halving we are. If that were a true, premined shitcoins would always go up (because they have smaller inflation than BTC). Think of it like about old phones, which aren't created anymore - does it mean, their price will only rise just because of that?

2% of weekly amplitude... amazing taking into account what happened in last months

If smallers sums like let's say 1, 4 or 10 BTC were in game, perhaps it could be possible to get them back by making the case public on reddit. 1200 BTC is shit ton of money and I doubt they were blocked by case or some mistake. If law enforcement is really in then calling reddit won't help. Get a lawyer.

Market doesn't sleep and even if it goes sideways, there is plenty of money to be earned (or lost). 70-80% of volume is done by bots who market make, trade micro moves, do arbitrage and so on. Some of these bots are run by whales which trade millions of dollars just in one move.
If You're daytrader with $10000-$100000 then doing even $1000000 volume daily is not a huge deal. Now imagine there are thousands (if not tens of thousands) of people who do it each day.


They do it against themselves and it's just enough to create a huge volume.

I don’t know how many daytraders there are, but if You’re scalping or trading micro moves then higher volumes come up very quickly. And regarding to wash trading, even if You do so, You still need to pay fees which at higher volumes may be a lot of money. From what I’ve noticed, binance and okex volume look kinda suspicious (most likely a lot of wash trading) but on exchanges such as coinbase, bitfinex or bitstamp it looks pretty legit and I don’t think most of their’s volume comes from wash trading.
