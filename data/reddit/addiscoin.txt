Sure that's going really well. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:24:12
lots of volume for that assumption, lol 
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:03:25
Ignore stupidx, (s)he is a confirmed ticker symbol troll.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:11:27


You speak for the community? I am concerned.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:38:34
Have you seen the BTC mempool? That is why 8mb. And higher in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:06:17
Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:39:59
Or perhaps it's your understanding that is off.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:31:34
How can you consider Bitcoin "poised for launch" when the fees are as high as they are. If we even began a moon exploration now, the mempool would overflow.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:47:04
I can't say, i'm afraid to post about that. I don't want to get banned since responding about that topic is against this sub's rules.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:20:16
I agree. Cash on bithumb and Core on bitfinex, the volumes are fake. And yes, we see nodes spun up by the same individuals on amazon a lot on both sides as well.. Nevertheless, I think it's still interesting to watch.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:58:46
It's a protocol upgrade to increase capacity.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:57:35
Hmmm. Down 10% today. Very bullish  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:35:33
Last year.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:06:40
I'm a user and I want the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:16:30
Mempool isn't ready for that.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:26
Of course.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:36:40
How do you expect to reach consensus if its not about what the users want?
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:20:51
20k is not a couple hundred bucks.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:51:18
Oh no! That sounds really scary. Good reason to be frightened by him. /s
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:24:52
I want some of what you are smoking.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:09:15
They propose a scaling solution at a time like this and you call it spam?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:10
just ended...
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:19:58
Also expect FUD from the BIP148 hat folks.
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:36:26
Luke often forgets BTC is a global currency.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:18:40
Core is already going to be displaced.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:09:30
BIP-148 is the planned attack... Our defenses* are prepared.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:02:16
Changelly = Minergate = Scam
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:58:59


Bigger blocks. This would allow more throughput and less fees.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:34:57
You are correct. I have absolutely nothing to be concerned about. BIP-148 will likely turn out to be just a bunch of people turning their nodes off (by rejecting all blocks).
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:24:57
My reference to defenses is the 99%+ hashpower behind the non BIP-148 chain.
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:48:56
However we get rid of them works for me.

FIFY: He is fresh and he is not right you know.

ok redditor for 1 week
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:55:29
80%+ of the network is not SegWit ready, more like 31% currently-  Stop spreading BS.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:39:03
So where does your 80%+ figure come from? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:53:56
Please provide your consensus data on Segwit. Claiming there is consensus on Segwit is a blatant lie.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:47:02


GDAX is still up, trading not effected.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:36:15
Sorry, I guess I am still arguing against the OPs statement that there is consensus on Segwit. You are correct, Core nodes are SegWit ready and there are 80%+ at the moment. However, there is NOT a consensus on the protocol upgrade of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:39:12
Yes, I understand that 80%+ of the current nodes run Core. But how does this relate to the consensus of the community for SegWit? By your logic, if I run a particular client node software, I am suddenly a SegWit supporter. I have a Core node and I do not support SegWit.
