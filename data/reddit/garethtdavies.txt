I wrote about Bitcoin's all time low volatility here

SJCT is just the test token and has no value. SJCX is the tradeable token.

Zapps has already been "claimed" for zero-knowledge dapps ;)

You are missing some exchanges see  albeit QuadrigaCX still has a dominant position.
There is also Einstein exchange in Vancouver  albeit they don't have a CAD order book.

You may see realized (historical) volatility here (based off CAD prices) but it's touching record lows 
The current low volatility mark (23.43
%) was achieved on 16th January 2013.
It would be interesting to see the current number of S&amp;P500 stocks that have a higher realised volatility than Bitcoin currently.

Sorry but that doesn't make sense. They are not providing liquidity, which is what you are implying. They should be holding all the Bitcoin that people have exchanged for fiat and have a 100% full reserve (which many users are now asking for verification of).
Of course, trading volumes did surge over the weekend so it is very plausible their hot wallet ran out - and indeed you could argue that's indicative of a very sensible security policy. The issue here is timing, i.e. why is it taking so long to move funds from cold storage?

This seems a little far-fetched. Using actual trade data from  this is the trading history from Cavirtex
There's no massive spike in volume around the lows.

Whilst I agree that BTCUSD is on the way up I think his definition of stability is interesting. The rouble has a realized volatility over the last 30 days that is 50% lower than the realized volatility in Bitcoin. The rouble is said to be capitulating whereas Bitcoin is apparently stable!

We just hit an all time high market-cap of $13.6bn CAD

The Canadian Bitcoin Index hit a 52-week high of $705.93  
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:23:40
All time market-cap high for Canadian Dollar

Are those live prices or converted as current bids/asks are not at that level.

Ah got you, yes it's a volume weighted Index from all trades denominated in CAD. Kraken also traded at $404 yesterday so the Index gets rid of a lot of the noise of these anomalies.

What if the fee dynamic is actually complex (think queuing systems) and this has nothing to do with "spam" and a stable fee market will never exist?

The transcript is supposed to be public! It was “lost” hence trying to recover it. As it turned out this was a cover story to remove the transcript due to the bug in Sprout see

These are simply ridiculous overgeneralizations.

I think the rally is more a relief rally on the avoidance of the UASF chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:10:46
But there was that Twitter poll... /s
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:01:23
Current global hashrate is 6,177,071,443 GH/s
Slush BIP148 mining is 15PH/s or 15,000,000 GH/s so 0.24%.
Whether that is "significant" is open for interpretation.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:49:35
Did you read the post above "Over 98% of miners putting "NYA" in their blocks."
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:23:15
Well I suppose they could mean "Coinbase certainly overspends on fees" ;) 
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:43:41
This sounds great. There is a WebSocket for Canadian pricing information here incorporating all Canadian exchanges: 
Let me know if there is something specific you need as if buying from Canadian exchanges would be nice to see the CAD price.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:08:27
That is a really bizarre analogy. Who exactly is serving $100 Happy Meals in that case?
There was an overwhelming consensus amongst miners to do Segwit and a reasonable 2MB hardfork as a compromise. This agreement is now being enforced. Segwit itself had a 95% activation threshold that was always considered overwhelming consensus - given this agreement has similar levels of support why should this be any different?
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:05:53
Thanks, corrected
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:54:26
I've never understood this argument as why wouldn't we need bigger blocks with Lightning? They still need a transaction to open and close the channel.
Is there any reason to think that any of the miners would back out of the segwit2x agreement? Assuming they'll have over 80% of the hashrate the minority chain would be crippled.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:41:18
Plus the fees to open and close the LN channel right?
