Their open source gaming platform that’s launching soon and will use the Tron token doesn’t seem like a use? They’re adding more partners and expanding into other forms of content too that will all use the Tron token. If you still don’t see what’s going on here then you’re lost.

Ohhhhhh i see what you’re saying. Honestly a lot of alts exist to solve problems that current currencies like bitcoin are having. (Due to scale) once they’re solved there won’t be a need for them. Iota calls itself an “exchange of resources” um okay I could just pay someone 2 BTC for electricity. The barter system of trading things doesn’t even happen in real life. So while I agree with you there it doesn’t apply to ETH. Honestly, it applies to litecoin more than anything. Litecoin is a coin for payments that once lightning comes won’t even be necessary.

Asia because they’re the most populated region on the planet/most tech savvy 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:25:10
It’s not even “better” it’s literally just a clone aka a shitcoin. Litecoin will be defunct very soon.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:24:35
Once lightning network comes litecoin will be useless lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:40:20
That’s why I stay investing in alts with good roadmaps that are doing very unique things (despite FUD) it’ll work out in 5 years I think ;)
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:27:12
Lol this is what not having knowledge is like huh? Better invest in ETH soon litecoin is going to tank.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:35:53
Here’s the official release on it:  he also stated the integration with peiwo app is almost done. What people don’t seem to realize on here that constantly spread FUD is that this will instantly add 200 million + users to Tron. It’ll be one of the most widely used tokens in the world. Only 4 months after creation. Idk why you choose to spread FUD when you’ve clearly done zero research.

True, but competitors will always exist. I’m just wondering what the catalyst will be for someone to choose one crypto over the other if they’re very similar. The market is very weird and this correction was much needed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:06:07
Then you have almost zero understanding of the crypto market as that’s not true at all. ETH spiked because BTC has transaction times that are way too high. Everyone converted to ETH to move it to different exchanges/to buy alts, and since ETH is the ultimate coin pair to trade with/most alts are built off it it spiked. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:25:50
Yes, it’s value is its utilization and right now that’s exactly what it’s being used for. It never tries to say it’s a currency. It’s a blockchain computing platform. Honestly go read the wiki ethereum is as equally revolutionary as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:20:44
I mean yeah you just described the market but I don’t see anyone cutting into ETH’s market for a while. They’re too well established and alts are still using it. Combined with relatively fast transactions i don’t see bitcoin competing in that space. So right now it’s just straight up ETH (notice how it’s barely dipped.) it’s not new comers speculating, if it were that litecoin would be way up. ETH is up because in terms of utility and usefulness it’s VERY good.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:45:13
That was everyone coming over from just being dickheads. Im so happy bitcoin crashednif that’s what it took to get rid of that bitconnect scam. Would have been way worse for crypto in the long run if they stuck around
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:26:23
Salt from what? LTC is way down &amp; it’s useless once bitcoin adopts what it does. In plain terms it’s a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:20:23
Wait for the next crash that’s coming. That’s how I feel about it. 1.5 trillion a year to the national debt with that bill... there will be soooo much blood on the streets.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:19:32
Lack of talent my ass. You don’t know what you’re talking about, they’re hiring devs from alibaba and Tencent all the time. Not only that they have a ten year roadmap and have only been around for 4 months. They’re also launching their open source gaming platform soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:40:41
Also makes litecoin redundant as well.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:26:30
Crypto kitties market crashed ages ago. ETH is up because of its utility. Litecoin doesn’t have any besides being a “payment” coin. Pretty soon there won’t be a use for that.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:56:00
Lol or you could see it as the ten year project it is and the early work they’ve done is impressive as well. I’m realistic about price, i don’t scream lambo. I just see that it does have potential to grow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:34:27
Sad seeing this now that bitconnect closed down :/
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:24:15
Litecoin is becoming defunct as the times change. It’s pointless.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:22:14
They’re launching their open source gaming platform soon &amp; it will use the Tron token for game currency. If you don’t see the applications there then you don’t understand. They’re going to take over that space because they don’t really have competitors. I think it’s brilliant.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:15:25
Okay no bamboozles though
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:06:51
I hope you’re right. But you’d be a fool not to think that would lead to a recession. Our debt is insane and we aren’t prepared. I mean, it’s very realistic that if policy doesn’t change we could be fucked.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:07:49
No. ETH is being used as a pair for alts on most major exchanges. When eth got too expensive you saw the opposite happen and then people bought bitcoin to trade for alts, but since bitcoin is “shit” and transaction times are too long it went back to eth. It has nothing to do with what you’re talking about. If bitcoin didn’t have its major flaws right now it would have spiked as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:28:27
You’ll be lucky if it ever sees 280 again tbh
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:39:50
I speak from experience cause I hear you. There’s a moment where I just realized that shit accumulates man. I kicked a $50 (7g) weed/week habit recently. $200 a month $1000 after 5 months. $2400 a year for 5 years. $12,000... id id invested that in btc from the moment I learned about it in 2011? Hold me son. Just hold me. (Even if I had that in the bank. Fuck.)

You’re being ignorant to the possible strides technology might make and how our society will shift. Btc could very well work out all I’m saying is that to have complete certainty a better alternative couldn’t come is being short sighted. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:46:12
You forget that all it takes is a better and more reliable/faster crypto to rise. I agree crypto is the future but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be btc

Where did I say I was speaking for myself? Good lord... you do realize most bitcoins are lost? That’s why I used that example. I bet you’re really fun to be around condescending and very full of himself. Good day.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:25:04
People are insane if they actually think that. Guess what? Unless you were here Day 1 you’re not going to get rich enough to get a lambo buying today unless you buy 100k worth and Btc then goes to 100k which would give you 1 million dollars. But that’s it. 1 Mill. Too many idiots putting in &gt; $100 and thinking they’ll get a lambo. MATH YOU FOOLS. MATH.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:41
That is patently false, all it takes is for an exploit or weakness of bitcoin to be found. Anything that could shock bitcoin and make it lose value fast. Anything could happen, you can’t ignore that possibility 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:18:54
Be helpful not an asshole 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:25:09
Nothing! It’s actually awesome! But I’m not talking about a “reasonable” expectation person like you. Some people really think if they put 100 in they’ll wake up to a crazy amount one day just randomly as if this didn’t rely on an exponential relationship.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:23:01
Come one man.... -____- whose to say he wouldn’t hodl 80% of it? He obviously knows it’ll go up. Btw 43 bitcoins back then was like less than $4.... so don’t talk about “valuing” I’ve given 4 homeless people $1 this year and haven’t missed it. No one thought this day would come where it’d be 10k a coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:49:42
Don’t bother with him he will never understand. Even if you told the guy that one day there may not be a fiat currency and bitcoin could have mass adoption he still wouldn’t understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:54:15
Lol you’ve been reading way too many internet comments that just repeat the same bullshit. I bought $200 btc @ $3590 a coin. That was $3 of charges TOTAL. 1 month later? That was worth $650+ the last thing I was thinking about was some fees mate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:35:56
Which, still would mean bitcoin has its value because it’s serving its purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:33:24
Once the US wakes up it’s going past 11k, this isn’t like previous runs before it the volume of transactions is record breaking. We’re seeing mass adoption.
