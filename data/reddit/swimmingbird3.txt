I just started the vegetable starts a month ago, 
I've got 4 heirloom tomato varieties (Black Krim, Mantinoba, Tiny Tim, and Brandywine Yellow),
5 chili varieties (cayenne, ancho, hot hungarian wax sweet hungarian wax, and cubanelle),

I don't lock my house, and were I to be robbed most people would agree I made mistake in not securing it. But just because I don't lock my house doesn't mean that the robber had the right to steal from me, and it was still legally and morally wrong. There is no difference morally or legally in robbing a locked versus an unlocked house except for how much effort it took on behalf of the thief. 
I torrent TV shows and movies all the time, I currently have several files seeding on BitTorrent at the very moment, so trust me I'm not some old prude. But i still know that its not legal and and that the owner of the media I have pirated would be within their right to pursue action against me. It is a risk I have chose to take and I decided to pirate it because I couldn't afford it otherwise and I have justifications like "The net loss of just *me* torrenting this instead of paying for it is a drop in the ocean to such-and-such producer". I know that it still doesn't put me on the 'right' side though. I think "brutal" is wee bit dramatic
Crowd funding is a great way to launch a service or product but eventually for that product or service to remain viable they eventually have to use a standard business model where customers pay for things. most of the backer rewards could be considered pre-order sales anyways except you have no certainty of ever getting the product you backed. And new business models are already emerging for digital media streaming services have shook up how we consume music, TV series, and movies, and video games. Yes IP is abstract but so are laws, so is the value of fiat money, so is the value of Bitcoin. 
 If you think that we could legally redistribute movies to whom ever we want as much as we want there would be no incentive for producer's to put up hundreds of millions of dollars to make amazing movies or push the boundaries of modern video games. It wouldn't pay off for them, and if it ever reached a point were pirating was so prevalent then we wouldn't have those things in the first place. Open sourcing software and putting out royalty free media is awesome, but if you do that you have to be prepared to never make a dime. Linus Torvalds is actually worth 150 million. He has been extremely lucky and is not representative of most open-sourcer's

You are free to download and develop a game with unity and unreal engines but you must pay a license or fee as soon a you start selling copies of a game. Also only specific tools in Unity are open source, the engine itself is not. Unreal engines source code is available to developers to extend or modify but is also not open source. Both companies still expect you to compensate them if you are making money with their technology. They are just trying to attract more indie developers to their engines because casual hipster indie games have been en vogue for the last few years for some reason.
I'm very familiar with open source, MIT license, etc. I spent several years in college studying software engineering. You don't have to preach it to me. Yes I've 'tried' Linux, it is in no way a replacement for the convenience of Windows and or OS X. 
The difference between us it seems; Is I believe in a free market and I do believe in fundamental IP rights. I do admit that lobbying has lead to overreach in areas of IP law, but that is no reason to throw the baby out with the bath water. I think if people want to charge per copy for the digital goods then they should have the right to do that. And I think if you want it then you need to respect the way they do business or find a different product. Kind of like picking out a restaurant. Unfortunately patent trolls try to stifle competitors but luckily in the software world patent infringements are pretty rare unless you literally Ctrl+C Ctrl+V the code. I appreciate you idealism but you seem to have very black and white thinking on the matter
I don't agree that open source software is inherently better. It can be. But I think there is a handful of examples that are, and shit tons of open source programs that are far worse than commercial programs. Have you seen the annals of Git? It almost doesn't even warrant argument. As far as spying in Windows and Mac, egghhh. Spying is kind of dramatic for ad targeting. It's been a big deal lately I get it, but if Linux was really better Windows and Mac wouldn't still be pushing such good profit margins right now. Linux simply isn't for everyone.

Hillary did have good arguments against Trump. The ability to debate and make good arguments has nothing to do with why she lost. I don't think you understand why he won. 
WHat exactly do you think Trump accomplished with North Korea? From where I stand I see a whole lot of nothing except a photo shoot. They are still pursuing their nuclear programs, and have severed communication with the US. China and South Korea did all the heavy lifting in getting NK to the point it is diplomatically. But in Trumps mind the fact that he got to meet Kim Jong Un some how means that he did all the work. Lol.

Firstly I thank you for such a detailed response. 
 You argued that rights to physical property are inherently organic in nature. I think ownership of a house, car, etc. Is just as abstract as the idea of IP rights. The car is not part of me or an extension of my being. It is simply a car. and there is just a general agreement that I paid for it, ergo its mine. But that "ownership" is extremely abstract, except for of course legally.
 I won't argue that IP rights have over stepped what I consider fair, but I still think they are extremely valuable to people who create content, software, music etc. I also think that everyone should have a right to pursue which ever business model for their IP they want and though I'm sure open source has its pro's its simply not going to replace the traditional license/copy model in our lifetimes probably. Really selling copies of a digital song is no different than an author being entitled to the sole rights to publish and sell his book. This idea 
 On the case of video games, this is probably the least likely to go 'opensource'. The gaming community has shown a general disgust and hatred for micro-transactions and ad revenue for free to play games. The games that use this model are usually targeted at the mobile market because it takes much longer to recoup your investment and mobile games are much easier and quicker to develop than say a modern first-person shooter for game consoles or PC. The gaming industry shows no signs of slowing down in terms of investment on a single title. Most players want to play games on the cutting edge of engine/hardware technology and a free-to-play model with ads or micro-transactions is a stupid bet for any producers to dump several hundred million into the project. Some Game studios spend 5-8 years just developing a game engine for future games which can be several million in of itself. 
Really this is all just a matter of opinion. I thank you for sharing yours

Your assumption that me being a critic of Trump makes me a Obama fanboy is childish and stupid. Never registered democrat in my life, but just a general tip: telling a random stranger on the internet who they are is also monumentally stupid.

Economic growth in the United States is following the same trend that it has since 2009. It proves nothing other than the economy is marginally affected by the current sitting President. The only thing you can say for certain when looking at the historic growth of the US's GDP is that it looks like war is kind of good for it.


The situation hasn't really become any less tense in any case with NK. [They have yet to agree to anything]( real, except *maybe* returning some soldier remains from 75 years ago. [Nor have they ceased their nuclear programs.]( This is kind of funny that Trump's base is eating it up though considering [NK has promised to denuclearize at least 6 times already.]( So it's not historic or special at all except for the cute photo-op Trump's supporters love so much. Most of the *actual* work getting NK to this point (again), has been because of South Korea's relentless commitment to the [Sunshine Policy]( and China finally joining in on stricter sanctions against NK's missile launches which they have always been reluctant to do. Don't forget Trump almost single-handedly screwed this opportunity because of unprovoked twitter rants. As for Russia, Do you mean the Russia that is attempting to divide the American public? Doesn't sound very peaceful, and sadly it's working as the right and left become further and further divided. Why is Trump so eager to do business with Russia when they literally have nothing to offer in terms of economic growth for the US, surely has nothing to do with the fat bailout he got from Russian lenders when he was facing bankruptcy or the fact that they helped him get the presidency...


Remember when he had that secret plan to do destroy ISIS in 30 days, tops? What a crock a fuckin' shit. How do Trump supporters eat up shit like that? It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, it sounds like his "secret plan" was penned by 5 year old in crayola. The Iraqi and Syrian military's get almost all the credit for defeating ISIS. The USA, France, Russia, and UK have certainly aided the effort, but the emphasis is on **aided**. Trump is lucky at best that he happened to reign at a time when he can claim some free wins.
If you don't suffer from confirmation bias (a real logical fallacy unlike your stupid sounding T.D.S.), it's pretty easy to see that Trump is actually the worst president we have ever had. [He is a pathological liar]( [He is stupid]( He does not care about average Americans and is not putting America first, and [he is selling us out for personal gain]( His trade war is not only ineffectual, but is going to wreck the US economy as he continues to escalate tariffs and even imposes them on our closest allies like Canada. 
Is there literally anything positive that Trump has done for the US that isn't full of shit?

1) The Fed was not allowed to keep it and speculate its future value in the first place.
2) "...**stole** from Silk Road..." is an interesting choice of words considering they were breaking US law. "Seized" is more correct. Now I want to make it very clear: I did not want to see Silk Road go, I think it may have reduced violent crimes related to drug sales. However if you're going to operate an illegal business venture anything you lose upon being caught/arrested wasn't "stolen", it was seized.
