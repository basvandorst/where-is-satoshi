But that doesn't mean he is dishonest. Climate change is happening but that's not really us. It's nature that is changing climate. Thousands of years ago the same thing happened.

I was talking about reddit not r/bitcoin. Yes many are very hard liberals but there are also shills. Just like CTR before elections. Why are there 50 anti-trump subs that get to r/all then? When r/esist was so small, it got to r/all somehow (all bots upvoted at the same time)
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:22:31
I have to agree. There are real political shills on reddit. Shareblue paid shills and T_D voluntary shills. Maybe someone is paying shareblue shills to troll here... 
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:14:18
 this is great. We should stop trying to keep them away from hard fork. We need hardfork to MBGA!
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:34:22
Why? It will make bitcoin centralised. Just paypal 2.0
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:19:02
Why? I'm saying how it is. If you don't like Trump, you still shouldn't like bots and shills. It's a bad tactic. Google "CTR" correct the record aka hillary's shills (she spent millions of $ in trolling on reddit). CTR doesn't excist anymore but now we have Shareblue shills. Also, have you ever wondered why all the media hates Trump? They didn't post anything about war crimes and other things about other politicians. He is threat to the (ex)ruling elite. That's why.

Okay, thanks for advice!
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:34:12
Dude, you have to wait for a hard fork. Right now mining is impossible for you.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:33:26
Trump is not bad. He is at least honest and more transparent than others.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:26:48
Okay, tell me approximate time. Next month? Or could BU fall? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:55:06
Mods stick this
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:32:48
Bitcoin is decentralised. Most important thing is nodes. And soon they are going to destroy miners and there will be decentralization again
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:01:45
Bitnodes.co says that only 1 UASF node running currently :(
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:24:59
Okay, I'm not complete noob. I'm very interested in bitcoin and know a lot more than noobs. I just don't follow this BU thing and now i'm outdated.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:13:52
But there is a bug in code
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:26:20
6 is not good number. 666 is very evil number
7 is nice number, 777 is very lucky number. When trump will be president he will be 70 years 7 months 7 days old. He will be president this year 5777th year in Hiebrew calendar 
8 is good number. 888 is very good number. It is simbolizes compleatness
Baam. There is no Illuminati. ITS KEK

@_date: 2017-04-02 07:50:18
That's r/politics. Most of them are brainwashed idiots. Some of them are shills.

Not all miners. Some powerful miners
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:26:42
Tell that to miners :)

@_date: 2017-07-04 19:55:30
No, you just don't want to give up the control to miners.
Miners don't have any bitcoin values. They do it for money. Only for money.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:01:55
I think wikileaks will just use it for other reasons if necessarily. But they usually don't spend bitcoins, they wait while their vaulue will grow and use only if really necesseary
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:23:02
We don't have presidents here
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:53:21
 NO!
