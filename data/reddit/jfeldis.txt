The long sync time is due to the need for your computer CPU to verify every block.
If you want a simple fast solution, there is bitseed.org

The time to "sync up" a full node is not usually due to the download time.  This is a common misunderstanding.   The long time is what it takes your PC to validate every block ever mined and create an index.  This is what makes bitcoin secure

Bitseed runs bitcoind and adds rudimentary php UI.  It would be nice if someone wanted to make a sexy alternative UI :-)   The device uses only open source code.

A dispaly monitor is not necessary, but a Bitseed can show you its status via a simple web page from any local computer

Bitnodes uses the donate bitcoin address field to verify that the node is the one you registered.  The donate address should be the same bitcoin address you used to register for bitnodes.  This is set up automatically via our setup script, but to add it manually, place the address in the file called reward-addr in the home directory.  The status page will read that file and display it on the Donate line.

The long 'sync' time is actually more due to the time your CPU needs to validate every block every and build an index.  Download speed is not usually the limiting factor

One option is to get a Bitseed Full Node 
It is a ready-to-go full node.  It comes with a synced blockchain, uses only about 10 watts of power and just needs to be plugged into power and network.   It is a really easy and convenient way to run a full node 24/7

A larger block size limit does not really affect a node directly.  However, if a too-small block size causes transactions to be delayed and re-transmitted, this uses more RAM in the node.  RAM is much more expensive than disk space.  $10 per GB vs pennies per GB.  So solutions that minimize RAM use will help keep the cost of a node low.

RAM is much more expensive than disk space.  RAM is like $10/GB while HDD is pennies per GB.  RAM is best used when speed is needed.  It will be least costly to run a node if RAM is minimized and data is on disk whenever possible.

Probably the biggest advantage to the device is that the setup is super simple.  Just plug it into power and network.  This allows people who don't have the time or know-how to have a way to easily support the newtork.

Thank you all for your participation in the AMA!!   We will continue to follow up on any comments for next few days.

Node performance is well within the desired parameters for a node.  Bitnodes.io rates and ranks nodes, and Bitseed devices tend to have ranks around of 1000-1200 out of 6000 and scores around 8.5.   My test node is tracked on bitnodes.io here 
The quality of your internet connection is a very big factor in the score.  The device keeps up with the bitcoin network quite well.

There is no reason why TOR and VPN cannot be added to the device as it is.  I have done this on a proof of concept basis.  
The main things to keep in mind:
1) Do you want to run a Tor relay or a bridge?  Do you want to be visibly be running Tor?
2) Consider the bandwidth needed to support a Tor relay.  The device can handle it, but it can use up a good portion of a home ISP connection
3) VPN usually requires a subscription
The is an excellent add-on project I would love to see on assembly.com:  A Tor and VPN install and setup script.

Bitseed V2 will be available in the summer and have a few more features and sides of the box will be enclosed.  If you want to get a unit right now, Bitseed V1 is available now and will do the job.

Currently, there are 100's of open source bitcoin related projects that developers are supporting for free.  We would like to do better than that and start to build an ecosystem to support open source blockchain projects.  Every journey begins with one step.
I think few people are getting paid full-fare for bitcoin and open source.   The Bitseed team is not paid at this point in time.  Everything goes back into the product.  This is the ground floor and we do it because we believe in the technology and the vision of decentralized open source.

It is a chicken-and-egg scenario.  A good app can really drive sales, so the royalty rate depends on the success of the product.  We are at a very early stage, so projections are very speculative.
Our intent is to channel a reasonable portion of sales margins into the assembly coin royalty stream as a way to encourage developers and allow the community to have a stake in the product.
Importantly, the apps do not have to be bitcoin-specific.  The device can run most other alt-coin blockchains, so the door is open to some interesting blockchain innovations.
If you have a big project or product in mind, please contact us.

I compiled bitcoind on the device.   You have to add about 1GB swapfile or the build will fail.  If you dont have any swap, then that could be the problem.
We also keep 1GB swap on the production units just-in-case.

It would be possible to plug in a mining device via USB.   Mining ASICs have a tendency to become obsolete very quickly as the arms race for hashing power continues.
If someone wants to write the setup scripts to install and configure, a USB miner could be offered as an option for product.  Our assembly.com community is a good place to propose this project

It turns out that when bitcoind hits the maxconnections and stops accepting incoming connections, bitnodes.io will consider it to be "down".  Not good for those wanted the incentive and/or a good score.
I am not sure what value to pick.  I am on a moderate 5/50 mbps comcast home connection.  Currently, seeing less than 0.5mbps uploading and 2mbps downloading for my entire network -  no QOS issues despite running up to 5 of these at once.
Ideal case is to have a tool that can help adjust the device play nice within ISP limits

In about 60 days from the end of the crowd sale.  We want to collect up orders to make a bulk purchase of parts.
@_date: 2015-05-21 05:57:18
The default for the device is the default for bitcoind.   I think that is 128 connections.  This can be easily customized by adding maxconnections=&lt;n&gt; in bitcoin.conf
Currently, one of my test devices is handling 90 connections.

From the standpoint of running a node, the last thing we would want is for RAM to get flooded with stuck or re-sent transactions.  Gavin claims that if the size isn't increased, this might happen.
RAM is the most expensive part of the hardware needed for a node (at least 10x the cost of disk space).  The node client should be optimized to minimize RAM use.

We can make a 1TB version.  Contact us and perhaps we can arrange it.  contact

A laptop will draw around 60 watts of power (or maybe more for an old one). The Bitseed device uses only about 10 watts.
If your electric is $0.25 per kwh, Biseed will cost about $22/year. A typical laptop is about 6x that = $130/yr.  Less money, smaller, quieter (no fans) and probably more green.
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:35:52
The devices should run as long as the blockchain fits on the hard disk (probably several years), and as long as bitcoind v0.10 is supported by the network (likely several years).  
We would like to put in place an upgrade script to allow update of the bitcoin binaries.  This is best accomplished through an improved user interface so people can opt-in for updates
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:51:57
More than 70 so far.  Not bad for a very basic developer unit.   There is some interest in larger bulk purchases as well.  We need community support with software and features to take it to the next level.  The assembly.com system will let contributors share in the growth
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:17:43
I don't claim to know if Gavin's analysis is correct.  It is also possible there are other ways to keep RAM use low. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 18:47:27
Unfortunately, downloading the blockchain is the easy part.  Verifying and indexing the entire blockchain is very RAM and CPU intensive and is what takes the time.  Certainly a high-end computer can do this in a few days (at least for now), but a smaller device will take much longer.  It is much cheaper to add more storage space for a backup than to add a more RAM and CPU power.
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:28:44
Bitcoind really needs 1GB RAM to run properly.  Most VPS offerings I have seen will run about $10/mo to get equivalent capabilities.  
Also, VPS rental servers are very centralized.  If 1000 nodes all run at the same AWS data center, this is not necessarily good for a decentralized network
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:22:14
The Bitseed device already has the build tools and dependencies installed.  You can build your own binaries right on the device by cloning the official bitcoin github source and following the standard unix build instructions.  It takes about 2-3 hours.  
When done, just delete or archive the old binaries in /home/linaro and copy the new binary files bitcoind and bitcoin-cli from the src directory into /home/linaro.

There have been some improvements in memory management in the latest bitcoin v0.11.0 release.  This should allow it to handle more peer connections more smoothly, and help avoid slowdown of the device due to RAM getting filled-up.
I have also noticed that the average number of peer connections on my node has increased with 0.11.0
Another factor may be the recent transaction flooding stress tests and attacks, which might increase latency when active.   If you want to further manage potential flooding, v0.11.0 allows the node to reject low fee transactions if desired via minrelaytxfee and limitfreerelay settings in bitcoin.conf.
Details here

If you have only 8 peer connections, bitcoin is not accepting incoming connections.  
I have found that UPNP is sometimes inconsistent, so if you have not already opened port 8333 it may help.  I also found on one occasion my router just stopped forwarding the port. Rebooting the router fixed it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:28:04
The idea is a simple no-fuss way to add an independent bitcoin full-node at your own location.  Take it out of the box, plug it to power and network, and the node runs.  Uses about 10 watts power.
UPNP is enabled in bitcoin.conf, so if your router has UPNP enabled, it *should* allow more than 8 connections.  If your router doesn't support UPNP, you can open port 8333  manually in the router settings.  If not, it will just run with 8 connections.
It is not a miner.  Just a verification node.  However, these are needed to secure the network.  There were over 10,000 of them a year ago, now it is less than 5000.

Bitcoin can run for a while on an SD card, but SD cards are not meant for frequent writes and fail quickly.  bitcoind will eventually start to report database errors.  Blockchain is already over 26GB.  160GB HDD should last a while

I heard it.  That is the best tag line I have heard in along time. It should be a meme!  Every time we are told we can't do something, we should say "because America is a free country"
