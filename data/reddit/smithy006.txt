You seem to ignore the unfortunate fact that 80% of small businesses still consider a POS system to be a digital cash register, the only thing that remotely resembles a computer in their store is their debit/cc/EFTPOS terminal.  So I think no matter how well BTC gets integrated into a Windows/Unix based POS system, you're still going to have a shitload of SME's that will use a solution like this

100% correct, it's designed to appeal to a politicians desire for control, he basically said, bitcoin is like cash but mastercard is like cash with meta data that we will allow you to regulate, control and use for whatever purpose you want.

Express option is to be competitive with other ways of converting your bitcoins into fiat/goods/services.  We want people to get hold of the cards as quickly as possible, tracking is a must as well because the cards are essentially cash, we have no control over them once they're posted, so really even if it was standard post, it would have to be registered which isn't much different to express in pricing.

No need to be rude about it.
Actually I've had over a decade of experience working in the POS and Gaming industries, and I'm sorry but most small businesses are still using the old cash registers, I'm not saying all are, and believe me I know the benefits extremely well and I think they're crazy for doing so but If I walk down the main street in the CBD where I am right now, I would say it would be well over 70% are using the old style cash register.
I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just saying that's what it is, I'm sure if you lived in San Fransisco or other places it may be different.
I agree with the statement that small business are however best positioned to take advantage of bitcoin, a lot of these big chains will rely on Micros and others to provide BTC integration before they even consider it, I've worked with a number of these chains (1000 + locations) and unless it's simple as fuck so that the 14 year old serving can do it without having to learn anything new, they won't touch it.

You would be better off getting pro's in who don't know much about bitcoin to design the site, considering it's going to be one of the first stops for most people exploring bitcoin, the whole thing needs to be dumbed right down, the design inherently assumes knowledge of bitcoin which is a big problem imho.

As someone who has gone through months of apple app approval hell (not bitcoin related) This is pretty damn accurate.

The logic is non existent and there's zero accountability when it comes to their decisions, the NSA has more open processes than the app store review team.

The bitcoin economy is a spec today compared to what it'll be in 3 or 4 years time.

The people who make the money on mining are the ones who get the fastest miners first before the masses do and the difficulty adjusts accordingly.

Governments can't ban bitcoin its impossible to stop,once the algorithm starts you can't stop it, the technology is peer to peer like bit torrent, counties actually have laws banning torrent sites in various countries and it still hasent stopped bit torrent, same applies with bitcoin but, also what bitcoin has going for it is that as larger companies get involved (you know the ones that have dedicated lobbyists) Governments will embrace bitcoin and create legislation around it, despite what many politicians say government is all about money(people second, sometimes), and while bitcoin remains valuable, governments around the world will leave it alone. What the 2008 financial crisis proved was a lot of what we thought were safe investments was actually bullshit, lots of people lost their 401ks and the bankers still cashed in, Personally, I'd rather invest in something that's decentralised and not controlled by the old money, you at least know that the rules are the same for everyone.

Serious question, how exactly could this be achieved?  
They would have to have some kind of API into their accounting system, but you'd also have to somehow convert the bank feed info into something practical that the public can interpret and then provide constructive feedback on it.
Say for example, you had an invoice for 5000 pounds for some kind of Piping for sewer, you'd need A LOT more info than what you get from a bank feed to be able to assess that and work out if it's value for money or not.  i.e. you'd need to know exactly what specific project and the circumstances around the job it's for to know whether you can get away with for example something cheaper.  
As another example, Someone could look at an item that says cleaning fees and a member of the public would say joe blows cleaning is cheaper, but again it could be that the contract happens to be for a toilet that's in the middle of a pub district that has to get cleaned 4 times a night because of the madness that goes on.
The amount of information you'd need to be able to get constructive feedback imho would mean you'd be employing a team of people to manage the thing which makes the whole point of finding savings somewhat redundant.
I'm not saying I don't like the concept, I just think the practicality of it has been overlooked.

We've all been there I brought a whole bunch of ATI graphics cards back in the day and then some antminers when they first came out, in hindsight buying BTC straight up is always more profitable, it's not just the equipment but the work involved ensuring they're always running and not bugging out etc, plus power costs etc for all its worth buying BTC is always the better choice.

In government there's thresholds for what has to go to tender and what doesn't, so essentially you're just saying anything that has gone to tender (where there is documentation on the exact requirements) should be tied into the blockchain which is a fairly practical way to do it.  But the thing is anything gone to tender has been put to the market for the most competitive deal, it's pretty hard to say we could have gotten a better deal because the response to the tender is the market response.  If you want to ensure that the pricing is open, just make it open, but it needs to be open after the tender has been choosen.  There's often only a handful of players for big government contracts and if they know what the competition is charging i.e. it's out in the open, you often get price collusion, it's a game of who can rip off the government the most.

@_date: 2015-04-13 08:37:15
Let me start off by saying, I don't know you, nor do I know this Chris guy but...
- To be fair to the guy, he wouldn't be making much if anything at all from the ATM, it's not really practical to pay someone 28k per year to man a phone(maybe less if overseas contract) and have an instant support hotline, he likely has a second job to make a living, so missing phone calls isn't significant.
- He should have responded to your first email within a timely manner, or called you back the same day (You didn't say whether the guy did or not, and you haven't told us the content of the 2 ignored emails, i.e. whether or not you were abusive etc, maybe he responded to your first email within 30 minutes?)
- Banks don't provide compensation for errors and lost currency value to your standard customers either, so why should a small operator be forced to pay compensation.
- It would probably take days and 2.5 + hours on hold with a Bank to fix an ATM error, so again I don't think that's fair.
- I agree on the last point but, the guy should cover the transaction fees i.e. at least refund that.
I just think you're probably being a little bit unfair, I can understand you sound pissed, and if anything, any business that pisses off a customer isn't smart because inevitably they'll tell the world about it (like you have) but I don't think you're being very balanced about it.
But then again, only you and this Chris guy know all the details, there's a lot missing from this post...
