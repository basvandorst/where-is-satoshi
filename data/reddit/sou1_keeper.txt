A currency that's been out for 10 years... that's 1/25th of the USD

I'm wondering how does it keep dipping below 10k? Who in their right mind would sell bitcoin before we see a price like 12k or 13k?
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:47:50
Okay, we could easily go under 10k and stay under for an extended amount of time so just be ready for that lol

Lol you don't get how this all works... buy as low as you can and sell as high as you can, it's all a guess you're almost gambling right now. It's like betting on your favorite sports team, you hope it does well but it might lose. But the good part is even when it loses you can hold onto the coin until next time it shoots up

Understandable. Your original question was when can you buy, who has done the research to know when it's okay to buy. The answer is we are fluctuating between 10k and 13k right now but that could go to 9k or 15k at any point so the fact we are at 10.5k right now it's safe to buy now

Not sure if I'm the right one to answer but it's just a feeling I get and then I go for it based on what I've seen and done since joining up
