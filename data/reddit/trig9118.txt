Or if that's still too complicated for your special brain, just remember you can make money off a 0 volatility asset.

If nothing's said on this sub matter why have you spent 2 years shilling here.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:09:24
I genuinely wish for your sake you don't think meteorology and TA have the same credibility.
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:28:59
Implying it was ever useful and not a massive speculative bubble.
It's only use is to try to make a quick buck. Don't even pretend that isn't what 99% of this sub thinks, despite all the memes of holding.
You get out at the right time, you make a killing. Otherwise, you're left holding shit.

How the fuck do you not re-read your own comments before replying. Is this a troll account where multiple people are sharing?
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:28:44
Followed by Monday dump yep
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:27:28
This reads like a Trump tweet.
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:52:33
So price is going up except when it doesn't? What an amazing insight.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:13:24
Sure you did buddy. There's a reason I'm so sure that you're a shill ;)
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:36:32
So this sub isnt for discussions and is just an echo chamber.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:13:11
You can make money on a low volatility asset and you can make money on a high volatility asset - volatility has nothing to do with how profitable an asset is, it just defines what strategy and investor type it attracts. Day traders look for high volatility assets where the intraday spread is high, for example. Your assertion that somehow a high volatility asset is more profitable in the long run than an index fund is demonstrably wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:41:31
Guys, please could you keep buying the dip and hodling. I would like btc/usd pumped to a price where it is massively profitable for me to dump my coins.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:08:08
You must be new here. Any bearish sentiment gets down voted. Bear meaning mentioning any price lower than the current one.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:57:40
No you can't? What kind of stupidity is this....
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:09:36
Lmao, "pathetic" coming from a guy who "scans" for down votes. Oh my fucking LOLs.
I didn't down vote you before, but I just did now. What does your scan say about that?
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:23:09
Put all your money on red, that has also proven to net you huge gains.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:47:49
S'alright buddy you can swear on here. Might want to double check grammar, though, if you want people to take your shilling seriously.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:40:54
Historians will read your posts and laugh.
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:59:23
4% of Americans also fell to scams last year. 
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:56:03
Fucking lol. 2/10 shilling.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:05:36
That's a fair analysis, but you didn't account for the bearish anticlockwise swirl of the tea leaves, which is supported by strong descending symbols on three of five Oracle bones.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:17:09
Yes. Buy bitcoin. Wait till 2022 where it will go to 100000000 dollars. Sell your bitcoin. Invest in a tech startup called SpaceNook. Sell 2 months after their IPO. You're now the richest man on Earth. Put it all on black. Lose. Go home and cry.
@_date: 2019-07-26 08:36:15
If you bought at 19K, you would have lost more money than 15 years on SP500.
Whats the point of this post. Bitcoin is highly volatile so obviously the wins and losses are greater than the stock market. It's not special in any way. Go to a spread betting site and put down highly levered bets on TSLA and I guarantee your wins and losses will be greater than bitcoin. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:41:32
Lol you could practically taste the angst and frustration behind those emojis
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:13:46
Do you also respond to Nigerian princes?
@_date: 2019-07-26 07:12:32
Last chance to sell above 9K
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:39:14
Fucking lol. It's trolling to say you don't believe in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:44:30
Oh I'm sorry, I thought this was a forum. I guess it's actually a bull echo chamber.
No, not a speculative bubble at all./s
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:34:13
People in 2025 will be lamenting that they didn't sell in 2019.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:21:30
The price is irrelevant. My point is bitcoin will naturally have greater gains and losses than a well diversified stock market index. Your post tries to spin bitcoin in a positive light but all it's saying is bitcoin is more volatile than the SP 500.
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:47:35
Heigh ho! Heigh ho!
Back under 10K we go.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:45:08
Oh I just did it again, did you get your notification?
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:58:04
I just told you the reason, wtf. Are you special?
Why are you even replying to me if you're a true believer? Go keep amassing your bitcoins. Are you just a saint who wants others to share the wealth? Or do you deep down know it's worthless unless there's a constant influx of people buying it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:06:22
Yep. It will always be worth some pennies since there's always delusional people out there, but effectively 0
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:08:13
You're right. Bitcoin is definitely a better way to gamble.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:46:22
Yeah you're not trying to prove anything at all. /s
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:07:24
He's absolutely right here. Something something broken clock.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:01:37
Yeah okay you're either a bot or retarded.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:45:33
Take your own advice :)
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:03:32
In a world without central banks and just bitcoin, how do you propose we get a mortgage for a house?
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:01:40
So what are you suggesting then?
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:03:49
How? Why do we have bitcoin whales if wealth is equalised?
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:47:56
Are you suggesting we would be better off going back to how things were centuries ago? Not sure I would agree with that.
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:41:05
Why? Bitcoin doesn't address anything about wealth inequality.
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:28:40
I know, but since you replied I thought you had something to contribute.
So what was my strawman then? It sounds like you agree we should go back to a time when loans didn't need banks and houses didn't need loans?
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:16:58
How do you know that
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:07:39


What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:13:15
And money will flood into Gold ETFs, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:59:29
So, I'm guessing you're not a long term holder then?
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:23:11
Who do you think can last longer, banks keeping their branches closed or people trying to live without access to their money?
Bank runs are only effective when it's sustained over a period, a flash mob is going to be fuck all effective. The protesters may have good intentions but they're dumb as rocks.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:21:10
It's scary isn't it. Though not surprising with the resurgence of flat earthers, antivaxxers, and other idiots.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:21:32
Because Bitcoin isn't worth that.
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:14:53
What makes you think it will crawl back up. I think it's as likely to go the other way and fall to 4K range.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:35:51
And how does bitcoin solve debt or wage stagnation? Why not also mention other irrelevant issues like cancer, aids and pollution?
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:02:45
Lol remember when it dipped below 9K and people were saying it's dead, and now it's back to 8.3 people are saying moon
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:50:08
What an absolute load of horseshit lol
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:44:34


@_date: 2019-10-01 22:09:37
Glad someone asked this, it's like people are just attributing bitcoin as the solution to any problem. Kind of reminds you of snake oil sellers or MLM shills who push their product as a magical fix it all.
@_date: 2019-10-02 14:43:08
Very apt. Jon Snow was a fucking idiot who abandoned all logic and succumbed to emotion in that scene. Just like some people here.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:33:41
Lol who the fuck do you think you are, some general in a war?
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:01:35
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:55:06
I phoned up my buddies at the big banks, deep state, and tech giants to brigade this post.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:22:58
No the bull run is over. Sell now before it dips another 80%.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:45:17
Yes, think about it, when you're 120 you will be a billionaire and your friends will be dead. Who has the last laugh?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:41:32
That's a 8.32/10.0 dead cat bounce. Good air time but landing let it down.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:30:59
If (price.up || price.down) {console.writeline("this is good for bitcoin");}
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:26:00
Exactly. I wish more people understood this. I am worth over $12 million but all these idiots do is mock my basement of tulips and beanie babies.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:35:08
I'll regret later thanks
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:18:17
Time to sell, it was an alright bull run.
