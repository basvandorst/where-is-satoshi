First scenario. Let's say you invest $100 into bitcoin. Your investment rises 2x. You take $100 out and leave $100 as BTC. Now bitcoin still rises 5x. You sell all BTC for $500. You now have $600.
Second scenario. Invest the same amount, $100. Bitcoin rises 2x. You hold. Bitcoin rises 5x. You sell for $1,000. You now have $1,000.
In the first strategy you minimize the risk of losing $100 but at the same time you are making possible future profits smaller.
If you can't afford to lose the initial $100, you shouldn't invest at all.

Ok, I understand that it's not free for the store to offer the Visa payment option. But it's not the Visa users who are paying for it. Everyone pays the Visa fees because they are included in the price of the products already. 
Just by switching to bitcoin you can't escape the credit card fees. Maybe if, and that's a big if, large enough number of people start using bitcoin then stores will drop the Visa option or they can force Visa to change their policies. I don't see this happening anytime soon, if ever.

While a nice thought, the answer is no, we can't. A collective agreement between tens of thousands (?) of people - including trolls, teens, people who just don't care - is near impossible.

Bitcoins are mined. Only idiots buy. I rest my case. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:37:15
Wow, I don't know why I thought/remembered it was hundred thousand. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:17:31
You sound really immature. I guess you're around 14 years old. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:07:36
How do you know it's the largest? What was the second largest? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:13:10
What's the problem? You get 8% back easily in a week.

It's nice to go to bed every night knowing you'll make more money while you sleep than at your day work. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:30:38
You have proven that you are a complete idiot. Congratulations.

I don't think you understand how the bitcoin value is formed. 
If we have a market cap of $25 billion, it doesn't mean that we need another $25 billion to double the value. 
If what you said would happen, bitcoin value would probably be $100,000 or something. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:58:02
This is the final crash. Bitcoin is officially dead. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:21:27
There's not gonna be a dip.

Thank you Mr IRS but no thanks.

Is this some kind of reverse version of the bitcoin pizza?

Is there a price chart that shows BTC/USD instead of the more common USD/BTC? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:36:29
Before I finish typing this comment.

Drawing some regression curves on excel does not count as analysis IMHO. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:10:48
In most aspects, it's not the same. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:50:24
On what date are we going to hit $2000?
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:38:30
Is a lie. No potato.

This does not apply to the new mainstream Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:01:36
You said it. Normal economics apply to bitcoin. There's more demand than supply, therefore the price goes up. The demand is only going to increase now that bitcoin is going mainstream. I'd say it takes a couple of years before majority of people have adopted bitcoin. 
We are looking at 2-3 years of increasing demand and because people are hodling the price will only go up. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:39:45
Yeah, sounds scammy. More like "Bitcoin is **not** well in South Africa". 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:48:48
Bitcoin is 50% more valuable than gold! 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:46:46
We could erase a lot of problems in the world if all people donated 1% of their money, but it's not going to happen so there goes that. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:02:05
$10,000 is perfectly realistic this year. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:30:56
Use bitcoin as a value store or investment for now. It will stabilize in a decade and then it can be used as a currency.

With $75k you can live couple of years in a nice villa by a beach in Thailand. During those years you have plenty of time to start a profitable internet business. Not a bad plan. Friends are transient. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:17:54
Oh no. Bitcoin is up only 200% since a year ago. I'm shitting my pants here. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:17:05
Women are relevant! Like there was that scientist, Marie Curie, who did something radioactive and I'm sure there are other important ones too. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:25:35

@_date: 2017-06-23 10:30:10
Bitcoin is a value store (similar to gold), not an everyday currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:12:33
Isn't it easier to manage a single wallet than multiple wallets?
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:22:31
Yeah, even the original quote makes very little sense, and trying to somehow adapt it to bitcoin makes no sense at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:03:10
Comparing Bitcoin market cap to GDP is apples to oranges. It would be more interesting to compare to the total amount of fiat money a country has. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:01:13
How does BTC compare to other currencies?

I bet 99.9% of readers don't know where Limburg is, neither do I. By the sound of the name I guess Central Europe.
