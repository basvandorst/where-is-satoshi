law of supply and demand

i'm looking at it and seeing what may be mankind's first *permanent* currency.  unless something vastly better comes along.
the market is unstable right now but i'm more nervous about the USD/Euro market in the long run than about Bitcoin.  most of this price instability is what you might call a unique sociological phenomenon.  people have never had to adapt to a currency with Bitcoin's characteristics before.

there are millions of companies i've never heard of.  doesn't make them any less real.

if a terrorist attack took out the electric grid?
same thing's true of credit cards.  people depend on those.  
it's absolutely feasible to have miniature devices that store a wallet.dat file, as a regular currency.  wouldn't even cost a cent to make, if it was done right.

the question is really about the risk vs. benefit to the consumer, that is the only basis for free market adjustment to occur regarding bitcoin-based banking.   there is generally a risk of a bank run occurring with FRB, while the so-called "creation of value" - the ability to give loans to multiple people by lending out your deposits - is only worthwhile for the depositors if it generates interest.  
so, the bank is responsible for ensuring that its reserves don't run so low that a bank run occurs, but it has to compete based on how much of an incentive people have to deposit there - how much interest they get on their deposits.  there is a direct balance between the two.
so it would probably end up looking a little more like an investment banking system, than the sort of Bank of America, HSBC, Wells Fargo system we have now, where loans are more like a piano hanging over your head than something you use to help society.

law of supply and demand guys.  low demand and high supply creates low prices.  we are seeing a drop in demand.
if you ask me, bitcoin is unstable because people don't understand how much of the conventional currency market bitcoin is going to take over (quite a bit).  
various governments are not helping the currency instability with the little cops-and-robbers game they're trying to play against it, either, which is an artificial barrier to adoption of bitcoin by conventional businesses.  so as always, a big middle finger to them.
 as long as there is demand and supply, bitcoins will have a value.  people would be fools to sell right now.
also, the inaccessibility of bitcoins isn't helping either (thanks a lot paypal!).

the speculation bubble is deflating a little because of the thing i stated there.  there is slower adoption by businesses than those speculators anticipated.
also, you can buy all kinds of shit.  i'm thinking about getting some peyote.  it's on there.
oh shit, did i write that out loud...

central banks only destabilize the value of a currency, since the value of a currency is a function of its acceptance and its supply.

permanent as in, "from now on."   
it's really hard to say.  honestly it seems more and more likely we're moving towards a gift economy anyway...

currencies are commodities.

they both have their advantages and disadvantages.
technically, as long as we have intermediaries/web of trust, the difference between them is next to meaningless, except that Bitcoin's supply is asymptotic...but so is gold's supply...
well, once it's fully implemented (which it is NOT), i still have to say Bitcoin makes a better currency for some uses.  especially online trading.

what about all the other companies?

the secret of bitcoin is that it doesn't go away.
