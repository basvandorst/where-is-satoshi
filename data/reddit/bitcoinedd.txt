Due to the recent and ongoing extreme value decrease of Bitcoins, Bitspend has had to temporarily suspend our order taking. We are sorry if this causes you any inconvenience. The order form will reopen as soon as the Bitcoin Gods are done playing this cruel joke on the rest of us silly mortals. 
Thank You, 
The Bitspend Team
So it seems as of right now I can't actually use that service even if I wanted to.

Who's doing this work though? Certinaly not you or any other 'buy and hold' bitcoin investor who let all the liquidity in the market dry up when the flurry of amature buyers needed you to sell them cheap bitcoins the most.
But you know what, I will agree with you somewhat, bitcoins and the community do need a lot of work. Tons. That's why I believe the massive risk involved in merely holding onto a bitcoin makes its value a fraction of what it actually is.

wrong and downvoted; there are plenty of forex subreddits

said the man with a heavy long interest ;)

Does the difficulty and risk involved in exchanging it for a more commonly accepted currency make it worth it though?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:14
I guess I just don't get where all this confidence in the currency is coming from. Its great that I can send bitcoins to my friends in Russia and on Reddit but they still won't buy me a bag of groceries. I guess I could justify the price of a coin if I saw all kinds of neat and innovative ways to spend and use my money, but right now we still seem to be having trouble getting money from one person to another. Everything seems to need a lot of work.

so many people want you to buy the thousands of bitcoins the purchased over the past months
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:28:07
See I'm not so sure about that. I think a lot of average uneducated blog readers got in at the top. I read at least a few reddit posts about a kid who got grounded cause he lost some of his dads money and a man who lost five years of savings and maybe a marriage over night. Since I'm on the internet I'm inclined to believe their trolls but still, things like that do happen.
At the end of the day I'm not a total bear on bitcoins. I want to like them and use them, but I can't find a reason for their current price tag. They may be worth that much to me some day, but that day is not today or even tomorrow.

ps fucking keep it
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:24:12
ok, I can see the appeal for someone who needs to move around very very large amounts of money between two people for reasons we aren't required by anyone to make note of. what about for me who wants to buy a car and get pizza this weekend?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:05:50
Its not easy though, and you can't deny the massive risk involved. This is supposed to be a way to pay for things, not a way to make money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:12:01
I believe its still possible to do that with cash in all situations where a reciept isn't made
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:40:04
So I convert my USD to BTC, a process which may or may not be one of the most frightening trades out there, then use a middleman who may or may not be charging money for services to shop at places already accepted the currency I converted from?
I'm not -trying- to shit on bitcoins, you're just not making them sound convienient.

upvoted the OP because we need well thought out arguments from bears. just because you are a bear on the price of an asset does not mean you are a bear on the asset itself. 
"Also, look at how many bitcoin exchanges are up compared to how many REAL merchants are ready to accept it? It's symptoms of an asset bubble ready to burst."
This right here. Everyone is paying a future price for a product that may or may not be incredibly useful in the future, but right now you really can't do much with a bitcoin. Go ahead, try to pay some bills or get soemthing to eat with your bitcoins. Until you can do at least some basic things with these coins they will have no real value.

thats a shame because despite the hurried formating its a well thought out bear case
