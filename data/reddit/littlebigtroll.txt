What helps me is the fact that I bought $50 of BTC 'quite some time ago', and even though technically that $50 has now become 'significantly' more, I still tell myself it is still actually only $50 right up until the very instant that I convert it back to cash (not accounting for 'fiat deflation' which the sleazebag banker economists 'price inflation', but I digress...).

BCH attracts the more impatient class of the crypto crowd than BTC does. I have a strong feeling that BCH is going to be around for some time fleecing crypto-noobs. The determination of BCH shills is impressive.

Of your three questions, it would appear that the third answers the first. The lucrative nature of a cryptoken reciprocates stability. Or is it the other way around. Chicken before the egg?
As to the second question, and honestly for the foreseeable future for the first and third, does it matter? BTC is the ace in the hole against the established method of a select few undermining national sovereignty via privately owned central banks. If globalism is to be made manifest, it will now be *forced* to afford the everyman new liberties never before experienced since the days of paper money being (fractionally) used to represent gold. BTC hodlers are, knowingly or not, shorting abominations like the BIS. It is a win win either way. BTC profiteers are simply keeping the gears greased. Zoom out your chart!
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:29:42
It's a win win! First they extract your bitcoins at pennies on the dollar speculatively, then they kill you invisibly with a root canal that leads to heart failure. Well, if they can keep the screams inside their heads silent and avoid suicide, of course...

We can agree that BTC needs to evolve and mature, however I disagree with you that the shtiposters do also. Shtiposting is a celebration, not an expression of greed.
Greed is profiting off of pumps and dumps. Greed is flipping shticoins. Greed is shorting.
BTC will evolve and mature *when it is ready*. When is that? When it is required to do so. In the natural world, evolution works because each mutation gets tested *thoroughly*, which take time. The BTC developers understand.
*Necessity is the mother of invention*. Have patience friend, with BTC and with shtiposters!

I assume that because I used the 'cold' method which involves having Electrum and the wallet on a machine with no network access, and a second Electrum in 'watch only' mode that is online, that I am not affected?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:26:42
In the case of bitcoin hot wallet, you can use something like 'Electrum' and a machine that *NEVER* goes online, and have a 'watch only' wallet for the online machine, as I understand things. This might actually be considered a 'warm' wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:24:02
That makes sense to me thanks. Interestingly I only bothered to go with cold setup because my exchange doesn't support the segwit. I guess that means I should be grateful the exchange didn't! :-)

Thread doesn't make sense. Esmail has made it very clear he is a hard left communist masquerading as an anti-facist. There have been so many thinly veiled attempts to demonize Bitcoin through the series from the beginning. In a very recent episode Elliot even said that Ecoin needs to be stopped to destroy the dark army.
The only way this show can redeem itself is, if on tonights episode, Elliot dies.

It's important to recognize that no matter what the bought and paid for corporate media that anyone under the age of 50 already recognized as totally and completely full of shit ever says about Bitcoin, good or bad, is good for Bitcoin.

There does exist hardware manufacturers that produce mining hardware that they do not sell, because they make more profit in using this hardware to mining. This secret mining is part of what has driven some alt coins to fork their coin using different algo's that resist this in support of the everyman's GPU mining, however due to the excess of GPU mining hardware in combination with the (temporary?) collapse of BTC, it simply makes more sense to purchase the BTC using money. For example, a $400USD GPU card will generate perhaps 50 cents of cryptocoin a day, not including the cost of power and the supporting computer to run the GPU card. That is my best and surely flawed understanding of the present state of things.

In fact you can look back (lots of articles have been written showcasing this) across a hundred years and see clearly distinct boom and bust patterns. There is even a repeating pattern regarding generations of people, how it rolls through 4 distinct types of people, generally speaking. It is actually quite disturbing in a way, that things can be so easily predicted, assuming one has the patience to do so.

I'll focus on this to make my contribution to this thread, and while I have yet to listen to the AJR episode in question, I have no doubt this is a significant event.
Alex Jones is *a* man. The people that both worship him, and vilify him, are at the core of everything that is wrong with people. They are lazy, cowardly, and ultimately worth very little in the context of making this world a better place. Anyone who has listened to Alex Jones over the years, well understands this, and he has achieved sainthood for this alone. I can imagine him reading this when I say that I can discern for myself, and agree with some of what he says, and disagree with other things, and can express why or why not all by my little old self, that he would beam with pride of me.
