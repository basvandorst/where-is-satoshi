I've just today set up an email/twitter/facebook to do the same, but over in Manchester, England. I'm focusing on getting small businesses to accept bitcoin, and hoping I can make an income from it

Can't add much other than to say how sorry I feel that Dorian got caught up in all this, poor guy. 
Good luck to the family, and hope Dorian and your Mother both get some peace and quiet soon.

What's "the Asterisk roll out"? Is it to do with the phone system? That's all Google is bringing me. Thanks in advance.

I'm intending to do this starting early this year. Not expecting to get rich off it, but I'd rather do that than work in an office (unemployed atm).
Also I'm in the UK so it might have to be a part time business. For now.

Very basically, It's a count of how many days it has been since a bitcoin has moved somewhere. 
So if I have 1 bitcoin that I haven't touched for 30 days, then I move it between wallets, I've destroyed 30 bitcoin days. If I have 3 bitcoins that I don't move for 10 days, then move them, I've also destroyed 30 bitcoin days.
The reason it's used is as a measure of how active "all" the bitcoins are. If I had 1000 bitcoins and wanted to push the market up, I could fire my bitcoins from one wallet to the next all day long, round and round and round, and every time, it adds to the amount of btc being traded that day, so if I was quick enough, at the end of the day everyone would be all "oh my god, 20000000000 bitcoins have been moved today" even if it's just my 1000 being moved repeatedly. It would look far better than it is. 
However, if that person were to also look at bitcoin days destroyed, they would see through my scam and realise that only 30 btc days were destroyed. If the 200000000 btc were from all over the place (reflecting a healthy btc market) then you'd expect the btc days destroyed number to be much higher. 
So in threads like this, they're basically saying "look, some old bitcoins that haven't been touched for a while are moving" or "look, shitloads of them are moving" - which to be fair is both interesting and important if you're an investor.
