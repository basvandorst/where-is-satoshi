There are virtual items that are way more scarce.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:06:28
It's artificial though.

The faith and backing of the US government.

I'm confused. Why would GTA need Bitcoin? Can you buy stuff in game?
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:25:50
This is not new.
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:17:02
Fuck Apple. I don't know why people use their shit.
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:35:50
What? You have get 6TB hard drives now a days... You can keep videos for months.

That's weird. In the US either person on a joint account can deposit checks as long as it's signed and is payable to either person. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:27:54
Let they really give a shit.

But some countries are going in to negative inflation. They need to print more money.

@_date: 2019-10-15 19:46:56
It's not worth mining now.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:27:51
I think I do cybering pretty good.
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:22:58
But that's the opposite of what the title say

Yeah, 100% efficient electric heater will be better at heating your home than a computers with some GPUs in it. A 1000W computer is not going to heat your home as well as a 1000W heater.
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:23:30
Yeah, a electric heater is 100% efficient because it's made to generate heat. A computer with GPUs are not even close to 100% efficient in terms of making heat.

Simple: 
He's a time traveler.

1.5% fee is pretty low actually.

It's useless if you can't convert the Bitcoin back to rmb.
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:56:23
Yeah, I don't get it. He started in to the job market and is already making 50K. Save some money and move if Cali is too expensive. You don't need a 4 bedroom house.... a small apartment is perfectly fine for now.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:53:25
I'm still kicking myself to this day.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:00:44
what? really?
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:24:12
I know right... Unix computers never gets hacked.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:26:43
OK... so he's not moving the bitcoins he promised? OK so this PROVES he was lying. Wow, what a loser.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:39:14
You can use anything as 'money' between private parties. They can just block you from using US currency to exchange between it and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:28:06
wtf. How would the government and banks collapsing avoid a lot of bloodshed? 
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:47:43
People in this country just don't get it. They think that a 'right' is something that just happens. No, the US government is giving you your 'rights' because they wrote it down in the US 'Bill of Rights' and you are a US citizen. Why don't you try taking your 'natural human right' and go to North Korea? See how far that takes you. If the US government collapse, your 'natural human rights' will disappear until the next government gives you the next set of rights.
