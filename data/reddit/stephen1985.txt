I never understood this, bitcoin will not do away with these institutions.

Bitcoin is dying. The hype is over. Get out now before its worthless

I wouldnt do this if I were you

I have no problem with this, stealing from theives is fine

Cryptocurrency is useful but bitcoin is just too damn slow to ever have any real use.

You got me

Don't bother to actually address any of them tho. Giving money to someone to PREACH doesn't help anyone except the preacher and is not my idea of a charity

But im in it for the dollars, I have more than whdn I started an I have more evety day

Non profits pay tax?
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:35:31
Because I just made some

Its fine for him to make money, but why the fuck should he not pay tax like the rest of us, its bullshit. I might just ask my boss to donate my salary for my charitable endevours, lol I hate that anything religious automatically gets tax exemption.
About churches being a large spectrum, your right but you knew what I meant,  being pedantic wont get us anywhere.

Not true, with the value of btc atm I broke even in less than 2 weeks, now its all free money
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:01:01
GBP I will also point out that I did not buy a knc. I bought a 60gh Avalon which I can promise you I have more than broken even on now. It will only mine 1.5 btc in a month but I only needed 0.7 to cover what I payed

Churches have enough money already, giving money to a religion is not charity its a scam

Thanks for that, obviously delivery is a concern because of the difficulty increases. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to commit that amount anyway. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:56:44
Oh really? Could have sworn I did, oh well you would know 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:40:53
Sell them to me for $2000 everyones a winner :D
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:08:58
Even if I work it out the way you want me to I have already got the amount of btc i could have bought at the time as well so whats your point? 
Your the one being illogical because your stuck on the idea that a miner CANNOT SEE ROI. Did it ever occur to you that I bought it second hand and didnt pay the ridiculous price that some ask.
