This. The most amusing thing I've learned about tax is that the IRS does not give a shit how you made your money, as long as you pay taxes on it. Sell weed? Pay taxes. Illegal gambling winnings? Pay taxes. Bitcoin profits? Pay taxes.

Reddit definitely helped me, a newbie and slight skeptic, make my first exchange. I remember when bitcoin first came about, didn't think much of it until a month or so ago when a buddy brought the topic up again. I dragged my feet as the price got higher, and I started getting discouraged because there was no way I could responsibly afford a $200 BitCoin! 
Then, I started thinking about it not as a commodity to BUY, but rather a currency to EXCHANGE. It wasn't about buying anything, just exchanging one form of currency for another. That made taking the plunge a lot easier, so I hunted around Reddit for a good exchange, found bitfloor, took $60 to my BoA yesterday and now I own about 0.26 of a BitCoin. Maybe my purchasing power will increase, maybe it won't, but I risked what I was willing to, and hopefully it'll work out from there!
The barrier to entry shouldn't be the price of a BitCoin, but rather what you can do with them. Hopefully reddit can help others like me who were skeptical before.

I understand the biblical reference, but not quite how it analogizes. Mind elaborating?

Seems like a bit of a Catch-22. We need more merchants to accept BitCoin for it to become a legit currency, but the volatility kinda dissuades spending. But if no one spends their coins then it's kinda worthless as a currency. 
Of course, BitCoins could become an alternate way to store wealth, like digital gold. It'll be interesting to see which way that goes, or if the whole thing goes to shit.

Ok, that's actually way cooler, thanks!

Hahahahaha, ahhhh shit, sorry guys!

I started re-following bitcoins a few weeks ago when they were at ~$40 per. Same thing, was like, eh, looks like it's tough to buy in, blah blah, price keeps rising, I keep reading up on it, think, huh maybe I should but now a coin is over $200! I don't have that kind of money! Then realize I don't have to buy a full coin.
Used BitFloor, deposited $60 to their account through BoA, bought ~0.26 of a coin, now I'm happy. I'm not going to suddenly become rich, but I spent what I was willing to on this thing, maybe I'll end up with some money, maybe I won't. 
Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. Going about this thinking "I'll get rich!" or a "Man I could've been rich!" is the wrong attitude. BitCoin is supposed to be a CURRENCY not a money making scheme. You're supposed to buy stuff with it, not hoard it in the hopes you'll get rich. Early adopters got lucky because they were willing to take the risk, and it's paid off. Maybe this is the peak, maybe it's not.
Instead of trying to buy X BitCoins, think about it as buying $X worth of BitCoins, where $X is what you'd be willing to spend on things you could buy with BitCoins. If the price goes up, hooray! You made some money and can buy more things! If the price stabilizes, well, you can still buy things! If the price goes down, that sucks, but that's the risk you take, so don't spend more than you can or want to lose. 
Money is only worth what you can do with it.

Psych undergrad? Graduate? Are you licensed? I'm fairly certain you can't run an unlicensed psychotherapy session, if only for malpractice reasons. 
That said, it's not a terrible idea in general. If you could talk to a therapist simply by booting up skype, more people might be willing to seek psychological help. Just make sure you cover your ass in terms of being eligible to practice psychotherapy, etc.

I used Bitfloor. If you have a Bank of America nearby it's insanely easy to fund your account and then buy bitcoins on their exchange.

This is a total ELI5 attempt, since I'm not 100% on it either, but from what I gather, a "mining pool" is a bunch of users "pooling" their computing power to help "mine" blocks to "find" BitCoins. 
BitCoins are "generated" from solving complex math problems (at least in the oversimplified way I understand it) that become more and more complex and require more and more computing power to solve as the number of BitCoins increase (or rather, the more previous solutions are found). Since we're past the point where the average CPU/GPU can efficiently "mine" solo, a lot of people join pools, which essentially distribute the work load to your CPU/GPU. So rather than one ultra-powerful rig solving on its own, you have a bunch of smaller ones heling solve smaller portions.
I guess you could analogize it to mining for gold in some giant pyramidal rock formation. At the beginning, you could just stick a pickax anywhere at the top and get gold, but as you mine away more and more of the surface, the gold becomes more and more spread out. Sure you could keep going on your own, but it becomes more work than it'll likely be worth it with just a pickax. So you band together with a ton of other people with pickaxes, and agree to split whatever you find evenly. 
Hope that helps!

Same! Literally burst out laughing. I finally got around to buying some Bitcoins yesterday (thankfully only a meager $60 worth), and the market drops. I figure it'd happen eventually, but not this soon! Oh well, I'm still glad I have even (now) ~$30 worth, since I'm really interested in seeing where this is headed. I ain't even mad.
