Spray paint it gold and mount it on the wall.  That shit is high art now.

Disconnect the fax machine at night?  Use a blacklist to block the incoming number.  If it's a business line you might ask the provider to open a case on it.  This would be consider SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony) and they may be able to help prevent it.  If it's just a copper POTs line though, you need to block the origin number.

I expect people who get out there and take risks to change the world to have the courage of their convictions.

Looks like tin.

They wont sell.  They'll buy the dip.  Always another way to win.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:08:49
Good way of looking at it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:45:09
So...this is it?
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:19:40
That all sounds like a big headache.  I'm just keeping my classic car.

If the US Govt doesn't recognize BitCoin as real currency, what grounds do they have for making the request?
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:48:14
How would they know when I acquired the bitcoin?  Who's to say I didn't buy the bitcoin when it was 1100 per.  So it would be a loss of 100 instead of a gain of 900?

Make an email filter to direct incoming mail from their domain to the spam folder.

But only if you sell it.  if you just keep it and spend it, there is no gain.  Just because I own a classic car and it appreciates in value doesn't mean i owe capital gains tax. Right?

Why can't you get a hardware wallet and move your money to it?
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:02:03
If it aint global and untethered it aint shit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:41
Oh, you're stuck because you didn't get your money off before the fork?  That sucks.  Sorry bro.
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:49:03
Sweet..so i don't need a licence to sell it then?

Someone wants to be Obi Wan.

I see one in the same here.  Not prosecuting is criminal conspiracy.  
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:37:11
Someone arrest this dickbag.

I came to the thread to beg...But now I'm just waiting to see the response to his question.
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:28:57
I don't have much, but I know you're my people, and I am glad to see you all doing well and poised to enjoy the much deserved win.  Hodl on.

With a name like bitcoinsucksass you sure have a position...It's a lie, but it's a position.  ;)
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:18:52
So, did they just give suitcases of cash to already rich people?  I mean, I didn't get a stuffed envelope.  Anyone else?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:41:58
This is bitcoin man...we say buy the dip not trough.  ;)
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:26:37
Its like a game exploit.  If too many people know about the devs will patch it.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:31:49
We should embrace them and bring them up to speed.  We want BitCoin to go mainstream..so the flow of noobs will be great and ongoing.  Just have a canned response to the FAQ's ready.

Lower and middle income people are the driving force behind the rising use of bitcoin.  Fuck the Winklvoss twins.  I try to hook as many people as I can.  It all comes with just talking it out setting up a wallet for them on their phone and sending them a little.
@_date: 2015-11-06 15:16:50
Take a longer view.   zoom out to 30 years.  
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:49:50
Good.  Too many fucking millionaires already.

If she didn't know anything about it, I hope you educated her and got her on to it.  It would flourish in the industry I think.

Fake ass shit. His shoes are new, look how clean the bottoms are.  His clothes are spotless, he's not even leaning on the wall.  This is someone who didn't get in early trying to go viral and get dopes to send him some coin.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:37:50
VM FTW!

One of the main benefits of bitcoin is you are your own bank.  So having a third party hold your money for you is counter productive.  Coinbase answers to the Govt.  You don't.

Thank you.
