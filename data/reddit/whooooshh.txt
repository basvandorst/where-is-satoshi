agree with all of that except the gun part.  we have a gun *violence* problem.  canada has just as many guns per capita as america, with gun violence levels that are less than most european countries.


trying to blame america's failed drug prohibition on mexico is like a fat girl trying to blame macdonalds for her failed diet.

i disagree about quality and efficiency.

in some countries drugs are forbidden, and i think people are still able to acquire them.

ah no wonder you are so smug, you're european.  
my wife was robbed at gunpoint in the netherlands, where guns are "illegal".  so i don't buy
