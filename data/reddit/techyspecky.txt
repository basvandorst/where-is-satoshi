they do have permission, it's called the law. It's not theft, if it was theft go report it to the police.
They do not need your permission.
Do you need a terrorists permission to shoot him?
Do you need a convicts permission to jail him?
What are you talking about?
Who do you think you are that the government needs your permission. They LET you live here, they GIVE you the god damn right to exist. Thank them and move on. You have your basic rights, they have theirs.
No  one needs to ask you shit to take 30% of your wages.

how is it theft? Do you not want schools? water? infrastructure? security? 
It's funny how the same people calling it theft want the government to erect expensive walls and stop illegals from coming in. Where'd you think that money would come from?

And how do you suggest governments operate?
How do they fund: Schools, Military, Police, Healthcare, Energy, Economy, Politics, Roads and other infrastructure?
I believe there are places with no  governments currently operating in jungles etc if thats what you prefer.
But a modern society with roads and cars cannot exist without a government. Which can in turn not exist without money.

it's called tax. pay it.

Because they need the money. If you believe, which I do too, that corps/churches should be taxed, then vote for the right people.

wut? If you are hiding mid-6 digits you could be on their radar.

Think of it that way, tax is theft if you count walking on a road as trespassing.

it's called auditing.

they can easily track your spending genius

it's not. It's in the law. It's fully voluntary, if you don't like it, leave.
The same way, its involuntary that you have to drive on a specific side of the road. It's there for a reason.
If you don't like it, leave.

The only people who I've heard saying that taxes are theft are over at the donald subreddit.
Can you please explain how the government using your money to fund the entire country is theft? I just want to see what your thought process is.

I had gift cards on amazon in the US, I don't live in the US and don't need anything from the US. Was looking for a way to convert my US gift cards into UK cash.
