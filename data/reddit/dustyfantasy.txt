I asked about this a few days ago and the messages I received indicated that ledger will still work with nano S. You just have to send it to the BitPay wallet first, I believe. However, don't just take my word for it and if you find out more correct information, please post it for the rest of us.

Thank you! I know it seems like a silly question. Just from a non-technical persons perspective, SegWit -&gt; base seemed like it could be different things haha. I appreciate the info a lot
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:35:13
Thanks to you and everyone else for the replies.. And thanks for the tip though I don't know how to accept.. Yea I thought that was weird, Bcs I put my hash per sec into ambit lite coin  calc and it said I was getting like 22 a day.. Wayyy to good to be true IMO 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:16:32
So to anyone who was wondering, I guess I set up my batch file incorrectly.. I'm only getting 12 kh/s which equals out to about .11 litecoins a month.. Or 1.2 a year.. Honestly I'm not even mad.. It took like 6 hours, im tired as hell, and I have class in 6 hours but damn was that fun.. Thanks again everyone and sorry for unintentionally posting in the wrong place
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:40:47

@_date: 2014-02-26 09:07:01
Literally just read the newcomer sticky and cringed when I saw the If the mods or whomever want to delete this, they would be welcome to, sorry again.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:44:16

@_date: 2014-02-26 09:07:46
Oh don't tease me haha, I'm too tired x)

Okay, I'm new and you guys just stopped me from buying more bitcoin at the ATM near me. I am a newbie, I actually just had a post recently where I even said with the OP said ready to invest. But I want to be in the long term, like that guy said I want to know what to read and how to learn so could you please direct me to where I could read more and not lose my money. I also would like to further the cryptocurrency adoption by the general public because then more people will gain money.
E: I've already started to read and research but I want to know if there are any specific articles, videos, books, or other forums where I can gain some valuable knowledge 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:42:35
First of all, thank you for directing me to the side bar, that is a great help. I do want to say that I understand your frustration. I haven't looked at your post history but I might check it out to see advice. 
Like any subreddit, hobby, or interest bitcoin seems to be going through another... boom? Bubble? Like 2013 I believe it was. New people will come to discuss and, hopefully, join in and be a benefit to whatever that may be. The people that are on here, are already on reddit, or have an interest in tech, the internet, etc.. What seems to be the best direction for bitcoin, and currencies in general is to be picked up by the "mainstream". Imagine trying to explain all this shit to someone who has no interest on computer parts, money they cant see, or any other number of things I can't think of at the moment. 
Knowledge is a tool that you can pass on. I do understand and I don't want to seem as if I'm being patronizing or preachy. The idea of even looking at the sidebar completely went over my head so I wanted to sincerely thank you for that. Just know that, from my new person perspective, it seems that there is a long road ahead even still.
E: However, I do only have around 40 dollars in bitcoin so the mainstream can hold on just a bit hahaha, waiting for prices to drop. As I've seen on here, "it crashes upward"
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:54:04
Time to see how it all turns out I guess. Good vibes all around.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:35:20
Thanks for the website! Just got back home and signed up.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:34:25
Good to know! After some rest I think I'm going to find a tutorial. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:35:30
Thanks for the reply. Still learning and it's great that the community seems to be active and helpful
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:31:16
That's what it is. Thank you for your reply. Gotta learn the terminology. Been looking at other currencies but.. just gonna invest in BTC as it seems to be like the Dow Jones haha.. that's probably really simplifying it and also pretty wrong. But again, thank you for the info 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:56:00
So it appears that the 11.4883 actually means .0114883 bitcoins. I didn't know that it could be like sig figs haha. Well it's a learning experience and this may help some poor soul whose learning the ropes like me. 
For search purposes: "only received part of bitcoin" , "Electrum received a part of transaction" , "why did only part of coins go to my wallet from another of mine". 
If none of this actually means anything and this is just an eyesore or something that will get lost in the stream and a mod wants to remove it, I won't have any hard feelings. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:30:35
Nice to see you did a write up. Actually kind of cool seeing people give constructive criticism even though I haven't learned a fraction of that much computer science 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:35:49
Thank you for your words. I appreciate them
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:40:46
I spent .03 of my .08 on something from an online retailer that only accepts crypto. As I wait for the package the guilt is eating away at me. I made money but possible future returns are making me so depressed at my decision. 
Payday is 6am on Friday so hopefully I'll be smart enough to buy dips and hold after that....
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:40:37
Honestly, I'm relatively new to crypto but god dammit if I don't read hodl as the beginning to hodor every time
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:12:40

Game of Thrones and crypto? I like it
*ON AN OPEN FIELD!!!!!*
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:48:19
Yup, just saw that the US is a nightmare for the cards due to legislation but Bitpay is exactly what I needed. Thank you so much, sincerely. I would have never thought to look for something like that. Just gotta wait until they're back in stock.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:01:24
Appreciate your info. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:02:36
Heard. Then I'll do more research and make a well informed decision. Maybe have two cards? Eh, time, learning, and maybe some spreadsheet math will help out haha
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:44:26
Cool! Thanks for the info. I'll definitely do some research into that. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:57:07
Some awesome information. Definitely going to come back to this later (just got off work  and smell like a kitchen). 
Would there be any relation of market cap to price? Or does this just tell us the amount of wealth *in fiat* that is currently tied to BTC. I was thinking of the market cap as the high of water in a pool. If people take it their money, a section or % of the water is removed and addition is just the opposite. That the more "water" is in the pool, the higher the value. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:38:30
Short, sweet, and to the point. Thanks! Didn't even know about a bitcoin debit card, so I'll look into that.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:44:52
Your comment was really valuable. Got me to look outside "the box" or sphere of influence I'm used to. Under the ground and all around, there are people trading value. 
Also, just heard about spoofing earlier today. It's sad that I rely so heavily on this subreddit for info. Memes, jabs at forks, unintelligible.. only what I can describe as virtual screaming. I think your comment brought me back down to earth and.. I don't know why but the word brevity fits into there somehow. Anyways, thank you. I appreciate the info.
