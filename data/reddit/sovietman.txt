litecoin is not a fork since it didn't fork from the original blockchain, afaik.
it's called an Altcoin, alternative coin.
however, please correct me if I'm wrong.

one of the reasons for the resistance against bigger blocks was that it would speed up centralization of the backbone of the network, but since the blockchain grows in size every 10 minutes no matter what limit is put on, it's gonna be more centralized anyways, and it's fucking HUGE by now. hell, even just the BOOTSTRAP files shared around on torrents are fucking huge.
it's also has WAY too much hash power behind it, so there's NO WAY for normal people to mine without joining centralized pools with expensive specialized equipment.
but yeah, LTC is 4x faster is because the time between blocks is shorter.
I am not exactly sure on why the debate was never about moving to 5 minute blocks instead of making the blocks bigger.
having faster confirmation time is good for smaller businesses if they really can't trust 0-confirmation transactions, but that's not really good for POS purchases like in a coffee shop or when buying groceries and having to wait at the register or somewhere for the transaction to be confirmed, that is if they REALLY can't trust 0-confirms, which would be weird in my opinion since that's what normal VISA transactions are anyways. it's normally not until the end of day or even few days later in some cases the actual transaction is finalized. hell, people don't even get the money until either the 1st or 15th of a month. can't remember which.

It's not technically Illegal in Iceland last time I checked.
Just really hard to use/buy and no guarantees from banks or by out central bank. Nothing stopping mercs to accept them.

Most if not all bitcoin wallet apps have an exchange rate window. Ofcourse it is only an estimate. There are plenty of websites that show more up to date or even live info.
Will insert links later if I don't forget.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:29:41
there is. this is just the DEFAULT. miners can decide to include only transactions with 10BTC fees if they REALLY wanted to. 
Of course, that would mean they would process no transactions and could not effectively mine.
Some of them don't include 'free' transactions(those who are under 1KB in size).
This is why free transactions sometimes takes longer to confirm.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:58:42
well, they can decide to not convert a certain % amount od the bitcoins they receive, iirc.
would be cool of them to keep like 2-5% in bitcoin

now you have some dogecoins as well.

All transactions are traceable(to each other), but it is all anonymous.
If you don't want everyone to see your whole balance, use a new address for every or every few transactions.
Message me(or reply here) if you have any follow up questions :)

Ah I see. Haven't used the android version for a long time. I thought they had already added it. I guess not.

So what's the tl;dr version of SegWit vs BU?
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:04:01
Solo mining is impossible. The difficulty and total hash rate is way too high and has been for quite some time
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:16:08
Iirc your wallet.dat file contains your private key so it is often recommend you encrypt it.
Then it is also a good idea to store a written version of your key somewhere safe so you can recover your funds if something happens to your computer.
A popular way to do that is to make a paper wallet version
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:59:26
Wow... that sucks :c
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:00:53
Difficulty doesn't rise because of the supply, it rises because of the higher total hashrate.
It is just the reward that lowers over time

Just transactions between addresses basically, added with some hashing. There are LOADS of youtube videos that can give you more details of you want :)

Confirming transactions basically. That's it.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:11:38
If so, I will contact ISNIC about this!

Holy fuck, that's a lot of derivatives!
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:13:16
Just one error. Transferring coins take few seconds.
It's the confirmation of it that takes 10 minutes, which is udually only required with BIG or important transfers like to an exchange or something like that.
@_date: 2016-09-03 21:01:01
It's Icelandic not Islandic

Devaluation/bubble bursting is not inflation.
Lets at least use the right terms.

Is the bot even monitoring this sub? Cuz I don't see the usual message from the bot that offers a link to be reminded as well(without adding more RemindMe comments)

The difficulty has risen too much for GPU mining to be profitable. Just put coins in a jar and start buying small amounts when you see a good opportunity to do so. It is not much but it is certainly more than you would get from mining with GPUs :3

Will being an Icelandic citizen cause any complications?

the point of this experiment is to find out how hard it is to live on bitcoins by doing business with those who accept bitcoin. by using a service to go around that to buy stuff who DON'T accept bitcoin, that would be cheating :p
@_date: 2013-09-18 01:44:59
this 'input' stuff has always confused me. how does the wallet choose from what inputs to spend the money from? and why does it matter ?
edit: does this mean all those small transactions he got disappear into fees of the transaction he spends the bitcoins in? poor Phil :P
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:46:18
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:28:23
Yeah, just read that part in the FAQ. Kinda sucks no places trust CCs and PP to buy bitcoin, since bank transfers out of the country are banned for now :(
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:49:23
10(inputs)x5(some unit like a whole bitcoin) vs 1 (input) x 50 (unit)
Bigger transaction in kilobytes vs smaller.
It's basically just difference of how much information you need to put into the blockchain for the transaction to go through.
Compare it to asking a bank teller that you want to transfer 5 dollars to 10 different people or 50 dollars to one person and the bank had to charge per transaction
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:22:41
Yeah, Icelandic is a germanic language

well we already have ATMs that convert cash to Bitcoins. We can probably spread them around like normal ATMs and/or make something better.

@_date: 2013-11-25 08:09:01
I recommend you release this under CC or something :3 since you are already giving commercial use, might as well get the legal protections with it.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:17:25
So will it charge the card and convert it into bitcoins at market rate? Or am i misunderstanding this and its using only btc? Cuz I haven't found a way to buy btc :(

any interest in a dude from Iceland? always wanted to check out other countries
@_date: 2013-05-20 03:46:32
transaction fees need to get cheaper in my opinion. I have zero ways to buy coins so the little I have is just disappearing into fees
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:39:01

hmm weird. then i guess you should ask her then :/

So far i have been unable to use either paypal or credit cards to buy bitcoins. Normal bank transfers are not allowed. We are under a currency lockdown since the 2008 crash. We can only buy normal fiat currency by showing plane tickets
