We absolutely understand your point of view. We're not doing business through Coinbase/Bitpay and will be definitely looking for a direct solution. It is that just in the beginning every small business needs to look for support until it can stand on its feet. Thank you for sharing all this info, we love crypto as much as you do and will strive to stay as close as possible to the true intention of it. All the links you sent are much appreciated!
