There could be not only mining profits.

Also I'm thinking about some other tools to automate payments.
Like yahoo pipes, but for bitcoins. How do you think, will it be useful ? What are the usecases could be ?

Nice, I've started similar service about a month ago. Checkout [coinsplit](

Hi I wrote this service to split my bitcoin mining profits with friends.
You can take a look at real life [example]( where we share profits from mining on eligius pool.
Schemes also could be private, so you don't need to show your addresses to whole world, but it could be useful.
Currently it's free. We only charge 0.0001 for Bitcoin fee.
Default payments threshold is 0.01, but you can customize it.
I hope this tool will be useful for Group buy admins. It will allows them to provide transparency and instant payments.
If you have doubts, checkout [testnet.coinsplit.io]( this mirror works with bitcoin testnet.
Please take a look and give me some response, thanks.
