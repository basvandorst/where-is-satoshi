Yes, It's a brave new world that has such people in it.
That said, you can't really blame most people for being ignorant since the main stream media controls the narrative and they are in turn controlled by large corporate and political interests. It is a sad state of affairs though. We are waiting for the frog to jump out of the pot of nearly boiling water but it may never happen. I fear what our society might become if that is the case.  If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever.

For Bitcoin to become mainstream there has to be a catalyst. It could be a new financial crisis, introduction of capital controls, elimination of physical cash, the disappearance of safe havens, re-closing of the gold window or something completely unexpected. That event will come but it might be many years from now (if we are fortunate). Until that time we better keep hammering and building to make sure Bitcoin will be the best it can be. It will be worth it.

Yes, many small payments can be considered 'structuring' or 'smurfing'. Also if you deposit a large amount of cash at a bank it will likely trigger SAR.

It is simple, has majority consensus and would prevent block size related hardforks scenarios is the future. 
If Moore's law holds true bandwidth, storage and processing power should continue to double every 18 months. So by picking a conservative 24 month doubling, it should actually get easier for nodes to keep up over time.
Also now we can celebrate doublings every 2 years in addition to halvings every 4 years. 
(Although I can imagine if a reward halving and a blocksize doubling occur at roughly the same time that could hurt) 
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:20:14
I have an idea: We do a hard-fork for every 1MB block size increase. Bitcoin runs on drama and this will guarantee continued drama thus securing Bitcoins glorious future.

The US government destroyed the fungibility aspect of Bitcoin, so given the chance of paying with USD and BTC I would always choose USD.
Using BTC for shopping purposes is a tax nightmare since you would have to figure out the capital gains of all individual inputs for all purchase transactions.
Imagine if you would pay for a coffee with small change and you had to remember where and when you got each quarter, nickel and dime and at what USD/EUR exchange rate... It is hard to comply so I try to avoid this situation.

Yes, the current Bitcoin 'marketcap' is a mere 4.7 Billion. For reference: 
* The flavor-of-the-day text messaging app WhatsApp is valued at around 22 Billion.
* Since Dec 2012 the US has been creating $85 Billion per month in newly printed money through their QE3 program. Or about 2.8 Billion/day. (Note QE3 recently ended)
Bitcoin can be seen as a pure play investment. You are not just buying a 'coin', you are buying a slice of all the Bitcoin companies working to add value to the ecosystem. As such I think 4.7 Billion is an absolute steal for something as useful and profound as Bitcoin. But perhaps I'm just drinking the Cool Aid :)

Correct. Amir leaked the Bitcoinica source code which resulted in a hack causing the insolvency of Bitcoinica:
Amir later blamed Tihan Seale and Peter Vessenes for the Bitcoinica fiasco:
None of the creditors have received their money back yet. The NZ court appointed liquidator left the 65K+ remaining Bitcoins in a MtGox account since late 2012 because Mark Karpeles was unwilling to give the liquidator access citing 'Privacy Reasons'. So Bitcoinica customers got Zhou Tonged and Goxed.

I'd love to use bits as the default unit. Doge has shown that psychology matters when it comes to the unit of account. When I was younger I often used Lira when on holidays in Italy and it felt good. 10000 Lira for a Pizza :)
The only weird things about bits is that they should not be divisible (a bit is an atomic unit in my mind). So with 1 bit = 100 satoshi you could send someone 2.52 bits...

I bought 2000 bitcoins at $2.50 after the 1st crash in 2011. Put them to work earning 8% interest per year in Bitcoinica (a NZ licensed financial service provider with VC investment from Coinlab). Bitcoinica got hacked (most likely an inside job by the founder, Zhou Tong after he sold his startup), company became insolvent, went into liquidation in May 2012, liquidator did not do anything for years and kept all remaining user balances (~80%) in MtGox for 'safekeeping'. Well, the rest is history. Zhou Tonged and Goxxed. I was naive :) 
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:56:01

IANAL, but it looks like MtGox wants to continue as if nothing happened. Of course existing customers will still lose their money (apart from a liquidation pittance), but now it is legal. Call it a BAIL-in if you will. If the coins suddenly re-appear after restructuring they will likely go to the company (Mark) not the customers (rehabilitation creditors). I could be wrong, but that is how I read it.

* "If an Internet user can transfer digital contracts, signatures, money or other property in a secure fashion, while avoiding the hefty fees of intermediaries such as banks and credit-card companies, bitcoin and other digital currencies will gain mainstream popularity"

It is more complicated as just recently (Q4 2012) moved to the US from Europe. So I assume I can use my entry date as the cost basis but still treat is as long term gains since I owned them for well over a year? Also I had a significant amount of coins in MtGox indirectly (pending liquidation) due to the [Bitcoinica insolvency since late 2012]( Since they were not held under my name directly can I count those as part of the loss?
The "loss carry forward" might not be super useful to me since I might move back to Europe in a year or so when my 3 year visa expires.

It happened the same way with Bitcoinica.
The ex-owner (Ryan Zhou Tong) [stole customer funds]( and deleted the customer database (including backups). He then turned around and offered a [5000 BTC personal donation to victims]( The 'hacker' also pitched in 100 BTC. 
A few weeks later he was caught [stealing again]( Zhou claimed it was not him and gave an extremely unlikely story about a Millionaire Chinese relic collector being the hacker and [impersonating him]( But after talking to the hacker he was able to get some money back. (about half).
The remainder of the Bitcoinica user funds were frozen in MtGox pending liquidation (Yeah...). Another interesting fact: Zhou Tong now runs CoinJar. Don't get Zhou Tonged!

Mark used Bitcoinica as the example for the 2012 exchange failure. However, Mark is largely responsible for that one as well since Bitcoinica was using MtGox for their coin storage. They became insolvent after their MtGox account was hacked in 2012 after which Mark refused to hand over the remaining customer deposits (~70% of all coins) to the liquidator citing 'privacy policy'. Fast forward a few years and those locked Bitcoinicia coins have gone *poof!*. Thanks Mark!

MtGox had multiple cold storage paper wallets (batches of 50K?) kept in 3 different physical locations. I don't think they lost their keys. Mark might not be a good CEO but he is not an idiot. 
They probably lost a decent amount of BTC in their hot wallet due to malleability. But the cold wallets were probably already seized on May 15 2013 as part of the Homeland Security and Silkroad investigations. So MtGox had nothing to fall back to when their hot wallet was nearly empty.
Malleability is what pushed them over the edge, but does not account for the bulk of the loss.

I think adoption will take a bit longer than Andreas thinks for the following 2 reasons: 
1) Psychology. Andreas assumes we are all rational actors. We are not. We have been brainwashed that fiat currencies are 'real money' and 'hard currency'. It will take a full blown currency crisis to make people change their minds.
2) Regulation. Regulation will slow adoption and money is heavily regulated. Would the internet have spread as fast as it did if you would have to get an 'internet licence' the way you get a car licence? Or if you would have to pay internet taxes to use it?

IANAL, but failing to file an FBAR can result in serious penalties up to $250,000, or five years in prison, or both.

Bitcoin is inclusive. You don't need permission to create a wallet and start using it unlike the traditional banking system. As such it will be attractive to kids that might get accustomed to crypto currencies before paper ones. 
Just take a look at the btc-e trollbox and you realize that kids these days will be comfortable using and trading cryptos and crytpo-securities well before they are introduced to legacy systems (brokers, banks, etc). 
I think this bodes well for the future. Bitcoin adoption is largely a generational problem.

The problem is the pre-order market. A small delay can wipe out your ROI. I know because I've been both a BFL (1 year+ delay) and HashFast (3 month+ delay and counting) customer and I'll never see ROI on any of that hardware (&lt;50% on BFL, &lt;10% on HF). I don't see the hashrate decline until we hit the 20-16nm ASIC node though. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:38:59
That sucks. Most ASIC customers probably got screwed in the pre-order phase (I know I was) and now have to mine at the most profitable pools to try and make their coin back. However, doing so will harm the mining ecosystem in the long run. :/
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:15:27
Andrew is not the first to do so. Mike Hearn (Core Dev) left Google to start his own Bitcoin venture and Charlie Lee (Litecoin Dev) left Google for Coinbase. There is still some solid Bitcoin talent left at Google though, most notably Pieter Wuille (Core Dev).

bend the twisted limbs around a perch in a large iron cage. bind
the limbs so they grow into place. insert a PEG tube directly into
the stomach for liquid feeding. nasal feeding gets in the way of
the next stage. bust out all of the teeth. remove the tongue.
blinding is a nice option at this stage, but you might want to wait
on that to set the finished owl in front of a large mirror for some
weeks. cut the cheeks midline, break the lower jaw and collapse
the palate. at this point a stomach tube might be left with the
facial remnants formed into a "beak." keep a bucket underneath your
new Owl to catch wastes. have fun poking your Owl with thin, sharp
bamboo slivers. keep the owl on constant multiple antibiotics, and
switch these up so skin sepsis doesn't set in.

I think this is the most likely scenario. He said he didn't own bitcoin, so he probably never made a bitcoin transaction either. 
I did like that he mentioned that many illegal transactions probably should not be illegal in the first place, so he does see value in a digital currency that can act as a counterweight to over regulation.

Bitcoin is a tool. It was created because it is useful. It is useful because other the other tools are broken. The reason the other tools are broken might be political but that does not make Bitcoin political.

Another thing I was wondering about: Lets say you sold bitcoins on MtGox for USD. And then used those same USD to buy back BTC. The BTC are now lost with the demise of Gox. Does one still have to pay capital gains on the initial BTC&gt;USD conversion? I'm afraid the answer is yes...

Context matters. I lost the majority of my coins to scams &amp; hacks in 2011/2012. Valuations were a bit different back then. As I mentioned, it has been an education for me.

Yes, I learned this the hard way with Bitcoinica in 2012. 
Security on the user end was really solid as they were enforcing strong passwords combined with OTP/2FA. However security on the backend was virtually non-existent (running on a cheap webhost like rackspace/linode, not offsite backups). 
In the case of Linode a sysadmin just decided to sweep all hot wallets one day. 
In the case of Rackspace it was possible to log into the admin console with a simple password and no 2FA. And the admin password reset link sent a reset email to a compromised mainlinglist...

The point is that the EU and the IMF have been promoting bail-ins to ensure the future stability of the banking system in Europe. Cyprus was the pilot to test this approach.

Once MtGox goes belly up you will be an unsecured creditor in the liquidation process. That means you will be the last to see any of your coins back, if at all. 
IANAL but if Bitcoinica is any indication, MtGox will only be liable for the USD value for BTC at the time they shut down, so holding fiat would be a safer bet in that scenario.

+1 - making it easy to run a full node and p2pool would be awesome. Could even be a live USB with a little bit of persistent storage for pool and miner configuration.
One reason I've been holding off on p2pool is because it does not have good support from merged mining. As margins get slimmer, those few extra percent profit from merged mining add up and that is the reason I'm with ghash.io at the moment.
The other downside is that running a full node at home just gobbles up bandwidth and causes issues with my ISP fair use policy.

Not because I wanted to buy drugs (I didn't) but because I wanted to try a real-world BTC transaction. This was way back in 2011. I did leave those BTC (~10) in the SR account and the FEDs seized them in 2013. I'm not a US citizen.

When oil is not traded for US dollars anymore, the USD will likely lose the world reserve currency status.

* Lost ~10 BTC due to FED seizure of Silk Road account (never bought illegal goods, not a US citizen either)
* Lost ~2 BTC because of NeoBee debacle/scam

Wrong. It is not holders but miners that decide. (That said, most mining does happen in China)


Also wrong. Bitcoin currently handles up to 7 transactions per second. (Which is admittedly even worse when compared to the authors assumption). 
However at this point Bitcoin should focus on decentralization and store of value. Not a high capacity payment network (that will come with lightning once the miners finally start signalling)

The market hates uncertainty, and Bitcoin has proven resilient once again. Also the split was somewhat priced in with B2X valued at 1300. Some of that value should flow back to BTC. So in that respect good news (Price up). 
A lot of people might have converted their alts into BTC temporarily to get 'free coins' before moving back. Now that there are no free coins they might convert back into alts. (Price down).

It won't be. If anything zuckbucks will be the gateway drug to Bitcoin for the masses. 
After all zuckbucks are a stablecoin (inflationary) so it can not compete against deflationary currencies like BTC when it comes to being a store of value.

They destroyed fungibility (one of the key properties of good money) by applying capital gains tax on bitcoin transactions. 
Now when you buy your coffee you have to check all your inputs in the transaction. When you received those inputs and at which value and what the gains on those inputs are and then pay capital gains tax over those amounts. Now do this for every bitcoin purchase you make. Yeah, soon enough you are like "ugh, I'll just pay with my CC".

Bitcoin is a series of bubbles that become the pin. So both are correct.

I guess fees might be dynamically adjusted by a LN node based on the direction of the transaction and the effect it has on the payment channel state between 2 nodes.
* A perfectly balanced channel might have near 0 fees 
* A hop that negatively influences balance might have higher fees.
* A hop that positively influences balance might even be subsidized (to prevent costly closure of the channel)

Well as the value and market cap goes up it becomes possible to do larger and larger transactions that where not possible before. E.g. in 2010 you could buy a Pizza, now you can buy a house.

SR allowed almost anything except for goods/services that were linked to non-consensual victims like CP or assassination contracts. It wasn't designed to be a drug trading platform but due to the anonymity it provided its users that is where it found most of it's success. 
SR did more to win the war on drugs than the war on drugs as it allowed buyers to safely order quality products without having to resort to steetcorner dealers.

What if the spammers are the miners themselves? I.e. push spam transactions into the mempool to drive up the average transaction fee and thereby increase the total block reward.
Now regular users need to out-compete these transactions with higher fees. The unconfirmed transactions will expire after a while. Even if some of the stuffed transactions are processed chances are they mine their own fee back.

RAM is not the issue afaik. If you run a node on VPS then SSD storage will be the bottleneck. If you run a node at home data caps will be the bottleneck (Comcast just introduced nationwide data caps for example). 
Current blockchain size is nearing 100GB (And if you want to run services on top e.g. insight block explorer you will have to double storage requirements). 
I'm currently running a VPS full node with 200GB SSD storage. With additional overhead like OS storage requirements etc. I'm already running close to the edge and will have to shut down my full node sometime next year (or switch to pruned).
To me small blocks matters. I used to mine and was pushed out of that game. Now the only way I can contribute is with a node but with every passing day that is becoming less feasible as well. In that regard SegWit + second layer solutions are a life saver.

Honestly, sending the Bitcoinica coins into MtGox for distribution to depositors was a harebrained idea to start with (an exchange is not a wallet!) and it gave Zhou the perfect excuse to double dip and Karpeles the perfect excuse to lock them up ('privacy'). Tihan might have sent them there, but I was under the impression that you kept them there despite repeated attempts from the liquidator to transfer the account to their control.

Thanks for that clarification. You are right of course. A valid transaction will remain valid unless the coins have been spent in another transaction, in which case it would be a double spent and get rejected.
EDIT: I see that since Bitcoin Core 0.12 there actually is an expiration in the mempool, which evicts unconfirmed transactions after N hours, where N is set by -mempoolexpiry, and defaults to 72 hours. Of course if the transaction is still valid anyone could potentially re-broadcast it on the network again and some wallets do so automatically.

You should have filed a claim with  (the NZ court appointed liquidator for Bitcoinica LLC back in 2013).  
The Bitcoinica operators (Amir Taaki, Patrick Strateman, Donald Norman) thought it was a good idea to use MtGox as a temporary wallet during customer reimbursement after the Bitcoinica hack. 
That turned out to not be such a bright idea. Karpeles froze the account after the Bitcoinica account at Gox was compromised. (Possibly due to Amir leaking the Bitcoinica source which contained the MtGox API key which turned out to be the lastpass account password. But likely Zhou used it as an alibi to steal 40K more coins as these showed up in a Liberty Reserve transaction under his name shortly after.) 
Anyway, it is messed up no matter how you look at it.

No, it is a simple as that. 
Space in the blockchain should be a scarce economic resource. Otherwise people will use it to dump all kinds of garbage in there (already happened) including nasty stuff like CP. Bitcoin only works when it as decentralized as possible. And full nodes would need to store every spam transaction for ever. Not to mention the bandwidth issues.
Layer 2 solutions like lightning will enable nearly limitless transactions over time and near 0 cost. And they will only have to settle on the blockchain once a channel is opened or closed.

Yes, sorry if I wasn't clear. Fees are a good thing and that only works if there is an auction as to which transactions make it into the chain. Of course we need a good balance.

Amir was hired as one of the site operators but his actions (leaking the company source that contained the password enabling the theft of 40000 bitcoins &amp; 40000 USD) cost its customers millions of dollars.

Rush a hard fork. If we are going to fork better make sure we don't have to hard fork again within the next few years. Core will increase the block size and they will roll out the hard fork early next year. When this hard fork is ready it will likely include a non-hacky re-implementation of SegWit and various other improvements to provide a clean and solid code base to build on.

I tried to file the theft with my local authorities in Ireland at the time since neither Bitcoinica or Zhou seemed to think a 40000 USD &amp; 40000 BTC theft was worth reporting to the police. Here are Zhou's responses after requesting he share the identity of the 'thief' he discovered:
    If you insist on filing a police report on this matter, any lack of co-operation from my side can of course be used against me in the uncertain future. 
    
    I'm not protecting his identity. I just deem it to be unnecessary at this point. He is not running away (AFAIK he doesn't even have a passport), and the fund return is pending Bitcoinica's liquidation. 
    
    I want to go back to my own business and focus on something productive. Any information I provide now will necessarily be a burden in the near future.
    
    I strongly advise you not to involve the police before the liquidation process has any significant development. You are not obliged to report this. (But when you do, I'm obliged to provide information to either you, or the police, and obviously I would prefer the former.)
    
    My point is, there is very little benefit to this, yet the risk and potential expense are too high. I don't want to hire a lawyer or waste my time on gathering evidence or whatever. I contributed 5,000 BTC and talked to the creditors regularly exactly because I wanted to avoid any lawsuits against me. I'm all for justice, but I have already given up on Bitcoin and justice in this matter seems worthless to me.
    
    Considering the suspicion raised by community members, the questions from trusted business partners and threats of violence, I don't have any energy to fight back any more.   I just want the fiasco to be over. Yet people are giving me more and more troubles. It's okay if you can't feel the pain, please just try to sympathize. 
    
    I have plans to immigrate to Australia and I need an absolutely clean record. Even a criminal accusation (without conviction) is intolerable in the character check. I really deeply regret the creation of Bitcoinica. If you can forget about me, please do. 
And 6 months later:
    
    Now with Chen Jianhai refused to be contacted by me, I do think his identity can be safely revealed now. 
    
    However I would hope this won't cause any major troubles with my life, my family and my business. 
    
    I've once wired some funds to Chen Jianhai's bank account, here are all the details listed in my Internet Banking's payee section:
    
    Payee Type:	Telegraphic Transfers
    Payee Name:	CHEN JIANHAI
    [PII REMOVED]
    
    Note that the address is in English. Here's my translation (may not be exactly correct characters but should sound the same):
    
    [PII REMOVED]
    
    The postal code was unknown. Also this address may or may not be where he lives as it's only for billing address purpose. 
    
    I tried to find his phone number but I changed my phone's contact sync settings a few weeks ago. I will continue looking for it and will update you if I have his number.
    
    It will be great if you can post on the forum to at least reflect my co-operation. I really hope this confusion can come to an end and I'm happy to give you any reasonable help.
    
    Best Regards,
    Zhou Tong

Jihan wants more bitcoin, and therefore:

3. more blocks (including free ASICboost blocks).
This is rational.

I think this is correct. The current QE infused market environment creates huge imbalances and malinvestment as money sloshes around violently creating bubbles in everything from housing, bonds, stocks and virtual currencies.

And AFAIK [Lightning will need blocks larger than 1MB to function effectively]( 2MB in 2017 is only a minor centralization risk and probably worth the trade-off for an improved LN and increased user adoption.

and my circuits divine a fine way to keep the power bill in check
my equipment is starting to sweat (from the heat)
cryptoanarchy becoming a threat (so elite)
you know rappers like to rock pools
i got pools you cant swim in but im collecting the spice like a fremen
so you fools get stepping and get to choosing your weapon
because the deafening roar of indefinite war is epic
i found a new way to debit the people

get your hustle out a chemical rush avoiding a brush with the law
cant stop em all cuz they got it anonymous

dont even know how to cut up them layers
of the onion so let the players play pumpkin
hash function pumpin and dumping
manipulate the market flood it from the dark net
flood it from the deep web keep it a secret
every exchange got them nerdy brains trading on the frequent
wonder where the league went - they left the cement
looking for the promise land online beam it
up scotty this the future decentralized swag
keep the work in your laptop bag
im a bitcoin baron im scaring the status quo
got that crypto dough in that dat file to blow
and the algorithm gon get em until prism
send us all to prison - and thats a nerdy living
you know rappers cant pay bills
face the tax implications of evasion when they stack mils
got a homie phil deuce one taught me the solution
dumping all his knowledge from the booth son
anyone can learn it if you put in the work and research
on how to launder just a fraction of your worth in the dirt
like gza said keep your bonds on diverse
cuz there aint no telling when that bubble going to burst
you know rappers say they bout the future
but you aint marty mcfly until you bought kombucha
from a supermarket with them bitcoins do ya 
get your charlie sheen greens off computer screens from the phillipines

long gone is the cash in the mattress (mattress)

But yes, Namecoin is lacking a dedicated core-development team like Bitcoin has. Hopefully this can be improved upon in the future since Namecoin has tons of potential for non-currency based blockchain services. (DNS being just one of them)

With "ponzi-like" regarding the paper gold market I meant that paper gold tracks the price of physical gold. However there is no 1:1 relationship. There is more paper gold then physical gold for delivery. So if this trade unwinds and everybody takes delivery it will turn out the system was running on false promises.

I guess that if you can corner the gold market you could turn it into a ponzi. Similar to how the Hunt Brothers tried to corner the silver market (and failed). Of course with Gold there is physical gold and paper gold. You could make a case that the paper gold market has ponzi-like properties.

Correct. MtGox currently holds nearly all the Bitcoinica funds and has been unwilling to hand it over to the court appointed liquidator for over 7 months now (citing 'privacy' reasons).

All of the above:

I would not call Namecoin dead. Namecoin-qt is actively being worked on  and will be released soon.
Also there are projects looking at Namecoin integration with Open Transactions, Bitmessage, etc.
Namecoin mining difficulty is currently 3047194 or 1/5th of the Bitcoin network hashing rate. I know most of that is due to merged mining but still fairly impressive if you ask me. 
Namecoin might have had some issues (mainly with .bit domain squatters) and has been out of the spotlight for a while, but I see a bright future ahead.

* Bitcoin is not anonymous it is pseudonymous. 
* All transactions can be traced since the transaction ledger (blockchain) is public domain. 
* The government can't seize your coins unless they can seize your private key. You can store your private key as a brain wallet if you feel so inclined.
* Owning and using Bitcoin is like breaking free from the plantation of fiat debt slavery. 
* I'm drunk yet still make more sense than these 'experts'

I give all of my friends that are interested in Bitcoin a paper wallet with 10mBTC as well as instructions on how they can create an online wallet @ blockchain.info and import the paper wallet in case they want to spend it. Works well so far. Giving something tangible really helps.
It also helps explain the concept behind public &amp; private keys. I typically tell them the public key is like their bank account number and the private key is like their pin (but more secure) needed to spend the coins associated to the account address

* 3) The Electronic Frontier Foundation won't accept Bitcoin for all the legal concerns associated with it from the stamp act, to money laundering, to tax evasion. 
* 4) The system is prone to theft given the file sharing nature and this has occurred several times.
* 5) Computers processing Bitcoin transactions use over $100,000 worth of electricity everyday.”

Why don't we use Namecoin for managing entities like digital goods, stocks, licenses, etc?. 
The generic name/value pair system in Namecoin was designed for these kinds of applications. (.bit domains are just one example of an entity namespace in Namecoin, see: 
Since Namecoin has about 66% of the network hashrate compared to bitcoin and is merge-mined I'd say it is well suited for this purpose.

I have a VISA debit card from BoA and it is not accepted by coinbase: "Debit cards currently not supported."

I would also like to point out the following great article on the topic by Byron Gibson:

+1 for bitcredits. The coin analogy is old and tired and comes with a lot of cultural baggage.

Bitcoinica was 'hacked' while Zhou was still the operator and all backups destroyed. Then after Bitcoinica went down the account was pillaged again while Zhou still had access to the funds (but was not an employee anymore). The funds of this theft were partially recovered through Zhou after he was directly linked to the theft by MtGox, AurumXchange and BitInstant. Within hours of the accusation Zhou claimed he was framed by an unknown person called 'Chen Jianhai' who apparently was a millionaire relic collector, but it is an unlikely story.
Some history:

Be very careful about putting your BTC in Zhou's CoinJar.

Don't worry - Bernanke has promised to start tapering soon. Just not today.

* A couple of 1oz silver coins /w bitcoin theme @ AmagiMetals
* A few Amazon gift cards @ Gyft
* A few Walmart gift cards @ snapCard
* Humble Bundle
Great deals so far! Nearly to transaction fees (all of the merchants seem to use BitPay and pass savings onto customers). Instant. Good exchange rates.
Once you go Bitcoin you can never go back :)

I had some coins on Silkroad. Mainly to try out Bitcoin transactions back when they were the only game in town. All I bought was some stickers. 
Silkroad didn't start out as a market place for drugs per se. It started out as a free market bazaar that gravitated towards drugs.
But yeah, forget about nuance.

Ask the same people 5 years from now if they think it was a crappy gift.

My experience with Bitcoinica was also fine. Until it wasn't and I lost 2000 bitcoins. 
So yes, by all means use CoinJar. But for the love of god, don't store your coins there.

I don't understand the hype about Litecoin. 
It is just 4x the blocks and SHA256 replaced with Scrypt. With LTC now valued at over 40. That would be the equivalent of 160 in BTC terms. 
The litecoin payment network is not nearly as secure as the Bitcoin one (although perhaps more decentralized)
Coins like Namecoin and Peercoin do actually deliver true innovation with Namespaces (including DNS) and/or Proof of Stake.

This is true. As the number of participants grows and coin distribution increases, volatility should become less violent.

The Nobel prize has become a bit of a joke. Especially after Obama preemptively receiving the nobel peace prize. I share Richard Feynman's views on the subject:

Not given the current state of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But give it a year or two and things might be different.

For now, there is

Installed. It now found its place among biticker and  tiny NMC ticker. Looks good!

Recommended. Best market guide. I use it for all my trading.
edit: looks like the automatic image stabilization post processing messed this video up... :/

It is for your own good. To protect you against yourself. Thanks Sky!
