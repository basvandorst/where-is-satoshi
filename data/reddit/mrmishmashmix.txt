I think the author is just trying to be pragmatic about the situation. Having one of the largest bitcoin exchanges just 'go away' is unlikely to be a bullish event for the price. 
I'm not a fan of any of the large exchanges, but they do have a role to play in the ecosystem. This sounds to me more of a 'bail-in' than a 'bail-out', which is definitely fairer in my opinion. Least that's the way I see it.

Well if that's the case its unlikely (though not impossible) to be the electrum bug, spectre or meltdown since they all depend on your computer being on (and the electrum bug only affected wallets without passwords set). In fact pretty much any hacking attempt is going to need to go through that password either way........unless the attacker has access to the seed. That's the only reason why I think its most likely that the seed has been used to access these bitcoins. I take your point about the ether wallet seed not being touched on evernote and if it was next to this wallet seed I see exactly what you're getting at. Can you think of any other way you may have been compromised?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:00:26
I'm really trying but failing at the moment. Bitpie claims to support it but there is no 'import/sweep' private key option and bither doesn't seem to be able to help either.

Theyre called vanity addresses and it would be unusual for a hacker to use one of those. Also the 'hacker' has made no effort to tumble the coins yet. 
Edit: where do you keep your seed words? Are you sure they werent compromised? Its the natural conclusion if the coins were stolen when the pc (with hot wallet) was turned off when the coins moved. The fact that the coins have stayed still may also imply an unprofessional opportunist rather than a leet hacker.

If you ever want to work out the probability of it going x minutes between two blocks, feel free to use this calculator [here](
Set the population mean to 10 mins and then use right tail (X&gt;or equal) to 60. Gives a probability of 0.0025. So expect to wait an hour (or more) between two blocks roughly every 400 blocks (so every 3 or 4 days). I think 38 degrees came to a similar conclusion.

Ok so that sounds like good news about Evernote. But I'm still wondering if your computer was turned off when the coins moved - its an important question. 
If I was you I'd start checking to see if any of my email addresses have been pwned, ESPECIALLY if you reuse passwords. Or very similar passwords. Like you say, if they have cracked the aes password encryption they've probably done it using some of the passwords you use. Its not that hard given that most people just vary one to three characters in the passwords they create.

Lightning nodes make the system more decentralised as it introduces another actor/role in the system, which helps to separate the powers and keep them antagonistic and balanced. We now have miners, devs, exchanges, nodes, spv nodes, users and lightning nodes. Each group will argue their point of view which is healthy for the system. I like the antagonism too.

GDAX is a dollar exchange whereas Finex is USDT (the much hated tether). Hence the price is more expensive on finex because much of the market is selling tether for bitcoin and eth. This probably helps to explain eth's little rally in the last couple of days too.

Ok so from what I understand (I could be wrong, its happened many times before) you've got an encrypted version of your wallet (aes encryption or 'advanced encryption standard') and if it is a blockchain.info wallet then you can use this file and the password to import back into blockchain.info. Just rename the file 'wallet.aes.json' then you can use this file to access your old blockchain.info wallet (hopefully!). Check your old emails for wallet identifiers. 
If I am wrong about the blockchain.info wallet, then you can still access this using the christopher gurnec software available from github [here]( It sounds like you have some kind of password written down so maybe that's the key to unlocking the aes on your wallet? Give it a go, it can't hurt.

Well the first thing I'd say in response to your comment about the roads is that a shit road is definitely better than no road at all. 
I'm not as fussed about roads as I am with schools. You'll find pretty much every country in the world *that you'd want to live in* offers a free education. Its in everyone's interest to have a well educated work force, whether you're sitting at the top or the bottom of the pyramid. If I had to guess, I'd say you probably benefited from a tax payer funded education yourself (since the vast majority of people do - in my country private education runs at a rate of 7%)
But the good news for you my friend is that we already live in a world where many countries charge directly (rather than indirectly through taxes) for schooling. Here's a small snippet of the list of the places that do:
Ghana (households spend on average 87 dollars per year)
Ivory Coast (average spend 151 bucks)
El Salvador (average spend 680 dollars)
Take your pick. 
I do agree with you though that taxpayer funds are frequently wasted and more needs to be done to hold governments to account and also to localise (decentralise) the process.

Hey I'd never claim to be an expert when it comes to security either, but pretty much everything I've learnt has been from this reddit and the ubuntu forums - the only words of advice though that I'd like to finish with is firstly:
move whatever you had in your my ether wallet to a new wallet. Consider any seeds on that computer compromised. 
secondly: Don't store any seeds on any computers, keep them on paper stashed in two separate physical places. (Say the attic and the shed). You can be sly about it and just underline the seed words in a big book. Tell no one unless you really trust them. 
Finally: Keep any serious amounts of funds permanently offline. Set up a paper address wallet or use an old laptop or a raspberry pi or buy a ledger or trezor. But just keep it offline so not even the creator himself can access your stash. 
It sounds like you still have a fair old chunk of crypto so try not to feel too upset about it (It sounds like you've done a great job of this so far) even if it is a shit load of money! You mentioned your 2 year old daughter - I have a 3 year old girl and a new born boy - these will always be way more precious than some random private key. Health is the greatest wealth fella!

I'm not sure your first point carries much weight; if you're keeping wealth of any kind of magnitude in a bitcoin wallet and you're ignoring the (rather important) developments in the space - well you've only got yourself to blame if you lose your funds. 
I agree with your second point, in the short term it will effectively increase the inflation rate and is unlikely to be price positive. But you've got to bear in mind how much it would cost. The cost of mining and the price of bitcoins seem to have a strong correlation for obvious reasons, and I suspect that quantum computers will cost a few quid - in fact the price should adjust accordingly, if there is huge demand for them to crack old private keys. I suspect that the market will balance it all out in the end. So that's the bad news, but what about the good news? Well firstly we'll finally have closure with regard to Satoshi's coins and all the lost coins out there. No more ambiguity around whether Satoshi is going to come out of hiding and crash the market. Secondly computers will be far more advanced. The infrastructure will be massively improved on all fronts. I can't see how this could be anything but a positive for the network. 
Regarding your last point about there being no 'drop in' replacement for ECDSA, take a look at this [paper]( which suggests four different signature schemes to replace ECDSA with. I won't claim that it will be very easy to change and protect against this, but to say it would be difficult is also misleading. If we can survive the forks that we've been through already with the blocksize, we can survive this.

Firstly its worth pointing out im a total maverick when it comes to this stuff. My core node crashes every few weeks, im pretty sure it goes down because my ip address changes every few weeks.

Currency has three purposes. Store of value. Unit of account. Means of exchange. If the biggest crypto currencies are continuously rendered obsolete by the next technological advance, they can't fulfil the first (and perhaps most important?) function, store of value. Long story short, if alts succeed then crypto fails.

The way it works for a lot of tin pot exchanges is as follows. The exchanges themselves need to encourage traders so they need someone to 'make the market', so called market makers. In most cases this is the exchange itself or a company closely related to the exchange (see this coindesk [article]( In which case they see all of your orders and they know far more than you'll even know about that order book.

Ok so you successfully imported the .key file into your new multibit hd wallet. But your balance is incorrect because of a transaction on the 11th which you don't  believe you made.

I think its up to everyone as an individual how they would prefer to stash their private keys. If you like the ease of use of a trezor, fair enough. Maybe you prefer using an old computer, fresh linux OS and electrum to generate the wallet and write down the key. Maybe you're uber paranoid and you roll a dice to generate the randomness. Anyone who does any of the above (carefully) is almost certainly gonna be ok. My question to you would be what software are you using to generate the paper wallet? If its widely used and open source then once again, you'll probably be ok.

Don't worry. Almost everyone thinks that bitcoins are 'files' held on their computer when they start.

Quantum computing is often (mis)represented as 'the end of encryption'. But the reality is that encryption techniques have only ever improved as our powers to brute force grow stronger. We already have quantum resistant schemes that we could employ instead of ECDSA which wouldn't be difficult to replace. Maybe an industry will grow up around cracking the old private keys, kind of like a new mining gold rush - that's not a negative for bitcoin in the long run. The truth is it will push crypto's to use the latest....crypto and use longer keys to guard against attack.

But what has happened? We now work longer weeks and many of the agricultural and manufacturing jobs (which have indeed been automated) have been replaced with a huge number of jobs in the service, sales and managerial sector. There's some really interesting stuff written about this but I particularly like 'on the phenomenon of bullshit jobs' - [link here](

Ethereum has a lot to answer for when it comes to the bloated market caps of a thousand ICO coins with no real use case and very little transaction volume outside of the exchanges. But I agree with the general sentiment. I think Vitalik and many other eth devs are doing great work as well. The biggest problem is human greed and the desire to gamble. We need far wider adoption to justify current market caps - stocks suffer from exactly the same excesses though. I think we'll see the market caps shrink while usage goes up. Just like tech stocks circa 2000.

That's a reasonable point of view regarding the 145 million dollars. Its possible bitfinex is bidding up the price of bitcoin with tether. So take a look at the most recent rallies and investigate which exchanges led the rallies. From the evidence I've looked at, its mostly been action on Korean and Japanese exchanges where they have low or no trading fees and hence exaggerated volumes. As far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong) tether is mainly used in trex, polo, finex and huobi. So how could they use the tether to bid up the price on an exchange which doesn't take tether, unless they sold the tether for bitcoin first on these markets pushing down the price in the first place. As I understand it, it should be pretty obvious if what you say is happening is occurring as it would lead to an obvious spread between the exchanges, just as it did in Mt Gox.

Checking the balance is easy. Use the block explorers. Installing the client wallet and importing the key is more of a hassle, and you can really screw up if you haven't sent your real bitcoins to a new wallet first.

Multibit can be more than a tad awkward and its no longer supported, so you'd be well advised to move your coins to an alternative wallet (electrum maybe). If you have the .key file then you should be fine as that contains the private key.

No, you don't seem to understand. The original address posted was not an exchange address, unless its a very very early exchange address - there weren't really any exchanges in 2010. So I've checked the same address on both the standard and cash block explorers and just in the last two weeks, the funds have been moved. On the cash explorer, the funds seemed to have moved to an exchange address (i think!) but on the bitcoin explorer I'm not getting that impression. Could be a bch dump. That's my guess.

I know what you mean, but the fees are too high  for bitcoin to function as a payment network. Remember when we used to talk about micropayments too? I remember. Unless we get lightning network or side chains implemented and implemented quickly, it looks like we'll be giving up on payments and ceeding that market to one of our crypto competitors.

I'm just having trouble understanding the exact nature of the problem. You have two multbit wallets and both are reading a balance of zero yes? Or you made a transaction which you don't remember making? I'm really confused as to the exact nature of the problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:42:53
Your bitcoin exists on the shared ledger that the miners continually update. The only thing that gives you access to your bitcoin is your ownership of the private key. 
So in summary, bitcoins aren't 'files' kept on a machine. Whoever has the private key can spend those bitcoins. 
And yes thats why most of us like to keep our private keys permanently offline. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:45:22
Memorising the seed is definitely plausible.

If I was going to do this, I'd use cash trades slowly on localbitcoins selling it bit by bit. If its not that much, I doubt you have much to worry about. Other possibilities include running it through casinos or even reputable crypto lotteries where you just happen to buy all the tickets. The beauty of running it through a casino is you have some kind of proof of winnings. 
Pretty risky though - you could just pay the tax. Your call though :)

Hundreds of developers vs one developer. Also, If I want a blockchain with cheap transaction costs I'd use ltc, vtc, dgc, or a hundred other blockchains. I'm guessing, but I expect 80% of people with significant bitcoin holdings feel the same way. We'll never use bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:00:16
If the balance is correct, I'm sure there's no problem. I suspect this is what happened but please point out if its definitely not the case. You originally had some bitcoins (0.238?) but spent 0.0065 on a nice t-shirt or something, and you now have 0.231. But you're confused because the block explorer shows a transaction being sent to address 14wXpgPFWbJvDtatoSA9eeEUrFfeaEsHAN - and this isn't your original address. I think its just a change address which is still under your control, hence why the balance is showing correctly in the classic wallet. 
Going forward, I suggest you install electrum and send (don't import the keys - or your new seed won't cover the coins) the coins from multibit classic to electrum. Electrum is a great little wallet and multibit  has quite a few quirks which can confuse users. Hope this all makes sense. All the best.

There are no real exchanges in the UK thanks to the banking embargo on bitcoin exchanges here. The closest thing is coinfloor but you'll need to use sepa to transfer to their polish bank account. And if you're doing that, you might as well use bitstamp.

Depending on your level of paranoia, there are a variety of ways you can do this. I'd suggest:
(1) Get hold of a battered old laptop.
(2) Download any linux distro you like (do the checksum thing to make sure no one has fiddled with it).
(3) Create a bootable usb stick using whichever software you prefer (if you already use linux you can use gparted to do this - if you use windows then maybe rufus? lots of software to choose from to do this).
(4) Next you'll need to switch on the laptop with the usb stick in, and press f12 repeatedly or some other f key depending on the make and model of your laptop. Once your in the boot menu select 'boot from usb' and install linux.
(5) Download electrum for linux and move it across to the battered old laptop.
(6) Set up a new wallet. Save or write down the wallet address and the master public key.
(7) Use the master public key to set up the watch only electrum wallet on your online machine.
This is just a sketch of what you need to do but I promise you, its not too difficult and if I can do it anyone can. Screw hardware wallets. Old laptops/Raspberry pi's work just as well and the effort to learn how to set it up teaches you a lot about wallet security anyway.

As someone who has held for four years, I can tell you that four years ago people were screaming that the end was near - but for different reasons. 
There was the Ghash threat of the 51% attack. 
There was the ban from China (several times). 
There was a big fuss when Mt Gox collapsed with everyone's money. 
The bitfinex hack. 
I could go on. Each time the debate was framed as an existential threat to the very survival of bitcoin. Each time bitcoin crashed and then just kept on chugging along. Each time an altcoin was spoken about as the next bitcoin. 
The fee issue does suck but just imagine your going to buy gold - physical or paper, either way really. What do you imagine the fees are for this? They're pretty expensive. Gold somehow has managed to survive.

Yeah I think you're right there as I've just checked an old multibit.key file and mine has just one address. Perhaps the change addresses are derived from this. Let me look into this. In the meantime, can you confirm or disconfirm whether the balance in the old multibit classic wallet is incorrect.

Ahhhh gotya - sorry I should have realised the superscript upside down v is shift(6)! 
So lets take the first example. You know the 'stem' is 6yhn but could be this with shift pressed down and that this happens four times without spaces. Thats great because there's only 16 possibilities! So just type this in the token.txt file: Ive used **upsidedownv** as my representation of upside down v. 
6yhn %**upsidedownv**YHN
6yhn %**upsidedownv**YHN
6yhn %**upsidedownv**YHN
6yhn %**upsidedownv**YHN
You need the % sign because the upside down v is a special character, and the percentage sign tells the program not to treat it as such. Treat it as a normal character. This should try more than 16 combinations actually. 30 combinations as it tries all of them from 1 to 4 max. 
If you can be a bit more specific about the 'shape' of the password perhaps I can help you some more. Feel free to private message me. I'm no hacker but I quite enjoyed using this program. Its not your private key to your bitcoin wallet so it shouldn't really matter too much. Its the password to unencrypt the encrypted private key, which I hope you've kept completely to yourself :)

Ok so firstly note that a HD wallet has many addresses and private keys, all derived from the seed words which youve presumably written down. There are two types of addresses within this collection. Receiving addresses which you naturally use to receive coins. And change addresses - every time you send coins you actually send them all out - some to whoever youre paying then the rest goes into change addresses. 9/10 times when someone freaks out after checking a block explorer its because of misunderstandings with change addresses. Have you currently got the HD wallet installed? Is the balance showing correctly?

@_date: 2017-12-24 14:41:55
I'm not really any closer to understanding your motivations with that last snippet - all I can really gather is almost 2000btc have been broken into smaller and smaller amounts. My blockchain analysis skills aren't up to that much :)
edit: Ok so I've had a look at that address on both the bitcoin and cash explorers and it seems to me that the opposite is happening here (compared to the 10000btc address). I could be completely wrong (and I often am) but the impression I'm getting is someone with 1800btc was about the dump on the market so someone else with 10000btc was about to do exactly the same thing but with their bch. 
Disclaimer: Probably totally wrong.

Forget market cap. Its so misleading its reeeeediculous. I could work out the market cap for water by looking at the evian bottle in front of me (500ml - costs about 60p) and apparently there is 2200 cubic km of fresh water within half a mile of the surface of earth. This is 2.2x10^15 litres so at say 1 english pound per litre (rounding down) we arrive at a market cap of water of 2200000000000000 pounds. 
That figure is pretty useless. And so is the ripple market cap since 60% is kept by the company and should they ever release it the value will plummet.

All that matters is the block fork number, not the time. So all the coins you bought prior to the fork, exist on both forks. Hence in those wallets you'll have bitcoin gold. All coins bought after the fork we're only purchased on the bitcoin chain. 
Presently the only fork worth your trouble is likely to be the bitcoin gold fork. There are some other freebies in the post (bitcoin silver, super bitcoin, bitcoin god?!) but from what I've seen, many are looking like scams. Wait and see for those.

Lets put this in perspective. Tether was created because of the banking embargo's which many bitcoin exchanges endure because the banks hate bitcoin. Now I completely accept that tether could be running at a fractional reserve and it could all come crashing down. That will affect the exchanges which use tether, like bitfinex and poloniex. It will of course bring the bitcoin price down as well - 30-40% correction would be my guess. Maybe worse. Who knows. It will also bring down the entire altcoin market as well since tether trades in most altcoin exchanges and if bitcoin price can be pumped with tether, well guess what: so can every other coin. 
But I see tether as no different from casino chips. People are still buying tether - mostly just to get back into a fiat tethered currency while you have your money on a shady altcoin exchange. This is why 145 million dollars have been created since the hack. Sheer demand for tether on the exchanges. And provided people  can just as easily move back into bitcoin, people will continue to buy tether and have faith in tether. That's their call. We trust the casino will redeem our chips when we cash them in at the end of the evening. And we trust bitfinex will cash in our tether as well.

Ok so firstly pretty much every wallet now has lots of addresses - the big distinction is between receiving addresses and change addresses. The receiving addresses for your wallet are public addresses. But your wallet also contains change addresses. When you send some bitcoin from that wallet, the transaction actually sends all the bitcoins from that address; some go to the intended address and the rest go to the change addresses. Does that make a bit more sense? 
And in answer to your last question, yes - if you know a public address, you can easily lookup the balance on any block explorer you like. 
Edit: I should have pointed out that all your addresses (receiving and change) are derived from the same seed which generates all your public and private keys. This is what a [HD]( wallet really is. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:24:14

Yup. You'll have bitcoin gold for certain. Its a bit of a pain to get to it but basically you need to 
(a) move the real bitcoins to a new wallet THEN
(b) using the private keys (plural!) from the old wallet, import them into coinomi and you'll see the bitcoin gold. 
Edit: Sorry this isn't for certain. Check the transaction details when you filled your wallet with bitcoin. Was it before or after block 491406? If its before that block you've got bitcoin gold.

Demand for bitcoin comes for many different reasons. Currency depreciation (see Zimbabwe or Venezuela), buying drugs on the darknet (see any of the DNM on tor), or even international remittances (should it suit you). Bitcoin is currently the only way to reliably transfer value internationally and have the trade settled in ten minutes. Its far far easier to transport across borders and much easier to store and even hide, compared with gold or cash. If you're smart you can avoid it being confiscated. Its also bought as a hedge against the current world economic model, which is looking shaky at best.

Yes fiddling around with the token.txt file is the tricky bit, but immensely satsfying if you crack it. If you use something like %1,9a it will try all lowercase letters up to 9 characters in length and that used to crash my machine. Use the wildcards sparingly. Im nkt sure what you mean by "6down, 7down" but %A is wildcard for capital %a lowercase and %n for letters and numbers. %P tries pretty much any symbol on the key board. Good luck using that beyond 6 characters though!

Currently file sharing of copyrighted material is illegal and we already have the tools to monitor people doing such things in the clear. But the fact remains that so many people engage in illegal p2p filesharing that its impossible to practically stop it going on. Its like people smoking cannabis at a festival. Yes the police can go in and arrest a few people, but it isn't going to stop thousands upon thousands of people doing it. I see regulating crypto trades in a very similar way. It will be an unfeasible task to try and connect every single bitcoin address to an identity (which is essentially what you've been arguing is possible) and then follow each and every trade to tax it 'at source' as it were. And this is before we even talk about mimble wimble, confidential transactions or a host of other innovations in the crypto space. Or even simple things like [open dime]( prevent blockchain analysis from ever being that successful. I understand your concern but what you're suggesting is incredibly impractical.

There is a lot more to this than simply 'its better tech'. Bitcoin has gone through 8 years of ecosystem and brand development, significant VC investment and massive visibility. If crypto is going to become a game of 'last one to jump on the next big thing loses' then it really will be obvious to all that cryptos are useless for currency, since they won't hold their value beyond two years when the next big thing comes out. That's a possibility I guess. 
But I can't really see bitcoin being displaced by any of the so called 'better tech' coins. They all depend on bitcoins success - which is why you see them dump when bitcoin dumps hard. They simply don't have the support which bitcoin had in its infancy, and unless they can somehow unhook themselves to the bitcoin pairing (eth is the only coin that comes close) they will be forever bound by bitcoins success.

Yeah I think I understand what you're looking for. Essentially a bootstick on a usb so that the wallet is all kept on the stick - private key and everything. If that's correct and you're having trouble with tails I'd suggest a lightweight and easy to use linux distribution. Mint maybe, or xubuntu. I can walk you through creating a start up disk (boot disk) on your usb if you like. Its not too tricky. This guide will give you a bit of [choice]( with regards to the software you'll need to do it. Its good fun though creating a boot stick. They're really handy for lots of reasons.

I've only just caught up with your way of thinking here Meni (the correct way!) so I'm glad to have you steering the ship. It seems to me P(X&gt;47)=0.0000104284 is absolutely correct. But as you rightly point out if I 'scale' this up to one in every 44 years I've made the mistake of assuming each 4 hour stint may not 'overlap'. Classic blunder. If we assume (incorrectly but it shouldn't throw us off too much) that at each block we start afresh (there goes independence) then I'm getting an expectation of once every two years. In reality it will be slightly longer than this I think - so IMHO your simulation sounds spot on. Anyway, thanks for spotting my many mistakes. All the best.

Well it all depends on why you use bitcoin I guess. I don't pick a coin that can do the most transactions - there are lots of coins that can do better than us but in most cases they are far less secure. I agree transaction costs at the moment are a problem, but if you hold a lot of bitcoin then I don't think you can complain about a 40 dollar transaction when the value of the bitcoin your holding has increased by 40,000 dollars. That's my take on it. 
When I look at a lot of altcoins, there aren't any I see that have the properties I'm looking for (unconfiscatable, decentralised, cencorship resistant). I quite like vertcoin though. Litecoin maybe. I really like what factom is doing too. But I'm not a fan of ripple, or stellar. They're bank coins as far as I'm concerned.

Yeah it does seem a little slow. Currently I've been told that the ip address which accessed my account is blocked and that the order is still going through. What worries me is that support seem unaware that I'm still locked out of my account and that someone else has already changed the password. Accessing the account with a fresh ip should be childsplay. The more I think about it, the more I feel like support hasn't really understood the problem.

Just finished reading your paper - really interesting, essentially arguing that the efficiency of a market is the best way to predict future events and has many uses beyond simply prediction. I can see now that you wish to argue that the beliefs of the many are much more likely to be accurate when compared to the beliefs of the few. In most earthly instances I would agree: However, my background is in philosophy and maths. In both these disciplines there are counter-intuitive truths and it is a matter of historical record the instances where the majority of experts turned out to be wrong. I guess its not a huge criticism as a prediction market only gives you a probability and not a certainty. Its important to treat this figure as the majority opinion of the experts. Anyway I will try Robin Hanson's paper next. 
All the best.

I completely agree with you, (as I'm sure everyone else does here) - if you want to avoid your bitcoins being seized, its pretty straightforward to do so.

There are always get rich quick kids but they pretty much flock to the altcoin markets. I couldn't care less if banks are mining - as muffin says here - it's permissionless and money should always be politically and morally neutral. I never thought of this as a fight against banks - it's a fight about how the money supply is regulated. If the banks mine well it's still a lot better than them creating the value out of thin air - or the taxpayers/savers pockets.

*How should go about making it easier to trace funds in Bitcoin to avoid money laundering and tax evasion?
Its already very easy to trace transactions - and hide them! Any currency must negotiate the balancing act between transparency and privacy, and I think the pseudonymous approach works as well as can be hoped for.

I guess it all depends on whether you believe crypto could achieve reserve currency status. If you believe it could, then it will change the amount of debt. The current debts will default (you know they have to, as the amount owed is greater than the sum total of the world's assets). If of course the current system continues, with crypto as a side show, then of course nothing will change with regard to debts.

I agree - criticising a currency for the proportion of investors who are 'speculating' is red herring. China currently holds 3.2 trillion US dollars. They are speculating that this will hold its value. When you consider that according to SWIFT, only 1.4 trillion dollar transactions were recorded worldwide, its clear that the dollar is a currency propped up by speculation. Really you don't need to look any further than forex for evidence of massive currency speculation......
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:21:47
Sometimes the price goes up without any reason (apart from the obvious - more buyers than sellers) and sometimes the price goes down. Not everyone involved is a speculator. Some are conducting illicit business. Maybe one of these actors needed to cash out.

Can I also say as well (as I've worried about this over the years just as you have) - Bear in mind this all depends on your threat model. If you're like me your biggest threats are viruses, key loggers and other nasties you may have picked up while surfing casually as any gentleman does on the internet. If that is the case then you have several options:
(1) boot live from usb and generate the wallet, make a note of the address and write down the seed words to be kept somewhere safe. Go online without the usb and send from exchange to that address. Set up a watch only wallet on the computer so you can keep a reassuring eye on things
(2) Use a paper wallet from bitaddress. As someone else mentioned further down the page, you can do this from any machine offline, but you need to hope that there isnt any malware already on your machine which may somehow grab the private key you just generated. I think that is really really really really unlikely but people like to be sure. In which case you're back to boot from usb etc etc etc. 
(3) buy a very cheap raspberry pi and use that to achieve all this. Keep it perpetually offline or go online once to download electrum (great wallet) and set up the watch only on your regular comp. 
(4) Use a virtual box inside your regular computer to set up the wallet. I believe that should add a bit of extra security but its not perfect. 
My point is there is no perfect way to do this. But you probably don't need to go overboard. Im off to a party now but let me know if you get into the bios and if you need a hand I'm happy to help. Im no expert but I've managed to set up a nice raspberry pi solution for myself and I can offer advice there.

Your first argument is bizarre. For every bitcoin used, someone had to buy it from an exchange. More buyers at exchanges = higher price. Of course, if as you allege, every store accepting bitcoins immediately sells them, then that would be price neutral since every bitcoin bought is immediately sold on to another buyer. If increasing acceptance was inversely related to price then bitcoin should have been pretty expensive back in 2009. Just in case you aren't aware, it wasn't. 
Your second argument alleges that early adopters could suddenly stop hoarding and sell, and that this will invariably be bad for bitcoin. In fact its a necessity if price is to increase, as that is the only way we will get a fairer distribution of the currency. Without a fairer distribution of the currency, it will become worthless pretty quickly. 
And just to let you know, I currently own zero bitcoins.

It doesn't matter who owns the wallet addresses. It doesn't even matter if coins are lost, since the currency is currently sub-divisible to the eighth decimal place and potentially infinitely sub-divisible. 
If the government attempts to implement a ban on cryptography, how will it enforce such a ban. In essence, they would be banning the use of a branch of mathematics. You might as well try and ban History, Chemistry or Latin.

Its actually a very well written article which covers the interesting aspects of the history of money and what this can teach us about bitcoin. Whilst I don't agree with all the points raised, I was pleased to see that currency was presented as a collective hallucination of value rather than something 'backed' by gold, or The State or whatever. The importance of money as a ledger was also recognised. I forget who said it, but money is memory.

Firstly, we already have a one world currency called the dollar. Its accepted everywher. But we also have other competing currencies. This has been the case for at lleast four thousand years and I cant see any reason why this would change. What I like about bitcoin is the fact that if just a few very rich people own almost all of it, we can just say 'fuck you' and use one of the countless clones. Open source is a wonderful thing. Your comment about litecoin 'getting nowhere' could and would have been said about bitcoin don't you think??

If you're only sending money then you don't currently even need a full node. However, to receive **through lightning** your customers will need a full node I think. That was the situation a few weeks ago and as far as I know it hasn't changed.

Yeah like I say I would have had 2fa on if it had been serious money - I use 2fa on every exchange I trade on - but I have a hot wallet with 100 dollars in it to spend on bits n bobs, and I thought I'd give purse a shot. I get the feeling the problem may have started with my email addy being compromised. I really want to find out how it was done because if there is a key logger on here I want to know about it. And remove it. 
I'll certainly look into keepass though. Sounds like good advice.

Did you write down the private key somewhere, or save it on a mem stick? I am useless with tech and I once saved my multibit wallet in a different place whilst it was open. It was naturally a disaster and the wallet wouldn't open. But all I needed to do in the end was uninstall and reinstall multibit then import the private key. Its not too difficult if you've got that private key. Hope that helps buddy!

Sure, and sorry to see you've been downvoted. I imagine it would be very similar to local bitcoins, except the wallet escrow which would be decentralised - i.e not held on a central server which could be attacked.

I agree that we should be cautious in our optimism, but I can't see how the price depends on a programmers location. Bitcoin is actually spent in the US so really the market is over there - speculators in Russia and China will drive up (and down) the price, but the news driving these changes will still be coming out of the US. Merchants are now coming on board, but in my opinion its more important to get more people spending the stuff. 
In other words, we have to make the wallets even more idiot proof than they already are.

I'd be quite surprised if western governments attempt to prohibit the use of crypto-currency. If they could have done this, they already would have. You can't ban digits stored on ten's of thousands of computers worldwide. And you can't prevent people from trading their positions on this digital asset ledger by insisting that it has no value.

Great guide - I've got a node up and running but I'm reading through it anyway as I've had trouble maintaining stability. Quick question regarding the maxmempool - is it worth restricting this and does it reduce the stress on a low spec machine? I got my node going a couple of weeks back but I'm having real trouble with it stopping after a few hours (fails to keep up with the block height - getblockchaininfo seems to suggest the block height is a few blocks back and everything is fine). Could this be down to the hardware specs on my machine being laughably poor? Its the cheapest laptop in tescos. Just wondering if anyone can suggest some tweaks to the config file or anything else I can do to get more stability?

This could be completely wrong but it has exactly the same nine characters at the beginning (U2FsdGVkX) as a key which I had encrypted using AES from a multibit wallet.

If any one person or collection of people starts to dominate a crypto-currency, then it will be relatively straightforward for the masses to turn to an alternative.

Towards the end of the telegraph article they hint at what Osborne's agenda really is all about; strangling the use of the currency with VAT on goods and services.

I think its worth pointing out that bitcoin would have died a long long time ago without traders (speculators) betting on the price. If we didn't have the liquidity to provide on and off ramps then many of the tor market places just wouldn't have been able to function. I think you're absolutely right though with the demo poker analogy. 
It's also worth highlighting that there are many things you can do if you believe in this project even if you aren't a coder. Just accepting it as payment yourself and talking about why you think its important is a good start.

Funny how critical some are of Satoshi's economic credentials. I think the vast majority of economists can only be green with envy as they survey the largest economic experiment ever set up with *no* financial support. But silly old Satoshi, didn't forsee some of the minor (miner?) difficulties the network might face 5 years down the line. 
Bitcoin isn't perfect, but it's certainly demonstrated that trust can be decentralised. This will have huge implications for economists worldwide.

I understand the argument, but I think the analogy with nineteenth century free banking doesn't quite hold. This is the first time we have decentralised currency solutions; in the nineteenth century, the notes were issued by the banks themselves according to the whims of those in charge. Fortunately with bitcoin, we are protected from such excesses.

Ok glad to hear you're on board! The beautiful thing about linux is thanks to the supreme generosity of the people involved, its all free. And as you'll quickly realise, its better than windows. Anyway, follow these simple instructions here 
and you'll have a usb drive with ubuntu on it quite quickly. Downloading ubuntu will take a little while, maybe even an hour. After that follow the instructions to copy it onto the usb stick then plug it in and shutdown. When you turn it back on hit F12 (or another F button, the screen will tell you) and select the memory stick. Then follow the simple instructions and let me know if you get stuck. The great thing is, if you get stuck, the linux community is about as helpful and non-judgmental as it gets. I started using ubuntu about three or four years ago and I'd never go back to windows - i'm not a techie and everything is quite straightforward. Let me know if you need anymore help and all the best mate! Good luck!

I think if you take the internet - a good example of a technology which is intrinsically decentralised - its hard to argue otherwise. Decentralisation redistributes power and places it in everyones hands. I also really like the idea of democratising value. Let everyone decide how much a bitcoin is worth. Keep the altcoin scene strong so, if any institution should try to corner the market, the people can happily switch to another instead.

I can believe that there is some kind of manipulation going on with the Gox issue, but I don't believe the price will sky rocket if Gox resumes withdrawals.

Interesting. Reminds me of the time I put a bet on the Christmas Number 1 in the UK being Rage Against the Machine.

In the end it was a success and the odds market reacted narrowing down the margin everyday up until the day before christmas day. Prediction markets are powerful things....

Its pretty much all smoke and mirrors. The vast majority of coins listed on cmc have a very large volume of trading done on fake exchanges. [Here's]( a link which will walk you through how it happens. It's also a problem with bitcoin too but the larger the market and the more widely distributed the coin is, the harder it is to artificially inflate and hold that price at that level. But feel free to gamble on those coins if you like - just bear in mind that you probably will be betting against people who have a tremendous advantage over you.

Perhaps you're right and google will get the upper hand. But bitcoin is quicker and google will have to foot the bill for keeping their service free. It all comes down to the real processes which banks use to transfer money. I.e SWIFT and BACS. These are the services google will be using as they are the services we all use when transferring fiat electronically. These services cost money; the banks currently foot the bill for them. It is these services that bitcoin challenges.

Looks very straightforward. Fees at 5% of bitstamp asking price imply that for small transactions which need speed, this is certainly better than using a large exchange like bitstamp yourself. However, for larger transactions its probably better to use an exchange.

Currently all money is created as debt. Each time a mortgage is agreed with a bank, the lender literally creates the money out of thin air. The government has some control of this money supply through central banks conducting exactly the same practice. Bitcoin might not save us from usury, but it does offer us the chance to use a form of money with a fixed total number of coins.

I'm really intrigued by the 15% figure for Chinese Yuan. We know that the volumes for Chinese exchanges have collectively held at least 50% of trading volume since maybe October (acknowledging that this data may be exaggerated). Is the author saying that 15% of bitcoins are held in china? Or 15% of bitcoins were bought with the Yuan? Please provide a source for these claims. If they're true, then that certainly will influence the decisions of many crypto speculators....

@_date: 2014-10-29 21:43:15
You're right. Some people mine bitcoins and this naturally inflates the price. But provided the rate of adoption exceeds the rate of bitcoins mined, we will have far greater buying pressure than selling pressure as more people 'join the party'. The problem will of course be volatility. That, for me, is solely responsible for the recent drop in price. Chinese government moves around this time lasy year led to massive buying, then massive selling pressure. To my mind, its fair to say that it was overvalued given the relative immaturity of the currency. But given time......

Its a good question. Casino's use tokens to represent money, why can't western union, or the post office or whoever, use cryptographic tokens and send them safe in the knowledge that they can't be forged. I'm almost certain that they already do this using SWIFT or some other money transfer protocol with their banking partners. This costs a lot of money and the costs are passed onto their customers. The great thing from their point of view about using bitcoin is that the cost is transferred to the miners of bitcoin, who already get paid for donating their computing power to the network. The security of the network is guaranteed by the huge amounts of computing power maintaining the network. This, by my reasoning at any rate, is why decentralised cryptographic tokens will become very useful. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:24:24

@_date: 2014-03-11 22:55:35

Yes. They could spend millions of dollars inventing their own centralised crypto currency that has zero recognition and negotiate their way through all the KYC/AML bureaucracy all in order to have their name on the coin.  
Or they could simply incorporate bitcoin wallets into their software and take a very small cut of all transactions.
Don't get me wrong, I understand the point you make, but don't underestimate the costs involved with the alternative.

The older generation will not necessarily jump on-board the bitcoin bus (some probably will) but for the average person, they will use bitcoin when it becomes easier than using online banking to pay rent and bills. The price will storm as well, as the exchanges become busier. This viral positive feedback loop will only attract more investors/speculators, call them what you will. Programmable money should really help with the tedium and bureaucracy of managing money in perhaps unforseen ways.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but google wallet is nothing more than a payment processing aggregator. What this means is that you aren't using an alternative payments system, google wallet just stores all your card details and pays with whichever credit or debit card you like. 
In other words, google wallet just saves you the time required to type in your debit/credit card details, but still charges you the same as you would be charged if you'd just typed it in yourself.

I'm not sure that coins are currently being sold to relatively recent adopters. They might be being bought by old fans who view the current price as cheap.

You are of course correct. But initially the HMRC stated that they would apply VAT to bitcoin mining companies and exchanges, which obviously does not apply when trading other currencies.

You make a good point about online wallets: We all know that plenty of online wallets were hacked in the beginning, but as bitcoin has become more popular, it has become a lot easier for people to identify the online businesses that take wallet security seriously, ie a large proportion of coins kept in cold storage etc etc etc. Maybe that combined with two factor auth is the best way to go for newcomers who are uncomfortable with technology.....

We're encouraged to think that the national debt is no different to a personal loan that you or I might take out in times of need. The truth is really very different, and you can see this when you consider the fact that under any rational analysis, international credit and debt should be a zero sum game. I.E the UK currently owes £1.3 trillion pounds, yet there is no 'country' it has borrowed the money from. Every country has a national debt and the money is owed to pension funds, investors and private institutions. In fact, only 3% of the UK money supply is created without the debt taint. The vast majority of money is created by the fractional reserve system that allows banks to lend out approximately 9 times what they hold in reserve. If the world were to change (gradually) to a crypto-currency, the banks would no longer have the outrageous privilege of 'minting' their own currency at the stroke of a pen. It is high time we had economic democracy, and Bitcoin and its associates offer us the best chance of this.

I am quite happy for the government to coexist with bitcoin, but I certainly don't want them interfering with the protocol.

FRB has created a situation where private companies control the money supply of sovereign nations.

Thanks very much for the links, I will check them out. With regard to the Global Warming example, I would argue that its still possible for the minority view to be more likely to occur than the majority view. Surely the prediction market would only give you the probability that this precise proportion of people are correct regarding their views on global warming, and *crucially* not the probability of a particular view on global warming being *factually* correct. In this sense, prediction markets will only be accurate when all that matters is the opinion of the majority, the most obvious example being elections. But I will read those papers as I'm sure you've addressed this issue many times before. Thanks once again!

We don't know what has happened to those coins. I'm sure the truth will come out eventually but I'm not surprised its happened. Bitcoin is a currency that was born in the shadows, supporting an underground economy that was bound to attract some 'ne'er-do-wells'.

@_date: 2014-11-03 14:52:55
The way I see it, bitcoin's value against fiat will stabilise with the passage of time provided there are fewer and fewer systemic shocks as the ecosystem matures. The recent price falls have been due to large hodlers and big mining firms cashing out without buyers matching them. Personally ive never really bought the hoarding argument. People hoard all sorts of things, doesn't lead to those items losing value.

Sorry matey it appears I've given you very bad advice. The wallet generation seeds don't seem to be compatible so you'll have to import the private key, which is what I *think* I originally did.

If you want to be able to watch over your cash on both your devices, there seems to be a bitcoin mpk watcher which might suit you.

I can see your point that people currently aren't that safety conscious when it comes to their credit card info - but I think that's because there are guarantees from VISA etc that protect the consumer against fraud. Bitcoin being decentralised obviously has no such guarantees.

Not really, its a lovely site. But bear in mind that fiat doesn't leak everytime someone buys bitcoin. The exchange data they use certainly doesn't include localbitcoins or a whole variety of other trades that take place. It gives a distorted view of the buying in China, where it is now widely acknowledged that exchanges fake their trading data. Perhaps a better idea of how widespread bitcoin use is can be obtained from these sources.

I understand the arguments you are making concerning centralisation. You may be right regarding human behaviour, but I think the jury is still out on that one - Remember that each mining pool in in itself decentralised, in a sense. Peer to pool might go some way towards redressing the balance. We shall see. 
But I think to deride Satoshi as someone ignorant of economics is churlish. He's created a currency with a 6 billion dollar market cap. I'd like to see Stephen D Levitt trump that.

Why would the tree have to be rolled back?

I'm not advocating for this (I'm quite happy for them to be donated to the community!), I'm just curious how changes to the code are instigated with the support of the community.

In the UK almost all online banking uses 2FA and most people seem to have coped with that. Let's not completely underestimate the 'average joe' here. 
User adoption will happen gradually - look at the history of credit cards - they only managed to become widely used after mass mailings sending the cards to anyone with a bank account. As there is no marketing department for bitcoin, we don't have that luxury. 
Wallet software has come a long way making it easier for idiots like myself to understand what's going on. I think we just need to give it more time, least thats my two cents.

Governments can do a great deal to threaten the success of bitcoins by going after the exchanges. Fortunately for us bitcoiners, there are loads of exchanges located all over the world.

Firstly you're an idiot. The children you describe have all contributed to the development of the world's first decentralised currency. Writing in block capitals doesn't help to support your argument, which is essentially that governments will co-opt the currency and centralise it. 
This shows you have no understanding of what the protocol is. It can't be centralised. Its distributed trust in a network. 
and the foundation is really just a figurehead and symbol without any real control over the currency. 
and the only way they could 'centralise' bitcoin is by buying into it - and then we could respond by using another crypto.

Ok - first lesson in buying on localbitcoins. Use their wallet. The whole point of localbitcoins is that they offer an escrow service. That means they hold the sellers bitcoins after (s)he has decided to sell them to you. That way, if you want to dispute the trade, you can log a dispute and prove that you sent the money to the seller's account. 
I'm not sure what you can do if you don't have the localbitcoins wallet protection. I think you'll find that he has to use the wallet service as well. Have you spoken to the admin staff at localbitcoins? 
edit: also, ask the seller to provide a transaction id for the trade. We can see it on the block explorer then. Apologise and explain that you're new to this. I really can't see how the seller can avoid sending the bitcoins to your lbc wallet if you opened a trade online with him.

I'll be perfectly honest, I'm no expert with multisig as I've never used it so I don't really want to offer advice.

I'm sure another bitstamp user will be able to help out, sorry I can't be of more help.

@_date: 2014-10-05 16:22:28
The way I see it, the 30k seller has two possible motives. 1. Sell all coins as they are currently over valued and will be worth less in the future. 2. Try to scare people into selling to pick up some cheap coins. If the second motive is correct, then its up to the market to call the seller's bluff and buy the coins. Whales can send the market in either direction, and no-one ever cries 'manipulation' when the value of their investment has risen.

Ok you know the words you wrote down? Well that is your private key (in a different format). All electrum wallets understand how to turn those words into a private key so youre good. 
The master public key is a different beast. Its really useful if you want to set up a 'watch only wallet' on another computer which is online (I do this). So you keep your bitcoin private key offline (no nasty hacker can get your coins) but you can watch that wallet using the master public keys. Please ask if you need any more help, I'm no cryptographer or programmer so if I can get the hang of this so can you :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:25:46
Its a valid question. Why shouldn't governments just develop their own crypto, the tech is open source after all! I think buying that kind of hashing power just isn't possible because as I say, you'll need to acquire a network that is just as robust if you want everyone to use it. Also, you'll need to persuade the man in the street to use your govcoin. How do you intend to convince them it is worth it? The selling point of bitcoin is that it is not owned by anyone. The majority of people are pro-government when it comes to security and welfare, but anti-government when it comes to taxes and finance. It would be a tough sell asking people to contribute to the costs of a new currency IMHO
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:05:27
I also find the claim that 350 million quids worth of bitcoin was lost over several years a bit of a stretch to say the least. Its beyond incompetence and any rational actor would not manage to lose such a vast amount of cash. It presumes that there was literally no auditing, external or internal, for years. 
The alternative is of course that this was a deliberate theft. Well, this I disbelieve for entirely different reasons. Computer programmers aren't normally too cocky when it comes to shafting the criminal underworld. Put simply, I don't believe the Gox staff have the balls for that. 
The only other alternative is an incredibly skillful heist that has taken place in the last month. This is a possibility I guess.....
just my two cents. Personally, I'm buying and holding.  
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:07:44
Whats the big deal about massive sell offs. When they occur for no obvious reasons (other than the fact that the price has been rising relentlessly for days) then all that happens is another big buy straight after the dump. Its just not that easy to game the market, even when its relatively small and illiquid like bitcoin. Relax, give it an hour, and we'll be back at 660. Like always, the best time to buy is after a dump.

the porn industry was one of the first (if not the first) to figure out the new business model of the 21st century. Charging people for media doesn't work anymore, its too easy to obtain copies practically for free. So they made the sites free but levied the funds through advertising revenues (not unlike spotify). However, this model isn't perfect as many are happy to pay a small fee to avoid these intrusions - Bitcoin is uniquely placed to serve as a way of processing micropayments for each clip watched. This applies not just to porn but all other forms of online media. But we shall see if I'm right....

A HD wallet has lots of receiving addresses which are all derived from the master public key. All those receiving addresses are separate but linked to the master. 
I'm curious though, which exchange are you using? You'll need the private key to sign the transaction, but you might find it easier to use a simpler two factor authentication option (which admittedly will not be as secure, but no method is perfect).

send that conversation to the localbitcoins people after contacting the admin staff and explaining what has happened. A seller with over 400 trades shouldnt be avoiding the small localbitcoins fee by asking you to use a coinbase wallet. He will want to protect his reputation I suspect. Ive used lbc for hundreds of trades since 2013 and I've never had any trouble whatsoever. What he's done is against the terms and conditions of lbc. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:04:24
Well I'll have a stab but I'm by no means an expert. That could work to my advantage, lets see. 
Essentially, when you create a bitcoin address (a public/private key pair), you don't need to be online to 'talk' to the network to achieve this. The algorithms used are included in the wallet software and can come up with an address offline. As a result of this, you can use an address (a public private key pair) which no one even knows exists. After that, you can send bitcoins to this wallet using the public key and the transaction will be broadcast to the network (that bit will take place online). But most importantly, your private key will never appear online so no one can use virus's, trojans, keyloggers or any other nasty stuff to steal your precious dragon eggs.
The way I do it is I've downloaded electrum (a wallet) onto a computer and then taken that computer permanently offline. I then created a wallet and sent coins to that wallet knowing that without physical access to that computer, no one can steal those coins. I also set up a watch only wallet on my online computer so I can keep an eye on funds - I can also send money from the offline wallet by signing transactions offline but thats not necessary and a bit more complicated.

Lots of questions. I'm not an expert but I'll take a stab at this one. 
Question: what happens if tbe file is copied? I understand the original should be erased or useless when the copy is transfered to an other wallet?
Don't think of bitcoins as files. I own bitcoins because I am (hopefully) the only one who knows the private key related to my public bitcoin address. Hence the blockchain, which exists on any computer with bitcoin-qt has a record of my address and current balance. Bitcoins are stolen because this private key is stored in a file called 'wallet.dat'. If a hacker steals that key he can move your bitcoins to a different address with a different private key. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:18:49
That's true. See. British Pound, Swiss franc etc etc. There will never be just one currency in a world of 7 billion people. No currency will ever be accepted everywhere. The closest we have to that now is the dollar. We already have over three hundred crypto currencies. I think you need to stop reading poorly researched articles about the 'New World Order' and recognise your true enemy. Centralised power.

First got into this in september 2013 and bought about 20btc for  120 dollars each. sold july 2014 for 700$ each. Tidy profit! Then bought again just recently - 2 btc  per coin and about 3 days ago 3btc @ 270 dollars per coin. In my own currency, I'm down about £400 in just 72 hours. Fuck it though. I'm buying more when I get paid.

Whew.  225k. Clearly, like myself, you are a true gambler, so I'll skip the patronising remarks about only investing what you can afford to lose and move onto technical analysis.  Bitcoin has proved its here to stay, BUT the honeymoon euphoria has passed. Merchant adoption has progressed well but thats to be expected as companies like bitpay have enabled companies to accept crypto at no cost. This ensures that the currency is taken seriously enough to avoid crashes to zero dollars but doesn't support a market cap of ten billion dollars. The price got driven up during the euphoric phase by speculators like you and I, but many of those have now divested.....but they will stay interested. What we need to watch for now are signs of genuine consumer interest and 'killer apps'. Im not sure I feel comfortable telling you to hold or sell but I would judge it on the number of wallet downloads and any interesting news coming from the remittance side of the markrt. Best of luck whatever happens dude....you'll be ok. Family is more important than money.

I think the most important feature for money is trust. Trusting that you can exchange that which is given to you for something else, with pretty much anyone else. I don't think people accept roubles in Russia because of 'guns' - otherwise they would have been too scared to switch to dollars when CCCP collapsed. Same in the EU, we don't use euro's because we're anxious about the non-existent army. Its a matter of trust - not so much in the note being genuine (although that is a concern) but more in the trust that you can re-spend it with someone else. Provided bitcoin gradually establishes trust amongst a wider and wider circle of people, it will compete very well with national currencies, which will have to work hard to keep up with the innovation in the crypto-currency space.

I think you have to give the OP credit here. If I have understood correctly, he is saying that his initial deposit address sent the money straight to this address and those bitcoins have not moved ever since. Whilst it doesn't help us decide how Gox will behave, it does indicate that its highly unlikely those coins are now resting with someone else. Unless of course this address actually belongs to someone else, who happens to have 200btc per wallet just resting in their account. Personally, I can see his point; Gox still has his bitcoins, at the very least........

I understand exactly what you are saying. Have you tried contacting Kraken about this to see what their response is? Like I say, I can believe insider trading goes on all the time in the crypto space (cough ..... poloniex......cough cough). But there are also several inconsistencies in your account of what has occurred. After all, a few big volume buys after the event on one exchange might well trigger a short squeeze, but that isn't going to last forever. Surely by now we would have seen the sell pressure building up again?

Totally agree - whilst paper wallets have their own drawbacks, i think theyre great for new people in terms of educating them about what it means to "own bitcoins".

Helps people better understand the important bits IMHO.

All fair questions, but worth noting that lightning is an option that you don't have to use. Its designed to be useful for micropayments. This is relevant to your issue regarding receiving capacity, as well as the point about being online. These are only issues faced by merchants, who presumably have more to gain from offering lightning payment solutions and are therefore more committed to keeping their node well maintained.

I got in around summer 2013, so just before the price rise and subsequent collapse. There were plenty of people who felt that it was never gonna go near a thousand dollars again; Gox losing close to a billion dollars isn't a good look and we had all the coins from silk road getting auctioned off by the US gov so there was plenty of negativity to go round. But still there were also plenty of optimists too, and most importantly people who were just having fun with the idea of economic freedom. Fundamentally, a currency which no one can control has a thousand use cases, most of which I expect we haven't even anticipated. Currencies have always been used to harass populations into submission. Those days are, I hope, on their way out the door.

Naturally finding the exact figure is impossible, but that doesn't mean trying to find a reasonable estimation is hopeless. Here's a piece of research from Cambridge University that was tracking users in 2017 (so two years ago, just before the big bull run). They arrived at a figure of three million users. I think its reasonable to assume that figure has inflated after the massive increase and subsequent crash in price.

I'm not 100% certain, but I think the confusion stems from change addresses. Every time you spend from an address, everything moves from that address. But the change is returned to you at a different address called a 'change address'. Practically every wallet nowadays kind of pretends change addresses aren't really happening, but they definitely are 'under the hood'.

To be honest I started to doubt that I'd win as the more I thought about it, the more likely a flash crash dip below 900 bucks seemed. Its still very possible that someone with big bags is ready to drop them in the given time frame so still all to play for. 
My original thinking was simply that there are still two more etf's to go (admittedly the chance they will be approved is a lot less likely now) and a lot of geopolitical uncertainty. I think the rise was down to the halving after effects from last year (btc never rises fiercely after halving - it takes its sweet time). So yeah, the recovery was swift because there are still a lot of believers out there. I guess the money pouring into bitcoin is not quite as cynical as we might have suspected. 
Also, like I say the bet is still in play so best of luck either way and thanks for being a decent fellow about it :)

 That's not the way it works. If they included fewer transactions in the block to 'send a message that fees need to increase', they'd just end up collecting less transaction fees. Remember there's no guarantee either that they will find the block, so it makes sense that if they do, they'd like to include as many (fee paying) transactions as possible. If you look back at past halving events, there has been no evidence that miners are rejecting transactions to stimulate the fee market and force it to rise higher. Because they're in competition with other miners who will undercut them.

I'll write it down for you: 
"Bitcoin has selloffs because its less liquid than gold is and bonds are certainly, it also has a steady stream of new bitcoins coming into the market so unless new demand is coming in, yes there is going to be downward pressure on the price. What would make new demand come in? Perhaps some macro event, perhaps a change in sentiment perhaps a shift in portfolios even, we just don't know. But as you know (you've been following this market for quite a while you know it very well) it'll trade stable until suddenly it doesn't and then the narrative becomes self-fulfilling, the narrative becomes about the price. People are suddenly asking each other the price all the time and people are even those of us who don't check it every single day are checking it every five minutes. The price then becomes the story and that comes and goes. We saw in 2017 the price was the story the fundamentals became irrelevant. The price is not the story today, the fundamentals are the story, and that is going to build a much wider acceptance and understanding of this new asset class." 
Waffle from the other guy interviewing her about news stories being down since 2017 and whether the potential pool of true believers is declining. Then: 
"It requires belief but it depends by whom? Does it require belief by the eventual market in the broader use case? Perhaps but it depends on what you think the eventual use case is going to be. Does it need to be used as a payment mechanism to be accepted as a store of value by the market?  I would say probably not. Is it a store of value today given its volatility and when there are other options in the market? Again probably not, but most of us that are investing in bitcoin and I confess that I have a small holding myself (disclosure), we're investing in it because we believe its going to be a store of value tomorrow, right now perhaps it doesn't have the fundamentals for that but we're not investing in it for today we're investing in it for tomorrow."

1. Most people will tell you should really download electrum (and check the signature) from another computer, then put it on a usb or something and install it on your cold wallet computer which should never go online. Its true but probably rather paranoid and you'll almost certainly be fine if you never go online again with it. 
2. I think there are 2000 words in the dictionary they use so 2000\^12=2\^132 and I think anything above 2\^60 is considered secure. 
3. Why not give the thing a password. It mainly protects you from people close to you grabbing your cold wallet and spending from it. Remember though, this won't stop someone who has the seed words. The seed words are your bitcoins really. Whoever has that seed, can spend the bitcoins regardless of anything else.

You're right that communities should be open to critical points of view, without friction no shine ey! And yes I'm sure many people may have lost money if they bought after the price had increased by a factor of 15 over a few months.
But I'm struggling to find evidence to support your claim that a drop in transactions correlates with a drop in the price. For example, there was a drop from May 2017 to August 2017 where tx per day fell from 2200 to just 1300 per block. In that period the price of btc doubled from 1500 dollars to 3000 dollars. Transactions per block for the last two years have fluctuated between 1000 and 3000 per block. A greater number of transactions being batched is also something worth taking into consideration. It might be worth looking at other metrics too, like amount per day in dollar terms being transacted and things like that.

Ok so creditors were given a choice about six months ago in the CR process. Would they like to be paid out in fiat or bitcoin? Those who selected btc are unlikely to immediately dump, unless they've had a change of heart from six months ago. Likewise those who were paid out in fiat, are unlikely to buy bitcoin, unless they've decided its now cheap enough for them to jump back in. 
The only uncertainty regards bch. For those who elected to be paid in crypto, they'll be receiving btc and bch I believe. This could lead to a bch dump. Who knows.

The distribution around the mean is not symmetrical for a poisson distribution, and this creates confusion as people see that occasionally the time between blocks is 30 minutes or more - obviously its impossible to be 20 minutes quicker than ten minutes so this leads people to believe that something odd is going on. A negative exponential distribution (the probability that a block is found in a given time interval) would be really useful to you. Try this site: 
Enter the population mean as 10 (10 mins on average to find a block) and then for example X&lt;=1 gives 0.0952. This implies that 9.52% of blocks will be found in less than one minute. Whereas X&gt;=60 gives 0.25% so roughly 1 in every 400 blocks will take an hour or longer to find. So roughly every three days you can expect one block to take longer than an hour to find. Hope that makes sense.
Edit: Just counted the number of blocks found in less than a minute in the last 100, and I counted 11 blocks. Pretty close to 9.5% ey!

Firstly I'd just like to say I respect your point of view and appreciate a calm discussion about this rather than the typical ranting that you get online. So cheers! 
In response to your point, I'd say that I can't really see any evidence on the major exchanges (coinbase, gemini, bitstamp) for 95% fake volume. There was a good study which looked at tracking fake volume, let me find it. Here it is: [ 
It tends to be the altcoin exchanges (Binance being an exception) which fake volume, in order to lure active traders onto their platform. There's not a doubt in my mind that some exchanges like poloniex have suffered a 90% drop in volume - they lost a lot of customers to binance after some very shady outages at crucial pump times. But in terms of just bitcoin trading, well look no further than local bitcoins. Given the type of platform that it is (peer to peer), its almost certainly not going to be faking volume like an exchange does. It would be hard work to do that! Well this shows a much more consistent picture. Volume peaked at the height of the bubble up to 20k, then halved from there in global USD terms and has remained there ever since. I'd say that's a pretty good indicator that demand has remained consistent. [

Yeah you may well be right, particularly with bch where I think the hash power is more likely to fluctuate. Incidentally, hash power estimates are always based upon time taken for blocks to arrive. So if the average block time goes under ten minutes, you can assume that hash power of the network has increased since the last difficulty adjustment. Anyway, that site is pretty handy if you ever want to decide how unusual the block times are. All the best mate to you and your daughter!

The tricky bit with a node on the pi is downloading 600000 blocks, once youve done that its fine in my experience. So what i ended up doind was downloading the chain on my laptop then changing the config file on the pi so it knew where to find the blockchain. Running smoothly (over tor) ever since.
Oh and by the way, old pi's can make great offline wallets too.

Paine's work is awesome - I've got lots of time for Paine. I can also understand why some Marxists might fight against unemployment benefit, since it could be perceived as a trap that holds the lower orders in their place. Not so convinced that Marxists would be against schools and hospitals run by the state. 
On most issues I'm quite conservative, although I believe that state should provide free education and health care. I'd like to see a land tax implemented and possibly a bigger tax on services.

Very interested in this - looked into coinfloor a while back and decided that for all the faff it was probably easier to go with LBC or bittylicious. But I'm open to trying new places and methods. Could someone just check my comprehension on the new fee model. To buy £1000 of btc, I would pay £5 then 0.00038x995= £3.78. Then I would also pay a fee of 0.005btc to withdraw (roughly £3.50). So all together about 12 quid in fees in a £1000 trade. Is that about right?

I remember when I first got involved which was mid 2013 - 90% of bitcoin trading was done on the chinese exchanges.

I disagree with your analysis, which isn't based on mathematics. Its based on the premise that bitcoins are currently overvalued and will inevitably fall. It will rise and fall and rise, but I believe its grossly undervalued at the moment, and will inevitably rise. Both our positions are rational, but based on different assumptions. These assumptions are quite subjective. I think there is a need for a ledger that is open and impossible to shutdown, you believe its a scheme for embezzling funds from gullible investors. Time will tell. I'm pretty sure I'll be having the last laugh :)

The easiest way to find your hidden ~/Library/ folder is to do the following:
    Open the Finder
    Hold down the Alt (Option) and choose Go
    You will see the ~/Library folder listed below the Home folder
Alternatively, you could do the following:
    Open the Finder

    Type ~/Library into the text box and press go
You can now see and access the contents of the ~/Library which were previously hidden from sight.

A bank transfer will surely always be traceable to you, since the bank will know who you are? (Unless I'm missing something?) 
When people want to buy bitcoins anonymously, they either:
(a) buy it with a bank account but subsequently tumble the coins, (there are lots of ways to do this, some more effective than others - using shady altcoin exchanges and transfering into privacy coins is one way to do this). 
(b) buy in person from a seller locally (from using localbitcoins or something similar). 
(c) mine the bitcoin themselves (almost impossible now the hash rate is so high). 
Either way, someone somewhere will probably know who you are. Ask yourself who you need privacy from, then act accordingly. Its all about the threat model.

Firstly regarding your second question, all I can say is i've sold and bought high four figure and sold five figure on localbitcoins without the bank stopping the trade. I even took the precaution of telling Barclays what I was doing because I needed the money for a mortgage deposit and they said that was absolutely fine. There is nothing illegal regarding buying and selling bitcoins (although like you say, I still wouldn't put that in the reference). So I think you'll be ok there. 
BUT, the bank will be aware that youve moved 30k to an account which you never did any business with before, and that in itself will look suspicious even years from now. So don't think they can't guess that you're up to something! 
Regarding accountants, they don't need to know about bitcoin. They just need to know about hiding capital gains. So for example, set yourself up as a bitcoin trading company (register at companies house), pay your wife a salary from the company for doing administrative tasks over a few years. Hey presto. No tax to pay. There are so many people fiddling their taxes (see every mp in westminster) that I think its only fair the little guy gets to play that game too!

Its not as difficult as you might think. Essentially the process is this: 
set up two wallets. One for [bitcoin]( and one for the other [coin](
Send from your current wallet to the first wallet. Then import the bip39 seed into the second wallet. 
Voila. You've done it. 
I'm not technical, but I managed to sell almost immediately after the fork and I made 12%. Woohoo 
If you need any more help, just ask.

depends which wallet you send it to. Set up two wallets. One called [electrum]( and the other called [electron cash]( Provided you had the bitcoins in the old multibit wallet before the fork you will be able to claim both. The one thing you'll need to do is make sure electron cash wallet is using the correct server. See [this]( guide to help you. 
First send the coins to electrum. Those are the real bitcoins. Then import seed to electron cash. Those are the bcc ones.

Finex may have played this badly, but it was clearly stated in their statement on how they were handling the fork.

It wasn't (too) difficult to do, and I say that as someone who isn't really technical, but can follow simple instructions.

Whilst I don't think it's fair to say Hodlers aren't helping (they're supplying miners with fiat to keep the network running), I think you're right in that a few years ago, we used to celebrate every time another big company got on board the bitcoin bus (expedia, just eat, overstock etc etc). Nowadays so many places accept bitcoin I guess we don't consider it newsworthy anymore. 
But you're right. The more widely accepted it is as currency, the higher the velocity, the higher the value. But equally, removing some of the currency from circulation has its benefits. Both types of people are welcome here :)

When you say 'raising flags', I presume you mean that the trade doesn't go through. In the past, I've found that even with five figure deals on lbc, everything has gone through smoothly (by the way, I'm also in the UK). I think buying in small chunks of £3000 is the best way to do it. 
If you're thinking about avoiding the tax that you potentially will have to pay should btc go up in value, well that's another story. I think its still pretty straight forward - just sell in small chunks for cash and into different bank accounts. Always nice to have more than one :) - this money could easily have come from online gambling, and so you could argue that its tax free. Don't take my word for it though. Speak to a good accountant. Worth their weight in gold if you ask me.

I think hardware wallets are a fair bit safer than desktop wallets, however I would like to add a serious caveat. Nothing beats a good understanding of private keys when it comes to safety. You can have the latest and greatest in terms of a hardware wallet, but you're only one successful phishing attempt away from losing all your funds. Bottom line for security is (1) understand how and why security practices are important then (2) buy a proper hardware wallet or develop your own approach to cold storage.

@_date: 2017-01-02 14:33:52
This is the best layman's explanation I've read so far, thanks very much! I could always get my head around most things, save the difficulty adjustment. I presume that the mechanism for adjusting it takes into account just the average time taken to find the previous blocks (since this is available and hashed into the blocks) and then adjusts the target lower, if the miners are 'cracking' the hash faster, and higher, if the miners are slowing down for some reason. Is this roughly correct? 
edit: Oooh another question. Would all miners start with the nonce at zero. Or is there some strategy involved, say trying nonces which other miners are unlikely to be trying at the same time? Or do they just use a random number generator. I just have so many questions. Can you suggest any good books on the subject?

I agree 100%. The trouble is sheer inertia and unwillingness to learn new things here. You and I both know its not difficult to look after your own coins (hope I'm not tempting fate here). But when people start talking about using a preloaded usb to boot into a fresh machine, non tech people switch off. That's why I think it would be better to advise them just to download a wallet on their machine and make sure they encrypt it with a password. I know that's poor security (key loggers, virus's etc etc) but provided they aren't storing a fortune, it will probably be ok. We need simple but effective advice for them. They are easily intimidated by a long list of steps......

Good but you missed out some important bits. Most of these exchanges have fees for shitmunchers like you and me. But if you're a market-maker (whale) and you provide liquidity to these markets, well I'm sure the exchange can offer you sweetheart deals like 'no fees' (hence the volume bots) and, even scarier than that,  access to the (non public) order book information. I wonder how many of these exchanges trade on their own platform? 
Probably all of them. Who's gonna stop them!

Ok so firstly you should have set up the watch only wallet on a computer connected to the internet. Thats how you can see your precious bitcoins are still there - but the point is that the private key isn't stored on that machine (and has never been near it) just the master public key which is useless to a thief. 
On tails you should set up your offline wallet. When you generate a wallet, that will have a private key which crucially never goes online. Take the master public key from that and use it to generate the watch only wallet. 
And yes those seed words are your private key. You must keep them safe. If you tell me them, I will steal your bitcoins. Don't tell anyone.

Funnily enough, this argument has been made before.

The open source permissionless  nature of bitcoin shares some similarities with democratic ideals but I agree with you that a meritocracy is a better description.

His liquidation helped the price move up, since he had to buy back the btc he'd already sold short. But I don't think its accurate to say that lots of people betting the price will go down (high amounts shorting), is in any way bullish for the price. The opposite view (that a lack of shorts is bearish) is also false. The long and short trades just show the range of beliefs regarding which way the price will go.

So you still have the multibit wallet. I can't see why you can't just install electrum and send your coins to your new address? You don't need the seed to send bitcoins to addresses. You just need the password for the wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-27 16:02:06
UK resident here. 
We haven't got what I would call a 'proper' exchange because there is a very real banking embargo against exchanges. For example, coinfloor is the closest thing we have to an exchange but I believe you have to go through a polish bank account to put funds on there (please correct me coinfloor users if I'm misinformed). 
So basically I think you're best bet is local bitcoins. If you're selling it really isn't so bad - you get a price very close to what you would get going through an exchange. If you're buying its always a serious percentage above exchanges and thats when it sucks a bit. 
Other options include bittylicious which is good for beginners - or if you use localbitcoins a lot you'll eventually get friendly with some of the regular traders and you can do some off book stuff without escrow (risky but sometimes you've just got to trust people to save cash). 
Edit: if you're not cashing out too much (&lt; grand sterling) let me know and I'll buy them off you on localbitcoins if you like - no amount too small. PM me if interested.

By that rationale, if satoshi hadn't created bitcoin, someone else would have. We have spv wallets thanks to Mike. You may not like him, but you really should respect what he did for the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:05:24
I think what you're describing as the passphrase is normally referred to as the seed - but I could be wrong. To clarify, the password encrypts the file containing the wallet seed. The wallet seed is 12 (or 11 or 13 I think) words and that is the 'master key' to the bitcoin. Basically the private key in an easy to remember format.
Funny story: when I first got into bitcoin I told my brother he didnt need the password if he had the multibit file. Since in the file was the private key. I was very wrong. In the file was the *encrypted* private key. Only took me six months to crack it. You live and learn.

Ok lets get to the bottom of this. Your BCC coins are safe so don't worry. Go through the following checklist:
Did you send the coins from copay to ELECTRUM. Check this transaction on the normal bitcoin block explorer? 
Did you then send this to a new electrum wallet just to move it to a fresh electrum? (check once again on block explorer)
Did you then install electron cash and use the seed from the first electrum wallet you generated? 
Finally on the electron cash wallet did you select a server for electron cashcaria? 
After doing all these things you could check on the respective block explorers for each chain that your coins are where they should be. 
Let me know how you get on matey

I feel its only fair to give the other side of the story. If we didn't have people trading bitcoin's actively on the exchanges, surrendering their keys to these centralised services so that a market exists, bitcoin would not be where it is today. I keep the vast majority of my coins in cold storage - but the coins I trade with have to be left on a centralised exchange with decent volume. 
I only say this because I'm tired of the private key lectures from enthusiasts who don't understand that without the traders, the hodlers wouldn't be as rich as they are today.

Can I admit its less money for miners? Well perhaps but I seriously doubt it and here's why. Lightning is there for microtransactions - for bigger transactions its likely that it will be too awkward finding a well funded route and so you can use lightning but you'll need to open up a channel first and guess what? The miner has been paid. By its very design, its geared towards small value transactions. We need the miners. We need the exahashes of support which make the network so damn secure. No one wants to see the miners go out of business. But no one wants to see miners run bitcoin completely either. Its a system of several entities - users, miners, exchanges and node operators - each of whom hold the other three to account. 
And for what its worth, I didn't downvote you. Social validation online is probably a waste of time anyway. Who cares what anyone else thinks?

Crypto is here to stay now IMHO - but we could be due our 2 year bear market which almost always kicks in after parabolic rises. The hangover from the party as it were. If you're trading in the short term it *might* be a good idea to reduce your exposure. Diversify and all that jazz. Keep an eye out for big dips and try and snaffle them up. Keep an eye out for another harf fork in november and see how that resolves itself. My guess is we end up going segwitx2 in november and bch dies a death. This is just my guess though.

fair enough. I completely agree with you there. I think you'll find most people who trade using the exchanges are absolutely aware of how to store their gains.

Fair question! Trouble as well with giving it to people not so interested, is that in my experience they always lose the wallet (and I did this years ago, so they lost x8 what I gave them). Tricky tricky. Ideally you'd like them to spend it on goods rather than sell at an exchange, encourage the ecosystem and all that.

basically, as far as I'm aware, everyone who had bitcoins in their wallets at block 478558 will have both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Since on bitcoin proper we're now on block 478567 I believe (please correct me if I'm wrong) that means you can now safely dump bitcoin proper since you will still own the pretender, bitcoin cash. 
I'm not a bitcoin cash supporter, but if I was I would do that.

Your example is instructive and demonstrates how misleading market cap is.

I seem to remember when i first got into this in 2013 there was more *vision* in the comments i'd read on this subreddit. Then again, there kinda had to be because venture capital was just on the cusp of pouring into the space. In most media commentaries we we're still being laughed at. The biggest exchange was just about to mislay 700 million dollars and the ecosystem was fragile and immature.
We've come a long way since then. Large exchanges have popped up in all corners of the globe, use of the network is at all time highs and every fintech startup has 'blockchain' in its sights. There are all kinds of people taking notice now, and IMHO there are some subversive efforts to undermine our success taking place. But as you say, much of the mud slinging occurs over minor details - (and call me a heathen but for me blocksize is a minor technical detail which i leave to those better qualified - the devs). We need to reconnect with the reasons we got involved with this grand economic experiment. We all want the same thing after all.....

Hey nulsec. You're missing the point with your argument for inflationary currency, but that's ok because if you believe it's a better approach then you could try a altcoin with an inflationary rate that suits you. 
Fiat is Latin for 'by decree' - i.e state issued currency has value because the state declared it to be so. Well I don't see why in this enlightened age a currency can't have value 'by consensus', or because enough people believe it to be so. Seems more......democratic. Inflation is a separate issue. Besides BTC is inflationary. I guess just not inflationary enough for you.....

If we're talking complete government bankruptcy and the collapse of the state, I'll concede that my job is in trouble. But I was talking about a recession, not a complete collapse of the organs of the state as we enter a free market capitalist u(dys?)topia. Hopefully, either way maths teachers will still be in high demand.

Well I've been here for about four and a half years now and I really don't think that much has changed. We used to worry about Ghash mining pool having greater than 50% of the hashrate, now we worry about bitmain having 50% of the hashrate. We used to worry about governments banning bitcoin. We still worry about governments banning bitcoin. We used to celebrate ATH with morpheus and 300 meme's. Now we use some Japanese anime thingy and the rollercoaster dude. There's always been a huge amount of trolls/disinfo/whinging. But also some total hero's trudging on with the code, improving and enhancing the protocol. Follow those people if you want to see the best in the community, and join us on the lightning network.

This is called arbitrage and it creates efficient markets. People have bots running so as soon as a price differential opens up between one exchange and another, you buy on the cheaper one and sell on the more expensive. Besides, if you're going to dump, you don't dump it all on one illiquid exchange. You spread it across all the exchanges to get better liquidity and a better price. All the big and medium sized traders and miners will have accounts across the major exchanges. This happens in every market, not just cryptocurrency markets.

To be fair, bitcoin core developers had given up their time and energy to work on a product which happened to be the bread and butter of coinbase business model. How much did coinbase spend that year helping to develop the protocol. Hard to believe but it was zero. That's right. The biggest exchange was putting zero into protocol development and then acted with surprise that their point of view was not taken seriously by the very same people developing the protocol.

Try using the lightning network. Learn about the fees which each node charges to shunt coins around the open channels. Directly compete with the hub nodes for these fees if you like. But bear in mind that the opening of every channel requires a transaction onchain which obviously pays the standard fee to miners. 
This sounds like a win for miners, users, decentralisation and scalability to me.

I'm loving it, really good fun setting it up. If anyone can help me better understand the 'list funds' output that would be handy.

Currently, hash functions which have 256 bits of security with a classical computer are believed to have 128 bits of security on a quantum computer, which is still pretty good security. And as the poster below points out, its actually a double hash - SHA256 then RIPEMD-160.

I disagree with this point regarding the government. They may well try and force you to use it, but at the end of the day everyone uses fiat currently because they believe it will be accepted everywhere. I'll give you an example to make the point. If you take a fifty pound note onto a bus, the bus driver will almost certainly refuse to take it - yet its legal tender. People take what they think they can safely exchange later, the government doesn't really come in their decision making process.

You need to understand the lightning network before you decide its unworkable. I think your understanding of KYC AML laws is sketchy at best as well. 
In answer to your first question - yes they are, when you open and close channels. 
In answer to your second question, the off chain transactions happen in between the channels being open and closed. The point is indeed to allow micropayments to happen without clogging up the main chain. 
With regard to the points made in your third and fifth paragraph all I will say is 'welcome to bitcoin', no permission is needed to send or receive funds here. AML and KYC are only applicable when fiat is exchanged for crypto - i.e at the exchanges. You are well within your rights to sell socks to an individual anonymously receiving payment in btc.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:57:21

Anyone who writes code for a protocol will influence outcomes. If you want to contribute to the code, you can as its open source. If you don't want to or can't, once again that's on you.  
With regard to AML and KYC, I really can't answer that question as we don't know yet if or how regulators will treat the LN. But remember its designed for micropayments and every single channel which is opened and closed is recorded on the bitcoin blockchain. I very much doubt that any AML or KYC will be required outside of what is already required by exchanges in the countries that they operate. You seem to be implying that every transaction that takes place requires AML and KYC and that's not true if you're - for example - selling alpaca socks on the lightning network. 
The best way to investigate all of this is to set up your own node and play around with it, buying and selling on lightning. You'll have great fun and I'm pretty sure you'll quickly realise that it is decentralised and almost impossible to shut down.

If I follow your logic correctly, you're suggesting there is some kind critical number of people who need to be underwater with their crypto investment and then the whole ship will sink. I would counter with the point that the stock market didn't disappear after the great depression. But those who invested recklessly believing it to be without risk learnt an important lesson. 
And I agree with you that of course this affects bitcoin. My argument is that the bitcoin price was inflated by altcoin speculation and is now deflating as punters recognise they've bought into scams and hype. 
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:55:57
Ok so you can find the tax justice network [here]( They argue against corporate tax havens and for greater transparency in the tax system so that - for example - the very small online business that I run on my own - doesn't pay more tax *in real terms* than facebook does (which was the case in 2015 where facebook's corp tax in the UK was £4327 and my business paid about £5k). I agree with your suggestion that people should be given greater control over how their money is spent through taxes as its completely obvious to almost anyone that a good deal is squandered thanks to a central decision making process. I also support the view that the individual - not the state - is in the best position to solve many of our problems, but not all of them.

Most shops reject 50's even when they have change, because of the danger the note is fake. The point is that people don't worry about what the government tells them (50's are legal tender) and make their own choices as to what can be used as currency.

How profitable mining is depends entirely on how expensive electricity is where you live. For the vast majority of smaller miners, mining bitcoin is simply too expensive to be profitable so they end up mining obscure altcoins instead and hope to shift them at the top of a pump.

Let's say you want to exclude some sources. All private keys in bitcoin can be thought of as numbers from 1 to 2^(160). Start with 1. Take the hash of the private key. Now exclude that source. Lets say you can calculate a million of these every second on your computer. And you have 1000 computers. It will still take you 1.46x10^(39) seconds = 4.63x10^(31) years. Our universe is believed to be about 15 billion years old (I think?). So you'd need about 4x10^(21) lifecycles of our current universe to count them all.

So firstly it's designed for microtransactions. But secondly, if you directly open a channel up with 300 dollars it will work straight away. Or at least my forty dollar transaction did the other day. But this is of course missing the point of lightning. It's useful for small regular transactions with the same merchants. You only pay the transaction fee once, which currently on mainnet is very very cheap anyway...
I've also completely ignored the fact that the probability will increase as more of us are comfortable leaving 0.1 btc on there.....

We already have postal voting in my country under the paper system, and its widely believed to be exploitable and exploited for the very reasons that you criticise mobile phone voting. On the upside though, there are many voters who cannot make the journey to a polling station due to ill health or just the journey length. Its a tricky problem which doesn't have any easy answers. You allow voting outside of voting booths, you open yourself up to the criticisms you raised. On the other hand, if you don't allow it, you'll have fewer votes and you'll be disenfranchising a section of the electorate. These aren't simple problems with easy answers and they exist regardless of whether you use a paper, electronic or blockchain based system. 
With regard to the last point, I strongly believe that blockchain voting will increase transparency and security with regards to the final outcome; if we anchor the voting into the main chain then we can have strong cryptographic proof that the result is as stated and it will be relatively straightforward for anyone to check that their vote was counted for the right candidate.

Its a tricky chicken and egg problem that will only be resolved with pressure (on fiat currencies and their inflated value) and time (spending habits change very slowly - look how long cheques have stuck around). But I like to support the protocol by spending in places which have decided to accept bitcoin. Only today I bought a rug from [ and they were decent enough to give me a 25% discount for using btc. Full credit to the merchants here, all I did was take advantage of the discount. I think its deals like this which are very persuasive when it comes to using bitcoin. But you need true believers, and they're comparatively rare. Most people just want convenience.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:28:44
Whilst I agree with the sentiment of much that you've written on a personal level, I don't worry about other people investing in bitcoin 'for the wrong reasons'. Its not really for me to say how others should invest their money - and I suspect that the more they learn about it, the more they'll recognise why its a huge improvement on the current model. I don't think its a bad strategy to sell 10% of your remaining holdings either, every time it goes up x10 or whichever multiplier you choose. 
But I think its also crucial that if you are a true believer you should use bitcoin as it was intended, and spend them wherever they're accepted. The ecosystem needs users more than it needs hodlers. Least that's my take on it.

I agree I couldn't possibly claim that Marx was solely responsible for this. But I can point to the paragraphs where he argues strongly in favour of both of these ideas. Most people would happily accept that both of the ideas above are socialist in their essence - you might want to try and distinguish socialism and marxism, but I think its fair to say that most socialists regard Marx as a key influence on their thinking. To divide countries up as 'capitalist' or 'socialist' is quite arbitrary anyway. I think education of the poor was originally handled by churches and those who weren't 'lucky' went straight to the factories anyway. Its interesting stuff. 
I heard that one of the original arguments against teaching the poor was that they might become rebellious and revolt against their overlords. Some things never change. I think this was all Marx really wanted to say.

For your purposes, download an easy to use wallet from the app store on your phone. There are loads to choose from - personally i like eclair. After youve set up the wallet WRITE DOWN THE SEED. Think of the seed as your bitcoins. If i know your seed then i can spend your coins. 
Then sign up to a big exchange like coinbase. Buy a small amount at first and try and send it to your phone. Hey presto.....you're all set.

To take the opposing side of the 'bitmex is evil' argument and play devil's advocate: Miners take short positions to hedge their exposure to the price falling. Futures markets originally developed to help shield farmers from grain price volatility. The opportunity to go long or short helps the market establish more efficient price discovery thanks to greater liquidity.

I think its narrow minded to pidgeon hole people as 'capitalist', 'statist', 'socialist' 'anarchist' etc etc. The vast majority of us enjoy the fruits of all of these ideas, even though some exist clearly in a state of tension with each other. I think its pretty obvious though that the original invention was developed to give everyone an alternative to fiat money and modern banking. You've only got to read the genesis block to see that. With regards to patents, well initially you need everyone mining to bootstrap it to success. And you need developers helping you to create the system. There's no way the patent approach would have worked here. No one would have been interested. The whole point was to develop an open and permissionless ledger......

Hey nulsec, I pretty much agree with a lot of what you've written here, so its nice to find some common ground. Every government, even the most tyrannical, has some degree of decentralisation since one powerful person still needs a lot of allies to run a country. Its the natural way of things. I also agree that fiat currency really only attains value through consensus; I think the consensus currently in Venezuela or Zimbabwe is they'd rather be holding anything other than their national currencies! 
But this only supports the argument for bitcoin in my view. People will only use it if it has some kind of advantage over what they currently use. It's no secret that it gained traction mainly through drug markets online, because these people were at that time very likely to have their transactions restricted and censored by the government. Now you can argue about the rights and wrongs of drugs, but the fact remains that it was useful at the time for those people. So they used it. 
This will continue to be the case. Why is mining bitcoin popular in Venezuela at the moment? Because electricity is cheap and their national currency is weak. So bitcoin offers an advantage over the current system. 
What other advantages can bitcoin offer? Well you can't censor it, you can send it anywhere quite quickly (and hopefully soon almost instantly) and so it could become very useful to avoid capital controls. But lets say you think that's a very bad idea. That's also fine. Using bitcoin is a choice. If you think its immoral, don't use it - use something else. Maybe we're heading into a future in which the currency you choose to do business in is in some sense a political act. 
Finally, I'd just like to finish by saying bitcoin is far from perfect. Its changed a lot as well from something anyone can mine, to something only a very small subset of people can mine. I have high hopes though for the lightning network to have a very decentralising effect on the entire bitcoin ecosystem. The migration to layer two could be quite something. The last point I'd like to make is the leaderless aspect of bitcoin. For me, having no figurehead is a massive massive plus when comparing it to altcoins. We have no VB. We have a wide selection of developers who rarely agree on anything and as a result, we have checks and balances built in. I don't really see that either with fiat, or any altcoins. That's my take on it. I don't see a dystopia, only a future where people have a lot more choice.

Ok so if you have the seed phrase you don't need the password. The seed phrase is your 'private key' in a different form. The password is an extra bit of protection that you put on the wallet just in case someone has physical access to your computer. So you've got the seed phrase? Then simply go to restore wallet and 'i have a seed phrase' and you won't be prompted for a password.
Edit: to be a bit more precise, open electrum, go to 'file', 'new/restore', 'next', standard wallet, I already have a seed. Then type it in. Best of luck!

You can buy a hardware wallet if you like - they're very secure.

Or you can set up a paper wallet if you prefer. Just keep your private keys offline, that's the tricky - but by no means impossible - part.

As I understand it, this has more to do with the random process that is finding a block. The block times vary. The greater time between blocks, the more likely they are to be full, but the converse is also true.

You sound genuine and I'm guessing you're the same Darren who wrote the article so I'll give you an honest appraisal. What turned me off about the article is that its 100% focused on technical indicators, leaving out completely any mention of macro events that are likely behind the surge (and most recent drop) in price for the last three months. If you're a regular day trader you may well be interested in strict TA analysis, but I'd expect a bit more of a glance at fundamentals in a national newspaper. Why not mention the trade war, currency weakness in various countries, brexit, bitmex and finex legal troubles, recent movement of stolen coins and other relevant events? I would also love to see some discussion of adoption indicators like transaction volume, wallet downloads and coin distribution to give a better picture of how widely used bitcoin is becoming. And finally lets look at what events in the near future might drive the price (up or down). China introducing the digital Renminbi, Libra, ETF or no ETF, the halvening etc etc etc.
It just strikes me that the average express reader mulling over the business and finance section is unlikely to be interested in an article which is solely focused on technical indicators on a bitcoin candlestick graph. Surely they will want to know about the important events that drive the price?
Incidentally, I'm currently reading the coin rivet website and I'm really enjoying the article about Nigel Greene's comments on HMRC's approach to crypto. It seems like a very good website - I think you're better off leaving the 100% TA articles on there for those who are interested, but using articles with more discussion about the reasons behind price movements for the national press. Just my two cents.

I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that your confusion stems from a misunderstanding between the normal distribution and the poisson distribution.

And as the old saying goes 'you wait ages for a bus and then three come along at once'. This is typical of poisson processes.

Blockstream is a company which happens to employ a lot of the **voluntary** contributors to the bitcoin github. It's run by Adam Back, one of very very few people to be named in the bitcoin whitepaper, because he is given credit for developing hashcash - an idea which led to bitcoin's creation. These are facts, not opinions and they lead most reasonable people to conclude that blockstream is one of the very few companies that want to keep bitcoin open, decentralised and censorship resistant.

Positives: 
Instant counting. 
Allows people to see that they're vote has been counted on the 'right' side of the vote.
Allows for people to vote from home, avoiding intimidation. 
Prevents ballot stuffing and changing the final outcome after the count. Greater transparency. 
Negatives: 
People will need some kind of private key/password to vote. What happens if they lose it/sell it/give it away? 
Possible hacking of mobiles etc etc.

Fair points. In the uk we have the 'electoral register' where each household declared how many people of voting age lived in the house.

One of the biggest reasons address 'reuse' is not recommended is because when your spend from an address (note - not when you receive) you reveal the public key associated with that address. When you receive funds your public key is not exposed. 
Note that while you can think of your public key as your address, actually they're not the same thing. Your address is a hash of your public key. So if you've never spent from an address and some kind of quantum computing starts breaking encryption, you're in a much better position than if you have spent from that address.

I'm no Marxist myself either. To me the comparison felt slightly out of place, purely because I see bitcoin primarily as a technical achievement rather than a political one.

I just wanted to make the case that not all of the ideas in Das Kapital are worth disregarding purely because they are the ideas of Marx. The value of an idea should be judged solely on its own merit. 
Politically, bitcoin has much more in common with political philosophers who distrust the state: not Hobbs or Marx, but maybe Bakunin or even Rousseau.

Borrowing is necessary for economies to function. But national debt isn't 'borrowing' in the standard meaning of the term. If almost every government has a national debt, then who do they owe that money to? The answer is the central banks and really 'borrowing' isn't really a good description of what's going on. 'Credit expansion', or even just 'printing money' would be more fitting. I know you love the inflationary model and as I've argued before - that's fine - keep using it if you have no problem holding currency which is losing its purchasing power.

I will concede that I was being a tad facetious so apologies for that. But what is wrong with doing a job for a brief amount of time when you're younger and then moving on to something else? I did all kinds of jobs when I was younger (sadly no porn or bar work, despite being an avid consumer of both) and now I work in a completely unrelated industry. In my humble opinion its not up to me to tell others which jobs are and aren't acceptable to perform. Younger people tend to live without carefully planning for their retirement, for quite obvious reasons. Let them be.

Using an online 'web wallet' is widely discouraged - you don't control the keys and if you lose the password - well its similar to losing a password for an exchange - a pain in the arse which I am sadly very familiar with. Download electrum (preferably on a computer with a fresh linux install - but that's for the ultra paranoid) and write down (and never ever lose) the seed. Send your bitcoins to this wallet. You can also encrypt the wallet with a password, which you'll want to write down as well. But that is in no way as important as the seed, which you should think of as your bitcoins. Its your private key in a dozen words. 
Hope that makes sense and best of luck

@_date: 2019-08-25 10:26:03
I used to gamble (heavily) at the casino and bookies, and when I was younger even on fruit machines. Ever since I got into bitcoin I don't bother; anything I could win or lose at the casino is dwarfed by a 5% move in the bitcoin market, which naturally happens all the time (in both directions). The problem with gambling addicts is that they don't want to stop playing the game, regardless of how bad the losses (or winnings) are. This is kind of good news as a bitcoiner because I've managed to hold through 80% collapses in price a couple of times now. Its made me realise that I'm not even that concerned about the money. I'm fortunate enough to have a full time ultra secure recession proof job and a small business on the side which keeps my family looked after with croissants and beer and to be honest, that's enough for me to maintain a general cheeriness. I don't bother trading on the altcoin markets (as I think they're quite massively rigged) and I just hope that alternative currencies like bitcoin help to keep central bankers and governments honest, by giving people an alternative in times of deliberate currency devaluation.
So in answer to your question, yes, I see things differently now. I'm not even sure I care about getting rich any more. Its nice to have a healthy 'cushion' for a rainy day, but otherwise, I'm just here to watch the old system collapse from the comfort of my shed.

Ok so 21 billion is generally accepted to be 21,000,000,000 - although this is the US billion and in the UK (where I'm from) it used to work just as it seems to in Spain - but nowadays, if we talk about billioniares, we mean '1000 million aires' if you get what I'm saying?  Regardless, 1 million per bitcoin would put the current market cap at 21,000,000,000,000 (generally accepted as 21 trillion nowadays thanks to our friends in the states). 
  
To put things into perspective, the current market cap of gold is about 5 or 6 trillion dollars I believe. To my mind, market cap of gold is a good target for long term success. Its much easier to transfer and far easier to hold and secure. But that's just my opinion; we shall see where this rollercoaster takes us.

My quick guide:
download the latest electrum version from the official website, make sure its up to date and preferably check the sigs. Put this on a fresh mem stick. Now you'll need two computers, one offline and one online. Using the mem stick, install electrum on both computers. Then on the offline one, create a wallet and copy and paste the master public key into a file and save it. Then on the online computer, use electrum to set up a 'watch-only' wallet. Use the master public key from the mem stick when asked. Now you have a cold wallet with private key which hasn't touched the internet, and a 'watching wallet' on your online computer.
Ok making a transaction:
On the online computer, go to send and stick in the details as normal, then preview and 'export'. Export the unsigned transaction on the mem stick and plug that in to the offline computer. Open electrum and go to 'tools', load transaction 'from file' and select the file you need. It will then produce a signed transaction. You can then move it back across to the online computer and broadcast the signed transaction using preview again and broadcast. Note that the signed transaction does not expose your private key.
I'm not brilliant at explaining things but I hope that helps. Just try it with a small amount first, get comfortable with the process and yes, as you say, use a fresh mem stick and preferably keep your online computer clear of viruses anyway. Don't download gigabytes of random files on torrent websites or click weird links from emails. Other than that. Good luck!

Personally I think its good to occasionally move the coins - not because they're insecure, but just so I understand clearly how to recover them. There are lots of different wallets out there nowadays but a paper wallet generated randomly (Not Brain wallet!) from bitaddress is fine. If you do want to access your fork coins though you will absolutely need to move them. Worth it for a 20% increase if you ask me. But I totally understand if you want to keep them there. Make sure you still have that private key though!

I actually agree with almost everything you say - but those 2 histories of transactions will be identical for all coins that existed prior to the fork. So regular users will not have two different balances. In the end the chain which has fewer miners mining on it will become deserted, as exchanges will not convert thise coins to fiat. No relationship between the blockchains is required.

Its a brute forcer for all wallet passwords - I used it ages ago to brute force my brother's multibit wallet after he forgot the password. I'm not a developer or anything like that, but you got to be prepared to cut and paste and learn some basic stuff. I quite enjoyed it as my background is in maths so it was quite fun to visit the topic of permutations and combinations again.
Note that this tool is ONLY useful if you have a reasonable idea what the password might have been. So in my case my brother used 3 different possible words with some numbers possibly at the start or end. Maybe with some capitals. This programme is perfect if you're in that situation and you're patient. Otherwise wallet recovery services will do it for you - but for 20%
Here's the tool.

At the time I was using localbitcoins which charges a fee to withdraw. Its not a problem for one trade but if you're doing it everyday, it starts to eat into profits. The exchanges where its free to withdraw (bitstamp for example) tend to have higher trading fees anyway so its swings and roundabouts. 
It mitigates against some risk when you withdraw but anyone who is actively trading is unlikely to fiddle around with their position at the end of every day; its a risk of course, but that's the life of a trader for you. We need the traders as well. I don't think we'll have much success onboarding merchants without traders supplying liquidity to the exchanges they use. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:51:45

I used electron cash but please please please move those bitcoins onto another paper wallet first. That's basic security. Then use electron cash to import the private keys (I think they allow sweeping or importing). 
By the way. There are two other free coins for btc holders. Bitcoin gold (roughly two or three percent) and if its worth it, bitcore (probably not worth it unless you hold a lot of bitcoin). Oh and clams if you've been holding since 2014 but thats also hardly worth it.

Ok firstly well done on getting the private keys from multibit hd as that in itself is quite some achievement. Firstly lets check that the coins are there on the block explorer. Using block chair for bitcoin cash explorer (easy to find on google) start copying and pasting all those addresses (not private keys! Should be about 30) into the explorer so you can find out which addresses have bch in them. 
Next we come to an important subtlety. Sweeping keys is not the same as importing keys and it might be wise to try a different wallet from coinomi. Or we might just need the compressed version of the private key. We can do that using bitaddress. First check which addresses have bch using the block explorer. Im back home in about 4 hours so will respond then.

Every single transaction I have made in the past year (and there have been many) has confirmed in the next block except one, which I deliberately sent with a very low fee (less than 50 cents). The fee I normally pay is one third of what you just paid. 
Basically if you want to avoid what has just happened to you, don't send any bitcoins when the mempool is being spammed. Or you could just use an altcoin like bch if you prefer. No one accepts it for payment, but its really cheap to send!

Firstly I'd like to start by confessing that I'm not a cryptographer or a programmer - so I might well be wrong - and secondly by stating that there really is no shame in being misinformed. 
But from what I understand, all coins mined before the forks will exist in both blockchains - so yes, in that sense you're right, they will be doubled. But. But but but. Once one chain becomes dominant, (and it makes sense from a game theoretic perspective that one chain has to become dominant, and quickly too!) the other chain will wither and die. This will not affect someone who has spent coins during the fork. They will be spent on both networks. Bog standard users really are very unlikely to be affected in any way. 
If I am wrong, please enlighten me.

The traders are as much a part of the ecosystem as the miners merchants hodlers and developers. Everytime you buy bitcoin you have a day trader to thank for the liquidity. Im not denying that hodlers realise the same if not more gains than daytraders.

Ok first get a clean email addy. One not connected to you in any way. I'd suggest proton mail. There are lots of ways of buying bitcoins anonymously (cash buy on local bitcoins or through someone you know - or I've even heard of people trading OTC with miners) but I think the easiest way is to buy them on a standard exchange (in your own name if you like) then sign up to a crap altcoin exchange with no kyc and use that clean email from earlier. Send them your bitcoins (which are still tainted with your name). Then trade btc-&gt;xmr-&gt;zcash-&gt;btc. Money laundered. 
For the uber paranoid, use two altcoin exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:28:13
You can only say 'its more profitable currently to mine bch' if you immediately dump your coins. But is it not the case that mining rewards are locked in for a specified number of blocks (can't remember how many) so its impossible to dump straight away. And besides, miners often hold back coins to try and time their sell better. 
What I guess I'm trying to say is that miners have to take at least a medium term, if not a long term view of the price - and so they have to look at the long term viability of the coin.

Yes nothing wrong with coinomi so you could try that. I know from experience that sometimes the wallet seed will not work in other wallets, but if it doesn't work it will just tell you. 
I think my posts are being removed when I mention the fork coin, might be wise to use the direct message feature from now on. 
If the seed doesn't work in coinomi, we'll have to try using the private keys. But give it a go and cross your fingers. Coinomi are trustworthy, just make sure you're not downloading from a phishing site. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:18:12
You can look at this in two equally valid but contradictory ways. Firstly, as you point out, any short sell must eventually be settled which guarantees buying pressure. But alternatively, you could look at it as 'fewer people are betting that the price will go down', which could also be interpreted as bullish....
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:06:17
If you didnt put a password on the wallet, or you did and you still know it, youre fine. Job one is open the wallet and write down that seed phrase.

Yeah basically the private key is everything. I've always found it counterintuitive but there is not 'bitcoin file' if you know what I mean. There is only the private key; whoever has access to that has access to the coins, regardless of the wallet, files or anything else. Don't do what I did though and just save an encrypted private key, thinking it was a normal private key (should start with a 5 or a 1 ..... I think.... make sure yours does). Took me ages to get that money back. 
Yeah I agree with the fees. If it really doesn't matter when it confirms try using the cheapest setting on the wallet and wait till [this mempool graph]( doesn't show a spike! I do the same thing actually. If it doesn't go through because your fee was too low its not a problem. The coins magically appear back there after a couple of days. 
Best of luck.

I think the fork was on that day. Are you sure that you didn't transfer them before the fork took place? 
edit: check that the transaction was after block 478558 on a block explorer. Then all you need is the private key exported from your multibit wallet. Import that private key into something like electron cash and you're good to go.
edit 2: if you have the old public address just look them up on a bitcoin cash block explorer like this [one](

A very rational take on the situation - not hyping but just trying to understand what's going on. Consensus as Lloyd calls it is what for me is the most interesting aspect of crypto-currency. A theory of value which essentially argues that if a sizeable number of people hold something to be valuable, then that object has the worth it is ascribed. Forget intrinsic value - its a mirage.

Yeah its really interesting and humbling learning about it all.

I borrowed some program [here]( which helped me bruteforce the solution (since I had an idea what the password probably was). Learnt loads of new stuff and I'm totally hooked now. 
Like you, I find the whole system fascinating and there's so many helpful people if (when!) you get stuck figuring some of it out. Anyway all the best for the future - I plan on holding till the next halving (year 2020) cause that's when I see btc approaching gold market cap.

I'm a pretty good reverse indicator of the trend so you might well have taken the right course of action. Long term I'm very bullish for the prospects but it seems to me that most of the issues that drive the price down are quite human rather than technical. Greed and corruption with Gox, theft through social engineering during the bitstamp hack, and now developers who cannot find common ground and just retreat into their entrenched positions. Its sad as I respect all of their contributions to the project. But I'm sure this will all blow over, possibly before January too, but until then I'll be waiting and possibly trying to catch that falling knife.

Yeah so the idea is, that bitcoin cash exists in that wallet address but on a separate chain. If you send your bitcoins to another paper wallet, it won't move on the bitcoin cash chain because they have a different blockchain with different miners (and replay protection). But yeah, the long and the short of it is if you send that to a new wallet, then use the private keys from your old wallet, the most you risk losing is your bitcoin cash. Not your bitcoins.

It certainly did go ahead - check out how much one of those is worth on [coinmarketcap]( I seem to recall it being a bit more of a fiddle to get them but its 1:1 again so well worth having. The bitcore thingy is only 0.5:1 ratio and they're only worth 30 bucks. If you've held since 2014 you'll have some free clams too but probably not that many. 
On multibit once its running go to tools-&gt;export private keys-&gt;and export them to a file and keep that safe. Then you're going to use those private keys when you download electron cash or some other bitcoin cash wallet. Do the bch first (as its worth more) and think about the gold afterwards. 
Let me know if you get stuck.

The more I look into this, the more it looks likely that multibit hd is an absolute bitch for compatibility and doesn't seem to have a simple way to access the private keys. You might have to use that Ian Coleman webpage where you feel a bit sketchy entering the seed into a webpage. You can save the page though and do the entire process offline so there's no real way they can get your keys. 
Here's a nice write up on how to do it. Its a bit technical but once you have all your addresses and all your private keys, well only then can you start importing them to the bitcoin cash wallet.
Go to 
In your browser, select file save-as, and save this page as a file.
Double-click that file to open it in a browser on any offline computer. 
In the field "BIP39 Mnemonic" fill in your 12 wallet generation words

Derivation path FOR INTERNAL (CHANGE) ADDRESSES (copy paste this): m/0'/1
Your change addresses are now displayed at the end of the page. 
Now save all those addresses with their associated private keys. 
By all means use coinomi. They're bound to have an 'import private key option'. And you can use bit address to turn your private key into a qr code to make the transfer simple enough. Good luck!

The logic is simply that the market is currently absorbing roughly 18,000,000 dollars worth of fresh bitcoin per day, which will halve to 9 million post halving.

Seems like quite a sensible post. It assumes several things that may or may not be true. Firstly that all miners sell all their coins immediately for dollars. If you look at the past 7 years, that would be a pretty poor strategy for miners. 
But my second point would be that 13 billion isn't as much as it sounds. Lets say that there are just 5 million people using bitcoin today. 13 billion / 5 million = 2600 dollars each. Provided that that is the average amount each individual invests over the next three years, we've maintained that price.

I think you need [this]( Its an open source tool to decrypt encrypted private keys from a variety of bitcoin wallets, including bitcoin-qt. If I was you I wouldn't bother downloading the blockchain. I'd use a lite client which will import private keys from bitcoin-qt (most will - electrum for example). 
But first you need to decrypt the wallet.dat file. That is what btcrecover will help you do. Its completely legit and you can run it offline so you haven't got to worry. Read through the very long instructions (well worth it - its tricky in parts but if I can understand it, you can understand it) and just keep trying. If you basically know the password, you will crack it. 
Best of luck dude.

Well I guess my point is that you can't just control a market because you have a lot of money, unless its moving the market upwards. 
Take fine art. Can wall street short the fine art market and send prices plummeting? Not without buying a shit load of the stuff and sending the price rocketing first. Then selling. The fine art market is immune to paper shorts. The gold market would be as well if it wasn't for the fact that banks hold a lot of gold, so they can pretty much guarantee delivery if a trade goes wrong. Basically the gold market is horrendously over-valued. That spike to 1900 dollars a few years back is probably as good as it was ever going to get.

Sounds like you've got it all sorted out. Good lad! If you ever doubt what your wallet tells you is in your wallet (electrum is great, I'm sure its correct) well why not check your public address on a [block explorer]( This should show the same amount as your wallet, as well as the number of confirmations and other interesting stuff. 
Oh and multibit when I used it (years ago) never had seed words. And if yours did they may not have been compatible with bip 39 electrum seeds. So import the private key and your good. 
One thing though, if you ever 'restore' this wallet using a seed, you will NOT have the coins which you just sent there. Its not a major deal as you have the multibit private key. Keep that safe along with your seed. 
All the best

Yes there is a wallet. Here's the [link]( to the one I used - windows installer. Take the obvious precautions. Had to use importprivkey on like 30 electrum addresses. This fork only pays out 50% of what you had on November 2nd. Still at 0.5% - it was a cheeky bit of cash for Christmas presents. 
As far as bitcoin gold goes, I used hitbtc but I was waiting for ages to do it pretty much as soon as it launched and had a blockchain. Have they shutdown deposits or something?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:08:21
Hmmmm - Ok if you moved it on August the 2nd it really will be in the multibit hd addresses. But you should have loads of addresses to try - like about 30. MOST should be empty (because they were never used) but a few should have the bch in them. Did you try all of the addresses? 
And just another reminder, don't type the private keys in there. 
My main question is, with the addresses and private keys that you found, how many were there? About 30? Another very important question. Do your private keys start with a 5 (Wallet import format) or K or L (compressed)? 
Ohhh I just thought of something. When you used the Ian Coleman webpage to get the private keys, you did get the change addresses as well I hope. As that is where (I suspect) the money is. The external receiving addresses probably don't have the money. That could be the problem if you've tried all the wallet addresses. 
Blasted change addresses. 
Let me know how you get on. Sorry this is proving such a nightmare. I blame multibit and its horrendous compatibility problems.

I expect miners each have their own individual strategies when it comes to the halving. One possible approach could be to sell all mined coins in the year prior to the event, so you have plenty of liquid fiat to keep you afloat for after the event where you'll be mining at a loss. Hold back any coins mined post halving until the price rises so you can force price upwards and sell them at true value.

Its been pretty straightforward buying bitcoin for at least six years now. It was probably easier back then in some ways because the only thing that flagged big trades was your bank account - never the exchange! Less KYC as well back then. But you don't need to go near bitcoin core to hold your private keys yourself. The easiest way is with a wallet like electrum (there are many others). Just write down those seed words and never ever lose them. 
Oh and sell that dgb on the next pump if you can. Those alts don't last forever. Don't take my word for it, just have a look at the historical record on coinmarketcap.

/Just in case you were unaware, cashing out a short position involves buying bitcoin at market rate. And in case you're still unaware, that causes the price to rise.  This is much more likely to be a long cashing out.
But I totally agree with your last point. Bitcoin needs to have practical use beyond bitmex speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:52:41
Ok so your 'bitcoins' are really just a record in a ledger which is shared by the miners. The only way to access a wallet on that ledger is by using a private key - which is a random number between 1 and 2^256. When you keep your bitcoins on an exchange they know that number and dont give it to you. Instead they give you a login. The long and short of it is if they get hacked, they lose your private key. 
If you keep your bitcoins on a wallet at home, all this really means is you generate and store your own private key. If you make sure you keep this private key offline (cold storage) then how can anyone 'hack' your bitcoins? Answer - they can't, without breaking into your house and stealing this key. Hence most would advise you to store offline in 'cold storage'. 
I'd advise the 'electrum' wallet for setting this up. Its really easy and you can just write down the seed words which is really the private key in disguise. Hope this makes sense. All the best

Yep. Older people get scammed, especially via the telephone - thats where the money is after all.

Every altcoin exchange does that - polo, trex, bitmex. Whenever the market goes crazy for one coin (like really crazy) the site crashes and margin traders start jumping off bridges. I'm afraid its absolutely one of the risks that must be accepted when trading crypto. Its a mixture of incompetency, insider market making and outright scams.

Programming is also an excellent choice, and with any science degree you'll find yourself doing plenty of mathematics anyway. With regards to the job at Mcdonalds, I think its commendable that you're earning money to become self-reliant. When you're young there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing those kinds of jobs which don't necessarily pay well but teach you something even more important - the value of hard work and money. 
With regards to programming languages, I'm sure that there will be all kinds of opinions as to what you should learn. But I don't think that its as important as *finding a language that you enjoy programming in* and using your own spare time to hone your skills. Hobbies are important in life. They focus your energies and give you a sense of purpose. Anyway best of luck to you regardless of what the future holds; I hope that you reach your target whatever it may be.

ok you'll still need your old multibit wallet because after a coin forks, the transaction that you send isn't sent on both forks. Hence the word 'fork'. So your bitcoin cash is still sitting in the address for the multibit wallet on the bch side of the fork. You still need the old multibit wallet, then you can grab the private key and use it in a bitcoin cash wallet. kapiche? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:15
Cool try that again. I'm 99% certain that the bch is somewhere in that multibit hd wallet. It just has to be. But try all your keepkey addresses as well. 
Also, this block explorer is better:
Its only going to show bch but it shows transaction received. Now those addresses in multibit hd definitely held bch prior to the fork (since prior to the fork, bch=btc) so they should show a transaction even if there is nothing in the wallet. My hunch is that we haven't got all the addresses from multibit hd yet. 
If you manage to find a few more addresses, the next step is using bitaddress.org (offline as you're going to input private keys - but its a very trustworthy website - been around for years) and it will spit out a few qr codes. When you first visit the website wave the mouse around for 30 seconds then click wallet details. Then input the private keys for the addresses which hold bch. Coinomi can then sweep these qr codes (you want the one on the bottom right) and hopefully it will turn up in coinomi. Hope that makes sense :) Good luck!

They can get away with it with gold because they actually own a lot of gold in the physical market with which they can 'guarantee delivery'. 
So an example. They 'sell' a paper contract of gold (not real gold - but a promise to deliver real gold) to a buyer. Naturally they are 'short' gold and think the price will go down (hence why they sold) but the buyer is long and thinks the price will go up (hence why they bought). If the unfortunate happens and the price of gold actually rises up - fast - then the buyer can insist on the delivery. Fortunately the bank has a lot of physical and can deliver the gold to the buyer. 
So the long and the short of it (pun intended) is that for hedge funds to pull the same trick on bitcoin, they will need to own a substantial percentage of bitcoins themselves. Good luck acquiring those bitcoins, they can have 90% of my personal coins for the modest price of my mortgage fully paid off. Do we have a deal?

Really pleased to hear you're getting close to those coins. You can certainly try the support from keep.key if you're having trouble, as they'll probably be able to help with much better instructions than myself! 
Regarding the bitcoin gold, I think you'll need the private keys for those - you'll have to get them from keepkey somehow. I can look into that for you if you like - then go to bit address and add them to the coinomi wallet using that little qr code in the bottom right hand corner. At least thats exactly how I did it with the private keys from my electrum wallet. I know its been a rough week for btg and bch so you might want to try and time your sell nicely. 
Anyways best of luck and let me know if you need any help.

I'm in two minds on the issue. Obviously some content curation is required if you want to avoid all kinds of horrible stuff being posted onto your platform, but if you're too overbearing then your censorship becomes political and your platform is no longer neutral. To be honest, i dont think its possible to be neutral when running an open video sharing platform. 
And just focusing on the issue of scammers, at what point does a scheme become a scam? Should we protect people from gambling - lotteries, scratchcards, etc etc. They exploit human weakness as much as any outright scam does, so should advertising any form of gambling become illegal? Fir me that would be the very definition of nanny state. There are no easy answers here IMHO.

Its pretty strange treating holding bitcoin and using bitcoin as mutually exclusive categories. This is only anecdotal, but ive held like a boss but also spent bitcoin on all sorts of things, most expensive being a volcano vape back in 2015. Its similar to the false distinction between 'traders' and 'investors', since once again i'll bet most of us do a bit of both. In summary, its not only possible but in fact very common to hold on to a large stash while occasionally spending some of it.

Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it. I followed the story as it developed last week and seemed to recall that the Samourai and Wasabi devs had some kind of argument a few months back - an argument which I have neither the time nor the expertise to engage with or take sides in. But as a user who has in the past approached privacy with something like btc -&gt;shiftyaltcoinexchangewithnokyc-&gt;monero-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;freshwallet, I was wondering if these new approaches were any better. I understand what you're saying about hops and fresh wallets, seems reasonable as if they flag for more than one hop they'll certainly take a lot of innocents with the guilty. Be interesting to see it play out.

I'm flabbergasted that they are in the keepkey. - You saw the full balance you were expecting? I make the block number 478558 for the fork, which is timestamped at [14:16]( so I presume the coins were sent around block 478606 (8 hours so 48 blocks later give or take..). Like you say. Twilight zone! 
But who cares I guess - If you've found them that's great. 
Ok so keepkey I'm not familiar with, but I've just had a little look and they released a 'beta-update' for bch support [here]( - you can force your keepkey to update if it hasn't happened automatically using the chrome extension app. Here are the [instructions](

I understand you're thinking but its not true to say there is a 1/600 chance of a block being found in a second. That assumes a uniform distribution across the first ten minutes which is not how poisson processes work. Intuitively it feels false as well, since surely a block can be found after ten minutes?

Why can't something similar happen with bitcoin? 
 
Its a good question and one well worth asking. First ask yourself what bitcoin private is, and how it differs from bitcoin. Despite them sounding very similar, they are in fact very different. BTCP is worth 60 cents per coin, has a 24 hour trading volume of 16,000 dollars (but bear in mind the vast majority of that will be fake wash trading), and its hashrate is extremely weak leading to a successful 51% attack last year by a whitehat hacker. As a result of these facts its also much easier for a few miners and devs to change the rules all of a sudden, burning lots of coins without your permission. 
Why is bitcoin different? Well bitcoin has been around far longer than any other cryptocurrency: its worth 5000 dollars per coin, has a 14 billion dollar 24 hour trading volume (probably also inflated, but no where near as much percentage wise as btcp) and its hashrate was more powerful than the worlds top 400 supercomputers 5 years ago. Its never been the victim of a successful 51% attack. Most importantly though, its very very very difficult to change the consensus rules and this is part of its design. Even if the top mining firms and many of the most important companies involved wanted to change the rules, they couldn't - this actually happened a couple of years ago with the brouhaha over the blocksize increase. Even the most powerful actors within the system can't change the rules to suit themselves. 
So in summary, accept no imitations. Bitcoin is the only coin worth holding.

Ok this is strange. Could you just confirm that you downloaded your updated version directly from the official electrum.org website, as there was a very nasty virus which had a pop up to update on some old versions of electrum. I'm sure you're fine though. Also can you copy and paste the exact phrase of the error, and also what does the wallet show balance wise (0.00 im guessing). Have you tried the addresses tab or the coins tab on view? I just want to understand exactly what electrum is saying to you after you input the seed.
By the way you're right with the seed, it uses a check digit (or word) to ensure you've typed it in correctly so I'm sure you did that right.

Easiest way is providing the one you trust the most with access to the 'seed' words for your wallet. Then you can point them in the direction of someone else you know (and trust) who has the technical know how to use the seed words to access the coins.

Time between blocks can be modelled by a negative exponential distribution (I think - as block times are a poisson process). So if my maths isn't off today (it regularly is) then the probability of a block being mined in 30 seconds is given by:
1-e\^(-0.1x0.5)=0.049 (2sf)

Great answer and great link. The exact probability for not finding a block for at least one hour is 0.0024787 and according to my calcs this is expected to happen once every two to three days.
Edit: i should probably add how i worked this out. Blocks are found randomly and independently in a given unit of time so we're dealing with a poisson probability distribution. You can use this to find the probability of n blocks occuring in a given time interval. If on the other hand you require the probability of finding a block in a given time interval, then you require the negative exponential distribution. Sorry i cant help you with the coding though, my background is in philosophy and maths.

Hmmmm. ICO's completely frozen up. Acknowledged wash trading a chronic problem for all the altcoins. Btc rallies fail to ignite interest in the biggest alts this time (see eth and xrp in the last two weeks). I'd say that the future of altcoins is looking fragile at best.

As the block subsidy gradually disappears the price of btc will rise and it will become more and more expensive to transact on the base layer. Fortunately we have layer two solutions so that plebs like you and I can still use btc cheaply and regularly. Block space, like bitcoins themselves, is a scarce resource.

Don't worry, I didn't have a clue how to do this for ages and ages. Basically it breaks down like this. Get a computer which you don't really need anymore - a raspberry pi works great for this but an old phone or laptop will work too. The uber paranoid will tell you that you need a fresh linux install, but to be honest you don't need that unless mossad are trying to steal your bitcoins. Download electrum onto this computer and then NEVER EVER go online with it again. Now comes the clever bit. Set up an electrum wallet on the offline computer (yes it works fine offline). Note the master public key and receiving address, as well as the seed (obviously!) which should be written down and stored somewhere very safe. Now on your normal everyday online desktop computer, download electrum a second time (but on the new machine). Set up a 'watch only wallet' using the master public key. You can now keep an eye on your offline 'cold' wallet at all times. But the best part is when you want to spend from the cold wallet. You don't need to go online! Just use the 'watch only wallet' on your normal computer and attempt to send a transaction. You will be able to 'preview' it and export the transaction. Stick it on a fresh mem stick. Move this to the offline computer. Sign the transaction offline. Move the signed transaction back to the watch only and 'broadcast'. Thats the basic strategy. And it works beautifully. DM me if you need a hand at all. Just make sure you download electrum from the official site. All the best!

You make a fair point. Perhaps the block size limit will become a real problem sooner than we anticipate causing real trouble. I'm not sure what impact I could have trying to stop a decentralised currency being used by anyone who chooses to. Personally (this might upset a few people), I wonder if I coudn't just use an altcoin whilst the network was experiencing problems. Forgive my ignorance, but the lightning network seems to me to already exist in the form of a thousand altcoins. The value of bitcoin might swing a bit whilst the network struggled, but we're all used to that around here.

@_date: 2017-04-15 17:21:04
This is a common misunderstanding. The bitcoins are not a 'file' you might store on a machine. Rather, there is a ledger which all nodes have a copy of in the network. Somewhere written on that ledger is your public address and the bitcoins in it. Now the wallet software uses private keys which the network recognises as paired with the public address. This allows you to spend the bitcoins to another address on the ledger. 
As a result of this, its possible to send bitcoins to an address that has never even been online. Pretty amazing ey!

Ive personally bought lots of merch (mugs, beach towel, rug, stickers, posters etc etc) so i guess im your target market, but i would say theres a lot of stuff out there already in terms of merchants with similar ideas. Check out lightning network stores for a big list of merchants. Dont let me talk you out of it though. Just means you need some great merch. For example, as far as i can tell no one is selling alpaca socks on lightning yet. I mean, if that isnt textbook "market failure" then i dont know what is.....
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:16:45
Its called a change address. Everytime you send a transaction the whole balance of the original address gets sent (700 bucks by the sound of it) - 500 dollars to the address you wanted to send it to and 200 dollars to another address which your wallet controls but is not the original address. 
Basically bitcoin transactions always spend the whole of the original address, but just use another address for the change (which you control). Most wallets take care of change addresses 'under the hood' so its quite freaky when you first realise this!

Everyone starts like you - dipping their toes in first - When I first bought, I bought just a little, transferred it to my wallet at home and then transferred it to another wallet on my phone. Just to check I understood. In terms of common pitfalls: 
(a) the 'seed' and the 'password' are not the same thing. The seed is way more important than the password and to all extent and purposes, it is the key to your bitcoins and if anyone else has it they can spend your money without any fuss. Look after it. Still put a password on your wallet though. I mean extra security can't hurt. 
(b) use 2fa on all exchange accounts you have. All of them. 2fa is essentially a 'double password' (2 factor authentication) with one continuously changing on your phone. Internet banking also uses 2fa for the very good reason that it really works to keep hackers out of your accounts. 
(c) if you're keeping a lot of money in bitcoins, you really must use cold wallets. You don't need to be online to set up a wallet. So use an old cheap laptop which you never intend to plug back in to the internet, set up a wallet on that. Buy from an exchange and immediately send it to your cold wallet. Sit down. Open up a beer. Relax knowing that no one has a hope in hell of stealing your 75 dollars. 
Any questions, we really are a helpful community (mostly). Reach out to someone and they will help you.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:14:47
Ahh so I don't think the wallet you're trying to restore is actually opening, and so you're stuck on a default wallet without accessing the real deal. One thing puzzling me, if you're using a seed, you don't need a password as well. But you mentioned using a password. Why is that?
The advice peleion is giving sounds very good as well. This could be some weird file corruption or bug. Try uninstalling then reinstalling electrum. And remember with electrum you'll probably want to delete your old wallets as well.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:20:29
Take a deep breath first, I know panic is the immediate reaction when this kind of thing happens but its more likely that electrum hasn't synchronised yet. First question. What version of electrum are you using (It MUST be at least 3.3.\* or you risk using a scam wallet).
Edit: my immediate guess is you're using a very very old version of electrum which you desperately need to update.
Second edit: you can put your mind at rest if you know the bitcoin addresses and have used a block explorer. Whenever something like this happens to me (its happened lots of times) I look up the address on the block explorer and the coins are always where they should be.

The community is actually a very broad church. You have all kinds of people who use it for various practical or idealistic reasons, but most people who are genuinely interested in the principles behind it tend to be against any kind of government led approach to the control of the money supply. In this sense we are at odds with mainstream culture. In terms of interaction, I don't think its any different to any other sub-culture out there - social media channels (slack, irc as well) but also conferences and meetups exist - dark-net markets. I think the flavor of the community is very much in the tradition of other large open source projects like Linux. A huge amount of disagreement exists on issues which an outsider might describe as trivial or technically obscure, leading to many 'tribes within tribes'. Personally, I became a member after a buying a few years ago for ideological reasons and I'm sure I'll stay till the bitter end. Which I very much doubt will ever come - there will always be demand for 'cash', even when cash no longer exists.

Buying bitcoin is pretty straightforward. You can buy from a variety of solid exchanges depending on where you live on the planet (coinbase for US, europeans use bitstamp but there are loads of places to choose from). But the biggest thing you need to suss out is how to withdraw your coins to your own wallet and look after them yourself. If you leave them on the exchange, then you're trusting that exchange with your money which kind of defeats the point.
Start by downloading a wallet for your desktop (I'd suggest electrum) and go through the process of writing down the seed and everything. Once you've set it up post your address and I'll send you enough for a beer, and we'll go from there.....

DM me if you need a hand setting it up. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:21:32
That's also fair and I completely understand the frustration with many of the exchanges. I actually like the approach that companies like localbitcoins have taken since you won't have to worry about some 'market maker' negotiating zero fee trading for himself and perhaps even getting privileged access to the order book. I wouldn't object to some sort of regulation that protects investors on some exchanges, but I think we need to also self regulate and insist on more transparency with regards to solvency and order book clarity. We'll see how things like lightning and atomic swaps can help in this area.

You need btcrecover which is a bit of software written by christopher gurnee on github. You can crack it yourself offline provided you have either

(b) you used a very short password and have no idea what it was. 
It could take you a while but contrary to what you might think, you don't have to be a technical genius to pull this off. If I can do it, everyone can.

If all you want to do is buy some bitcoin and hold on to it, you really don't need to pay someone for advice on how to do that, or spend ages trying to find out how its done. Just buy from a simple exchange, transfer it to a well known wallet (electrum or bread wallet or whatever really) and write down the seed and keep it safe. 
Thats it.

Research ''transaction batching'' and then write three long paragraphs about that. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:42:33
You can buy from lots of different places but if you live in the US, coinbase is probably the easiest place (I'm guessing - I live in the UK). Or just use one of the big exchanges like bitfinex, bitstamp etc etc. Personally I use localbitcoins myself. 
In terms of storage, always take your coins off an exchange and send them to yourself. Probably the easiest relatively safe and simple way to store coins would be to use an old phone/laptop. Download electrum wallet and send the coins to that address. Then keep that old phone/laptop perpetually offline. You can set up a 'watch only wallet' on your proper online computer so you can keep an eye on your coins without any real risk. Its not perfect this method but its pretty secure. Just make sure you note down the seed phrase and keep it safe. Hope that helps and best of luck.

Hehehehe. Thanks man. 
So whilst there are differences between ECDSA and AES, the critical difference here is that a password which you come up with is......NOT RANDOM. Whereas a bitcoin private key should always always always be generated randomly. This is why brain wallets were cracked really rather quickly once people started using them four or so years ago. This was using ECDSA. 
So the situation the author of this thread is dealing with is this: his randomly generated bitcoin private key was encrypted with a NON RANDOM password which can be used to decrypt the encrypted string he has and find his private key. He also claims to have a very good idea what that password was. Lets say the password was 123456Test. But he thinks the password is 123456test. Well with 96 possible characters on a standard keyboard (call it 100 for simplicity) and using a 'try each character one by one to see if I've made a typo' he would only have to try 100+100+........+100=1000 possible combinations. A lame desktop could do this in less than a second. 
The situation you're describing is trying to bruteforce a bitcoin private key from nothing. That is indeed an intractable problem. A bitcoin key is essentially a RANDOM number between 1 and 2^256. Since we have no way to narrow down the sample space, we have to try every single possible combination. That will indeed take 2^256 /1,000,000 seconds = 1.15x 10^71 seconds=3x 10^67  hours=3.7x 10^63  years. 
So quite a few. 
Are you starting to grasp the important difference between RANDOM and NON RANDOM strings?

Sorry for my initial harsh response. If it makes you feel any better, that btc address appears to have received 25btc today. So you probably weren't the only one to fall for this. This kind of scam is as old as the hills and yeah like you say - its based on greed which is a pretty powerful emotion. We all make mistakes, some of which are extremely expensive but look at it this way. You could have bought two guinea pigs and been told they're both female, only to find out one is in fact male. And then one of them is pregnant, and needs a c-section - which costs around 0.1btc (500 quid). That would have been a completely different mistake, but just as expensive. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:20:32
Not true. The difficulty depends on the length of the password and is considerably easier if you have a very good idea what the password is.

I'm not relying on 'Basic Computer Security for Dummies'. I'm relying on a script available [here]( which I successfully used to brute-force my brother's password on a multibit wallet. It was encrypted using AES but it wouldn't make much difference if they'd used an alternative scheme. The fact remains that with any encryption scheme, you can still check maybe a million passwords every second with a fairly average computer. A simple bit of mathematical understanding should allow you to discover that everything I said was true - if you have a good idea what the password might have been then you'll be able to crack it with perseverance. Arguing the opposite just shows that you don't really understand cryptography. 
But best of luck to you.

Its still a question of trust. Would you trust, for example, a nascent crypto currency with a business registered in the cayman islands and no decentralisation? Or a crypto which can be attacked for the cost of 200 dollars per hour? Or the oldest, most resilient, battle tested and leaderless network with 100 times more hashing power than the top 500 supercomputers combined? This is why people speak of network effects, something which is certainly a feature of currency. Look at the dollar or euro. The more widely its used, the more widely its accepted. Its a positive feedback loop. 
That's my take on it anyway. If bitcoin isn't for you, fair enough. I don't want to convert people, this isn't a religion.

Ok so Putin did meet Buterin at the St Petersburg economic forum a year and a half ago, and afterwards he made a lot of positive noises about ''blockchain technology'' (yes frustrating I know). This rather odd character Ginko does seem to work as a professional economist at the russian presidential academy, and his twitter account certainly isn't denying what he said. With that said, announcing a massive buy before completing the order would be pretty fucking stupid, by anyone's measure. You mentioned the article stating that the russian government couldn't buy the coins from an exchange. I think what they meant here was they'll use OTC methods to purchase the coins. Interesting times anyway. We'll see what happens. My gut instinct is that its unlikely - but hope springs eternal.

Ok So I'm also a british lbc user like you with an old account. Provided you can prove that the payment was reversed, the decision will go in your favour I'm certain. Can you tell me the name of the account you were trading with? 
The difficulty I suspect is the fact that the coins will have already been released. 
Edit: Just reading through the original post that you submitted back in November. I agree with some of the points UKcoin was making, which is that you also need to consider making a complaint to your bank. At the end of the day, you sold something online and received payment for it. It's not practically in your power to ensure that the account you are receiving money from isn't stolen. I think you can take it to the ombudsman - write a letter making it clear exactly what happened and explaining to the bank that you will be forced to take this matter to the ombudsman if they insist upon ignoring your problem. Basically, the more I think about this, the more I come to the conclusion that LBC is not the party at fault here. Its a problem with fraudulent bank transfers, which isn't within the remit of lbc.

No since when one of the transactions 'confirms', the coins are removed from something called the 'utxo set' (the set of all unspent outputs from previous transactions). Nodes keep an eye on this and a transaction is only valid if it is spending from the unspent set.

Since there is no contract that I remember signing, I'm guessing that you're talking about Rousseau's 'social contract'. This to me is just a fact of life - with or without the state - you will be compelled to do things that you do not want to do. I'm pretty sure that in nations like Somalia - where the state is pretty much non-existent in most areas - there is still a great deal of 'unfairness' and 'violent coercion'.

As a child, whether you are educated privately or by the state, its probably going to be 'against your will' since children have very few rights in our society. We could have a separate discussion about the rights of children, but that's another topic entirely. 
You'll probably find that my beliefs regarding the autonomy and supremacy of the individual are very close to yours. I don't like taxes being wasted on wars and I'd prefer smaller government to a large, autocratic and over-reaching government. I want far more local control over how taxes are spent. However, public education, health, court systems, roads etc etc have developed as a voluntary response to societies problems.

Firstly I totally understand your frustration, but we both know that it isn't the bitcoin transaction that is causing the delay. Its good news if they haven't released the coins, you're far more likely to have this resolved in your favour. What counts against you is the fact that you were using a new account. I use lbc and I've been using them, like you, since 2013. I think this counted in my favour considerably when I had to dispute a trade, and it was resolved within a day. That makes a big difference, since its far more likely that you're the trustworthy party. However, not to worry, if you have all this proof then I'm sure it will resolve in your favour. Give it time and you'll be fine.

There are many very well educated people here: obviously you'll find most studied computer science/maths or something similar at uni, although i suspect most will tell you that university education is not a necessary requirement to comprehend tricky ideas ranging from coding to cryptography to game theory. 
Bear in mind that originally bitcoin was created to challenge certain econonmic orthodoxies. So right from start it was unlikely to attract people from that background. After it showed no signs of weakness, economic commentators felt that they had to explain how they had been blind sided by such an original approach to value.

Im not so sure the central banks have the stomach for tightening. That could lead to currency crises which in turn could lead many people into the arms of crypto.

It's a question of trust. 
Currently central banks already have digital currency - You use it every time you do any banking online. You use it because you trust it - for now. Unless you live in Venezuela, or Zimbabwe. The bitcoin protocol solves the trust problem without recourse to a central authority, and so its for quite specific purposes - if you don't trust the issuer of your currency to control interest rates or inflation, then bitcoin is for you.

I have two kids -
edit to clarify my position: I'm very much behind the entrepreneur who developed the app. If its a good app and it works, brilliant - she'll make a small passive income stream out of it which is awesome. I give not one solitary shit about her being 'economical with the truth' about who coded what in her app - if she grabbed some open source code or paid someone to program it then great. 
But she posted it on a public forum. And everyone will have their supporters and detractors. That's just the way it is. If someone posted online rape threats that's a completely different matter and should be reported to reddit or whoever - Its really not difficult to deal with - and given the geography of the situation, its unlikely to become a genuine threat. In life you meet arseholes. You can't legislate against it. Curtailing freedom of speech to stop bullying is a terrible idea.

If the market is really efficient, the price differences will be remarkably close to the cost in fees to conduct the arb trade. If you have people you trust in other countries, it could be worthwhile though, since the price differences from region to region can sometimes be very large indeed. 
If you're looking to arb trade though you might want to take a look at localbitcoins. Buy off one of the big exchanges and sell on there at above market rate. It will give you a better idea regarding the difficulties of successfully exploiting arbitrage opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:09:21
The best way of looking at bitcoin is that its pseudonymous, not anonymous. Why? Well your public address is on the blockchain and that is your pseudonym on the blockchain. Provided you can make sure that address is impossible to connect to your real identity (not very easy but not that difficult - hint: btc-&gt;xmr-&gt;btc) then you're anonymous.

@_date: 2017-09-17 14:48:59
I'm pretty sure this is because the Japanese (and Korean) exchanges have a zero fee trading model, and this massively drives up volume. 
For example, prior to the pboc banning zero fee trading in January, the Chinese exchanges accounted for 90% of btc trading worldwide. After the ban it was 15%. 
The moral of the story is zero fee exchanges are basically just volume bots trading back and forth. 
But it is undeniable that btc is taking off in Japan, Korea and India.

It depends on the methodology. Very hard to compare transaction volumes of exchanges, *particularly when comparing zero fee exchanges*. I believe bitcoin average excludes exchanges with zero fee. You can understand why. You could just trade one bitcoin back n forth over a very tight spread and your trading volume will inflate.

Relax. Firstly the bitcoin gold fork is coming with replay protection so you're all good there. Regarding the second fork (x2) you're right to be worried but probably not for the reasons you think. If you just hold and avoid any transactions then you will be unaffected. A replay attack is where your transactions are replayed on both forks. Essentially it means nodes can't distinguish between the two forks. A serious problem but not if you're just sitting around, waiting for it all to blow over. 
Hope that makes sense.

Oh I agree that the market can be moved by a Charlie Lee tweet and that politics plays a big part in the endless arguments between devs, exchanges users and miners. This is probably not a popular view but I see that as a healthy system of checks and balances. By 'free from political interference' I mean its properties of censorship resistance. No government has managed to edit the record of transactions so far, or deny people access to the network. 
Regarding smart contracts, well multisig is a smart contract but there does remain a lot to prove. 
And yeah sure, no one knows for sure what will happen. You get this though in every trading thread.

Well perhaps you're right, all I know (anecdotally) is that most of the people I can think of who hold bitcoin as a serious investment, or use it on a regular basis - well they are not 'casual' users who couldn't care less about what's happening behind the scenes. Who knows what will happen in November?

its been pretty useful if you want to buy/sell something you're not allowed to. Its overvalued though at the moment. Its coming back down to earth.

Agreed. For large companies wishing to avoid paying corporation tax bitcoin is worse than useless.

Ok so we have two competing predictions here. You say cash will be the best investment between now and March. I'm claiming bitcoin will be. All we have to do is check the btc price in March. Its currently $8170 on bitfinex. Lets speak again on March 1st.

Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:37:06
The stomach churning drops happen almost yearly and are only to be expected when the price generates the kind of hype that attracts dumb money to dumb projects (see tron market valuation). This will calm the price and i expect we'll go mostly sideways whilst we lay the groundwork for the next big run up. At some point even the naysayers will start to understand that money and cryptography have and always will be inseparable and bitcoin is merely the continuation of this trend. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:33:03
1) electrum helped me out massively for the last fork. I'm sure they're looking out for me again. 
2) full nodes are great for the network, but its risky to keep coins on a full node, since they're always online. You don't even need a wallet to 'control the private key'. You just need the random 256 bit number, which normally comes disguised as 11-13 memorable words. 
3) Cold storage for most of your savings. Buy the dips. Keep a small amount in a wallet on an online computer to buy stuff when the price goes up. There's tons of stuff you can buy now. Support the ecosystem. 
4) Stop checking the price. Enjoy life. Go ride a bike. Have a beer. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:13:45
Yeah yeah yeah. I suggest you take a long look at what constitutes a 'transaction' on the eth network.

@_date: 2017-09-30 10:01:48
Its easy to split with electrum. Note private key from current electrum address. Generate a new electrum address and send btc to new address. Download electron cash (electrum for bch). Make sure you are using correct server (this might happen automatically now). Import private key noted from earlier. Hey presto. Its done.

uninstall and reinstall. Delete the wallet file as well. So you generate another wallet.

You have to understand what they are banning. Essentially it would be a ban on citizens ascribing value to particular random numbers between 1 and 2^256, since that is all a private key is. Surely this is protected under freedom of speech and belief?

If you're claim that bitcoin offers very little for users in the developed world were true, bitcoin shouldn't have a market cap of 100 billion dollars. Likewise your claim that no one will spend a deflationary currency. These are claims which bitcoin has put to the test and the results are clear:
people will save, and spend a deflationary currency.

 The myth of the 'safe investment'. I expect people in the 30's considered gold a safe investment before Roosevelt confiscated it. Just as my sister considered her house purchase a safe investment until negative equity hit hard in the 90's just as she was forced to sell.

There is no catch. Some mining fools decided that they would fork the system, and now some other idiots are actually buying this coin! I sold mine at 0.12bch per btc and bought myself a sleek new bike. If you need a hand dumping them, just let me know. Its pretty simple though. Set up an account on polo. Send bch to polo.

I'm sure it will be ok. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:44:38
Why shouldn't a database be compared to a blockchain? They both serve the same purpose (retaining information), but do so in very different ways. 
And i would also dispute your second point that altcoins have surpassed bitcoin 'in every possible way'. What about metrics such as userbase, brand recognition, developer support, capital investment, hashrate security, choice of wallets, traction in the developing world, ease of use......
Granted much of the above is down to network effects. But network effects is a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:48:10
Ok so currently, I could try to double spend my coins. Broadcast two transactions - almost simultaneously. One gets picked up by node A and one by node B. I was under the impression that the blockchain would come to agreement since only one of those transactions could be included in the next block. 
How would this be different? Genuine question looking for someone with the patience to answer.

Its entirely down to 'zero fee trading'. The exchanges in China used to allow trading with zero costs. So you would have 'volume bots' operating on the exchanges just ping ponging trades between themselves at no cost and sometimes making a profit. When its zero fee it actually encourages traders to buy their own sells and leads to grossly inflated volumes. I think the pboc stopped this practice and January and ever since then the Chinese exchanges have much smaller volume (about 12%?). However, Japan and South Korea have zero fee trading now, and so now they have the ridiculously large volumes. 
TLDR. Zero fee trading distorts the true volume being traded. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:54:45

Bitcoin is not just a payment network. Its not just a tool to store wealth. Its both these things and so much more. I've bought pizza, two vaporisers, vpn, hosting and some other 'goods' which definitely can't be bought with visa. Essentially its value lies in the fact that it really can't be shut down. So its a medium of exchange that is free from political interference. That amongst other important properties (possibility of smart contracts etc etc) gives bitcoin its current valuation. 
If you think its overvalued, short it. The nice thing about bitcoin is the market never closes and anyone can participate. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:55:52
Regulation is happening - And it doesn't seem to be affecting demand. We've just had the largest country on the planet stop all trading and yet still people are bidding the price up. The genie is out of the bottle and the world is changing - with or without your support.
 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:00:55
Ok having made an almost catastrophic error four years ago, I can offer the following facts:
The 12 word seed is everything. It IS the private key to your bitcoins. All you ever need is this and a computer, to get access to your bitcoins. 
The password you encrypt the wallet file with is pretty useless without the computer you installed the wallet on. It protects the private key (think 12 word seed) on that computer by encrypting it. Keep this safe, but not as safe s the 12 words. 
Basically you don't need any wallet back ups on that machine. Delete the wallet if you like. But just because you deleted it, doesn't mean its really [deleted](
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:36:25

I used to gamble quite heavily (and chase my losses leading to bouts of depression). Then four years ago I got into bitcoin and it completely changed my approach. I still get the thrill of winning having my money in bitcoin, but if its going down I just stubbornly hold - as if I was chasing a horrendous loss. I've made ten times more than I ever did in a night in the casino. The fact that it ties in nicely with my political beliefs is an added bonus. 
Careful with those altcoin exchange casinos though......They'll take your bitcoins one way or another

Haha. Pothead Howard Marks. "No reason why ganga can't serve as a currency"
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:44:59
I suffered exactly the same despair when I tried to sort out my brothers wallet. It was when I first got into bitcoin in 2013 and I mistakenly thought that the password didn't matter as we had the .key file. Basically if you're problem is like mine, that file is actually encrypted using AES. The script on the Multibit website generates loads of false positives but the btcrecover program doesn't. It felt very sketchy using someone elses code (I'm not a coder so how do I know it hasn't installed a key logger?) but I spoke with the guy on bitcoin talk and he was really genuine. It was only for 0.1btc, which at the time I cracked it (2015?) was about 60 quid. If you need a hand with crafting the right script (use the wildcards etc etc) let me know. You can do it buddy!

I'm not sure how feasible that is to do though for you. Just my two cents. Others may disagree.

Its better to transfer all in one go, as transaction fees aren't done as a percentage of the value of the transaction, but rather as a standing charge (which fluctuates according to network demand). And yep, you'll have coins on both forks. If the network forks. Just make sure you've got your coins safely tucked away on a secure desktop - or even better cold storage - wallet.

Well basically I fell victim to the following scam. I used this link which must have been in the post to generate a counterparty wallet. 
I've had counterparty wallets before but hardly ever touch it now. It offered to sweep the private keys, but needed a tiny bit of bitcoin to approve the transaction. So I sent 0.002 to an address to help sweep the keys. 
Seems so obvious now. Hehehehe. I badly needed to learn that lesson. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:30:00
I must admit I'm really perplexed. I can't seem to find any unconfirmed transactions going to the first address which is odd if it really is an unconfirmed transaction problem. The big transaction you want to find is obviously the one for 0.157. Could you 'long click' and view that transaction on the block explorer and tell me what it says?
edit: once again though, i don't want you to worry. Its probably just a case of waiting and eventually it'll magically appear back in your wallet. Can take a day or two though.

Ive never used coinbase. Probably their fee but it covers the transaction fees. You should be able to send for less than a dollar on quiet moments, so i would say thats a bit steep.

The old 'altcoins have better tech so will take over' argument suffers from a number of short comings.
Firstly its not entirely clear that they do have better tech. The developers in bitcoin are top of their game programmers and cryptographers - no other coin can match the depth, breadth and sheer number of contributors to the core code. Development is conservative rather than experimental and that ensures bitcoin avoids billion dollar mishaps. And when it comes to genuine efficiency impovements (like segwit) they tend to be developed by bitcoin devs. 
But even if we accept that some coins improve on bitcoin in terms of speed, or fungibility, it doesnt follow that bitcoin will instantly be replaced. For money, its all about how widely accepted something is. So despite bitcoin being far better than the US dollar, it will still take two decades to displace it in my opinion.

You mention that the chaps at pheeva have given you an 'encrypted string' which I'm sure is just your encrypted private key. You now need to find out two things:
(a) Which encryption scheme they used (my guess would be AES). 
(b) What form the private key was in (compressed/uncompressed - hex or base 64).
If you can find out both these things then myself or someone else can help you some more. Definitely DO NOT give up on this. Its 100% possible to crack this if you have a good idea what the password is.

All I'd say is don't leave your coins on coinbase. People are still waiting for their bch from the last fork. Its unlikely they'll do you any favours. 
In which case you'll need a wallet at home on your desktop. I'd suggest electrum. And I'd suggest cold storage for any significant amounts, or at the very least turning on 2FA authentication. Let me know if you need a hand setting this up.

Oh you're absolutely right. If someone steals your private keys, there's no Freephone number to cancel your transactions. That's why it resembles cash in a wallet more than a debit card.

They're trading on the future price of x2. So you put up your btc against someone else (i hope) putting up their own btc as collateral. If they take the contract, they should have plenty to cover the bet with in november since 1btc=1btcx2 on the day of the fork.

Nothing wrong with constructive and critical debate - in fact its absolutely crucial. 
There are many alternatives to crypto. Gold and Silver are the most obvious choices, but investing in energy is probably a safe(ish) place to insulate your savings from economic disasters. Diversification is key.
But far more important than any investment strategy is ensuring that you have a range of useful and rare skills that will always be coveted in the job market. If you want to protect yourself from the chaotic nature of the modern world, you need to make sure you have the kind of practical skills that are in high demand. High unemployment rates amongst the young are endemic in many parts of the western world at the moment (spain, greece, italy etc etc) and holding a little bitcoin is unlikely to solve any of your problems there. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:54:05
Random unsourced news that some stores in Sweden will accept bitcoin at some unspecified time. Probably the most bullish news in the last five years. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:32:39
Sensible people will never say 'banks are evil'. They serve a purpose in society - offering credit for starters. Protecting deposits is another one. What is risible however is the cosy relationship banks now have with the regulators. It's got so bad that when they facilitate and profit from reckless lending, they are bailed out by the taxpayers. This is what most sensible people in society (crypto enthusiasts and non-crypto enthusiasts) stand against. And this is to say nothing of the fractional reserve system, or the billions of unbanked, or or or.......
What bitcoin offers people is an exit from the system; banks are welcome to join, since bitcoin is by its very nature neutral and indifferent to the players. If it was any other way it really couldn't be regarded as 'money' in the true sense. Money is neutral. And bitcoin is neutral. It has no 'special relationship' with governments, miners, developers or hodlers. Anyone can play. 
Least that's my take on it.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:52:14
Don't say goodbye to them. Sounds like multibit is stuck syncing the blockchain. Can you export the private keys from that wallet?
You need the multibit.key file. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:56:46
Use a wallet with a wallet seed (electrum for example), keep it offline and pick a price point where you'll be happy to sell (some of) your bitcoins. Don't sell anything before that. 
My personal target is 30,000 pounds (about 45k-50k in $) per coin. 
Buy your bitcoins from wherever is cheapest and easiest for you. It doesn't really matter.

I understand the reasoning behind your claim but the fact is that both major forks prior to this (eth/etc and btc/bch) resulted in the sum of the two forks being worth *more* than the original. Now obviously past results wont necessarily repeat but its something to think about when gaming the upcoming fork.

Yes.

Yes, provided you had bitcoin before August 1st (I think that was the date of the fork but I'm too lazy to google and check) then you will have BCH. But where do you hold your coins? For example, if you had them on coinbase then I don't think you'll have access till January. If you held it in a personal wallet (desktop) then I'm sure you can access it now. If you need a hand I or someone else will be able to guide you through the process. First question though. Which wallet was your bitcoin in? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:10:38
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:38:03
Thats a ridiculous assertion. Pretty much everyone was advising that every time it goes up this fast it subsequently crashes down to a value above the previous ATH. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:43:00
The coins will eventually magically appear back in your wallet, so don't worry too much. Look up your wallet address on the block explorer to put your mind at ease. By the way, if your wallet has the replace by fee option, you can pay a little extra to speed up the transaction. Or you can use one of the transaction accelerators. If its not an emergency though I'd just wait. #
The problem is the mempool spamming currently. Trying to convince us x2 is necessary. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:17:24
I'm not an expert but I think there is a 'master public key' from which the rest of your public addresses are derived. If you have this, I'm certain you could check your addresses on a block explorer without plugging it in. 
edit: If you're unfamiliar with block explorers, take a look at this [one]( - paste your public address in and be amazed as you see your balance online. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:32:46

@_date: 2017-09-28 18:41:01
Ok firstly thanks very much for the detailed reply, i've got a much better picture now how this differs from the bch fork. Essentially the nodes will not distinguish between the two chains so using appropriate client software and spending to fresh addresses won't wash. What about using the nlocktime feature? Im not an expert but i seem to remember some people using that approach to split their coins before. I presume there must be some way of achieving this anyway......
Also, i recollect that exchanges were only happy to offer bch after replay protection was promised. Has anyone heard anything from the big exchanges like stamp, finex and bithumb? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:03:58
I agree - but no one knows for sure - I've still bought tons of stuff with bitcoin along the way. I buy btc when the price is (in my opinion) low and I buy stuff with bitcoin when the price is (in my opinion) high. So far its worked out pretty well.

@_date: 2017-10-12 16:13:02
I don't think this is entirely true. I've been buying and selling bitcoin in the UK for four years now via bank transfer with localbitcoins using a barclays account. 3 years ago, just before I sold some to put a deposit down on my house, I even told barclays that I was selling bitcoins to raise the deposit. They didn't care one bit. 
Basically use localbitcoins with a trader with decent rep. Don't mention bitcoins in the reference and you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:35:42
You are correct. If you send the coins from an exchange which has your personal info, then it would be pretty easy for law enforcement to track that to you. Send it from that exchange to your personal wallet, and its still looks like its **probably** your wallet. The more links in the chain, the less likely that you control the private keys for that wallet. 
If you truly want to obscure your path, use an altcoin exchange with no personal info on you and go btc -&gt; xmr -&gt;zec-&gt;btc and withdraw to a fresh wallet. 
Probably not necessary though unless youre buying yellowcake.

Promiscuous is probably the last word you're typing in and as the cryptography uses a 'check digit' your seed is then being rejected.

Multibit (I suspect) is lying to you. But lets see. Find your public addresses in the transactions bit. Under description it will say where you were 'receiving' the unconfirmed transactions (or you may be interested in the addresses you were sending to - give me a bit more info about the unconfirmed transaction) and then use this website:
paste the public addresses in and see what it says. 
Hope that makes sense. Just ask again if you need a hand. Its no problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:20:43
The best thing to do would be to import your private keys from the multibit wallet into a new wallet. Its definitely nothing to do with transaction fees as transaction id shows over 45000 confs. Have you tried importing your multibit keys into a new wallet yet? 
edit: just looked into importing multibit into electrum. Sounds like it can be a bit awkward on account of the compressed keys multibit uses. Download electrum first and then lets work through this.

create standard wallet

@_date: 2017-10-29 16:08:38
As everyone else is telling you. The full node wallets (like core) only list the real balance when fully synced. To get round syncing the whole wallet (which will take days) you could import the private key into electrum or some other lite client. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:25:12

If its received a confirmation then its too late really to reverse and it should receive subsequent confirmations as blocks get found every ten minutes. Post the transaction id if you need a hand and we can look it up on the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-10-07 15:23:40
I used the same approach. Ok assuming that you had your coins in an electrum wallet prior to the fork. First send these coins to a new electrum address. Then use the private key from your old electrum wallet in the electron cash wallet. Make sure the server is using one for the bch chain (you might not need to do that anymore). Hopefully you now have your coins sitting pretty in two wallets on two separate blockchains.

Relax. It'll be similar to the fork in August. Might be tougher to split the coins though this time. 
Bottom line is, should the forks proceed, you'll have bitcoin gold and bitcoin x2 on a 1 to 1 basis with your current bitcoin holdings.

Excuse my ignorance, I know that there is no replay protection promised with x2. But will the status of my coins not be dependent upon the wallet software? If for example you use electrum, can you not just make sure you're connected to a node that is operating on the chain you'd like to use?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:22:08
Don't worry, if the transactions haven't confirmed then you just need to wait like a day or two and then the coins magically appear back in your wallet. Really annoying I know, normally down to the wallet software using a poor fee estimation algorithm. Best to set the fee manually sometimes. 
The message your getting is telling you that it can't create a child pays for parent transaction. Could be because you haven't got any coins (no dust even) left in your wallet. 
edit: could you post the tx id's from your wallet. I just want to check on a different block explorer.

That's going to be the tricky bit - particularly with the mid November fork. Electrum was a very easy wallet to use for splitting your coins in the last fork. 
Give it a little more time and there will be a guide coming out on how to split your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:19:31
Naming and shaming is not 'important information'. Important information would be 'here is how you can split your coins with nlocktime' and 'here is a list of exchanges where you can dump segwitx2'. 
If readish could possibly start spamming this subreddit with that information, well that would be great. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:27:01
You'll be pleased to learn that the community is doing just that (improving transaction times and ease of use) through the lightning network. However, if you prefer proof of stake and believe its the future, there are plenty of altcoins that utilise this protocol which you can invest in. About 4 years ago when I first became interested in this space I was an avid peercoin fan (the very first proof of stake coin). I gradually learnt that proof of stake is not as secure as proof of work (or gradually morphs into PoW in an attempt to stay secure) and so in my opinion, its not really an option. 
With regard to transaction fees being able to pay for the network - its 120 years into the future so I don't really feel comfortable making a prediction.

The PBOC is being deliberately obscure, but there can be little doubt that they're putting pressure on the exchanges.

Great question IMHO.

You haven't got just one address - in either your bread wallet or your Ledger - I think they're called HD wallets but essentially you have a number of addresses all derived from a parent. Basically whenever you spend bitcoin then all bitcoins will be spent from that address and then the change will be returned to a change address you control. Look up HD wallets [here]( for more info. 
You shouldn't have lost 0.1btc that's for sure though.

I totally see where you're coming from: a lot of people find it easier to keep their btc in a web wallet. The added responsibility that you have if you keep them yourself simply insulates you from exchange collapses. The trouble is, there were so many of these in the early days - due to a fifty fifty mixture of incompetence and fraud - that the natural reaction was the mantra 'not your keys not your coins'. In my opinion it definitely does depend on your circumstances and if I was in your shoes, I wouldn't feel paranoid having them there. But I would start to go through the process of setting up a desktop wallet. After you do that, you'll probably go one stage further and make a few paper wallets. Its not too tricky to do and its fun to learn how to do it anyway. You don't have to spend any money to be practically just as secure as a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:11:03
Ok so now I don't understand how you can reverse a transaction but for a different amount? That doesn't make any sense. Surely someone paid you £200 and you can see on lbc trade history the name of the bank account which sent you two hundred pounds. If they sent a different amount, then you seem to be describing reversing a transaction but for an alternative amount than the amount originally sent. I'm super confused so I can understand why Barclays didn't side with you in this. It should be really straightforward to identify who sent this and who reversed it, and most importantly prove that you released the bitcoins to their account.

@_date: 2017-10-25 17:25:56
I think you might have missed the point. Both r/btc and r/bitcoin believe that they have the correct solution to your 1. and 2. r/btc believes bigger blocks will make transactions quicker and cheaper. r/bitcoin believes the lightning network is the best way to achieve this. 
Personally I think the disagreements are not necessarily a bad thing. As I've said before, any project which requires unity to succeed is doomed to fail.

Electrum is one of the best wallets out there; the devs are the very best and have been doing what they do for a long time. I use electrum and its great. 
I think you're referring to the guy who lost 95btc. I think his mistakes were the following:
(a) using windows
(b) not putting any 2FA on his wallet
(c) keeping his wallet online with 1/3 of a million dollars on it. 
To be fair, he probably should have used a hardware wallet (hindsight is a wonderful thing). 
Electrum is fine for the fork. Just do nothing and you'll have coins on both forks. Closer to the time there will be (I hope!) some support for splitting coins, if the fork actually happens. 
In the mean time, in terms of wallet security, I'd suggest you learn how to use cold storage. Do you have an old computer that you don't use any more? Or one which never goes online? If you do, we can walk you through the process of setting up cold storage so you never worry again about stealing your bitcoins.

Bitcoin is just one long list of transactions, all recorded in the 'blocks' which store these transactions every ten minutes. 
A fork is where all of a sudden, there is a difference of agreement which transactions happened and which didn't, from that point on. Hence from a particular block in mid November, it currently looks like there will be two competing versions of bitcoin each with their own separate transaction history after the block where they fork (note very importantly they will have exactly the same transaction history before this block). 
Since you already own bitcoin, you will have coins on both chains (on both sides of the fork) so you can relax. All you really have to worry about is finding a way to split your coins. There will be guides nearer the time to achieve this. 
Just make sure your coins are in a nice safe desktop (or cold storage) wallet.

A nonce is similar to a 'counter' in cryptography I think.

(1) you'll have coins which exist on both forks, yet to be split. 
(2) You can only split your coins after the fork. 
(3) You have your coins replicated on both forks in the full value. So for example, after the bch fork earlier this year you would have 1 btc and 1 bch if you had one bitcoin prior to the fork. 
(4)The safest thing is to do nothing and hold both coins till it blows over. The riskier but possibly more profitable strategy is to dump the coin that's going to zero (in your opinion). 
(5) This is where it gets complicated. See this write up by Jimmy [Song]( and look for guides on here nearer the time. Everyone will help you split your coins.

I'm not trying to give you a hard time, just trying to identify for myself how I can avoid getting fucked over. Can I ask an honest question. Did you avoid local bitcoins because you'd done a shady 'off the books' cancel trade and then do it over the phone? I've been talked into that once on local bitcoins and actually the other guy was genuine and it was a successful trade. But obviously not having escrow is a big risk. Was there some reason you didn't mention it to lbc? Seems like I'd be pissed and telling lbc exactly what happened to try n get cash back.

I'm in a similar situation. Do you pay a penalty for early repayment of your mortgage? (I'm from the UK and I expect our mortgages may work a little differently). 
I plan on paying off as much as possible each year without incurring a charge. That way I'll still hold plenty for value to accrue but I will also be smashing down the debt at the same time. I can't see bitcoin going to zero any time soon so I'm hoping this is the best course of action.

The choice for brits buying bitcoin isn't that great in my opinion. Coinfloor is the only real exchange that comes to mind but you'll incur fees as the banking embargo on exchanges means you have to send it to their polish account. Probably the best way to do it is post a trade on local bitcoins looking for buyers. If you're patient and you've built up a solid reputation you can actually sell above the market rate. 
Other alternatives include bittylicious and bitstamp. Personally though I'd go with local bitcoins if you're planning on doing this regularly. If you're planning on doing it only once and its only for a relatively small amount (&lt;£2000) then I could even buy them off you. I was planning on getting a bit more anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:19:39
Yes I seem to recall after the etf rejection news came out, many posters held the opinion that we we're going sub 800 dollars again. You can understand their reasoning but that turned out to be dead wrong - The illusion of control.....
And of course as a regular bitcoiner with no inside information, I am at a disadvantage if I trade against others, some of whom may well know plenty that I don't. 
This is a long term play for me. I haven't really got the time to trade (as my story illustrates!). I'll be sitting on this small number of coins until they pay off a sizeable chunk of my mortgage. In the meantime I'd quite like to learn more about the maths involved in bitcoin, since this is my background and my coding experience is very limited. Its a great system of incentives which promises a great deal - especially for the poorest! Anyway thanks for looking after this for us all. Its genuinely appreciated.

Yeah you're doing the right thing there as that 'view transaction on explorer' is throwing a 'not a proper transaction id' page back at you, and that seems to me likely to be a problem with the wallet. You could try asking on here too, but I'm sure support will help. I'm almost certain it will all be fine but I'd also be stressing if it was my bitcoins so totally understand.

yeah its all flooding back with the token.txt file. Use the token.txt file but with the wild cards as well. That's what worked perfect for me as my brother gave me three words, one of which he was sure would be in it. And then maybe some numbers or letters on the start or end. This was perfect for the wildcards. I tried things like.....
%[l,L]itvinovo%0,6d    
which checks all variations of litvinovo, upper or lowercase at the start and anything from the digits 000000-999999 at the end. 
I seem to remember that was millions of combinations. 
Those wildcards are really useful.

So there is no way of knowing the exact amount of hashing power of the network at any given time. Miners don't reveal how much hash power they are using. So how do they construct hash rate graphs like this one [here]( Well one approach is to look at how many blocks are being found in a given time interval. If hash rate hasn't changed since the last difficulty adjustment (which happens every 2016 blocks, or roughly two weeks) then blocks should be found every ten minutes on average. However, if blocks are being found on average every 9 minutes (like you've suggested), then we can guess (and it is a guess) that hash rate has gone up since the last adjustment. However, if the average is greater than ten minutes then perhaps the hash power has gone down. 
The problem with this approach is its not full proof or even that accurate. You can see that from any given time period that blocks are found *randomly*, so if you're a bit unlucky, it might even take an hour to find a block. Two or three periods long periods of time between blocks makes it look as if the hash power has massively decreased, and likewise vice versa. This is why the hash power graph oscillates wildly. The miners aren't switching their machines on and off and on again. I think its more likely that the hash power was quite accidentally overestimated a bit, then underestimated by quite some margin. Its just variance.

That also ignores all those lost bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:49:22
So lets say you buy 100 UET (useless ethereum tokens) at 0.004btc each. You want to just hold them till they rise in price but you're actually rather worried since the price will most likely dump down at some point and you'd rather not lose 90%. 
So you want to make sure you sell if the price drops to 0.0035btc automatically to minimise losses. 
So you put a stop-limit sell at 0.0035btc:
the stop you put at 0.0035 triggering the sell at that price. The limit you put at 0.0033btc meaning you'll sell all the way down to 0.0033 but if it goes lower than that, well you aren't selling any more that cheaply. 
Buy is the same but in the reverse situation. So you'll start to buy if the price starts rocketing up. This is probably not used quite as often.

Funny, but I was just pondering a related idea.

It was my understanding that if something is described as legal tender in the UK then that meant that merchants **have to** accept it for goods or services. However, a merchant can **choose** to accept payment in whichever medium they like, provided it isn't illegal in itself. 
Could the government make owning bitcoin illegal? I can't really see how they could do this, since in essence they would be banning the recording of the integers from 1 to 2^256.
But banning exchanges. Well that's another kettle of fish. In the UK we already suffer from a banking embargo on the exchanges. There are no exchanges with UK bank accounts.

@_date: 2015-04-28 17:44:04
Jonstern has a good approach. This is very similar. Depends just how paranoid you are. Install electrum on pi (or any comp) and create wallet. Write down seed. Never lose this. Now install electrum on desktop with a watch only wallet and if you want to send money, sogn the transactions offline and broadcast them with your desktop.
Thing is, this is mostly pointless. Best thing to do is if you have serious amounts of bitcoin (savings) then keep them offline as described above. All you need is the thirteen words and theyre yours. Then keep spending money on your phone and you would have to be damn unlucky to be hacked. 
If you dont mind using linux on your desktop, you'll *probably* be fine not even bothering with cold storage. It depends on your paranoia levels.....

How are you measuring user adoption? I would argue that the best approach is to simply look at the number of transactions per day. This gives an idea of how many people/institutions are using the network regularly. And that has been steadily increasing at a constant rate since the genesis block. 
And you're right to highlight problems with the protocol - but I would argue that severe problems have already been fixed many times before. And the problems that face us in the future will be overcome. 
I'm quite optimistic. But I also stash my cash in other areas too.......
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:08:47
Its not as clear cut in terms of time as one might hope. Three days (so long as the wallet isn't resubmitting the transaction, which it shouldn't) is the best guide. See [this]( thread for more info.

I take your first point. Massive ICO collapse would be most probably negative for the bitcoin price as it could potentially put millions of people off of the idea of investing in crypto-currency through a 'guilt by association mentality. 
Some successful and intelligent people have been against every genuine innovation society has ever come up with. The internet is a good example and people were lining up to laugh at the idea of email. But to make blanket statements like 'the community just ignores all criticism' isn't actually true. If you listen to any of the best bitcoin speakers, they all address the weaknesses of the system. Nothing is perfect. 
And with regard to your last point, if I had to point to an academic subject with the highest rate of predictive failure, I'd have my finger pointing squarely at [economists](

Re-using an address really isn't a big deal if you're like 95% of crypto users - (a) You aren't using bitcoin in some kind of big criminal endeavour and (b) you don't hold a huge amount of bitcoins. If you meet these two criteria I really wouldn't be super worried about address re-use. As the great muffin says, its predominantly a privacy issue (easier to track your balances and possibly even find out who you are - although to completely blow up your pseudonymity they'd need to have access to the exchange you bought it from most likely). But also, in the long run re-using addresses actually makes it easier for it to be cracked by a (entirely theoretical) quantum computer.

Sigh. Yet another person who thinks bitcoin is supposed to fix human weaknesses like greed and corruption. It's only supposed to transfer value very quickly, without any need of middlemen or a central ledger. If you thought bitcoin was going to usher in an era of wealth equality, well i'm afraid you've been misinformed.

Can I say a bit more about this to calm you. Multibit if I recall correctly, uses/used an unusual format for its keys (public and private) so if you do try importing them it may not really work without using something like bitaddress to convert them. Which multibit version are you using? Im willing to bet five dollars on the lightning network we can find your coins.

I'm still not entirely convinced that macro events like cyprus and brexit that result in currency weakness are causally related to the bitcoin price increase. But its undeniable that there is a link.

Hi, I'm a barclays account holder who's been trading (on and off) on localbitcoins uk for a few years. I'd like to find out a bit more about the £200 charge back. Did you raise this with local bitcoins at the time, and did you dispute the chargeback with your bank? Presumably you had a reference number for the trade and could easily prove to barclays and localbitcoins that you released the coins? I mean, on a 2 or 3k deal the arbitrage is max, what, £200? I'm just trying to understand if you disputed the chargeback with the bank at the time. And if you didn't, why not?
@_date: 2018-07-31 07:39:31
BlockEncryptor is right. If you regularly use similar(ish) passwords and want to learn a little, trying to bruteforce this is well worth the effort. If you're likely to have used a 30 character randomly generated password then it won't be worth your effort, but if you have a very good idea what it is you can narrow down the search space and eventually you'll probably find it. It happened to me with 0.1btc and I had a lot of fun with this [tool]( just trying various combinations. I'm not super technical or anything like that, if I can do it you can too. 
And for three bitcoin. I shudder to imagine what I wouldn't do for three bitcoin.

Oh yes. I think the most sensible approach is to have most of it in cold storage if you've got lots. Also put it in separate wallets so if you lose one you don't lose it all. Then have like £50-100 in a hot wallet on your computer for general expenses.

Not screwed at all my friend. If you send a transaction with a fee so low the miners ignore it, the transaction never happens and eventually your electrum wallet balance will reflect this fact. 
edit: can take a few days (probably not that long though). If you have replace by fee enabled you could send the transaction again with a higher fee.

One of the most important events to slow segwit adoption was the 20 odd bitcoin forks which were considerably more difficult to claim from segwit addresses. Now we've successfully dumped most of them into oblivion, the time is ripe to move to segwit. The bech32 address format is still not supported by some exchanges though.

Things beside setting up a node:
I think the most important step would be to successfully split your coins using [locktime]( and then dump your x2 coins as quickly as possible. I know nodes are important, but the battle will truly be won on the exchanges, since miners will not want to continue mining at a loss. If you ask me, this was how bch was relegated to its current status: people took a position against bch and increased their btc holdings as a well deserved perk.

There are lots of ways to do it - it all depends how paranoid you are. Your approach will work but it raises the issue of deleted files. Once they are deleted, are they really [deleted]( I prefer to use a fresh Linux install on a raspberry pi. Set up the wallet then take it completely offline. But on my pc I create a ''watch only'' wallet so I can see my coins are there but even if my pc is hacked, no one is getting my coins. Another thing i'd be slightly worried about with exodus is all your coins are in one place. If someone hacks it you lose everything. Do you use 2FA? Definitely turn that on if you can. 
I also have like 80 dollars in btc online cause I like to buy stuff like vpn. If someone steals that, it will suck but its not a huge amount. The double benefit of this is it acts as a 'canary' wallet. If someone is on my network, they'll steal that and I'll know that my other coins are in danger and need to be secured quickly.

The ledger nano seems to be struggling to estimate the fees properly at the moment, since that is really quite a cheap fee. I don't think the ledger nano offers replace by fee - (I'm not sure as I don't own one). You'll probably have to wait till your transaction drops out of the mem pool. It shouldn't take longer than three days, but relax though, your coins are safe. 
As a side note, there's been a bazillion people in the last couple of days who seem to have suffered similar fates at the hands of the nano. I know hardware wallets are handy, but sometimes its nice to do the fee manually. 150-200 sats per byte is reasonable and should confirm in an hour.

If you intend to use coinbase as a personal wallet, most here will start chanting 'not your keys not your coins' - and i'm inclined to agree. 
My own setup involves an old offline raspberry pi (any old laptop/desktop will do) for cold storage with a 'watch only' wallet from electrum on my pc so i can send funds. But I also have pettycash (50 quid) bitcoin on that machine as well since its a bit of a faff signing transactions offline. But it really comes down to whatever suits you. If you don't mind someone else looking after your bitcoins, then at the very least turn on 2FA to keep them safe.

No. The graph of hash rate is an estimate, and swings wildly everyday thanks to the methodology used to estimate hash rate. They simply take the time between blocks (which should be ten mins but will be shorter as more hash comes online within the two week period before a difficulty retarget) and use that to estimate hash. Now here's the rub. The time between blocks is a poisson (ie random) process, with a variance as large as the mean (ten mins). The upshot of this is that the hash rate is almost certainly very steady, but when we try and estimate it we get a graph that makes it look like miners are switching their equipment on and off every hour.

OK so ICO's have nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with another crypto-currency called ethereum, so I'm not really sure what you're getting at here. If it is ''the altcoin market is massively overvalued'' then I 100% agree with you. 
Debating opposing opinions is good in any healthy forum, and I agree that they shouldn't simply be dismissed. I'm presuming that the opposing idea you're presenting is that 'we are in a bubble'. That's cool and given a certain time frame (6 months, 1 year I don't know) you may be right. Its fair to look back on November 2013 now and say 'we were in a bubble'. But now we are 6x higher. Inflation of fiat is a real problem when comparing past valuations with the present. Just look at the price your parents paid for a new house and compare it to your own mortgage. 
With your third and final point, replacing banks is very much a long term goal and I don't think anyone is under the illusion that this will occur quickly and without a fight. It probably won't ever happen. I totally respect that point of view (even if I don't share it). How do you see this playing out?

@_date: 2019-09-25 22:16:01
The hash rate didn't mysteriously drop. An estimate of the hash rate quite predictably dropped and then shot back up again after a few slow blocks. One simple look at the chart will show you (estimated) hash rate jumps up and down all the time if you look at the daily view for estimated hashrate \[here\]([ Because they estimate it by looking at average block time, which is in itself random with high variance. If you want a smoother picture of what's really going on, click the 7 day moving average at least which will smooth out the completely predictable anomalies. Who knows, the rate dipped a bit but we don't have any hard evidence to suggest that 40% of miners shut down for that day.

Its not like bittrex really. That's an exchange with an order book. Local bitcoins is different. You still set a price you're willing to buy/sell at - if you want to advertise (small fee) or you can respond to someone elses advert and just pay the higher/lower price on the spread. Basically its just a listing website for bitcoin trades. Just make sure you use traders with solid reputation and don't mention bitcoins in the reference. I've never had any trouble on there though and I've done more than 100 trades now.

'Bitcoin is a joke' 
'Do you swap dollars for bitcoins so you can get Euros or Canadian Dollars? No.'
'Is it a store of value? Absolutely no'
Those statements are quite obviously untrue but this last one......
"Is it a unit of account? Nothing is accounted for in bitcoins."
has slightly more weight to it. You might need to go to a few private vpns or open up a tor brower to find sites where every single item is listed in bitcoins. The unit of account definition is a little narrow anyway. If I bring £ to the US where everything is accounted for in $, does that make my pounds no longer count as money? 
Also, is anyone here arguing that bitcoin is anything like our national currencies? No. No we're not. It's just schmuck insurance against the inevitable decline of state backed currencies. Give it some time though and we'll see if it ends up being a unit of account.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:40:58
Ok so basically it works like this - you need two computers, one online and one which you intend to keep offline. On the online computer you'll make a 'watch only wallet' which will show you your bitcoin balance from the offline wallet but as it doesn't have the private keys, no one can steal your shit. The private keys remain on the offline one so its all good. Incidentally, this is pretty much what exchanges do. So if its good enough for finex, its good enough for me. 
The trick is to get the electrum wallet software installed on the offline machine. For the uber paranoid purists, they will tell you to download the zip file on the online machine after checking the checksums and then transfer using a usb. Oh and make sure its a fresh install of tails or something. To be honest I find that all a bit paranoid, so I just use a fresh install of linux on my pi and quickly put it online *once* to download electrum. Then I take it offline. 
Once you've done that its fairly simple. Note the bitcoin address once you've taken it offline and send the coins to that address. Voila, cold storage. One more thing you need. Locate the master public keys under 'wallet' and copy this onto a mem stick. 
And to keep an eye on your coins, install electrum now onto the online computer and set up a 'watch only' wallet. This is where you input the master PUBLIC keys (not private so its all good).  
I've just realised I'm rubbish at explaining things. Try this [guide]( which includes how to send bitcoins from an offline wallet. Its a bit of a faff but once its done you'll sleep much easier. 
Best of luck with whatever you do fella. Take it easy!

If you're using electrum or a similar light client it really should show the correct balance almost immediately. If you're something like bitcoin core then it could take a lot longer. I seem to remember multibit from years past would take some time before the correct balance was displayed.

If you put a password on the wallet then you encrypted the private key and seed, regardless of whether the wallet was open or not. If you want to send bitcoins then even with the wallet open, you need to input your password again to sign the transaction.
Edit: If you have even a vague idea about what the password might have been, it might be worth trying to bruteforce it open using this tool. [

There are several different import formats.

Your claim that ''if you are in crypto for some time now, you'll know that there are far better projects and altcoins out there" is false. Bitcoin is boring compared to many of the features altcoins possess because by its very nature, it is conservative and difficult to change. This is a strength not a weakness. I can think of three altcoins off the top of my head which suffered from catastrophic [flaws]( - mainly due to their complexity (if you're wondering, monero, zcash, shadow cash). Note as well that many of these coins piggyback off ideas developed originally for bitcoin - confidential transactions being a good example. 
I'm not saying that altcoins will not succeed. Some may. Most won't. 
And good for you for being polite in your posting. We don't have to agree but we can at least be civil. Good manners cost nothing ey!

There are some great videos out there, but download a wallet and find out for yourself. Explanations will only take you so far. 
The only piece of advice I would stress is download a wallet where you control the private key (electrum works for me but there are hundreds of other wallets) and write down the seed, store it somewhere safe. Anyone who knows those words in order, can spend your money.

If you prefer windows thats fine. But there are loads more viruses written for windows in comparison with linux. Just because its more common. But loads of people use windows so don't worry if its what you are used to. 
The seed words are not your password or the 2FA. They are even more important than that because with the seed words anyone can access your bitcoins. Your seed words are your private key. So they are the most important thing you have to keep safe. If i knew your seed words i could spend your bitcoins without needing anything else - not even access to your pc. 
The password allows you to open the wallet on your computer and send funds. Essentially the password allows you to decrypt your private key. This means that if someone has your password **and** access to your computer they can spend your bitcoins. Contrast this with the seed words where they **dont** need access to your computer - just the seed. 
2FA is just a second password like the first. It is the big thing you need though, if you're not using cold storage - or if you have a lot of funds on an exchange (they all have 2FA option - you really must use it). Your bank account probably has 2FA (stands for two factor authentication. 2 ways to authenticate. Firstly a password. Secondly a code which changes according to the time). To turn on 2FA you need to download google authenticator from the app store first. Then you'll need to set up a new wallet and select the 2FA option and scan the qr code. 
You only really need this though with a hot wallet. 
Hope this all makes sense. Any more questions please feel free to ask.

Have a look at that graph, it goes up and down like a heartbeat. Do you think miners are switching their equipment on and off like disco lights?
No. 
The graph is estimated hash rate, since there is no way of knowing the hash rate at any time. How do they estimate it? Well they use the average time between blocks, which in itself is a random process. What does this mean? Well it means that variance alone can give wildly different estimated hash rates even when the rate is constant. If, just by chance, you have the time found between blocks to be growing larger then it will appear that the hash rate is going down when in fact it is static (and likewise in the reverse direction). The upshot of it is wildly erratic swings in estimated hash rate as seen on this graph.

Tax implications vary from person to person and you only pay capital gains taxes on your profits (the profits were not five figures!). Also, the smart thing to do would be set yourself up as a limited company or sole trader of bitcoins and then use well understood tax avoidance devices like expenses (computer, car, annual Christmas party) to offset that against your profits. You might still need to pay an accountant, but a good one is worth their weight in gold.

No not really. I'm not fussed about getting rich, its just a nice way to save money - if you're half way sensible you buy things with btc when the price is high and buy more bitcoin when the price is lower. Obviously that's impossible to know but it never hurts to buy nice things and support the principle - sound money - behind bitcoin. 
Let's be honest, you have zero evidence to back your claim that 'fiat is here to stay' just as I have no proof that 'bitcoin will win'. We live in a world of unknowns but we all have to make a move, even if that is to stick with what you know.

No Hal Finney thread is complete without this humbling quote from the man himself about his contentment with life despite his diagnosis with a terminal illness: 
"It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support "Trusted Computing", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.
And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.
That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy."

I know what you're saying, but there's a difference between occasionally expressing your beliefs without letting them define you, and boring people to death with an obsession. I think it's correct to say grammatik has one great tune about BTC, and that's it. Fair enough if you ask me

My paper wallets just use the seed words personally. But I'm surprised that the bitcoin wiki is frowning on paper wallets with private keys (Qr code or raw hex or whatever). Printer attack? Ok but pretty unlikely! The point about running a full node applies to almost all other wallets that don't run the client. I'm puzzled as to why its considered so unsafe.

Go back to posts from this sub from 4 years ago. You'll find identical posts to yours except they wrote 10,000 instead of 1,000,000. I can understand people not being interested in bitcoin, but i'll never understand why some people who dislike bitcoin choose to waste their time posting in this sub day after day. Find something you are interested in and engage with it. Life is so much better if you figure out what you stand for, not just what you stand against.

Appreciate your thoughts. A restart seems to have done the trick so far but I'm going to keep a close eye on it because I've often suspected that my broadband fibre connection is actually far less impressive than the claimed speeds. 
But setting up an alert on bitnodes sounds like the way to go to me. I don't really come from a coding background but something reasonably simple (I hope!) like this sounds like a good project and a great opportunity to learn how to set things up with API's. Thanks for the tip.

ahhhh its the change address issue. I see. So they think that if they send a small portion of their bitcoins from that address, that the rest will stay in the address on the paper when in fact its sitting in a change address which they subsequently fail to look after. That makes a lot of sense to be fair. Cheers - didn't think of that.

I'm honestly not looking for an argument here. I just tire of hearing about market manipulation everytime someone buys or sells a boatload of bitcoin.

Relax. Real money (gold or dollars or btc) is morally neutral. No one cares if the money in their pocket was once used in a crime. And 'investors' (speculators?) need to learn that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Quick question from a doofus. If I can send but not receive, how do I get money into the wallet to send? Can I import a private key still?
To offer a possible answer to my own question. Can I send and receive on the base layer, but only send on the lightning layer? I'm out of my depth and I love it. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:03:16
I could see you were asking the tough questions as well about scaling. Good to see the devs (was it snow?) happy to engage in a conversation about it. There are some negatives I see: Network stability hasn't been great for factom recently, and that's with far less activity than they're hoping to achieve. They've always been pretty slow with releases too, so who knows when we'll be ready for M3. That said, its a great dev team and a great use case, with a business oriented mindset.

Just to be clear, the funds aren't ''transferred'' to a watch only wallet. All the watch only wallet is really doing is looking up the state of the wallet balance on a block explorer. If you still have the main wallet then you have no problems at all. You've got the private keys after all. Contact blockchain.info support if you're really confused.

If I was you, I'd go to  and find information on the daily volume of the big exchanges. You might be able to get some idea how much is speculation there. Most bitcoin speculation takes place in the altcoin market, and one of the biggest (probably the biggest now I think) is poloniex. They seem to trade anywhere between 30000 and 100000 btc daily, and its pretty much all speculation.

This happened to me the other day with electrum. Exactly this. In the end, I just had to bide my time. Eventually the wallet ''received'' the coins back and I spent them again. It then listed them on blockchain.info as a possible double spend, but because I paid the (much bigger) fee manually the second time it was the second transaction that was accepted. 
Basically just wait it out. Everything will be ok. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:04:24
so basically, presuming I have this correct, this is actually very good news if you were sending from your own wallet to polo. You'll have it magically reappear hopefully as it appears the fee you paid was pretty small.

I agree; to be fair, some folks over at IBM have understood the importance right from the start. Check out this interview from a couple of years ago - 
But to what extent will central banks want to 'let go' of controlling the money supply? Will they be using the blockchain but without a cap on the total limit of coins? And how will mining work? Lots of questions and many of those answers will fundamentally change the model which bitcoin set up. Who knows what lies ahead......

The electrum wallet has a nice guide that explains how to 'split' your [coins](

its not that it takes the coin ages to get there, its just that you can't use the wallet till its 'caught up' with what's going on - but the effect is the same. Funnily enough I downloaded the blockchain about a week ago. It took about a week with the computer continuously on to download it. The only way to shortcut this is to import the private keys from that wallet to another wallet. How desperate are you to get the cash? It shouldn't be too difficult. You have access to the wallet.dat regardless of the blockchain not being synced. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:20:18
Altcoin -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Fiat. Time for cashing out I guess. When bitcoin resolves the scaling debate, altcoins will hurt too and the smart traders know this. Basically, there's not so much to look forward to in the altcoin world - on a short term (3 months) time frame anyway.

There are lots of very good suggestions on this thread. If I was in your shoes I'd start with his computers, look for bitcoin wallets on there (typing 'bitcoin' into the search bar would not be a bad place to start) and also if you can access his email (possible if he's saved username and password on his comp) then you can find out where he bought them. As tldr-hodl stated, there's a fair chance he just left them on the exchange, in which case your best bet is to find out which exchange and email them regarding the query. You'll almost certainly need to provide proof that your story is indeed true. But if he's holding onto his own private keys I think you've actually got a better chance of getting access to the funds. Look for some kind of little notebook or something like that where he might store passwords or seed phrases.

What amazes me is that people needed an organisation called the 'blockchain transparency institute' to tell them the obvious. I mean, when the top ten exchanges by volume are all exchanges you've never ever heard of, its pretty clear what's going on. 
What's worth adding is that most of these exchanges also actively trade against their customers. I can't prove this as I only have anecdotal evidence from my own very sad trading history on these exchanges, but when you short a coin with a dead market (xrp when it was approx 1000 sats and doing nothing) and pretty much the second after you place the trade, a massive move is made, stopping you out of your position, only for the market to subsequently become mysteriously dead again, you walk away and you don't come back.

When I first got into bitcoin in 2013, our hashrate was more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined. Since then, the hash rate has increased by x100000. No other cryptocurrency comes remotely close to this; the hash rate determines just how difficult it is to ''break'' the network with a double spend or similar attack. That's what's unique. Could it change in the future? Unlikely, given how much money has been invested creating application specific integrated circuits - not to mention how much has been invested developing the rest of the ecosystem. I understand that to outsiders, this looks like a classic ponzi pump n dump. But learn a bit about it. Ask yourself what's likely to happen in the future. And plan accordingly.

Lightning network works fine to me. Far cheaper and quicker to transact than on chain. It takes time for adoption to take place, a long time. But the jump up in price will happen in a far shorter time frame. Its always been like that with bitcoin, for as long as I can remember. Hash rate, transaction volume, wallet addresses and google trend data all creep up continuously, then someone with deep pockets dives in the shallow pond and splash......x10 just like that. Keep an eye on the important metrics.

The difficulty isn't reducing as far as I'm aware, so its not getting any easier to mine the coins. But the price of each coin is down recently (but up massively from the start of the year). I think this is the market punishing the participants in conflict. I own bitcoins but I'm quite happy to hold and watch the value drop while we flush out a few bad actors. Suits me fine.

Tether hasnt been around that long and for us europeans, its totally irrelevant. If you want to know the price in real us dollars, go to bitstamp where they price it in real us dollars. They used to say bitcoin was artificially inflated by tethers which were printed out of thin air, but the recent new york attornet general actions prove that tether had at least 850 million real us dollars. Dont get me wrong, the recent case could possibly bring the price down - but it will be because one of the biggest exchanges has gone bust, thanks to the banking system freezing it out and forcing it to do business in panama. 
 Let the day traders worry about the price. We'll still be here in twenty years. Lets see where the price is then.

@_date: 2019-05-15 18:43:07
That last sentence needs a source and I strongly suspect its false. Practically every altcoin (and bitcoin) suffers from fake transaction data. What is a fake transaction? Well its a transaction which really never needed to be made. Wash trading, spam attacks, and just general trading inflate bitcoins transaction volume to a level well above where it should be, making it sound bigger than it is to the uncritical eye. Ask a thousand people from a random sample if they've used bitcoin or paypal (or both) in the last year and you'll see paypal come out miles ahead. And I say this as a bitcoin fanatic. The fact is that bitcoin is still in its infancy, and to have 8 million dollars on lightning, when its principle use case is micropayments is a real success - especially when you consider the majority of nodes have had to download the full btc blockchain and in many cases, learn a lot of stuff they didn't know to get it up and running. Crypto isn't as big as you think it is, trading crypto maybe, but using crypto in the real world to buy stuff? Its very very early days.

@_date: 2016-07-26 20:49:56
Its about how quickly the difficulty adjusts. If its very slow like in bitcoin (2 to 4 weeks) then the weaker chain must die (no profit from mining it). But if it happens fast like it does in ethereum (faster blocks = quicker time adjusting) then the weaker chain has a chance. I think gavin was talking about bitcoin.

Do you mean the seed phrase which is your private key? Or the password you use to encrypt most wallets. Who 'gave' you the long ass password? A password manager or the wallet itself?

So as I understand it P2PKH addresses were introduced to mitigate against the threat of Shor's Algorithm [source]( Naturally Early wallets that remain untouched are threatened by this. But I would just look upon this process as a new kind of mining. It will become a race to brute force those wallets and grab the funds. Obviously this would affect inflation (possibly quite seriously - I wonder how many old P2PK non zero balances there are out there!). I'd like to hear more though about this new type of mathematics that only quantum computers can use. Could you point me to a paper so I can look into it. As far as I understand things, quantum computing is just capable of a lot more calculations per second. But I'm always happy to learn.

Centralisation doesn't make your cryptographic schemes immune to bruteforce attacks. 
There are already plenty of quantum resistant cryptographic schemes which could be used in place of ecdsa. Unfortunately, I believe that currently none of the signature algorithms available are very compact - they all rely on large signatures and this is could be a genuine problem. But if we can build quantum computers with ease, I expect we could probably handle bigger signatures. 
Bottom line is that quantum computing will not 'break' encryption forever. It just takes it to the next level.

Hardware wallets have their own drawbacks. Its on the front page right now.

I think you're all bang on the money. Under a rational analysis, you'd expect mining pools to (a) create drama and uncertainty in the market, front-running all announcements (b) profit. 
But the beauty is that no one benefits from a catastrophic chain split. And if enough of the pools not directly controlled by Bitmain act in their own interest, we will have segwit.

(1) next time you go outside to a shop/restsurant or wherever, count how many phone zombies you see. The internet is everywhere now. For good or bad, youll never escape it. 
(2) electricity is inconvenient if you live in a faraday cage, but for everyone else its fine. 
(3) zero confs are accepted pretty much everywhere for small value transactions. Its limited risk. Cheques used to bounce too but it didnt stop them being used. 
(4) Fees are an order of magnitude smaller than using debit cards and its the merchants who currently swallow those fees. 
With regard to your second point, similar approaches are used by banks and crypto wallets to guard against hacking. They both use 2 factor authentication to prevent funds being stolen, with varying degrees of success. The one big difference though is you share your private key (credit card number) with every merchant you use, whereas with bitcoin you only share your public key. Banks stomach the cost of fraud. With bitcoin, the responsibility is yours.....

Edit: And download a wallet as well. I like electrum, but there are many many others to choose from.

Vol of eth trading is 90% of bitcoin - if u ignore the fact that all bitcoin volume is against fiat, whereas 90% of eth vol is against bitcoin.

Ok great job - this croupier is lightning fast on the deal! I'm up 20000 sats, raking it in - just need to make it to 80000 sats so I have enough for one more month of vps! Couple of comments. For some reason, firefox is not loading your webpage correctly - could be a problem at my end though. Secondly, the dealer always offers you the option to hit on 21. A good croupier would never let you take a card on 21......

Whilst I understand and agree with your concerns regarding the kind of information supplied on coinmarketcap, I still think its down to the buyer to complete their 'due diligence' and properly research these issues for themselves. I remember ripple used to be listed on coinmarketcap and then disappeared after many complained. I quick check of the bitcointalk forums was all that was needed to see that the coin was held in low regard by many in the movement on account of the the issues already stated. That said, I like the look of the new site so I will use both.....

sounds like a great idea to me. The more options people have to spend their bitcoins the better.

This is the reason why centralisation of mining is bad. It creates a situation where its very easy for miners to game the market. And that's what is happening right now. 
Edit: its the one thing which makes me think maybe changing the POW is the only way to go.

Ok so if you attempted this approach, you would always be running negative due to the difference between the bid and the ask on bitmex. You might just as well use usdt or usdc or some other approach which will still cause you to run negative, but will shield you from volatility.

I don't quite think this poster is as 'revolutionist' as you claim. Taking power away from banks is a commonplace theme in most mainstream media articles. The last few years have demonstrated the dangers of allowing a few private institutions to run the financial system, and bitcoin could quite logically be seen as a grass-roots response to the failure of these institutions, in much the same way as the internet could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction to the media monopolies of the 1990's. But still its not what I would call anarchy. More like democracy.

Other metals have been used, just as other cryptocurrencies have been used. But gold remains king. Why? Because of unique chemical properties? Nope. Intrinsic value? Nope. Network effects.

Firstly, coinmarketcap is not to blame - Anyone who trades cryptographic currencies needs this information when they trade on the exchanges. If you don't like a coin, don't buy it! I never look at the list like a 'league table of football teams'. More a collective hallucination of value, which is a sensible way of understanding any currency. It is simply a list of prices on current exchanges for each coin. Personally I'm no fan of ripple or next, I'm a worldcoin buyer. But we will see in a year or even ten years time, which coin triumphs. And all that will decide it is the collective opinions of everyone. In this way, money is the democratic principle, par excellence....

Bots dominate day trading because they can execute trades faster, but the strategies they use aren't really any different to the strategies a human would use, albeit more slowly.

EOS has 21 nodes most of which are run by shifty exchanges, with hq in the cayman islands for tax purposes. It claims to do bazillions of transactions per second (almost certainly not true) whilst being decentralised (utterly false) and censorship resistant (laughable). It was created by Dan Larimer, serial altcoin creator (bitshares, steam, eos...) and funded by that fella from the mighty ducks who's pretending he bought mt gox. 
Like most altcoins, its price is almost completely dependent on altcoin exchange market makers who will continue to use inside info from the order book to roast small time margin traders. Dump that pile of shit.

How is this related to results becoming more accurate in experiments where more trials are repeated? Thats how I understood the Law of Large Numbers.

You are right and wrong at the same time. Its true that the current economic system has evolved to offer greater benefits *to the richest in society*.

Personally I would buy from a range of exchanges over a number of days, so that I better understand how the trades are completed. Also, if the price suddenly drops like a stone and you feel you have to sell, you will already be signed up to a number of places that will sell your bitcoins for you.
