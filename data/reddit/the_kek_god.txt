Oh, I still use coinbase to cash out but i store my actual coins on a Nano Ledger S.

I told my friends once I was in crypto. Never again. I told them I cashed it all out for tax reasons this year. (Hint: i didnt). 
Its not cool when you are playing a friendly game of cards for $1 chips, then I lose, and then they say "why you leaving, you just made $1,000 in the last week on crypto".
The common person sees this boom as easy money but they are all forgetting to cash out because FOMO. We are in the next dotcom bubble right now. When it comes falling down and nobody can cash out of coinbase (the common man is using coinbase) crypto is going to take a serious blow.

We are going to hit 100k by end of year at this rate.

Sold half last week so I "lost" a lot already. Oh well, im seriously debating about selling the rest today. If these prices are real then the hodlers deserve their rewards. If they are fake then ill buy some more back at 10k.

Someone sold 100k ethereum once for any price. Everyone down to pennies got their orders fulfilled. Price was nothing and then back to normal a minute later. It was quite fun to watch.

Nano Ledger S is what i use. There are offline wallets you can use but the Nano is the safest IMO.

 Yep, our only guess was someone either has too much money or fat fingered it.
