I feel ya on that one. I can't risk any of my time or money on it yet. 
If I had to guess, I would say that the majority of people  on LN mainnet are sick and tired of the bullshit controls on us and so excited about LN that they are willing to take the risks. I hope that the LN team is able to use the data from the inevitable problems that occur from using LN before it's ready for release. 
We need to maximize the benefit from ppl using LN on mainnet as much as we can.

BTC has changed, significantly. 
The innovation in Bitcoin is unprecedented in history. BTC has changed very significantly. Segwit, and the sucessful shrugging off of multiple attacks are examples...The landscape has changed as well.


by what metrics, and whose judgement? 
According to the markets BTC  is 14-16X better than a year ago 


profrssional investors are not necessarily technically qualified to understand BTC. 


BTC is not a company. Crypto is an entirely new asset class, and  BTC is an entirely different animal than any other currency or store of value that has ever existed. You can't apply all the rules of valuing companies to BTC and expect the output data to be useful across the board, if at all.

There is no definitive answer to this. Markets are very complicated things. 
The best you can do, imo, is to educate yourself as much as you can about whatever facets of Bitcoin that you feel are pertinent to your question, so you can have the best informed opinion possible for you at that moment.

If you wait for "Bug free" nothing will ever happen. "bug free' is not binary, its a continuum, and every iteration moves us closer to bug free, but we don't know how good something is until its tested.  
Testnet can only go so far, b\c until real money is on the line, you are not getting a true test of security, and the amount of money on the line defines how hard its gonna get poked by 'hackers'.
I think the people who are going out and skinning their knees using  dangerous skateboard of LN on mainnet are helping a lot, but there is a dance between enough people risking real money for the testing to be of value in certain ways, and too many people risking too much money where catastrophic failure would cause a tipping point to be reached in the confidence of new and potential users.

Ok, I will be the turd in the punchbowl here. 
It is possible (NOT saying likely, I have no idea how likely it is) that the backstory here is a cover story, or trolling. If its a cover story, the potential for real loss to someone is great.
  There is no point in posting theories about how it **could be** a cover story. 
If it is not, one would hope the OP would understand that people may want to know they were not helping someone do something nefarious. 
So, that said, dear OP,  I;m sorry to ask more of you at a time that could be the most difficult of your life, but can you offer some proof as to your situation, so that people can be more assured in offering you help?
If you can, I for one, would be more than willing to talk you through recovering your wallet on the phone, which would be much easier than following steps online.
THAT SAID, DO NOT GIVE OUT ANY PIN NUMBERS OR SERIES OF WORDS TO ANYONE...NOT ME, NOT ANYONE.

prices of a lot of things are influenced heavily by speculation, manipulation and other non-value related factors, though.
It seems to me that w\ Bitcoin being such a small player relative to the entire world market, it would be even more susceptible to these things than say, gold, for example. And gold is clearly being manipulated out of proportion to its real value.

He and his men killed untold thousands of native americans. From his own journals:
“*They … brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things… They willingly traded everything they owned…  They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features…. They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane… . They would make fine servants…. With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.”*

Yes, I could not agree more.  
Your statement rings true far beyond just LN.  With such massive paradigm shifts underway, its easy to get carried away and ignore fundamentals. I sometimes struggle myself with this.  It is made more difficult by the fact that we live in a culture of marketing, where our primary sources of info have vested interests in glossing over challenges/downsides in order to sell us something (ex: "Roundup kills pesky weeds!"  while it really should say "Roundup kills any plant not genetically engineered to survive it, sterilizes the soil microbiome, and causes cancer!")
Pain *is* the best teacher sometimes, though.
Thanks for the well articulated reminder.  The motivation it provides will be helpful, b\c in the beginning, learning about these fundamentals seems like a **lot** more work, while the risks of not doing the foundational work and the rewards of doing it seem like distant semi fictions.

Straight up numbers with a label denoting the unit of measure being used at that time seem best to me. Offers the most flexibility wrt units of display (which is a moving target at the moment...ppl are not yet at the point where there is agreement on the best unit of measure due to volatility)  and straight up numbers are less confusing to newbies, who are the target audience. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:34:35


Theres the perceived legitimacy issue, and the confusion issue.

your q is too general to be answerable. If you have a more specific q, fire away (no promises that I can help, but I will try)
I am working to learn about it all myself. At first I was *completely* overwhelmed and still get that way sometimes, but the only way forward for me was to just google/youtube search and start reading/watching things that jumped out at me.

There will always be entities that are willing to take the risks associated with running afoul of the law. 
There will be an explosion of entities to take coinbases place. Some may only offer some of the same services, but the market will not allow a vacuum when there is so much money to be made.

Well said. Thank you for posting that. It can help me articulate it in the future.
It also bolsters  my own feelings about ways to help decondition ourselves. .. when I see someone being unabashedly *themselves*, or even abashedly themself...it makes me more brave to do the same.
That means I can help the world move forward by making putting the real me out there a daily practice. Its scary and difficult sometimes, and it's easy to fall back into a (false) "comfort zone" , so it is really helpful to be reminded. 
Another, less wordy way of expressing this sentiment that I saw recently is, "The more a person represses or denies their own true feelings, the easier they are to manipulate."
I guess another way to say that would be "The one tries to conform, the easier to manipulate they become."
I'm not even sure how it was originally phrased when I first saw it, to be honest...the sentiment is a good thing to spread though, imo.


I think I would do well to focus on that part more..the gaining of potential fun motivates me alot more (sometimes) than the fear of being manipulated, etc. thanks again, man.

This is getting into more unfamiliar waters, for me. But based on my current understanding (ie. don't take this as gospel):
They can structure who owns what and how it's distributed more or less any way they want. 
If the above is true, it's important to factor in that, through malice or incompetence (or bad luck, etc) it may appear that a structure is set up one way, but might look another from a given perspective.

I view it more as a contribution than a challenge to them, btw. It can be both, of course. I just prefer to put that foot forward, b\c "contribution" feels better to me.

extra complexity is not a feature- how does the multi chain lose here?

If they get the result they need from a system, that system is a viable option for them. They dont care how it works under the hood, as long as it works. Just like most people dont know or care how the processor in their computer or phone works, and dont care.


valid point. There would need to be cross chain swaps. It would seem to me that if all parallel chains had the same consensus rules, that might help with the trust (trustless) factor. I have no clue what the details of it could be, its just an idea. "Parallel processing with uniform consensus rules across chains"


Again, *from the users perspective* it does not matter. 
It's just a germ of an idea.  Maybe it could evolve into something useful, maybe not.  Even Bitcoin had some serious flaws in the beginning.

I see a number of potential benefits, from a marketing perspective.
The first 3 that come to mind are:
Brand awareness (A ***much*** more powerful thing than most realize)
FOMO, as previously mentioned
It highlights the fundamental differences between what the national debt # means, and it's implications on those (forced into) the USD system, and what the "coins left to be mined"  means/implies for users.  This tends to have the effect of sparking varying levels of independent thought (and even independent research in some cases). 
This idea is damn good marketing, and since the "product" being pushed here is based in truth and justice, and is competing with deception and manipulation, I think it's damn good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:37:44

Im with you on the rest, but this analogy is a bit off. Crap food (Assuming we are talking about toxic food here vs good tasting, etc...maybe I should not make that assumption) is less expensive primarily due to economies of scale of industrial scale food production, subsidies, and other factors that essentially externalize the true cost of production of the food. 
All things being equal, a bunch of fresh organic kale should cost significantly less than a bag of cheetos, but the system has been gamed by the frankenfood industries.

I wish U.S. Americans were more like that. 
Please don't judge us too harshly, though. This culture is one that tells us from before birth (literally) that we are not enough, and that the only path to self acceptance and social acceptance is finding and buying the right products, and conforming to the right clique, etc.  
This is, of course, insane, but when one js born into a culture like this, the programming goes deep.

Good insights, all.


I wonder if it would be a viable option for scaling small coins that can't scale otherwise for them to fork themselves, and implement changes on all forked coins simultaneously from there on. (ie Monero chain1, Monero chain2, etc, all being identical, but just on different chains)
The user woudn't care what chain of Monero they were on, as from the users perspective, it doesn't matter. It would only matter if you got down to the deeper levels of operation (mining, nodes, etc). This could maybe maximize the benefits of a smaller coin.
Put another way, the idea would be that even the name or brand of the coin itself is decentralized.

The sentiment is this:
whatever a system incentivizes (actually the word is "incents", but that one gets misinterpreted a lot) ...whatever a system incents, will tend to happen more and more over time. This is a universal truth. No amount of "If we keep the system and just try harder" or "keep the system and get rid of *this* group" will stop whatever a system incents from manifesting more and more over time.
The system of breeding animals and selling them incents people to make short cuts, and lie to themselves and others and ignore/deny the obvious fact that humans intervening in the normal mating process of animals with the intent of creating more "better" animals results in more "throw away" animals.
The problem is that there are more dogs than there are homes.

No, not really. The bred dog was created on purpose, to fill a market. The rescue dog happened naturally.  Buying bred animals perpetuates and fuels the breeding of more dogs.


No, that's not true.
Generally speaking, mixed breed dogs are genetically superior to dogs whose natural selection has become completely guided by the hand of humans.  As a result, mixed breed dogs, generally speaking are easier to train, and have less health problems.
You of course would want to choose a dog that naturally has the inclinations you are looking for, but assuming that the stated intent of breeders is both a)n their actual intent and b) successfully achieving the intent (in this case, specific traits) makes no sense. ..as an analogy...going from an older operatingh system on your computer to a newer one, is not always an "upgrade" regardless of the version number. Similarly, a "pure"bred dog is not automatically better at *anything* than a well chosen rescue dog. 


I stand by my original statement. There is no such thing as a responsible breeder. They are feeding a and perpetuating a system that perpetuates and inculcates not only "dog racism", but the deaths of all dogs who cant find a home because they are not "pure"

 Not hard to imagine a scenario where they threaten him or his loved ones with violence, and tell him that he better convince everyone to use bcash or else. Roger would then have little choice but to do pretty much exactly what he has been doing, because the facts are not on his side, and unless he can't do basic math, he knows it. 
Compare that to his early interviews. He was sane. 
If you were the bad guys looking at how to attack Bitcoin, getting Roger to preach the gospel of a shitcoin attempting to centralize crypto and replace Bitcoin int eh public mind, this would be a logical strategy. It's the only scenario that really makes sense to me.

Oxymoron. They are part of the problem, even of they take good care of the dogs in their care. 30,000 dogs PER DAY get euthanized in the US alone, for lack of homes. PER FUCKING DAY. Buying a dog takes a home away from these dogs. Every breeder that breeds dogs should have to go work at the high kill shelters and euthanize 1 dog for every one they bring into the world. Then at least they have to work harder to live in their denial about how they contribute to the mass killing of dogs.

The term "intrinsic value" is an oxymoron. Things have value because people agree they do, or because they have practical uses, like commodity monies.
Bitcoin is, however, based on something "real". The electricity staked by miners in the process of doing their part to secure the network is real, and it is generally considered valuable by many.  Looking at Bitcoin as being backed by electricity is not an inaccurate way to look at it.

I misunderstood your initial point...it sounds like we agree that the energy used to secure the Bitcoin network (mining) is not wasted at all.
I think there is, however, room for stacking some benefits on it...like using the heat produced by mining for productive purposes.
If I had the money, I would build apartment complexes where the basement of each building contained a mining farm that contributed to heating the building and hot water for the building....also, greenhouses in really cold climates that were heated by mining. Imagine fresh local produce in mischigan in the middle of winter...REALLY fresh, REALLY local. Why not, right?

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:12
ALL breeders, "good" by your standards or not, have a conflict of interest....this in the big picture, is a massive issue. People being responsible with and caring for their animals (i.e., spaying/neutering, properly training, etc) is of course the ultimate goal, but saying that people *who are in the business* of making more dogs are not responsible *for there being more dogs in the world* is plain old bullshit, and completely illogical.
Should people spay and neuter? Yes, I believe so. Does the fact that some don't absolve people *who are in the business* of making more dogs for their role in *putting more dogs in the world*? Of course not. 


No, I mean when dogs fuck based on their instincts, not on some idiot deciding he knows better than nature and in one way or another forces them to fuck....trying to shift focus onto another group is what you are doing here.  


based on what? Heresay? The word of someone with a conflict of interests (like some nbreeder who is in denial wrt their own motives, drives, and desires?) If you have data, please present it. Raw data, please, btw. Not something pre-spun b the AKC, et al.


Says who? You? You have done this exact experiment? You state this as though its even possible to truly test this hypothesis, or as though you have...it's not, and you have not, not in any meaningful true A/B double blind study kinda way.....because it is not possible to do so, due to (as one example) the impossibility of finding **objective** "Harder to train" "Easier to train" data in the first place. 


please provide references for this assertion. I do not believe this, based on over 40 years as a dog trainer, 15 of them professionally.
In my experience, "pure bred" dogs are harder to train.  I have theories as to why, but I am not going to speculate. That has been my experience. It is real world experience gained over a long time.  


One can only definitively say it's an upgrade if one knows all factors involved between the (assumedly 2) things being compared. There is no way to control for all the variables between human intervened animal breeding and naturally occurring breeding. There are too many unknowns.
re the AKC The very existence of the organization itself causes an irreparable conflict of interest wrt their trustworthiness as a source of info....not saying everything they say is bullshit, buuuuuut...
Conflicts of interest are a motherfucker, btw....the "bias blind spot" seems to be a common thing, in my experience, although cognitive bias in general is clearly at play, based on the evidence (should you be interested in ridding yourself of cognitive biases, I strongly encourage learning about them...although it's a bit painful discovering ones own faults in this way, it's worth it, imo. It's the only way I know of to rid oneself of these habits). An example of a bias that could blindside someone were if (hypothetically, of course) you were a breeder, or (hypothetically, of course) had bought dogs from breeders before, you would be cognitively inclined to see the good in that, and not the bad. It takes a lot of effort to see past these things.

You have provided zero examples for either as of yet....you are making the accusation, it's on you to substantiate it. Direct links to tweets, please, no screencaps (obvious reasons)
If all you do is throw out more unsubstantiated and baseless stuff, my unanswered q from before being an example of the former, and your most recent q being an example of the latter.( i.re, in the latter, I said nothing even similar to what you are implying I said),  I can find no point in continuing to spend my energy trying to have a productive conversation with you.

I haven't checked your info out (other than a quick prince lookup just now),  but I think it's certainly believable. 
Going by BTC price history, that by no means constitutes "a serious problem", though. 
If that was Dec 22 2017  (on the chart I looked at, which may have been made with different data sets than your source, of course) , that day started with BTC going for ~14,150 USD,  the price got all the way down to $11,885.50, and then later hit the all day high of $14,913.70 . That 24 hour period ended with the BTC price at ~14,559 USD for one BTC.
BTC price rebounded and ended the day higher than it started after the dump
I cannot come up with any combination of scenarios where someone could dump 111,000 BTC on the market without the market responding in a similar fashion.
I'm not saying it's impossible, but the deeper my understanding of markets in general, and of the BTC market gets, the more certain I am that BTC would bounce right back after an event like the one we are talking about.

Good point. A person needs to hold their own keys to really be in possession of the funds. If there is an exchange between the user and their keys, the user does not hold their keys, and is therefore vulnerable to said fuckery.
 That goes without saying for many, but many at this point in the evolution of crypto also still need to be informed about it.
so, with that in mind, a more refined version of my previous statement would be something like," *Holding your own private keys for  BTC removes the possibility of this fuckery .*"
Which makes me wonder how a reserve currency, with many users holding their own private keys (Which seems to be where we are going) could work .  I mean, reserve currencies are traditionally "reserved" by institutions and governments, whereas software, users and networks will take over some or all of those functions...like in side-chains. 
Fascinating shit.
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:18:23


Bitcoin has many advantages over gold such as:
Mega-portability, gold is very hard to transport, which of course is one of the things that led to paper money in the first place, which led to fiat...this becomes very important when currency controls are in place, which is one of the things that is really common when a state issued currency collapses. 
 Currently divisible to 8 decimal places, off chain solutions make it more divisible still. Gold is very cumbersome to divide. 
BTC can be verified as real without the need for very expensive equipment and expertise, unlike gold. (See the recent case of tungsten filled gold bars for an example of the verification of custodial held gold being partially fake if you want a very recent real world example)
It is possible to store large amounts of Bitcoin very securely, thus negating the necessity of custodial accounts for those willing to do the work. The custodial accounts of gold, historically have often (and some do still, to be sure) claim to have more gold than they do, and/or tell multiple parties that they each have exclusive ownership of specific gold. Bitcoin makes it possible to store wealth without a vault, etc, or a custodial account
Gold is very hard to hide, especially in large amounts. You can memorize a mnemonic seed for a particular set of Bitcoin private keys. Those keys can hold any amount of bitcoin.
there are more, but I am getting tired.


Thats your answer? Really? You not only know what 'most people' say, (actually, no, you don't..that is a lot of polling), but you know what they are really thinking? 
last thing I will address :


Well, you are assuming I have adopted it as a currency, which I did not initially. 
I bought bitcoin when I was going through a financial shitstorm, and did not know if I was going to be able to hang on to ANY money, even though the shitstorm was because of financial predation on me, BECAUSE I am financially "poor"...because that is how the system works.
So I bought Bitcoin to put it somewhere that might be out of the reach of the fucking parasites. It turned out that at least a few laws were not written by their lobbyists, and I didn't have to put it there. Thank god I did, though. Because it appreciated in value enough to save my life....I have a very serious medical condition, and because (yet another) lawyer fucked me over, I ended up homeless. Because of the appreciation of Bitcoin, I have been able to rent a place to live, and try to heal my body.
It's almost all gone now, and Im not sure where I am going to live when it runs out, but I at least have built a network of friends, so my prospects are better than they were before. I literally have ~$200 worth of BTC left now.
So I DID buy it as a store of value, as a matter of fact, and it saved my fucking life..  
I'm gonna stop replying to you now. Be well.

It's totally possible that market manipulation can happen. I honestly believe it's happening right now.
The fuckery of which I speak is specifically the fuckery of the reserve-rs saying that they have more of the reserve currency than they do, and the kind where they basically give multiple parties "exclusive" ownership of the same physical gold.  Both of those have occurred many times throughout history.
People can, of course, \*say\* they have more Bitcoin in a custodial account (Like an exchange, for example), but as I stated in one of my other replies in this thread, holding ones own private keys removes the possibility of what Nation States, etc, have done in the past with reserve currencies.
Now that I think about it, the fuckery of which I speak  is/are examples of Nation States, etc, effectively double (or more than double) spending gold they **do** have  (granting "ownership" to multiple parties) and/or spending gold that they **never actually owned in the first place** ("phantom spending"?),[like when they discover that what they thought was gold was gold fileld with tungssten](

The author is not correct in this. 
Yes, for sure, eery sell theoretically exerts downward pressure on price.
2 issues with that, or at the very least one that more or less guarantees it wouldn't be a"serious problem" if someone dumped 11K BTC
 I don't know exqctly how much of a "serious problem" an instantaneous sell of 111K BTC would affect price, it might be less or more than what many would call "a serious problem". Other people may know how to do that math, and I would be interested in that, buuuuuut
Regardless, it would take a while to sell it all, and as the price dipped a lot of people would be buying that dip, which brings the price back up.

\&gt;His point still stands, then.
If the point was that it was gold and not a country's currency that was *considered* the reserve, yeah, but the chart is a bit vague, really.  It could be referring to whoever controlled the gold. Can't really tell by the chart.
If we wanted to get pedantic about it, though, gold itself can't be a reserve currency because it's not currency, it's money. They are actually 2 different things.
I was kind of assuming that the "much of the displayed time" comment referred to how national currencies were backed by gold, though, which I think is probably accurate.
Still, currency backed by gold is not the same as gold being a reserve currency, strictly speaking.

@_date: 2018-09-26 21:04:23
oh yeah, it wouldn't be that easy to buy all the BTC available, btw. As the buy up occurred, the buying pressure would:
1)  Definitely drive the price up drastically, that is how markets work
and that would likely:
 2) cause more people to buy as it did in the Dec 2017 run up, which would drive the price up farther, making it more expensive to buy more as the process went on.
Also, there is a lot of BTC in cold storage, meaning it is not immediately for sale at any price. Some people will take some or all out of cold storage and sell it when the price gets high enough, to be sure. But there is also a good case to be made for HODLing if/when the price goes up like this, and if history is any guide, many will.
Add to that the fact that miners literally get BTC before anyone else, and can decide to HODL or sell it and there is little that anyone can do about it (although I do believe that entities have already targeted and coerced the biggest centralized miners, mining is not completely centralized, so some of the new BTC that comes into existence as a result of block rewards is likely to not be for sale, either.)
There is more to that story, I am sure, but that is the 10,000 foot view

Thousands, actually


I think Bitcoin will largely, but not absolutely, replace gold as a store of value. It's not a zero sum game, and for some, gold will remain their preferred/best store of value, or a partial one, imo.


bitcoin was in fact invented as "digital gold", litecoin as the "silver to bitcoins gold"

I probably should have waited to read the link you sent until my brain had reset (I hit the wall for today already, can't process too well until at least tomorrow)...I just tried to read it again, and I can't really parse it atm...but it seems exciting, but it is that how to for testnet only?

This process is, in my experience, best viewed as exercises in the following:
1) Committing only what you can afford ***to  do without***. I phrase it that way specifically. How you frame it in your mind directly affects how you process it (i.e., as a source of multiple benefits, or as a source of potential loss). 
2) (this relates strongly to the second half of  An exercise in acceptance of what you cannot control.
3) motivation for learning more about what you can control....this mainly relates to your strategies of investing....
Finally, for me, the "investing" strategy that works out emotionally AND mathematically to the degrees I prefer is just buying and HODLing. 
In summary, this whole thing ends up being not only an opportunity to make money and safeguard your financial future but also offers continual learning and skill at developing yourself as a person, if you can find the frame(s) and strateg(ies) that fit for you. 
I find that The more I accept what is, and strive to better my skills in the process of facing challenges, the stronger I become, and better at the "game" of money, and of crypto I become. (Very Bitcoin-esque, that last)
It doesn't erase the pain of the "downsides", but the "downsides" are basically your tuition, that at least sometimes also pays you back in ways beyond education.

rushing to judging=done thinking about it
they are "incompetent" in a way that just so happens to incentivize people leaving money in their accounts.... certain financial institutions do this, too....
For ex: those Visa, etc gift cards are more complicated to use than just using a regular debit card or credit card, and if you have a small amount left on one, whatever small is to you, and its a PITA to use it, you are more likely to just leave it on the card. 
If a company benefits from people leaving money in any kind of account, whether its an active decision or strategy or not, it amounts to a hidden tax or fee on the user.
 It's super telling about the culture of an organization when you notice things like this.

That part, I could not agree more. 


I think theres plenty of room for a lot of 'right' messages.  One in my OP and in the docus where they mention the current USD value of the papa johns pizzas that I see is "Bitcoin has value". Its a very easily relatable story, too. From a marketing/mythology standpoint, it's got some really redeeming qualities.
Whats the/a right message, in your view? 
(Re below, Me PRADDLING ON WARNING...my post, tho, so screw it, here I go....)
About the part we agree on, the deeper I get wrt my understanding of Bitcoin, the more amazed at the nested layers of brilliance of design. I am routinely taken aback, again and again, at how good the design is (Not necessarily the state of it at this moment,  but rather the "1000 foot view" from multiple 1000 foot perspectives)
Maybe because of my high level of Awe of Bitcoin, I genuinely pondered for a bit if whoever bought those pizzas had, on some level, suspected or even known the potential future significance of it before doing it.
At the end of the day, I think I am probably just romanticizing BTC....but mythology can be helpful, too, right? I mean, like how much better is it that we don't know who Satoshi is/was? From a cultural standpoint, its definitely a great thing, imo....it would (again, imo) tarnish the shine of BTC in the public mind if the creator of BTC was known to be just some regular people(s), and I believe there would be a very active campaign to besmirch his/her/their reputation by the forces of evil if everyone knew who Satoshi was. In our ego driven culture, that would reflect badly on BTC to many people, and if history is any indication, it have real world bad effects on Bitcoin.
Downside is, now I want pizza, and really should not be eatin it...

@_date: 2019-11-20 01:34:57


Sure, sometimes, on a very limited basis, only though.
 it seems to me to be a matter of scale. Once centralization passes a certain point, the concentration of power that results causes major problems. 
Another issue with too much centralization is that it causes a disconnect between the centralized power and the components of the structures it has control over. That is a big part of why oil companies are fine with destroying the Earth, and we, at the far end of the spectrum of power in that system, are actually helping them do it by using so much (fucking) oil.
\&gt;Centralization, like decentralization, is a tactic, a means to an end, not an end goal.  
Thats too much of an oversimplification to be useful, really. For some, in some circumstances, centralizing power in \*their\* hands is exactly the end goal.  
For others, in other circumstances, a quick way to bypass some pain point in a system is their end goal, so they design with a centralized mindset.  There are major problems that come from taking this shortcut though. 
Centralization itself is not inherently bad, it is just a tool, but it is often employed by those who have no grasp of the downstream effects, and there are many, and they are powerful.
I think its more than fair to say that centralization should rarely be the design choice. Right now it is the go-to, and a society that has at large lost the ability to think for themselves is both a symptom and a cause of this.

I'm learning as I go here., but I'm starting to believe you are correct. 
With that in mind, who would benefit from this? 
If Jihan is one of the people, I submit that we, the teeming masses start a website devoted solely to documenting all endeavors in which he has a hand. I suggest this for 2 reasons:
1) So we can factor in his history of lying, etc when making decisions where he is a counterparty
2) So we can actively boycott anything he has anything to do with (As far as we can tell.)
It ain't a perfect strategy, but there needs to be **some** kind of reckoning. The amount of damage he has done/is doing to not only Bitcoin but to the world at large begs for it.

Honestly, I prefer it over coin base, too. I suspect that your $50 clearing issue was on the fiat side, as that is usually the case.
I don't have a problem with the spread being bigger, and agree that the difference in spread can be considered to be the fee. That's all good. WRT to the exchange rate, the lack of clarity is a much bigger problem for me. 
If users try to buy $500 USD of BTC, there should be a summary screen that explains *why* as soon as they confirm the purchase, it shows ~$490 USD wortth of BTC. I don't believe it is a scam, but it sure as shit feels like it when there is no explanation given *before* the user commits to purchasing it....the anger comes from feeling disrespected, essentially.

Love this tool. Thank you for making it.
I do have some feedback. All my feedback is based on a couple assumptions:
1. A primary goal of yours in making this calculator is to sell people on the idea of DCA'ing BTC buys.
2. The 'people' you are trying to reach, primarily, are relative noobs to the benefits of DCA and/or purchasing BTC as an investment.
Coming from that perspective, my suggestions are as follows:
1. make the current interface the non default interface, while still making it available by clicking "advanced interface" or something like that.
2. Make the default interface as noob friendly as possible, which would be to
A) Remove the less common options from the default interface altogether, but still make them available by clicking 'advanced' for ex, the default basic interface should have \*less\* options:
* Default basic investment currency should be hard coded to BTC
* Default basic end date should be hard coded to current date
* Default basic exchange fee should be hard coded to some reasonable value
B) Change the language on the default basic interface to accommodate the noobiest of noobs. They can always  
click "advanced"
* Default basic interface in noob friendly language in the form of a sentence. For ex:
"If you had invested" (base currency symbol, eg "$", etc) (*Regular investment input blank) (base currency code, eg USD, etc) "every" (* *Investment Interval blank*), then as of right now," (*todays date in parentheses*) "you would have made a profit of " (this space would say "click calculate button to find out" until the user clicked 'calculate', at which point it would populate with the output of the calculation")
Then, below that, an asterisk or parenthetical that says something along the lines of "calculation based on exchange fee of (x) and ending on todays date. Click "advanced" to change these variables.
I kind of made up my own coding language there to try to communicate my thoughts. If you want to go down this road as far as UI/UX and would like more input or clarification, please inbox me.
If an overarching goal is to increase adoption by those who understand it less, then those are my thoughts.
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:55:00


I don't know.  Out of my wheelhouse.
From a quick google, it appears that  Nevada does not have state or local capital gains taxes. I would assume there is a federal capital gains tax, though another quick google returned nothing definitive wrt that. That might just be that it is well known enough where it kind of goes without saying for those in the field.

thanks . 
don't you think the interface should reflect the actual price a customer is going to pay when confirming a Tx?  Regardless of what the internal mechanisms are under the hood, it *looks* shady af.
For the record, I don't suspect there is an active attempt by Dorsey/cash app to defraud anyone, but I also don't appreciate what in effect amounts to semi hidden fees, or being given bad info, particularly when the bad info results in the user getting less than what is stated in some way, or is required to, as an above post says "jump through a bunch of hoops" ...if I want to get treated like that, I will just go to a government office or bank ;-)

It's been proven that financial wealth beyond a certain point causes unhappiness and disease. 
I'm not judging, but why do you think humans want to get intoxicated at least to excess? (Seriously, not judging...I am dealing with my own addictions, and the disease that springs from them...tho I was never financially wealthy by US standards) We get wasted, because we try to numb the misery with intoxicants. We are forced to live lives of no meaning by the very machinery of society that we keep running.

I've read of ppl holding their bcash as a weapon in reserve to be sold when pump and dumps happen. 
They might miss out on the "Free money" if bcash goes really close to zero before they dump it, but in the case that actually played out wrt bcash, holding it until it was at/near its high is a way voting against bcash. Its ballsy, but a person could actually fight the good fight, and come out farther ahead than if they had just dumped immediately.

Even when these people were not around b\c I isolated myself, everything had memories associated with it. The house itself, even, b\c I lived there in one very unhealthy relationship.
I think we each have to find our own place. Travel, not as a tourist, as a person looking for a place to move to. Get a feel for it.
I also believe that if you are currently in the northeast USA, or anywhere near NYC, it's not hard to do a lot better. ...but that is my opinion, and I hear brooklyn is amazing, like an island on the island, but each place has pluses and minuses for any given person.
Some places that pop up as immeasurably better *for me* (I can't stress that enough, *for me*) are Austin, TX, Atlanta, GA, Asheville, NC, San Francisco, CA Portland, OR. I'm sure ther are more, but those are the ones I think of. ...*you can't go by my list, though, you gotta build your own.*

Man, so much wisdom in that. This whole thread, actually. 
I have been hodling (sic...hahaha) back from commenting because I could spend my whole day doing so on this thread, but this, apparently, is the one that got me to comment.
Re: the crabs:
yep. I was lucky enough to get messages from (god, the Universe, whatever you wanna call it) that I had to get out of the  bucket I was in. In the situation I was in there, I could not get enough alone time to regroup and process to be sure I was right that these other crabs were in fact pulling me down (because they almost invariably told me that they were actually trying to boost me up...ain't that nice of them?)
Add to that that each crab doing it to (me, in this case) is like the old "boiling a frog" metaphor. 
( 
 People who pull ya down like that are very crafty about it, (consciously or otherwise).

We can do that, too. The proper approach from a marketing standpoint and that is what we are talking about here, and I also see massive value in it from an adoption standpoint long term, is to do it in waves. 
First, we soften them up with a 5 second "WTF was THAT?" ad,(brilliant idea, btw), then we give then something that requires more of their mind time, which we have earned already by doing a 5 second wtf ad.
Marketing is the process of normalizing peoples thoughts wrt a specific thing being "real". That is one thing (of a few) that can help BTC a lot, imo.
...lets do this! 
I can contribute a little money and some time.

YES! 
Look into Narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder or sociopathy for more reading on this type of behavior, if you are so inclined.  
I started looking into NPD because I came across it trying to understand how my family treat(ed) me. It *perfectly* predicted and explained the behavior of my family towards me.  
I have since come to realize that these "b cluster" personality disorders are the natural and normal side effect of living in a society  set up the way ours is (i.e., western culture as it is now which has infected most of the world).
I also came to realize that Bitcoin, with it's potential power to level the playing field, is truly medicine for this incredibly sick and self destructive culture. 
It's not the only medicine we need, but it helps a =whole bunch.
Stay the path of the real decentralized BTC, my friend! YOU are part of the solution!!

@_date: 2017-04-18 15:22:25


No, I didn't assume that. Hence the first word of the second paragraph in my OP being "If"(The 6th word of the same paragraph is also, "If", btw. I reiterated "If" there, though it really didn't need to be reiterated, in an effort to be perfectly clear.)
Here's an explanation, although I am already regretting explaining the obvious to you, because I can tell that this very conflict is exactly what you are trying to get out of this conversation..oy
The reason I do not assume it's true is that, based on the many times I *have googled this*, I am, as far as I can tell ****with my current level of understanding****, being presented with ****Seemingly**** contradictory answers....hence my going to reddit to try to get a little more clarity on this. ..I know and admit without any reluctance that I seem to be misunderstanding something.
If you have a greater understanding of it, it's quite illuminating that you'd approach the discussion the way you are currently approaching it.
put another way, I have googled the fuck out of it, and it has not helped. (I openly admit that, although that is abundantly obvious from the very fact that I am asking the question, and putting "If" in the beginning of the second paragraph...although you are either trolling, or in such a hurry to tell me how wrong I am that you missed it)
You are clearly more interested in trying to make me wrong than you are in clarifying anything. 
I appreciate the fact that the next time I encounter someone who is coming from the same place you are (i.e., non productive, judgmental, looking  to belittle rather than trying to understand.) I will realize the absolute futility of trying to have a dialog with them a little bit sooner, and abandon the dialog with that person. 
I hope that's clear to you, there, buttercup...

I worked in marketing for almost 10 years, and I can tell you it's significant, even if it was accidental on Geico's part. 
Having the ability to pull the ads would absolutely be part of Geicos deal with Vice (embedded ad or not). 
If (and only if) Geico does not pull the ads, it indicates at the very least a small step in the direction of mainstreaming of Bitcoin. At most, it indicates that someone, somewhere in the gigantic corporation of Geico is pro Bitcoin, and that is a bigger step in the direction of mainstreaming. of Bitcoin.

Thanks for posting, you got me thinking.
I agree with your post, except for the quoted part above.
A Dr is one of the worst people to go to. I have direct and very personal experience with this. ..they provide the illusion of protection and illusion of cures for dis-ease. Look at western disease rates....ask your Dr how much schooling they took on nutrition...it averages out to 8 course hours across all medical schooling...8 course hours over the course of 12 years of college...compared to how much they learn about pharmaceuticals.
(The effectiveness of pharmaceuticals is testes, and reported to us by the very entities that make money by selling them. A clear conflict of interest)
Drs are trained in schools that are funded by the entititees who get their power from the status quo. That means, a patient cured is a customer lost. 
It is the Rare Dr who breaks out of this cycle of ignorance, and therefore,  they don't even look for root causes.  The "normal" way of doing it is to keep piling on invasive and expensive 
"treatments" that only address symptoms, until the patient dies, or runs out of money. 
Your post got me thinking. OpSec, it seems to me, is a a similar thing. We need to take responsibility for it ourselves, to the greatest degree that we practically can. 
I was initially overwhelmed by the thought of responsibility for my own health, but the alternative was to follow the advice of a Dr who is, at the very least, unable to think outside of a little tiny box. That was and remains unacceptable, so I started my continuing education about my own body. 
I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by the OpSec thing, currently.....but I have no real choice. I choose to take responsibility for my own security. 
Thank you again for your post. It got that particular ball rolling again for me.

I have come to the conclusion that at least some of the 2X crew are not themselves shady gangsters, per se, but rather have been threatened or otherwise forced to behave as such.
I began to wonder about this very early in the block size debate, because it seemed so illogical to be a proponent of bigger blocks, given the facts. 
Then I asked myself, **"If I were a very powerful entity who had no problems using violence for to continue to make money, and wanted to control public opinion as much as possible, who would I target?"**
In that scenario, "Bitcoin Jesus"  would be top of my list. 
No doubt.
The wondering gained momentum when I saw a Ver interview where he was shilling for bigger blocks, and was *clearly* reading his words from off camera.
I finally accepted this conclusion when I heard him say in an interview recently, "I like Bitcoin Cash because it is the most useful." 
IMO, he would literally have to have a severely broken sense of logic somehow shielded from the facts in some way to think that a crypto that is **only** useful as a speculative instrument is more useful than BTC. I don't think he is that stupid.
Ver was one of the first through the door leading to the brave new world of decentralization, and I think he took a bullet for all of us.

It's almost never perfect when they first start delivering it. Even the greats, like the guys in Talking Funny, refine their material in front of audiences. By the time you see a comedy special, the hour has been refined on the road.
Just like Bitcoin, they start out with an idea, and refine it as exposure to the real world dictates. They get better by "failing"
They get better at the initial writing part over time, but there are few who can do that, and some comedians say even the greats would do better with more working the material on the road.

I'm glad you are of the mindset of it being metaphorical. Any phys violence is used by the "elites" as an excuse for "retaliatory" violence. They often go so far as to get scumbags to go in and act as agent provocateurs (Like they do at protests). We are far more effective as a colony of entities working for good, as opposed to against evil. Just by learning using and spreading the gospel of Bitcoin, we continually erode their power base. One day it will topple, and I personally look forward to pissing on the central bank buildings in a celebratory drunken state when it does....and I am NOT being metaphorical. It will be a whirlwind tour.




IMO, you are wasting your energy if you go that route. You'd definitely be putting yourself in jeopardy.  The bankers, et al, are digging their own graves. Lets instead focus our energies on building the structures that by their very existence are eroding their base of power more and more.


You appear to have assumed that. Trust me, it is not. I'm thinking much bigger picture than killing a few bugs in the swarm thats been eating our crops for millennia.I'm suggesting working towards making the crops so strong, the bugs never get a toehold, and eventually, the swarm is gone. 




Ok, that's bad. The sexual satisfaction part. It *will* morph over time, continually making more and more justifications for doing things to people that you would never want done to you. Look in history how many truly good movements to stop tyranny ended up becoming the tyrannical force themselves, once they got in power. Getting intense pleasure from hurting others as an MO, no matter how justified you feel it may be, is an incredibly slippery slope. Over time, it never ends well for the perpetrator. It's just a matter of time before *they* are the cop beating up on someone and justifying it, or the politician who orders the killing of thousands of people because "they are terrorists" . 
The need for that satisfaction from violence eventually disables the persons moral compass.


I wouldn't say I am trying to stop you..I would phrase it as, "trying to get you to redirect your considerable passion in more productive and sustainable directions. "
The parent who beats a child because the child hit another child is just as wrong as the child for hitting someone.
 Be the change.  *Be the fuckin' change!*


***Violence works, but only as long as the threat of violence is still present, and likely to be used. It is not sustainable long term***  Once *the bully* who will beat you for swearing turns their back, we turn to the person next to us and say, "What a fucking douchebag that guy is. Fuck him. Fuck his mother, and the horse they rode in on."  (I know you can relate....I believe our backgrounds are likely very similar)


I don't agree at all. focusing on victimizing people only perpetuates victimization.  Not to say I wouldn't expose some types of behaviors...to use your example, if I found out a bankster was molesting kids and had proof, I would certainly take action to expose/prevent future molestation, etc. But at least as much of my energy, more, actually, would go into trying to find out *why our society seems to produce so many pedophiles*, **and working to remove the cause**.
Fix the problem, not the symptom, then you can move on with your life. 
There was a thing I heard that relates to this:
An old bull and a young bull were standing at the top of a hill, looking into a valley full of beautiful cows. 
The young bull turned to the old bull and said, "Let's run down this hill and fuck one of those cows!"
The old bull, continuing to chew his cud, turned to the young bull and said, "Let's *walk* down that hill and fuck **all** those cows."
So, I propose to you, young bull, that you up your game, and lets go fuck some cows. (as it were)

well, it depends on (amoung other things)
*the person who I am to teach
*history with that person (with some people, it most certainly cannot be reasonably expected to get easier over time, and refusing to accept that will literally drain the life out of you)
*circumstances in my life at that moment, and what services I am to provide. 
As an example, you ending the above interaction with "good luck"  carries with it a subcommunication that you are kinda done with the convo...which also implies that you have decided it is not in your best interest to keep going with the convo. 
I hope you can see what I mean.  Crypto at this juncture, in particular, requires a high degree of motivation to learn .  I assert to you that you should not allow others to parasitize your energy trying to teach them things they themselves will not put in the (considerable) work to learn.

The only times I have ever heard him mention BTC price, he has said it is one of the least important aspects. I have never heard him say it will moon. 
Can you point to any examples of him being significantly biased, particularly of him expressing bias and pretending he is not? I have yet to find a single one.
no downvotes from me, btw
Edit: (added for clarity) He has opinions, but in my experience he always says, "my opinion is.." or similar. I don't know if, according to dictionary definitions, opinions=bias, but for me, as long as opinions are clearly delineated as such in education, and are not added in too much, I'm cool with 'em

I think it could be epicly good. If Rogan prepared himself witht he facts about the stuff ver literally always uses for arguments for bcash, he could mop the floor with ver.
One of the biggest pluses about Rogan is that he is not afraid to contradict people sometimes.
I would however, be concerned that Rogan might be threatened into going along with vers bullshit. There is enough evidence that Rogan has altered his stance and/or what he is willing to discuss based on what would logically be things he might get threatened over. It could happen, and make no mistake, we are in the middle of a war right now with a multi trillion dollar industry. They have and will stop at nothing to preserve the status quo.
Learning to recognize their tactics is a powerful tool for us.

I want to, for sure. 
That's my point exactly....I aint saying don't fight, I am saying fight with the strongest weapon you got....tell people there are scams, tell them what to aim FOR,  cuz that is just 3 letters they gotta know. 
Don't ignore. Clarify for others to always look for "BTC" actually say "Bitcoin is BTC, no other letters, always look besure you are dealing with BTC when transacting". If the person you are talking to has any chance of being fooled. DONT EVEN MENTION bcash in any way, and you are doing a lot more damage to them.
  
Mentioning that "other coins have close letters, and some even try to fool you, so always check that it's BTC" WITHOUT even saying what those letters are is the worst possible thing for bcash.  It addresses the problems bcash is trying to create, and does not play right into their intentional game of using the anger we have to make it look like there is actually still a dialog going on as to which is the real bitcoin.
Did you ever hear the saying "Any publicity is good publicity"?  What that comes from is exactly this kind of situation. Marketers know that if they can't get you singing the praises of something, the next best thing is to get you to talk shit about it to everyone who will listen. Its literally how Howard Stern got famous, as one example, and he mentions it all the time, and says he is grateful to his haters.

They have already abandoned most of their sock puppetry, and the spam on Bitcoins blockchain attacks as well.  These are measurable  things I am talking about.
 The only real damage they can still inflict is diverting focus and tricking newbs.  The tricking newbs part is easy to address, without giving bcash any attention (It's called "paying attention" for a reason, paying attention to bcash is literally giving them power), by using my "Always check it is BTC, no other letters" approach. 
dont pay them any attention any more than you would a toddler who comes at you swinging fists. hold them away from you with one hand, and calmly focus your attention on something productive while they take their little tantrum

Enough with the bcash memes already!  These memes are the biggest thing keeling bcash in the dialog at all at this point. The battle has been over for a long time. Move on.
 You are giving them your attention. As long as you continue to engage in the bashing, it gives them the appearance of being more viable than they are. 
If you want to help newbs, be sure to say something like "make sure you are dealing with BTC, not any other letters", and you have helped, and can move on with your life and focus on something productive.

I am to trying to imply that there is no possible pleasure to be had via disney products, but rather that there is a n incredible amount of damage from their overall force on the planet, and that generally, the products they offer are analogous to junk food.  It might taste good going down, but they are unhealthy to consume. 
That is an overly broad statement in some ways, but there is a lot of truth to it.
As one example, look at the relationship model they have successfully sold to millions of kids.  "...and they lived happily ever after" being one facet of their unrealistic model  that is sold to children as being the ideal.
The whole Cinderella paradigm of the lowly slave needing to be rescued by a hierarchical ruler father figure...which sends horrendous messages to both boys and girls with girls needing to be rescued from their lives of misery and boys needing to be a prince to get a girl...I have yet to find an animated disney movie that does not have a supposed positive message as a veneer, and then the real one, which is awful underneath. The way narrative works, its the deeper message that gets through on the subconscious level. The subconscious is far more powerful, so that is what drives people most of the time.
Plenty of good reading on this subject is available, if you are interested. Google "Bad lessons from disney movies" for some.
That's just the movies, but most of the branches of the disney tree have some pretty dark shadows. How the employees are trreated at the theme parks comes to mind.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:27:18
don't ignore, be sure to always be specific about BTC when you are talking about Bitcoin. make "always check to make sure you are dealing in BTC, and not any other letters" part of your instructions to anyone who might fall for the bait n switch.
that is the one thing the bcash camp does not want you to do, because it takes their power away in that dialog without even implying that there is any real kind of comparison...without effectively advertising for bcash by mentioning their name.
Impostors of anything would of course prefer to be taken as the real thing, but once they know that ship has sailed, they will settle for just trying to keep the dialog going, because it gives them press.

Well, I dunno if that is def gonna happen or not, but if it does, there is an upside. 
If at some point there exists 2 viable versions of bitcoin, that just doubles the number of parties that would have to be co-opted, or manipulated, in order for a bad actor to extinguish Bitcoin. 
 I am kinda hoping a "FTW" situation arises from BTC alone, but, if the "federal" reserve and central banks were to have their asses handed to them by 2 versions (instead of 1) of Bitcion + all the Altcoins,  I would still see it as just as positive. , in many ways.

"well, theres Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash, they are not the same, and..." and then at the end of ALL that shit, you STILL gotta tell them to always check that you are dealing in BTC in order for them to protect themselves.

IF it splits for any reasonable length of time (BIG if), just HODL. 
I repeat...
Do nothing, as long as you got your coins on trezor or another wallet that supports BIP 148.
While you are HODLing, stay up to date on wtf is going on.
Remember: If an Alternate fork survives more than 2 weeks,  it will continue to live on, b\c the difficulty on that chain will be adjusted after 2 weeks, which would prevent any re-merging with the original chain (i.e., the alternate fork has set up camp for itself, never again to go back home) 
If that happens, You may want to sell any coins that exist on whatever chain you want to "Vote against". 
Selling the coins from the secondary chain allows you to "Vote" for the other chains validity, and also gives you a chance to recover some of the value that would invariably be lost from your total balance of both coins (Again, if the chains were to split). 
I can elaborate, if that's not clear, but no promises....I ain't Andreas.

yeah, pretty much. Re your point about it not doubling, I see where you are coming from, and you make a valid point. 
You are right, it wouldn't double them, but the total number of ppl wouldn't likely stay the same for long, either. I know if there were a split, I (for example) would not be likely to hodl both coins for long, b\c I would probably want to "vote" for one coin over the other, and  selling one to buy more of the other is an effective way to do that.

"rich" is a relative term. The ppl and entities who are threatened by illegal drugs make this guy look poor. Plus, the whole crypto thing puts him into a much more likely to be persecuted/prosecuted than if he were not threatening the illusion of legitimacy that fiat has by earning what is to us a lot of money in the form of crypto.

I still can't come to a conclusion if I believe that Roger has let his ego take him over, or if someone has been drugging him, or if he has had a gun jammed in his back this whole time, or something else. 
At the end of the day, it does not matter. He has proven himself to be someone not worth listening to. It's sad, because he was one of my early inspirations in the space. That is the way it is though. 
Best to not give him any attention. Its a waste of energy. It distracts the community from being able to focus on the issues that need attention.
Re Utility, etc...
Bitcoin does not have to be everything to everyone in order for it to change the world for the better. 
Other technologies can, and imo, will, be able to take over some functionalities that many atm want Bitcoin to retain and/or have. Having these technologies work with Bitcoin are a good direction to go.
It would be great if Bitcoin all by itself replaced the central banks, visa mastercard, etc, western union, etc, etc, etc. 
It may not be able to do all those things all by itself, and honestly, that's ok. 
Let's kill the biggest monsters first. They are the ones causing the most damage. The smaller monsters will fall eventually, if we get the big ones first. If we insist that we must kill them all in one fell swoop, we are almost certain to loose.

@_date: 2019-05-18 03:47:31
damn bro. My heart goes out to you.
Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:12:11
Hey no problem, man. Thats totally what I was going for, so it's good to hear it hit the mark
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:01:06
You are trolling. 
You get 0% of my mental hashrate.
That is my clarification.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:49:57


No. Not that at all.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:05:01
I should have said, "on one chain" and "about 2 weeks"...and my main point about the impossibility of re-merging still stands.
Re hashrate, we apparently have differing opinions on the reliability of the "commitment". 
You have a very interesting comment history soluvauxhall
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:34:08
you had me in a great headspace until you mentioned lions.
Edit: I just figured out that I was replying to a bot with this comment.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:45:37
Thanks. 
Yeah, that's what I was doing (Sending to Coinbase). 
Any idea why would/should they send it to another address after 1 confirmation? 
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:49:29

Just checked out his twitter feed. That guy is pretty friggin' cool.
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:41:49
please keep talking about this kinda thing if you could. here and on youtube. I'm in need of inspiration something fucking fierce atm. I'm sure I'm not alone.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:22:57
Never is a long time, exactly how do you define "Freedom" in your above statement? 
That would be required for one to decide if your points are valid or not.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:28:11
your didactic delivery aside, I appreciate the heads up.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:47:26

Is there a way to verify the non custodial aspects of this platform? Is it open source? 
At my current level of understanding, I don't see how it would be possible to tie any non blockchain assets like stocks to a non custodial wallet without introducing counterparty risk.
Doesn't the fact that Abra manages trades make this a custodial service?

The miners are following their best financial interests, and will mine the most profitable coin. The less profitable coin will either shrink into relative obscurity, or disappear entirely. 
^I watched a video today where the dude outlines his reasoning for this belief, and some other UASF stuff today. If you are interested, Lemmie know, I will dig it up and link you. (If not, it's all good!)
wrt dirty tactics, I disagree that the UASF movement is bullying or dirty in this regard.  They are customers of those exchanges telling the businesses that they patronize that they are not currently happy with the product they are paying for. 
Customer satisfaction, or lack thereof, is one of the fundamental forces that motivate markets....Though markets that have been rigged by the threat of State sponsored force (or some other hostage taking type behaviors) do not feel the influence of customer dissatisfaction nearly as much. Those markets tend to collapse or learn to listen very closely to the teeming masses very quickly, if free choice is restored to them.
I also disagree, as you would guess from the above, I'm sure,  that UASF will "sink" Bitcoin. 
If you're not already running a node, and you want to have more of a "vote" in the UASF, you could run a node and not signal for UASF, if you'd like. That is another avenue of expression available to you in this.

I'm with you. His Bruce Campbell Avatar adds to it significantly for me.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:29:06
That seems like an efficient thing to do. Thanks for replying.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:20:25
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:48:23
Im on it (The looking into part, that is). Thanks!

I don't like painting an entire gender with a broad brush, so  I am anti anti (insert gender here).
Perhaps the use of the tired ass trope of "revenge on the man who did (them wrong)" in a movie that ended up sending (at least you) the message it did is evidence that the culture at large is breaking away from the whole destructive "war of the sexes" mentality.
I am hoping so, anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:15:38
Ah, I see. I am in a different place wrt index funds than you (I am looking into this now b\c I have decided to get my retirement account out of index funds). My long term belief about Bitcoin, too it would seem.
I am also operating on the belief that there is an unprecedented worldwide economic storm coming, and that factors into my thinking, too. 
Thanks for replying, though. I appreciate you taking the time to do so. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:48:29

They (whoever "they" are, I dunno) say any publicity is good publicity. Not the best, but whatever.
In any case, it's *yet another* "female revenge on the man who wronged them" movie, and it's also got Anne Hathaway in it. 
I don't think that that the best of *anything* is likely to be found within.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:47:42
Noting everyones stance on this, still unsure which way I am gonna go, atm, but thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:27:16
Thanks. I did yesterday, still no reply.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:46:42
Cool, thanks for replying Paco!

Hey, thanks for your efforts to contribute. 
Im not seeing search, either.
Edited, issue w link resolved

The next step up in safety is a hardware wallet. Trezor, Ledger Nano S are the two I have experience with, and both are good, imo. Just be SURE to follow the instructions about writing down your seed. 
With a hardware wallet, having an equipment failure or loosing the device itself does not mean losing your coins (EDIT: AS LONG AS YOU WRITE DOWN AND KEEP YOUR SEED). 
Unfortunately, though, I get the impression that the best HW Wallets are all sold out (but I would check), and even if you ordered one now, it may not get to you in time for Aug 1, so that leaves paper wallets.
Paper wallets are really safe when properly done, but require a steeper learning curve than phone/desktop wallets, or hardware wallets.
