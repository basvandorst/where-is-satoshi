I completely agree. This is foolish in my opinion.

Not telling you how to spend your money by any means brother, and I respect that you have stuff going on. However, a mindset like that can seriously hinder your investment potential. There’s no better time then right now and it’s not too late.

Pretty much what this gentleman said. The way I see it, bitcoin is a commodity that has only seen &lt;1% adoption by the mass populace. Crypto currency in general is the future; whether that’s Bitcoin, Ethereum or the next big coin. 
We will all be getting our pay cheques in internet currency at some point. Maybe not next year, but in 10-15 years this technology will change the course of history. An investment now is a gamble, yes, but if you do your research into this tech you see the potential. We’re all risking a lot to try to better our future but I have confidence in it based on my independent research and the research from respected advisors. Obviously there’s a little bit of hope and luck involved (much like fiat currency also). 
Like others have said, ensure you only invest what you can afford to lose. That being said, at this point in the game we’ve all lost the opportunity to become multimillionaires simply from a $60 dollar investment. However, bigger returns means bigger capital required upfront. 
Do yourself a favor and research, research, research and diversify. It may be the key to unlocking a life for you and your family that may not have been imaginable prior to this technology.
