So is that different than Bitcoin Cash?   I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:22:33
No way.  You gonna tell us if you find anything?

I'm reading that Bitcoin Core doesn't like 2X, but 92% of miners signal 2x :( this seems terrible

So Antpool is a Jihan &amp; Roger Ver outfit -- and this was not previously known... They are spoofing support for BCH

Making money requires two decisions... 1) when to buy 2) when to sell....
Don't panic, just wait till it hits $5000 then HODL

Governments shut down exchanges making it difficult to transact.  DoS attack.  Nuclear war.  Bad actors infiltrate dev team in order to fragment the core and destroy trust.  Breaking the crypto it's based on.

When I plugged mine in for the first time, it updated the firmware, so I think that covers the hacking case.

I don't know the future, but I think its a good time to invest because there's 'blood in the streets', with the whole BC*H vs Bitcoin thing... and also uncertainty around 1X vs 2X.  If it looked like a super safe investment with nothing to worry about then you wouldn't have any upside.... because people are nervous the price is depressed.

It's high risk, high reward.  Maybe put 20% in... and buy in increments from that point forward... so if a deal comes along you can load up, and if it goes up well you missed out but you are trying to minimize your downside risk.   That's one way to play.

Each transaction moves some bitcoin...  BCH has fewer transactions but each transaction is moving more than 10X BCH so the volume is bigger but the transactions 10X fewer.  People think it represents artificial demand.

Some crafty Americans go to college in Europe where it's free.  As far as your paper wallets are concerned,  maybe put them in a safety deposit box or something... 6 - 8 years is a long time to hold on to a paper with some random words on it.  How do people plan on storing paper for a decade?

Clueless organization indicate that there is still potential for upside.

I'm happy with my trezor

How do you know how many people are shorting?  Sorry for the dumb question.

What about the upcoming Segwit 1X... is there a fork risk involved ??

According to user Canpan
Long answer: Yes, the outgoing transaction from a ledger to another one is done using crypto that can be broken by quantum computers. But a ledger that has never been used to send money is only visible by it's hash value. So it's security is based on sha256 which is quantum secure (There is Grover's algorithm, but it should be OK for a while). BC would just need to change the signing algorithm. So unless quantum computers pop up just over night everything should be fine.

It's a simple application of supply and demand.  The fewer coins, the more valuable the remaining coins are.

On hacker news, user "RandomInteger" says in a comment related to 'volume spoofing'
"Looking up the number of transactions on BCH, it seems like the volume per transaction must be much higher to get this overall volume, because the number of transactions is an order of magnitude smaller than bitcoin (~10%) [1]"

What should i use instead of MultiBit
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:34:22
Use a hardware wallet and don't panic

I put mine in a trezor and the wallet words in a book I like.  If I lose the trezor I can regenerate the wallet with the wallet words.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:35:53
Which alt-coin are you referring to please?
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:22:05
I bought from Coinbase.   I'm allowed to buy 1K per week.  Once I buy it, I transfer it into my trezor wallet.  Trezor wallet is backed up with wallet words and kept offline.  Wallet words are written in a book that I like and won't throw away.   
It might not be safe to buy coins around Aug 1.  
I have no idea what bitcoin will be worth in 5 years, since I'm predicting a world war with three combatants { russia, china, &amp; the west }

He would have got 10x that if he included his bitcoin address in the photo.

Not until the uncertainty around Aug 1 resolves.

He's referring to Ethereum

So since its not forked yet, there's no such thing yet as a forked bitcoin wallet yet... so there's nothing a person can do pro-actively. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:41:28
I've had a good experience with coinbase.  I have a $1K per week limit.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:53:26
My coins are in the latest version of MultiBit, I moved them from classic a while ago.  Is this a problem?

Why do people pay $10m for a (useless) Andy Warhol painting?  They aren't getting $10m of visual enjoyment out of it... The answer is they have confidence that at some point in the future they can sell it to someone else for $10m.  
Bitcoin also has the interesting property of being deflationary (fewer coins over time after the 21 m because ppl lose their wallets), immune from confiscation, transferable over the Internet.  Its risky, and might go to zero, but I still have a little bit and want some more.

Banks create money through fractional reserve banking.  Imagine a bank with 1 client with a deposit of 1,000,000.  Client  wants a loan... bank loans 90% of that 1m.  Now 1.9 m in circulation.  The Bank didn't call client  and say, "hey we loaned out 90%" of your money so you can't use it.

It's not a scam, its an experiment.  Nobody knows the future, might go way up, might go way down.

Thanks for sharing what are you doing about Aug 1?
