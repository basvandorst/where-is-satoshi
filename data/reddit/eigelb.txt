But it is quite expensive to join the Lightning Network. Maybe I have to pay 100s of $ to join it.
Because I have to use the Bitcoin Blockchain to join the Lightning Network.

No, litecoin will face same scaling problems.

What about this?
Segwit is a requirement for LN. Preventing LN is the only hope that shitcoins have for survival and the only way that miners can guarantee more centralization and higher profits by keeping everything on chain.

That is why I assked how Lightning will scale Bitcoin.

Can you please correct or complete my "new understanding" above?

That is why it is important to connect myself with a big node?
big = at least as much funds in the node as I want to send and a network behind that is as big as possible?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:45
That is interesting. So a good node would be connected with many other good nodes to give its users the best network effect?

thx any cons?

But most people will not open a payment channel if it costs 100s of $ to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:59:10
But how is that solvinng the scaling issue than? It is not suitable for small transactions that way.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:06:37
More pressure like this to make them adopt Segwit.
Boycott them in case you can (e.g. a competitor supports Segwit.)
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:13:08
Will nodes get paid for doing this? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:38:08
what are the cons of Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:40:44
I am talking about new developers, that do not own much Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:34
What are the cons of Segwit?

THX! Can you please correct or complete my "new understanding" above?

So I would sell e.g. litcoin to the node owner? To get my missing 0.1 BTC?
@_date: 2014-11-08 15:02:48
I like the page....good work!
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:37:29
In this case it would make more sence for me to pay with my credit card. Because if I pay with Bitcoin they save the credit card fees and dont give it back to me.

I had to wait for 6conf and I know that other people had the same problem.
Maybe your blocks were found fast.
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:21:40
This is a Bitcoin documentation. 
Why is there no discount if I pay with bitcoin. 
Why do they wait for 6 conf. ? The transaction is to 99,99% valid if you can see it in the blockchain.
