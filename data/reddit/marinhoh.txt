Thanks for the comment.
Could you elaborate more on what is a fractional reserve money?
Also how would be a better way to evaluate the BTC value?

I made this small analysis based purely on speculation on my part. I have no experience on economy and just want to bring up a discussion on the subject and maybe some enlightenment from people with actual economic knowledge.
One of the first aspect brought up by people outside of the BTC community is that it has no value in itself. Even though we are aware that this kind of affirmation is flawed I tried to come up with something to analyse the BTC value.
The total amount of bitcoin mined to this day is 16.7 million ( and each BTC is worth $7,815 ( by mutipling those values we get to a market worth 130.5 billion USD.
The Gross World Product is 107.5 trillion USD (
Comparing the bitcoin gross value with the Gross World Product it represents 0.12% of the total.
With that number we can evaluate if it is overpriced depending on our perception of the actual fraction that BTC has of the GWP.

Most exchanges limit the value of withdraw/day. 
On the most popular one you can cash 10k/day and this can be increased by contacting them and making a requirement.
To cash out a large sum It takes a while if you want It to be cheap but It is totally doable.

That is a great question I hope someone in this sub can give a good answer.

You should define what percentage of your investments you feel confortable to put on BTC and maintain that percentage
