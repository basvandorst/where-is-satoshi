Can I restore a CoPay wallet to another client such as Bitcoin Core/Classic? If so, what clients can I do this with?

So like BTCE is the only exchange which is unlikely to be killed even though it's ran by unknown Russian people in an unknown country?

I have a question concerning CoPay; if BitPay goes bankrupt, will I be able to convert my CoPay wallet into my Bitcoin Core wallet and vice versa?

BCi can't even correctly display balances or block information, as demonstrated during the halving and where users have complained (myself, included) countless times where balances have been incorrectly displayed. Buyer beware. Run a full node or go home.

This is absolutely f*cking appalling. Shame on BFX for failing security practices.

What an apt name.

Got the email. Never used BFL however.

SWIM has never filed a tax return in both jurisdictions

She's pretty. If she accepts BTC, I'll pay for 12 hours of companionship when I'm in NYC next.

This isn't good for Bitcoin. This is like going into the kitchen and finding a cockroach nibbling the left over pizza.

If she accepts bitcoin then it's really like free companionship and sex, which is great for early miners without middle aged commitments.

Maybe some mod can deal with donation collections and hold them in a P2SH multisig address with me.

If you're real time balance is always under $50,000 per bank and you have a good relationship, FATCA won't be as harsh since a lot of banks do not report balances of $50k and below.

I read your post in Are you planning on letting them expire? My company can try and fence them on their GoDaddy Auction account and get more than your registration fee.

If someone learned about a way of life during tragedy, then they're more likely to stay in the community forever, like my boss for example.
This can help people just like religion can.

Try Coinfloor's OTC service. My boss swears by their great service.

Milly is correct. You can use an offshore LLC with an Administrator who files W8-EXP as a passive NFEE without regard to any US beneficial owners.

It's shameful that the community are responding to this project like this. It's incredibly interesting and a great way for Bitcoiners to get involved with steg. Hope this project gets further developed.
