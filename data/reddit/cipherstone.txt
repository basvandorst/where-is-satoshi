Yeah but chances are you early day golden boys have hundreds if not thousands of bitcoins and life is heavy. 
Hell I’ll be lucky if I can ever make it to Just 1 bitcoin. But I ain’t mad. I’m a part of something now even if I am the shrimpers hodlr of them all. I can still be proud of my fractional amount. 
Plus I can pretend my 1k+ Dogecoin will rise to bitcoin levels in 20 years.

Just went off the buy price from Coinbase at the time. Seems off. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:54:47
No it seems odd for sure. I bet Coinbase added it’s purchase fees in. I was being lazy and Just went and did a buy for that amount. 
So I am even poorer than I thought. Thanks man :-)

Very real possibility.  Time will tell.

No need to split if you Store it in a bank physical safety deposit box. The chances of someone besides yourself getting access to it would be infinitely small. 
Plus if you were just going to HODL you could store the hardware wallet there too.

I'll admit, majority of my bitcoin was bought at 19k.  At the time we had just seen a large jump after CBOE options trading started, and we were on the cusp of CME options trading starting.  All indicators were that it would go up realistically to around $25k.  Should I have sold at 17.5k and eaten the loss.  Maybe.  While right now this really sucks, I think I'm going to ride it.  The money I invested came from the sale of some work stock which I was given, somehow it seems like less of a big deal since it wasn't money I had in savings, but it still isn't fun.  I refuse to sell and lose half the value, call me stubborn or a fool, maybe I am both. lol.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:13:44
Why don't you connect your bank account, takes weekly ACH buys up to 10k.  You just have to wait until your transaction clears but you get the BTC at the price when you bought.

Bought some of my bitcoin at 19.2k. That portion definitely feels like a gamble. This shit I bought at earlier prices feels nice. 
I’m HODLing at the moment because I don’t want to lose money if I were to sell. But damn, it’s gonna be hard to not sell if it gets back to 19.2k. 
Of course Ethereum is kicking ass too which doesn’t help.

Funny story. I had some Early bitcoin that I was going to spend on what would be me first ham radio equipment (I want to get into the hobby). Mind you this was a small but I bought back two years ago. 
But I also decided to invest a larger about pre CME futures launch at 19k. Well we all know what happened. 
Now I can’t spend that earlier amount because of the tank and have to hodl for both the old and new investment, so no spending for ham stuff. 
I take the licensing tests in two days. Lol. Denied. Lol.

At the time I hadn’t thought about bitcoin for some years, and hadn’t ever gotten any in any way. He was a work colleague wanted to get my interest and just show me a transaction. Fees were negligible back then.   
My only regret is that I didn’t pay him $20 to send me $20 bucks worth.

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:55:13
Look, it’s volatile. It goes up and down in huge sweeping changes. Unless you can weather that for the long term, you won’t be happy. Hell I have a buy I made at 19k when all the “experts” said it would soar to $25-50k.  Guess what, there are no experts. 
It’s at 12k now. Even if I wasn’t going to HODL, I have not other choice. You have to be prepared for that.

Thanks for this detailed reply. I’m pretty green on the back end pieces.  It just seemed like the way to get more full nodes online and presumable make the network better would be to offer some financial benefit to running a full node even if it was radically less than what miners get for obvious reasons.

A couple years ago I bought $15 on Coinbase and forgot about it. Came back. Jumped on the Ethereum bandwagon for a while and put it back in bitcoin when it was at $6.6k.  Not a lot of money mind you, but a solid 20X profit from when I first bought it. 
At around $16k I decided to throw my piss away birthday cash in thinking it would continue to go to 30-40k per bitcoin. 
But it appears I must hold on for the long run. It is what it is, you make decisions and live with them.  The best thing I could do is just forget about it again for a few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:08:44

orly? Been 6 months and my coin is down 61%. Let me guess, you bought when it was 10 cents.  I’ve found most people who make statements like this are not sitting on major bitcoin losses. 
But I do hope it bounces back for obvious reasons lol. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:40:34
Analog or digital, you give more example of passing fads which crypto could very well follow like the way of the Dodo for all we know. I hope I am wrong, I own crypto. But I’m not a zealot who can’t see the danger cryptos volatility faces. 
At least one doge still is worth one doge so we have that going.

Two words - beanie babies. Crypto is the digital equivalent of beanie babies. That’s the conclusion I have come to. 
And yeah, have some in plastic boxes in the basement. Value? Hahaha.  Suspect my crypto will give me the same chuckle eventually. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:41:49
Nah, understand I own crypto, at a 60% loss at the moment but I will continue to HODL.  I genuinely hope it succeeds, but the volatility needs to go away. Otherwise what is the incentive to buy a currency to spend that the next day is worth half or more of what you paid for it.  
I was responding to the poster above that something is better than nothing, not true. I mean there may be an intrinsic value, oh look I have X. But that doesn’t mean the value of X can’t drop to zero, or below zero based on what you paid for it. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:49:44
That’s always a risk and part of the challenge of crypto.. knowing when to sell.  Do I sell when it gets back to 20k or wait to see if it goes to 100k.
The same question plagues people buying or selling with crypto.  E.g place sells me a lambo for 100k, tomorrow that same crypto is worth half the value etc. seller paid fiat for the lambo so now it’s in the red. 
The question I wonder is when will bitcoin reach its stable state. After the last coin is mined? When it does and we stop seeing these huge shifts I could see it’s use skyrocket. 
I’m no crypto expert so all of what I’ve said may be bunk, just my thoughts. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:44:09
I’m hopeful. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:14:36
Yeah I did a small amount, like make 0.3-0.5%, thankfully. So I hodl. Just hate seeing it at a loss. Good learning experience.

@_date: 2018-05-20 21:57:16
It’s easy to HODL when you are still at 200% profit. I have some bitcoin that’s at -49% profit right now. All I can do is HODL. It’s not the greatest feeling, but what other option is there lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:16:27
Yup I hear ya. I had a small amount I bought at 6k. When the pre-CBOE and post CBOE to the moon was happening I decided to buy some more.
This was before CME trading. It being the largest future exchange in the world, I think we all expected (hoped) it would keep going up and then settle around $25k. So buying some at 19k didn’t seem like a bad idea.  
What can you do :-)
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:18:46
This holds true for any stock as well. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:14:26
And if it just keeps going down does your accumulation phase just become your continued loss phase?
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:33:04
Seems legit to me. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:17:30
Sitting at -60% percent loss right now. I some some free stock I got from work (small percentage of total, I think 3%). I don’t need it, I didn’t cash out savings etc. I’m just going to let it ride. At this point it’s no worse than going to a casino. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:10:22
Bitcoin is beyond the starry eyes early adopter phase where it cost nothing. You want it to be globally adopted, but why would it be when there is zero stability. 
What vendor wants to sell you something for $100 in bitcoin if tomorrow that $100 in bitcoin is worth $50. That’s a losing venture. 
Or as a consumer, if I buy $10 of bitcoin today and can only by $5 worth of gum tomorrow where is my incentive?
Sure if it goes up it both sides benefit. My question is this: How can bitcoin insulate itself from value loss?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:47:19
Bought some at 19k. I’m pretty dumb. Love looking at my -60% plus value. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:03:58
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:57:26
It’s been almost a year. I forgot about it. It’s still down -71%  thoughts?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:58:00
At this point the only stable use of bitcoin is to buy it and then immediately spend it all at its current price.  
People like to moan about it not being an investment, blah blah.  But even if you just us it as currency what you buy today, last month, last year may only be a fraction of its value today. 
The price of goods you spend bitcoin isn’t going down.  So that $10 pizza I want to buy Today with bitcoin I can’t because my bitcoin today is down say in value -60% from when I bought it.  Am I going to buy one slice and lose 60% ? 
That doesn’t incentivize me to hold onto bitcoin or buy it long term and it would incentivize sellers even less to accept. 
At which point if I am forced to buy and spend immediately to not lose money, where is the value over fiat for legitimate purchases? I mean most of us are converting fiat into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:42:20
There’s nothing wrong with wanting to earn a buck. While it cheezes me to look at that 60%+ reduction in value, in my case I had been given some company stock, I sold a small portion to try out some bitcoin. While the loss stings, I’m sure it stings more for others. At this point I’ll just hold it for 2-10 years and see if it goes back up. 
I will sell it when it gets close to original purchase price. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:36:04
I can see your point. And honestly I’m ok sitting on my bitcoin for decades if I have to go get to a point where I have my money back. It’s just one of those things that when you look at/track and say, Didn’t expect it to take that big of a hit. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:31:31
Oh snap you are right, just looked.  I’m at -78%.  Fun times. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:22:24
This is the most ridiculous argument I have seen. It’s been possible to spend bitcoin at many online place for years. And people have.  And I have. What your talking about is having more places and easier ways to spend it which has nothing to do with its unstable value. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:15:43
Technically true but I lost buying power.  In the real world, where I am supposed to be using my bitcoin, I can buy 78% less.  Because that’s the dream right? That bitcoin be actually used as currency. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:44:21
Or from you know, 70%+ loss of value from ATH...
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:32:15
Not entirely true. When the CBOE launched there was a decent price spike.  I bought a few thousand dollars worth after that happened because the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures trading for bitcoin was set to launch a few weeks later. CME is the largest futures trading exchange in the world. 
Similar boosts in price were expected.  I can remember thinking when the price dropped to 17k that I should sell. But I decided to HODL and now every day I get to look at my folly. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:35:47
Hindsight is always 20/20. At this point there is zero incentive to sell. The only option is to wait and see.

This is a common reason. When Apple was I. The shitter a fat cat at my wife’s work came down and was urging all the designers to buy stock.

I’m thankful of one thing, that I didn’t inves more.  I’ll sit on this tiny percentage and look at my 75% loss in value on my tracker and never forget this folly.   It’s been a good learning experience.
