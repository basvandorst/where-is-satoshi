Thank you, Lauren Orsini is a woman of Bitcoin even if she is not on the chart. There were numerous (great) women not featured on here, like the description says, it only showcased a small fraction.

We are not issuing counterfeits.. All arbitration awards received are valid. Pending arbitrations will be issued by a new provider to be announced in the next 24 hours. Don't mind net-arb's email, we chose to no longer work with them.

Jam has been experiencing some pretty gnarly ddos attacks I believe. Typically when your TFA isn't syncing though, try not using it on your wifi network. For some reason, that has fucked my authentications in the past.

I just PM'd you.
I didn't deal with the arbitration award's legal terms specifically, so you'll have to ask the email provided. Happy to answer any other questions here.

yo, itsinfo - I used to work for BTCjam and I believe you're mistaken here.
1) They announced they were closing almost a year in advance. I wouldn't consider this *sudden*. See their blog post from last year: 
2) The law firm is not fake. I believe Dhami Law just does not have a website. Happy to get you in touch with them.
3) As for the discrepancies with AMOUNT LENT, AMOUNT PAID, and REMAINING BALANCE, BTCjam has two different loan types. One being a "linked loan" meaning that when the borrower makes the loan, the principal amount is "linked" to the **USD price of bitcoin at the time the borrower receives the loan amount** and will repay based on this USD denomination. I understand the origin of your confusion here since the UI is not clear regarding this. They have a better explanation here: 
I hope that clears some things up.
