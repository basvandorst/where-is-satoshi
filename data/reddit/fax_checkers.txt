Of bitcoin falling
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:13:53
21k by mid Feb by my estimates 
Others are more conservative and say not until summer
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:07:52
It's exactly as any log chart shows
10k is exactly where we should be this month
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:01:34
That didn't answer the question!  :p
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:16:37
!remind me 6 months
Who's naiive now?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:06:50
This ain't the 2018 crypto crash
No that happens after we go much much higher
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:27:53
There's a limit but verification is quick
They use phone and do for higher limits
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:46
Wouldn't they panic less though?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:58:59
Volatility means money
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:00:34
They could also want you to sell for the same reason
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:31:30
I'm predicting a major correction in the next three weeks to 20k, maybe even 26k by the end of feb
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:50
No inflation
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:38:08
Multi year?
It could trigger that
It could also do nothing
It could also be that the market doesn't actually care about that
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:31:49


Blind memes?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:09
Their profits are the profits of hodlers
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:36:18
I'm sorry
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:02:51
Let's compare in three years
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:58:25
About tree fiddy
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:05:35
I hear you
It sounds like this party ain't ever gonna end
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:09:55
It will be beyond 20k by the end of the year
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:13:17
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:05:25
Good.  Let them lose their money o us.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:04:55
Ya gonna have to wait
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:06:29
Don't be a fool
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:27:39
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:27:09
Great time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:04:35
It's too high for now, but too low for next week
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:29:58
Don't forget dollar mania
That crash is a slow train wreck
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:28:24
That's a suckers game
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:37:54
Which means inflation is even worse
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:51:13
Everyone who says deflation is bad is wrong.
Deflation isn't bad, volatility is. Deflation is thought of as bad because it happens after rampant speculation that results in no goods.  People need real goods eventually, and when inflation gets too far, things collapse, deflation happens.
Massive deflation is horrible, because few people get rich compared to everyone else.  However, everyone who says deflation is bad is secretly hoping for it, unless they don't own stocks.  Stock prices going up is deflation, although it isn't the money supply, well, didn't use to be tied so closely to it.

All actual resources are scarce, which prevents much economic development, usually through bombing them
Bitcoin is at least peaceful, for now.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:58:53
That's because straight lines on log charts over several years are not bubbles
