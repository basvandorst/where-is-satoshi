I think that a lot of exchanges can not afford the increase of that much clients, so they "paused" the verification. When they resume it, there will be a significant increase, might be at 20k again.

Ups, should be .com. My misstake. 
The fees are a bit lower than coinbase. 
I used it to buy dash. And then when i buy btc i make a few comparisions. 
There exist also, anycoindirect.eu and litecoin.eu. both from NL.

Actually why schould we transact using exchanges. It just came to my mind, btc and alts are peer to peer. So why we dont exchange from peer to peer....

Lol. Of course!!!!!
Apple, samsung etc... I don't buy products of them. My phone is a fairphone. I just don't like corporations that only look at profit. See scandals of foxcon, etc..
I'm not a custumer from a normal bank, cause 'normal' banks are just a scam, see the last crisis. My banc is a ethic bank i.e Triodos. 
I have one strong thought. Money is another instrument that is necesary in democracy. Whenever you spend money, your deciding how the wold goes. 
So Btc is a different instrument, better than Fiat. It is descentralized.

just save your criptos on your computer or hardwallet
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:57:07
where the hell did you find it. Gues that with Electrum you can import the wallet with the seeds (comission 0.1% for me) lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:04:22
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:41:05
Copy paste from the link: 
It sounds like you're using a bech32 address which starts with bc. Most exchanges don't support this format at the moment. Do you have funds in this wallet already? If this is a new wallet and has no balance in it it might be best to create a new BIP39 seed using a tool like this one (Generate 12 words) then import this into Electrum as a new wallet.
To do this click File in the top left of Electrum, choose New/Restore. Choose Standard wallet from the first list of options, then select I already have a seed. Type in your seed phrase from the online tool into the box and before continuing check the BIP39 box in Options and it should tell you that your checksum is okay. In the next screen it will ask you what wallet derivation you would like to use. Here you should replace the default text from 44 to 49 so that it is the following:
Following these steps will allow you to create a Segwit wallet in Electrum that uses the legacy address format (starting with a 3) and so will be compatible with all exchanges/wallets/etc while still being a Segwit wallet for lower fees. Unfortunately it's not a very user friendly process at the moment due to the lack of adoption of the new address format from businesses/exchanges/wallets but if you follow the steps you can benefit from lower fees while retaining backwards compatibility with everywhere that uses the old format. This will reduce your fees slightly as it is Segwit, but not as much as if you were using a bech32 address (starting with bc), so in the future when a majority of exchanges and wallets support sending to bech32 address formats it may be worth it to move back to your bech32 wallet or to a new bech32 wallet so you can benefit from even lower fees.
Hope this helped, let me know if you're confused.

Do you at the states have something like an ethical bank?

Its nice, and i thought that monday is a good day to buy as well. But, 
you're only analizing a limited time period. That's a limited sample for the BTC world. It would be nice to see a comparisin between September- november 17 (befor the ATH)
If it is looking promising, you should do comparision between years! :D
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:28:04
Check this thread. Had the same problem. You need a segwit begining with 3 not with b
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:01:38
Thats true, but only for the moment. If more people are looking for ' green companies' then the minig would be green as well. 
The point is, that we need to change. And i think that btc is one point more, but of course there are a lot more. 
And traditional bancs are not trustworthy. Benefits are privatized and losts are beeing public, paied with taxes. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:32:55
Its a long term stuff. It is speculating, but at least i'm spaculating for a new technology, for a different economic system. 
To not freak out, you can forget about your btcs, or you can try to buy some stuff. You need some positive reinforcements.

Ohh great! Thanks for your answer and info. And....
It worked! I ceated a segwit address and could import it to electrum, and Gdax transfer works!!! 
Nice!! It was quate simple!! Thanks again

ahhh i forgot. I bought more on monday. The price is the same....
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:52:50
Probably (in my opinion) its going down tomorow. But now its a good price too. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:28:40
I use it and i like it. However tx fees are not editable and segwit update wont come soon. 
So i will migrate to electrum, but probably will continue using exodus. 
And, save.... I read that they will incorporate 2fa autorisation. When it is done then it should be save, as the other ones.  For the moment, the email backup us quite unsafe, but for small amounts it should be fine.

The private key is your btc/information. For example if you make public the private key, then everybody have acces to your BTC.
When you import the private key to another wallet, then there you will have all your BTC. Using this new wallet (without minimums) you can do what you want.
Some electrum import tuturial will help you, i guess!

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:19:47
Could play a role, but i guess it only explains max. 5-10% of it.
There was a hack (20%)
Bcash - Coinbase (40%)
Fees (20%)
Futures (5%)
X% other
Actually, we could calculate it, if we take into accoount the mass of transactions. 
If there was high volume trans. it could be atributed to Bcach - Coinbase
Middle: Fees and dip..
Low ammounts to "Ludic" stuff
and so on...

is this log graph?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:31:44
Hi! Well actually they don't save anything in own servers.  At least that is what i understood. 
For example at their web you can read: The private keys to your blockchain assets are generated and encrypted locally and stored on your computer. 
These keys are never stored on the cloud, and they remain 100% for your eyes only, 100% .
My experience is good. You can export your private keys, and continue with other wallets like electrum. 
As well they are planning segwit transactions..... The only con is that when you need to recovery your wallet, they send you an E-mail and this could be cracked...

I did two transactions buying BTC with € and it was OK. Just like another exchange, but P2P :D
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:26:40
I thought that, since you use internet, and your wallet is from your computer,then it could be traced... And there are coins just about more privacy ....
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:53:57
Ip can be traced, but u can use a vpn or bisq via tor, so....ilegal mybe but....
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:17:55
It is nice to have some $ or € in a mobile wallet. Then in whatever situation you might buy a coffe in some place....Some days ago i just bought a small thing in Amazon via lightning...
Some days i get tiped from Reddit users or twitter... It's funny!!
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:23:16
Never had this problem. Check your Adress, could just be wrong. 
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:19:57
  
I use bitcoin lightning wallet [  
Send to your address (it is a segwit adress) btc, you will have to pay fees (1sat/byte, slow)  
Then open a channel (at least 0.003btc). The you can send to another lighning adress 8000 btc
But i'm not sure if it is easier to use normal btc transactions. Just send to a segwit address youre 8000sats.

2 Bisq to continue and to buy with real p2p
3 store in your own wallet.

I only have good experience with it! But it depends a bit on how much do you want to buy. Further, there is abuy/sell limit for new accounts.

I thought that when you sweap or restore with seed, you have the same BTC address. So both wallets get the info of blockhain. But not sure.   
I started with Exodus as well. Know i only use it for some Alts. I changed cause the fees, and learned about segwit addresses. And i use know electrum
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:36:31

Reason to buy more btc
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:43:12
I can't tell for sure, but the last weeks, saturday is the highest close during the week. Sundays was lower than saturday and monday starts with lower price when comparing it with saturdays. 
Off course, these differences are NOT significant (statistically). Yes i did some calcs. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:15:56
i bought at 6.8k XD. 
And on monday i will buy more, hopefully cheaper than today. I expect rise to 10k for today/tomorow and during weekend it will go down 8.5k - 9K. Monday cheap, thursday 11k. o_O

@_date: 2018-02-24 09:26:13
its now
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:42:36
yes. but there are alternatives. As soon zou buy, you schould transfer it to your wallet

I payed almost nothing in fees!! Yeaaa

If i send you 10 $ for a coffe, and you go to buy one it is easy (10 ). You just need an app. But, 
if you want to buy more, you need to register to an exchange. It was easy half year ago (almost instant) but now....
Then you need you own wallet and think about security, then it is more a 3-4.
