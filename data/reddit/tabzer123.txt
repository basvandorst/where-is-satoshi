This.  He has to stand behind the US Dollar, which the economy is represented by. It's kind of an impossible position.

Roger Ver MO:
"I am not trying to make people think BCH is Bitcoin."
2 minutes later.  
"BCH is the true Bitcoin."   Middle finger.

Hodl stands for "hold on for dear life" or "hold on for deer life"
It is now engrained in Bitcoin culture and is not going away...sorry.

I'm sorry.  I look at this topic and I see satire.

Are you going by the logic "I could sell you this orange for $10, but I am going to sell it for $5, therefore I am losing $5 of profit"?

If Ver knows anything, it's how to be a sneaky con artist.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:43:33
How are you making that point?  If the batteries cost $100 to make, and he sells the 75 version for $200 and the 60 version for $150, he is still making a profit on both.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:35:25
It's marketing.  Your previous comment makes it sound like it's a kind of charity.  It is not.  On top of that, the people who pay for the unlocked version of the battery is suffering the greatest share of the burden.

What? Make money?  Or refuse to make even more money?

I didn't imply that either.

It is a well written opinion piece that reveals the bad side of Ver.  People might try to say it isn't there, but it's because they want to be the same way if it means getting more money.

Is there a way for anyone to compile the binaries?  I was just following the context of 's comment.  It seems like it should be released or not released.  Releasing the release notes ahead of the actual release is the origin of this conflict.  I know it's difficult to do both notes and binary in tandem, but considering that it is done in the open, maybe the release notes can ride behind it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:19:33
I'm sorry, did you mistake what I said as a request for advice?  I'm not the one who is waiting.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:31:37
Then who is the release notes for and why release them days ahead?

Considering that Reddit is the backbone for this trend, it really can't get better.  If this discourse was on the blockchain... 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:10:27
It can be, sure.  No argument there.   But "consensus" is one word and "majority rules" is two words.  Consensus, in Bitcoin, has been determined by the majority hashrate and the protocol that hashrate reinforces.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:13:23
Until now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:52:09
What do you mean by miners?  The actual hashing power, or the people who have miners that often offer lip service?
I am in favor of what the miner consensus determines.  I will only accept a hardfork as bitcoin when the stem it branches from is dead.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:32:02

Nah, just "Down Under".

Except one fork was validated by the collective consensus, and the other bypassed the need for validation.  HF vs SF.  One is a bastard, and the other adhered to its parents' method of security.  I'll let you guess which one is which.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:52:13
I know what you said.  I also know that you mean to avoid admitting the very basic fact of my statement.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:05:16
That is not what I said or suggested at all.  What I am saying, is that I would only accept a hardfork of bitcoin, as bitcoin, if its main stem collapses.  This has nothing to do with valuation in terms of fiat or how other projects are innovating.
You can argue that BCH is better than BTC.  But you cannot sell BCH as BTC.  That is fraud.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:16:33
lol.  More salt.  
[Don't be a fucking dickhead. Stick to the argument and stop trying to feel superior](
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:39:11
So does being naive cause conartists to take advantage of people?
Let me reword what you said for you.
"if you didn't want to partake in consensus, for whatever reason, then you had no choice but to fork."
It's easier to understand.  Simplification is adhering to the greatest common denominator.  You could have rejected segwit though, but you weren't consensus enough.
I love salt.

Stops functioning in an objective sense.  Actual downtime.
But all in all, we only had that happen, maybe once?  And that was because there was a bug that erroneously generated a shitton of bitcoin and ruined bitcoin for everyone.  Do you think that old chain could be resurrected?  You have me thinking about that now.
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:55:56
Think the clickbait comment is in reference to the porn vid name.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:35:25
I am a little confused.  I meant to suggest that the dead fork is what is suffering from the downtime/collapse.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:28:09
Why couldn't it be possible?  
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:03:48
It's an ongoing conversation where I am pointing out that while one proposed solution Segwit, may have corporate interest in mind, the alternative option being spearheaded by a couple cons in an outright attempt to open bitcoin up to exploit.  I'm even outlining, to a degree, how.

Hello Onecoin
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:43:59
Maybe it is normal because it's worth the fees to the users who drive up the price.  You might actually be wrong about the price depending on "network effect".  People see the increasing scarcity and value and think it's better than gold.  It is, from an investment standpoint. 
I don't think mining is "super healthy" before or after this.  With FPGA's it was.  The ASIC and the ASICBOOST​ advent is a centralization mess.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:35:22
Satoshi left and you have to accept that.  However, this talking point is a good step forward in making Bitcoin more user friendly.

Miners are seeing their profits continually increasing as people pay more and more for fees.  Probably will be another miner boom followed by another jump in BTC price, followed by more people who didn't purchase enough BTC.  Jihans gonna sell tons of miners doing what he's doing.
