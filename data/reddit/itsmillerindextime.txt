I had that dilemma when I was deciding if I should try purse. I rationalized it to myself in the following way (for better or worse). Credit cards are and gift cards are inherently prone to fraud (especially buying gift cards with credit cards). Stores accept them because the pros outweigh the cons for them. I'm all about stores switching to payment methods that would eliminate the fraud vectors that purse likely allows for. I think if the majority of purse orders were fraud, they'd have been shut down by now. I do think it's likely the fraud rate is higher on purse than on Amazon directly. Where do I draw the line between using a payment method susceptible to fraud (like a credit card) and using a payment method that is mostly fraud (not that purse is mostly fraud, I'm not sure where they fall in that spectrum). I decided that as long as I didn't know for sure something was mostly fraud, I'd let the stores figure that out. If Amazon is being scammed, then they should move to something more secure than credit cards. If only there was a more secure payment technology out there...

By shopping at target with a credit card I know there is some risk that I am aiding a hacker. There is a non-zero probability my credit card number will be stolen from target, and used to make fraudulent purchases that will cost honest companies lost revenue. Do I refuse to use credit cards over the moral issue of this security flaw? My transaction with purse is bitcoin for amazon goods. While there is potential for fraud that may be higher than other payment methods, I have no proof it is higher than other methods, or higher than something amazon deems 'worth it' for the sale. I trust amazon will take care of this if it becomes an issue (better credit card fraud monitoring, 2fa for credit card purchases, changing the way wish lists work). If purse causes amazon to implement an industry leading change to make online purchases less fraudulent, fantastic. Edit: forgot a letter
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:28:22
While I'm sure there is some fraud going on, I thought I'd chime in and add a datapoint. $600+ saved off 64 transactions with no issues yet. While there were a few situations were people with 0 reviews bought an item and then never followed through with the purchase, I just relisted the item and asked purse to cancel the original transaction. Been posting in for three years so anyone willing to flip through my history should see it's clear I don't work for purse. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:42:39
I still use cash despite its use for fraud, I still use credit cards despite their use for fraud, I've used western union despite its even higher use for fraud. I don't know where purse falls on this spectrum of %fraudulent transactions, but I assume if it was 'mostly fraud' it would have been shut down by now. I'll let Amazon assess fraud rate of payment mechanisms. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 16:55:59
I agree it's a slippery slope, and everyone is going to draw the line at a different spot. Some might refuse to use western union all together as their legitimate use is keeping western union in business and allowing them to profit off of fraudulent uses. Anywhere you decide to draw the line is going to be subject to bias and debate. My argument for drawing the line before your example, is in that case, you know for sure your profit is coming 100% from fraud. With purse, I'm told there are legitimate reasons for people to buy bitcoin on pure (i.e. mechanical Turk) and I don't have any proof that this isn't a real use case. I'm not sure what fraction of my benefit is due to fraud. As a result, I'll continue to use the service until I know otherwise. Full well knowing I'm contributing to a system that allows for some fraud. Just like I am when I use credit cards. % fraud is what I would use to draw the line, and I don't have this information.

It just seemed strange that other bitcoin links open wallets and shape shift opens the App Store. Not a big enough issue to contact support over. I can copy and paste into a wallet. Was more curious if this is the case for everyone or if it's just me.

When I use the shapeshift iOS app and click "open in external wallet" it opens the AppStore for breadwallet. My preferred option would be for it to open up Copay like all other bitcoin links do, but even opening breadwallet would be fine (which I have installed). Why does it go to the AppStore listing for breadwallet? Does this happen for others? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 00:40:55
Yea, their marketing has always said 15% though and you used to be able to easily do better than 15% with a new account. Well, after the first transaction which they capped it at 20%. My suspicions are 15% might be pretty hard to come by with a new account these days. Hoping someone new to Purse sees this and chimes in to save me the experiment of creating a new account and buying something.

They sent me a link which had a field for e-mail address, then a button for credit card and a button for bitcoin. Credit card wanted card details and for you to choose a username and password.

Don't use them for things you can/don't mind doing your self. Use them for things that are going to be a pain, and you don't have the time for whatever reason.

You should pay dividends to the holders of the tokens. Not profits as that'd land you in a heap of legal trouble. Instead, send out something like 1 'backstage pass token' to every big deal token holder. Then make the description of 'backstage pass token' be "the first 5 people who send a backstage pass token to this address _______ will receive backstage passes." You could do the same with other freebies and giveaways. Free cd, first listen of a new song, etc. It will drive demand for owning your big deal tokens aside from them just being collectors items.

Definitely worth checking the service out if you haven't already.

I'm actually not sure how the fee structure works. This was the first time I used it. I asked for a $5 tip to be added to my $8.99 fee, but when the link came it was only for $8.99 and there was no tip field. In retrospect, I should have asked for a second payment link. However, this thread blew up, so I'll consider the free PR my tip. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:22:54
Wow, thats a long list. I mentioned above that it took me roughly a month to get through and I started with 23,000 people in front of me. Maybe they're scaling up faster these days? On the bright side, its a one time wait list. Maybe by the time you have a need for it you'll be through the list.

Are we assuming your encrypted wallet is stored offline? If thats the case, yea, the chance of someone breaking into your home, stealing your flash drive with the encrypted wallet file and then also hacking into your e-mail and knowing which ‘randomly’ generated activation code you used for your password would be quite slim. How are you generating this encrypted wallet though? Was it ever online at some point?
Its a bit difficult to provide storage advice without knowing things like the amount you’re wanting to store, how often you want access to it, how rapidly you want to access it, etc. It sounds like you don’t want to have to memorize anything, and don’t want to have any password getting stolen. If you really want safe offline storage with no memorization, you could use SSSS to break the private keys into n pieces, and require m of them to reconstruct. Say for example, you break it into 4 pieces and require 3 of them to reconstruct the private key. Keep one at your house, one at work, one in your car, and one at a friend/relative’s house. If one is ever compromised or destroyed, you use the other three to move the funds to a new address. You could do 3 of 5 if you want to be able to lose two of the pieces. 
Alternatively, more and more multi signature wallet services are popping up like  and  that come with a whole slew of security features which would put the chance of losing your coin below having your password in your e-mail somewhere. There are also devices like  which make offline storage very user friendly (literally the click of a button). With piper you could print offline private keys, BIP38 encrypted private keys (encrypted with your activation code if you wish). Piper can also split keys into m of n pieces with SSSS as mentioned above. Lastly, piper comes pre-loaded with electrum, so you can have an offline wallet with multiple addresses, and even use a USB stick to sign transactions and then plug the USB stuck into an online computer to push the transactions out to the world without any risk of your private keys getting out. I could go on and on listing different wallets/services/methods of cold storage, and there are more on the horizon. It really depends on where you want to lie from convenience to security.

Can't wait for this. Will it allow a hardware wallet for each seed? My ultimate goal for cold storage is to require access to multiple physical locations, and at each one, recover the Trezor from a different seed to sign a piece of the multisig transaction.

Odd. If you try from a different browser, does it let you in? Or do you get the same full message? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:20:57
I don't know. You still see the amount you're about to send before you send it, and it's not hard to check a few characters of the address to make sure the scanner didn't change it on you. I wouldn't be too worried about a highly reviewed QR scanner that's been around for a while doing that.

Agreed. However, if three of my five locations burn down before I can move my coins, I'm having a bad day. I give that a lower probability than one of the banks being destroyed somehow. After one house fire, I have four pieces left and only need three of them. I take three and send the coins to a new 5 piece multisig.     


$70 per year for both isn't terrible. However, then I need to get to two banks to spend if I needed to. What if it is a weekend of after hours? Going back to above, I'd be more concerned that I would lose access to one of these two pieces (tornado, flood, losing legal access to the box for some reason, etc.) than I would be about losing access to 3 of my 5 locations. So now I'm paying $70 a year for less piece of mind and less convenience. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:21:58
I'll have to look at it further. Quickly glancing through the coinkite website on the go, it's not immediately clear to me if it's possible for a US merchant to instantly convert each sale to fiat, or what the fee for that would be.

Since you asked, is there any way to check the 2FA code after Trezor signs its portion of the transaction? I.e. have the hardware wallet sign first and GreenAddress sign second? If I initiate the transaction as soon as the 30 seconds starts, I get my transaction off just as the 30 seconds expires. Assuming I actually want to skim the address on Trezor's screen to make sure it is my intended destination, I have about a 50% success rate of getting the transaction off before the 30 seconds expires and I need to start again with a new 2FA code.      
Edit: for what its worth, it did seem like the Trezor was taking a bit longer with 1.3.0 to sign transactions than it had in the past. Or maybe it just seemed longer because I was racing a clock. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:32:22

If I can access my private key, I haven't found out how. The app is pretty minimal. There isn't even a transaction history, I have to use a second app for that to track my Pheeva public key. I'd think it would be pretty easy to spot a way to get at my private key.

This was suggested to them yesterday. Proposed solutions ranged from putting the QR code inside the vending machine (back far enough where it can't be covered by a sticker on the front glass), an e-ink display (still fairly cheap), or an audio method of broadcasting the QR code (i.e. similar to chirp).

Couldn't you also just truncate the 24 word seed to 128 characters and write the remainder on all of the pieces. The average length word on the BIP39 list is 5.4 letters, so the average 24 word seed (sans spaces) will barely be too long. Sure it will decrease security making the last few words public, but if all the pieces are in semi-trustworthy hands/places, it should still be very secure. 24 words is pretty overkill to begin with. 
Edit: or just do it twice. Once for the first 12 words and once for the second twelve words? Every location gets an A piece and a B piece?
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:20:08
I think the idea would be for any of the players to quickly pull out their app and quickly join in the creation of a multisig address. No laptop needed. Additionally I think the intent is for the app to be specifically poker geared. Probably something along the lines of the players voting to come to agreement as to who got 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and then they all sign the transaction with the payouts. Someone who knew little to nothing about bitcoin could still participate. i.e. they wouldn't be just signing a copay transaction, they'd be simply ok'ing the order of the top three finishers.

Whenever I play online poker I always just assume the worst. That 5 of the people at the table are college pals on the phone with each other and collectively have much more information about the hand than I do. I assume something like Veridu could cut down on that? Some metric regarding the likelihood multiple players know each other. On the flip side, if players weren't cheating, it would be fun to play at the same table with a friend across the world. This is the main thing for me that takes a lot of the fun out of online poker.

There is no 'beating you to it' in this case (based on my understanding thus far). The bounty goes to the person who hashed the evidence first.

Wouldn't that significantly drop the value of XCP? The only value comes from the need for XCP to register a token.

Agreed. If just one product that highlights an advantage of bitcoin (I.e does something that fiat can't) went viral, everyone would need bitcoin to use it.

Unfortunately some local businesses use static addresses pasted near the register. Using one app to convert my receipt total to bits, and then switching to breadwallet to send is enough to prevent it from being my main wallet. Admittedly that's probably a unique use case. Other than that I love everything about the wallet. Looking forward to the detailed transaction information.

Wow, mind is blown. I've mentioned to multiple people that this is why I don't use AirBitz and nobody has corrected me.

It's much easier in my opinion. If you had your compatible wallet open, you just wait for the merchant's POS app to broadcast the noise, and your app would ask you to confirm. No extra effort required on your part.

Thanks again. I assumed the answer to my original post's question was that B would send the 0.5 BTC to D immediately, but I was a bit murky on how this overlapped with transaction malleability risks.

In most situations QR codes scan pretty fast, but not always. Remember the days where lines were far more frequently held up by people digging for checkbooks and writing out checks, or counting up pocket change? I'd rather bitcoin not fall into the same category of annoying transactions to be waiting in line behind. If there was an easy way to speed up transactions in the presence of bright sunlight or fluorescent lighting glare, why not?

I have more confidence in a BIP38 private key I generate offline than one your company creates. However, if my BIP38 key was supported by your app, I'd gladly pay for that. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:28:21
To me it seems like that would be the best practice, but BitPay (and presumably Coinbase as well?) accept 0-confirmation 0-fee transactions as of now. Apparently its not a problem as I don't see any complaints of merchants losing revenue. However, I've yet to figure out why it's not a problem. I must be missing something.

Coinpocket was my most used wallet for a long time. The HTML5 version was the best wallet out there, and Mike was the first wallet in the app store as soon as Apple came around. Can't thank him enough. These days I tend to use the BIP32 options (greenaddress and breadwallet), however, coinpocket is a solid app that I still highly recommend. For anyone wanting to keep their spending and receiving to one address, this is the wallet to go with.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:08:15
Monthly or weekly seems like it would be good for parental controls (bitcoin allowances). I'd probably continue to use it as-is though. Another use that comes to mind is stores who accept bitcoin directly (no fiat conversion). They can use the receive tab to generate dollar specific QR codes. The owner of the store can set the send limits in a way that an employee could issue a small sized refund if need be, but would need the owner to issue a refund above that. 
Other bugs:
It seems there is no way to enter a decimal when typing in amounts for send or receive? It just pulls up the phone number pad.

I'm aware of this, but no brick and mortar business is going to choose anything more than 0 confirmations. You can't have people waiting "on average" 10 minutes at checkout. Double spend wouldn't be much of an issue for small purchases, provided a transaction fee was included.

'Snail paper' would make it much more difficult for stores to convert instantly to fiat. Also, the scanned address wouldn't contain information as to the payment amount. If the customer manually typed in a fiat amount, the BTC the store got would depend on where the customer's wallet was getting the exchange rate from. E-paper does seem to be a popular solution. Hopefully we'll see e-paper displays that easily interface with Coinbase, BitPay, etc. at some point in the future.

Apparently there is lots of redundancy built in. I've tried it in very loud places (public transit, noisy bar, etc.) and it always seems to work almost instantaneously. Way quicker than scanning a QR code. Nothing worse than demo'ing paying in bitcoin and having the QR code not scan right away.

Was it the iOS blockchain app? The iOS wallet has been known to randomly leave off the transaction fee. Otherwise, unless you used custom send and intentionally set it to 0 BTC it should have included a 0.0001 BTC fee automatically, which I wouldn't expect to go unconfirmed.

I know a traditional double spend would be very difficult and not worth it. But if I were to never include a fee whenever I paid with bitcoin through Coinbase or BitPay, would 100% of those really make it into the blockchain? I am going to test this out soon by sending payments to myself (via BitPay). For some reason it seems unrealistic that all of the 0-fee transactions will confirm. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:22:25
I kind of wish they made it more clear that the $0.18 fee was a flat rate ACH fee, and not a %. When someone types in a $1 just to see how the fee works out, it looks bad.

People are going to start thinking I work for changetip, but I never see anyone else mention this. Changetip (as of recently) will let you buy up to $50 in bitcoin instantly. Great for someone new who might not want to set up a circle account or a coinbase account.     
Since I see you have an iPhone, I'd recommend you use breadwallet to store the bitcoin you purchase from changetip (or circle/coinbase/etc). If you end up buying more bitcoin as a long term (and admittedly risky) investment, I'd store that offline in a multisig address.     
Edit: clarified I was recommending breadwallet for storing/spending and not as a means for purchasing.

@_date: 2014-07-14 06:48:32
It'll sweep. This is a deterministic wallet, which means it is keeping track of an essentially unlimited number of bitcoin addresses or you. If you come across a deterministic wallet letting you "import" private keys instead of "sweeping" them, be very careful with your backups.

Even if it is logging private keys, as long as it never touches the internet again, it wouldn't matter. I can't think of a way I could get burned here, but, before I store too much in private keys generated with this electrum copy, I figure it's a good idea to make sure I'm not missing anything.

I suggested to Tony Gallippi at a conference a while back that BiyPay should consider this.

I'm often out to eat with multiple people new to bitcoin who have just setup wallets. Letting everyone chip in to pay would be very helpful.

Killing the app and opening again helped with almost all of the above issues (sans the BIP38 obviously, great news that it is in the works!). However, now that the above are fixed, it turns out I do have expired outputs. Unfortunately I can't get the "Redeposit as one transaction per output (better privacy)" button to work. It asks for my 2FA code, and then nothing happens. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:44:37
Agreed. Waiting for the day one of the implementations has apps for both iOS and Android which allow for spending of zero-confirmation assets. I often think of in-the-moment uses which would really only be possible if those present could pull out their phones and participate on the spot (without waiting maybe 40 minutes for a confirmation, as always seems to happen when trying to demo something). 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:44:53
True. I guess for me this would only be used for small purchases on the go, so it wouldn't be a huge concern. According to u/Natanael_L the functionality of the QR scanner can be duplicated within HTML5 anyway. Looking forward to the first wallet which implements this.

SCHENECTADY — The very week that New York’s financial regulators held hearings on the possible regulation of digital currencies, a Schenectady cafe and bakery became the first business in the Capital Region to accept bitcoins, a virtual currency created in 2009 that today still has many scratching their heads.
But that’s OK, according to local business owner Paul Paterakis. He doesn’t have to fully understand the thing. At the end of the day, his business just has to get paid.
“It is a valid currency,” he said. “It has an exchange rate. So we weren’t hesitant at all. It all comes down to working with the right company, and we have a company that ensures these bitcoins are real and result in U.S. dollars in my register.”
A bitcoin is a unit of currency just like any other, except that it only exists online. You can hold onto bitcoins in a virtual wallet or on computer software, and you can buy things with them as long as the person you’re buying from accepts them.
Perhaps it’s no surprise that Coffeetime — a
business whose name includes an “at” symbol — is the first in the region to try out this still-new virtual currency. Paterakis, a former GameStop manager, started his traditional Greek cafe and bakery shop in the Philippines and expanded it last year into Schenectady. He opened a local shop at 1491 State St. in September and within a month will open another one in Albany.
All of his stores are bitcoin-ready, said Paterakis. He uses BitPay, an electronic payment processing system for bitcoins that is available as a mobile checkout app on smartphones and tablets. When a customer goes to check out at Coffeetime the app will ring up their order and create a barcode that the customer can scan with their own tablet or smartphone. Scanning the barcode completes the transaction.
So far, more than 20,000 businesses and charities accept bitcoins with BitPay. The system allows businesses to receive payment in bitcoins, but the preferred method — at least for beginners — is to have the payment direct-deposited into their company bank account in the currency of their choice.
“We have had 20 transactions so far, and they have been mostly younger folks,” said Paterakis. “It’s just an extra currency that we now accept. Our employees are excited. They know that this is the wave of the future, and they’re excited to have the technology to do this.”
Chris Dosch knows how eyes can roll at such a statement. The 25-year-old materials science engineer at GE Global Research in Niskayuna became interested in bitcoins a few years ago and was actually the person who convinced Paterakis to accept the currency. He watched as bitcoins were met with skepticism, and he compares it to the skepticism prevalent when the Internet first came on the scene.
“People, by nature, are skeptical of it,” he said. “And it’s been hard for them to understand it when they compare it to their current use of currency because people don’t really realize how money actually works. The average person doesn’t know when the Fed is allowed to print more dollars and what the rules are, and that’s understandable. It’s complicated. But I would argue that bitcoin is less complicated than our current system of doing business, which people only trust because it’s been around for so long.”
In just the past few years, people have begun to accept that virtual currency is here to stay, said Dosch. Large companies like Overstock.com and Virgin Galactic have begun accepting bitcoins. And just this week, the New York Department of Financial Services held a two-day hearing on virtual currencies to discuss how state government should deal with the rise of bitcoins.
Coinmap.org, a sort of Google Maps for places that accept bitcoins, shows the largest concentration of bitcoin merchants in North America and Europe. In New York, most users are based in New York City, with the only upstate presence at three locations in the Syracuse area, two locations in the Rochester area and now two locations in the Capital Region. (Dosch said the other Capital Region location is new and is a frequent user of bitcoins rather than a merchant.)
The Capital Region has Dosch to thank for its bitcoin presence. He started an online forum for bitcoin enthusiasts on the site Meetup.com about a month ago in his search for fellow enthusiasts.
“It’s interesting to see how different their backgrounds are,” he said. “They are working professionals, economists, social media gurus, computer scientists and college students. My plan was to find people who are already interested in this and say, ‘OK, let’s go out there and tell businesses we’re really going to spend bitcoin if they will accept it.’ There are no downsides for them. We just need to get them over the initial skepticism hump that seems to follow this.”
It doesn’t help that bitcoins have attracted illicit activity since their launch. Last year, the FBI shut down an online black market known as the Silk Road that uses bitcoins. And earlier this week, the founder of a well-known bitcoin exchange company was arrested and charged with running an illegal scheme to sell the currency to drug traffickers.
Bad press aside, legitimate merchants don’t have to look hard for incentive to use bitcoins. While credit card companies typically impose a 2 to 3 percent transaction fee on merchants, bitcoin payment processors charge something closer to 1 percent.
Once Dosch found a local customer base, he sent an email blast to about 130 local businesses outlining how easy it would be to set up a bitcoin payment system and asking if they were interested. The response was a lot more positive than he expected, he said.
“I wasn’t expecting much,” he said. “Paul wrote back that he had heard of bitcoin and was interested. But even six months ago, people would just say ‘I don’t want anything to do with this,’ and that response is starting to switch to ‘Hey, I’ve heard about this, tell me more.’ If any business spent any amount of time looking into it, their decision would be, ‘Yes, I’ll accept it.’ ”

The most common response seems to be to refund in USD. I wonder if you'd have a problem with customers making purchases in BTC knowing they will be returning. I.e they now have a trustworthy place to exchange bitcoin for USD with no fees and they didn't have to intensely prove their identity to an exchange to do so.

I wish they could be imported via BIP38 so I could be carrying them around encrypted and not in plain text. Hopefully BitWallet implements this in the future.

My one problem with encrypted keys is that if anything ever happened to me, my bitcoin would be gone forever. I like having my pieces spread out in such a way that nobody would be able to collect m of them without me knowing (assuming I was alive). However, if I pass away, relatives and friends could take their pieces, and get the remaining piece(s) by going through my belongings or obtaining from locations that require a death certificate. 


I hadn't considered that. Thats great. Can't wait to try it out when the update is released.

I'm not talking about the regulation of bitcoin itself (or bitcoin transactions for that matter). I'm talking about that sort of licensees, bonds, insurance, etc. bitcoin-related companies face (exchanges, wallets, other services). Many of these are based on ensuring consumers don't lose funds as a result of negligence or malfeasance of the company (i.e. Mt Gox). The problem has been determining how large of a bond the company would need to hold if the value of bitcoin they're holding is fluctuating constantly. Also, how much do they need to pay into the insurance fund (for the same reason), which is typically based on the amount of USD they're dealing with. It seems to me that some time should be spent by regulators considering cryptographic ways of ensuring the bitcoin is still controlled by the company, and laws that cryptographically minimize the risk of theft of fraud. Considering solutions that take advantages of the unique properties of bitcoin seems like a much better idea than regulators racking their brains how to fit bitcoin into the current regulatory scheme. It doesn't seem like this is being give any serious amount of thought though unfortunately.

If this really concerns you, only use BIP 32 wallets. When you initially fund your spending wallet, use blockchain.info's shared send so you get tons of small inputs. Instead of sending $400 to your spending wallet, send 10 of your addresses $40. Now you have 10 addresses each with tons of small inputs. No more fear of getting robbed.

I think a user-friendly multisig app for both iOS and Android would be a great way to showcase the benefits of bitcoin to average Joe. So many potential uses:
-Friendly bets between friends, using a neutral friend as an arbitrator    
-Collecting funds at a poker game (removes the hassle of cash and risk of finger pointing if it doesn’t all add up at the end of the night)    
-Use in informal transactions like craigslist or responding to some other ad    
-A show of commitment (I promise I wont miss the next meeting, I’ll throw $50 in multisig to prove it to you)         
-A use in collection tip jars where you have no idea if the cash will go to the advertised cause. Use a public charity vetting arbitration service as one of the signatures    
-Many, many more    
 
    
Instead of focusing on the things bitcoin does better than credit cards, we should realize that average Joe would be more interested in things credit cards can’t do at all.

I've been to games organized through a local poker meetup.com group, and sometimes you get 20+ people who don't know each other very well with lots of cash on hand. As you said, occasionally the count at the end of the night will be off, not by much, but everyone starts pointing fingers. It would be great to have that solved. Not to mention its nice not to go somewhere where its known online that there will be lots of strangers and lots of cash.     
Another option would have poker inside the app (might be trying to do too much, but there would be some interesting potential here as well). Say you're somewhere with a large number of people. Waiting in line for something maybe? Everyone sends their BTC to a multisig address and plays a game of poker on their phones against each other. No need for cards or chips on hand. Even cooler if it could use bluetooth and not require internet at all.    
If we want to go extreme, all the shuffling could be provably fair:

Do a rough calculation as to how many people could have some if it remained 'successful' while being worth double digits (assuming USD). Sure, the velocity could be super fast. BTC could be automatically purchased at time of purchase, sent to the recipient, and immediately sold. But if bitcoin is still being used 10 years down the road, then it likely will have reached some form of stability. That means people will desire to hold some as it will be more stable than other currencies out there. Then go back to your calculation on how few people could hold some and still have it be worth double digits of USD. I'm not saying bitcoin is guaranteed to succeed, but the statements that 'it could work fine forever at $5' seem flawed to me.

Pheeva is not quite the answer. No ability for me to get ahold of my private key, no ability to sweep paper wallets, not entirely open source. Also, I thought the method they're using to install the app on your phone gave the installer some extra permissions (like the ability to see what other apps you have installed). I could be very wrong on the last one, but I thought most corporations that use this method to instal apps get extra permissions. Maybe Pheeva chooses not to employ them? In any case, it made me a bit nervous and I didn't find enough information to alleviate my concerns before I found a better iOS wallet anyway.

Double spending is of interest for retailers who want instantaneous checkout. These retailers aren't going to only check one low priority node before completing the sale.

Sent from the same address? Even if they were very small amounts, they still could have used up all (or almost all) of your inputs. I'll butcher the explanation, but when you send someone bitcoin, you don't just send them an exact amount. If you want to send .0002 for example, your wallet finds enough unspent inputs that are &gt;= to .0002, and sends .0002 to the receiver, and the rest back to you. So, if the inputs that were needed for this was almost all of your balance, it's likely that having those small unconfirmed transactions was the reason you didn't have a sufficient balance to make the screen-shotted transaction.

You still have your paper backup that you could import into another BIP39 wallet at any time. TREZOR just gives you a secure way to spend from your 'cold storage.' Losing or destroying your TREZOR does not put you at risk of losing all of of your bitcoin.

I tend to agree with you. They were using the same model as their credit card machines. I.e. the machine gets a fixed credit from the credit card, and returns the un-used portion. In its current form, this machine actually dispenses the change in fiat instead of sending back the bitcoin.

Regardless of which wallet was at fault, wasn't there a reasonable chance of the zero-fee transaction never making it into the blockchain? Or, even if it took hours to days to make it into the blockchain, that should be plenty of time to double spend with a higher transaction fee once the customer is long gone, no?

On a similarly off topic rant, I don't know why it isn't standard for wallets to have the option to send 'all.'

To sign a message from mytrezor.com, I need to specify the address I want to use to sign. I've tried a few and I get "Signature does not verify. Sign just 'Coinkite' without quotes, and give us the base64 signature."

For which part? Those were two desperate thoughts which probably wasn't so clear. 
Regarding my current spending habits, I only keep so much in mobile wallets. When I need more bitcoin, I take one of the BIP38 paper wallets out of my pocket and sweep it into my mobile wallet. 
Regarding 2FA, it would be really cool if my second factor was something I could take out of my pocket and scan (instead of switching apps to authy for example which would be on my phone if stolen). The 2nd factor should be something that changes after each use. I was suggesting a solution (admittedly clunky) where someone might import a list of public keys ahead of time (they can be bitcoin addresses, why not). When prompted for the second authentication factor, scanning a private key from any of your '2FA public keys' would suffice as the second factor. These would be one time use only. I'm sure there is a much better way to do this, but, being able to scan a QR code for a second factor would be great so it wouldn't be stored on my phone.

Very aware of that. That doesn't change the fact that by the time the blockchain service decides your transaction probably is never going to confirm (think this is 48 hours?) and adds the bitcoin back to your balance, if you try and spend it again now, your new transaction has a very high likelihood of confirming before your previous transaction that hasn't confirmed for two days. If your first transaction was to a coffee shop that accepted BitPay, you'd still have eaten your muffin two days ago, and now have the ability to re-spend that coin (to the best of my understanding). I could very well be wrong, but I've asked this in multiple places, and have tried to prove myself wrong through literature, and so far my (mis?)understanding hasn't been corrected.

This just replaces the scanning of a destination QR code (and amount). The goal being to speed up the checkout process. No secure info is being transmitted. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 16:14:04
Yea, below was my (probably a bit too long winded) response.    
While it is possible to accept bitcoin directly, that is not the norm for established businesses like dell, expedia, newegg, Wikipedia, overstock.com, etc. Just as one uses a payment processor for credit cards, one uses a payment processor for bitcoin (for example, BitPay). This allows you, the merchant, to receive your full sale amount deposited into your bank account the next businesses day just as your credit card transactions are (sans the credit card fees and fraud risks credit cards involve). Adding a ‘pay with bitcoin’ button to checkout is an extremely easy process. Any chance you could elaborate on what ‘extra element’ this would be adding? From the merchant’s standpoint it’s just a cheaper and lower risk way of receiving ‘real currency.’ No need for the merchant to ever touch the bitcoin. While I know new tech adoption doesn’t happen overnight, I am genuinely curious as to what downsides are perceived from businesses that have yet to add bitcoin to their payment options. The comments from companies who have added bitcoin payments are almost unanimously positive. Giving the customer an extra way to pay when it results in less fees for the merchant and reduced risk seems like a no brainier. If you are unable to add bitcoin payments at this time, that is completely understandable. However, if you have time, I would be very interested in hearing what the ‘extra element’ is which is holding LastPass back.     
Thanks for your time."

For those that don't care about the MilionareMakers sub, know that this could very well mean positive press for bitcoin. The donation post states you need to pay $1.40 for the winner to receive $1. If the winner gets enough of a prize to make headlines, it will likely come up that those who sent in their $1 via bitcoin paid little to no fees. Not to mention that the bitcoin blockchain was used to pick the winner. In a way it would be in best interest to throw some money to the winner in hopes this poormans lottery makes national news. The winner even has a good story.

I'm sure my printer could have designed a better USB port specifically for its needs. However, if every device I owned required a different port, it would decrease the utility for all devices. At some point it is best to pick a standard and do the best you can with it. At the very least let the customizations be backwards compatible. If this taxi service was built on the bitcoin blockchain, you'd have an instant community excited to use it. Now they'll be starting a userbase from scratch. Getting someone brand new to get into crypto is difficult enough. The more altcoins they're having to decide between the harder it is going to be for everyone. My interest is in wide crypto adoption because there are a lot of things that it would enable which I would love to see come to fruition. As a result, I see a fragmentation of altcoins as counterproductive to blockchain technology as a whole. For the most part, I will be choosing to avoid services which require alts. My personal opinion of course, but it seems to be one shared by many here. I guess it is up to these services to decide if the pros of an altcoin outweigh the cons. In some respects, it seems the answer to that question becomes more of a "yes" if the goal isn't long term adoption, but a short term pump and dump. This makes me all the more skeptical of alts.

I like this idea a lot. Potentially people will increase their donation if the charity is close to the completion of a goal. Also, I assume people would like knowing what their money was spent on. Not in a "I refuse to donate if I don't know exactly what item is being purchased" sort of way, but it would likely be more fulfilling knowing what you helped purchase. I know I prefer to get someone something cool off of their wedding registry instead of just giving them the same amount of cash. In most cases I spend more on a registry gift than I would have given in cash.

Circle charges no fees. The credit card company however charges circle 2.9%, which you pay if you want to use a credit card instead of a free bank transfer.

Average Joe doesn't even realize credit cards take fees from merchants. As the merchant receives the $97 from the bankers, the merchant should reluctantly look at the sale price that had been marked up to $100 from $97 when the merchant started dealing with 'the bankers.'

Would the rate of confirmation be close to 100%? Whenever the topic of accepting zero-confirmation transactions at point of sale comes up, everyone is quick to mention how inefficient it would be to attempt a double spend for a cup of coffee. However, I'm more interested in the success rate of zero-fee transactions. Maybe (hopefully) they will have nearly a 100% success rate of getting confirmed. But, this doesn't seem to be talked about nearly as much, or at all. The fact that 'there should be space' for these transactions seems much less reassuring than the argument against the double spend if I'm a store owner. In either case, I plan to test it out with a large number of various sized zero fee transactions and see what happens. They'll probably all confirm and this will be a non issue, but, I'm still curious to see how it turns out.

Obviously you don't want to clutter the image up with too many options. However, for instant online purchases with very low fees*, ChangeTip seems like a pretty good option for newbies to buy bitcoin (max $50 daily limit). It's worked great when I tested it out, but I don't think it's used often enough to know if it should be a go-to recommendation. I'd love to see it tested more to know if I should be recommending this option over telling newcomers to wait a few days for their bank accounts to link with Coinbase/circle or to pay credit card fees to purchase instantly.      
*Changed 'almost no' to 'very low' as it depends on the amount you buy. But still much cheaper than other instant online options before you have a bank account linked.

Currently the html 5 wallets pull up the camera (or let you choose a photo from your library) and submit a single photo a time. This works for good lighting conditions, but is a huge pain in low lighting as it takes many attempts. 
Alternatively, easywallet.org seamlessly pulls up any* existing QR scanner app on your phone to scan. This works way better, and I'm hoping these other html5 wallets adopt the same practice (as an option at least), or, explain why they're choosing not to go that route.

Well, hopefully the new transaction fee structure will fix this. There are plenty of non time sensitive transactions that use the 0.0001 fee because zero-fee gives too high of a chance of never confirming and there is nothing in-between .0001 and 0. It makes sense to have more control over the fee.

Easywallet.org opens up any QR app you have installed on your phone (a variety of free QR scanners work with it). There is almost no noticeable delay for the QR app to open, the code to scan, and for it to switch back to safari. It feels just like any mobile wallet app. The Coinpunk method of taking or uploading a single picture at a time works fine in good lighting, but as soon as it's a non-ideal lighting situation, its just not really useable to keep uploading single files to get the "could not process QR code message." I'd be really curious what you think after taking a look at easywallet.org and how difficult you think it would be to implement. Thanks!

My method involves needing one more key than I give out to people. I.e in your case, I would require 3 of 6.

"Works". You can't change the transaction fee. No reason for it not to be at 0.0001, 0.0005 is a bit steep for small transactions. Then, for an added layer of fun, it'll randomly not include a fee at all letting your transaction sit there for hours. So now, after using the app, it's best to go look up the transaction and make sure a fee was included. If you have any watch-only addresses you can't use the from: "any address" option because it throws an error as it tries to send from a watch only address. This would be fine if you could easily scroll over to a hot address, however, due to a bug, you can scroll all the way through the addresses three times before coming across a hot address. Quite frustrating in person if you're trying to send someone BTC. I know it's not blockchain's fault that they can't update it, but, anytime I see someone say "why is everyone complaining, the blockchain app works fine" I respectfully disagree.

In the mean time, volatility can be used to your advantage. Step 1) buy product or service with bitcoin, Step 2) wait for price of bitcoin to dip below the price at time of purchase, Step 3) rebuy bitcoin (effectively giving you a 'discount' on everything you buy with bitcoin).

OP was concerned the ice cream shop would know how much money he had accessible to him at that moment. With BIP32, your funds are stored in many addresses, not just one. The ice cream shop wouldn't know which other addresses were under the control of his wallet, just the address(s) used for the ice cream purchase. The user doesn't need to worry about all this. They just see a very easy to use wallet with a send and receive button. The average user might not even notice their 'receive' address is different every time.

You can go to circle.com and buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card. They charge 2.9% for the credit card fee, but if you're only buying a small amount to play around with that won't be terrible.

The killer iOS wallet for me will be one that lets me import BIP38 encrypted paper wallets (to add funds on the fly without too much bitcoin stored in an iOS app, which can never be 100% open source thanks to apple's closed garden), allows me to have access to my (encrypted) private keys in case the app were to disappear unexpectedly, and supports BIP32 so anyone I give bitcoin to can't track all of my future purchases. The ability to use the fingerprint scanner for added security would be great. For my current iOS wallets I don't require a password to send as it tends to be a bit of a turnoff when demo'ing bitcoin to people (i.e. one more step credit cards don't have). However, a quick fingerprint scan would mitigate that. Multi-signature support would be awesome as well.

Owner of two trezors here. The two features I am most looking forward to are below. Any updates on their status? Rough ETAs?   
**Some form of multisig**. I'd like to store my trezor seeds in n locations and require m of them to sign a transaction. While admittedly tedious having to wipe the trezor n times (or purchase n trezors), this would only be used for long term storage.    
**The ability to sweep paper wallets securely**. If I recommend someone switch their cold storage practices to trezor, I don't want them to also have to jump through hoops to run a clean OS from a bootable disk and check hashes of their software in order to sign an offline transaction to move their btc to trezor. While tedious, using a scrambled keypad (similar to that used for pin-entry but one square is a 'next' button for more letters) in order to enter the private key (and then the BIP38 password) would be well worth the time for piece of mind when sweeping large paper wallets.

Nope. The ice cream shop (or you looking at his transaction) will see small inputs, none of which can be easily traced, which combine to make the price of the ice cream (well, plus some, and change will be returned). You can see they're stored in an address which has $40 in it, but presumably you're not worried about theft over $40. They can't see it came from the $400. If however you're worried about the FBI as I mentioned to you'd want to put a bit more effort in here. However, I'm thinking thats not the use case you were asking about.
Edit: If you managed to spend over $40 at the ice cream shop, you'd need to go into inputs from another address, so the shop would see you had at least $80 on you. That said, as points out, this same thing happens with paper bills. The cashier (or those around you looking) will know how much change you put back in your pocket.

Next time I'm in a store paying with bitcoin, I'll have to test this out.

Do you think it would ever be possible for businesses to supply their category (and business name) at the time of transaction?     
It would be pretty awesome if it could work in the following way. A business creates an HD wallet which will create a new recieving address for every transaction (or BitPay/Coinbase/etc does this for them). When creating this wallet, they provide a business name and spending category. In the name of privacy, they wouldn't want this information available to everyone. If there was a way to encrypt this information, and only decrypt it if you were the FIRST payment to any of the addresses, that would be incredible. This way your private key would provide you with all of your transaction history but nobody else could see it.

Acquiring multiple tablets to do this also isn't something they want to pursue right now. Also, dropping off a slip of paper on a table takes only a second. Doing the transaction and QR scanning at the table definitely takes more time.

Is there a way to open a webpage by typing a URL and not scanning a QR code? For example, if I wanted to go to GreenAddress.it? Perhaps I didn't download the app you were speaking of.

That'd be a pretty big downside to using bitcoin if all of your returns could only be in store credit 
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:13:52
Gotcha. Bad example then. I just can't seem to rectify the fact that I know I've seen transactions go unconfirmed, and the fact that BitPay claims to never have experienced a double spend. I assume I'm missing something. But I just don't know what it is. How can I have no problems spending coin from a transaction that never confirmed and BitPay never have a transaction fail to confirm.

BIP32 is for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets. There are many benefits of HD wallets, but my main interest in an iOS app is that the receive address changes after each time you receive funds, and each time you spend funds the change goes into a different address. This means that if you send someone $5, they won't be able to just watch your address and track all of your subsequent (as well as your past) purchases. Every time you spend bitcoin it'll be coming from a different address without any extra effort on your part. There is only one master private key needed to back up all of your addresses. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 14:31:47
While I have you here, would there be any possibility of getting the option for a 2nd 2FA in the spending limits? I know currently you can require two forms of 2FA, but its all or nothing. I'd love to use, say, google authenticator on my phone for any transaction, but for transactions above X BTC, require an additional 2FA that doesn't travel with me. Google authenticator on a different device for example. Most likely just stored as a paper google authenticator backup copy. 
I know there is always the risk of over-cluttering the UI, so feel free to say no. Just curious.

@_date: 2014-02-19 15:04:31
How easy is it to alter the transaction ID? Wouldn't that leave this scenario fairly easy to pull off: the transaction ID from the first transaction is intentionally changed. Then the second transaction from B to D is in the form of an in-store purchase where the business uses BitPay or Coinbase to accept 0-confirmation transactions. It was my understanding that a double spend would be difficult here (and monetarily not worth it). Wouldn't your explanation of transaction malleability make this scam pretty easy to pull off? Or am I missing something? Thanks for the explanation +$0.5
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:13:23

While most of my wallet use right now is in the wallets which support BIP32, I still use bitWallet quite a bit for other purposes. For people who have never heard of bitcoin, I love generating a private key in bitWallet, sending $1-$5 to the address, and giving the private key to someone. People are much more interested in setting up their own wallet when they already feel like they own bitcoin. While sending someone a private key in plain text is horribly insecure, it does make for a great starting point for a bitcoin 101 discussion. People are intrigued that this long string of text is worth $5. Also, bitWallet is the best app I've come across for watching addresses. bitWallet is leaps and bounds ahead of all the other iOS wallets when it comes to providing transaction information. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:20:59
I'd be willing to bet mailbox app's implementation of this was a large contributing factor to the crazy demand. Everyone saw the number in the queue rising, and wanted to get in to see what the fuss was about.

It still holds that if all of the following assumptions are true, there is cause for some merchant concern. As nobody seems to be concerned about this, I assume I am incorrect on at least one of the following:
1) BitPay will display "invoice paid" to a merchant even if the customer did not include a transaction fee
2) Occasionally for various reasons, transactions never get confirmed, or, more specifically, don't get confirmed for a long enough time to where the coins are able to be spent again.
3) If a transaction that was used to pay a BitPay merchant goes unconfirmed, the merchant is out the money
1 and 3 are true, and while transactions with zero fees in theory should always confirm, hearing about and seeing transactions that never confirmed isn't overly uncommon. So, my original question is still "why isn't this an issue." 
I don't mean to continue this thread into oblivion. In the next day or two I'm going to start testing this, so see what actually happens (probably nothing). But, if someone has a definitive answer as to why this isn't a problem, I'd love to hear it.

This is my second most used wallet (and I believe I've tried them all so far). It loses points from me for not being able to type in a "send" amount in dollars and not being able to click a transaction to see additional information (just letting me copy and paste the 'to' address would be a good start). Other than that though, I really like this app.

This requires paying for two safety deposit boxes. With many options for Trezor multisig support around the corner (&lt;2 months and probably much sooner), I'm not sure I'd recommend someone get two new safety deposit boxes at this point. For example, a 3 of 5 multisig scheme would allow store 5 seeds in fairly secure locations. This would still allow for up to 2 of them being destroyed. As long as would be alerted before 3 of the locations were compromised, this solution would probably be better than paying for two safety deposit boxes annually. Personal preference of course, but maybe worth mentioning.

I see this chart lists "Support for unconfirmed transactions" under CoinPrism. However, it seems when I send someone an asset, they don't see anything that indicates they've been sent something until there is 1 confirmation. Is this true? Is there a reason behind this?

In before the typical biometrics debate. If you have enough bitcoin to steal that might make someone secretly record your heartbeat for [30 seconds] and steal a wristband off of you without you knowing, don't use this as a storage method. For everyone else, especially if a pin is thrown on as well, it seems this would be a pretty convenient option for a warm wallet.

Well for a m of n multisig transaction you would need access to m keys in order to approve any transaction, so it would only be for long term secure storage. i.e. not your more frequent Trezor use.     


When each seed is no longer a single point of failure, the security requirement of each location goes down. The requirement is that the critical number of keys not be destroyed or compromised before you realize and can make new pieces. This leaves a lot of flexibility. Maybe one key is very secure, maybe another is just very easy to tell if it has been compromised or destroyed (plain sight with a serialized hologram sticker?).

It wanted me to choose a category (say, researcher) and then choose a researcher based on their hourly rate and average turnaround time (on the order of days). I just wanted to list a very simple task, a price, and a timeline and if someone took it off my hands, fantastic. If not, no big deal. Bitcoin would be great for that. Way less overhead as well due to taskrabbit having to deal with credit card payments and disbursements.

A long time ago I sent .5 bitcoin to bitstamp in order to play around with Ripple and see what it was all about. However, now that .5btc isn't a meaningless amount of money, I wanted to get it back (and found out I'd now need to verify on bitstamp). So I sold .49992 bitcoin for XRP (through the ripple interface, but it was via bitstamp's order book). I then sent the 20,500 XRP to my new Kraken deposit address, I then sold the XRP at market value on Kraken for 0.58637 BTC, and immediately withdrew it to my Blockchain wallet. Now I'm thinking it may be worth getting verified on bitstamp to keep feeding bitcoin though this seemingly too-good-to-be-true arbitrage cycle.

With SSSS, once the pieces are combined, that person now has access to all the funds in the address.

"While healthy ECG signals from different people conform to roughly the same repetitive pulse pattern, small differences in the overall shape of their waves reveal significant distinctions between individuals. During authentication, the Nymi is able to ignore noise from recording artifacts that result from breathing, body movement or an inadequate connection and instead focus on pattern recognition to either accept or reject the user. Nymi’s pattern recognition engine uses a combination of second order statistics to extract unique ECG features. This allows the ECG wave to be analyzed for repeated unique patterns while factoring out artifacts
and incidental forms. Following this, machine learning techniques are employed to improve detection of the users unique ECG. During enrollment, the Nymi extracts features which are persistent in an individual’s ECG and at the same time distinguishable amongst a population."

I keep multiple addresses in BitWallet with ~$1 to ~$5 each in them. It's a great way to quickly copy and paste a private key (or private QR code image) to text or e-mail to someone. Super insecure way of transferring bitcoin, but for small amounts it doesn't matter so much. Usually these are sent to people who don't yet have wallets, so after they 'have some bitcoin' they're typically more interested in asking how to set up a wallet and sweep their private key. I've found people are usually intrigued when they get a long string of seemingly random text and I tell them it's worth $5.

I wish I could generate my own private key. One of the checks I like to do in situations like this is use the same seed on different versions of an app or program (windows electrum, mac electrum, older versions, etc.) and make sure they all generate the same keys from the same seed. I wish I could do something similar with Bither. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:37:42
In that case, I wouldn't be using the paper wallet more than once, and certainly wouldn't be paying $16 per use. I am impressed that this app made it into the iOS App Store though. I'd be very interested in a similar app that would let me track/spend my own BIP 38 Encrypted Private Keys on iOS instead of keys Verso created. Charge for the app. I'd pay. 
Edit for your edit: The question remains if there is any way to see if the iOS app you downloaded is unaltered from the public code.

I was going to buy that new mattress anyway. Might as well buy with bitcoin and rebuy the coin at a lower price. Maybe I don't have the extra income to put that same amount of money in the stock market and buy the matress. If the price of bitcoin never goes down, that's fine, I paid full price for the mattress as I would have with USD. I think it's a bit different than saying I could have done the same thing with the stock market. 
Edit: I guess I could have sold a mattress worth of stock, bought the matress, and re-bought the stock when the price dipped. That sounds like much more of a pain in the ass. Maybe if stores started accepting stocks directly for goods and services, then it would be closer to an apples to apples comparison.

Impressive. Thanks a lot. I'll keep an eye out for the more advanced user features to come. The killer wallet for me will be one that lets me import BIP38 encrypted paper wallets (to add funds on the fly without too much bitcoin stored in an iOS app, which can never be 100% open source thanks to apple), allows me to have access to my private keys in case the app were to disappear unexpectedly, and supports BIP32 so anyone I give bitcoin to can't track all of my future purchases. 
I really like the new gyft integration. However, the first to gyft cards I searched for were Amazon.com and Target. Neither seemed to be in the list of cards in Pheeva. Any reason why some cards offered on gyft.com are missing?

Did you guys consider doing anything on screen?

Some of their customers might want different things. By voicing these desires through customer feedback, companies can see which requests come in more frequently and act upon them.

@_date: 2014-06-26 01:54:12
Yea, the potential for someone to steal my phone and have the 2FA means my method of importing BIP38 keys on the go will still be my default for larger transactions. Having the second factor be something scannable by QR would be nice. Maybe you can import a list of public keys, and scanning any of those private keys would work as a 2nd factor? One time use only and you slowly just throw them away as they're used? I'm sure someone else could come up with something much better. Pulling something out of my wallet to scan as a second factor would be nice though.

Its short for multi-signature transaction. Where before a transaction can be sent, it needs to be signed by not one private key, but buy any M private keys out of a predefined pool of N private keys. This could mean a joint address owned by 5 people, and any 3 of them have to approve of a transaction. Or it could mean you keep one private key on your phone and one on your computer so an attacker would have to compromise both of your devices to steal your bitcoin (i.e. a 2 of 2 setup). There is a wide range of use cases. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:56:09
Depends what kind of multisig wallet you're looking for. Are you wanting all keys to be in your control (like BitPay's copay.io)? Or are you wanting one of the keys to be in the control of an entity that can enforce security rules (spending limits, 2FA, etc.) like greenaddress.it, bitgo, etc?

My problem is that with iOS, without a developer license you can't really confirm the source code. On Android its still not trivial from what I understand. I'd love to do a check to make sure my specific device wasn't compromised by importing a seed and making sure the seed generates the same keys on a few different devices (both iOS and Android). At least then I'd know the entire program was a scam, which I have more faith in someone other than I detecting. However, at this point it doesn't seem its possible to import your own seed, so I remain too skeptical to use it for any significant amount of cold storage.

I believe (correct me if I'm wrong that you wouldn't have any problems using the same seed, but just treat MyTrezor and GreenAddress as two separate wallets.

Clearly it's not an issue that can't be worked around. However, when onlookers see someone paying with bitcoin and it comes across as far more complicated than putting their credit card in the billfold (when it doesn't need to be), it seems worth mentioning. Even if its nowhere near the top 10 issues facing bitcoin, I think speeding up the process from 'ready to pay' to 'transaction pushed to the network' would be very beneficial for adoption. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:42:30


They don't. They accept 0-fee transactions just as fast as transactions with fees. As a merchant you can choose how many confirmations you want to wait for (with BitPay at least), but any POS is going to chose 0. Can't have people waiting 45 minutes sometimes if there is a big gap between blocks. 
I guess I'll have to experiment. I have a BitPay account. I'll just send myself $1-$5 transactions with no fees, periodically over the course of a week. See if any of them fail to confirm. If none of them fails to confirm, I'll be impressed/confused. If one fails to confirm, I'll have "stolen" from my own "store." Ether outcome will be interesting.

You can't put a number on it as it would be a competition with others.

It is open source, you have access to your private key (BIP38), you have the ability to sweep paper wallets (also supports BIP38 import).

It's not cheap if you're often sending people small amounts of bitcoin to get them started, or sending bitcoin back and forth with them to show them how it works, or donating small amounts when you see an address listed somewhere. 50 cents a pop adds up fast. If you tell somewhere "here is $5 of bitcoin for you to play with" and after two transactions they realize they're missing $1, it's not insignificant. I know the solution is just to go to android, and I plan on it when my contract is up. But it doesn't have to be that way. If CoinPunk or Blockchain could add the QR scanning that easywallet.org uses, everything would be fine on iOS. Bonus points if CoinPunk or Blockchain could add the private key import feature of easywallet,org to their mobile web interface as well.

Hmm good point. In every video I find, they seem to stress that you only need to authenticate once in the morning, and then it is good until you take it off. The fact that they keep stressing this and never once mention "how quick" it is to authenticate makes me think it might not be instantaneous. I don't see a time to authenticate mentioned anywhere though.     
Edit: Found the answer in their FAQ: "When you put the Nymi Band on, it authenticates you using your ECG in about 30 seconds. Once the Authentication is complete, the Nymi Band stops taking ECG readings."

Thanks. When people ask, I have to admit that without having set it up myself, I can only guess that it wouldn't take more than a day or so of their time.

I think solutions like GreenAddress.it are a contender as well. Funds are stored in 2 of 2 multi-signature addresses. GreenAddress.it can't spend your bitcoin without you, you can't spend your bitcoin without them*. This allows GreenAddress.it to prevent any double spends, as you'd need their assistance. Brick and Mortar stores would have no problems accepting 0 confirmation transactions from GreenAddress.it addresses because they know it can't be double spent. *GreenAddress.it's time-lock feature gives you access to your private keys after X number of days (you can adjust this). This means that if GreenAddress.it disappears, your coin isn't stuck in limbo forever.

They do update it, but if I download the update and install it, I still have the same question of the integrity of the new electrum version. Although, take a look at my response to Do you think that would work? Making sure the correct keys are being generated for a particular electrum seed? If it's generating keys correctly, and the pi never touches the internet again, I should be good to go if I'm not missing something (which I very well could be).

To be fair, the transaction you speak of did eventually go through. Not sure if someone re-broadcasted it as it went through after my post (that BitPay commented on). However, even though that particular transaction went through, I still occasionally hear of transactions with fees not going through for one reason or another (i.e.  It is my understanding that had one of these transactions been to a brick and mortar location, this person would have their goods and their bitcoin back (and once it had returned to their wallet, could easily be sent elsewhere with a very good chance of confirming) Am I wrong?

I've also seen this happen. Apple should add a quick toggle between PIN and touchID for when you start drinking or start getting tired in an unfamiliar location. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:02:48
When set to 'normal', the fee is still 0.0005 in the app. Five times as high as most other wallets. I haven't seen much difference in confirmation time between 0.0005 and 0.0001. 'Minimal' waves the fee all together, which isn't really an option because who wants to wait hours or days. Frustration in not being able to set the fee to 0.0001 aside, even when it is set to 0.0005, occasionally (though, admittedly rarely) the fee gets left off for no reason. This makes it a bit scary to use for larger transactions because you never know when a transaction is going to be sent without a fee (and it can't be checked in the app). This issue has been reported by others on reddit, and in my opinion is a pretty big issue.

How is it pointless? It allows someone to unlock their phone, computer, any apps that integrate with it with one touch instead of entering a password. Instead of a fingerprint which are left all over your devices and anything else you touch, someone would need the wristband (not any Nymi wristband, but this specific one) and a ~2minute mimicking of the user's heartbeat. Not impenetrable security by any means, but at the convenience of wearing a lightweight wristband, having instant access to your devices seems fairly useful.

An example: A website that keeps up to date numbers on the various bitcoin directories
The idea: A list of each known bitcoin directory (and link), # of brick and mortar listings, # of ATMs, and # of website listings. Stretch goal: rate of new additions (to see which directories are still being updated). 
When people ask for a list of places that accept bitcoin, I'd refer them here, instead of giving them a fragmented list of directories.

What about a 'donate towards specific features' model? I've already donated some to the project, but I'd donate more if I knew it was going to have the ability to import private keys (say, from a paper wallet) and the ability to dynamically scan a QR code (i.e. you're able to move your phone to focus until the QR code scans, not upload one image at a time at a high failure-to-scan rate). It'd be interesting to vote for features people want in the form of donations to specific addresses.

I appreciate the skepticism as I often rely on the same skepticism of others in the community to vet various claims. While its not much, as mentioned in the post, BitPay did retweet the funding link. Presumably they wouldn't have done so had my claims been false that they were copied on e-mails to/from both Papa Johns and the children's hospital. Furthermore, BitPay employees have retweeted, and also commented on this post. Also, the BitPay link has the business listed as Papa John's of Albany. To be approved for volume over $100 a day, BitPay requires documentation, so falsifying a Papa John's listing would require more than just typing in a fake name. As for me, here is a post from me previously when I helped our local Ronald McDonald House (also in Albany) with a LightHouse campaign.    
    
If you look around the related links, you'll see many people vetted that effort through multiple means (including multiple phone calls to the number listed on the main Ronald McDonald website). Additionally, you can see that same Ronald McDonald House has done an AMA, which was vetted by multiple redditors with healthy skepticism. As there is a lot more proof for that effort, hopefully that is enough to show I'm not some random username with no history in the community.

If you could split and recombine within TREZOR itself, there wouldn't be any added security risk. Correct?
Sure, if you made a 4 of 7 SSSS seed, all 7 pieces would be in the same location until you physically moved them. However, currently your backup is in the same location always with a 1 of 1 seed. 
I like the idea of multisig, but personally I like the idea of having more pieces than I'll likely be buying TREZORS. Dividing the pieces right allows for enough pieces you can get to quickly (same town for example) while having enough pieces in other states/countries to account for a natural disaster locally. I can easily ask a relative to hold old to a piece of paper with a security sticker on it for me. Buying enough TREZORS would be a much larger investment.

This would be much more useful if it could spend from BIP38 paper wallets. You could keep a handful of $20 encrypted keys on you, and spend them from Bity as need be.

One application I wanted to use them for is a cook-off type fundraiser for a local bitcoin accepting charity. Say for every .004 bitcoin someone sends to the crowdfund address, they'd get 1 voting token and 1 sample token. They'd walk around to the different booths/tables trying the different entries by paying with their sample tokens, and when they're done, they'd spend their vote tokens to vote for the winner(s). All bitcoin received gets swept the the charity in a transparent manor.     
The problem with telling everyone who has iOS to use the web version is two fold:      
-They would need to use a separate app for QR scanning and then copy and paste addresses into the website. Not exactly user friendly for someone brand new. 
-The web version doesn't support spending 0-confirmation coins/tokens. Someone could show up, buy their tokens, and then get stuck waiting for over an hour for a particularly long block which would be unacceptable.

I was thinking of a situation where a maybe a restaurant is giving out $5 coupons, but only wants them to be spent back at their restaurant. This allows them to have an expiration date where the restaurant gets the funds back if not spent.     
Or maybe you want to buy your friend a drink. You could send him $8 that can only be used at a specific bar. If he never uses it, you get the Bitcoin back.     
The problem with the signed transaction is you don't know exactly how much the bill will be. Say the restaurant is using the bitpay app. If you overpay you'd have to email bitpay for a refund.      
Edit: even more ideally, the restriction wouldn't be for a specific address, but for a specific tree of addresses for a given business or entity. This way the business could still use a different address per transaction, but the person would still only be able to spend the bitcoin there.

Yes, well, I wasn't aware of btc2sms.org when I posted this. I was thinking of the following (admittedly clunky) scenario. 
Dine at a cafe that accepts bitcoin (through coinbase or BitPay), receive the QR code for the bill, snap a picture of the QR code and text it to said service, the service responds with the QR data (public address and amount due). Copy and paste that into another text with a 'send' command to your SMS wallet service. 
However, since you already run a SMS wallet service, you could probably eliminate a couple of steps there. Maybe just MMS the photo of the BitPay or Coinbase QR code, and btc2sms.org could send a confirmation text back for the user to confirm the amount and address is what they were expecting. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:55:07
How so? Also, then the business would have to be set up to accept colored coins. It'd be great to know a friend was on a road trip, see he'd be passing a crepe place, and send him some money for a crepe. If he doesn't spend it there, after X amount of time I get the btc back. The crepe place doesn't need to be involved in advance in any way.

What about those obnoxious Sochi and Enjoy transactions. Those appeared outside of blockchain.info, but were never going to confirm. Now I know they were so tiny no miner would bother with them for no fee.

Yea, I've found people are more receptive if you say "here, this is worth X dollars", very quickly list a few places/websites they can spend it, and finish with "of course, you can always do nothing at all with it, up to you." Nine times out of ten, they'll want you to show them how to set up a wallet and ask more questions about bitcoin now that they have some. It's always awkward having to explain why it's not so easy to use their paper wallet immediately with an iPhone though. 
Also, for others who may not be savvy enough to look through the open source code, I kind of like the method of carrying BIP38 encrypted paper wallets (backups at home) and using them to instantly top-off web wallets as needed on the go. No downside to losing them and you can comfortably travel with more than enough bitcoin without having to trust an HTML5 wallet with it all. 
Thanks again for the work you've put into this. I'll definitely tell everyone about it at our next meetup.

Understandable. Interesting to hear the thought process, thanks!    
I think the winning combination would be finding the quickest and most simple way to convey that just by scanning said QR code, average Joe *could* receive money. Not that he is going to this time. But getting the message across that money could be transmitted that easily would likely be a powerful concept to anyone. Not just someone tech savvy enough to receive the funds that instant. The trick is getting that message across quickly and simply though. Perhaps thats not something that could be done with a mainstream audience yet. In any case, thanks for the response.

See GreenAddress's FAQ ( under "But what happens if your service goes away? Will I lose my coins?"     
If you lose access to your google authenticator backup, it would have the same effect as GreenAddress disappearing as they're the ones enforcing the 2FA.     
Basically you'd just have to wait a user predefined time (defaults to 90 days) until you can get access to your bitcoin with your Trezor (or Trezor backup seed) alone and not need the 2FA.

Well, the firmware needed hasn't officially been released yet. But you can get the update at stage.mytrezor.com. Then when you go to GreenAddress.it and click new wallet, you click the little button in the lower right corner of the mnemonic passphrase box. Looks like a double arrow and the mouseover text is "click to use hardware wallet seed instead." It should walk you through setup. Pretty straight forward and user friendly.      


It works with both I believe. I have been using the website.

The difference with the volatility of fiat currencies is the average user isn't very aware of it (for better or worse). If I give someone a $20 bill, even if it ends up being worth less in euros the next month, they're still going to be able to buy a $20 item in the U.S. with it. Very few businesses set prices in btc instead of fiat equivalents (and why would they with this volatility), so the volatility is very visible to the average user.

I've paid good money to take up other hobbies which I've gotten bored of much faster than this.

Maybe a donation campaign would help get out of the red from the initial development and get you guys closer to being able to lower the price for the masses. Seems there are a lot of people who appreciate the work that went into Trezor, but still can't afford one. Instead of that money going to knockoffs, if each of them tipped in appreciation to the work which went into Trezor, it would be better than nothing.

Just use a BIP 32 wallet. On iOS there is breadwallet, greenaddress, bitwallet. On android there is Wallet32, greenaddress, more I'm sure but I don't have an android. On iOS you can't get much more user friendly than breadwallet, so I disagree that the common user can't achieve an acceptable level of privacy. Is the FBI after them? Well then maybe they want to use a mixing service, but I'd say that goes beyond the "common user" and "acceptable level of privacy."

I had very little programming experience before bitcoin, and knew little to nothing about cryptography. I knew much less about the banking system than I do now. My overall internet security practices are much improved. Never would I have compared a piece of software's checksum before installing and I never went out of my way to turn on 2FA. This list goes on and on.

You could always write down 12 in multiple places and in plain sight. Then memorize the other 12 As 12 is good enough anyway, no need to care about security for the written 12. Now you still have your security from your memorized 12 words.

I plan to keep my seeds in different physical locations. When I want to spend from my cold storage, I go to each location, restore Trezor from that seed, and sign the transaction. If the multiple Trezors won't be in the same location anyway, why not just use one?

You could import your recovery seed into one of the wallets that supports it, and send the funds to your new Trezor/GreenAddress wallet. But I don't think there is a current solution to seamlessly to back and forth if MyTrezor is down.

Wasn't exactly advocating this as a resume blurb, however, if one wanted to go that route, they could certainly list any skills they picked up along the way.    
My career has little overlap with finance/law/computer science/cryptography/etc. However, there are definitely some useful skills I've picked up in the last 2-3 years that I certainly wouldn't have had I not become interested in bitcoin. Some of which could definitely appear as lines on a resume should I find myself ever wanting to make a career change. Those new skills have a value attached to them.

That works for small fluctuations. However, changetip will comment the dollar value equivalent, and when I send to their wallets their wallet will show the dollar value. Small changes aren't too noticeable, but large drops are and it makes it easier to wait for the bottom to resume the bitcoin demos/gifting. Hopefully that comes sooner rather than later regardless of the price. Having no good answer as to why the price is tanking can be quite frustrating.

My best guess would be you're typing in your passphrase slightly differently. I had this problem once. Since it doesn't give you a "incorrect passphrase" it just takes you to a different wallet, incorrect passphrase guesses only to keep seeing a balance of 0 can be quite disheartening.      
This is why I no longer use a passphrase and instead use 2FA through GreenAddress+Trezor. I figure with a passphrase the most likely cause of lost BTC will be myself (either through my written passphrase becoming compromised or my unwritten passphrase becoming misremembered). 
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:44:52

I completely agree that its possible. However, despite following bitcoin very closely since early 2012, I have yet to meet one of these people in person. It would make for a much more interesting discussion in my opinion. Effectively every bitcoin conversation I've ever had in person, on the phone, or via teleconference has been with those who have a very limited understanding or those who also have a fairly deep understanding but are believers in the potential of bitcoin (or, cryptocurrency in general). I know these skeptics with a deep understanding of cryptocurrency are out there (as bitcoin is far from perfect) and I very much look forward to sitting down with one at some point for a fun discussion. I would love for one to be a guest at our meetup some day. Wish they weren't so hard to find. 
Edit: I should add, I think a large reason for this is if you think something is worthless, why would you spend time your time and energy researching it's complexities? I think this ensures there will be very few people who truly think bitcoin is worthless but who have a deep understanding of the technology itself. Not that they're just too stupid to understand it or anything ridiculous like that.

Any idea of Coinbase or BitPay currently check to see how many confirmations the "me -&gt; you" has? I've never had a payment denied in person, but, maybe I always just had enough unspent outputs in my wallet to not run into my transaction not being accepted at a store. 


If someone was out there just changing as many txids as possible to cause chaos (which is what happened recently, no?) wouldn't this be a concern for these third party payment processors accepting 0-confirmation transactions? Or is this risk just rolled up into their payment model?

In settings you can choose between 'priority,' 'normal,' and 'economy' for transaction fees. These are calculated by the average fee required for confirmation times of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 60 minutes respectively. I've never had problems with unconfirmed transactions personally.

Edit: most of the below issues were fixed by killing the app and reopening. I'll leave the original comment in case anyone else has the same problem(s)
I was really excited about this, but the app is still very buggy (I'm on 7.1.1). 
Apparently sweeping BIP38 keys is not supported. It should say that when you try to sweep one. Instead nothing happens and it feels like the sweep button just isn't working. 
This also goes for the "show outputs expiring soon." The button seems to do nothing, when in reality I'm assuming I just don't have any expiring soon. 
When I go to change spending limits, I type in new limits, enter my 2FA code and nothing happens. Screen just sits there. 
This seems to be a reoccurring theme. It's hard to tell if something isn't working (in the case of the limits changing) or if the button is 'working' but just isn't meant to display anything (as with my first two examples). 
I copy and paste in a bitcoin address on the send tab, type in an amount less than my balance, and the 'send money button is greyed out. No message as to why I can't send. The button just does nothing.

Then the merchant would need to be involved in advance. See this comment (
 If possible it'd be nice to avoid that.     


Hmm this got me thinking. Maybe you do 2 of 3. 1 goes to the receiver (person B). One goes to an automated central service which keeps track of the authorized recipient and the expiration time. The third stays with the gift giver (person A) to get back after time expires. Then the business doesn't need to have any part in this, the centralized service can't steal funds, and the sender can get the bitcoin back after a certain time elapses. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:01:26
I'm not affiliated with Copay, but maybe the wallet is from before they switched to BIP39 backup seeds? Otherwise maybe the seed was manually deleted (something I do after I write mine down). Best bet would probably be creating a new wallet, writing down the 12 word backup seed, then transferring all of your funds over from your old wallet (made easy by the 'send all' button).

Except mycelium is pretty much android only as the iOS version doesn't have any of the same features.

You need a bank account to get cash out of Circle. That's the main difference. Also, since the burden of KYC/AML gets passed to the tellers, theoretically Abra could be available worldwide as soon as they get the kinks worked out. It would be much more difficult for Circle to achieve this. This is of course assumes Abra's model doesn't get them into any legal trouble. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:50:32
I'm not quite sure. I more just wanted to try it out since they raised all that VC money. Curious to see what the fuss was about. I assume it might be useful for remittance payments for those not wanting to go though the effort of buying bitcoin, or those wanting to send money to a family member overseas without having to teach the family member how to sell the bitcoin. Just go to a business with an Abra sticker in the window and deposit/withdraw cash. With enough competition, the fees should be significantly lower than western union due to the significantly lower overhead of bitcoin payments. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:26:33
I'd need proof of residency from someone outside of NY to sign up for a new account on Bovada since mine was closed. That's the more difficult part. Probably not worth it. Cloudbet for NCAA baseball and nitrogen for everything else is probably the way to go. Thanks though. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:42:10
Their current model has the KYC/AML requirements on each teller (unless you are buying from them through a bank transfer, then its on them). Presumably this will mean very low fees for some countries, and higher fees for others. Even in those countries with more strict KYC/AML laws, you'll likely have tellers not following them for a lower fee. See localbitcoins.com. Whether or not this model works is a different story. I'm interested to find out. I'm not willing to risk becoming a teller myself in NY, but others probably will. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:44:39
Yea, I experienced that as well. Had to delete the app to get around the pin issue. After re-download, signing up with e-mail and password (instead of through Facebook) worked.    
     
Also, found another bug with the bank deposit. If you select your bank through the search bar, it treats it as if you clicked the first bank on the list. No indication of this until the next step fails. If you just scroll down to your bank and click, thank works.     
      
More testing required for sure.

Agreed. I emailed nitrogen requesting it. Maybe that'll be effective. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 18:23:34
There is a warning when you click to become a teller than you're responsible for knowing the money tramission laws in your jurisdiction. Whether or not anyone follows that is another story. Also, you need to wait for approval to become a teller. Perhaps that approval comes with some additional information specific to your region. Who knows. I did apply to become a teller, but I named my business "for testing purposes only" and put down the address of a Starbucks. I doubt it will be approved. We'll see.

I just wish the BitPay wallet had some way to see the historical fiat value of a transaction like Copay. My bitcoin transactions are normally in unmemorable numbers. The round fiat amounts are often what reminds me what I purchased or if I was overcharged. Copay shows this value while the BitPay version of the wallet shows the current fiat value.

So far I haven't found any sites who have rejected the google voice number luckily. I agree that not using SMS is best, but when only using it for those sites that have no other option, google voice seems like a slightly more secure method than standard SMS for those unwilling to carry around two phones. Hopefully more and more sites will allow for google Authenticator instead of SMS.

My quote came straight from ledger documentation: 
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:59:15
I think I read elsewhere that Abra wants/plans to move to a decentralized oracle so that only a drop in the stock price can lead to a decrease in your BTC collateral. No other manual transaction could be approved without a signature from your end. Not sure how they’d go about proving that, or when that switch might be made. I’d also be interested in hearing more on this. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:31:35
I believe it’s a multisig wallet. Losing the seed phrase on your end does mean you lose access to your funds iirc
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:47:09
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:56:12
I'd be interested in hearing others answers to this. My viewpoint has been that if bitcoin doesn't reach widespread adoption, than the above concern won't matter. If bitcoin does reach mass adoption, the price will have to be orders of magnitude higher to support so many people using bitcoin. In that respect, the price now will be almost negligible. Compared to the hypothetical date of mass adoption, bitcoin is almost free now, and anyone who wants to buy a few bits can do so. Those with lots now will sell at the right price. Sure, it's risky to buy now hoping it'll be more in demand later. Therefore only some will do so. This is what will cause the inequality later (and has up until this point). This isn't unique to bitcoin though. Everyone still had essentially the same opportunity to get in early, and in the grand scheme of things, still does. Reward doesn't come without risk. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:47:03
Not necessarily. If bitcoin ever reaches widespread adoption BitPay and other competing companies won't be necessary. You won't need to convert back to fiat, you'll just spend the bitcoin you receive to pay employees, other vendors, etc. The same argument does not apply to credit card companies.

Again, these fees are on the consumer/sender side. While not irrelevant, that's not what is being compared here. For a merchant, a bitcoin transaction is still as cheap as cash (excluding initial cost of buying a tablet, training staff, etc.). Costs related to sending bitcoin I lump into the same category of annual credit card fees, bank account maintenance fees, ATM fees to withdraw cash. These aren't things merchants care about.

I recently switched from Breadwallet to Copay for my main mobile wallet for a number of reasons (in no particular order).        
1.   I can have multiple wallets in one app. A multisig wallet between colleagues, a multisig wallet between devices I own for more secure storage, and my low-security on the go spending wallet.    
2.  My low security wallet can be pin-free for quick access. I already have a pin for my phone, and don’t have much in this wallet. I appreciate the no pin option.

With credit cards, the merchant's concern is if they charge a customer $10, how much of that they'll see. The merchant doesn't care if you pay a $60 annual fee on your credit card. In this case, BitPay isn't charging the merchant any fees. The consumer is still paying a small miners fee, and is likely paying slightly above market value to BitPay, but from the merchant's standpoint (or in this case, the school's standpoint), this is still a 0 fee transaction.

Up until a few days ago I would have said BreadWallet hands down. My comment history reflects this as well. However, I recently switched to Copay for my main mobile wallet for a number of reasons (in no particular order).    
    
1. I can have multiple wallets in one app. A multisig wallet between colleagues, a multisig wallet between devices I own for more secure storage, and my low-security on the go spending wallet.     
2. My low security wallet can be pin-free for quick access. I already have a pin for my phone, and don’t have much in this wallet. I appreciate the no pin option.     
3. Like BreadWallet, it lets me spend funds which have not yet confirmed (something that can’t be said for a lot of other wallets).      
4. The transaction history tab contains more information. For example, if it was a payment to a vendor using BIP70, the vendor info will be shown.     
5. You can click the transactions to view more information on the blockchain.    
6. While it is not an SPV wallet, which is a downside, the upside at least is no time waiting to sync if you haven’t opened it in a while like BreadWallet.

8. The transaction fee can be adjusted. BreadWallet transactions took days to confirm during the high stress periods recently. I do know BreadWallet is addressing this in the next update.

Good to know. That was a much needed fix. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:31:43
You just type in your passphrase as you go. Any passphrase is valid. How could there be a limit of 8? Ledger on the other hand stores the passphrases on the device and they get tied to a specific pin, hence the software limit there.     
Edit: I missed the copay question.  An open source wallet that works with both ledger and Trezor. Useful for multisig wallets, or for ‘watch only’ wallets with alerts/notifications, or just if you want a backup wallet should there be any issues with the standard trezor/ledger web interface. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:17:47
Hopefully some standard is created around this type of seed splitting. It would be a great tool to have for saving hardware wallet seeds. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:09:45
I guess my point is, if you wanted to actively use two or more different passphrases, you should get a trezor and not a ledger as that would be super tedious. I think it’s worth noting when someone is deciding between the two devices.  Personally I’d love the ability to load multiple passphrases info ledger with multiple different pins. I think that would be the best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:18:04


I disagree. You can still use it as a duress passphrase even if it’s on. You just have one passphrase for your regular use / smaller value wallet and nobody can prove you have a second passphrase with other funds. All the extra steps you listed for the trezor are completely unnecessary.     
      
    
I much prefer this route as it allows my day to day funds to still have a passphrase. If someone were to get access to my seed words, they still don’t have my passphrase.     
      
There are other potential reasons for multiple passphrases. Two family members using the same hardware wallet. Keep the seed phrase safe together, but for regular use the passphrases keep the funds separate (gift buying, etc.). Maybe you want to use the hardware wallet for demo purposes and don’t want the full value visible. Maybe in a pinch you need to give someone access to your hardware wallet. You can tell them one of the passphrases knowing the remaining funds are still safe until you can move them.     
      
I do prefer Ledger’s method of passphrase entry. Maybe one day more passphrases tied to pins will be possible. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:11:10
*My ongoing list of pros and cons for each. Leaving the often debated hardware security  / open source aspects out*
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Makes you double check all 24 words which prevents mistakes 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦I wrote down one ledger word wrong before and it was a pain to figure out when restoring
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Supports unlimited number of pass phrases simultaneously 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Can use single accounts with copay, potentially useful for setting alerts/notifications (copay ledger support is only for multisig)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦One handed operation makes it easier to conceal screen in public
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Passphrase susceptible to key loggers
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Can't confirm which passphrase was typed without revealing plain text on computer screen
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Passphrase visible on the ledger screen by comparison is a nice feature
 
 
 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Natively supports more tokens
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Don't need to type passphrase into computer
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Slightly larger temperature range
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Ledger nano S
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•-13°F to 185°F
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•-4°F - 140°F 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Process of entering in recovery phrase is a bit faster than doing so on a Trezor
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Doesn't show full address in confirmation screen. Just beginning and end. This could be taken advantage of potentially. 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Using more than one passphrase regularly is tedious as only one can be stored at the same time.  Others need to be entered on the device each time which is time consuming.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦When trying to send tokens from my ether wallet (MEW) If you are using Ledger Wallet then you may get “Invalid status 6a80” and will have to enable contract data in the application settings.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Turning on and off browser support in settings to use MEW can be a pain. 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Common to get "waiting for ledger" hang-up when using copay 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Security note when using two passphrases:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦'If you provide one PIN to an attacker keeping control of the device for some time, it can be leveraged to try to brute force the other PIN, as the counter is reset during a successful PIN input, and both PINs share the same retry counter in current firmware versions. The best course of action is to restore and transfer your assets to a different seed quickly if this happens."
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦Device reset after 3 attempts feels a bit short. I've came close to having to restore my device a dew times. "First attempt I might have made a typo, now for my second attempt, do I try my pin again in case I made a typo, or, should I try the second most likely pin it could be?" Makes the third try a bit stressful. Particularly if access to your backup isn't easy to come by.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;◦When recovering the device, the U2F counter doesn't reset, so you'll have to preform a number of dummy authentications until the counter is higher than what it was before reset.
 
 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:15:48
Yes, but only one at a time. If you planned to actively use 2 or more different passphrases,
the trezor would be the way to go as the ledger would make this quite tedious. For one passphrase, the ledger is better in my opinion. It is entered on the device itself rather than the live computer’s keyboard. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:41:20
Are you sure? I thought it was one main pin (no passphrase) an optional second pin (which can have a passphrase) and then manually entering additional passphrases. I agree that it’s not common for people to use more than one passphrase. However, I still think it’s worth noting as it is a difference between the trezor/ledger. Having two pins on the ledger each tied to a different passphrase would be useful to me, but I didn’t think that was possible. I’ll have to try again. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:12:55
I think this will be very helpful for splitting up and storing hardware wallet seeds once it has been tested a bit more.

For the most part they all fall into the category of minor user preference type things. I recommend either. Both have some things I prefer over the other. I like having both so if there is an updated feature with one, I can use that. Or, if there is an issue with one, I can avoid using it temporarily. Always good to have options.

This is my list of pros and cons regarding the trezor and ledger. I'd also be curious to hear from more people regarding which hardware wallets they use and why; especially others I have't tried. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:25:46
Disclaimer: I’m on mobile, so this comes from a quick search. I was going to suggest using Trezor with an offline instance of electrum, but it seems from the first few results, people have had mixed results with that. My next suggestion would be a 2 of 2 multisignature wallet with electrum. One signature comes from the hardware wallet on a live computer, the other comes from your offline computer (move the signed transaction to an online computer via USB stick to broadcast). This way you get the peace of mind redundancy you’re looking for. The downside to more unique solutions is if they break, there aren’t as many users with the same issue to create urgency of getting it fixed quickly. Another option is to split the funds between more frequently used storage methods so if any one fails you don’t lose all your funds. For example, maybe put some in a ledger, some in a trezor, some in a multisignature address. Any three of those options will have enough users to where an issue will be quickly reported. If something terrible happened you’d still have 2/3 of your funds. Might be better than the uncommon use of an offline hardware wallet. Would hate to be stuck without access to your funds while waiting for an issue to be fixed that nobody else is experiencing.

There are a lot of great wallets out there. BreadWallet is my go-to. The number one reason being that it allows you to spend bitcoin without waiting for a confirmation. Usually when I'm refilling my mobile wallet, it's because I'm in a situation where I want to spend that bitcoin momentarily. Not having to wait for a confirmation before spending is a big advantage over other wallets in my opinion. Also, it does have TouchID support.

I don't have a list, but I do have a relevant email/review of one such combined POS system from a restaurant in our area:       
"I recently switched POS systems (POS Revel). One of the reasons I switched to Revel is because it offers tons of alternative payment options: Bitcoin, Apple pay, Paypal….       
 
Accepting alternative payments is something that I consider important for many reasons.         
 
When I made the switch and began the process of setting up my bitcoin integration the revel team responded with “Coinbase has been changing many of there privacy and security settings. This has forced us to stop allowing integration for the moment until they sort things out”.         
 
I’m a little pissed off because this was one of the reasons I switched (I don't really care about apple pay or paypal as much. They are just a different form of a credit card in my opinion.)"

The below is from a previous support email. Any chance the changes made it into this update? Thanks!     
"Hi ItsMillerIndexTime,
I have discussed your remarks with our developer and here is the outcome:     
     
**Current state:**      
 TREZOR does not check for the exact type of output script, so it will sign the transaction if GA gives it either 2-of-2 or 1-of-2 multisig output (for change address). What it checks is that the set of public key {xpubTREZOR, xpubGA} is the same for spent outputs and change address. So GA can't secretly change parties in change address or send the change to completely unrelated address. Nevertheless the attack from GA you mentioned is now possible.      
       
**Future state:**       
Base on your feedback, we will make following changes to firmware in near future.        
1) "Eye" function will not only display the address on TREZOR, but it will also display the type of the m-of-n multisig. So you can check when sending new funds to GA that you are actually sending it to 2-of-2 multisig type.         
2) TREZOR will for the exact type of multisig, so GA won't be able to do switch from 2-of-2 to 1-of-2 secretly. If they modify the type of script in any way, the output change address will be shown as standard output leaving your wallet (note that real change output, which can be spent by your wallet are never shown by TREZOR)"

I think it's always best to move bitcoin out of an exchange into a wallet where you control the bitcoin as soon as you buy any. Sending bitcoin from your own wallet will mean a much lower chance of your Coinbase account getting frozen. I have seen a few reports on here of Coinbase tracking bitcoin one or more hops after it left their wallet. This seems pretty sketchy. How does Coinbase know you didn't pay a merchant who then went and played poker? Overall, probably not the best idea to send from Coinbase to a betting site.

Fantastic news! Can't wait to try it out this evening.     
Somewhat of an unrelated follow up question while you're here. I really want to try out Coinprism at some point to issue tokens to be used as event tickets. However, in order for people to 'buy tickets at the door' or for tickets to be re-sold close to the start of the event, spending of zero confirmation inputs would be required. Wouldn't want to get stuck waiting over an hour for a block and miss the start of the event you just paid for. I believe this is possible on your android app, but not on the website (i.e not for iOS users on mobile). Any chance this will ever be changed? Thanks!

It would not be difficult to keep a log of private keys and auto sweep them should anyone send bitcoin to any of those addresses. If this is the case, they'd have a decent chance to beat you to the second transaction. While probably not likely, there is also no advantage for this method, only added risk.     
Are you going to keep repeating this method with 5 new offline keys each time you need to pull from your cold storage?     
Once you publish a transaction and send it to one of the 5 addresses, now what? How to you securely spend those funds? Create a new transaction on an offline computer?   
This technique has no benefits over multisig and only drawbacks. If you want to do it this way, go for it, but I don't see the point when there are more secure options out there that take less time to implement.            
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:39:32
As many have noted, ideally you'd fix the entry so it would no longer be a problem for others. In reality, it's not that easy. Every time I travel I try out new coinmap places. The most common response I get is "sorry, the owner isn't in today and he/she is the one who knows how to use it." I don't really want to delete their coinmap listing.

Copay. Can use it on multiple devices (iOS, android, desktop). Can really tailor your security with different m of n multisig configurations between devices (or other people). Choice of pin or no pin, fingerprint authentication or not, can have it generate your 12 word wallet seed or you can provide it yourself. Option to use unconfirmed funds or not. Overall I love the interface.

You can regain access to your funds with this tool:      
       
Note, you must wait for your deposits to expire (look up nLockTime transactions). This is set to roughly 90days by default in GreenAddress, but you could have changed this in settings.     
I'd be pretty upset if GreenAddress COULD reset your 2 factor authentication. That would completely defeat the purpose of it.

This is a good question. I just created a $30 BitPay invoice and paid $2 of it to see what will happen.     
This was a bit tricky to do though, as wallets that support BIP70 pull in the amount due when you scan the BitPay QR code and typically don't give the user an option to change it. Seems unlikely that someone would have paid less than the full invoice amount.     
I'm less concerned about what actually happened, and more concerned that the merchant thinks he has tried contacting BitPay without success. Sharing this experience with other merchants in the area and local media outlets hurts adoption. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:47:19

If you want to put on your tin foil hat, there is one concern I have about using TREZOR with GreenAddress for large amounts of bitcoin. When first creating your 2of2 multisig wallet, TREZOR does not actually check or display anywhere that a 2of2 was created. For example, if GreenAddress went rogue, maybe they have you create a 1of2 instead, so at any point in the future they don't need your key to spend. An unlikely scenario, but I'd feel much more comfortable knowing for sure my TREZOR was needed to sign any transaction. After the initial wallet setup, TREZOR does make sure all subsequent inputs and change addresses belong to the same tree, so the only security issue is on the initial wallet creation.      
The good news is after contacting TREZOR, they said they would fix this in the next firmware update. I.e it will show the specific M of N on the TREZOR screen. Until then, this concern would be present for any TREZOR multisig implementation. Not just GreenAddress. Though, I'm not sure there are any others out there yet.

I'm guessing their interest is in wanting to pay with bitcoin at their school. If it's just used as a way to fund their current lunch accounts, that probably isn't as interesting to them (though I could be wrong). Additionally, I'm sure a 3rd party controls those accounts, so the school probably wouldn't have much say in how they were funded. I agree that this is the simplest solution though. Regardless, a wallet with parental controls would be useful.      


While I agree, it would probably be a hard sell for many parents to switch from a funding method where they know their money will be spent on lunch to one where they're just giving their kid cash. Especially when many parents will have the bitcoin misconceptions the media has povided them with.

It's not as if the bitcoin itself has changed at all to be less fungible. It's just not fully yours, and so you have an automated approver deciding how it can be spent. I wouldn't think this would have a detrimental effect on bitcoin itself. If one ATM owner is only dispensing bitcoin to addresses which have passed a KYC compliance pre-check, and the market doesn't like it, they won't get as much business. I wouldn't see the bitcoin in the ATM as being less fungible though.

If you're just getting into bitcoin, I'd recommend BreadWallet. It allows you receive bitcoin to your wallet, and then send it out again immediately without waiting for a confirmation (average of 10 mins, could be as long as 1.5 hours). This is really helpful when you're new and playing around with transactions. I don't know of any other wallets on iOS offhand that allow this. Most require a confirmation first. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:06:55
I gave that a try. The wallet creation seemed to go well. When I tried to sign a transaction I got a new error: "BADREQUEST: required argument missing." Upon googling, I only saw one instance of this error mentioned elsewhere which was solved by adding the feePerKb argument. I'll have to play around with it some more. Was hoping to avoid having to manually create and broadcast transactions, but I guess if all else fails there is always that.

Copay would require a parent to be available at the time their student was buying lunch to approve the transaction. Quite a hold up in the lunch line. The functionality I am hoping for is one which auto-approves transactions to whitelisted merchants.

I would love to start recommending Airbitz for some of these great features, however, for newbies the waiting for 1 confirmation before spending kills it. With BreadWallet I can show them how to download a wallet, use a bitcoin ATM, and then immediately buy a coffee with the bitcoin they just bought. With Airbitz they might be waiting for over an hour for a confirmation.        
         
I also wish I could recommend the Airbitz merchant directory to newbies. Unfortunately if they're not using the Airbitz wallet on iOS, the directory steals the URL handler. I wish the directory could be a standalone app, or have the option to turn off the URL handling if the Airbitz wallet isn't being used so clicking "pay with bitcoin" links would take them to BreadWallet still.

How are you planning to know its been compromised? Wait until you broadcast your transaction and find your bitcoin instantly swept elsewhere? You could keep the private keys on paper with a hologram sticker to ensure it has never been opened I suppose. There are so many additional downsides to that method which multisig solves though. Why not just use multisig?

A while back I contacted Trezor requesting the ability to type in a private key from a paper wallet in a similar fashion to the scrambled pin code entry. Yes it would take some time to enter a full private key, but for those with legacy paper wallets who don't want to deal with an offline computer, it would be worth the piece of mind.

The previous post was more jest than my full opinion on the matter. I think calling every alt a distraction is overkill. I think some alts will prove to be a good testing ground that would be too risky to implement into bitcoin without extensive testing, and might not get the right testing in a testnet environment.     
There will be many conflicting "successful features" as well which can't all be implemented. I think we're bound to have multiple cryptocurrencies used for different purposes long term.      
All that said, the argument for which is best does feel like a distraction to newcomers. For example, something like When there are people completely new to crypto who just want a way to give $1 to the winner and it turns into a battle of which coin is best seems like a distraction. A new restaurant accepting Bitcoin and deciding to accept 5 coins at the same time. I think that can work against adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. Perhaps this is what Brian was talking about.

Sorry, that was dumb. I had just been looking at this page  and didn't see GreenAddress listed under 'Payment Protocol Support.' However, I should have realized that page is a bit out of date considering MtGox is still listed. Also I somehow glossed over the fact that when I pay BitPay invoices, bitpay.com shows up as the recipient. Clearly GreenAddress supports BIP70. I'll blame how late it is on EST time.          
On that note, when I go to do a test transaction by donating to the Ronald McDonald House, GreenAddress shows the recipient as 'BitPay.com', while Breadwallet shows 'BitPay invoice for merchant Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Capital Region, Inc.' Is there a reason GreenAddress doesn't show the merchant?

Thanks for the response. I tend to not keep much bitcoin in mobile wallets. As a result, I'm often toping my mobile wallet up, and usually this happens shortly before I want to use it. I don't think I'd ever be able to commit to a mobile wallet that didn't allow for the spending of 0 confirmation inputs unless double spending started to become a significant problem. Additionally, a good chunk of my mobile wallet transactions involve showing bitcoin to newcomers. The ability to send them some, and then have them pay for a meal, or donate it to a charity, or send that btc somewhere else immediately without waiting for a confirmation is huge.     
What if you had two different wallet types. One that didn't allow the spending of 0-confirmation inputs and one that did. You could put out a disclaimer, or maybe even recommend it be used for demonstration purposes only. Find a concise way to inform the user of the risks and let them choose?     
Back to the first comment, is a setting that would turn the URL handling of "bitcoin:" links off feasible in iOS? I.e if someone just wanted to use the directory but not have the app grab every 'pay with Bitcoin' link?

@_date: 2015-02-20 08:03:26
I’m not sure how common my use case is, but I often find myself in situations where it would be useful to not wait for a confirmation (beyond 3 demo transactions). I don’t keep too much bitcoin on any mobile wallet, so there are often occasions where I need to top-up breadwallet. Say for example after a conversation about bitcoin, a friend wants to give me $100 cash in exchange for bitcoin and I only have $50 worth in breadwallet. I usually have some paper wallets on me, which I can sweep into breadwallet and instantly spend. The paper wallet is coming from me, breadwallet is putting a reasonable fee on it, I see no reason to wait for a block in order to spend this.  Telling them I have to wait 5 minutes to an hour before sending them the bitcoin they just handed me cash for would border on embarrassing after mentioning how quick bitcoin is.      
     
Someone on reddit today was just searching for a wallet to hop through quickly to move bitcoin from coinbase to sealswithclubs to play poker. If the transaction is coming from coinbase (very unlikely to double spend), and going to sealswithclubs which already requires multiple confirmations before they give you poker chips, I don’t see any need to slow things down with an additional confirmation through the mobile wallet.     
      
Other frustrating situations I have ran into with wallets which require 1 confirmation is if you go to pay for something, but accidently underpay. If the amount was close to your wallet balance, and your change is now unconfirmed, you’re now stuck waiting for that to confirm before you send the remaining balance.    
What if when the wallet doesn’t have enough confirmed inputs to make up a transaction, it pops up a warning screen. I’m not sure what the best warning would be, but it would get across the following:     
     
-Only advanced users should proceed     
-Spending bitcoin from transactions which have not confirmed comes with the risk that they might never confirm, and if they fail to confirm, this current transaction will fail as well.       
-Only proceed if the unconfirmed bitcoin you are about to spend come from a source you know isn’t attempting a double spend (i.e. another wallet only you control)
-Preferably only proceed if the bitcoin is being sent to someone you know who can contact you should the transaction never confirm.        
-Paying for goods and services with bitcoin you expect will never confirm is fraud     
          
All of that would obviously be far too wordy.  Ideally a more concise warning would deter users who didn’t know what they were doing from continuing with the transaction, but allow those who knew the risks to continue.  Maybe the warning only appears when the wallet is in an ‘advanced mode?’

Have you had success with this? I get the error "Cannot join the same wallet more than once." I suppose I would need one laptop for the Ledger and one for the TREZOR?

Might I suggest the option to select multiple trusted agents for a transaction and the first one to check their email and accept is the one used? Seems that would speed the process up.      
          
Also, selecting multiple trusted agents and allowing one of them to be selected at random would be a useful feature. This would make the dance over agreeing on a trusted agent much easier. I select 1 or 2, the seller selects 1 or 2, and the one we use gets randomly chosen.      
         
Edit: Both of these could be grouped together pretty seamlessly. Enter multiple agents, and then check either "choose randomly" or "choose first to respond."

1) Yea, but not on the app, which was the purpose of the initial post. Crappy app selection on iOS.
2) Not having any brick and mortar stores in my area that accept bitcoin, I don't use my wallet much out. Most of its use is to demo bitcoin. In this regard, I really want to have a way to import paper wallets. It's the main reason I'll be switching to android as soon as I can. 
3) I could deal with this on my own, but while introducing someone to bitcoin, it borders on embarrassing fumbling around trying to find an address that isn't a cold, watch-only address as newbie here stares over my shoulder to see how "easy" it is to send and receive bitcoin.

I'm betting that it will be fairly infrequent that someone actually does it (hence the honk so they can't snap a photo and ask for money later). Of course, it will happen from time to time, but the trick will be to make the 'reward' low enough to where the payouts are less than the entertainment value + value of introducing others to bitcoin. $5 was my best initial guess.

You can't buy something that isn't up for sale. Slightly over 12 million bitcoin has been mined, but only a tiny fraction of that is on an exchange 'up for sale.' As someone started buying every bitcoin listed on the exchanges, the price would skyrocket (supply and demand). This individual (or group) would no longer be able to afford to keep buying.

You could make that argument about anything really. If you knew a certain gold coin used to belong to Michael Jackson, and therefore some people wanted to pay more for it, I don't think that really reflects on gold's fungibility as a whole. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:04:39
It could really use some updating. In order to make the "scan private key" button become visible you have to archive an address. The transaction fee can't be changed and it's set to 0.005 BTC, so ~$0.40. If you have a lot of addresses, when scrolling through the "from" addresses to send a transaction, they don't all show up always. Sometimes I go through the loop 2 or 3 times to find the address I want to send from.

Well, really the main concern would be the private key for C. Your weakest link would be the confidence that your private key was truly randomly generated. However, is there any way to store bitcoin that doesn't come back to that same concern eventually? The method I've found I have the most piece of mind with is the Piper paper wallet printer. Trusting someone more code-savvy than I has combed through the open source code to ensure sufficient entropy. Piper also provides the ability to create offline transactions using pre-installed electrum. When done, trash the SD card Piper uses. I'm open to any more secure methods of private key generation if anyone has any.

Still not a perfect workaround (yet). The ability to sweep paper wallets and improved reliability when scanning in QR codes (subpar to any wallet I've used so far) are both needed. Its still very new though.

@_date: 2013-11-18 01:22:32
Try blockchain.info (the website, not the app, which wont recognize encrypted private keys). However, instead of "Import Using Paper Wallet" and scanning with a webcam (which doesn't work for some reason), use "Import Private Key." If you go this route, it should prompt you for the password and you should be good to go. webqr.com works if you need somewhere to scan the encrypted key before pasting it in.
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:09:11

Its definitely not the entire criteria. In the past I was of the opinion that a case could be made for jailbroken iOS or android. I personally preferred jailbroken iOS, but to each their own. This is the first time I feel like I have no workaround, and the first real time I've felt I couldn't use my phone how I want to.

@_date: 2013-11-18 06:59:59
Also, the comfort of paper comes from knowing that nobody has seen my encrypted key. Even if I had the most secure password, the slim possibility that someone could get access to the encrypted wallet and be trying to break it, however unlikely, would still be in the back of my mind. With paper (and/or USB) copies, I will have physical evidence that someone has tried to gain access before they can even think about trying to break my password. Definitely more piece of mind there. Rational or not, piece of mind certainly factors in to storage. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:27:15
If it ended up catching peoples attention, it seems like it could be an entertaining way to get people to look into bitcoin on their own instead of being preached at. The more people in my area who know what bitcoin is the better. The less I'll need to drive to get to a brick and mortar location that accepts bitcoin. Plus, someone driving by honking and waving to say they just sent $0.05 in anticipation of their $5 is definitely worth a laugh.

Is there any way to fetch Coinbase's 'sell' price instead of using Bitstamp? I know they're often similar, but sometimes there is a decent gap. To me, the value of a bitcoin at any given point in time is what I could sell it for. I.e, it's value to me is Coinbase's 'sell' price.

It is, but it doesn't really need to be in my opinion. I don't have enough bitcoin to where my home will turn into a scene from Ocean's 11. I think the usefulness of an encrypted paper wallet is in the scenario where you come home to find your safe has been broken into. Now you have time to move your funds to a new wallet (with one of your other 2 backups) before the thief gets around to trying to crack your password (or, these days, before he even finds out what bitcoin is). Time delay and removing the 'crime of opportunity' aspect is why I love BIP0038 integration.

I completely agree, and will likely be switching to android as a result despite owning every iPhone thus far. However, telling someone on the go that they should get a new phone doesn't exactly get them excited about bitcoin. It seems like the main factor for ios app deletion is the ability to buy bitcoin with fiat in the app, something that a private-key importation app would not need to do. After all, blockchain.info already does this, and apple is allowing it, its just an insanely buggy app with crazy high transaction fees (especially when you're doing small value demonstrations).
tl;dr while apple does suck when it comes to bitcoin, I don't *think* that they would be a limiting factor in this case.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:57:19

This analogy is for people who are genuinely interested in the potential uses of bitcoin (i.e. not just speculation), but get stuck on this psychological price of $200 and think its 'too expensive' now for them to buy some to experiment with.

@_date: 2013-12-28 16:21:29
I disagree. Each material isn't infinite in quantity, but the number of materials possible is near infinite. There are 98 naturally occurring elements on earth. The limit isn't even 98^98 because there are a huge number of phases you can create with the same few elements. There are a ton of unique SiO2 phases. Another example is the insane number of steels there are. Someone deciding one composition and specific crystal structure of steel being the hot new store of value wouldn't make gold less valuable as long as people still believe gold is valuable.

How is keeping your private key written down in three places any different than keeping three copies of an encrypted paper wallet (ideally with flash drive copies as well.)

I suppose I should have mentioned that. Her iPhone is older. I have the 5 and she has the 4 (pretty sure it's the 4, I'd have to double check).

Everything else looks identical.

I completely agree. It's not their fault it hasn't been updated, it's Apple's.

Thats interesting you say that. I bought at $6, $12, $20, $50, $100, $200, and every time I'd mention buying more to someone, they'd say something along the lines of "X?

1) Fee of 0.0005 per transaction (every app should be down to 0.0001 by now in my opinion)
2) Bug where 'scan private key' button doesn't appear until you've archived an address. 
3) Bug where if you have many addresses, on the 'send' page it takes scrolling through them all 3 or 4 times before some of them will show up in the list for some reason. 
Having to explain bugs to someone new who wants to see how a bitcoin wallet works is a real turnoff.

@_date: 2013-12-16 18:21:45
Blockchain's app on iOS has a fixed .0005 fee. Hard to demonstrate to someone interested in bitcoin the benefits of low fees when they realize 40 cents goes missing each transaction. 1/5th of that isn't perfect, but 0.0001 still is much better. Also, when someone asks me about bitcoin, I like to take a paper wallet out of my pocket, fund it with some bitcoin and give it to them. If they ask me to show them how to spend it, I have to say "have an android phone?"

Nice to know. The ability to copy addresses you've already scanned to paste them elsewhere would be useful. I'll have to shoot them an email.
