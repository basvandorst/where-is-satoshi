This is super awesome. I rent a room most of every month, and would LOVE this. Done, and done.

Nono, I don't mean the 3rd party, I mean THE SITE itself. How do we know this is even a legit website??

Yea, I first heard about them THREE years ago, from a friend who now has over 300. At the time I had an extra desktop with a radeon 58XX series card in it, in a business I had just opened up. The kicker was I didn't need to pay for electricity there, so I could have had it up and running nonstop. But the user interface was hard to navigate, and I didn't like how bogged down my computer got, so I just kinda left it and forgot about it. Here we are now, 3 years later, BTC over $100 and I have .3 to my name. Really frustrating :(

Does that include litecoin?

It is for sure nice to have a bitcoin funded kickstarter kind of site, but how can we know you won't be taking the coins and disappearing? I can't find any information about the company, owners of the site, or really much at all in a google search besides the social media pages.

I don't mean to be rude, but there is a long history of people sending away bitcoins only to have them disappear into the sunset. If you really want to gain legitimacy you might want to figure out how to put safeguards in place via a 3rd party or something like that. Just my $.2.

Just saying "It's totally safe" isn't enough. Sorry, but I'm no more convinced at all. You need to DO more than just say it's safe. That's all I have to add to this, good luck.

Just because of his age?

You should really, REALLY consider MUCH more severe security measures.

Actually I would wager its a small minority of people who would want to scam him/PayPal, but a small minority of people on the internet is still A LOT of people.
