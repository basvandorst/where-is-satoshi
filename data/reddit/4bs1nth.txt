Thanks for clarifying the definition of a soft-fork, this way it makes sense.
I find this distinction between soft-fork and hard-fork confusing and at times misleading, but that's an entirely different discussion. Essentially, non-mining full nodes' rules are hacked (as in used for different purpose than intended) to propagate blocks that follow different rules than those non-mining full nodes' operators agreed to support.

@_date: 2015-12-23 15:51:54
If I understand the problem correctly, any solution to it (other than ignoring it) would turn SegWit from soft-fork into hard fork: none of the miners using older versions of the code will attempt to download the witness data.
Edit: although mentions "this is a soft fork" I don't see how a miner who doesn't know about the additional data (running old code) would be able to get his block accepted if mined on top of a SegWit block.

You must be rich knowing the future and all... I think there is potential for bitcoin mining becoming (barely) unprofitable as mining share also determins "vote" on network policy/ protocol changes. People with a high stake in the network might decide to run a farm simply to protect their wealth even it costs them more than the mined coins.

AFAIK using these services, taxes are paid first, and then all or a portion of the net salary is converted into bitcoin as requested by the employee. In this two-stage process, I don't see why it would be illegal to receive stocks, commodities, or blowstamps for that matter at the end of it.
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:02:41
I see several problems with that approach. Votes are supposed to be anonymous and secret among other things. That entails that nobody should be able to tie identity to each vote, yet distribute voting rights only to those who are eligible to participate. Guaranteeing that everyone can monitor results in real time while polls are still open is actually a problem and not a benefit. It opens up several ways of vote manipulation.

Affiliate programs like this might increase B2B transactions substantially. As mentioned before, they don't charge per transaction fees.

If it is publicly known that A is your wallet, B is your friends wallet, and that you and your friend are actually friends, then coin mixing alone doesn't help.

How does a deterministic change in block rewards increase investment uncertainty?
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:28:34


If the "problem" is that suddenly all miners flock to another crypto because it is  more profitable mining, or suddenly all miners turn their machines off because mining suddenly becomes unprofitable, it might be difficult to impossible from recover - and it will definitely push the price down.
You might notice the frequent use of the word "sudden" in my post. This sudden change is caused by halving block rewards from one block to the next and completely avoided with a smooth adjustment.

it would actually be much greater if there was something like the payment protocol for multisig functionality. This would need some standardized sign request for transactions, optionally with the private key that corresponds to a specific public address. It's currently a major limitation for multisig adoption IMHO that this doesn't work across wallet implementations. Correct me if I am wrong.

@_date: 2014-07-19 15:33:47
You are reducing economic shock to "abrupt change in price", which is a very limited view on economics. Think about miners who may anticipate that their business will be running at a loss from block X onwards, but still run it until block X-1 and may switch off their machines simultaneously. There is no economic advantage of switching your machine off earlier. Miners secure the network and I think an abrupt major change in hash-rate could have disastrous consequences.

This comes up regularly on this sub when some company X starts their own currency. The primary reason why companies start their own currencies or point systems is to increase cash flow.

* adoption: Bitcoin is the best known cc. Any business accepting any cc will start by accepting Bitcoin for that reason.
* security: the computing power behind mining BTC and securing the network is orders of magnitude higher.
* volatility: relatively speaking I would expect BTC to have lower volatility and higher liquidity than other cc's.
* trust: because BTC has a higher market capitalization and user base you can be more certain (relatively speaking) that BTC will be worth something in the future.
