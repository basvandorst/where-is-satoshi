Yes, there is a small sign you can press to change it to economy. 22sats/byte or something.
This will go through but it takes some time, up to 48hours in my experience

Thanks for the serious response...
I’m looking for someone to give me a balanced view.
I’m in agreement with your sentiments, I guess I just need some information about this mysterious LN that’s 18 months away (indefinitely?).
Sorry for my bad english.

Its not considered a currency for tax purposes as that is not its main usecase right now. 
Its considered a financial asset, on which you pay capital gains tax.

Thanks for the advice!
I use breadwallet at the moment.
I guess I’ll have to order a trezor or similar to be more in control.
Part of why I want to do this is to be able to spend my coins without having to pay capital gains tax for each purchase, not that I don’t like taxes it’s just a tremendous hassle.  
am I overthinking it?

For an idiot like myself, how can I store my coins in the easiest way to make sure I don't lose value during the November fork?
I'd prefer a solution that's purely mobile.
Or do I have to get a hardware wallet? How is that any different?
Eli5 please..
