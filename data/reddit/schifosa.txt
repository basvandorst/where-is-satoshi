You don't need an actual exchange with bitcoin. I can transfer money to you or any merchant without a third-party. you only need an exchange if you are trying to trade and make money.

the exchange rate is not good enough for me. .8 to 1 is only a 25% return against the risk of losing it all.

@_date: 2014-01-08 00:39:33

How did mark prove that he had over 400,000 coins after the hack in 2011?

They could have been acting like a dealer to try and make there market more efficient. Wall street used to have a dealer for each stock that would be the seller/buyer of last resort and was mandated to do so. This has changed since then but it could be mt gox trying to make their exchange seem like it had good liquidity and volume when it didnt.

Anyone else think the deadline is a little to far out? I mean this could all be over by then and the money could be more useful to him sooner imo.

fuck you OP. The paper wallets aren't meant to be redeemed right away. You should just tuck in a drawer and let it sit for a few years. It's about giving you an investment. Now maybe this guy went about it in the wrong way but by no means is that a bad gift. Stop being a stingy dick and worrying about getting your $20.

kinda seems like some sort of scam.. I'd beware

I agree with you but my point was that without that, it will be a while before bitcoin can be trustworthy and widely accepted. Everyday I see posts about people getting screwed over by some site. Despite what everyone wishes could be true, without some structure bitcoin will fail.

Virtual Bank of Earth, or Virtual World Bank. That way you can establish yourself as a world-wide leader, if that's what you want to be. Also, can you explain how this is different from a normal bank account if you are not actually dealing with our bitcoins directly? Will you basically be the middle man between us and exchanges and guarantee our transactions?

I think you've touched on the key issues that need to be worked out with Bitcoin. Without the backing of a government there is no one person or group that feels responsible for the growth of this currency. It feels like the wild west out here with exchanges getting hacked, sued or shut down every week. I think it will be some time before weak exchanges and virtual wallets get weeded out by the almighty Darwin.   
The problem right now with bitcoin is trust. People need to be able to trust exchanges and wallets and so forth before bitcoin can really take off. I think your right in that there needs to be some formal organization that sets up a secure, private, structure that can be depended on.
