"Clearing" is not a great word to use here. CBOE's clearing house will still be clearing these, settling the contract obligations and such. This is just one broker/maneger/dealer that won't be giving their clients access to the future.

Incorrect. Supply and demand of the future itself will ABSOLUTELY affect the underlying. Even with a cash-settled future, market participants will arbitrage gaps between the futures contracts and the Bitcoin exchange market.
Take for example, CME Globex's E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures (ES). They are cash settled just as the Bitcoin ones will be. Massive upsurges in ES price are near-immediately reflected in the underlying shares of the S&amp;P 500 index as market participants buy baskets of those companies.

They go on Schedule D as if they were any other capital asset. Additionally, to OP's question, if you purchase something with bitcoins, then you are disposing of your bitcoins at a gain or loss (using USD as base currency to determine value of the bitcoins disposed of).

Currently, the order book feed requires an access key. This is outside the norm for a Bitcoin exchange. Will it be this case going forward?
**UPDATE:** this has been fixed

Just checked, the price is still 1 Bitcoin.

Sounds like a Base64 encoding of a proprietary wallet format. A few wallets have used Base64 for backup files over the years. One of my first guesses would be Blockchain.info MyWallet. You might try passing the text through a trusted local base 64 decoder. Though, if it's encrypted, what you get out of that may be unreadable.
On macOS: `base64 -D -i "bitcoin wallet private key backup"`

Coinbase may have to buy that BCH in order to give it to you, at least for GDAX customers. See [this post](

Does it allow you to send Bitcoin to someone? Second layers are hot right now.

It's more like CME COMEX gold futures or CME Globex Soybean futures. Soybean farmers can enter sell-side of soybean futures if they're worried the price of soybeans will fall and they know their output will remain steady. Bitcoin miners that mine for USD profit can enter sell-side Bakkt futures that lock them in to sell their Bitcoin at a specific price if they think Bitcoin might go down in price.

It used to be more common. It doesn't take long with a modern GPU if all you care about are 4 or 5 consecutive characters and you don't care about case. The trick is getting to those characters in a non-deterministic way so that someone else can't use the same way to realize the same private key.

Yes. When a SegWit address (whether P2WPKH or P2SH-P2WPKH) has one of its outputs spent, the public key for the address is revealed by the spender. Same process as with non-segwit addresses.
The difference is that with segwit transactions, the public key is found in a different part of the transaction: the witness section instead of in the signature script of the inputs (`tx_witnesses` instead of `tx_in` in [the wiki for tx message format]( This witness section is also included in the blocks that settle the transactions, so the public key is archived indefinitely for the world to see.

While the address acts like a public key in its one-way spend-ability, it is not the cryptographic public key. In most cases, it contains a hash of the cryptographic public key.

This was a side effect of the ecdsa library bring used. It had about a 50% chance of using high-S per-input.
