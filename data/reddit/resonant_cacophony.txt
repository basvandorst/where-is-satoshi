have you tried looking to the right?

Let the speculation begin!

I was thinking about this the other day. What do you do when there is completely no electricity for a fixed amount of time? Let us say that there is completely nothing, not even personal solar. You can't use banking systems or bitcoin. How can you trade goods in such an occasion? Let us say that you have to use a money system, and not direct exchanging/swapping of goods. Well you would need some emergency fiat cash on hand, prepared ahead of time. What would the bitcoin equivalent be? Generating wallets with small amounts of btc, and printing out the private keys physically? I wonder how feasible such a system would be. How would you mathematically sign the pieces of paper to guarantee that they had that amount of btc?

Solid point. You have to consider more audiences.

Silk road played a huge part \- the first major commercial usage of bitcoin.

A lot of people brought up paper wallets. But they didn't highlight the beauty of putting coin onto a paper wallet, removing all other copies of the private keys, and then literally smoking away that bitcoin, making it never usable again. It's beautiful.

Nevermind, I just needed to change my scale to zoom out.
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:05:43
Awesome. How do you superimpose the charts like in the guide?
@_date: 2019-06-08 10:32:21
You are 100% correct ��

Market cap calculations in low liquidity markets are nonsense\*

I'm glad you have *gathered* a bit of bitcoin, since your car looks *magical*.

The kids are spending bitcoin to get high. Also, that food looks too nice, definitely a photoshop.

Out of all the weird explanations that people give for price movements on here, I was actually considering this...
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:39:24
I almost feel like bitcoin is being attacked by the amount of garbage that gets upvoted in this sub. Then I see the mods sticky an actually useful thread, so I get mixed feelings about that. Then I see that [Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism]( is linked in the sidebar, so I'm like wtf?

Vanguard broke the monopoly on finance.

Don't forget that the probability that bitcoin will succeed is somewhere between 0.0 and 1.0, but certainly not -1 or 17 or horse.

If you want diagnosing, you need to look for read/write bytes / sec on your blockchain drive. Are other processes also reading/writing from it? Also check CPU and Memory consumed by the process. All of these can be found in Task Manager / Performance Panel. If your Memory is 100% full, then you need to use a tool like process explorer to check your true hard faults / sec on your pagefile. Soft faults could be of relevance too, since your cache might not be getting utilized properly.

Most appropriate use of this meme that I've seen in a long time.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:08:08
But then there's fees.

Umm... lmao!

Great positive thinking OP
