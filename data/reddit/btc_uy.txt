Roger ver is a devoted to his ideals, he is not a judas. The guy can give his life for "libertarians" and "voluntaryism". He support Bitcoin Cash because he want to preserve the Satoshi whitepaper, he thinks Blockstream isn't a good idea because is a private company, and I understand, this company is backed and promoted for axa and Digital Currency Group, this group have his hands on more than 100 crypto-companies. If roger is bad or not, I prefer his possition. We are being divided, one side say to dont use bitcointalk and r/bitcoin and the other side say to don't use /btc or bitcoin.com This is getting worst each day

because r/bitcoin censure, and r/btc is the people in the correct side. maybe.
