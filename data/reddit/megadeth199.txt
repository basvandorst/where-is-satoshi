Good job to get 1 bitcoin. I was near that one day by mining but I kept it in mtgox and lost all. One day I will be back to 1 bitcoin :)

Bitcoin is realy volatile so it will go up and down and depending on the exhange also it could be different.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:45:07
Good luck man

Keep your coin you don't use in an offline wallet and only let your tipping coin with them.

Would be awesome but we need to get more people to bitcoin before that happen
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:22:05
will not down vote you for a tip. You could also tip on youtube and/or for good content.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:01:42
0 bits since I don't have any and I just started to read how it's work.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:08:06
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:45:03
Yeah it's the main driver. If people keep tipping, user will be back to post more things(good and bad).
@_date: 2014-11-08 18:44:31
oh what a lost of miner.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:41:36
Seems to be legit but don't invest everything there ... 
I have a zenminer but I think I will never get my ROI at this rate. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:40:12
Yeah propably and thanks for the tip
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:20:57
