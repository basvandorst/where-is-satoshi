Thank you!

What...that’s weird. I haven’t had any issues like that, only the long wait. That makes me really question them.

Yep! I started to seriously use Cash today after Coinbase took money out of my account earlier last week. I was hoping Cash wouldn't take so long.
I think technically Bitcoin is still in beta for Cash. I've had the Cash app and account for a few years or less after a friend told me about it but I never verified myself and all that until I started using it for Bitcoin. It might not be available to new users or they might be rolling it out slowly. Also, at the moment, there doesn't seem to be a way that you could send Bitcoin from Cash to another Cash account (like your friend) right now. I was reading about it on their FAQ.

I know you posted this a few days ago, but there is an option to deposit that on the side of the app. Once you open Cash, click that little person icon in the upper left hand corner of the screen or swipe from the left edge to the right of the screen. You should see your name and if you scroll down just a bit, you will see two spots for Cash and Bitcoin. Click the Bitcoin and there will be something at the bottom of the page that allows you to transfer the Bitcoin elsewhere. If you aren't verified yet (took me about 3 weeks to get verified), it will say so and tell you that you have to wait before it will allow you to transfer.
My only problem right now is that I sent over BTC to my Binance account and have been waiting about 30 minutes for it to clear. Still don't see anything and nothing on Blockchain which is weird. I have done successfully transfers before, though. I'm supposing today just might be congested.

Not at all, thank you for trying to clarify for me, though!

Sorry I never got back to you, this is my alt account. It took a few hours, as I’m sure you now know.
Definitely not a good way to do this when you really want to buy in at a particular moment.

Oh no, I know there's a difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (also heard of Bitcoin Gold). No, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the company Square has an app called Cash that allows you to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and that's where I purchased my Bitcoin from today.

Typical spam. Lots of accounts do this when they notice your account participating a lot in a single community. They think sending you spam that’s relevant to your interest will get you hooked to do whatever, join their sub, discord, etc.
