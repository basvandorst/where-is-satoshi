What does auto purchase intervals do?

Holy smokes! If either of those cases end up true, I better want to keep my holdings now and play things more by ear.
In your opinion, will people in 5 years turn around and wish that they bought Bitcoin today/had not sold what they had. I prefer to not live my life in regret haha

Holders? ��
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:14:32
The last thing I want is to be kicking myself down the road for stupid stuff. I'll scrape by now and hope my investments work out in the long run

Yes, nobody is clairvoyant. But from all of the research I have done, I believe that current trends will reverse. Cryptocurrency's potential has yet to be seen.

Haha that would be something. Are you serious though? I'm really considering option to sell but if that's a possibility I may find other ways to pay off my debts
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:19:55
That would be insane! I'm going to try to keep my holdings as long as I can.

I know that Bitcoin will skyrocket and I want more than anything to keep my investments. If that means taking up another job and working weekends to make ends meet, I will. After all, a little hard work never hurt aybody and I am certain it will be worth while in the end. Thanks for your help friend!

I appreciate the advice and if it comes down to it I may have to.

What platform do you use, and what's their rate charge?

Looking at the trends it certainly seems to be exponential at this point. But beyond that 12 month span, do you see market for cryptocurrency tapering off or continuing on this trend? I'm sure you know more than I do, so any advice is appreciated. I only invested initially bc it sounded like a cool concept and it's exciting to see Bitcoin doing well

Ohh okay. No need for link, thanks for letting me in on inside joke haha
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:19:59
Take a chill pill.

At what price to do think the big dipper will scoop up again?
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:41:13
Nobody is clairvoyant. Study they markets, the trends, the volumes, news articles, etc,. It's a lot of fun. But I'd say wait a few days until trends start to reverse. Only goes up from here.
