Normal newspaper "story finding" today. They rarely do something original when it comes to digging up the dirt. It's really bad, even people at papers are forgetting to be source critical these days.

That's really good news. Safello's been working really good for me in Sweden with payments over Swish that gives instant money transfer to receiver. 
Best of luck with the expansion.

I would donate the amount to  for their work on a Bitcoin Wallet for Windows Phone. They expect a release within 1-2 months according to the latest tweets made by the developer.

Still have to wait another 10 days 😐

Been buying some again just before the drop before new year, no regrets for that. But my strategy now is to wait for the price to flat out a little and invest again when the price is over 0% over 14 days. 
Good or bad idea?

My bad, I guess I meant that they ignore accuracy about details rather than forgetting. But people reading ignore looking up if things are correct, they just skim trough as you say. But I guess the one reading the most crap when they die wins.

There are several exchanges you can use for trading Bitcoin for fiat currency. I recommend these two that I use,Kraken.comSafello.comBest of luck in the hunt for lost treasures 😊

You can trade on an exchange.
or others

Since no block has been confirmed in 66 minutes the fee is increasing. Making the fee you made when you made the transaction lower than the ones making one now. It's a spiral that will increase until blocks are found. Give it time.

This has to be some kind of error, or is the demand of Bitcoins so high today?
You should sell to them and buy new ones for a lower price somewhere else :)

Well, as it looks now they stopped in preparation of making it possible to make more transactions per second. This will only get more interesting. They stopped at around 2pm CET and at 3.30pm they dispatched about 600 transactions in 30 minutes. You can see a big spike of transactions at that time on tradeblock.

Wrote about my concerns here about this, may be wrong.

The reason I didn't post a link to the page at first was because I didn't know if it was against the rules of this subreddit. It doesn't seem to be so. Also I more wanted your reflections on the situation, rather than about the site itself. But here is the site I think about: [

True 😃 Great background check by me today.

If this is true, it's bad. I can not confirm this.

Bitwhat? ;P

Only way this would work is if you can limit the webpage and services possible to use our enforce encryption over the connection. It's like sharing handwork over Tor, you'll get blamed for what happens on your service no matter what you say. You signed a contract with your ISP.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:09:26
Sharing bandwidth is good, but you will be liable for their actions on your signed service. It's the same reason I don't use Tor to share my bandwidth.

That's nice. Haven't heard about it. Didn't we use to have one with support for blockchain.info?

Great news for users on Microsoft Windows Phone platforms. :)
We can finally carry some coins with us on the go without having to use an online wallet system.
