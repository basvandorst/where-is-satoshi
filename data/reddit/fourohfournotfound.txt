Maybe he's holding them for everyone to help the bitcoin economy and when they are worth 10000$ each he's going to share the wealth with everyone! I love you mark? P. S.  I can't wait to go to your coffee shop! 100million on just the cups you're such a great businessman to have so much money!

I got the stat from another reddit post. Poor source I know regardless any significant taxes on remittances could drive people to bitcoin. My intention was not to bash trump and more of trying to share something that would drive many to bitcoin.

I have no problem with Russian people and would enjoy visiting there if I could afford it. I wouldn't have any problem going there as I am not important I'm just a regular person. Honestly I would have a hard time trusting a former spy officer as head of state for the American government. My opinion is definitely shaped by the possibly biased us media just as yours is shaped by the possibily biased Russian media. I am open to evidence proving otherwise if it's strong enough however.

I think that the point here is to inspire fear not prevent corruption. Think about how many people that have gone against Putin have wound up dead under strange circumstance. Now think about how they can use a publicly available record of how everyone voted. It seems like blockchain for evil not for good to me.
