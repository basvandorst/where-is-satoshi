Interesting. I saw that thread and noticed the same thing, was pretty obvious how the commenters were suddenly trying to spin a harmless photoshop into a vicious attack on Mark Karpeles. Seemed quite ridiculous to me.
I also noticed a sudden weird u-turn in the general attitude of this sub that coincided with the rise in price back towards 300 goxbux per goxcoin - first the whole sub seemed convinced that gox was certainly just about to implode, then like one day later there seemed to be dozens of highly upvoted threads and comments about how this was all fud and how gox would surely reactivate withdrawals soon. The same happened over at the bitcointalk forum.

It is completely unnecessary to demand js for reading a blog article. Displaying text and images is nothing that requires js. 
Also, this is I read threads on here every week about js related exploits that have caused people to lose their coins. And a site called "hackingdaily" doesn't really instill trust. And even if I did trust the site, having to whitelist each and every site I visit is an unnecessary waste of time, especially if I simply want to read an article.
It's also a problem for people who use tor, because js can reveal your true identity. 
Using noscript also helps to block out many of the annoying elements on a website, like videos that start playing automatically (with volume turned to 11 of course, while I am wearing headphones...).
Javascript should be optional, making it a requirement for reading simple text is imho impolite and makes me avoid that site in the future.

I have asked the same question here and on the bitcoin forum before. Sadly, I never received an answer.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:07:42
I don't understand how using p2pool will solve the problem. 
I see the problem as Ghash having a majority of the mining hardware (which is why they are in a position to 51%-attack). They will still have the majority of that hardware even if all their customers (and/or the rest of the miners) switch to p2pool. 
Either we assume that Ghash has no malicious intents - then it doesn't matter if they can perform a 51% attack anyways and so there is no need to switch pools. Or we assume they are malicious - then switching to p2pool will still leave them in a position to 51% attack, because in the end it is GHash's decision how they use their hardware, not the customer's.
Please correct me if I am wrong here, but the only solution I see is making sure that the majority of the mining hardware is in the hands of (optimally a multitude of) trustworthy mining operations?
Edit: I was wrong to assume that all the hashing power on GHash stems from cex.io. Thanks for pointing that out. So please switch to p2pool if you are still using your own equipment to mine on GHash. Although in my opinion this is only a short term solution, as the threat of a consolidation of the majority of the mining equipment towards one entity (like cex.io) still exists.

Possible solution (?) that is not software dependent: Crowdfunding of mining hardware producers and mining operations, which are by the people and for the people. 
The hardware producing entities sell the hardware to the mining operations at cost. The mining operations pay out a fair amount of their profits to the shareholders and reinvest just enough to always sustain a certain (low) percentage of the overall hashrate. New mining operations get continually created in a variety of different countries in case a government turns hostile to one operation. 
Endscenario: Hundreds of small scale mining operations all over the world which in total control far more than 51% of the hashrate - all of them operating completely in the open with no secrecy involved, always in the view of the public.

Maybe instead we should crowdsource an alternative mining operation that is completely public and controlled by the shareholders, with a directive to never have more than x% of the mining power? 
And once that % is reached a new operation gets funded in a similar fashion, which is independent of the first one and placed in a different country? 
And so on, until the majority of the hashing power is controlled by a multitude of such publically owned and independent mining operations placed all over the world?
Seems like a better alternative to me than having the majority of the mining hardware in the hands of a potentially malicious entity like Cex/GHash.

Now this is going to get linked in r/dogecoin, then a bunch of angry dogecoiners (who are totally not angry, because their coin is all about easygoing fun, Fun, FUN!!!) will come over, and then we have another dogedrama unfolding on the frontpage of r/bitcoin. I think some of your comics were really lulzy, but I downvoted this one. Please, no more dogedrama in this sub.
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:38:23
Well, I would think that the miners would still wander off as soon as they realise that s.th. odd is going on, and then choose a pool in a country/place where no such problem exist. It would certainly cause a lot of inconvenience though for a while, and would most likely crash the price, but not totally kill bitcoin. 
Now, one single malicious entity getting control of most of the hardware seems like a much more dire situation to me with no real remedy to it once it has happened, and would probably spell doom on bitcoin. All imho, of course.
@_date: 2014-02-05 14:18:09
I think it's just a matter of time before mass tipping of a few cents worth of doge goes from "funny novelty" to "annoying spam" for the majority of reddit users. I'm glad that the bitcoin tipping bot doesn't allow any tips below 20 cents.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:59:27
Personally, I wouldn't want to see the same kind of tipping culture they have in r/dogecoin here in r/bitcoin. Tipping small amounts back and forth between the users (in a kind of zero sum game, it seems) is fine over in r/dogecoin, because that's what their sub is all about. 
Doing the same thing here (and most other "serious" subs) would clutter up the threads with lots of completely irrelevant oneliners + verification messages by the bot*. I like how the average tip by the bitcoin bot is worth nearly 7 dollars; quality over quantity.
The folks here in r/bitcoin can actually be very generous, just look at how much was gifted to that woman from Botswana or to Dorian Nakamoto. And these people actually received life-changing amounts of money, not 25 cents with which you cannot even buy a pack of chewing gum. I prefer it this way.
Edit: * And I am pretty sure that's the reason why the tipbot was banned from a couple of subs.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:38:32
As usual with the Willy discussions, the China issue is completely disregarded. As far as I remember, the bubble popped after China "banned" bitcoin. So calling the top of the bubble did not require inside knowledge about bot trading activity - one simply had to follow the China news.
And just like I don't believe that Willy popped the bubble, I also seriously doubt that it was Willy who suddenly somehow made the Chinese buy massive amounts of bitcoins as the bubble got inflated. There is a reason it's usually referred to as "the China bubble", and not the "Willy bot bubble".
These revelations seem rather disappointing to me, but maybe I'm missing something.
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:40:17
Amen to that. A malicious pool will simply drive their miners away which leaves them without the necessary hashing power to carry out an attack - problem solved. But a single malicious entity with the majority of the mining hardware under its control - that's the real issue here. Imho.

Don't the Pachinko parlors in Japan have a problem with not being legally allowed to give out money as prices, so that instead you get a token that you carry to another store (which is not officially affiliated with the Pachinko place) where it gets exchanged to Yen? Maybe with Bitcoin they can get around such restrictions?
Edit: I found [this](






If they start to use Bitcoin instead, they could still use the old system to allow the customer to exchange for Yen immediately after winning, or the customer could just hold on to the BTC and exchange on his own accord whenever he likes.

Sounds good. But why does the system need to be centralized (controlled by OpenCoin)? Why do they not release the source code? Why does the system need XRP? Why not use Bitcoin, which are not under the sole control of Opencoin? 
Rigt now, we have to trust that OpenCoin will stick to their promise of not creating more XRP at will. We have to trust that they hand them out fairly, and not hold on to the vast majority of them and/or hand the majority of XRP out to their buddies and supporters. Why should I give them this trust? They claimed in the beginning that XRP were designed to never have significant worth, but right now they are traded for like 7000 XRP per BTC. This was obviousl not true, so that's just one reason not to trust them (and not the only one, imo).
I used to think that Ripple sounded like an awesome idea, but I am totally sketched out by Opencoin's execution of the system. Also, I (and obviously a lot of others) are getting the impression that OpenCoin is actively shilling for Ripple, here on Reddit, on bitcointalk and even at the conference. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:58:10
I made a transaction in Ripple and it was not .00001 XRP but 1 XRP. We could trust OpenCoin that the price for transaction will be reduced, just like we could trust them that XRP are created and distributed fairly, but why should I? I have no reason to trust this for-profit venture. They claimed that XRP were designed to never have significant value - they are traded for about 7000 XRP per BTC right now. And this obviousl false claim is imo just one reason not to trust them.
Also, you write about "open source code provided". It is not open source, why should I trust OpenCoin to make it open source one day? Because they say so? No, thanks.
Edit: Edit: User "fwaggle" showed me that the number I see is not correct. I do not understand why, but the real amount I paid as a fee is indeed 0.00001 XRP, but it is displayed as if it was 1 XRP.

I just logged into my Ripple account to check. I recieved 5000 XRP from the giveaway thread here: rphtXijsBLBRdSznHyeMF6Cp15nki3snp7. I sent 4950 to another user. I now have 49 XRP left. So 1 XRP disappeared, and I guess that this 1 XRP was the transaction fee. So either I am missing s.th., or the wiki is wrong.

The XRP currency is only part of Opencoin's version of Ripple. I think Open Transactions is developing a Ripple version without a mandatory, built in currency. 
To be honest, I think XRP deserve the top spot in your show - it is centrally controlled, non-opensource and 100% "premined" by Opencoin. The potential for scamming is huge, and since Opencoin is a for-profit venture, I have no reason to trust them to not use their position for their own (monetary) advantage. In one scenario, Opencoin could potentially sell off all their coins (for example because they expect a raid by authorities that will shut them down) and once they get shut down their XRP currency will vanish together with them  and will be completely worthless. 
There is a lot of discussion on bitcointalk about this at the moment, if you want to look further into it.

To me it seems like you are flip-flopping here. In some posts, you claim that XRP will be nearly worthless and will not/should not be used as currency. Then in other posts (like this one), you claim that OpenCoin will profit by "paying themselves with XRP"? I think you cannot have it both ways - either they are worthless and not useful as currency, or they have worth and will be used as currency. The latter is obviously already happening, I have exchanged XRP for BTC myself (and gave them all away to Bitcoin100, just in case you think I am a hypocrit for using XRP as currency even though I criticise the system).
Also, when I sent my XRP, the fee was 1 XRP. This is much higher than the amount you mentioned.

The discussions on bitcointalk about Ripple gave off the impression to me that it is a centralized system, in the way that when OpenCoin shuts down (for whatever reason, like being raided by authorities), the whole system will come down with them and will henceforth be useless.
Now I see claims in this thread that this is not the case, that Ripple is actually decentralized (and I assume that this means that Ripple is not dependant on the survival of the OpenCoin entity).
I am honestly interested which of both claims is true. Could anyone be so kind to clear this up for me?
@_date: 2013-05-25 07:32:50
So if Opencoin's Ripple becomes opensource, how are the transactions of XRP going to be secured if there is no mining and therefore no blockchain? Can someone give me a link that explains it?

I think that many of the verbal attacks I saw in the past days towards litecoin were imho way too harsh.
There is one thing about LTC though that has been bothering me which I have not seen adressed here: 
Litecoin's hashrate is somewhere between 35 and 45 Ghash/s right now (according to coinchoose.com). I calculated that a 51% attack could be possible with an investment of approximately $20,000 (for about 60 Radeon GPUs, which according to [this thread]( should give about 650 MH/s/card, with the cheapest offer being less than $280/card). 
$280 * 60 = 16,800 (+some other hardware (?), I don't know enough about mining hardware to quantify this, but I doubt that it would push the total costs significantly over $20,000)
This seems shockingly low to me. If this was true, litecoin is extremely insecure and only suitable to send/store pocket change at best. It could be attacked very easily by groups who do not wish to see LTC succeed. 
Can anyone point out to me if/where I made a mistake here?
**TL;DR:** I calculated that LTC is very insecure because of insufficient hashrate. Please point out the mistake in my calculations.
@_date: 2013-05-21 09:28:21
If I understand correctly, actually 100% of the XRP are premined. OpenCoin promised they will hold on to no more than 30% of them. They want us to trust them that the distribution of the 70% will be conducted in a fair manner.
Someone correct me if I am wrong, please.

The story is simply that some person attached 25,000$ worth of bitcoin as a fee to his transaction, probably by mistake. You cannot find the story by looking at the transaction, but there was a popular thread about it in some hours ago.
