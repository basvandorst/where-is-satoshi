Spammers are still having to pay a non-zero cost to spam. As long as there is some cost, either through fees or pow, then spamming should have built in dis-incentives

Satoshi had mentioned on forum posts that non zero fees were a way to de-incentivise spam since it would be too costly to go through with it. 
A better thought question is. What is spam? who gets to define what spam is? What if every transaction in the spam attacks we have been having was a legitimate non malicious and good-hearted transaction? 
Then blocks would still be getting filled. The 1mb limit was placed as a quick fix for the potential vulnerability that the young network might be exposed to. The older more mature network is the world's most powerful computing system. It can handle more

Is the mongodb rumors true? 
Because mongodb is not acid compliant and this has proven very detrimental to some old exchanges.

First off thanks for taking the initiative to do this. It is very cool to see teachers who engage students and try to make class fun. 
As for the bitcoin questions... 
I dont know how technical or how familiar you are with bitcoin. But the easiest way would be printing some paper wallets. Then loading them up and having them sweep the paper wallet using a phone app. 
You might want to consider starting out with mBTC to get people exited and accustomed to trading smaller amounts without it feeling like you are drowning in decimal places

Satoshi originally did not have a block size limit. 
He added it as a quick fix to the potential of a catastrophic network-wide dos attack. Back then the network was not large enough to handle larger blocks as it is now . 
Not to mention it was basically no cost to spam the network
