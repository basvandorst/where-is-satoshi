its either we have hobos or we have hobos. lets think of something that doesn't result in hobos
@_date: 2016-03-29 01:38:24
He never told me his name, but I knew for a fact that he had schizophrenia. He also could get a stroke at random and it was typically 100 degrees fahrenheit outside. He also did the nicest thing, even though he was a hobo scrambling for money, he gave a lot of his change he collected to a worker, in her tip jar. I would rather have him by my side than you, because unlike you, I sure as fuck may not believe what he believes, he dared to question my beliefs, rather than call me an idiot or a non believer.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:08:14
so either it's have hobos with a minimum wage, or have hobos without a minimum wage
we're both wrong here

then don't even, because you sound just as unintelligible as as a schizophrenic hobo. Actually, worse because at least I actually understood what he was saying without consulting google.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:28:04
Didn't that already happen
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:21:18
this doesn't seem like a good idea

I like to imagine that germany just found out about prostitution and is trying to cover it up with bitcoin

remove the shit so you can still live in the same house
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:04:11
I would do this, but I don't have any money or a job, so I can't necessarily get any bitcoins right now to test the wallets out. Plus it's volunteer work, not job work, and getting a job is my number 1 focus
