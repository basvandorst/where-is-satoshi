You can check your balance on any block explorer. Just paste the address into one and it should show you the Balance of your Address.
Good Block Explorer: blockchain.com

I usually use 1sat/byte. So my last transaction took like 70+h, but got confirmed anyway.
Im sure your Bitcoins won't be lost.

I usually send transactions with 1sat/byte and it works totally fine, but could take a few days to confirm.
A transaction could get stuck if you send it without any fee, but I don't know any wallet which allows sending transactions without a fee.

The wallet is just a tool to interact with the blockchain. It stores your private key and signs transaction with it.

We never seen a price drop of 16k in a day xD
BTC is volatile because its extremely small atm. 
For comparison: Amazon has 400 Billion $ MarketCap, BTC only 100 Billion $

1. You should get a hardware wallet (I can recommend Ledger and Trezor, ONLY BUY THEM FROM THEIR OFFICIAL WEBSITES!) 
2. Don't buy your Crypto all at once. Do little steps, maybe Invest 500-1000$ a Month to profit from cost Average. 
3. Do NOT leave the coins on any Exchange Website! Withdraw them to your Wallet!

Just paste the adress in any Block Explorer like Blockchain.com and check If the transaction has confirmations. Most Websites only accept transactions with 6+ confirmations. If your transaction has no confirmations yet, you had payed low transansaction fees and have to wait.

For little BTC balances u can use a software wallet or a paper wallet.
If you invest a bigger amount in Crypto u should get a hardware wallet. I can recommend Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets, if u buy one, make sure u get them from the official website - NEVER BUY THEM USED!

If the transaction in the Blockchain has some confirmations it should show up on the sit, if its not a scam.

There is no Bitcoin Core Coin. I think you mean Bitcoin (BTC).
There are no usernames in BTC, there are only adresses.
You can look up information about your BTC in Block Explorers like Blockchain.com

I think if its the official Ledger Account its ok. But i would prefer the official Website.

Cost Average is your friend.
