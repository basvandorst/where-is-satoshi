Sauce? I thought they were planning to ship this month! grrrrr
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:15:20
Yeah. Looks good, but I worry. 
At current dificulty and network strength the jalapeno should beable to return a decent little profit. However, Ive been informed I wont get my jalapeno until March/April,.. at that time the profitability may not be so high. 
@_date: 2013-01-28 21:38:33
Sounds good. Ill try to remember to come back and report. Thanks

Hey HeavySteve, 
Im in the same boat. Lemme know if you figure somthing out. In the mean time I have been thinking about simply transfering BTC to mtGox, trading on mtgox BTC-&gt;USD, USD-&gt;BTC then transfering btc back to canada and cashing out.
Although I think you are talking about playing the differences in price between mtgox and cavirtex. In which case, perhaps a USD enabled account would be the way to go.

cool. thanks

Would WD40 work on the drones as well as it does on wasps? 
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:27:31
yes, and imagine how few bit coins we would be mining individually......
@_date: 2013-01-28 20:41:19
I pre-ordered last week. I called them to ask when it would ship. They told me I could expect it later Feb to Mid March. 


Thanks. Me too. Every day that passes is a lost mining opurtunity. 
How about you? Have you or do you plan to preorder a ASIC miner? What company/unit? Why?
@_date: 2013-01-24 16:31:01
Thanks for mentioning localbitcoins.com; I hadnt heard of that. How do you ensure that you get your money or BTC when using that service? What sort of turnover rates do you endure?
@_date: 2013-02-08 20:10:08
Thanks for the suggestion! Bitmit seems to be a lot like eBay but with BTC. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 23:25:37
Totally. If I had a million to spend on BTC Id be considering how to make that work to my advantage. But I dont,.. so I wont. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 22:45:31
I think it is because the media is starting to report on bitcoin, more so now than in the past. Im guessing more people are getting interested and signing up.
@_date: 2013-01-28 18:10:36
Yeah, I get that fishy small from BL too. 
That said, I have preordered one BL's devices. I may have ordered an avalon device had they had an offering in my price range. 
Fingers Crossed!

hey hazekBTC, can you explain a bit about this chart?
@_date: 2013-02-08 16:26:09


Indeed. 
I have heard rbc offers a USD account. I may very well look into this. 
How will you calculate when to buy and when to sell? I have been attempting to do the buy low/sell high thing on cavirtex; I get hit with pretty high fees and have never been able to increase my initial investment in BTC much beyond $50 - $100. 
@_date: 2013-01-24 15:41:31
@_date: 2013-01-25 17:41:18
Correct me if Im wrong, but does increased network strength not equal more folks mining which equals less returns on mining?
@_date: 2013-02-08 20:08:42
Thanks for the suggestion. 
Coconut oil is quite a bit more expensive than olive (for the good stuff). We can (and somtimes do) make soap from Coconut, if we were to sell it, it would cost more than olive. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 22:45:49
great, thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:19:41
Thanks for that!
To clarify that I am reading your table properly:
At dificulity multipler = 10 and BTC /USD = $10
it will take you 137 days to pay off the little single? And at BTC/USD = $25 you would pay off the cost of the rig in 55 days?
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:16:09
Did they mention when you will be recieving you device?
@_date: 2013-02-08 22:57:28
Ive been eyeing bitmit.net more, it looks great. Do you know: Is there any way to see what items have sold/ are selling?
@_date: 2013-01-23 22:52:45
Maybe some large entity is playing with the market?
@_date: 2013-02-08 18:33:00
ah, cool. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 20:44:41
Great! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-01-31 15:59:12
BUTTERFLY LABS! C'MON, SHIP MY JALAPENO!!!! 
@_date: 2013-01-25 18:43:10
Thanks for the clarity. 
What do you think would be a better strategy for someone with a jalapeno, to solo mine or join a pool? In todays climate and in the future when many folks could have simmilar or better devices?
@_date: 2013-01-24 20:26:07
Yes, Ive been noticing cavertex fees do put quite a damper on the fun im trying to have trading small amounts of BTC. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 21:24:15
BTC are in the mail!
Edit: wait. What is this? Are you tipping me or asking me to tip you?
@_date: 2013-02-01 15:23:34
I am open to this possibility. No doubt it was a risk to pre-order from BL. WIthout risk, how can there be any gainz, bro?
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:59:01
Yes, the fees are a serious pain in the fun. 
Wait, did you say you got an upright for $200? Where are you shopping?!
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:26:49
Yeah, thats what I got too. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 15:24:37
I hear you. I guess we are looking at this week or next for shipping at the earliest. . . I think that was the last I heard.
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:04:22


Yeah, good point. 
Thanks for the info. Maybe I shoulda saved up for one of the avalon rigs. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 15:21:41
Thanks DoubleDick! I was unaware of that sub!
