I want to but I don’t know the market and I’m just asking if this is the right time

Nope just high traffic

I did my first transaction 2 days ago at 6300 euro, lost 50 already, am I going to lose more or not?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:25:56
Personally I’d wait for the correction and buy at a lower price

High traffic probably
