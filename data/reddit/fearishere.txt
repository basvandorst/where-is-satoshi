Mate it has risen $100 in the last 48 seconds. 
It is already back at 17500.
E: make that 17600.

Well, that wasn't said anywhere besides the OP's misleading title. 
They get 100k accounts OPENED, surely not verified daily.
I'm personally waiting for almost a month...

I've been waiting for 10 days for Bitstamp to verify my account. It's painful at this point.

Pretty much same yea, held by the same company.
Also their price is the price of the last completed trade on their exchange, while the others use some other price which I don't know how is calculated.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:34
Sure, that'll be 19250$.
E: make that 19400$

I've been waiting for bitstamp verification for half a month.
In the meantime I put some money in through a local exchange.

If you want to buy at this price, don't wait for Bitstamp verification, I've been waiting for almost a month now.

I bought some coin bout an hour ago, thinking I was too late to hop on after waiting for verification on coinbase or bitstamp.
And here I am now, having earned my daily pay already!

Don't need an exchange if you hodl :\^)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:15
Has been like that for hours now, if not more.
However tx's per second more than doubled from ~3.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:33
Calm your tits. And don't invest money you can't afford to lose. 
Hodl on.

I just read this as: PULL OUT THE SAVINGS AND BUY MORE

$16k ��

What? Just buy back into BTC when you want fiat, and sell that off to an exchange/person.

As others have already said, you can buy parts of a bitcoin, just the same way you can acquire cents, and not just whole dollars.
