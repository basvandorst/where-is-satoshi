That's where you're wrong, kiddo.
You're ignorant about how mining works, and that undermines the credibility of your prediction.

I tried to sell into USDT to sideline my cash during the last flash crash so I could buy the bottom. Timed it wrong.
This time I said 'fuck it' and am hodling.... and also buying the dip with a locked in price of like $12.3K from Coinbase.
So ideally in a few days the dip is over and I'm brilliant.
