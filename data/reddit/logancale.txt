I'm using DiabloMiner on two MacBook Pros with 
I'm not sure if there are better pools, having just started a few hours ago…

Yes, gold plays a substantial role in *Cryptonomicon* and *The Baroque Cycle*, and the cryptocurrency was intended to be backed by it.

I certainly wish I had learned about them a year or two ago, but I don't hate myself for not having done so. That's pointless. Anyway, I like it for more than its past and current get-rich-quick nature.

Yeah, I ran my two GPU mining-capable computers overnight and made about 0.02 bitcoins... so I'm not continuing that. Still love the idea of Bitcoins, but I'll participate in the economy and community in other ways.

You can get a small, fractional amount from  for free. You can try GPU mining in a pool, but unless you have powerful hardware, you probably won't make much there.

I always hear great things about USAA, and I'm planning on switching to them soon. Despite popular belief, their checking and saving accounts are available to anyone, not just members of the armed forces.

I fear people in positions of power with little understanding of technology. People *can* use bitcoins to commit crimes, and those people should be targeted by law enforcement. (Whether the crimes *should be* crimes is a separate issue. Law enforcement enforces the law as it is currently.) However, just because someone uses something to commit a crime does not mean that that thing should be made illegal, especially when so many more people using it are upstanding individuals not doing anything wrong—in this case, just investing or using it to facilitate trade of legal goods.
Just because the existence of something makes it difficult for law enforcement to track down criminals does not mean it should be made illegal. Unfortunately, U.S. law enforcement agencies seem to disagree lately—they're trying to make real encryption illegal in the U.S., too, because it makes it too hard for them to spy on people, so it's not that surprising that they might want this made illegal.
I don't know what the right move might be in changing their mind. Publicizing all the legitimate ways bitcoin can be used seems like it might be beneficial.
The way it's headed, however, it seems like they want to flag anyone attempting to buy or sell bitcoins as being involved in drug trafficking, which is absurd and is likely going to lead to a lot of legal problems for completely innocent people.

I'm getting 6 to 7 mhashes/sec with DiabloMiner on my early-2010 MBP and a little over 4 on my 3+ year old MBP, both nvidia. I could get even better on my newer MBP, but it would also... freeze my interface.

I keep seeing [ClearCoin]( mentioned.

And that's a crime. Currency or not, it's property, and property is protected by law. (Of course, theft of low value property has little chance of police caring much, most of the time…) People have been successfully prosecuted for in-game theft.

For those who haven't read *Cryptonomicon* by Stephenson, cryptocurrency is one of its subjects as well, and it's an awesome book.

[DiabloMiner]( seems to work well.

I stand corrected—I believe the articles I read about it being treated as property theft were from a different country, perhaps China. Ironic if that's the case.
