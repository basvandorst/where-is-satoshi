Leave now or risk crashing the value of those coins you have worked so hard for.

I like how you talk about it like it were decades ago.

They are talking about a peer distributed website. Tor Hidden Services were just normal websites where the IP is hidden...

Basically, it is a race to see who can solve the problem first and whoever does gets to create the next block in the blockchain. Obviously, if p2pool has 50% of the hashing power and the rest is divided among regular pools then the odds of someone being able to double spend are extremely low. However, if the hashing power is between p2pool and some other pool with 50% of the hashing power then we would have a problem.

What do you mean by, "this action?" Are you speaking of reddit/the internet working to get people off of Ghash.IO? If that is the case then yes. However, I can't say bitcoin would lose all legitimacy but it would have little to no advantage over a centralized currency as you would have to "trust" whoever controls that much hashing power. Beyond double spending if they controlled even more than 51% they could indefinitely block transaction from ever getting included in the blockchain.

OP, can you post a list of apps on your phone?
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:05:46
This needs to reach the front page of reddit!

I didn't see any which pointed out that merely switching pools is not a long term solution.

Yeah, Neo and Bee was a bad investment. 10 minutes after I invested I realized it was a bad idea but decided to hang on to them to see what happens since I had bought in so early. When I finally decided to sell havlock locked the trading... The second trading resumes the value crashes to almost zero... =(

The database problem I am talking about is not merely one of privacy. Someone reading another user's data would be bad but a site like the silk road could still work if that were the only problem. It is more about verifying who owns what data within a database so that other users can't just over write their data. The system the pirate bay is talking about implementing would only allow the domain owner to modify a database/files. Would work well for static sites like the pirate bay.
If you allowed write access to anyone, a user can simply modify another user's listing and change the price to be free on the silk road. A whole new database system has to be designed with user permissions and cryptographic verification. It won't be an easy task and is likely a couple years down the road. It will happen eventually though. I am very sure.
When that day comes the world will forever change. You would be able to sell and host anything. No one could take down the site and tracing users would be extremely hard or impossible. Think human trafficking, hard core drugs, organ trafficking, and any other fuck up thing you can imagine. Will be truly a free market with really good effects and very bad ones...
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:12:34
They are just going to use private and public bitcoin keys to verify ownership of a domain the same way bitcoin transactions are processed. I suppose when you verify an account it just updates the time stamp on all peers for that domain. If the time stamp is older than a year, the peers will delete it. Someone else can then register the domain.
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:31:59
Great! The community needed this!

Next you open shop in North Carolina. The Research Triangle Park is where you want to be!

No, this was clearly an email hack not dropbox. Or perhaps it was someone sniffing his wifi. You see where this line of blind accusations is taking us? None of us know how this occurred not even the OP but the one thing we do know is that someone exploited a security loophole(hacked) at some level and stole the dude's bitcoins.
If there is something we all can learn from this, it is not that we should stop using windows, dropbox, email or wifi. It is that we need to be secure no matter what platform we use.
However, I will say it is a lot easier to secure a linux system but if you work hard enough it is possible to have the same level security on windows. It won't really be windows when you are done with it but still..
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:02:17
The only logical solution I can think of would be to charge the user for each domain they renew. Maybe have the user send bitcoins to a public key and the bitcoin transactions will be monitored by a bot which returns a private key for their domain? They may just have the users fill in a captcha which will suck because all good domains will be taken within days and squatters will sell them for hundreds of dollars...
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:52:36
Actually, though this is a start to true peer distributed web sites it is missing the factor of a peer driven database. You can host the database locally but writing to the database would not be shared with peers. So in fact the silk road or any database driven website would not work on peer hosted sites.
What needs to happen is write queries should have user permissions and encrypted columns. The user would have to log into the site to access their private data from the database which would be decrypted with their private key. This is something that I have actually been putting a great deal of thought into.
I was going to create my own peer distributed website service but realized that there were too many parts which needed to be developed before it would be useful. However, now that the priatebay is working on this part all that is left is the peer driven database engine!
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:02:52
It sounds like a solid design to me. I just said a bot because I needed to go to bed and all I knew was that they would need to make users pay for the domains one way or another to prevent squatting.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:26:43
Personally, I would be more than willing to accept the risk as long as you make it clear that returns will be in the current usd value. It is better to offer a service that has some risk for the customer than to not offer the service at all.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:26:41
That is because you are subscribed to r/bitcoin... Log out of your account and look again.

Are you too stupid to get sarcasm? They were joking you witless zealot...
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:00:01
Yeah, bitcoin would probably fall to 100th of its current value. Would still be usable like alt coins but people would probably move to litecoin or something else.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:17:16
Would have made a lot more sense to link to your site instead of just a logo on imgur.
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:04:30
I was working on this too. I was writing a daemon that used dnsmasq to redirect domains, namecoin to verify ownership of domains, and apache virtual hosts. Scrap that idea. I guess it is time to start working on a peer distributed database system instead.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:42:52
Yes, how it should have been from the start. Now you just need more models.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:23:02
I care little about GHash.IO going down to 30%. What I care more about is P2Pool reaching 2%! Which is twice as much as it was yesterday!

Someone make a package for arch.

You can install the gps app on your phone from home and track it. This is as long as the thief has data network mode on. At least give it a shot.

I signed up today but my .edu was no good. Does this mean if you do add my .edu, I won't be able to get the $10 in bitcoin now?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:10:30
Or we could make every post on the front page of about p2pool instead of just GHash.IO and actually fix this problem...
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:53:08
I see no logical reason to have two sites that are almost identical...
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:07:10
We have a package for it on arch.

How did you get so many bitcoins in the first place?
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:23:11
I will certainly use your service. I tried [receive-sms]( before. They took my money and the service didn't work at all. I tried contacting them but they never replied...
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:21:13
Not really a fan of the site's GUI. The buttons on the left that pop open when you mouse over them are kind of annoying. Also considering that only two channels are online at the moment I feel like recordings of previous streams that can be viewed on demand would be beneficial to both the cam girls and the users. Other than that I can see you put a lot of work into the site.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:40:58
Any chance you would be interested in hiring a web developer? I had actually written an entire [adult streaming site]( similar to this site about a year ago but I honestly had no idea how to find cam girls and ended up abandoning the project. I probably have some of the source code sitting around on my computer. This is something I would be very interested in working on.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:40:46
They are just wrong. Don't take it personal.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:56:33
I was thinking about replacing my bank with bitcoin. Why would you worry about it becoming illegal? The decentralized nature of bitcoin means they can't seize your bitcoins without your private key... They can however seize the funds in your bank, okcoin, bitstamp or coinjar accounts...
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:59:45
That's pretty lame if that is the case. Did you try following the transactions from the address you originally deposited your bitcoins into?
EDIT: Tried it out and it doesn't seem that the address reflects transaction on your account. However, I was able to check the balance over the phone app.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:29:49
Single point of failure.
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:09:51
Could you tell me a bit more about your experience?
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:24:26
Can't you just look at the bitcoin address associated with the card to get the balance? Obviously that won't really tell you transaction history. The 6 digit pin sounds like a serious flaw though. I guess you would have to charge it as credit.
@_date: 2015-02-17 00:02:57
Why not convert your BTC to BitUSD and convert them back when you want to spend them? Also couldn't you use a AMX debit card?
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:07:25
In what capacity?
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:07:15
Don't you think that if we were talking about the entire world, 7 transaction a second would be incredibly low? I would say more like 700 a second seems more realistic. Maybe more.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:08:52
It seems some what ridiculous now. I have to leave it running a couple days to download the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:12:28
Maybe but as of yet it is not out pacing the growth of the blockchain. It could after optimizations but it still seems somewhat optimistic.
