maybe it's the title. i would have called it "Pocket Bitcoin ATM, should I follow up on this?" ;)
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:42:38
..has 37 coins, all nickels and dimes. the value of the 37 coins is $3.10. how many dimes does he have? :)
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:00:12
congrats,  :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:41:02
should i follow up on this? is it something the world needs? :) it was a spontaneous idea when i saw that mobile card reader sitting on my desk at the hackathon :)
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:43:26

@_date: 2015-07-03 05:49:10
i was jumping around the room (literally), when i read the "confidential" email telling me that [SatoshiPay]( made 2nd. :) thanks for this great hackathon, guys!

"barclays starting to bank bitcoin businesses" is the one i'm waiting for..
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:53:42
good stuff! what about fees to get coin in and out of lightning? high, because of complex i.e. large transactions? how often do they occur?
@_date: 2016-02-07 08:22:58
we are aware. :) see my reply to this.
@_date: 2016-02-07 08:14:59
we will most likely not open-source the whole thing, but some components. in fact, we already started with it. see: 
the need for us to open-source our back end is not really there, because we can only really send funds around when the client signs their part of the bitcoin transaction. see florian's post on how we use smart contracts: 
we collect no personal data on the end users (readers), so even if "the regulators" get hold of our database, they won't know who content purchases belong to.
@_date: 2016-02-07 08:24:28
that's how we see it, too.
@_date: 2016-02-07 08:21:52
this, erm, is a little embarrassing.. ;)
the reason for this is actually a feature. we let the provider decide on the level of content security. on satoshipay.io we chose "none", meaning content can be retrieved by just knowing its location. the wordpress plugin however will only accept the correct pre-shared secret (which you buy) before it ships content. and we are working on the 3rd and most secure level, which are payment certificates signed by the client and the payment server.
@_date: 2016-02-07 08:33:19
i feel ya. we only really snuck that feature in there, because hey we can. :) kudos to f*ckadblock btw.! we'll see how people react to this and tweak depending on feedback.
just wondering, what would you do if one day 80% of your visitors use an ad blocker? that's where it's heading if i look at the stats.

hi there, this is meinhard benn, founder of satoshipay. ama!
@_date: 2015-09-07 13:27:19
a word of warning on satoshibox: i tested their service today and it overcharged me on fees. in their terms ( they state 100% payout, but i only received 50%.
i added a file, set the price to the minimum (0.001 btc, ~2 eur), opened another browser session, paid for the file and received 0.0005 btc payout to the address given in the upload form. that's ~1 eur in fees. :(
payment: 
payout: 
the download worked fine, but the whole things smells a bit scammy to me. also the site says "copyright 2013" at the bottom, so i assume it's no longer maintained.

the underlying tech is bitcoin payment channels. we built an api and a rich javascript client including an instant wallet around it and voilà, satoshipay! :)
@_date: 2015-09-23 12:03:16
in fact, paypal already has a micropayment offering ( - uk only), but its fee structure is not suitable for selling tiny digital goods, let alone increments of it. in addition to handling nanopayments we add value by establishing a zero-friction content payment network through an easy-to-implement website widget.
@_date: 2015-09-22 07:17:43
yes, they can be. there is no real definition of micropayments, but for instance visa and paypal define everything below 10 usd/eur a micropayment. so a payment worth 1c is 1000x smaller. with satoshipay you can transfer single satoshis -hence the name- as long as one "session" of many nanopayments reaches the dust limit.
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:29:32
here it is: 
@_date: 2015-03-26 09:28:05
go, radko, go! :)

seems legit. i'm the founder of satoshipay. ama!
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:15:30
so, did we win yet?
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:52:15
yes, that's the idea. credit cards for top up, crypto between devices and payout in fiat if desired. although your self-driving car probably has better use for cryptos. ;) a browser auto-paying to a website while you scroll down a page is already an internet of thingies payment.
outside the web, iot nanopayments are largely a solution looking for a problem at this point. an interesting field that keeps coming up is energy in all forms. sensor markets as discussed by 21 are another. parking infrastructure, public transport, telecommunication - the possibilities are endless!
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:10:14
our bitcoin solution is live, check it out on 
linking visa cards will most likely be available at the end of the proof-of-concept. dates are still tbd.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:38:54
how micro: technically you can charge 1 satoshi for a single digital good via our api if you like. as long as the user spends in total more than the dust limit during a payment channel lifetime (currently set to 24h), you have a good chance actually being paid out such small amounts. obviously a single satoshi is no meaningful price for anything. we suggest to charge a minimum of 1000 satoshis for stuff.
paying people: we have not identified partners for this yet. also we still need to do some work to get bi-directional/duplex payment channels running. however, simple non-channel payments for large(ish) amounts like 50c are already possible by sending funds directly to the satoshipay wallet address.
bi-directional payment focus: this can create very interesting dynamics on the web, where sites could buy some user data from you or pay you for doing micro-work. to enable this is one of our next milestones. iot payments will be explored together with visa. it may be light bulbs, or something else. we haven't settled on a concrete use case yet.
tldr: current focus for production use is on web nanopayments, iot is exploratory at this point.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:40:32
we sure do.
