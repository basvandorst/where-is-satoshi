I think all this illustrates is one of the fundamental problems with 'internet cash', and precisely *why* Bitcoin is 1) currently NOT ready for mainstream and 2) *needs* regulation.
If you had used actual USD you could/would have legal recourse. But since Bitcoin is currently *not* regulated, these people are under no legal obligation to return the money.
Now think of this: You are a frequenter of You own[ed] *at least* 30 BTC--and even YOU made a silly mistake that cost you a lot of money. What about average Joe consumer who can barely keep his checkbook balanced? This is more than $12k lost because of what amounts to a type-o. 
It sucks that you weren't more careful (seriously I don't even send .01 BTC without triple checking the address), but human beings don't all have the same moral prerogatives as you.

Donating his bitcoins is unnecessary. The merit of bitcoin is not founded on the supposed virtues of its creator but of its technological capabilities. The gears are already spinning, and the identity of the creator is now irrelevant.
Nevertheless I agree with you: Satoshi should remain anonymous; a faceless ideal which represents the economic utopia we strive for.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:03:34
Well, no. Him wanting to make it anonymous only has to do with the particular context of this incident.
OP sent it to the wrong address--which anyone could do. And just like what is happening here, the recipient is under no obligation to return those lost funds.

*Proving* a contract. BTC can do nothing (as of yet) to enforce both parties to comply with the terms of a contract (the government usually does that should one party decide to go rogue on the T&amp;C). 
And yet how does that have anything to do with OP's situation? He accidentally sent a lot of money to a wrong address--and the recipient has no legal obligation whatsoever to return it. Not only is there no *way* of enforcing any kind of refund, there's also *no one* to do it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:02:18
Ok, i see your point. 


I don't see how OP's situation was a scam, though. OP irreversibly sent BTC to an address he didn't intend to. The recipient is under no obligation to send it back. How would this problem be solved with ScriptPubKey and ScriptSig (or something similar)?
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:33:03
Because the whole world is so far behind on bitcoin. People just aren't using it. And most of the people that do 'use' it--are holding it as an investment.

so...a debit is 7 days faster than a direct deposit. Why?
@_date: 2016-03-23 09:56:25


I just keep my eyes open.

If that is the case, then bitcoiners are such a small minority that the technology may as well be considered 'dead'--but for real this time.
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:39:36


You are the member of an extremely small minority [bitcoiners who use it for day-to-day] of an extremely small minority [bitcoiners].

Bitcoin Computer Network? So basically Ethereum?
Or could someone explain the difference to me?
@_date: 2016-03-21 13:01:02


Not in any significant numbers. Even in Tropicana, Florida, home of the Bitcoin Bowl and unofficial Bitcoin Capital, people aren't even using it anymore....and even when people *did* use it, the percentages were small.


Okay, fair enough. Kind of like how 8-tracks will only be 'dead' when all of the 8-track tapes and players are destroyed.

It's been a pretty long "pause" since Nov 2013.

So if I understand correctly, a "bitcoin" is a numeric code combined with an address. Is that correct?
So when a 'bitcoin' is first mined, it's immediately coupled with an address (the miner's) representing that amount of Bitcoin.
Let's say I mine 1 bitcoin. That bitcoin is awarded to my address and so it exists only as a bit of code + my address. But let's say I only want to spend .01 of that Bitcoin. Surely that .01 btc can't have the same code as my 1btc. How does the blockchain know that this 'new' code is only representative of a single .01btc? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:33:08
So let my try to make sure i get this. My original 1 btc has a certain code tied to it, as issued from the blockchain &amp; combined with my address. I sent .01btc to a friend, it passes through the blockchain and the blockchain can recognize that particular code now as a new sum of .01btc.
What happens to my other .99btc? It stayed in my wallet and so, presumably, that code didn’t change. When I choose to spend it, how will the blockchain recognize that it’s .99btc I’m sending and not the 1btc that was originally tied to that code?
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:00:45
So every transaction is intermediated through the blockchain?
Let me see if I understand this. I have 1btc. This btc exists as a numeric code + my address. The code was assigned from the blockchain when mined and sent to my address.
Now I only want to spend .01btc. I send the code identifying my .01btc to the recipient, but it passes through the blockchain--registering that new code as the value of .01btc. 
But what about my remaining .99btc? Although the wallet address remains the same, it presumably has a different code than my original 1btc...a code that identifies it as .99btc. However it hasn't moved from my wallet. So how does the blockchain know that the representative value i have that remains is merely .99btc and NOT 1btc?

The only thing these comments illustrate is the person's fundamental ignorance of the concept of "value".
@_date: 2015-11-11 07:53:10
Ok, so every time a 'bitcoin' is transacted, it goes into the blockchain and then comes out again as a *new* output representing the combined value of the inputs (which were previously outputs)? 
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:51:53


So what is a bitcoin exactly? (ELI5, please)
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:49:25
Thank you so much. So few people seem to be able to explain this in such simple terms. You ask "what is a bitcoin" and everyone gets hung up explaining for 20 minutes listing the features of bitcoin and what it can do. They don't actually tell me what a bitcoin is (besides a 'store of value').
