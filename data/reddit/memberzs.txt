I solo mined a block back when CPU mining was a thing. At the time I thought bitcoin was just an experiment it proof of concept and it quickly left my mind. I formatted and installed a new OS on that hard drive not thinking anything would ever come off bit coin.  Boy was I wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:08:44
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:09
Yeah I paid what ever the fee was at the beginning of the year to get mine off an exchange I stupidly kept it on for far too long.

Can I use the seed from one wallet to transfer my coin to a new wallet? Or is it wallet specific? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:38:33
If I cashed out now. I could get a 2 for 20 at Applebee’s with my girlfriend.  In March when I moved it to his wallet I couldn’t buy a soda.  I think hodl a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:06
Man nothing like the don’t use your bitcoin until x tech is implemented.  Some people actually want to be able to use it now
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:16:27
That was my initial thought. A higher number on new machines mining compared to the normal addition of machines though out the year.

Honestly I'd imagine it uses the same bits of code. And that is possible have a limited release to the hotels partnering with the release and then open at launch or shortly after.

To be fair that's a shitty looking booth I wouldn't look twice at anyway.

Yes but information your not authorized to have access to, where as bitcoin or email I'm intentionally sending or receiving the information to/from you
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:36:08
If it came down to it, couldn't we just we are exchanging information similarly to sending  an email which would mean either don't tax bitcoin or tax every bit of data transferred over the internet?
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:10:24
I think they said it'll be a year after release once they do open it for devs
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:15:08

They are the best choice in my area so while the service it's self sucks the actual customer service is pretty great here. But it's also brighthouse/twc which may make a difference.

It’s still a change counter also with an option to also buy btc.  
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:26:59
first of all how do you even get a negative balance on venmo.  
Second of all good for them for sending those people to collections. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:48:35
I mean I sold a drill press with a bank transfer due to the amount. Aside from driving two minutes two the bank we were in an out in 5 minutes.  It still would have been faster with bitcoin but if it’s not an option look at the car and just settle on a time to meet at the bank. Have all your info and call it good.  Plus with PayPal fees. Who would do that for a large purchase 
@_date: 2018-10-26 22:51:39
It’s an electronic process they can patent it. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:52:50
No still returning to normalized levels.

It’s called a software patent they are all over.

Yep. I was one that learned from others mistakes and moved to my own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:12:35
I did also,  I was young didn't think bitcoin would become anything and was just a proof of concept.  That computer then got formatted and reinstalled a couple times, finally died and was sent to be recycled.  If I still had it I could have bought a house today. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:35:09
Which is still thousands of years.  It was used as currency b fire the romans were making coins from it. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:49:38
It literally doesn’t require printing more money it only requires corporations to not post record breaking profits every year.  Companies shouldn’t make billions in profits and pay zero in taxes.    Either pay the government so they can pay the people, or pay your employees so they don’t have to collect from social welfare programs and work multiple jobs.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:24:04
Yes so gold has been a store of value for thousands of years which your comment say otherwise .

@_date: 2019-08-08 16:19:29
Except the plan for that includes a vat like tax to pay for it.
And I mention minimum wage not the freedom dividend.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:01:12
You can have a livable minimum wage and not print excess currency. 
You counter inflation with scarcity.  Isnt that the whole point of bitcoin aside from the block chain ledger?
@_date: 2015-08-29 19:33:15
Yes an teaching them how to receive bitcoins to fund their international shitfest is amount things that should be illegal. It's the same as teaching them to buy guns from the armoury, you are providing them with a way to continue their torment on civilisation. The fact the kid taught then how to use bitcoin is just a anti bitcoin jab by the government and the media.

They aren’t fakes they are real diamonds, just not natural. The crystal structure and chemical composition are the same. The current debeers damage control team is saying diamonds with flaws are superior because that how you know they are “real”.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:57:39
I feel like the same idea as applies to bitcoin applies here.   If it’s not in a wallet in your possession, it’s not your money.

Coin base has been compromised for quite some time.  I constantly get emails asking me to authorize android or iOS devices to my account.  I have friend contacting them about it and got no response.  I have no private details about other than the one email address, no coins stored with them not ever have, just made an account when I was starting into bitcoin for the second time to maybe utilize the site.  As far as I’m concerned the entire site itself is just data mining to steal people’s coin.  Never will they get anything more than the email verification I did to open my account.

If an undercover agent asks if you want to buy some weed, it’s not entrapment.  If an undercover agent asks if you want to buy some murder it’s the same thing.   
Entrapment would be police routing traffic through part of a field to bypass a major wreck on a tow lane road, then arresting you for trespassing in that field.    Or a underage prom sting sending you unsolicited child porn and you getting arrested for possession of it.    Pretty much If you are making a conscious decision in the outcome of the offer it’s not entrapment.

Sounds like both the banks and the business are terrible and shouldn’t be in business then.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:17:40
Plenty of businesses run with out the need for loans.  I have friends that run businesses in niche markets that do just fine without loans.  Others are have been trying to price themselves out of business so they can retire early, but certainly accept the business they get at a much higher profit now.  
If your business requires loans to even stay afloat you are a terrible business person.

I understand there are easier ways I was simply giving an example of a possible use.   I'm sure home automation really b isn't a good use for that but it was the topic I replied to and kept on the topic. 
Hell a better use b for it would be set up a second home wireless similar to a hotel were people login in and pay to get a user name and pass word.  Hell set the price at $.10 equivalent daily per user. And accept bitcoin only. If you live in a city you  could potentially make a few bucks a month.   From what I understand about this device is it's  simply a raspi with a few extras that allow out to mine and sync with the block chain.  And it's meant more for businesses to accept btc more simply.

PayPal has fees unless the money is gifted, and its not about profit in this instance. It's an opportunity to show the ease of use and privacy  to in informed folk, yes you will know it's someone near you buy very unlikely you will be able to say hey Joe, enjoying bitcoin and the WiFi with out checking the connected devices on the party to use  network.

Long term it's only gone up. I have a little I mine years ago that was worth like $.12   Now it's worth just under $4.   Way back when CPU mining was a thing I actually mined a block but just thought it was a cool experiment that wouldn't gain any ground, that hard drive has since been reformatted a couple times, died and tossed in the trash , I think the per BTC price at that time was $.02

But In This case he didn’t accidentally send btc to their account, he did it intentionally.  He actively sought THEIR cold storage to send btc to.  Its going to be very hard proving it was an accident as a simple typo wouldn’t have resulted in this.

What reason would a consumer have to send btc to a companies cold storage other than a donation or some sort of fraud.

Lets make virtual currency illegal, It would ruin game play also, as Gold in WoW or any other rpg is a virtual currency. People would begin bartering, then boots swords and potions are the new currency, also banned. RPGs would boil down to click-tastic games like the original diablo minus the gold,weapons and loot, and you end up punching everything to death. But that gets ruined also because you can no longer take ears as trophies because you may trade them with other players as if trading baseball cards.
