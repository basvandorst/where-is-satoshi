Go somewhere else that has no fees. It's like y'all don't understand how businesses work, and then you don't want to take responsibility for your own actions. It's 100% your responsibility to read the fine print when signing up for things and to act accordingly. I've never paid for a checking account in my life. Why is that? Because I've never signed up for a checking account that has fees or contingencies associated with it.

Nice long post to basically say, "Your taxes do indeed help fund public infrastructure"
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:53:11
The UX for bitcoin is awful. Until it drastically improves and becomes on par with sending money via the popular apps, it has no shot.  I build apps for a living, and if someone proposed something with the UX of bitcoin, they'd get laughed out of the building.

It really is. Think critically, support what is good, don't support what is bad. Don't base your life and personal values based on political affiliation.
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:09:08
One thing is for sure. You guys will get to spend all that money you don't pay in taxes on tinfoil for some sweet hats before they haul your ass off to jail.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:32:25
The usage of it would be impossible, but they could shut down major exchanges absolutely nuking the price of it.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:43:24
Realistically, the community would massively panic. The price would plummet, and there will be the same mix of delusional people on both sides spouting off their unsubstantiated thoughts of why it would be good or bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:38:22


You answered your own question. When it becomes reasonable and safe to use.  People who can't even navigate hdmi ports on their tv menu need to be able to buy things and handle their personal finances securely with it.  Currently the entire climate around using bitcoin is terrible, and you can't directly spend it anywhere most people want to shop.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:31:56
Feel free to enlighten me on how public infrastructure is paid for.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:41:45
The guy is clearly a moron and does not understand how shit works.


Yeah because our college fees pay for all our elementary - high school.


And the ones that don't? Government steps in. 


They also come out of taxes you pay to the state which is based on income. You literally vote on measures in election cycle on this, though something tells me half of you have never voted.
Utility infrastructure and maintenance is also at least partially government funded
Of course he skips over the laundry list of other thing income taxes help fund like assistance programs, military (yes it is important to have one), parks, food subsidization, etc...

I hope you don't use any public roads, utilities, or expect the fire department to save your ass when your shit is burning down.

You described yourself perfectly. A gambler. You are taking a high risk for a high reward.  Smart investors diversify. Gamblers go all in. It could work out for you. I hope it does, but it doesn't make you some mega genius and your friends dumb.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:41:05
It's a benefit that you get to reap the benefits of as a buyer so that you don't get scammed. It goes both ways.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:24:47
Not saying it will, but if the US + EU does something crazy and outright bans Bitcoin trading, you are fucked. Its value is going to free fall into irrelevancy.  They'll have a roof over their head with a (likely) appreciating asset. Their advice about diversification is 100% good advice and not ignorant at all. I'm decently invested in bitcoin, but I am not going to nuke my 401k to throw it in BTC. I am investing what I can afford to lose because it's a possibility.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:38:02
That's like saying your house has break in protection because you closed the door. One of the largest things holding bitcoin back is the extremely shitty user experience. I trust my mother sending money via apps like zelle, and the woman can barely use a tv remote. No way in hell would I trust her to use bit coin. I'm saying this as someone who owns bitcoin.

I'd bet everything I own + a 500k loan on credit cards still being more widely used than crypto in 10 years. Change takes a very very long time, and crypto has an exceptionally long way to go before it is as convenient to use as the payment systems we have today. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:50:02
More likely it will be 5/6ths the price, and you do miss out on things that come with buying a new car like specific warranties.  I highly advocate people buy good used cars, but there are always question marks involved when buying used. I had nothing but used cars for the first 13 years I drove. Had mostly good results. Bought new for the first time last year, and the peace of mind is nice. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:32:23
Because 99% of people don't have any to begin with.  It's 1000x easier to go to the bank, grab some cash, hand cash to seller instead of some (likely non technical person) to figure out how to get bitcoin without dumping extra money in fees, then transfer that to you without making it just disappear in thin air. My mother can barely figure out how to get on facebook, but she can go to the bank and get money and be back in a few minutes. Until bitcoin becomes hyper convenient and safe to use, cash will always be the preferred medium.
@_date: 2019-03-26 15:11:25
Is American express a bank? Just because you offer a credit card doesn't mean you are a bank. Also if companies are going to bring something new to the table, I'm all for it. Competition is good. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:43:37
Depends greatly on the brand, usage of the car, etc.
@_date: 2019-03-01 01:47:23
It depends. The vast majority of users on this sub likely have under 300 dollars worth of BTC. It is not worth it in my opinion, to purchase an 80 dollar device to protect that amount of money. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:27:50


You also can't swipe your card and buy something with bitcoin anywhere in the civilized world. There's still essentially 0 convenient infrastructure in place with bitcoin. We'll need banks until there is.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:46:13
I hope we get to that point, but I don't know a single place around me where I can pay with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:37:10
I'd wager most users of this sub don't remember these things.
@_date: 2019-08-02 05:37:00
You are in bitcoin, but consider a 1% dip a punch in the dick?
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:45:47
Noone forces you to work a job. If you don't like the pay, go get a job somewhere else for more. Unskilled labor usually pays very low amounts.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:35:29
I'm a bitcoin fan and these are most of my talking points against it. The infrastructure around bitcoin is fucking terrible. My mother can hardly figure out which hdmi input the cable is hooked to. Think im going to have her start using bitcoin? Not a chance.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:32:51


This depends entirely on what happens with bitcoin in the future?
@_date: 2019-08-22 20:43:56


Mostly no because you can't, or it's a pain in the ass with some extra steps and ambiguity when it comes to security.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:45:09
Do you have a skill that warrants a high salary? You don't usually just "find" jobs that pay well. You get paid well if you have valuable skills that others don't.
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:25:50
Imagine actually thinking this.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:42:13


This is such a terrible mentality to have. Bitcoin is pretty awful in many ways as well. You want bitcoin to be "the one" because you have some and want to make money off it.  If any tech that is more sound comes along, people should be open to adopting it.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:52:48
I don't own any BCash. The point is, if something better does come along, people should use it. The worlds economy has 0 shot at running on bitcoin unless extremely massive advances are made.
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:56:00
You could try cash app, but I'm having a hard time seeing how so many ways of purchasing btc are failing on you.  Either user error or something very shady.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:27:14
Most people in this sub do and it frustrates me. The original tweet in this image has a point. It's still far too difficult to use bitcoin. It needs to become easier and less possible to just nuke your entire net worth on accident.

If you are overpaying bills by semi large sums of money, I fear for your use of sending crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:46:04
Typically this is an awful financial strategy. Pay down debts first. Then invest. If bitcoin does well you'll be in a better spot now. If bitcoin goes back down you are out money and accruing interest.

Why the fuck would I worry about the money of millionaires? I'll continue to use ublock, and If I'm so inclined to directly support content creators, I'll use their referral links for things, and not shorten the lifespan of my hardware.

The USA is a massive focal point in the economies of the world. It would be naive to think something like this happening would not have a massive effect on Bitcoin especially when a handful of people can already manipulate the fuck out of it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:58:16
That's usually the case (which is totally fine), but I always get a chuckle when people are freaking out about the price of btc and have like 100 bucks invested. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:22:01
And leave it up to (likely) non technical people to try and recover. I'd be better off posting my keys on reddit.

Rightfully so. What other asset swings up and down in price by magnitudes of 80+%.  Anyone completely invested in bitcoin is playing with fire. It's why people frequently reiterate "Only investing what you can afford to lose." Noone knows where bitcoin is going on any given day.

@_date: 2019-05-13 23:46:30
I think it just depends on how much money you put in. The vast majority of this sub has less than 1000 in crypto hoping it will turn them into millionaires.

I got downvoted for saying bitcoin is volatile on this sub. They are a fickle bunch.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:50:13
There in lies the problem. Many people ask me if I can build them an app or a website, but when I ask if they are going to pay me 10-50k to do it they all the sudden realize why so many ideas don't get created. I'm not gonna take all the risk for someone else's idea.

You are either already rich, have 0 expenses, or really stupid. Salary should be one of you primary concerns when it comes to a job.
