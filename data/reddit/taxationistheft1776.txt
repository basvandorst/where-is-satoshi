from 9am to 10am PST, Coinbase/GDAX market will be post-only, trading should actually start around 10am, BCH market will probably move to 5k in the 30 min before total dump, 2000 seems to by the floor for how low it would go before "investors" will start to buy it up again
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:04:58
agreed, it is crazy, and there is alot of room to grow. and as people keep saying, china and other huge markets haven't even hit yet for the most part. i am worried however about potential market manipulation when big money with bottomless pockets come in. a big volume buy could skyrocket the price, then a huge selloff could crash the price, allowing then to place a big buy cheap again. and repeat at the expense of the little guys

fork is dead. hoorah, time to put the pitchforks down
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:37:26
coinbase is hiring remote customer service reps.....work from home
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:20:57
i just looked back for the article, coinbase plans to shutdown trading 24hr prefork (
it looks like gdax trading will pause only 4hrs pre fork (
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:30:42
well 168mil divided by 7k is 24k BTC.  GDAX's 24 hr volume is total amount of order fills (buy and sells) in the past 24hrs only on gdax, so if HYPOTHETICALLY someone was able to buy 24k BTC (not gonna happen all at once), it would raise the volume by that amount, but its just simply not gonna happen

Not at all, it's taking months to pay off my car haha, I'm simply implying why wait months to see a return when you can invest in bitcoin and make a return instantly
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:50:57
agreed! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:41:47
theyll pay you in bitcoin too if your into that haha, or the usd
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:59:40
been on and off all day, socket keeps disconnecting..keep refreshing for now, they are overloaded
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:34:14
i think we will see 8,500 by New Years, 13k in the spring wouldnt be out of the ballpark
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:29:31
do you mine? have you tried selling an old mining rig.....what do you say to all the gpu miners who invested thousands to be made obsolete by asics? what happens when your antminer shits on itself and no longer works fully after a year (always amazes me how chinese shit always dies right after its warranty...its like they do it on purpose...oh wait..they do)  you tell me, is that really worth the hassle? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:17:29
imho, no, with any given machine, like the antminer s9, it would takes months to pay off itself, even with free electricity. by the time its paid off something newer and greater would be on the market. better off just investing in bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:11:12
Agreed....thats why personally all my BTC is out of coinbase/gdax. Just going off what they posted.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:09:02
transfer to gdax from coinbase (same company) if you plan on selling/trading/buying more, fees are way lower and you can put in a limit buy or sell instead of coinbases forced "market price". eventually when u grow out of gdax move on to bigger and better things
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:54:23
if you do sell, gdax's usd wallet is safe enough, i wouldnt leave any significant amount of money on there longterm, personally i dont think anythings gonna go all armageddon or anything. im taking my money out of bitcoin and holding as usd until its clear which coin will prevail. afaik, coinbase/gdax plans to support both. 24hrs before the fork cbase/gdax is going to halt all transactions, so there is a small possibility you wont be able to do anything with your btc before the fork, even if that happens you should be ok as cbase will credit you in B2X equal to what you have in btc. once trading opens back up, youll be able to sell either as you desire, hypothetically speaking, the combined total of BTC and B2X shouldnt be any less than what you paid for you btc initially, who knows you might even come out of the hard fork with some extra change lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:40:44
Ive had cbase/gdax transactions go thru faster than they say it will, in my experience itll probably clear midday on the 14th....if the price has dropped significantly by then, dont panic and sell it at a loss, just create a safe paper wallet or something and transfer it out of cbase if you dont want to be apart of the initial BTC/B2X bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:38:54
i wouldnt call b2x a lock yet, nobody really knows what may happen
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:48:07
Go back to r/btc ..... they'll be happy to hear of your bitcoin cash fandom
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:28:07
higher accumulated difficulty....i.e. more miners back it......at least thats what coinbase has said
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:39:25
those damned big money "day traders" who are constantly manipulating the market with huge selloffs and huge buys
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:30:00
afaik, they are devolpers and representatives from the bigger markets/corporations. the six people can call if off because they're the people that signed the New York Agreement and pushed the 2x shit in the firstplace lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:48:50
Coinbase will let you trade both, but they plan on naming whichever chain has the highest accumulated difficulty "Bitcoin". The 2x coins might be the ones to hold on to. Nobody knows haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:31
+1 on the profit taking
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:15:15
this ^^^
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:31:35
read about segwit2x and decide if now is the best time for you to invest.  coinbase has an article on their blog about how they plan to handle S2X.  if you do still decide to pull the trigger, i reccomend gdax if your comfortable with trading. its the same company as coinbase but lower fees. personally i believe cbase/gdax are safe enough to store anything less than a couple bitcoin on as long as you have a strong password/secure computer, and 2FA.  if you plan to hold for the longterm, definitely move it out to hardware wallet or something offline
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:48:48
i would hold your btc for dear life. big money is about to enter the market, we will likely see 10k/btc by new years
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:41:15
+1 on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:35:45
its a shame you fellas to the north are forced to use those damned canuckistan kopeks as currency, heres to one day bitcoin running the world
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:44:25
no, i think they are the bigger ones though, and signed on behalf of some of the smaller ones
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:10
not for me
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:01:02
assuming you have free electricity, your only mining about .0023 BTC/month or 17 dollars/month. if you dont have free electricity, your losing money running the outdated s3. sorry amigo...not worth it
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:47:28
the NYA signatories have cancelled it
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:48:17
understandable,i hope other companies follow suit and start offering remote jobs for crypto......that would be the future and thank you :)
