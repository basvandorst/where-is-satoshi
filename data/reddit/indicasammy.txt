It's tough -- I'm very optimistic and want it to be approved, but what do I know?

Just be the engraver yourself

I was about to post the same question. Do they normally hold off until the last day, or can it be any day now?
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:57:02
What about 75% Amazon and Shopify stock, and 25% bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:38:35
True. I was thinking more of engraving the private key. Would be funny to engrave it on a worthless object which would make it worth a lot more.

Thanks for your reply. I just put in $150, and at the current payout rate I should break even in about a year..we'll see what happens. As the btc price rises, don't my payouts become more valuable as well since they are in btc?

But he's already in the 100k club!

Which is why we all need to move to decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare

Thinking of opening a new credit account to buy now and pay back over the introductory 0% APR for 12 months. Too risky?

EVERYTHING can get hacked. Your email, your savings, and anything else that is online. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:35:13
Thanks, will probably follow this advice! Now, how much to buy......
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:09:18
What if it gets denied and price dips a bit. Then we will buy at 800 or 900 and get 25% more than you 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:04:30
Well my 0.00171264 BTC a day will add up quickly 
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:12:00

@_date: 2017-03-01 16:13:40
