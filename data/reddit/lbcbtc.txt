You should read all his books (in that trilogy). Antifragile is the best. The first book I find most useful but it is full of irrelevant anecdotes

There are so many errors in the article, but the part that I find shocking is:


You think Im going to take investing advice from a guy who was obsessed with powderpuff girls when he was a kid? "The Brony School of Economics"

It is the first result on google when you search "quick bitcoin wallet". It is mentioned on techcrunch and coindesk, and this quick check would have led me to believe it is legit. The founder was active answering questions on reddit.
If it is a scam then fair enough, but it is a scam any reasonable person could have fallen for

You have completely lost sight of what this discussion is about. The issue is whether she knows much about he technology.
Jobs was a great CEO and knew fuck all about the engineering of Apple products.
You've just bamboozled yourself
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:00:52
Yes it does. You're actually comparing another person in a completely different industry from hundreds of years ago - that is seriously stupid
Technicality in music =/= technicality in technology

Ah ok I heard a similar fishy quote from Stark so thought you were quoting that. I'll bin that comment so!

You're an idiot. The technicals of the bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology are not vague subjective concepts like music quality. Either you understand cryptotechnology or you don't. Bitcoin not being advanced runs contrary to your point.
I can't believe you're suggesting that someone who doesn't even write code and has no technical background (she has a legal education) and has no deep knowledge of advanced crypto concepts **is some secret supergenius who is operating in a different creative paradigm that we cannot understand because she's too advanced**. Your comparison hinges on her being to crypto what Beethoven is to music. 


Congrats... this is the single cringiest thing I have ever had anyone say to me on the internet ever. "Salesperson who doesn't actually write any code is punk, embodying a sense of anti-authoritarianism, a do-it-yourself ethic, non-conformity, direct action and not "selling out" (which is what punk means)."
You wouldn't understand what punk, or technical genius were if they slapped you on the face.
Seriously man stop chugging koolaid

The cringe in this thread is intense
She's a salesperson. As u/InstantGangBonus said, there is nothing to suggest she actually knows much about the technology, and she also seems dishonest.
Of course, crypto needs salespeople too, but don't pretend they're anything more than salespeople
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:09:01
No, it's not. You obviously a) don't work in the tech industry at management level and b) haven't actually watched much of her talks.
She has said literally nothing that shows a deep understanding of complex crypto or tech concepts. You're the kind of person who thinks that Steve Jobs hand built and programmed the iphone

"The CEO as salesperson" is a common management concept endorsed by many researchers and industry experts. It is the observation that CEOs are in many ways mostly representatives for their organisation and must lead by communication. This is not a controversial statement in management science. Jobs was referred to as the supreme salesperson who drove Apple's rise to success.
It doesn't mean this role is easy, and is doesn't mean they're literally only a salesperson.
It means that their role is not to work on product or innovation as much as steer the message

Someone, somewhere will read this comment and actually do this

The Sun is a rag. Plus I've heard this "Bitcoin capital of the world" shit before... Estonia, Barcelona, Jacksonville, wherever. Its easy to send out a press release.

Cheers. Mycelium seems so much better than blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:19:47
I actually managed itin my blockchain.info wallet easily. Thanks for the input though, think I'm gonna switch to mycelium anyway
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:27:32
Yeah I just saw that post after asking here! It worked.
Thanks all the same. I have the address and private key, any idea what the fastest wallet/way to sweep the BTC is?
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:20:22
That's slick thanks for the info
