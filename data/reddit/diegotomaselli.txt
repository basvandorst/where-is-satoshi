Because they LOVE free lunches.. 
..they cannot see the inflation that is allowed now to pay miners.. 
Paying a coffee with the most secure system ever invented makes a lot of sense to them.

I'm from Italy, thank you very much for posting this!
I'm no expert in cryptoart, so I will just say that the most interesting part of this doc is the "tone" used when speaking about Bitcoin..
The "boring part about Bitcoin" is actually the most exciting to me, since an "emanation" of the Italian Gov is basically describing the possible revolution that Bitcoin could bring, not only in Arts (the real topic of the doc) but all over financial institutions and even governments....
He says, quite literally: "..if Bitcoin will achieve success, then probably cash, banks and even States might become just part of History's books."
In other words, it's giving Bitcoin the weight it really deserves... going even beyond just Finance!
Not something one can witness everyday...

Ask yourself: in a future world full of cryptocurrencies, which one will you prefer for your savings (and for your expenses while traveling or to settle your international affairs)?
The one mined by the Chinese Government???

In Italy we have an exchange dedicated to energy and you can witness wild price swinging... So this idea makes a lot of sense: producers can just use the excess of energy instead of "giving it away"...

When he will finally move them, the price of BTC in dollars would just be nonsensical... 
Nobody will use dollars by that time, hence no sense to panic-selling BTC to switch back to whatever dead currency.
Being nonsensical, even the hypothesis of Satoshi selling his stash would be just unconceivable..
If he's moving it, it would be just to buy whatever he wants, but not another useless currency...
Maybe he wants to buy a Country, who knows... but not fiat for sure! 
This would be just stupid (years from now).
That's my hope, now the probable truth: it will move it when a big big BIG short will be doable (Hearn did it on a smaller scale IMHO).

Not a good line for newcomers: talking about confirmations is just confusing (if not even scary.... something that needs X confirmations??!?!?!?!).
Just say half an hour.

Tell them that the source code is available to hackers since 2009.
Hackers still prefer to crack Microsoft non-readable exe to spread viruses, encrypt data and then ASK FOR BITCOIN...
It's quite self explanatory... :-)

I think he's right here: "Scott concludes that, in not understanding".
But for some reason, there are additional nonsensical words all over.

The point is that you cannot write anymore in the main chain: ie, you can play with your friend, yes, but nobody will accept your coins... or to be more precise, they will let you spend what you originally had unspent on the main chain... ie, you can just fool your friend on your personal fork, giving him all of your coins and he cannot spend them, since that transaction simply doesn't exist for the rest of the World..

To be honest, if you live in a Country that's considered "infamous" for its frauds, it's already difficult to purchase something online..
There's no trust but also no chaos, hence that scenario is actually happening somewhere to some extent..

PayPal hiring Wence is my latest favorite...
But also the stability of the price in absence of good news IS a good news itself, considering that every ten minutes there are 25 new bitcoins out there.....

Because they are attached to their current infrastructure: a big central server can handle a blockchain and, being supposedly secure, add "money" to it (just numbers, in the end).
Using Bitcoin instead, will render ALL their superprotected supercomputers completely useless.
They have enough money to surpass Chinese miners, of course, but psicologically speaking, it's absolutely not easy to simply get rid of such a "Castel of Power".
But there are a lot of smart people in there, sooner or later someone will point out that using Bitcoin would be just better.

If you produce one block every minute, you will increase the chance that two different valid blocks will be propagating at the same time..
10 minutes seemed just convenient... 
Clearly the goal was NOT to pay on the rush...
(..Maybe good to pay for a dinner while ordering instead of at the end...)

...a BlockChain in the Cloud is not immutable anymore.... this can be seen as a feature, even if it's their first bug, clearly.

To modify such limit you have to convince the vast majority of miners...
Now the problem is back to whoever is asking such question..
How to convince someone making money to destroy the value of his money????
Of course, a stupid guy can be lured into something cool like printing new money...
But one stupid worth nothing..
You have to convince many smart people.. 
This would be possible only in a distant future where Bitcoin is the ONLY survivor, hence there's little risk of people moving to another non-inflated coin...
In that scenario one Bitcoin would worth 1/21m of the entire planet (ie more than 1 billion of those extinct USD).
Given that other crypto will exist (hence competion!) few people can be so stupid to change such cap...
Hence, it will never happen.
