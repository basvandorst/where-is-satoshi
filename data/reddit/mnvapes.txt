seems like a lot of effort to sell .25 worth of fake bitcoin in 2014... Are you sure? it says quarter bitcoin on the other side so I assume it's already loaded.

I searched the 12 characters on that site and got 0 hits. I can't find it on any blockchain explorer.

Address starts with a 1 but doesn't show up on any blockchain explorer. I swear it did years ago when I first looked it up though.

Congratulations, you aren't an entitled sociopath. That doesn't change the fact there's tons of sociopaths to function in your stead.

Oh, I'm used to actually having to compile things. Sorry I'm a total newbie to linux. Last time I used it I attempted to daily drive it for about a week 10 years ago lol. So I've got 0.6.1 running and my wallet is still not showing the correct balance. Am I totally screwed out of thousands of dollars here or what? I don't understand why it's only showing transactions from last year when I clearly backed up this wallet.dat 4 days ago and the last change to the wallet.dat actually occurred may 22 of this year. How does it just disappear? I can see the address on [blockchain.info]( clearly still holds all of the coins I'm missing so it's not like I lost or misplaced the coins or anything. The wallet just refuses to display them...  
  
\*EDIT\* HOLY CRAP. I just removed my current wallet.dat from my home directory and replaced it with the one I've been trying to use from backup this whole time and my full balance is suddenly there... This has been so stressful as I'm currently unemployed and that coin is literally all of the financial assets I possess. You guys saved my ass in a big big way. Thank you so very much!

My last transaction was over a month ago and I backed up 4 days ago now. My bitcoin client is fully synced and I'm most definitely using the correct directories for both backup and restore. The only thing I can think of is that my bitcoin core client is out of date. On windows I was using 1.6.1 but on linux the latest version I can get installed is 1.6 because that's all that's listed in the repo... Does anyone know how I can get 1.6.1 installed?

Yes, they were explicitly generated receive addresses. I generated 2 dozen recieve addresses and so far no dice. I tried launching the wallet from the console with the option -zapwallet and I noticed I'm receiving quite a few error messages. Could these be the issue?
`me bitcoin.qt -zapwallet`
`Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "gail"`
`Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "atk-bridge"`
`Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"`
`Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported`
`libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found`
`libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast`

I did back up my whole disk and unfortunately there's no other wallet.dat files to be found. the wallet is a few years old but I last used it a week ago. It is an HD wallet and unfortunately generating a new receive address doesn't seem to have helped :(
\*edit\* If I know the addresses that are supposed to be there is there any way I can just re-add them to the wallet?
