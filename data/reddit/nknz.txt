He jokingly says Bitcoin will crash so people send their bitcoins to his wallet address found in the QR code.

Very good looking at your portfolio! I didn't do much researching back in the day, I still don't know much about this. I kind of learned just enough how to buy a cryptocurrency and how to keep it safe. Bought it spontaneously! Haven't traded anything, just bought and forgot, until recently. Going to take a deeper dive into this all now that cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing.
Best of luck in this!

What's at 18 December?

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:57:14
I understand it's a joke, but what made you come up with the specific number?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:11:37
Yes, I still have them. I acknowledged the value of Bitcoin shortly after I bought it (few months in) and refused to do anything but wait and see because the value has been just climbing. You're free to have your opinion. I knew they'll be increasing in value seeing how slowly, but steady it went from the initial entry to the date I made the transaction with the seller.
I forget it in a way of not constantly checking the status of BTC in the markets, not caring about it and it came to a point where I absolutely forgot about it (not what Bitcoin is, but the fact I had them on me) because I always have had a solid source of income for my needs so I didn't rely on BTC. As suggested, I will cash out for my needs - something I haven't done since I purchased them.
The purchase was spontaneous, a little bit of research and action, without risk evaluating, so that adds up to how easy it is to forget.
By "I doubt it has a real value" I thought about it in a more of a practical way, rather than theoretical. It is very valuable, but not every seller, from the products that I'm interested in, accepts Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:26:51
Thanks for the example!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:56
Pretty much.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:24:56
You are welcome
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:23:27
Yes, it's all in BTC. I'm going to observe the direction the value goes within the upcoming weeks and then I'll do the decision. Not going to take it all out, because that's not a good decision regardless of the point of view.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:02:24
Oh I realized hah. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:28:29
I heard about this. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:58:19
Best wishes!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:44:02
Well said and a nice take on it. Thanks.

Don't feed the troll

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:22:20
Agree. Read my other post, this serves as the reason why I'm very excited :D
Was about to cash out a portion of my investment, but seeing that it didn't hold on 12k for a full day and went up to 13k, I'm holding. It's going to be 15k+ before New Year. I'm expecting a dip in January though, but that's just me.
Edit: typo

It's Tesla
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:33:48
Yeah haha, just because of the lesson I learned by not buying bitcoin at its initial entry at a few cents, I'm not going to hold myself back from buying a cryptocurrency that pops up out of nowhere sometime soon for at least $15 in total, since they all start at a few cents. You know, I'd love losing said amount of money rather than realizing I could have made enormous amount of money if I would have bought it, but actually didn't. Hope it makes sense.

The best time to buy Bitcoin is always now - regardless in when you're reading this
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:38:11
Nobody wants it, but it's to be seen. You can feel now. We'll see next week, including tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:23:52
Yep, cex.io is good. Bought there myself. You didn't buy the whole coin, did you?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:40:45
You won't get much
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:12
Pretty much. Can happen, or can't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:12:05
I know right, lol. OP. INVEST AND STOP ASKING
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:42
Maybe.

It is a scam.

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:11:37
Lol, I don't think your phone is compromised. Wallets on phones are less prone to attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:00
Not really. I'm more impressed the rate in which it's climbing rather than the worth of it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:43:28
Cloud mining is made to benefit the other end.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:27:47
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:10:48
Years later you will regret not buying bitcoin at 15k. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:33:39
Yes. That is true. You can have the most secure platform, but still have it hacked if you don't know what you're doing 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:39:08
I mean it's coming
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:32:30
Indeed. Never cash out. Sell when totally sure, but if you sell, don't be sad because you could have made X2 if you would have waited a day. Seeing current rates
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:50:44
You tried
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:24:47
I don't have any that I haven't paid for anymore, that's the greatest thing about this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:13:15
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:27:37
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:31:05
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:55
No. You're going to be at loss if you mine on cloud. These sites are made to benefit the other side.

Upvoted for publicity.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:31:58
Oh, you're so wrong
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:31:36
No thanks lol, after all these exit scams, no one is going to trust or fall in such tricks. Plus the website isn't working. Good luck finding people that still fall for this.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:33:19
I, of course, am biased in my reply above. If this is a legitimate attempt of gaining credibility, go ahead. But again, you're using Reddit in accomplishing that, so I take that away
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:45:07
Good choice.

I will not take any insider information serious. I'm waiting for a reference from other reliable sources.
