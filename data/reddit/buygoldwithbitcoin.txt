I'd like to thank Patrick M. Byrne  for his foresight in beating them to the punch. It's going to be an interesting year.
So... eBay? PayPal? Are you guys asleep at the wheel? C'mon, you're leaving a lot of money on the table! Why the wait?

When asked about the meaning of crypto-gold, she explained, “We’re literally putting gold onto the blockchain. You and I both know that the blockchain works as a ledger system, so it’s another way of showing your gold holdings. It will be audited by a major auditing firm, but I can’t say their name at the moment. So that’s kind of the stage one, that this is another way of storing your gold, on the blockchain. It’s still stored in vaults, so you have a currency and in that respect you can then use it. It’s a much easier way of trading gold, and hopefully at some point as a medium of exchange as well, that you can be spending your gold.” [[more...]](

Bitcoin: The way out of this mess.

According to this announcement, yes.

Put it carefully back into the box as it was originally packed, keeping it as mint as possible. Hodl on to it for 20 years. It has an interesting story. 
I know someone with a factory mint Commodore 64 that he's pretty happy about. What you have, however, is a testament to the early explosion of bitcoin.

I would let them float against each other, but not marry them together. They are two complimentary currencies. It's because anyone holding the gold for you is a point of weakness. Who keeps them honest? Haven't we learned that lesson with the Fed?

That was fun. Just the right length too.

I get the same effect here. I've seen activity on this map on a previous visit, but not right now.

This is a future I would love to live in. Transactions in gold, silver and bitcoin, each to its strengths and according to the situation. I believe the intersection of gold and bitcoin, as the OP has just illustrated, is where the real magic happens. That would be a solid economy.

I did a review of a simultaneous purchase from Amagi Metals and Agora Commodities.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:51:30
I know. I just reviewed Amagi Metals. They're great, aren't they? I wish the others would get a little more in line.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:00:07
Uhh... probably not! LOL
Although, the thought has crossed my mind.

I'd appreciate any feedback you can provide, so I can continue to improve the website. It was interesting seeing how different it was ordering from each store.
