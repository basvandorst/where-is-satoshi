The mainstream media is spewing out FUD.  Every 2% move is said to be Surging or Plunging.  I've got a thick skin, and I'm a HODLER, but you really have to stick to your plan to not be affected by this FUD and liquidate your positions.  It's a tough spot.  If you don't sell you give away money if it crashes, if you do sell, you might be giving away money if it moons   I surely don't want to lose what I have, and I equally don't want to be shoulda coulda woulda for the next 30 years!!!

As an older redditor I respectfully disagree.  In the late 60's the typical family could easily be supported by one working "man".  The average 3 bedroom house in the suburbs was affordable on far less than one year's salary.  It was not unusual to have "help" come to the house, have 2 cars and a nice vacation.  Going to the hospital didn't lead to bankruptcy.  And most of tuition for college could be handled more or less with a part time job.  It's hard to relate to this if you didn't experience it.  I compare my Dad's 75K with mine and the "power of the average salary" is dramatically less than it used to be.

The Twins are great, super articulate and are well familiar with "The Street".  I like that Gemini lets me trade right away, and then wait to withdraw instead of having to wait 10 days (current wait time CB) to fund the account and then trade. I'm happy to support them and only hope they grow and add more coins.

No, the interpretation by most tax professionals is that it is not a like-kind trade and so it is indeed a taxable event.  Let's say you trade BTC for ETH.  You bought BTC for $500 USD and then when you went to buy ETH with it, the BTC was worth $1,200.  The taxable transaction is a profit or capital gain of $700 on the BTC.  Your starting Cost Basis on ETH, is $1,200 USD.  Depending on if you held it for more than 1 calendar year or not, will determine whether it is a short or long-term capital gain.  In the US at least.

If you report your gains and pay your taxes, you get to sleep like a baby at night.  If you are using an exchange that asked for all of your identifiers, SS Bank Account, DL etc.... why would you assume transactions will be anonymous?    Not the best way to hide assets or transactions.

So far it seems that the USD pricing of Bitcoin is the main focus.  Your points are spot on.  If South Korea begins to become the focus for trading, will the KRW be the standard?  What would happen to the US economy if the USD were dethroned?  Can the US Government regulate unregulated digital currencies?  Can a free society be banned from buying an essentially virtual product without having to tell Uncle Sam?  Will programs and apps be banned next?  This is a historic economics experiment playing out in just a few days.

Interesting points on all sides.  People that buy Bitcoins IMHO have to be more tech savvy and comfortable with it being a non traditional financial product.  Not a fiat currency, not a physical commodity, not a share of a corporation. I think there are plenty of humans on the planet that meet the criteria.  If that is elitist fine.  Just like Warren Buffet feels no need to "dumb down" his share price, I think Bitcoin will do better without disguising it with a moved decimal place.  We are all comfortable with purchasing and selling fractions of a unit.  Let it be.  It's fine the way it is.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:27:10
I respectfully disagree.  If Gold was at 1.2 instead of 1200 it would lose the "psychological" value it has, even though the only change is a decimal place.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:29:54
Point one...You are not taking into consideration the relative value of the dollar in 100 years ago buying power versus today.  Two...In 1971 Nixon raised the price per ounce to $38 from $35. Three...In 1974 Ford unhinged gold from the dollar and it became a free market tradable commodity.  Gold at $20 an ounce in the 1800's was an artificial price.  Free market pricing realizes whatever an object, currency, cryptocurrency is worth.  It's worth what people say it's worth.  The Dollar hasn't lost value compared to Gold, Gold has been released from the bondage of the dollar's value. The psychological value of where the decimal place is, is just that pyschological.

One potential for your suggestion is that it follows the same tendency that stocks do when they split.  The price tends to creep back up to what it was before the split.  So that would make us all happy!!!

I like Bitcoin for what it is, an unregulated crypto currency.  I also feel it the future.  I own an echo "Alexa", not so much for what it can do today, but because it is the future. I accept the volatility as part of the journey.  If people want to put their life savings into it, that's their decision.  Some go to Vegas and let it ride on the felt tables.  Accept Bitcoin for what it is, and you'll be fine.

This subreddit is filled with posts about delayed transactions and long wait times for replies.  All the posts from Rosie at Support etc are useless.  I even got dueling auto replies telling me to contact the main support and to contact the reddit coinbase support..... due to heavy support volume.
Personally, I wouldn't leave any Bitcoin or "cash" in the wallets at CB, and am looking for another place to buy and sell.  I sincerely hope all works out for you.  Sooner or later it has to be settled, or it will be considered fraud, and I don't think CB wants that kind of attention.

I've made incremental purchases and transfer to my Trezor.  Haven't had a problem yet.  The point of being anonymous was given up as soon as you gave all of your banking info and ID, the rest doesn't matter, you aren't anonymous.  And the IRS knows what you've done whether you keep the Bitcoins in Coinbase or not.  My only complaint is the time it takes to fund my USD wallet with a transfer from my bank.

Part of why I hodl my crypto, despite all the FUD, is because of my full faith in the greed of those on Wall Street and in the Bank Boardrooms.  They will manipulate anything they can to gain the most profit possible.  That is their job and they are well paid to do it.  They take positions then have their analysts release a statement while they short or go long to support their trade.  Goldman is correct though in stating the obvious that many crypto's will be worthless.  No different than trading penny stocks.

Forget Sentiment, focus on Supply and Demand.  There is a fairly long delay between the time accounts are opened on Coinbase and when they are funded and ready to play.  My opinion is there will be a lot of new money coming into the marketplace in the next few months, just based on how many accounts are being added daily right now.  I think the price level we are at now will be a joke sooner than later.

Here's a little secret for all you youthful redditors out there.  Just because your parents are ancient... in their 50's, doesn't mean they are clueless.  Don't forget, they lived through the introduction of the PC, and the emergence of the "Internet".  I'm a proud member of this ancient clan, and I've been eagerly following Bitcoin for a while.  Myself I've got a bit over 2.  I've learned about it, and have diversified into ETH as well.  I've even learned about cloud mining and have an "experiment" going on genesis.
Rather than this signaling the top, it's actually the start of the supply and demand equation.  Now if you will excuse me, all this typing has worn me out and I need to go take my meds and a nap.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:50:05
