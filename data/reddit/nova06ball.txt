Sounds like savings accounts still work? At least to take money out?

It’s possible the SEC wants a plain template with tons of words on it, but man that’s a dry presentation

Sent you Coinbase, Robinhood, and Binance links. 
Robinhood is great for stocks and will eventually be good for crypto. 
Coinbase is the best place to start for Crypto.

Hitbtc is awful.

I have it on a disk (or you can download it) which I believe is the only way to actually upload files. The web version doesn’t support that from what I understand

[bitcoin.tax]( 
Really easy to use and exports your trades from exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:46:28
I used it and really liked how I could just upload it to TurboTax and be done with it. 
If you do sign up and pay I have a referral link: [bitcoin.tax]( 
If you use it I greatly appreciate it!

I’ll third [bitcoin.tax]( 
-makes sense of your trades from each exchange 
-can export a file for use with tools like TurboTax
-there is a cost but it’s affordable
