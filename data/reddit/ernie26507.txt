I don’t know man! Lol you know they always come out with weird crap to tax. Cool, now just to find out what that cap is

Hold on I’m confused, do I have to pay taxes if I bought big coin in Coinbase and then transferred it to Binance for ripple?
I’ve never treated any of the coins to USD to with draw to put into my bank account.
I have recently bought bit coin when it was low and tried to sell when it was high, honest to God I think I made a dollar or two.

I got it all set up, thanks for the help ������ now how long does it taken to transfer from GDAX? lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:38
I read that as well. I was trying to and then it wanted all my info. Last for of SSN, gov ID, address all that. 
What do you think? Safe?
If I do that can I trader from GDAX to my Ledger?

LOL! �������� that really did make me bust out laughing, well never know maybe some people will slid some money my way hahaha

Great info, thank you! All I’ve this has all been with in a month. I haven’t been doing this longer then a few weeks. 
I’ve lost $32 in bitcoin but I’ve made $40 in ripple. How would they know what I have if it’s sitting offline on my Ledger nano? 
This all sounds like a headache ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:06:17
Awesome! Thank you :) I’m gonna try it and see if anyone out there does lol
One more question, I’ve looked online all day today. Is there anyway to buy ripple with josh a debit card? Without having to submit all your info line a gov ID?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:10:58
I haven’t made any money from bitcoin I’ve actually lost money, do I need to clame that? I did buy bitcoin then buy ripple with that bitcoin. I put that ripple on my  nano Ledger s. According to my math I’ve make like $40 from ripple. 
Do I have to claim this one like if it’s under a certain amount you don’t need to pay?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:08:50
Haha yea it is, but I was thinking more down the long run if I was ever fortunate enough to have a decent amount I could just keep in a safe place 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:58
Ah ok, well I’ll give it a a shot. Will GDAX  change a arm and a leg too? Lol
