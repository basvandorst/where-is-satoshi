I think we'll look back on this in 6 months to a year and wish we were as brave as you.

BTC was $2k July 2017. 1 year ago.   
2030 is an age away when it comes to crypto my friend.   
It's speculative and (i agree, a little pointless) but if you watch the video - it's states, "*let's have some fun and dream"* and I make the case for why it *might and can* happen.

I wouldn't go as far as to say it's likely... But it's a possibility.
Try watching the video and you might find out why I think so....

And we've finally gone full circle. I feel this is meant to be.

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti.

Yeah, it's important to spread the awareness to the wider crypto community. Also serves as I nice way to get word out about my project. Silver linings ay?

Not all projects are 'shit coins'. Some are trying to make a difference. Watch this space, we'll prove it.

It's not, but okay.
Good luck going forward pal.
@_date: 2019-10-13 07:52:09
Well done, I applaud your efforts. Hero.

Guess who's back, bakkt again
Bitcoin's back, tell a friend.

I beg to differ, we've seen excitement and demand grow. We're forging strong partnerships. Sure, you could donate 100% to the charities, I hope you go and do it now... But you won't.
Kingdom Token creates an incentive. It genuinely is an asset that has a speculative value. Sure it won't fit the risk portfolio of many, and if you think its useless then it isn't for you.
If you look at baseball cards as a collectable, that too seems stupid and they never should hold their value. Same with Cryptokittes. To put it in simple terms, if enough people believe, then it'll work and we'll raise a good amount of money in doing so.
I'm just trying to put a unique spin on something :)

Not really I suppose, but we're all a big family. The crypto community. I wanted to try and get this message out there to the people that it might be relevant. Apologies if you didn't find it relevant.
