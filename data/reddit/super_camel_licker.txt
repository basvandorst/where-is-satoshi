Gonna be a unpopular opinion around here, but it doesn’t matter. If you are a American, it doesn’t matter where you made your money, what currency it’s in, ect. You owe American taxes. That’s how it’s always worked and how it will always work. 
Welcome to the world of getting shafted by the IRS. The stock trading community has had this luxury to ourselves for the 50 years.

Crypto can “destroy the system” but it won’t be peacefully done just so you know. 
If you think America will give up the power the fed controls without killing people then you are mistaken. 
If you think that one day bitcoin will be the main currency in America, I can get behind that. But only if you understand that 100,000’s of people will die to over throw the most powerful system ever on the face of the planet. The US federal reserve.

You could go off the grid in another country, but you risk being extradited back to the states. We are talking millions+ you could pay for protection. But other than that your screwed. Pay up like the rest of us. 
Your now the rich that 48% of the us population thinks needs to pay more taxes.

Ummmm. That’s a new one. Never been accused of being a government agent before. 
That is how taxes work. It just is. I understand most of you didn’t realize this but it’s true. I’ve been trading stocks for over 15 years. You are always have had to fill out a form at the end of the year for every trade. I lived in Thailand for a couple years. Paid taxes on that job. Bought BTC at $13. Paid taxes on that. It’s just how it is.

You can do that. Depending on how much tax liability you have. Most country’s will take you for a couple hundred thousand. 
Also note though that the US will require your taxes be paid before they allow you to renounce your citizenship and most country, at least the ones you want to live in will require your taxes be paid before they grant you citizenship in there country. 
It’s not a quick and easy process. The grass isn’t always greener somewhere else.

First time buyer here, if I buy today on Coinbase, will I get my coins before or after futures trading starts? Or is there a waiting period for my funds to settle?

No. They are global corporations. 
You could go through a process of becoming a corporation in another country, then your corporations taxes would be paid according to that country’s local tax laws, but once that profit got distributed to you, the business owner, then American taxes would still Be owed because you are a American.

Yes. The same way all dictators are elected. What percent of the vote did he get? How many of his political enemies were found dead from “self inflicted” gun shots. Dude is a savage dictator. Nothing less. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:29:41
Exactly. They will stay this way now when all the normal people jump in. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:51:46
Network won’t be as congested. 
When normies jump back in. The fee’s won’t sky rocket again. 
Should slow the price to go higher.
