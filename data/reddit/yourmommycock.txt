No, a salesman explaining how a vibrating belt machine instantly burns fat is more analogous to how you guys sound.

What does ZDNet have to do with this other than being his employer? Who said this is journalism? It's a tweet on a personal Twitter account by someone who happens to work for ZDNet (I'm taking your word for it, here.) 
Get over it.

Convert the bitcoin to CDN dollars first and take the CDN dollars to a Canadian Tire store. Buy spark plugs. The chashier will give you a bit of Canadian Tire money back with your receipt. Do this a few times until you're out of CDN money but have a wad of Candian Tire money. You lose some value in the conversion process but it's still a lot easier than trying to spend bitcoin. 
Edit: correction. You GAIN value as you have spark plugs, receipt paper, and Canadian Tire money (stable currency) after the conversion process.

Maybe bitcoin will find these highly skilled people one day. As it is now, bitcoin can only attract the kind of people who create rickety bitcoin exchanges that get hacked, lose all their "value" and go tits up.

If you convert it to Canadian Tire money you can buy tents and hammers with it.
