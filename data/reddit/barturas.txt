wtf is happening, I only asked one question. Why nobody is trying to discuss it and troll instead? dumb as fk? seriously?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:20:39
thanks. what side effects are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:27:29
first of all stop using the word "troll". second you are not right I am really looking for answers ... third I'm using BTC from 2010 and loved philosophy behind it ... and now I hate to see corporate world trying to meddle with BTC ...
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:01:28
no, you'll get a badge so you could put it on your shirt next to other badges ... keep on good job.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:39:30
do whatever you want ... just imagine one day BCH will disappear ... And you won't have have easy answer "get out of BTC, go buy BCH" .. what will you use for your trolls? Oh you know what? I know you will use "get out of BTC you fking cryptocommie ..."

Go do your job, corporate troll.

we are opening a way to other side chains  .. how this is a safe manner for upgrade ... Also pretty one btc dev agrees that increasing block size is inevitable as adoption increases ... why do we need to introduce those external parties with proprietary technologies into btc community?

Get a life friend. Everythink is not revolving around reddit. You don't know me in person and your conclusions are childish.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:56:49
Yes, I know, thank you, but I am asking about BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:01:08
mkey ... anyone else?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:48:55
that's a good answer. thank you. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:59:18
ok, thanks. this sounds very reasonable. I think I need to continue my research in off-chain techs. Thanks a lot for you answers.

OP stands for original poster. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:31
who cares when bitcoin blockchain has 173257 (and growing) unconfirmed transactions ... that's ridiculous ...
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:04:47
this is fake, why would anyone need 2x if we already have 8x??

After three days I was able to finish withdrawal... that were very intense three days.  I cursed a lot. So after final withdrawal I submitted a ticked to disable my account with the message similar to that of op’s but added humble “kraken go f$&amp; yourself!”
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:05:38
Try to refresh few times and it should work... happened to me too
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:16:19
that's crazy...
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:12:05
interesting, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:08:35
op is clearly too stupid to understand Vitalik's argument
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:54:40
Have just read A. Korzybski?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:51:23
Yes, they give few messages. I got something like “your tier is too low for this operation”, feature disabled, cloudflare server time out... after refreshing like dozen times I finally managed to get to the eth withdrawal and withdraw. Once confirmed I submitted ticket to disable my account. I Never come back!

I use bitstamp for SEPA deposits and Bitfinex for trading. I like Bitfinex a lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:55:30
whats the difference between weigh and actual bytes of the block. Does 4M weigh mean the block could theoretically reach 4MB?
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:38:08
that's BS
