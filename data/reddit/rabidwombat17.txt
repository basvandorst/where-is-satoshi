Let me clarify, Legit reason is going to be subjective to the person coming up with it. Personally I don’t think a fear of missing out is a legit reason, but to someone else it totally could be. Is “save some cash when I spend it all on drugs” a legit reason? Sure if your buying in bulk and distributing for profit, you know what the % return is for most drugs? Fucking ridiculous, way higher than bitcoin. Colombians making lbs of blow for pennies on the dollar with a street value of a couple grand. There is that whole getting shot and decapitated by a cartel thing, but eh... where’s the fun if there is no risk.

Gemini has bitcoin at 15,150 right now...
Noob reaction:  sell all place is burning down!
My reaction: oh sweet, someone is having a Christmas sale on bitcoin today!

It’s a “meant to get a chuckle” kind of comment. Not a “hey look at me, here’s my advice” comment. I mean honestly who the hell takes advice from someone with the username RabidWombat... that’s just silly (you have to say that part in the Mad Hatter, animated version, voice to get the full effect)

I agree 100%. That’s why it’s important to stick to basic investing principles and not just hop into bitcoin/stocks/bonds/etc because it’s the hot thing. Only invest what you can afford to loose, have an exit strategy if shit really goes south, and have a legitimate reason for investing the money.  Fear of missing out, is not a legit reason.

Get people to buy in and use their currency. Then release a VR world space. Facebook didn’t buy Oculus, just to let it die. It’s just been waiting for the right time and proper tech/algorithm development.
Edit: I no spell well

Libra is Facebook in-game currency. First step to virtual reality world space. Develop the currency and get people to buy into it. Then release the world space. Something small at first, platform of games most likely as it’s successful at utilizing the real money:in game currency strategy. Bring back FarmVille, but have it be VR. Libra is already purchased ready to use currency, you won’t have to pause your VR experience to use a real world debit/credit transaction.
Freely admit I haven’t read much about Libra but I’d be willing to bet you can link your bank account to it. Again, if you run out of Libra in VR you can replenish it, with our breaking the VR experience.
