Next time move your funds to another wallet, never attempt to get forks or s**tcoins without moving funds away from those private keys you give first.
Also this, to everyone else. If you have moved your funds first before claiming, in the worst case scenario it would have claimed using those private keys any other forks, which are usually valued at less than 1% of btc value (except for bch and btg)

A lot of people have given answers that revolve in regards to halting trading, psychology(mostly in regards to order book), and even 'usdt' printing:






The most accurate answer of all these so far looks like this:


Thus, the answer is that, the average trading volume would need to be 6 times bigger in terms of usd, at least.
If bitcoin is currently trading at 10k$, then when bitcoin would be trading at 60k$, the average trading volume would need to be at least the exact same, in terms of btc, but six times bigger(60k$/10k$), in terms of usd.
Current 24h trading volume from coinmarketcap.com, estimates it at 6.5bn$, and 500k btc, per day.
The trading volume in usd, at 60k$, would have to be 6*6.5bn = 39bn$. At around 40bn$. That, considering that the btc trading volume stays constant at 500k btc per day.
If say volume would be 1m btc per day, then the usd equivalent volume would be 80bn$, approximatively.
So that means, a group of buyers would need to have a trading volume that averages half of the trading volume.
That means 20-40bn$ bought by buyers, in that 24h period. This, regardless of whether they sold in that same day.
Leveraging that sum by 2, the needed capital for a trading day that needs to be put on market to buy that, is 10-20bn$ per day.
A 10 day buying spree, with that buying volume, with no leverage, would equal 10 times the average buying volume in a day, which would equal to....
200bn$ - 400bn$ . In a 10 day period.
^ This, to keep an average trading volume.
For this to happen, a number of hedge funds, big banks, and possibly even central banks would be needed.
Of course, on a 10x leverage, and if you want it to be the peak, you can divide that by 10, resulting in 20-40bn$. 
And if, by happenstance someone would print around 20-40bn$ worth of usdt, it might be just enough.
As for when the central banks, really buy bitcoin and say goodbye to their 'national' currencies, that would be when one of them would buy 1tn$(25% of their officially declared balance sheet) worth of btc. So 2-4tn$ can push btc price at around 600k to 1mn$ per btc.
^ So, if 1 bitcoin goes to 1mn$, one can speculate if it's central bank adoption.
To answer the OP question:
- if 1bn$ flowed into btc, using current trading volume, between 5% to 20%, or 500$ to 2000$, considering 10k$ per btc average.
- if 1tn$ flowed into btc, it should be between 300k-600k per btc, but that number can vary.
The answer:
For 60k$:
- Around 200-400bn$ worth of usd, in 10 days trading volume.
- ^ With 10x leverage... 20-40bn$ worth of usd, to print it as the top
- 20-40bn$ worth of usdt used to buy bitcoin, also to print the top. 200-400bn$ worth of usd, to keep that as the average price, thus, 100-200bn$ usdt used to keep that price, considering 50% usd volume, 50% usdt volume.
- From 20-40bn$ to make it as top, to 200-400bn$ to keep that price up.
