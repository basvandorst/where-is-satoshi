The very first trade will be set on that listed price when it is listed?

Oh! That could be a point. No fee discount for large volume. Thanks!

Thank you so much for your kind explanation.
I would like to ask you more regarding your reply. 
1. Is that possible that nodes miss and same UTXOs are uploaded on mempool?
2. Is that also possible that miners create a block including 2 UTXOs in one block? ( regarding that part you said that full nodes can discard the block which is not valid)
3. If miners choose what to include in their blocks, it seems that it is likely that each miner is working on their own block which is different from others. Isn’t it inefficient that people are working on different blocks but only one longest block can last on the blockchain?

what if I buy with market price, another person sell with market price as soon as the coin get listed?
The price will be the listed price?

Is "Listed Price" matters only in "market order" not limit order? Thanks.
