To say "I toldja so" :) I promised people I would, and they doubted. Just keeping my end of the bargain.

How do I invest in life insurance policies because a lot of idiots like you are gonna end up killing themselves soon..... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:02:35
This is precisely why it won't take off.

I'm obviously speaking to those idiots who banked their life savings and lost it all. Obviously if you can afford to lose, I mean sure if you like the pain be my guest. But I personally don't make idiotic investments.

Better there than in a grave after I lost everything to imaginary money :)

I dunno, why don't you look at the popped bubble and tell me if that was ever fucking sustainable.

Nobody is going to take the time to learn about the blockchain. Maybe half of a percent of people. Do you honestly think Average Jim from Arkansas is going to invest time into researching which Crypto he wants to buy? Or is he gonna go about his life and just keep using the dollar? Use your head here. The average person is *not going to buy and use crypto*. They just aren't.

Not even close to the same thing.

Bullshit. You don't believe in this tech. You are holding because you want it to go up, so you can get rich quick, and then you're gonna fucking sell it all. You aren't in because you believe in it. Don't feed us that bullshit. You want profit and you're gonna cut and run. And you. Fucking. Know it.

It's uncharted and the average person is not going to invest the time or money to learn about alternative currency. The dollar is solid and backed by hundreds of years of actual, tangible value and practice. The average American can barely be bothered to vote, let alone learn an entire new way to buy milk at Walmart. It's just not gonna happen, man.
