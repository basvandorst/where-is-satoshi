Wow that is super-embarrassing, but I won't just delete the comment and pretend I didn't make a mistake. Editors need editors too! Thanks for the catch.&gt;&gt;just send them to me

Guessing ESL... confirmed!
OP: when distributing to a primarily English-language audience, have your work edited by a native speaker first. Next drawings you do, just send them to me first and I will happily edit for free. 
Spelling matters.

Well, I am putting my money where my mouth is. Opened a brokerage account today for the sole purpose of shorting the hell out of WU.

Your dad should know what an IPO is and this is a good description of one. The early investors, those who shoulder the most risk, make the most money. The difference with bitcoin is that anyone who has 20 bucks can invest early. And it its still early. But unlike an IPO/pre-IPO, you don't have to know the right people, or have so much in assets, or need a SecondMarket account, etc. Heck, you can just have your kid pay rent with bitcoin and you're in... that easy.


The protocol prevents this, and those who could change (and this would be near-impossible) it are mostly early investors. Why would they devalue their holdings? This is a really simplified answer; read up on the protocol for more detail.


This is the best question of the bunch. Someone with enough money could attempt to centralize the network by basically buying it out. Everyone has a price, right? That said, I will always keep some bitcoin at any price because I believe in the protocol. If Warren wants to make me rich by increasing the scarcity of coin by buying most of it up, so be it... at the end of the day it's just another reason to invest. Plenty of people put money into companies in the hopes that they will get bought up by a major player. If one bitcoin comes to be worth the same amount as a share of BRK.A, I will not be complaining!


There's never been anything like the Internet, either! Bitcoin is about more than the price or the markets. It's a whole new paradigm and the pricing is just one part of it--and is the sexiest, which is why the media focus goes there. If you don't believe in bitcoin long-term or are a daytrader, the daily price matters. If you believe in it long term and hold, the price really doesn't. It could go to $10 tomorrow and I will still have most of mine because I believe in the long-term success of the protocol.

So what? All it takes is some die-hards who believe in the protocol (I am one of them) to hold at any price. 
They can't "buy every bitcoin." That statement is flat-out wrong.
You really think Satoshi is going to sell to WU?

Much as I would like to see bay area, this is a great suggestion: go where gamblers are. Poker players love bitcoin!

These look so much cleaner than some of the others floating around. It's spot-on design--love it. I am going to use it in my work and encourage clients to adopt it as well!

Would like to see Coinbase as an option... I know it's usually around the bitstamp price, but if I am going too buy, it's nice to see exactly how much it is going to cost from the ticker. Currently using zeroblock and bitcoin paranoid. I really like the red and green arrow alerts that appear as notifications and also register vibrating alerts. I will keep an eye on this app!

This just now as well:
Ok so I'll go open up an account and see if these codes will translate into real bitcoin and then figure out what to do with them
Hope he figures it all out--it'd be nice to have him on board with the bitcoin enterprise.
