They're downvoting you because it's a joke on the sign and you're taking it literally.

But then she will have to fake covering her mouth with her hands in surprise like every other girl who ever got engaged! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:33:54
How did you arrive at that number? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:49:14
I laughed harder than I should've

This is so dumb. Stop being friends with someone because they don't listen to you about bitcoin? Lmao. Do you know how friendships work? Because for most people they don't work like, "Do as I say or else we're not friends anymore."

Yeah I assumed it's a bunch of pussy whipped men who feel lucky a woman even let's them fuck so they in turn let themselves be lorded over and whipped like a bitch. So then when they see a guy with a decent relationship where the woman actually respects the man they think it's some rare fantasy.

You're misinformed. If you're 100k in debt it would take most people in the US a lot longer than 5 years to pay that back. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:23:54
Student debt of under 20k is nothing.

Yep. You don't need your friends to do whatever you tell them to in order to be successful. You can have separate lives and make separate financial decisions and still be friends and hang out and have fun together. What are you talking about? Because this sounds like some psychopathic CEO bullshit.

Little fucking bitches
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:12
The joke is that the statement is hypocritical and ironic. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:12:01
Damn you guys are some bitter ass men. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:14:18
Read the thread you talked about and you were pretty disingenuous about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:10:45
If you are getting freaked out when all you've risked is $250... Not sure if you should be playing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:31:47
Ah, gotcha. I get that then.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:14:28
You should be living and enjoying your life too... What's the point in constantly living for the future? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:37:27
I haven't seen one post that says they're cashing out because thei car broke down. You're making up narratives and mad at nothing.

Honestly, as a newcomer to this sub but browsing heavily over the last few days, I'll tell you right now that the vast majority of you guys come across as children, or less hyperbolic, a typical socially weird basement dwelling internet tribe. The memes, the acronyms, the echo chamber, it comes across as very cult-like and most of you seem like complete weirdos. I say this to you because I support bitcoin and I want mass adoption. And I agree with OP. I don't think some of you guys realize how much of disservice you do for bitcoin by how this community comes across. This isn't a good community for information and discussion. It's a community where you guys just jack each other off in your secret club house and repeat the same jokes over and over again like boys at a slumber party. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:18
It's because it's a culture of mass conformity like you wouldn't believe. The nail that sticks out gets hammered in. Individualism is not celebrated like it is in the states. In fact, its looked down upon. I did not mix well with Korean culture living there. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:11:25
Probably with the cash of their national currency. I was actually asking you in seriousness though. How would you go about getting bitcoin without a bank account?? All I can think of is by accepting it as payment for goods/services and going from there? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:05:40
Why does seemingly everyone dude act like their wives are a major drag and would never do anything cool or nice? Damn guys. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:23:35
How will these 4 billion without bank accounts purchase bitcoin to begin with then? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:18:37
There are lots of different flavors of it. Many libertarians are simply socially libertarian and economically liberal. There's a libertarian left. Extremist ideology seems a bit... extreme. You're assuming all libertarians are extreme in their beliefs without nuance.

It doesn't matter if they understand it. They just have to save it.

Who cares. Fuck her. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:27:33
No, it's good you don't have more. It's just 20k is not a scary looming number like some people with 100-200k have hovering over them. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:55:09
Wow do you people actually advocate not living your life, not enjoying the now, not fucking, not drinking, not having fun and instead just obsessing over fucking bitcoin? Just insanity. It's called balance. You're not happier forgoing society and obsessing over Bitcoin. You're in a manic obsessive state and it's certainly not healthy.

I'm not actually an alcoholic. Just liked the sound of the username.

Ah so you're the jackass that sits on the sidelines of life, criticising and commenting on everything but never actually doing something. You're the movie critic in life instead of the actor. You're the sports commentator instead of the athlete. You're the guy with no stakes who can say whatever he wants because no matter what nothing will affect you. If it plummeted to 0 you'd say I told you so. If it rose to $30k you'd say "it's a bubble" again. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:44:53
You can't put a price on having a good time and enjoying life. You think people are crazy for spending money on beer? Live your life man. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:19:41
You act like you know whether it was the right choice or not right now. You don't. It might be, it might not. You don't know shit. You feel like it's the right choice *right now*. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:35:35
I don't know how you got "buying bitcoin is moral" from what I said. I'm just saying it's easy to sit on the sidelines and criticize everyone else.
