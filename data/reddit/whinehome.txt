Really great and sobering article. Its interesting that he left the comment section open just to showcase how bitcoin believers are zealots full of an almost religious-like fervor. It worked. Vijay must have spent all day debating in the comments section.

Yes of course. Kudos to all of you who bought bitcoin 6 months ago and saw their money go up 6 fold. And for early adopters they ended up with the best investment of their lifetime, even if its by accident. My point is that after this amazing 11,000% return nobody is going to advise you to buy.

No, not like gold. He specifically mentions gold and says that it is also a huge waste of energy and ultimately silly.

Him having a degree just lends some creedence to him understanding the technologum. Technology aside, I think anybody who has a good understanding of economics would agree that bitcoin is a bubble.

Oh yea if you had bitcoin from years ago you are laughing. But it would be crazy to expect that same growth from 14k

Whether its Bitcoin, stocks or other investments, its definietly a good idea to take your gains and pay off debt if you have it. Especially student debt that can feel like a burden and difficult to get ahead when establishing your career. Kudos on making a wise decision and being debt free!

Cramer might not be a great financial genius but he isn't wrong.
If you you spent $10,000 USD 1 month ago today...
And bought Exxon stock (largest oil producer) today you would have $10,400 USD
Or if you bought Boeing stock today you would have $11,516
If you bought Bitcoin... $7847.55
 
Who wants to own oil or planes when you could own imaginary money?!

Isn't GS launching their own crypto trading desk? Of course they are going to say cryptos are legitimate curency. They are going to make lots of money on day trading and fees. Lets see if they begin accepting cryptos for their fees to clients...

Where does coin market cap get all this data?
It seems crazy that over 600,000 BTCs have been traded today but only 11,000 on gdax. Gdax only makes up 2% of trades? Is gdax one of the smallest exchanges? Serious question.

Bitcoin fluctuates like crazy so its difficult to show a calculation because there is no market close price, but I'm not purposely fudging the numbers to make a point. On December 12 you would have bought somewhere between $16,850 and $17,750. Today you would have sold somewhere between $13,000 and $14,100.
Lets take the averages.
Buy $10,000 worth on Dec 12 at $17,350 =  0.576 BTC
Sell 0.576 at 13,550 on Jan 12 = $7804.80
If you bought on the daily high and sold at the daily low.
Buy $10,000 worth at $17,750 = 0.563 BTC
Sell 0.563 BTC at $13,000 = $7,319

Im not sure there are any sour grapes. The author isnt upset of suffering from FOMO, he just has a disciplined investment philosophy that he sticks to. He is also a computer engineer who studied crypto and read the white paper, so im not sure where the misunderstanding comes in... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:31
So bitcoin is going up because its scarce?
By contrast you could have also bought a 1oz Gold Coin in 2000 for $270 and sold it in 2012 for $1650. And in 2000 there was less gold above ground. Its going up and down because people believe in it or don't believe in it.

The dotcom bubble wasnt about companies overspending but being over-valued.
For example when investors believed that everything on the internet was the future they rushed in to buy stocks. Pets.com  had a market cap (the value of all its stocks) of $300,000,000 on revenue of $600,000. 
Bitcoin has a market cap (the value of all its coins) of $294,000,000,000 and revenue of $0.
Make do with what information as you will. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:32:04
Also 0. Putting all your money into gold would also be unproductive.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:18:25
And if you bought a 1oz gold coin 5 years ago today it would have cost you $1,700 USD. Today you could sell that coin for $1,241.
Its another non productive asset that people feel isn't worth as much today. If bitcoin slowly declines from 17,000 to 12,500 over the next 5 years everybody on this sub would be freaking out.

It sounds like you can't afford to lose $500 if it means your family isn't going to have a Christmas.
You're up 25% by sheer luck. 
Take your $625 and buy your children Christmas presents and take your wife out to dinner.

Perhaps gambling is too strong a term, but its certainly speculating.
Too many people on this reddit are conflating understanding the technology with understanding the investment. Just because someone else has done research and they feel they "get bitcoin" (whatever that means), it doesn't mean they have a special view into the market and behaviour of investors.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:19:55
Any sort of economic news is a conspiracy against bitcoin!

Why does every bitcoin hodler use gold as the analogy?
Gold hasn't been on some unending increase like bitcoin has. Gold topped out at like $1800 USD/oz in 2011 and down to about $1050 in 2016 and has since risen but not back up to its peak price. That's a 40% drop. 
Lets assume bitcoin mirrors gold and this is the top. By 2022 Bitcoin will be about $10,200. Its still a store of value but you've lost nearly $7000. Which is totally fine, just make sure you're cool with your bitcoins going down $7000 too.
So why did people buy beanie babies?

Except the bitcoin hodler didnt buy coca cola stock like people advised, they bought a six pack of coke every other week when they got their paycheck and hoarded it. Saying "Im holding onto this delicious beverage! Obviously when the system crashes people will be coming to me begging to buy this mountain of coke and Ill be rich! I could easily see each bottle being worth millions in a few years. You dont understand soda! Its a new type of drink that will change everything. I might mortgage my house and buy a whole van full!"
Then Pepsi came along. Then RC Cola. Then Buzz Cola. 
But its not Coke! Said the hodler.

And Draper's other notable big investment was Theranos, a fraud that cost investors billions of dollars. This dude is an idiot with a shitty track record.

You're looking at the wrong perspective.
Who is this mysterious business that is going to go out of their way to exchange their revenue/profits from dollars to bitcoin so they can pay their part-time 15 year old employee? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:48:04
They are. That's exactly why its 6.8k
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:09:50
This doesnt make sense. Youre paying capital gains tax on your...capital gains. If you made say 100k of profit from selling your bitcoins and you owe 25k of that portion in taxes you're still up 75k. Why would you need to sell anything else? Youve already made the gain that triggered the tax.

The best part is that this chart was posted at least every week for the past 2 months and the BTC HOLDERS were so dismissive.  "IT'S NOT A BUBBLE! You/Warren Buffet/Richard Thaler/[insert nobel prize winning economist] just don't understand economics!"

Well they are born between 1980 and 2000, so the upper bracket of millennials are in their 30s this year. Some are 38!

I think lots of people without BTC come here to gawk. Its entertaining to watch the reactions to a bubble in real time. Like a study in market psychology and irrational behaviour.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:59:44
I agree. The curiosity is more about watching bubble psychology in real time. Not just having an archive of everyone's delusions but like the hourly play-by-play as they respond to the market.
But yea it could be any bubble really. I'd be creeping the Beanie Babyz reddit if it was 2005 too.
