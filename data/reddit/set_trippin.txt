Problem is that I'm generally interested in market caps sub $1b and I don't know if Gemini fits that description. Scary times for a lot of Kraken users it seems. I've recommended them in the past in terms of security but I guess the support leaves something to be desired.

It's unfortunately dead. One of the most recent topics is about DAO trading.

In my case it was sending them XRP w/o a tag b/c I didn't know about tags, which to their credit they've made right for many other ppl in the past. So it sent the XRP to Kraken in general but w/o routing it to the correct account. I even bought the XRP there at Kraken, lol. Sincerely, I wish you luck

let us know about your resolution if/when it comes

13 days for me so far. Nothing yet. And it's a serious matter, too. I'll gladly leave an update here if I ever do get my money.

I'm concerned that right now they are simply focused on whatever investigation they might be under instead of focused on anything resembling the customers first approach the financial world commands. With my Schwab account the matter would have been settled in minutes.

I didn't want it to come to this and have been patient and polite. But we're at about two weeks. I'll update this accordingly, though.

Good to know. Thanks for keeping us posted/supporting transparency.

Poloniex screwed me over BIG TIME. That's why I'm dealing with Kraken. Maybe should have just left crypto period, after years of being in this. I've lost count of how many exchanges have scammed me, even if I am normally in cold storage.

I think more transparency would be good. A basic statement like "We're sorry, but we just weren't prepared for so many requests" or "We just need a little time to play with your funds but we're not Goxing you" would be good. ANYTHING.

Well, we've known for years the uptick would happen.

I'm glad they could at least verify someone. Been there, done that. In my case, which is to do w/ money being owed to me, the support ticket was opened before that and there are still zero responses to something that could be handled in a couple of minutes. So, if at all, tickets aren't being answered in order. This is hell.

Issue resolved!
