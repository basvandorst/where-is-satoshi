I'm fairly sure they drive Roadsters on Mars.

If someone tells me it’s not a tale a Jedi would tell me I’m going to force choke a bitch.

A cruelty horcrux, as it were.

Hat isn't that scalable, and have you seen the transaction fees on getting one?

In 2048 always-on wireless devices the size of a thumb drive, with fingerprint authentication will be a reality. Hell, that thing might power itself with piezoelectric or momentum transfer. 
Think about where we were 30 years ago... and we're only moving faster.

This is a great suggestion. It would be nice if we could use post flair to filter out the meme stuff - no disrespect to the memefolk, but there are times when I'd prefer to just drill down to stuff I find more interesting and beneficial.

You get me. Qi charging, AirPower, all of these things are going to evolve - near field induction, hell - Tesla's dream might be the ticket in the next 30 years.

Fox. We make great sci-fi shows, for one season.

I was just a guest interviewed on CTV in Vancouver about Bitcoin (there's a woman selling her car here for BTC) and I mentioned this.
The segment should be on the six o'clock news, hope I did y'all proud.

It's funny, I was in a meeting about a year ago where a rep from Panasonic Canada said "How can we use QR codes in our marketing strategy". 
A co-worker and I chimed in simultaneously: "You can't!"
The long and the short of it is that QR codes aren't transactionally friendly. The never have been; they're too slow. Even Apple's implementation of gift card code recognition is a bit too slow - standing in a Starbucks scanning a card feels awkward. 
OP is 100%. BTLE is the way to go. There's your trendy marketing name: Beetle. Go forth and make it, developers.

Fair enough... Apparently the guy who just posted a video posted an old gore clip, but nonetheless wouldn't it be better for us to simply say "that shit isn't welcome here"?

The Canada Goose is unintimidated by bullshit... or anything else. Mean motherfuckers, those things.

Right? Apparently it's an old video... as if that makes it better? Hard pass on this stuff.

I'm under the impression that you're not supposed to eat the skin, it's high in fat.

From what I understand some Germans dig cannibalism. 
And Sweden? Nothing I own is flat packed, so no.
Denmark? I saw Hamlet, once. Also no.

As someone who literally just had his tonsils out at an age far older than recommended, eating scabs is a sensitive subject for me. 
P.S. you're gross.

It’s also shit for making phone calls. Let’s have some fucking perspective here.

If it's any consolation it's not showing cake for you here.
Hmm. In retrospect I doubt that's very consoling.

I don't think it's cheerleading to say thank you for sharing your experience and advice. Solid guidance from people who have been there and done that is what will help democratize the access to BTC for ordinary people. So thank you.

And all this time I thought a fire sale was a terrible plot point in Die Hard 4. This makes more sense, though it does point out something sorely lacking in the bit coin world: cool guys walking away from explosions.
