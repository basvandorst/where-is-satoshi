They have about 10x the volume as Mt.Gox
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:45:11
Nevermind, its nice seeing that 1.0000 BTC in that motherfucker
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:11:04
I just received mine now. Took about 20 hours. Now just waiting for at least a little drop
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:16:46
I was wondering about that too
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:09:55
144!!! new high!!!
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:16:46
Depends in your where you live, for your platform. Where are you ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:32:55
How did you deposit funds to LibertyBit? If you used EMT how long did it take for it to show up in your LB account?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:58:46
trying to buy in at libertybit but they are nothing compared to mt.gox
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:07:38
15000 USD?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:50:04
....as I posted, of course!
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:20:13
GIC are about 3 and 3quarters % but it is still a more viable option than cash or BTC!
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:12:39
thats truely rough. i was waiting for funds to clear, but as soon as i saw BTC shoot up like that there was no way it would stay there. I waited until now for a decent price
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:39:12
LibertyBit is good for Canada. Email interact money transfers for $2.00 n takes about a day.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:14:58
The bulls are Baaaack in town 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:40:27
had a buy at 75 now im not sure i want it
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:31:07
why LibertyBit for Canadians vs other methods?
@_date: 2013-07-31 20:14:30
Not having much luck as I'm in Canada. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:10:06
He's already fucking you in the ass
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:06:14
yeah but then how to get the funds back to Mt.Gox for cheaper buying?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:04:12
I just registered with LibertyBit, and as a Canadian you can send interac email money transfers for $2.00. Waiting on the money to appear in my bit account to get started. Been pretty easy 
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:08:08
Definitely going to hit the 3000 mark within 2 weeks. Guaranteed. Without a doubt.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:03:01
Yeah Im thinking buy in at LibertyBit then transfer to a wallet, then transfer BTC into MTgox and trade away
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:22:13
I'd honestly stay away from Mt grow and bitcoin24. Haven't heard great things from either. I'd try campBX 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:14:51
Is it possible/good to deposit in one website, and transfer to another account on another site to trade?
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:41:43
10 times a day? Start worrying when you have tabs on the price all day!!
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:32:16
Time to get back in 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:10:11
Couldnt actually tell you to be honest. There has been 10 trades in USD in the past 2 weeks total. I am working in CAD
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:21:55
because there are more stable things you can put the "worthless paper" in than virtual currency
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:31:47
Certainly a feasible idea
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:11:36
just watching this fall happen, waiting for it to go a bit more
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:11:14
Even the amount of CAD being traded on Gox is tiny 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:45:57
lucky for me Im not at Mt. Gox and now their lag is almost 3 minutes and the price is back up to 140
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:17:13
What price did you get in at ?
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:22:40
low was 66
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:23:30
I'm no miner but by the looks if the market the past few days 50/BTC would be a good price to get in at. Still going to wait a while before jumping in on a drop
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:36:56
i was thinking about doing this too
but sometimes sites take an hour or more to move the funds
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:01:15
metals, bonds, GIC?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:29:29
I just added 130 to my account. Waiting for a little dip before securing my coins
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:37:02
Why not just take out smaller amounts each time ?
@_date: 2013-07-31 16:31:04
Any tips for using localbitcoins? I've heard PayPal isn't the safest way to sell BTC
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:11:36
Everyone responsible is nodoubedtly subscribed to this subreddit 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:00:07
the tiniest one; LibertyBit. Its good for selling because it is on average $7-10 per BTC higher than MT
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:52:42
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:49:27
Back to 160.
LibertyBit sold some BTC as high as 190 earlier
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:13:14
Yeah they have 40 BTC in traded with USD and 4500 BTC in CAD
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:53:10
Maybe you should
