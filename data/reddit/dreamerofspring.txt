OP is excited and thinks the authorities in Iran are competent in running things and will help bitcoin. let me tell you what happened. some people were mining btc with cheap industrial electricity. government seized their miners. they forbid using cheap industrial electricity for mining and stated that export price will be applied to miners. then some ayatollahs stated mining to be kinda haram (not explicitly) and vice president of central bank stated trading it to be illegal (although there is no law regarding crypto and multiple websites are doing trade) to put pressure on ordinary people but there are reports that government backed organizations are mining in mosques with free electricity.
this is not strange in Iran. 
state an ambiguous statement or interpretation of an ambiguous law or fatwa or... 
put pressure on ordinary people. 
let your thugs benefit.

the ones that take current things as eternal are more likely to stay in that year than the ones who ask a question
btw Lightning isn't even a perfect answer for my question

thanks. that's informative.
but the big tech companies are entering the game. Telegram, Facebook,... everyone makes their own coin.
I know they are not really gonna be independent from governments, etc but common people don't always choose the right thing.
people choose the cheaper and more convenient option. 
if they can make transactions easy to do for my dead grandma how can bitcoin convince her otherwise?

They already have a big bitcoin mining facility with free electricity and internet (from people's pocket)
