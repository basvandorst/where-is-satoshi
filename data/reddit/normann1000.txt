Must be a swedish thing. I used Swedbank Estonia to wire money to Bitstamp 3 weeks ago. Everything went through as usual.

You sound like a banker who hates bitcoin. I suggest you zoom out on btc charts. For past 10 years btc has only gone up yet you say btc was crashing till 2017. Now look at "kings" purchasing power chart over the past 100 years. Now tell us again how fiat is "king". ��

Law Enforcement cant seize bitcoin at their own will. Only way they can confiscate them is if you give up your passwords and seeds.

Bisq or Bitstamp to buy btc and Atomicdex for atomic swaps.

No. We are still in a bear market. We are not making higher highs, moving averages are pointing down on higher timeframes and seems like market cycles are getting longer with each cycle.

Look, I get it. Not everyone gets the point what BTC is for. Its not here to take down fiat. Its a alternative way to opt-out from the current ponzi fiat system. You dont have to use BTC. You can be a gold bug or use fiat. I dont really care.  I opted out long time ago and well so far it has been paying off.
 Im not a maximalist and im being realistic here. You dont need to be tech savvy to use and store bitcoin. Few google searches and little bit of research and you are good to go. Once you get used to it, it works the same as current banking system. Only with less middle men.
If governments wanted to take down btc they would have done it a long time ago when btc was in its infancy. Decentralization is a wonderful thing. There is no weakest link in decentralization.

No its not. Buy a hardware wallet or use a Brain wallet.


Gold isnt easily transported. Try going past a security gate with bar of gold. Also you need a god damn armored truck to transport larger quantities and use very expensive insurance. You can carry your bitcoins on a piece of paper.


No, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. All your examples are from criminals who traded their bitcoins for lesser jail time. 5$ wrench attack wont work if you use a multisig wallet. 


Yes, many have better tech than bitcoin but it isnt a zero sum game where one coin rules them all. One network ,many chains is the endgame here.


Bitcoin is the worlds most well performing asset known to man. It went from 0.0003$ to 19K$ in 8 years. Also you are comparing a 10 000 year old asset to a 10 year old asset.  


Miners dont control the network. They just process and validate transactions. Thats all. They have no control over bitcoin. 51% attack needs billions $ in hardware and for what? to reorg 6 blocks? Also why would miners bite the hand that feeds them?


There is no civil war. Bitcoin forks are not Bitcoin. All forks have different properties and use-cases. Forks are just parallel chains because people have different opinions about bitcoin.

Thats not how margin works. Lets say you go long (buy) at 7200$ with 5x leverage. Price moves to 7500$. Thats 4% move in price. Since you used 5x leverage you made 20% profit depending on your position size. 
Now lets say price didnt move in your favour and dropped to 7000$. Thats 2.77% in price movement. With 5x leverage your loss now is 13.85% depending on the position size.
Hope this helps a bit.

Then we watch as some exchanges go under like Canadian exchange Quadra last year.

When Proof of Keys happens most people withdraw their coins from the exchange. If that exchange is running on fractional reserve ( they show tokens as balance not real coins) then that exchange goes bust because that exchange doesnt have all the coins they claim they do. 
Proof of keys is similar to a bank run.

Because little bits of coin make a whole coin when collected enough.
