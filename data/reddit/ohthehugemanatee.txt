Thanks for the recommend, I just had a look there and signed up for an account. The rates are great, but the security is TERRIBLE. 
* [Qualys' SSL tester]( grades their site as an "F". There are highly visible vulnerabilities that date from 2008!
* Their PIN code system has been out of date since about the same time. How can a financial services company not offer _any_ modern authentication systems? No token generation, no YUBIkey, not even SMS verification. They email you a 3-digit code which is supposed to be your security. The authentication process is written in a way that means they must be storing the full PIN in plaintext. Email. 3 digit secret. Stored in plaintext. Shocking.
* They restrict your password length. 20 Characters is a fine password length at the moment, but the fact that the site architect is limiting password length strongly implies two things: 1) S/he doesn't understand the basics of password-based security, and 2) they are storing your password in a system that is length limited, ie one that gives away at least the length of your password. _This is very likely to be plaintext._ 
Totally shocking. They look like a legitimate business and they have a great service to offer, so I emailed them about this. No one should submit their financial information to an online system with such poor security. It's just dangerous. It would be trivially easy to spoof every client into wiring money to the wrong place, or to authorizing a bad transaction.
I'm writing so that you and anyone else who is interested in the site knows what to check before ever running financial transactions through them.  I advise everyone to stay away from this site until these basic issues are fixed.
* Check their [SSL security]( 
* Check that they allow unlimited length passwords.
If you want security on par with any of the major Bitcoin services, also check that they permit the use of modern, secure authentication systems. Almost anything other than their current "3 digits we show you and 3 digits we email you" system would be an improvement.
Again, thanks for the recommend. But this is not a system to be used in its' present state. It's an invitation to a phishing program.
