@_date: 2014-08-31 12:41:33


Bitcoin is still a currency but some people doesn't see this. They think that the only thing you can do with BTC is investment

Nice reference dude
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:38:43


Funny that obvious things just like this should be explained to people. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:58:08
They are used to act like a flattery guys but the fact is they are kinda snakes. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:38:17

@_date: 2014-09-07 10:04:15
I can't understand why your comment is downvoted.
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:02:42
Max Kaiser seems to be clever, uh? Btw, that 2% of the population is a really big number of humans (it's half of America)
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:18:02
You are right. Can't understand why you are downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:28:44

Good decision, man!
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:04:25

@_date: 2014-08-09 13:24:45

There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin adoption. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:40:22
Ok. everybody understood that punchline should be a title. Stop it please
@_date: 2014-09-07 10:17:45
What about the new Alfa Romeo 4C? Seriously asking. Want to say something? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:59:00


No it won't. Bitcoins have a lot of ways to change the current system. Don't even compare it with a traditional bank system. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:56:53
Maybe it's a bad news for today that U.S. Bank JP Morgan denied an alternative payment system, but don't forget guys that what doesn't kill us - make us stronger.
@_date: 2014-09-07 10:03:24

This is a real deal. As I know there is no taboo to use Bitcoin in this countries.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:16:42

Should we vote for it? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:19:45


The moral of the story is simple. Do not keep your personal photos and vids on the cloud.
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:57:18
You can google for some. They really do.
@_date: 2014-09-07 08:07:53

The Economist is not a great magazine but since this article i'm about to change my mind
@_date: 2014-08-09 08:42:24
Wow! You must really worry about your bitcoins being stolen. And that small message "it's over" is really creepy. I've never actually screamed out loud from a dream before but I have been startled a few times and I jumped in my bed.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:20:30
Yes, maybe the great user interface is the key, but you shouldn't ignore the words of the president. He is right by the way. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:28:43


It's ok. Everything should be a little bit risky. It is the thing which keep the economy going
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:13:20
Good advice, haha!

@_date: 2014-09-06 12:15:22
Funny that you are right 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:30:49


Yes, you are right but thé fact is that à huge number of unique addresses never sounds good. Especially if we are working with "anybody". Got it?
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:38:41


That's the reason they keep it happening 
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:03:34
Yeah, it's ok for people to change his mind, because, you know - market economy, changes in politics and personal preferences can make you even a friend of your enemies
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:54:40
There is no anarchism, you know. The only thing that you can find here is some humor.

@_date: 2014-08-13 09:04:24
Anyone in a Big Business accepting bitcoin to convert it to dollars. Because it's their goals in our capitalistic world.
