I upgraded using instructions on the ppa thread and ended up with a developer version 16.99 I think. Is there any instructions on how to go back? I'm on Linux.

 I think they pay out in bitcoin.

I went and bough this one. Used the same bit(carbide) it came with.
For sure there may be cheaper sheets out there.

Links to pictures of items used. Bought them all at home depot. 
Handy Box Cover Blank .57 cents 
1 x 1 Foot Weldable Steel Sheet $7.24  There may be cheaper sheets out there. As someone pointed out these are rather thin and may melt at lower temps. A thicker sheet is recommended if you are worried about a fire. 
  x 1/2 Inch Flathead Screws w/nuts $1.18 ((The ones shown are zinc. I went back and found some steel ones but with nuts in separate bag.))  
Grand Total of $10.35 
Engraver goes for about $15 on amazon. First ask your uncle or a friend that may have one laying around. Same for the snips.
