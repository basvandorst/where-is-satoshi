Do you have the link for the beta?

This whole thing is off because I had a small issue a week ago, contacted support and within an hour everything was completely fixed. I was more then impressed with support. But now that I am having an issue with an escrow refund it is as if there is no one operating crypto thrift.
It has been 4 days without any word whatsoever on my escrow refund request or my tickets.

blockchain.info wallet. Is it really going to take a week?

In that case I just hope the coin goes up in value to subsidize the loss of not being able to use that money

If I don't hear back today then I will.
I have bumped the ticket 4 or 5 times already :/
I need that bitcoin right now too so it sucks
What can ya do

Seems really unprofessional for a legitimate business if this really is a common occurrence

What happened with them?
I remember a few months ago they were talking about being completely ready by early 2015.
Then nothing

Can anyone tell me how to add an extra fee to my transactions so they send? Ill tip a few bucks for the help

Blockchain.info is just so much easier to use. Can anyone recommend a certain transaction fee that should work? I was using 0.004.
I hate to go back to trezor. Thing breaks every few weeks.
