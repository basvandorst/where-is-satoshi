I wonder if this bubble will turn out to be like the double-bouble 2013. We went to $230, a few month bear market, then up to $1100. Maybe this is what's happening, just on a lot longer time scale. We went to 20K, maybe we'll go to 100K in a year~

Did you get these sats from mining?

I really would love for it to go to $87, I could buy a lot of BTC

might be a dumb question... but whats a fuacet?

If there's no one that will buy it for you or exchange it for something, than the only other option is mining (exchange crypto u get from mining for BTC)

I feel like litecoin should be higher than just $50 after being here for so long

I use Exodus, it has a friendly user interface and can be setup for backup. It's a desktop wallet.

I would, but I used all my money to buy BTC at 10.3K yesterday to hodl

What were the prices it happened at in 2014/15?

People treat it that way because on bitcoin's way up to becoming a real, used currency, they are able to get a lot of money. It's something that will change the world, and can make a lot of people very rich at the same time.

I hate how it was named that. It's like they knew a load of people were gonna get confused and send BTC to a BTC Cash address, or buy BTC Cash not knowing it isn't BTC

I say we go down to 6.5K and bounce up to 7K then start a new Accumulation phase there

What about the one in early 2013? Where it went to $230? 1st cycle it went to $30 2nd it went to $230 3rd it went to $1100, 4th it went to $20,000
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:56:42
But during first part of the 2013 bull run, around April I think, it went from $230 down to $50. That's over a 75% during the bull market, which doesn't really make it a bull market. It's just a very quick bear market cycle.
