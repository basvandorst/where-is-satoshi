@_date: 2018-06-25 12:58:55
Look, why don't you just make a thread here and on r/finance or something and see what people have to say. I've been quite generous  in attempting to explain this stuff to you.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:44:12
We're talking about economic principles not specific things you think might be beneficial over a 12 month period. For your own sake, these are things that you should do some thinking about.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:55:46
I address this in the last sentence of my post.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:12:02
this is exactly what i'm talking about. people shouldn't be pressured by this kind of thinking. it's a great way to lose your shirt.
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:26:50
Sure. Bitcoin is not a store of energy. It has no fair value.

i'm male. hope you're buying now.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:11:58
It sets the price at which it's profitable to sell but it does not set demand or the price at which they might sell.
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:51:32
The miners' cash on hand does not dictate the price of bitcoin. You don't have to take my word on this stuff, but everything I've said is true and for your sake I recommend you seek out some economists or finance managers you trust and see what they have to say about what we've discussed.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:42:50
this is interesting. got any good links for more info?
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:24:15
Demand can drop to 0 regardless of supply.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:09:39
it wouldn't be a store of value in fiat, but it would still be a store of value in bitcoin though, right?
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:24:00
why do you say it has $5k inherent value?
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:16:31
Yeah, tried to politely explain to him but he isn't having it i guess.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:34:00
Hope your money's in bitcoin, bud. Keep it in there. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:19:27
There is no fundamental backing to stop pricing from going lower.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:14:48
exactly, hopefully bitcoin goes to zero.
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:19:36
right. the cost of electricity to mine a bitcoin does not create a bottom for the price.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:52:03
They won't keep mining if that's the case.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:02:30
Nothing in the original post is misleading.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:36:25
Could you explain the good argument in detail so we can examine the merits then?
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:26:31
Okay, so not inherent then. Those qualities may indeed help the price rise again based on people's perceptions, but there's also no fundamental value to the coin and nothing to stop it from dropping further.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:54:55
i think i'm waiting until it drops below $50. will be able to buy much more then.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:52:20
Production cost does not create the lowest selling price. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:36:36
$0. It's not measurable in energy.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:23:41
That's not correct. You are assuming that market demand could not continue to drop at a time when market demand is plummeting. It's also worth keeping in mind that a situation in which miners stop mining will be disastrous for bitcoin's image and bitcoin's image (public perception) determines its price. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:47:33
there's not really any way to know whether it's a good time to sell or not. there aren't any fundamentals to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:31:40
The argument could be made that all buying and selling of Bitcoin is equally ridiculous because there's nothing fundamentally supporting a given price.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:39:09
Great, I totally believe you. Even dumb people get lucky sometimes.
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:19:36
No, my point is factual. It's not really something that can be reasonably argued.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:34:32
Just trying to explain market principles and help people. Not everyone will be receptive.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:28:31
Ask r/bitcoin then. Ask anyone who you think might have some reasonable authority on the topic. Otherwise, I'm done being charitable with you and I hope you put all your money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:38:59
isn't the goal to get rid of fiat though?
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:40:55
No, I get it perfectly well. You should read what I'm saying and actually think about it before implying that I don't.
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:44:16

@_date: 2018-06-24 16:38:16
That's dependent on demand. It does not create a floor.

Cool dude, nice to see all the money you've supposedly made has helped you achieve a calm and pleasant demeanor.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:28:48
It's implied by the term 'inherent value.'
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:18:43
There's no natural and constant demand.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:59:45
why do you think that?
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:05:01
Seriously. Ask around make a thread here and on r/finance. You don't want to hear it from me and that's fine. Maybe someone else can get through to you.
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:37:01
We're not talking about industries or consistent cases. We're talking about a specific asset. What's consistent is that demand dictates price. There's an abundance of instances in which producers or retailers sell goods below their incurred cost in order to minimize losses.

do you think it's weird at all to address my anti (or simply non-affirmative) stance on bcoin to personal deficiencies? that seems oddly dismissive and non-conducive to the pursuit of knowledge and actionable insights. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:03:43
you were the one who compared my dissuasive performance to the performance of bitcoin. i was just explaining why your measurement there was inaccurate, not suggesting you were making a good comparison. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:35:31
correct, except about me not being serious about wanting to help people. you tried to shift the frame of comparison to support pro-bcoinism, but when i explained why doing so didn't make sense, you said the comparison was stupid. and you were right, but it was also you that made the comparison.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:17:43
it's simply not correct to say that i've ignored replies and attempting to brand me as a paid shill is lazy argumentation. i've engaged you in conversation and presented questions that i think are valuable and instructive. i have nothing against you personally, so i hope that you will return to our conversation and think about the questions and issues i've presented and whether or not there are sound responses to them.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:12:08
there's surely some overlap between those groups. the last thing the people in those tough positions need is to lose what savings they have in bcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:45:50
well what exactly is your observation as it pertains to bcoin? if all you're saying is that passion is an element in human developments, that would seem to be a platitude and one that's not particularly helpful in looking at the issues at hand. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:21:38
what is the observation as it pertains to bitcoin and does that observation provide any actionable insights?
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:05:54
pay the bitcoin. you talk about being a better person, pay the bitcoin. otherwise it will haunt you and you will know in your soul for the rest of your life that you are a dishonest and slimy worm and the affects of that will be much more damaging to you then the monetary ones you should own up to. pay the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:32:14
so are you saying anything outside of:
"do your own research, while keeping in mind the basic competitive gambling tactic of buying low and selling high, and not investing/gambling more than you can afford to use."?
i think we're both losing sight of what your argument is. those are basically just platitudes, right? 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:31:23
it has a lot to do with that. it's one more piece of data in a huge sea of data points that suggests that bcoin is propped up by hype, weird emotions, and horse video game posts.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:27:37
i'm a simple person, why don't you just explain it in clear terms and we can measure the extent to which your observation is correct or valuable based on future performance?
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:49:12
alright, let's do it:
i don't have any bcoin, and i want to help people here get out of a dead 'asset.'
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:26:07
it would probably make more sense to track performance across similar periods of activity.
for example, i begin actively warning people about bcoin as it's coming up to and reaching its peak last year. granting your premise that i haven't managed to save anyone from big losses, my success rate is 0% over that time period.
meanwhile, bcoin's performance over that time period is -80%.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:37:52
it doesn't make sense to criticize what i've presented as overly broad, common, or not based on deep understanding and then present 'buy low, sell high' etc. as valuable or prescient advice. it's good in its simplicity, but it's not actionable because you don't know what low and high are going to be with an asset that's as removed from fundamentals as bcoin. 
if you want to stake a clear position on the future performance of bcoin relative to its current cash value over a given period of time and compare it to my position, that is something that we can do. but the argumentation i've given has generally been sound, well presented, and cordial, even if you personally don't agree with the content, so attempting to characterize it with abstract moral frameworks doesn't work in service to the discussion.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:59:34
why are you suggesting that offering my takes on bcoin is bad or not positive or characterizing that activity or its point of motivation as scared or defensive? 
i'm offering my perspective here as i have to those i know in real life because it's my honestly held position on bcoin. this action has been helpful to people i know personally, but even if we remove that sort of background element from what i'm saying, it doesn't make sense to characterize the content of what i'm presenting in terms of 'goodness' or 'positivity.' 
an affirmative position on bcoin does not equal a 'positive' outcome. recognizing that, you would have to describe what i'm presenting as neutral. not neutral in the sense that i don't have a stance on whether bcoin will go up or down, but neutral in the sense that it doesn't really exist within the frames of 'goodness' 'badness' or 'positivity.' if we want to measure the performance of my position against competing positions, that is something we can do, but the positions themselves are not really subject to the kind of moral framework you're suggesting.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:41:25
you're looking deeply at who i am? what insight do you have there and what can you tell me about me? seems kinda odd. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:26:04
we can start here and jump around:
"curiouscitizen100 1 point 4 hours ago 
So bcoin is less secure at $4,000 than it was at $19,500. Does that make it less valuable, which in turn makes it less secure, which in turn should spiral bcoin to 0?
nomofiat 1 point 4 hours ago 
Yes this could happen. Bitcoin is not exactly a 0 risk investment.
There's plenty of people wishing for it to go to 0. They have often been hoping and shilling for $0 since $100. Since what price have you been dismissing bitcoin? How does it feel?
Why do you come here to waste your time on something you clearly dislike on an emotional level? You are not here to learn, nothing will ever change your mind. So what is your angle? why are you here?"
you didn't address the concept that we arrived at here -- that being, that the price of bitcoin determines its functionality within the realm of "immutability" -- a characteristic which you have ascribed particular value to in relation to the "immutability" of other bchains. Ex:
"nomofiat 1 point 8 hours ago* 
a high price makes the network more secure."
what you did do was sidestep the dynamic outlined previously by admitting that bcoin losing value is a possibility. obviously that's a possibility, but what we were discussing was bcoin having less "immutability" (what you've presented as a key determinant in value, but also a key result of increased value) as prices drop. so, the dynamic that should have been addressed was: 
bcoin price drops &gt; immutability drops &gt; bcoin price drops &gt; cycle continues.
rather than actually addressing the dynamic that you set up, you moved to being personally dismissive and questioning my motivations. people are welcome to do so, but that type of thinking/argumentation will not help us get closer to determining where bcoin is headed, and people should at least be willing to engage with and flesh out the dynamics that they present if they are serious in their endeavors. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:58:14
oh okay, but in the analogy, you are a Dr. of bcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:53:36
i don't test for it. that would require an Erlenmeyer flask and a copy of Origin of Species, right? 
it's a value judgement based on observed characteristics. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:46:31
what are you talking about? can you explain how that makes sense, if not to me, then at least to yourself?
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:14:21
not sure why you would characterize my advice as 'mediocre at best.' we'll have to measure my current anti-bcoin stance against future performance, but the advice i've presented has been helpful to at least three people in my life and i'm presenting my position here at no charge for anyone who would like to read it. if it proves helpful, either in encouraging behavior in relation to the relative price movements of bcoin or in encouraging people to at least temporarily approach their strategies from a different perspective, i would be satisfied with the effort. if not, it's enjoyable conversation and i can say that i tried and staked out a clear position that others were free to either take or leave as they please.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:26:19
it's a good sign bcoin is overvalued when people are posting about naming their horse bcoin in video games.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:54:19

you're scientisming again.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:31:22
this is your last chance to buy at $19,500 before it moons and lumbos!
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:57:20
right. you made a comment that was unsupportable, i took one avenue in showing why it was not a very good comment, and then you said that your comment was stupid in the first place, and then i agreed.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:40:04
yeah, that is basically what i'm saying. think about it for the next half hour and maybe it will make sense.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:39:46
no, i gave advice at a given point in the past (avoid bcoin at X price) and i'm giving advice currently -- avoid bcoin at its current price. we can measure how that turns out over a specified time period. are you giving the advice to buy bcoin at its current price? if so, why are you giving that advice? if not, why aren't you giving that advice?
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:38:37
i usually look for poorly understood or misapplied scientific concepts or overly reverential conceptions of "science" used to construct or support a given position. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:22:23
how are you measuring the relative notion of value if not by price? i am referring to value as it is reflected by price (past, present, and future) as i think most people who buy bcoin are. if you return to what i'm saying with that reasonable framework, it should make sense. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:32:56
because you have to compare the performance of things over similar time periods in order to effectively measure it. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:16:48
are you making a supportable point there or is that just a platitude?
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:21:41
So bcoin is less secure at $4,000 than it was at $19,500. Does that make it less valuable, which in turn makes it less secure, which in turn should spiral bcoin to 0?
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:45:44
It makes a lot of sense. What doesn't make sense is comparing bcoin to gasoline. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:58:26
i started actively warning people about bcoin when it was peaking last year, and went extra hard when it was peaking at $19,500.
even if i haven't convinced anyone to get out, it's very unlikely i've convinced anyone to get in. 
granting your premise, i've had a 0% positive impact on people leaving bcoin over the last year, while bcoin is down about 80% over the period. so, while i may not have succeeded in helping anyone save their money, my 0% performance over the last year would have to be described as better than the -80% performance of bcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:10:38
okay, and that's exactly why bcoin is overvalued. the people who are in it think they are Doctors of Bcoin but can't make a good case for why bcoin should go up rather than down under any real scrutiny and are too hyped up by the thoughts of lumbos and bcoin horse video games to think critically about the positions they hold. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:04:02
re-read. you tried to go down that road until you got bounced.
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:29:47
the contents of that comment chain.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:40:35
what distinction are you making between a currency and a money?
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:54:28
this is more scientism that isn't helpful in attempting to draw projections for the future performance of bcoin. if you want to say that monetary value is divorced from real value, you will have a hard time making the case for why bcoin should maintain or increase its current $ value. you've indicated that it doesn't matter what happens to bcoin in the future. that's something that can be said, but that sort of divorced, philosophical stance is not useful for the vast majority of people who are approaching bcoin as a currently held or potential investment/asset.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:20:26
So bcoin is both a commodity and a currency?
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:21:56
thanks, i do appreciate your positive assessment of what i'm worth. if you want to discuss bcoin, bcoin sentiment, and what might be next for bcoin, you can find me here in this thread.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:40:29
okay, but does that usefulness change in relation to price and if so, how? realistically, price is what most people are thinking about when they consider bitcoin as an 'investment' or 'asset' so it makes sense to approach it in those terms.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:07:36
saying passion drives human action isn't something that's helpful in determining whether bcoin gains or loses value, because it doesn't say anything instructive about the character or motivating factors behind that passion. passion drove bcoin to $19,500 and passion could send bcoin to $0.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:51:03
so you consider yourself a Doctor of bcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:33:36
isn't this a roundabout way of saying value is relative? that's sort of inherent to the concept, and there's nothing in that sort of approach/reasoning that will help us determine whether bcoin is headed to $40,000 or $40.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:23:33
they would probably have more use for that kind of prediction than the 80% loss they would have experienced if they bought bcoin a year ago. big financial losses like that don't make other life problems any easier.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:42:05
it's weird to me that bcoin fans are so eager to rush to comment histories in order to find any smidge that might be used to disqualify anti-bcoin sentiment. 
if you reread our comment chains and think about what i've said, you might realize i've poked unpatchable holes in the core claims you've made about the nature of bcoin and its value. those questions need to have sound answers and refutations if bcoin is to be successful, and invariably they do not. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:20:22
well, i appreciate that you think what i'm doing is worthy of compensation. returning to the content of what i'm saying, your answers to the questions i posed are either insufficient or contradictory. if you're legitimately interested, we can go back through the chain step by step and i will explain again why that is the case.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:05:39
i do it to help people. and it is fair to say that i dislike bcoinism on an emotional level, and that i see bcoin as a very bad investment based on a range of non-emotional criteria. that is much better and much less dangerous than buying and promoting it based on emotion.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:00:44
the specific price compared to USD is not irrelevant to somewhere around 99% of bcoin holders. if you're not giving actionable advice and you won't make the claim that bcoin will go up in value over a particular point in time and you're also not refuting a claim that bcoin is a bad buy at current prices, what are you presenting at this point besides a semi-philosophical, pseudo-scientific take on why you personally like bcoin as a non-practical conceptual entity?
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:19:15
you're returning to your same dumb comment with that 2 years bit. should we go through it again? will you re-tell me your comparisons are stupid when we repeat the process?
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:37:26
do i have to explain what an analogy is to you? can i use your explanation of what an analogy is to do so?

you literally said you were a Dr of Bcoin compared to me. please think about it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:19:41
it's in your analogy. i can quote your explanation of what an analogy is, if you like.

you're arguing like a person in a weak position, grasping for any reaching semantic out you think might be available. it's better to actually think about what i'm saying, but i've included your quotes as per your request.
"According to your reddit post history, You have been in Bitcoin for roughly 7 months. Please understand that people who have been around for as long as I have; Aren't really going to take half an hour to think about something that has been around for as long as you have. All the best though :)'
"Think of it like this:
Its like someone who is in their first semester of medical school telling a fully qualified Dr something and when the Dr disagrees, He gets told "Think about it for half an hour and then it might make sense to you"
​The Dr obviously isn't going to spend much time thinking about the opinion of some kid who has no idea, He is just going to dismiss it entirely. Get it?"
"Nope, Not at all... It's an Analogy.
Thats a big boy term that us adults use when we are trying to describe something to someone who might not completely understand what we are saying so we make a comparison to something else that the person might understand better.
It's a pretty good way of helping people to understand things that are a bit out of their depth. Its worth googling the term if you havn't heard of it before.
(EDIT: And no, before you ask... I'm not saying I'm an English teacher)"
