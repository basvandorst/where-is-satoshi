I think that’s the wrong answer, every time someone asks we should say “Yes” to every question! Keeps the trading going and could lose a lot of noobs money that we can then make!

China holds 1.4 trillion dollars of US debt. So in other words if you can’t pay your debts, those who own the debts lose. 
The US uses yearly deductions to pay for defense budgets of other countries. They currently don’t hold anyone’s debt.

Think about the millions of dollars lost to the ocean or fire, in catastrophes, those dollars are never reprinted.

I lost 800 coins back in 2010 to a house fire. Sadly I threw the hard drive away not caring because the insurance bought me a new computer. It was worth a whopping $96 back then, so I chucked the hard drive right in the trash (sobbing).

this is what I don't understand, in a nation where we have so many poor, why aren't these poor young millennial individuals buying Bitcoin, driving the price up? This is one sure way our society could turn the tides on Old money, money that controls a lot of interest in companies. I did like the fact that TRON is trying to buy BitTorrent, using their funds to do so. But I don't like how so many coins are in it for the money to just drop off the face of the earth, discrediting crytpo
