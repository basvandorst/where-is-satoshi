It's relatively common in Hong Kong to only accept USD. It's indeed cheap and easy to convert between HKD and USD, but why make accounting more difficult when you don't have to?
Try contacting the Hong Kong exchanges, [ANX]( [Gatecoin]( [Bitfirst]( and [Bitcashout]( Ideally your friend will be able to open an account, deposit BTC and withdraw them to the account of the supplier. If the exchanges do not allow withdrawals to third parties, localbitcoins can help too.

There'll be a rush for the exits. Bitcoin is one of these exits, and I hope by then we will have widened them far enough for people to not only get out, but choose this exit over others.
In the worst case, the exit doors will be shut or so small that nobody gets through.

I like [VPSBG]( If you run it with prune setting you can run a node for as little as 5 Euros per month, and get another 30% off if you pay with Bitcoin.
I'm running a Tor node and my personal website on this server and have been happy with it.
However, I run a full Bitcoin node on a raspberry Pi at home, which is even cheaper for me.

tldr: If you hold your bitcoins in cold storage you are not "delivering" them, so instead you have to make on-chain transactions for each user, every day. And for that you have to keep your coins online.

Your breadwallet is encrypted with the hardware key of your old iphone, and you wont be able to recover it on a new one.
I fear your only option is to take your old phone, get it running somehow (no wifi and no screen should not be a problem, you can use an external screen or connect it to itunes) and send your Bitcoin to a new wallet.

You are saying whales who hold a lot of Bitcoin are keeping the price artificially low? Just wait, soon they will have sold them all and the rally continues.
I think something different is happening. At 420 USD per coin, 1.5 million USD in Bitcoin are created every day out of thin air. For the price to remain stable, these Bitcoins have to find investors. New investors. That's tough for something as new and revolutionary like Bitcoin, but it's happening. Soon only 1,800 Bitcoins get created every day. Either a lot less people will have to buy Bitcoins to keep the price stable, or the price will increase.
edit: 1.5 million USD in Bitcoin

Depending on where you are you might find a Bitcoin ATM, or people who sell you Bitcoins for cash. A Bitcoin meetup might be a good idea, especially for small sums.    
Alternatively you can accept them for your services or buy them non-anonymously, and then tumble them into something that cannot easily be traced back, for example through altcoins or joinmarkets.

I agree that the government has to cut down on spending, but the only way this is somehow bearable for the citizens is if they cut down on earning too. That's only possibly through default.    
I don't really know how a new Greek government could convince its citizens to pay taxes after a default, and for which services, and which entitlements would be possible to keep intact.    
If Greece brings the Drachma back (which is not necessary just because they default on their debt), it sure is great for Bitcoin. Sucks for the people of Greece, though.

Yes. Or 比特幣 in traditional Chinese. You pronounce it *Bi Te Bi* in Mandarin and *Bei Dak Bai* in Cantonese. The first two syllables are a phonetic translation of Bitcoin (*Bi Te*), the last *Bi* just means money (the same *Bi* as in 人民幣 *Ren Min Bi*, the people's money). 
One alternative that to my knowledge predates *Bitebi* is 位元幣 (pronounced *Wei Yuan Bi* in Mandarin and *Wai Yun Bai* in Cantonese). *Wai Yuan* literally means bit, as in bits and bytes.

It is possible to verify user's keys in Telegram. Since the apps are open source, and you know how the apps create keys and handle the key exchange, you don't need to know what the server does.    
I would also really like to endorse the apps from Open Whisper Systems, as the people developing them are great, but they are so full of bugs. I'd love to trust them with sensitive stuff, but if the app randomly crashes, can't handle signups all the time and otherwise full of carelessness, how can I trust them?    
Sad conclusion is that you probably can't trust your phone with your life, use OTR and PGP instead. But if you are looking to increase your privacy a bit, Telegram is a great solution.

Anti-austerity is not necessarily pro government spending. Often it also means "pro default". To serve the interest and pay back Greece's debt, which corrupt Greek politicians amassed, the millions of Greek have to pay high taxes. This 'austerity' is nothing more than slavery, in which foreign and local banks and debtors practically own a percentage of Greece's income, for generations to come. To hell with that, let Greece default and rebuild as little of it as they really need to function as a society.    
Everyone who lent money to Greece in the past years pretty much had such a default coming, and they were well compensated for the risk they took already for the most part. Or they were just stupid to give their money to a corrupt government. Caveat emptor.

Hey watchlovers! Have you heard of the [Cryptomatic]( I personally don't own one (not enough coins to spare), but I've seen it in person and it's beyond pretty and of finest quality. My favorite part is they "only accept bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:45:42
My favorite is [BCVPN]( They have their service well integrated with the bitcoin protocol. You get a bitcoin address assigned when you sign up (no email address or other data required) and you deposit Bitcoins into it which get converted for minutes/days/weeks.
It shows the great advantage of bitcoin that I can buy a VPN for just 0.25 US$ for one day. I'm not aware of any other providers that do that.
if you dont want to reuse the assigned bitcoin address, you just sign up with another account.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:04:41
In the last picture you see the entrance to their actual store. It's tiny, but there's not a lot that they need.
I bought 1,000 HKD worth of bitcoins (~100 Euros) which turned out to be 0.20346785 BTC.    
You can only buy bitcoins there not sell them. They say they are looking into enabling that as well.    
To buy bitcoins there you need a government issued ID (HKID, Passport), email address and provide them with a valid address. They will then create an account on their online exchange and credit the bitcoins directly into your account there, rather then sending them to you directly.
Given that it is a great place to buy your first coins and get your account verified, but in the long run you might as well deposit cash straight into their bank account (in Hong Kong banks allow that). It gets credited relatively fast manually. Things are going very well in Hong Kong right now!

The namecoin blockchain could do something like that. You can register a username, for example via Passcard, and then just type the name into your app, or on an ATM or instead of a refund address. The application then looks up your username on the blockchain, finds the address associated with it and sends the coins.

have a look at how much processing power your node is using currently, and how much bandwidth.     
Having started up countless nodes on various servers, computers and raspberry pis, I found the limiting factor to always be processing power, not bandwidth. That's also how many attempts to feed the blockchain over bittorrent never developed far, it's simply not enough of an issue.

I hope we get some clarity on what this means and how exactly it is applied. The only document I find on their site says [You can no longer redeem Bitcoin into your Microsoft account.]( and is posted under "applies to windows 10 and windows 10 mobile".

Bobby Lee "said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day."
I most certainly agree, and not just that day. Not quite sure I understand them either.
What we identify as "miners" are actually just one pool operator, one hardware manufacturer and one exchange. Below them are data centers, power suppliers and investors, all with pretty weird contracts between each other and varying degrees of interest in Bitcoin as a currency, investment or political tool. They most certainly don't follow orders from Coinbase, Blockstream or Core, and they are far far more competent about the issue than non-Chinese think, and even more than they make themselves appear.

In theory, this changes nothing. VPN providers always had to register, and apart from a few corporate providers working with state-owned telecoms, VPN providers have always been acting in a legally murky state (like Bitcoin exchanges!).
In practice, nothing has changed so far. VPNs are being actively blocked, though with little effort that the large providers can get around with a few hours of work.
So this statement seems to just reiterate long standing policy (like the PBoC statements!). If there are any changes, you will not find out from these statements, but from their actions.
* Will they more pro-actively block VPN connections?
* Will they arrest Chinese citizens providing VPN solutions or working for foreign VPN companies?
* Will they arrest users or otherwise intimidate them?
* Will they publicly shame and single out big VPN companies as enemy of the state (as Turkey has)?
Pro tip: The easiest and fastest way to circumvent the Great Fire Wall has for a while now been SIM cards that roam inside of China with a very low fee. Google Fi works well, so does T-Mobile USA. [These China Mobile Hong Kong SIM cards]( (which you can buy for Bitcoin) offer a sort-of-private solution, as they do not require any real-name verification.

This is my understanding of how it works, please correct me if I'm wrong:
* three parties: the sender (of the remittances), the receiver (of the remittances) and the teller
* the sender signs up for abra and connects their debit or credit card
- the receiver signs up for abra
* the sender sends 100 USD to the receiver, 100 USD get debited from their account
* the receiver sees 100 USD in their abra account, which they have three days to cash out
* the receiver finds an Abra teller, which is just some guy dealing with Bitcoin
* the teller gives 100 USD worth of currency to the receiver
abra buys 100 USD worth of Bitcoin with the money debited from the sender
* abra sends the teller 100 USD worth of Bitcoin
somewhere in there are fees, i dont know who pays them or how they are calculated. but in the end the sender has 100 USD less and the receiver has 100 USD worth of foreign currency more, and the teller made a Bitcoin trade that they will have to hedge against separately
I would also fear that this Teller expects a significant commission which would make the trade either unprofitable for now, or create the need for subsidies.
For instance, cash-to-bitcoin traders on mycelium or localbitcoins often ask for as much as 10%

sadly they rather make their service free than accept Bitcoin payments. Would love to know their rational behind it.
How long do they think it will take them to find a credit card payment provider that doesn't ask these kinds of questions? I'm sure there was a reason they signed up for Paypal in the first place, and that reason is not the abundance of options.

I am actually very surprised this wasn't possible. When Segwit was proposed and explained to me multiple time, I was always under the strong impression that Segwit-transactions and non-segwit transactions would be able to "live alongside" each other, and that miners would still be able to choose which they want to put in.
Maybe because I too often heard them being compared to multi-sig addresses.

At the [Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong]( we obviously keep our Bitcoins and don't convert. We use [Coinpayments.net]( for online ticketing and are quite happy with it. Easy set up, no annoying questions, purely a software solution.
When selling tickets in person however we use the [Blockchain.info]( Merchant app. The best thing about this app is that we can securely set it up on all our volunteer's phones without worry. All Bitcoins are forwarded to our cold storage address.      
I personally also run a small online shop called [Too Free To Fail]( It runs on shopify, so I am limited to either Coinbase or Bitpay. Setting up Coinbase as a non-US merchant looked like a huge hassle, so I went with Bitpay instead. Getting approved for a 1,000 USD daily limit was as easy as pasting the url to my shop into their form, and I've been happy with them ever since. All funds are forwarded to my cold storage address, from where they are occasionally converted to Hong Kong Dollars using [ANX](
I would love to experiment a bit with Mycelium Gear though, and also Electrum, which I use a lot as a wallet on my computer, aside from running Core on my computer, and Core on a Raspberry Pi 2 (i know, I'm bragging now...).

There is risk and work associated with doing this.
* Risk of having your Coinbase or bank account shut down for compliance reasons
* You will have to vet your localbitcoins contacts to determine identity fraud. This takes time.
* You risk dealing with identity fraud, and your activity to sell Bitcoins on localbitcoins will make you sketchy in the eyes of police and lawyers. The burden will be on you to prove you did everything you could if you are dragged into a civil court.
* Counterparty risk. What if Coinbase or localbitcoins shut down?
There is no free lunch, any premium in the markets reflects risk preferences of its participants.

Who has the keys to the 2-of-2? If you have only one of them, you cannot move the coins out, but neither can the other party.
In this case I don't think you got scammed, and you should have some way to negotiate with the other party. Why can you not contact them? Are they unhappy about your service? Maybe you can settle with them, for example by offering to close the contract and refund half of their deposit (from the 2-of-2 account).

Chinese have very few opportunities to invest. The housing market is blown up beyond reason and control, the stock market is rigged and there's nothing else available.    
Bitcoin fits in very nicely here, because it allows players to gamble on  multiple international markets at once. I'm not convinced this is solely good for Bitcoin though. When you gamble you are more interested in 20x leverage positions than holding coins securely in cold storage. And from what we know, these exchanges will eventually go bust or be seized, and the larger the money that will 'disappear', the larger the backlash on Bitcoin.

For those who don't want to click on a Facebook link, here is the [direct link](
[Here on the official Bitmain shop]( the device only costs 39 USD. I suppose the difference is shipping and customs?
Based on my calculations, at current difficulty, you will mine a block with this roughly every 56,000 years. As all devices are configured as solo miners, this means one in 56,000 customers of this thing has a rough chance of finding a single block in the next year, including transaction fees valued at around 13.5 BTC and ~8,800 USD right now.
If you were compensated 'fairly' for your mining power, you would earn roughly US$ 0.15 over the next year, again, assuming constant difficulty.
In theory, it would be awesome if all Bitcoin users had devices like this at home. It would make mining more decentralized. At the current hash rate, we'd need about 34 million homes to get 50% of the mining power (assuming nobody will drop out or enter in addition to the 34 million devices added).
However, what is that decentralization worth if all devices are pointed to the same pool?

No, pyramid schemes and especially the notorious London Gold Trading scam are hard to prosecute because the victims often sign away all their rights. He was arrested for causing a nuisance, but that's an irrelevant charge and he'll maximally get a small fine.

I'm glad they adopt the sat/byte metric. So many wallets, including Core, still use less convenient metrics like mBitcoin/kB, or Bitcoin/kB.
When going forth and back between [bitcoinfees.21.co]( and Core I have to do multiple conversions.

Banking forces you to make the choice: Us or them? Soon there will be a tipping point and 'them' will become the obvious choice for everyone. It's all about network effects.

The guy is running a pyramid scheme well known in the Hong Kong community, but not much beyond. Disappointed his publicity stunt is getting so much uncritical attention

The fascinating and often overlooked effect of proof-of-work is that it creates a constant supply of Bitcoins. Miners mine their Bitcoins on the margin, meaning they in the long run need to sell all of their profits to pay for electricity.
This not only allowed Bitcoin to develop a liquid market early on, it also ensures that the market does not easily dry up.
It's quite in contrast to ideas like proof-of-stake, where miners don't necessarily have the need to immediately sell their coins, reducing liquidity and making markets less efficient.

And while there is only economic freedom in Singapore, Hong Kong additionally allows political freedom as well, and freedom of speech, and the freedom to be queer and all the other things that make Singapore an (economically very free) corporate police state.

[ANX]( So far has the best options to deposit money. They have an account with Bank of China, and to deposit money you can either wire it in, or if your home bank charges fees for that you can deposit money into their account using almost any Bank of China ATM.
But the process is rather slow, you have to email the advice slip in together with a short code.
[Bitfinex]( also has a HK bank account (Bank of America), but i dont think there is an easy process of depositing into it. Somehow you end up emailing the team and they'll do it manually, or at least that's what it was like half a year ago.

What you forget is that the Chinese government maintains a tight grip on their companies, even the private ones. QQ coins and Alipay are just as much under the control of the government as the RMB is. And they will go a long way to not see a third digital currency take over. They can block TOR, and they will block the Bitcoin protocol if necessary.
For now, Alipay is very easily exchangeable with Bitcoin. Most people that trade their BTC for RMB on  use Alipay as the medium of exchange.

they make 0.6% from each trade, but from each side. a cost of 1.2% is not that insignificant. so even more, i agree with you

is this the most expensive bitcoin tip so far? And I cant even figure what it was for!
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:00:16
in this case i must be doing something seriously wrong, because i get charged for buying (in btc) and for selling (in my default fiat currency), both times 0.6%

That is indeed a valid fear. We will see what happens in 20 years, but right now Singapore is China's bitch.
