My business offers discounts for people who pay us in Bitcoin.  We own a vacation rental business in Thailand.  It seems to work well for us.  Some of our long-term renters pay us in Bitcoin.  It's quite nice.

Cool!!   I love hearing about more and more Bitcoin adoption throughout the world.   I started a vacation rental company in Hua Hin, Thailand and accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as rental payments.  It's been great for my clients as well as myself!  If anyone is interested in staying in a nice house or condo along the beach, PM for more info about our services.  Seems like a lot of people are starting to use their cryptos to pay for things  as they travel around the world.

This is actually kind of both funny &amp; sad to me.  I used to own a fairly popular small restaurant &amp; bar many moons ago, and I also noticed I was paying around $30,000+ USD per year in credit card fee transactions.  
I figured if I could significantly reduce the amount of credit card transaction fees during all the years that I might own this business---by the time my daughter was ready for college, I would be able to pay for her entire university career just from eliminating a large portion of the credit card transaction fees.  (For those non Americans reading this, a decent US college is SUPER expensive!)
I decided that I really wanted my clientele to pay with cash, so I started offering a 10% discount on any bill that paid in cash.  No luck.  I even had the 10% discount offer printed on all menus and bills.   No one took me up on the the offer.
Then I thought to myself, "perhaps people just don't carry cash with them on a regular basis these days".   So.....I installed an ATM machine in the restaurant and I even offered to pay for the ATM transaction fees, if they would just pay for their bill in cash.  Still no luck.  99% of my customers still paid for their meals with a credit card.
Then it hit me.  Most Americans don't have cash.  They're most likely living on borrowed credit.  I sold the business and left the USA.

I don't know it this helps much, but I have a company that rents vacation rentals in Hua Hin, Thailand.  I have been accepting Bitcoin for a couple of years now.  I also accept Ethereum, but no one has paid me in ETH yet.  I have had quite a few rentals paid in BTC, though!!

Thanks for the heads up on our SSL certificate.  I'm trying to get it corrected today.   
 Hopefully, it will be resolved soon.

Overall, not that many.  We had about 3-4 crypto customers in 2017 (out of approximately 100 total renters) , and once I meet with them in person and they let me know they are familiar or comfortable with crypto, I always suggest they pay their rent in BTC, or ETH.  To be honest, the majority of our past crypto clients  initially seem excited about paying with bitcoin, but in the end they usually seem to want to keep their crypto and pay with cash.  That said, I'd definitely like to see more people pay with BTC.

Thanks yeh-nah-yeh!!  Really appreciate the nice comment!!  However, I did convert a small amount of BTC to ETH (right before it dropped from 290+ USD to 190+ USD) - but still keeping it all in crypto!!  Ha!  My wife advised me to just move some fiat to ETH instead of converting the BTC....should have listened to her.

Also, with our business, the transfer time is not really an issue for us.  In our experience the bitcoin transfers were very fast (if I remember correctly, about 10 minutes to confirm), but even if it hypothetically took a couple of days to receive the rental fee transfer via BTC, it would be just the same as receiving a traditional  wire transfer from an overseas bank account.  Thankfully, it doesn't take that long with BTC, so bitcoin is already better than traditional wire fund transfers.
I remember waiting several weeks to receive a traditional wire fund transfer from HSBC Hong Kong several years ago.  The landlord was furious it was taking so long.  
To add a little more perspective, many of our clients make local bank transfers.  For example, if the the money is coming from Bangkok Bank to let's say, Kasikorn Bank (even from within the same city), it can take up to a full business day to confirm (especially if it's over 100,000 THB).  BTC is way better.
