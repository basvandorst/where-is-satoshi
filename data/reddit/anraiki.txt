Looks like their server is being slow or not responding.

Ah thanks. I wasn't so sure if the wallet was just an static address for all the coins to go to.

As a trader, not to have bitcoin in the personal wallet.
Certain patterns that are observable such as a exchange reopening and how people react to them.

How is that going?

Something fishy going on with Bitfloor. On my part, I did a ACH withdrawal and the money went no where.

I am currently getting that resolve at the moment.

If you going to panic sell, don't have the bitcoin in your wallet. I could of sold at 200+ and bought back in at 150. Instead confirmation took time and time is money.

I probably wouldn't expect any funds for at least a year :\

When all the blocks are solved what is predicted to happen to bitcoin? And when is it predicted for all to be solved? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:17:16
It's all about timing in my opinion.

I was just going to say something about this. Checking out the history of the vendor is probably the  thing you should do before making any transaction. Especially if it's online.

Were you not here for the Silk Road dip? It was at $120 when it happen then it dip to $80. 2 weeks later, it surged to $200.

I made a withdrawal, and it went through. I have no funds in my account and still haven't seen any action in my bank's checking.
@_date: 2013-02-24 17:18:45
Lies! But I will remain hopeful.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:23:47
Haven;t you been reading? Looking at graph patterns and at least seeing in hindsight what would most likely happen now?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:47:04
Dude. I bought at 260 then suddenly it crumbled. The God had to smite me today.
Now it's going back up.
Lesson learned.

I requested a ACH Withdrawal. Money went on hold. Few days later, money is gone. I didn't get a chance to send identification nor my bank information to withdraw the money to.
