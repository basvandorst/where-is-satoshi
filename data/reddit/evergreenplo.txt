What's the point of putting money in there if you can't transfer it to a bank and they don't have any coins to pay us either?

Don't debase marijuana users like that sir/madam =)

If an idea doesn't seem at least partially insane, then what good is it?

Buying Bitcoin for $10 each! Hurry while you can ! llol
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:21:57
Who doesn't want to buy them? 
Why is this douchebag on my screen? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:31:10
Which is for one of the ten blocks. 9 of the 10 have 3000 btc each
It's not gonna be near 200k USD (which there's not a chance in hell) it's stil gonna be a great deal

Has Macau adopted BTC??

When you first install Google Authenticator, it prompts you to write down a code. This code is your back up.

ten percent arbit wasn't a joke tho
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:11:05
Good lord I need to hurry up and buy 10k worth 
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:07:37
Don't be so naive 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:42:45
There are tons of people like that on both sides of the sexes but noone ever took their hubris to this level 
Who the fuck is this bitch to ruin someone's life? She's the definition of a nobody, an active participant in the disinformation campaign that is the "free press" 
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:26:44
Frankly this makes a lot of sense following the markets. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:07:31
The fact that people are still bringing it up is great evidence of the disinfo against Ross
When the shit hit the fan anyone with half of a working brain called foul on the murder for hire allegations
Then we were all vindicated when the 2 main investigating agents where both found to be stealing and falsifying evidence (chatlogs etc)
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:36:52
Yeah dude that's exactly the point they would be an asset
@_date: 2019-10-23 03:30:05
ITS STILL REAL TO ME DAMMIT
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:42:20
There's one at Mediterranean Deli on Franklin St is that the one you mean? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:52:29
Wooooo thx needed that
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:43:57
None of those "murders" occurred. Why are you so willfully ignorant? Go have a beer. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:40:06
You from America? You ever voted or paid taxes? Then you indirectly killed innocents. People die, there's 7 billion people on this earth right now
I'm not self absorbed enough to truly believe all life is scared 
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:21:48
The agent made things about having dox info on Ross 
Then made another account to contact Ross to suggest taking out the leaker.. 
Study up bucko
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:23:10
Dude read up on the facts of the indictment. No one can argue against the fact that Force and the other agent did create personas to solicit and blackmail 
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:31:47
Now it's 6 people? Frankly no I don't care because it's proven that the agents were corrupt so why would I take any of their "evidence" as legitimate? 
Let me ask you where are you getting these numbers from and why do you have such a problem with someone that set up an escrow market? 
Grow up. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:40:54
Entrapment isn't murder 
Facts of the case please brush up on them. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:40:20
Then why are you bringing up charges that are a complete and total result of the two corrupt agents actions and therefor one hundred perfect bogus and unchargeable
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:41:17
Lastly I'll add this. If someone approached you with all the names and information of your loves ones and threatening their lives what would you do? Goto the police? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:26:05
He's not guilty of murder for hire. 
When did I say anything about btc? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:30:47
Does it really surprise you? 
It's been proven time and again the whole murder for hire was 2 agents playing both sides against Ross 
If this while thing was so obviously criminal why did the investigators have to create so much of the evidence themselves? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:05:39
How about the points in the affidavit that Force created unsanctioned personas to extort and defraud Ross? 
Kinda like the flimsy ass murder for hire allegations? 
Ross' journal serves as proof of the lies perpetuated by the investigators. All their evidence is tainted 
The 250k figure is the one Ross talks about any unknown blackmailers asking for and him paying. This is before the RedandWhite bullshit. That prior blackmailing sets precedent that the investigators are doing this to basically entrap Ross. 
Not that any of it will matter. Ross is still going to stay in prison. What do you think the government will admit to their wrongdoing? Hahahahahabbahahahahahahhahahaha
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:41:03
Tell that to Ross who had an entire trial conducted on the definition of tainted evidence. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:12:39
Pawn shops care if they sell stolen goods
Private parties cannot buy stolen goods if they know their origin
The coins were stolen. The precedent is was set a long time ago 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:46:40
This means something. What idk
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:22:59
There's 2 bitcoin amounts matching the 2 numbers DPR said he sent to addresses supplied by R&amp;W. 
Damn. They set him up so damn good, lolol
So R&amp;W knows how to set up a bitcoin wallet and yet does not know how to get rid of the coins? That should raise a red flag lol . Ross was a puppy 
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:49:26
No she doesn't know what she's saying because she's saying she is getting hate bc she's a woman
No you're getting hate bc your thinly veiled porn wrapped in Uber shitty so called hip hop isn't selling anymore because you're worn out. Go back to Atlanta and get passed around like you did before Swaggy played captain 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:52:13
Sorry I was still in HHH commenting mode not Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:16:51
Hence why I say they would love the value to increase.
Hell if you don't think these coins gonna dissapear I got a bridge to sell ya 
@_date: 2013-07-29 22:07:31
Just tried it now.. Went through. Early maintenance maybe? It was definitely before 2am when I initially tried 
@_date: 2013-07-30 03:40:15

Lololol thanks
@_date: 2013-08-27 14:22:44

Yes exactly. Thanks for furthering my point
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:48:00
No matter what speed they're up to they can't break an encrypted wallet lol
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:12:57
LOL the feds don't understand Bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-07-28 02:40:30

Have you been seeing the jumps in difficulty? That's one month at current rates 
@_date: 2013-08-27 18:43:55
No sir. Never arrived. Bought w campbx and initiated the transfer as usual. Waited til I saw ten confirms and checked the road. Nothing new there. There was about 1 btc there from before and was still there 
@_date: 2013-07-29 06:32:54
Same error. "Minimum transfer allowed is BTC 0.01000000."
@_date: 2013-07-13 01:41:55
Is this source selling the coins extremely vetted and trusted? Seems shady
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:53:04
Bitcoins stability post Silk Road crackdown prove Bitcoin doesnt care about illegal drugs 
@_date: 2013-06-25 20:00:25
It was a joke. ASIC mines all their bitcoin from people paying bitcoin to make some hopefully a year down the road.
This is doubly brilliant from ASIC producers stand point. Charge BTC to make it 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:23:23
Why does Fiat work? Because of faith in the system. I do not see why this is hard to understand. 
Dollars are worth what they are worth because of what ? Faith. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:42:39
They never made it to the road.
My account balance is the same as before trying to transfer these btc
No unauthorized transactions either.

Belly aching is asking a company to fufill the product or service in the manner that was agreed upon that you have already paid them for ? Fucko. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:37:27
Double touche
@_date: 2013-08-27 18:17:19
How could they be stolen from the road if they never arrived? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:45:20
Why? They have 27k of them. I'd bet they want the value to skyrocket Lol
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:57:40
So the point of bitcoin miners is to mine Bitcoin from people with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:39:56
Not about killing Bitcoin more like a $3million+ windfall that can be used however they wish 
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:56:09
Just wanted a pat on the back ! Lol Definitely no certainty
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:11:37
Now you're thinking. Fuck didn't even think of that angle.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:59:46
No problem. Thanks for your civil reply! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:22:18
Wish it would so I could buy with confidence lol
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:35:26
