You're the same ashol that advocates higher ground and calling by its "proper name" as soon as it suits you. But when it doesn't you switch and call other things what you want so stfu and eat some motherfucking pie. You're spazman30 now. Enjoy your new name

It's called budgeting. If you have disposable income and you choose to use a part of it to buy whatever you want instead of saving it, then that is your choice. That whatever can be bitcoin

Everyone uses ups for school, work, education, freedom of expression, creating competitive products, etc... let's see how opposed to NN you are when some new product they decide needs to be shipped on a bigger box regardless of size and the manufacturer can't afford it but his bigger competitors can OR this manufacturer was revolutionizing the space/industry but hits a pay wall.

@_date: 2018-01-12 11:57:26
Same, I'll keep buying even if overpriced. If, as an example,  bitcoin is really worth 20k a coin, I'll buy regardless of price. Because it's not about the money, although it's nice to get gains, its about sending a message.
No longer am I gonna give you my money so you can make even more money of my back and give me less than nothing in return. Good riddance

Lol sure why not whatever helps your rhetoric. What I meant by that statement was that people have bills or goods they rather buy rather than bitcoin... just cause you believe it's cheap atm doesn't imply you use all your disposable income to buy it. Get real bro.

They actually didn't have more money to put in or couldn't justify buying more than what they did. Don't be a schmuck stfu

It's called projection
He never really cared about the message or idea behind bitcoin. He would be in for the gains and that alone. Since price per bitcoin is so high now, he knows he missed his opportunity. So he just wants it to fail cause he's a sore neutral... I didn't get anything from this and even if I tried know it wouldn't be much I want it to fail so it reinforces that I was right to never get in the space. Cause the alternative is that he was wrong and no no no that can never be. Quite sad

I guess the overhead of handling physical currencies shouldn't be allotted to the total carbon footprint of physical currencies. In the same vein bitcoin, being a digital currency, has zero carbon footprint because we can't allot digital carbon footprint to digital currencies. This is your reasoning. Get real.

Point 1 doesn't make sense.  
I was able to use 4 ledger nano s and one ledger nano x to create a multisig with electrum server.   
I was able to put in 0.01 btc in and then use 3 of the ledgers to sign a transaction to move the 0.01 btc back to it's original wallet...   
So... why is he having two premade keys an issue?   
I have 5 premade keys (one per ledger) and multisig worked fine...

Seems like there is no risk but loss of privacy at worst so who knows what you're talking about. Just cause you're a bitcoin maximalist doesn't mean everyone else has to be and if they have some semblance of not being or have interest in any other projects you fly off the handle. Get a grip and try to have a civil and constructive manner to express yourself

Thanks for answering politely Also, does this expose anything about the signing address?
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:34:28
Thanks much appreciated. People get way too toxic here. Who cares if it's a scam or not, they are your bitcoins/wallet(s) and you can do as you please with them. I dont see why asking about signing and what it exposes in association with another project causes such vitriol. It's kind of sad. That being said, from a couple comments below it seems like it's safe so do as you please and be safe to never expose your keys. By the way you said HW ledger and electrum you should be good to go.
Only thing I dont know is if this exposes how much you posses or anything like that which would be a consequence.
Does anyone here willing to answer courteously know?
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:42:35
Makes sense then why most projects like this say to consolidate into one address
This also does expose your amount held in the signing address correct?
@_date: 2019-01-07 14:06:10
As does usb...  who cares how you broadcast signed transactions when the device itself shows you what you are signing for... if it doesn't match dont click confirm... only way you get hacked is if someone figures out how to hack transaction signing to change it which would make crypto useless so... stop talking nonsense about bluetooth being unsecure it about how used...

1)literally attempting to own the name "bitcoin"   
2)was created under the guise of "we need to scale now cause the problem is real".. when in reality it was done to separate the community and do the same as detailed in point 1  
3)sketchy ass addition into coinbase with halted training  
4) backed by a federal prisoner who sold explosives online curtailing all measures to prevent so  
5)backed by chinese miners almost exlusively  
6)most of its nodes are hosted in chinese datacenters (extremely centralized)  
7)block size increase was irrelevant because of segwit and lightning  
8)actively attempting to confuse newcomers into buying BCH instead of BCC  
9) attempting to rebrand the real bitcoin into bitcoin core  
10)actively refuses bcash name although its both appropriate and fitting due to see: reason 1  
11)owning bitcoin.com and using it as a means of disinformation. it would be moral to have a disclaimer on the site to distinguish between BCH and BTC... this is not there and doesnt exist  
12)Active personas in favor of it want to discredit bitcoin with unbacked arguments with no basis on reality or fact  
could keep going but whats the freaking point you wont see whats obviously in front of you and deny facts so theres no point in reasoning with you enjoy your investment in bcash i hope i am wrong and it actually has a value and you make some money because if not youre in for a rude awakening. sorry
