Actually I do agree. Everyone that is considering not HODLing is being spit at just for even mentioning the thought of selling at one time. Well I sold some a few days ago after refreshing my charts every 5 minutes.... Now you may destroy me with your comments. Why am I being stupid to sell now and buy back at a lower price? For now it stopped me from losing a few k. If I buy back at current rate and it goes back to 8500 let's say next week I did a good job in my eyes...
Those claiming they got into it because of the technology... don't make me laugh...
If you love the technology then take some programming courses and get a job in the industry. That'll make you way more happy.

just try gdax.com (rebranded in Coinbase pro definitely soon). It's the same company with a "Single sign on" so no need to create a new account.
you can import your coinbase funds in a matter of seconds without fees and send them back whenever you want if you want to cash out and send money back to your bank account
Just set a Limit POST ONLY order and you'll have no fees.

Wished that stable price was a bit higher :)

I think about 9980. After what happened last time at around 10.000 a lot of people that are buying now or missed out on sellout last time are setting that limit as it will be VERY hard to even reach the 9990.

hahaha you made my day :)

We agree on a lot of things (reading your comments all the time) but just don't let little kids fuck you up. Be the bigger man and leave the discussion for what it is. If we keep reacting this kindergarten will never stop.

Definitely your GF is something you shouldn't HODL. I guess you got into her by FOMO. Any way not a good investment...
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:14:54
And we have a winner... loved the battle :)
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:29:43
Am I right when I say we saw a few dump atempts today that just didn't work meaning we'll probably continue the slow climb?
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:22:59
it will only work great for you if you miss it again :)
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:22:20
Don't worry about it too much. This one got triggered by 7600, May 30 was by 7500 and May 28 by 7250.
For me it means many people are willing to buy and are pushing the dumpers to higher prices. We're winning... for the moment ;)

TA is "bull"shit ;)

I agree, ben het met je een$ ;)
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:04:04
I dont think it will go over 9980. We saw last time what it did at 9990. So everyone sets a limit that is lower than the last limit just to recover losses from january as much as possible and leave for at least a year and then try again.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:28:54
no they are not... "people" are leaving for now... China is buying all the dips and they are hodling ;)
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:20:46
I sure hope some shorters got wrecked big time in this last run...
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:53:46
it just brought a big dump 1 minute ago :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:21:16
you mean your losses right? :)
