For sure but doesn't cashing out into fiat imply a drop? Seems to be holding up ok so far. Good news for those who want a higher price.
How about the bitcoin vision? Are speculation/trading and mass adoption compatible or even desirable? Sorry, i missed the first 10 years, trying to catch up :) eg Familly member in South Africa earns in local currency roughly 12.5 to the $1... imagine the scope of those price variations in countries with comparatively low incomes? Daily, weekly, even monthly salary value price swings in a day, wow. Mass adoption... really? Or are we only talking about the west?

Aspiration?

Righty o then... an object of pure speculation. Fair enough :)

This is what you call a well-rounded  argument... Bitcoin style. A proper, old-skool Twitter shitstorm

Do you think there's a possibility  people are holding back over weekends now there is so obviously institutional work-hours involvement or influence?

Over on BitcoinMarkets someone suggested the possibility that maybe alt profits going to fiat via bitcoin may be a part of the current picture. Wondering what you guys might think? &amp;, is this kind of coupling/trading ultimately part of the Bitcoin vision?

Big differences over here i guess. Sounds like you have an easy and flexible system. So is the figure quoted a surprise to you, would you expect more ownership/participation, is it a non-story? Been educated on your system a little, thanks guys. Most off us here are screwed for sure, most even expect the state pension to cease before our time to retire. Crypto could be an answer to many people and problems around the world. Thats why we're here right?

Crypto is the end of humanity, positively the worst thing for the human ever concieved... i'm into it anyhow, as the rest of humanity is not my problem. Haha sorry, couldnt resist
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:38:35
Er...because theres no regulation. Don't you know anything about human nature. Abuse happens because it's possible
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:58:55
Haha good luck...been trying for ages... for most its all about the Benjamins- clearly

Pension funds are the norm in UK and even the gov raided in past. Probably different systems exist around the world. All though, will invest in multi-national co's. The point i was making is the amount of investors seems small and sarcastically i implied a lack of trust and gave a local example. Apologies. Not having to trust a third party, the motivation for crypto's creation

Stick to gambling

Haha... could always secure your wager on the byteball dag and have it as a snapshot for posterity... at least you would actually have proof you actually used the tech we all profess to believe in
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:32:57
And pensions never get lost, abused or stolen... no wait... BHS, Carrillion, Lecturers... ... ... the term we're looking for here is currency debasement. Crypto might just be the antithesis of all this
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:17:50
Totally agree on all points. Stagnant Wage growth etc. Crypto another egg in the basket. Some things are the same then :)
