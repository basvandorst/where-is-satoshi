I think you're trying to be witty. There must be a "California is terrible to business" reference in there, I imagine. I'm just having trouble fishing it out.
CA law considers patrons' tips the exclusive property of the employee(s), not the employer; the employer is not allowed to deduct anything from tips.

Wasn't TouchID breached in a short amount of time? 
The concept is fine; it's just that people use their thumbs or index fingers (prints of which can be lifted from elsewhere on the phone easily as they're the most used fingers) and it was programmed with a rather large margin of error (so people won't get frustrated trying to get into their phones).

If you're in California, this is illegal. 
Might be the same in other states. I recommend you give a quick call to a labor attorney; if this is the restaurant's  longtime policy, that's a huge liability over the years.

For whom though? The "best" rates are nearly impossible to qualify for (the lender will find a way to add .5% here or there). The average is 4%+ according to

Modern-day finance and business is built on inflation. If same-store revenue isn't going up every year, you're doing something wrong.

Shhh! Let people obsess over the alleged "discrepancies" in the law instead.

The point wasn't how much he sent; it was to 15 different people in different countries. Sending 15 wires to people in 15 different countries would cost roughly $1000.

So Apple's efforts to make an otherwise-secure system "stupid proof" are its shortcomings....

I'm still a bit confused. Instead of a 15% tip, you get an 11.55% tip? (15% less (3% of meal+15% tip))

This is untrue.
In most asset disclosure requests/orders, there are so-called catchall provisions (for example: "state any other asset you possess or control") which bitcoins would definitely fall under. If a person is not going to disclose cash, s/he is not going to disclose bitcoins, either. If a lawyer does not put in a catchall provision, then s/he is a poor lawyer.

Bitcoin is very compatible with the existing informal money transfer system Hawala.

Okay, I give you that it's good news that Apple is at least open to having bitcoin apps. 
But... Considering the vast majority of states have said jack squat about bitcoin (including the one Apple is HQ'd in), what exactly does "in compliance" mean? It is the only section in the guidelines that has such a requirement.

Fair enough. I haven't looked for a car loan lately but my friends with good credit have complained about the teaser rates... it could be where we live, of course, as well.

Bitcoin arguably isn't illegal under existing law.
This legislation is meant to make it possible for Facebook, Apple, Google, etc., to put into circulation their proprietary currencies.
Edit: current law *may* apply to miners. But even that's arguable.

In the US, you can buy a reloadable GreenDot Visa/MC card everywhere. 
You pay for them with cash. In order to activate, you have to provide ID information about yourself but they do not do a credit check (they may deny the activation for other reasons, like criminal history). These cards are essentially for people who need/want to pay for things online -- or just don't want to carry around cash -- but can't qualify for a credit card or open a bank account.
GreenDot fees hit you in multiple places, however. There is an activation fee, a monthly fee if you don't use the card enough, and a reload fee. The partnered ATM network (for free withdrawals) also isn't all that impressive.
Because of these fees, I consider GreenDot and similar "services" to the unbanked/underbanked to be rip-offs. If Bitcoin companies can provide similar services and charge less, that will be big to the underbanked/unbanked.

Well, odds are the spouse-doing-the-hiding probably boasted to his/her soon-to-be-ex-spouse that s/he just made a killing from his bitcoin investment when they were still on good terms. Good luck convincing the court that, no, that investment never actually happened.

It's unclear from her post if this is what is happening (which is still illegal in some states) or if he's taking ALL of the credit card fee from her tip (which is illegal under the DOL regs).

Because having it held in the ECB is (was?) considered safer by the banks than lending it out to consumers, buying corporate or government bonds, or other options.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:14:21
Banks have cash deposited with the ECB because it's considered a safe place to hold assets (even though, up until this point, it was 0% interest). This move is designed for force banks from keeping cash reserves in the ECB and, instead, lend that money to consumers and businesses (mortgages, loans, etc.). Chances are, the banks will just use the cash to buy up (safe) government bonds...which isn't all that helpful and could actually cause greater problems down the road as that will warp the government bond market. The ECB hinted that it would attempt additional measures to force banks to lend money to consumers if the negative interest rate doesn't do it.
There's a reason European banks aren't lending which isn't solved at all by this move: they don't consider it safe to do so. They're looking out for their bottom lines and don't believe Average Jacque's mortgage or business loan will be safe investments. Will the ECB taxing banks' cash deposits change that calculus? Who knows, this is uncharted territory for a monetary region as big as the Eurozone.
