I would suppose you voted for Hillary too huh?  Because your "informed" vote counted right?  No.  Because it was either A or B, and your vote really didn't matter.  Trump was a better *option* huh?
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:53:13
Disregard the fact that neither option A or B were a step in the right direction?  Keep the rose colored glasses on, mine are always on.

"Internet token" says it all.  The irony here.

For those that don't get it, here is a direct quote from Paul Krugman:  "*By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machines*".
More context:  Paul Krugman linked an article on his twitter feed stating "*This is a very good explanation of how libertarian derp drives Bitcoin*", in reference to a [Washington Post article]( that attacks bitcoin and states "*If Bitcoin is the future, then progress is in the past*".

You guys aren't getting it.  The dollar doesn't go away correct, instead it is being devalued by a digital representation of value.  So yes, it is consuming fiat.  Ironically the fed is devaluing all placeholders of value including fiat and bitcoin, but fiat at a very unsustainable pace.

It seems he really struggled with that, like he almost had an axiety attack trying to improvise.

Fucking hell .....this is a dead horse issue.  Things have value because we say they do.  Is there value in a network that can maintain a global DLT? Absolutely.  
Gold is a great semiconductor, outside of that where is the value?  
Global DLT to maintain a placeholder of value for every individual on earth should be the number one priority for humanity.

This is a great reflection on the security of Bitcoin.  Someone meme this shit asap.  Two ATM theft stories .... One where the thiefs cut a fiat ATM open and steal the fiat and the BTC machine busted up with nothing taken.
