haha yes, my dad sends me "scare articles" from now and then. Most people don't get that the banks, governments and the "free press" are all hand-in-mouth in being biased against cryptos.

Could you please elaborate? How do i pay off the credit card bill using btc?
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:04:08
I'd prefer to not be reliant on someone. Thanks for the idea though. One of the initial btc users who lived off of BTC used his friend to pay for his expenses back in the day.

I don't see what's wrong with spending 40BTC on a lambo. If you were an early adopter you're bound to have way more than 40 BTC. I wouldn't be suprised if someone like that owned 100-1000+ BTC. He probably has a ton of other income on the side, so tossing out 40BTC isn't that big of deal. Plus think of it, he's actually promoting BTC on the STREET! 
I think we should celebrate this guy and his success instead of "advising" him. One of us made it big guys!

i know photoshoppers who can transform people..doing something like this is a joke, even a noob like me could do it. 
Of course it's fake. If Mcafee wanted to profit, he could simply buy the coin and shill it and rake way more than a measly 25 BTC.

Thank you. Good comment. For now, I'm just going to hodl but I'm going to think twice before redoubling long until I see a correction.

I know how you felt. The first time I lost 1 whole BTC equivalent in a phishing attack devastated me for a few hours. However, it was quite a while back. All I know is, you'll get over it.

RemindMe! 12 months.

haha, good one.

Very interesting. As someone with bodybuilding interests, I would love to read more about the history behind this.

Thanks for the reminder OP. Good to have the voice of reason from vets in times like these. However, do keep in mind that if bitcoin does crash to 0 (i don't think it ever will) it will be a black swan event and past experiences wouldn't matter.

I don't know why people like yourself even bothered investing in crypto. You should have stuck to stocks. Would have saved yourself a lot of grief.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:10:43
Yeah I'm all right. Kind of expect these things to happen. I will not be alright if say bitcoin goes below 2k or even 3-4k.
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:14:25
Awesome, thank you!

Haha I'm in Thailand as well. It does cross my mind a few times.

Yeah I read about this. You have nothing to worry about as it'll be up in no time. It seems there was a security flaw in their file system that caused a customer's account to be hacked and he lost 0.3 and 0.4 BTC in seperate attacks. Also, the customer was a Data Mining engineer, and you know how much attention to detail those guys give to things, so he noticed the attack and reported immediately. I'm not sure if there were other customers who lost coins and never noticed it.  It appears 0.5 was the limit at which a confirmation mail was sent, and the attacks were below that threshold, so it wasn't a major thing but they've made it offline in order to fix it and they said they'll bring it back up shortly. Also, I read that 0.1 BTC was going to be the new threshold for confirmations.
I use coinsecure btw. Sometimes I buy over there at better rates than unocoin (both are still very expensive compared to US exchanges, but as long as the difference holds when we sell a few years from now i think it should be fine). Unocoin generally is more predictable with it's deposits and they don't get overloaded as often, so i'll still recommend them.
