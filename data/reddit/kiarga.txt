If Bitpay or Shift are you only connection to fiat then find a new link soon. Bitpay uses the same bank, and that bank has been cancelling Shift and Bitpay accounts in mass this week. You may not have until April. We didn't:

I wish they had given me a warning like that. My girlfriend and I lost 3 out 4 debit card accounts without warning in the same week(1 Shift and 2 Bitpay) while we are living in Eastern Europe for 6 months.
The bank didn't notify us about our Bitpay cards but had the nerve to try and charge us $15 each for declined ACH transfers from the closed accounts. As for Shift, we at least got a notification by email before we found out on our own: [
Bitpay staff have said that the bank didn't even notify them that the cards were being closed, and still have not told them which accounts are closed. Reason # one million to starve the banks out of existence. At best this behavior causes inconvenience, at worst it can be life threatening for some people.

In case this isn't obvious....it didn't occur to me until the moment it was necessary. I had other non-crypto debit cards, so I found a Localbitcoins seller who would make an ETF transaction to my bank account. Then I took that debit card to a foreign ATM. In person cash transactions are sometimes hard to find and have higher fees. They are the most fun though.

Thanks James. I can only imagine how hard of a job you must have. For what it's worth, your communications have been the one inspirational bright spot in all of this. I hope you and Bitpay will live to see the day when the banks are obsolete.

If anybody from the Times is reading this.....who exactly did you ask for a reply?

As for volume info being unreliable, this has always been the case. Some percentage of the volume wasn't real 15 months ago and some similar percentage isn't real now. The point is that we're way up regardless.

The store is a German-based chain called Penny, that operates about 3,500 stores. I don't know if they have these machines in their other stores. If you tap the bitcoin logo on the screen it displays this: [

Thanks James, correct me if I'm wrong but your information about that link is either incorrect or the contact information is so far buried in the link that I never found it. At least 20 of my wasted minutes were spent clicking everything in that link trying to find a contact method. All the information I see there is just......information, no contact info regarding customer Bitpay cards. There is a contact for for sales inquiries but not for people having problems with their cards.

Sure thing. It is good that you're here answering questions. While BitPay has made an unfortunate choice for a partner bank, the Bitpay customer service is otherwise remarkably better than my experience with Shift. As other's have said in this post, in a perfect world these VISA bridges would not be necessary. In the world that we live in today, any crypto-spending traveler would be advised to have both a Bitpay and a Shift card. Shift truly has been usable anywhere I've been that VISA is accepted, but the daily limits are lower, and if you have a problem with your Shift card it is VERY hard to contact customer service.

When people from other countries talk down to my Romanian friend, he tells them, "My people were already making wine while your people were still swinging in trees."
