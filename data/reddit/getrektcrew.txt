Except this is for developers, so if they're not familiar with all that they're going to have to be familiar with command line stuff, etc?? Doesn't make sense to me.. yet.

Well said. People get hung up on the idea that "you can't ban it, it's decentralized" blah blah. But it doesn't matter, because by regulating it to death, and going after the exchanges, they can effectively ban it by limiting its growth. No government, especially ones like China, when fully aware of the implications would allow a currency outside their control to become a major factor. All they have to do is go after the fiat to crypto choke points.
