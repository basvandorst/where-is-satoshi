I think that escrow services (the traditional third party entity model) are also prone to scamming, especially in the Bitcoin world. Instead of applying the same old same old we should start developing more of Bitcoin's features like **multi-sig escrow**. 
That way even if you use an entity "z" to be the judge he will just have a key which he can use to sign the transaction. In case of a dispute the coins can go back to you in case you want a refund or to go to the seller in case he delivered and has shipping receipt, etc. However, in most of the cases (2 out of 3 signatures) there is no need for the judge to be involved, as long as the seller ships and the buyer receives. An easy way to spot these kind of transactions is by looking at the BTC addresses - they start with a "3" instead of "1".
When talking about things like BFL I think that most of the people are also upset because they lost a lot of value due to the BTC price increase so I suppose they would have loved to have something like this running at the time. However the merchant should also be willing to take the risk of keeping the order in BTC until they deliver but in this case since we're talking about a very "intimate" BTC industry that wouldn't have been too far fetched (if pushed for at the right time).
We, the Bitcoin community, are the "market" around which these industries develop. If we can agree on the things that we want to see, the industries will naturally fulfill those requirements. If we remain in limbo we'll just see more of the same. To conclude there are very few (if any) wallets currently that have the multi-sig escrow protocol working properly. We have worked on implementing the multi-sig in our platform by default and we ended up building also a wallet that's enabling people to actually use this feature :/. It's been almost 5 years since the gensis block has been created and so far apparently no one cared too much about this feature (even if it solves a big problem). I'm curious to see if people will actually use this feature because if they will find it useful all the wallets will implement it fast(er) resulting in yet a point for Bitcoin in the "you can't do that with fiat" debate.
TL;DR Bitcoin actually *could* prevent something like that from happening if we would really *want it*. If we'd *want it* implementations of things like multi-sig escrow could easily be the defacto standard in BTC to BTC transactions.

Not sure why the Winklevosses got the headline. The other guys were more interesting than the twin Facebook playboys that decided to hoard BTC. 
Aside from that it is interesting to see this sort of discussions at this level although there wasn't any mention on how it can improve the lives of the people that are currently blacklisted from participating in a world economy or how it can be used for GOOD. This is definitely not the type of people that I want to build the future of Bitcoin.

I can't believe this actually was sponsored by VISA *facepalm* 
I think this is how an intro to Bitcoin should be made. People ask "what is Bitcoin" without understanding how crappy the current system actually is. Only when they understand that  they can appreciate the awesomeness of Bitcoin. 
This would turn the conversation/question "why would I use Bitcoin, when I have _________ (visa, paypal, etc)" to "why the fuck should I keep using this crap when there's Bitcoin? Tell me more about it".
EDIT: Now I finally understand why the banks offer me shiny things to get *their* branded credit card. &lt;_&lt; Pirates.
