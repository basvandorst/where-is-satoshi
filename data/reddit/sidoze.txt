Just because they protected their domain info doesn't mean they are scammers.....

Hey want to reply to this comment here?

Did you contact them and did they give you back your BTC? They stated in the above comment they can provide services if you are not located in US, are you? I see you sell pills and stuff, maybe they don't like that?  
Not defending them, just trying to see if you are the outlier or not.

Yeah but you could have made a fortune buying bitcoin earlier this year! Those others were all cheap before I had pubes.

As much as this sub hates on other alt-coins, it's actually a joke compared so some of the other subreddits.

ELi5 - on chain vs off chain payments?

You'd be surprised how many people still play.

Thanks! I've looked into coingate and on paper it looks like what I want, but online its full of either 5 star or 1 star reviews which is a red flag for me....

If you are buying a house with your gains sure, but how are they ever going to track a $1000 TV you bought?  It's just not enforceable for small purchases

Just start a new family in the Caribbean, you can afford it ;)

The root problem is that YouTube is a hella expensive platform to run, that has never, ever, turned a profit. Hence they are trying to do everything they can to help advertisers, which unfortunately has included an inconsistent application of their rules, and very little accountability on their part. 
In a perfect world someone would start a competing service, but with the costs involved its unlikely.

It's a great quote for all investing actually. Once it feels like "the right time" to invest, it's actually too late. To really see returns you have to be prepared to live in a loss for awhile.

No, but the market as a whole typically does over time.  Eggs in baskets and such

False dichotomy.  
Outside of Monopoly, monopoly money doesn't have any value. Are you saying that it should be considered money?  
In Canada we have Canadian Tire which gives you Canadian Tire money, again only with value in the store. Is it money?

Actually in most societies, no, you do not have the right to say that, and I’m going to sue you and it’s on you to prove what you said is true. 
There are always reasonable limits to free speech in order for a society to function, slander/libel fall under that category. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:41:00
Do you have an example of that?

Had a little chat with one of the guys who run the only bitcoin atm's in my city. He said that they had to limit per hour how much you could buy because tons of foreigners (Asian money) are showing up with $30K and just feeding it into the machine.
