Just for info. I got the coinbase card in the UK just to see how well it works. Only did one transaction using my btc wallet.  Bought a coffee which was priced £2.20.  Card transaction worked fine, just like any normal card. Got a popup from the coinbase card app confirming purchase on my phone instantly.
Date of purchase 25th June 19 @ 11:51 UK time.
BTC cost for purchase = 0.00025 btc
Coinbase BTC price at the time = £8,841.26
Gbp equivalent of btc = £2.21
Coinbase fee for transaction = 0.000006 (£0.05)
So 6p (about 2.7%) fee.
I'm not planning to use it regularly, but it was funny seeing my gbp balance had *increased* after the purchase. (btc was bull running at the time)

No, I can only select from the available crypto wallets. The fiat accounts aren't available to select as a source.

Their article links to bitcoin(dot)com, no surprise they are confused if this is what they use for research....

Bitcoin is software. Software gets upgraded. In your examples iOS is always the operating system so I'm not sure it's a great example for your argument.
If newer, better standards or techniques are developed bitcoin could likely incorporate them into its code.

Exactly this. I sold my old motorbike for some btc last year. A mate wanted the bike and we're both holders. Super easy.

Seems to me you stopped too early...
You'd be getting much more bang for your buck for you had 'invested' within the last 4 months.  Lol

Its certainly possible to run your own node and connect /control it remotely on a mobile or desktop wallet app.  You need to be able to open certain external ports on your node server to allow connections though.  I'm running a raspberry pi node at home and connect using Shango for android. Works great!

Great read.  Thanks for posting this and for all the hard work you (and the other contributors) have put into this amazing piece of software! ��

It is useable.  Just for outgoing payments though.  (i.e. for spending btc over LN)
If you aren't looking to spend bitcoin, and only receive via LN - then you wont need to create an outgoing channel, just get an incoming one.
Once you start receiving btc over LN, you will then have a local balance which you can either use to spend (or move to another LN wallet), or you can close the channel to release the locked btc.

Btc pie looks like it's just removed the 'Unknown' section from the Blockchain pie, and re-weighted to 100%
No idea what's going on with the last one though...
Edit: Could be they can see more 'Unknown' than Blockchain?  The ratios on the known pools look about the same on all 3 I think.

I could be wrong but is this not a similar incentive to mining, or staking a masternode?  Effectively anyone could do this couldn't they, not just the banksters?

Yeah that's right. Not sure why it's not working for you. Try clicking the links (more info, balance, etc) in the tip ot response for more info.
I had it not work for me a few times...

I use 'Secure Folder' on my Samsung s8. It's basically a pin/password protected area of your phone. Add the Google authenticator app into Secure Folder and run it from there onwards.   
Only pain is that it sees any app installed in the secure folder as a fresh install, so you will need to add all your 2fa's back in initially, but they stick from there on.
Not sure if iphone has anything similar....

Nice little selection of kit.  That'll look great once up and running.  Enjoy the build! ��

Assuming you already own the ASIC(s) and have solar panels in place and have already made enough profit to cover those initial expenses, the yeah... $0

What, do you keep ALL your BCH in a hot wallet?
I'd highly recommend against that unless you only have a small amount you're happy to lose.... 
Even forgetting about LN, I keep my crypto safe in cold store, and top up my spending (hot) wallet from there when needed.
Why does the concept of topping up a spending/hot wallet make LN a joke in your eyes? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:52:29
Many thanks!

I'd be interested in how you achieved that, and what it actually gave you related to your local node (if anything)?  
I have a local LN hub running and LndHub freshly installed - I'm just falling over at the config.js settings.  The GitHub readme is pretty light on detail for noobs...

It seems it started with 3 bitcoin enthusiast developers who just wanted to make a really good wallet since nothing decent was available:
In their telegram chat they do mention they are developing an integrated 'Marketplace' browser in future versions of the wallet app, so that'll probably be a potential revenue stream for them.
They might also be pulling in some sat-fees here and there too, being custodial
Edit:  I hate when people start a post-reply with 'Apparently' and I just did it.  Couldn't leave it....

My very young son (2) and my reasonably old dad (72) have one bitcoin each, so I wouldn't exclude them from the calcs....

Delta is also the name of the app he screenshot.
Clever....
