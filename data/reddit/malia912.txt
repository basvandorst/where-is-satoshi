But the key difference being in a democracy there are laws to protect people's rights. Can't say the same with an authoritarian government, communist or not.  
We're swaying off topic here. I'm not here to discuss  economic  systems.

HOW is XRP even related to this discussion? Other than being just another cryptocurrency. I did check online for answers but most of them are outdated. I wanted to know if there's something new that being developed that can solve this issue. Or there's something thise articles missed.

That doesn't make sense to me. Could you explain better?
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:53:57
