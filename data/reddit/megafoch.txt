yes it can, but your wallet being stolen is totally in your control, it's your fault. Meanwhile waking up with your money gone and you couldn't have done nothing to prevent it, that sucks a lot more.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:12:01
and 1 week ago it was at 60$... you can't know.
Also 153$ isn't 160$ ; that's a pretty big difference.

Still feeding people, but not feeding as much now.
@_date: 2013-04-25 10:44:59


Why? A BTC isn't even close to 200$
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:02:11
how can I get started with mining with them???? pls
@_date: 2013-08-28 22:49:10
I was thinking about actually saving a little more money and getting the ATH M50, they are 150$ on amazon but only 100$ on ebay, so if I could find a way to buy stuff on ebay with bitcoin it'll be great
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:40:12
from 250$ to 105$ in 2-3 hours.. nope nope something .. something denial something something denial

oh, the circle jerk
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:11:21
not addressed because the most of them can't be addressed, they are simply true
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:58:28
stupid dumbass. I always get all fuzzy and happy when people get burned for being greedy
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:43:42
I want bitcoins fast I don't care
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:45:32
what software do you use to make this?
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:56:15
is there giftcards for ebay?
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:41:50
It was 150, then dropped to 135, then to 90.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:59:18
I searched raze headset and they gave me like 500+ items and no razer product on first page.
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:54:52
how do I know how much bitcoin i've made before getting payed?
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:44:20
I'm counting 4.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:33:54
20,073% to be more precise.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:44:12
I prefer paypal since 70% of my money can't just disappear in 4 hours.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:54
Either way, I'm going to sell all my bitcoins anyways, because this is a joke. How can I take it seriously when a simple DDOS takes 40% of its value?
What a shame.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:04:35
the denial is strong with this one
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:33:42
I wan to mine for btcguild to get bitcoins faster
@_date: 2013-07-07 10:57:25
aka. How to be in denial when you lose money
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:35:49
what stability? it was 150$ 2 weeks ago and it dropped 60$. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:57:41
more like time to get the fuck out, bitcoin just lost more than half it's value and it's crashing.
@_date: 2013-04-20 13:05:08
and that is why people, bitcoin is a joke!
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:29:46
I'd buy from bitcoinstore if the shipping wasn't costing as much as the headset I want to buy.
@_date: 2013-08-29 07:31:52
is it legit?
@_date: 2013-07-13 14:48:39
I checked, they don't sell spotify codes.

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:25:03
We should probably let them kill themselves if they were as stupid to buy bitcoins.
