I know the guys who run this company, NOT a pump and dump. They are legitimately interested in investing in the bitcoin space. I'll ask them to come and do an AMA if you want. They are really smart guys who understand the market and see genuine opportunity.

To your points:
1. We agree they are smart.
2. How it looks: Your description is accurate, but perhaps there is an alternative explanation other than "this is a pump and dump". 
By way of example:
You operate, and own a significant share of, a very small company that invests in mining and natural resources in Canada. You see a similar opportunity in bitcoin, i.e. it's a commodity/currency similar to gold, but with certain properties superior to gold. You decide to establish a beachhead in the bitcoin space because it is similar to areas in which you  are already active, namely precious metals mining. You do so, and make a press release. Stock goes apeshit because of bitcoin craziness, but low float and lack of liquidity make you look like a "pump and dump" stock. You are unaware of reddit, and certainly didn't post to reddit, so you are unable to defend your decisions in this forum. 
Since I know the people involved, I know that the above scenario is actually the case, but I do not expect you to believe me. Instead, we can go ahead and let this play out. If they dump their stock, then your assessment will be proven correct. Also, you guys can upvote my post, ad I will do my best to convince the officers of this company to do an AMA, and you can ask them directly.
