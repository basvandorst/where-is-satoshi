Gaius Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator was assassinated on the 15th of March, 44 BC (not BTC!). He received a warning beforehand from a seer that he should "beware the ides of March", which he didn't... so a foul fate befell him.

Definitely! The thing about money is that its presence and abundance doesn't necessarily give you happiness, but its shortage and absence does a lot to make your life miserable!
I have a portfolio where real estate takes up a lot of my net worth right now, this runs in the family (I have inherited some and bought some). I got into Bitcoin a bit late, but managed to time it so that my original investment has paid itself with some coins left over after cashing out, so after all I am happy to have my investment back, anything else is just icing on the cake (maybe for my children).
We are right now in the middle of moving into a larger family house from a flat, so I can imagine your delight to have somewhere nice to live! Best of luck and happiness to you!

The year hasn't ended yet... BTC can still somehow manage to pull off the fifth doubling. 
If you are looking at the one-year period past, then the price would have to be at $25000 to have the five-time doubling today.
Not saying that this is sustainable, just that it is doable. I am also waiting for the dip that seemingly never comes :) to buy more.

I have sold my LTC when it was $54, not believing it to climb up, also got rid of almost all of my ETH at $350. Fortunately I HEDL on to BTC from the selling, so sometime later I could cash out my initial gamblevestment (plus some little profit). Whatever is left, can go either to the MOON or hit zero, I am playing and HODLing calmly!
A few days ago I found some ETH in one of my Trezor accounts which I forgot about, so effectively "past me" prepared myself a pleasant Christmas present! :D

I did the same... bought BTC for around 4k. Unfortunately I blew half of my BTC on ETH and LTC (and some small amount on pump-and-dump coins), and only ETH gave me some good returns. I gave up on both of the alts and the "shitcoins" after a while and redistributed everything into BTC. Now I am "only" about 40% up from my original investment.

That is a bit too much... also, you cannot "contract" cancer, it is not an infectious, contagious disease.

Bitcoin Private fork is around the corner... 28th February.

Yes, but MtGox is required to sell those BTC to reimburse at least some of the people who lost theirs at the hack. If you get hacked, not an exchange, there is no-one that will reimburse you...

It means "Attention!" in Russian (the military command). :)
However, I think the name originates from the ancient Greek city (now Izmir in Turkey).
