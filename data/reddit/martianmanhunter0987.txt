This is wishful thinking. 
The biggest threat before Bitcoin is the US government and there are good chances that they will go after Bitcoin sooner or later. What would matter is the nature of the move. They will not go after Bitcoin directly but they might hurt the companies such as Coinbase that hold Bitcoin.
Bitcoin at the moment is a bit fragile. To make it anti-fragile it needs mainstream adoption. When Amazon and your local milkman starts accepting Bitcoin it is going to be anti-fragile and government proof because any government move then hurts large voter population. 
Best you and me can do to achieve this is to help others invest and accept bitcoins.

I started working with a company recently that does risk modelling for its existence. I realised how clueless and scared the establishment is because of Bitcoin. The presentations about Risk modelling Bitcoin were outright ridiculous as they simply tried to copy what they understood about stock markets, options, forex etc. and tried to apply to it to Bitcoin.
My theory however is that risk modelling that you apply to traditional investment systems does not apply to Bitcoin. Most other systems such as stock market are in a stable state. One big component of stock markets is "how many new people are going to start investing this year" does not change much. With respect to Bitcoins the number of people who will continue to invest is going to increase rapidly over next 2-3 years resulting into increase in value. 
There are other risk factors but in my opinion the "growth" is what most people miss.

I am an Indian and not offended by the term "third world". India is a pretty much a third world country with insanely high number of people unable to even find a toilet to shit in. 
Calling India third world only makes us Indians realise that we need to do better. Using politically correct phrases like "emerging" "developing" etc. is pretty much glossing over the reality. 
Note: India might be third world but the sheer number of people makes it $2T economy and it is will be around $20T in next 25 years.

The biggest danger of next 50 years is not global warming or AI taking over us but US defaulting on its debt. The day US defaults on its debt is when the shit will hat the fan. Of course US can also print more money and screw all us. That is why Bitcoin is a good investment. It will remain a scarce commodity.

Bitcoin remains a very risky investment but most of these people are what Taleb calls "Intellectuals Yet Idiots". Most of them are not hardcore techies who simply loved the notion of Bitcoin/Blockchain and the wonderful world of cyberpunks. These morons only pretend to be "know it all". 
Remember when Paul Krugman warned us that Internet will soon be dead ? I would rather trust people who have some skin in the game than those who are merely commenting from distance. I had no clue about Bitcoin and honestly I am not the optimist type but I decided to learn by investing some hard earned money and being part of various communities and actually writing code. 
I now realise that Bitcoin here is to stay. I have no idea who good an investment it is but as a technology it is pretty solid and will outlast many of these morons.

Stocks represents a portion of an entity (corporation) which means you own a % of their buildings, cash holding and other assets. Stock is backed by a real asset.

What does banning Bitcoin mean ? 
- Your country is closed to multi-million dollar exchange companies and thousands of related jobs. 
- Your country will not develop blockchain talent and will lag behind in that technology. 
- When you will think of reversing the policy you will be too late. 
- You create blackmarkets and pissed off attitude against government.

There is little doubt that the establishment wants to ban it but there is a last mover advantage here. If USA does not ban it then no other ban really matters. By banning Bitcoin in your tiny country you are just making your country backward while the world marches on. 
If US wants to ban it then a lot of American companies which are over billion dollars going to go out of business. This will cause problems for investors, employees and several American investors. The amazing thing about USA is the lobbying. I am pretty sure Coinbase and others have already retained a lobbying firm to ensure anything related to Bitcoin is scuttled in Congress. Politicians are like vending machines. Yout put a coin and they give you what you want. 
Any kind of regulatory move will only legitimise Bitcoin more. It might cause a short dip but it will also pave way for institutional investors who will enter because of this "legitimacy". It will also de-risk Bitcoin from government heavy handedness. 
The government officials wont understand Bitcoin. They will take the path of least resistance of putting some arbitrary regulation to give a sense that they are doing their job. Other than causing a minor dip it wont have any impact.
