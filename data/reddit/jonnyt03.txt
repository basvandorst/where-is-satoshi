Hopefully this is a sign to come with FanDuel having weekly Bitcoin tournaments. They may be testing the waters here
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:57:16
Maybe it’s a minority thing
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:53:17
That was a great idea. I wish I could talk my league into that
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:52:30
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:57
On coinbase?
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:49:22
BRD looks really nice! I don’t use it but for a mobile wallet, looks like they would be a top pick for me

@_date: 2017-08-18 15:11:28
Try using Bitquick 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:47:07
When the government(FBI,US marshals) auctioned off 30,000 seized Bitcoin from Silk Road they basically were acknowledging BTC as valuable assets. I wouldn't think if it were a pyramid scheme they would have partaken in this
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:59:55
You want it

@_date: 2017-08-13 12:54:47
Where at in Brooklyn?
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:30:36
Bitquick 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:06:13
What school and Country?
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:04:34
Any thoughts on the impact this will have?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:43:39
Convince her now to sell a kidney to buy at this great price!
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:52:25
How long does it take to import external wallet? This shit has been searching for like 15mins now
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:32:19
Yeah I had to rewind to confirm what I thought I saw.

[I'm seeing RED]( 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:34:15
If your high fluctuates like the price I’m not sure how enjoyable that would be
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:30:59
BS anybody I give my account number to should be able to deposit cash into account 
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:07:07
Yeah I’m sure it’s a huge problem if people randomly depositing cash into other peoples accounts. �� They are doing it to stop the local bitcoin transactions 
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:17:59
It sucks!
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:16:06
The guy that settled and bought into the cheapest BTC ATM franchise and was guaranteed a prime location with high traffic.
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:32:31
Is it less fees through bread wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:49:31
Have you cashed out from this site? Pretty legit? Does it ask for a lot of personal info?
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:34:10
Maybe LTC is the butt of this joke....lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:58:02
What gambling site do you use
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:06:39
Right on...treat it like a 401k or IRA. Start buying what you can afford every paycheck no matter what the price is at time
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:31:09
You should move your LTC. Unless it's not a significant amount
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:48:55
You’d be surprised how many people are willing to paying this high premium 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:35:23
My brother believes it was created by Aliens. Basically seeing our current system failing and helping us by giving  this advanced tech without exposing themselves. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:44:06
Main Stream is catching on! Might not ever dip now
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:13:15
Go for it. I'm assuming this place is similar to localbitcoin where u set your own price
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:26:37
Also I thinking he gave the 700k prediction a 1% chance of happening 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:33:39
I'll back him up. I fell for a similar site called BITRUSH.

That curry goat will be spoiled by the time the transaction is confirmed!
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:41:07
I'd be at that landfill every day until found and I'm sure my friends would be there with me
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:39:34
Is it showing transaction of them taking it?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:05:38
Betmoose. You can also create your own bet
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:56:06
Where did he post his address?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:10:34
Right and I always wondered how the business accept when the transactions take so long
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:38:08
Hopefully it wasn't a lot. That's why you don't leave on an exchange
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:44:51
The trend has always been up. Even if it goes down significantly it will reach that price again eventually. If your planning on holding for future, there is no better time than now. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:26:30
What's the difference in selling gold coins on eBay or BTC on localbitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:37:17
The mobile site has had issues last 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:36:33

Magic cards payed off big!
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:56:34
Wish I had a teacher bring that up!
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:58:26
Good read. Hopefully somebody creates a decentralized crypto exchange so we can do away with them as well, if that's even possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:55:46
Unbelievable! Awesome story....
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:35:09
Bitquick... Cash deposit in sellers bank, BTC  held in escrow. At times you can find really good deals sometimes even below market price!
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:14:11
Please and Thank You
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:24:22
Gotcha but my Bitcoin isn't in electrum. Just wondering if anybody had an idea like $3 will get it there in 6hrs 6$ there in 12hrs etc.
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:07:18
[This one]( 
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:03:31
Great story! Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:41:59
This is all really great stuff! Thanks for the responses. Without social media being so big back then was curious how everybody got there source. Anarchist site and guy searching for alternative payment for penis enhancement are awesome!
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:45:39
Crazy! Thanks
