 I entered this space late last year because I had a few clients that wanted Skyhooks, but I couldn't recommend them based on several factors. I started working with a small team to correct the problems, but then it just made more sense to start over from scratch. I won't list all the changes here, please take a look at our Crowdfunder  and let me know if you have any questions at all.

Hey really want to thank you so much for the mention. I did followup on this page that very same day, but as you know I suffered a setback on Thursday when I had to recall our first test machine from its location in NY. I've since been entombed in my office working on not only resolving that issue, but getting our next gen machine ready for testing. All is well now and I just posted our first video  of the Gen-2 that I recalled (turned out it was just a kernel update that disabled the touchscreen, nothing more). Gen-3s arrive tomorrow and I'm hoping to start testing them in NYC and ATL this week.

again, sorry for the delay. although i've been signed up for a few years, this is actually my first time posting on reddit. so i may be slow in the beginning (as i learn the ropes), but i promise not to take 3 days to respond in the future. also, support for the concierge will be handled by a dedicated team.
