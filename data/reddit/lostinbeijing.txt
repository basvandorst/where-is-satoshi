Really? Depriving content creators of their legal rights causes no harm?
Respect for individual property rights is a foundational principle of libertarian philosophy. It's amazing how quickly people forget that when there's a new season of The Walking Dead to download.
“Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave”
― Ayn Rand.

You understand what a "right" is don't you?
In a free country people don't get to deprive you of them with supercilious arguments.

Copyright does not protect ideas, it protects works.
It protects things that people have produced by their own time and effort. If I paint a painting why should only the canvas and the paint have value - they're just things. The image itself is a product of myself as a person. Why should there not be rights attached to it.

Won't be rushing to sell them but I might need the money.
I'm waiting to see what happens when the bitcoin funds get set up later in the year. Hopefully that will get the price over $1000 again.

Seems like a happy day for people who believe in digital rights as yet another criminal that has openly violated the legitimate rights of content creators to earn an income from their work is finally facing up to justice.
I'll support a starving person stealing a loaf of bread or a dying person stealing life-saving medicine but supporting people that want to illegally download Games of Thrones for free ... give me a break.

Well I'm guessing it stands for SoftWare REGistration.

He's not going to jail for the current version of his website. He's going to jail because in the early days it absolutely did contain copyrighted works. And he's going to jail for less than a year which I'm guessing is less than you'd do for armed robbery.
And let's not pretend he did this out of the goodness of his heart. He used pirated content to attract users and made money from the advertising.
These guys are just parasites and I don't understand why people are always rushing to defend them.

Nothing fake about it.
