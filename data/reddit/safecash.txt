I don't know what their company's name was. If anyone remembers, you can check here: 
Coin.mx is not on the list, but it is listed by company name or DBA name.

OK... if that's true. Not that I think anyone should be arrested for money laundering, but I do expect it to happen. Why wasn't anyone working for HSBC or Wells Fargo arrested? Somebody was doing illegal things.

[Ross]( was convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering &amp; hacking, *not selling weapons, fraud or hiring assassins.*

That ^ is not correct = my original point. The reason I made that point was because you're ~~slandering~~ libeling Ross by saying that, and it is counterproductive to say inaccurate things like that if you seek to put a happy face on bitcoin for the masses. That's all I was getting at. 
Libeling Ross technically makes you a criminal too (were you to be convicted), so I don't know why you seem so hateful toward Ross' perceived criminality.
Just because gizmodo.com reports that stolen credit cards were available at SR, does not mean they were. They were not. Ross committed no real fraud I am aware of.


I did not make him out to be innocent. He's just not guilty of certain things you make him out to be guilty of.


He is not a *real* criminal. He will probably spend the rest of his life locked up against his will. I'm sure it will often be miserable. He probably does not belong there.

Totally untrue.

My point was that YOU were saying things that were completely wrong about a high profile person that you are asserting gives a bad name to bitcoin. Doing that is counter productive if you want to give bitcoin a good name.


I don't do that. I think its entirely reasonable for the media to portray things like that since there has been so much "criminal" activity surrounding bitcoin. I'm not trying to play semantic games. I'm just being logical.
I think the way to promote bitcoin to the masses and overcome those stimgas is education, education, education. Bitcoin was basically kick started because SilkRoad required its use. The SilkRoad made bitcoin famous. That's a fact. I don't mind that. Bitcoin would not be anywhere near where it is today in terms of adoption if not for SilkRoad. So for all his flaws, I think we should all thank Ross for getting Bitcoin off the ground.
In my opinion, bitcoin is on a fine course already for massive, main steam, worldwide adoption.

Interesting. So why do you figure the the FBI isn't arresting [HSBC]( &amp; [Wells Fargo]( execs? I guess knowingly, actively facilitating money laundering is OK if your company is big enough, but don't even try to cut corners it if your company is not a giant mega bank.
