Perfect! Want to PM me a postage address and I can put together a quote for You?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:26:03
Yeah go for it, I'm sure a print out of a picture taken on a phone would look sweeeetttt ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:38:08
Yes sorry,I tried linking to my Etsy site with all the details on it but it kept getting removed!
So this is the main part of the description...
The poster features all the words from the Bitcoin whitepaper written by the great Satoshi Nakamoto (expect for the section relating to mathematical equations) in the shape of the Bitcoin logo.
The poster itself is printed on white, A3, single sided, high-gsm paper to give the look and feel of a truly quality piece of artwork.
Price-wise, it's $15 + shipping (prices vary depend on location). Crypto is the preferred and easiest payment method - but I have an Etsy page for people who would prefer that method.
Let me know if you have any other questions :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:36:50
Yeah I know :) the actual poster looks pretty cool but my current phone doesnt take great pictures
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:38:43
Hey, see my other comment :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:35:14
hi everyone, I just wanted to post and say that I'm the guy that posted the Bitcoin whitepaper poster about a week ago. Anyway it took off and I've decided to open an Etsy shop. I've just added a range of Bitcoin phone cases which you can get 10% off with code BTC10
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:27:46
All except the equations part - it didn't look nice with that in
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:52:04
Yeah it is just Photoshop :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:04:56
Thanks, I had to teach myself how to use the software, so all in all about 5-6 hours :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:36:51
I'm in England so I'd be happy to post :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:39:23
Ahhhh, a shirt is a great idea!
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:59:20
Sure, it's on my other laptop so I'll do it tomorrow morning (GMT)
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:48:21
The printers had a minimum order quantity so I've got a few spare if you're actually interested?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:16:50
That sounds outright horrible. Nothing more important than regular bowel movements, glad it got sorted!
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:04:02
Thanks for the heads-up!
Here's the cross-post: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:04:16
Haha! So is there likely to be some warning before the decision is reached? Or could we all just wake up one morning to find it's happened over night? I'm guessing there will be some general consensus that it will happen before it goes.
Also, my understanding is that under a HF owners of bitcoin end up with the same amount of both chains, is there a guide anywhere stating what an owner of a bitcoin should do at that stage? I'm not looking for trading advice here, but I'm curious how I would access the second set? Where would the wallet with those coins sit exactly? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:50:07
I was expecting as much! That's a shame!
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:23:19
This would be really useful! As someone who is fairly new to the space, having a relatively equal platform for discussion would make things a lot clearer! 
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:00:29
Next they won't be safe on paper.
Then the thought police will get access to your brain wallet and we'll all be screwed
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:58:21
Hmm this is an interesting one that I'd never have thought of.
Not sure it's relevant for how I've had things set up in the past but I'm definitely going to dig into this further then. Between this and diversification it does begin to kind of make sense I guess.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:46:10
Awesome thanks, I wanna be as secure as possible without going full hog as I'm not naturally a cautious person.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:11:54
Why would you need to get a second as a replacement? Couldn't you just buy a second one when the first one fails?
Or is it a back up approach?
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:01:48
Purely cold storage. I have BRD on my phone for spending but I rarely find places that accept crypto so I'm not too fussed about being oriented for spending.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:18:15
So I'm likely going to store multiple different cryptos on the hardware. Some core coins like bitcoin and Ethereum and some utter shitcoins.
If I do the above for bitcoin but don't follow the same protocol for the others do I negate the benefits?
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:45:11
The diversification makes sense to me I guess but it feels overkill.
Especially since I'd feel it's more likely to lose/forget multiple login details than for one of the big name companies to have their hardware compromised
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:32:18
Do you have access to your own 3D printer or is there a website you can order from?
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:04:12
Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:30:41
It's all the words from the whitepaper. It's really clear and readable in person but it's almost impossible to tell by this picture haha
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:04:37
Cheers, yeah it's the full whitepaper, it's really readable in person and I think it looks really cool!
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:05:04
great idea!
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:03:58
The printer had a minimum order quantity and I'm looking to sell some if you're interested?
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:40:41
Yeah, it's the entire bitcoin whitepaper in English :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:57:22
That's fair enough, gonna be a pain in the arse though so I'd prefer to avoid it if possible. So can you recommend a platform that I can use to create a paper wallet please?
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:39:23
This is super cool dude thanks! I've implemented the ccprice but I can't figure out the 24 hour change, any chance you could help me please? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:27:29
Thanks! For anyone else interested I had to use percent_change_24hr throughout rather than "24hrchange" but other than that this works perfectly, thanks :) ! 
I've been trying to learn as well, I was so close haha! I'd done all these things but not all in the same iteration.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:02:01
Fees are 7% for buy and 5% for buy. The article refers to it as a 'lifestyle store' unfortunately it's actually a cornershop called Lifestyle Express.
Brilliant marketing on their behalf, I'm now considering driving 10 miles just to visit a cornershop!! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:33:03
Thanks for answering. I have one more if you don't mind :)
Does reducing the difficulty directly reduce the time between blocks? 
This way rewards are given mire often, but each reward is a smaller amount, right?
