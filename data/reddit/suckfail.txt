You also said you took a second mortgage:
And then you also said you've been in since the beginning and made a lot of money:
What's wrong with you. Why do you crave attention. Shut up.

You're a drama queen. Go back to 4chan.

Gold has been used in the exchange for goods and services since the beginning of humanity.
The fuck are you talking about. It was one of the original currencies.
That's why there was so many gold backed currencies.. Have you never heard of that either?

Like.. yourself? You can't even call this "investing." What's your DD, "it went up a bit before"? There's no EPS, no CEO, no quaterlies, no product, nothing.
If it's truly a currency then it's not even a security. And if it's a "store of value" then it has no use since it can never actually be used for anything other than storing value.
This is straight up speculation. There's no rhyme or reason, no rationality, and certainly no "investment." It's even got market manipulation via this sub. If everyone is bought into the "HODL" meme it means the value is being manipulated up through scarcity. If everyone on here panic sold the price would plummet, like you often see with stocks. And to top it off, these "exchanges" go down whenever there's a big sell off like an artificial circuit breaker. Amazing.
Doesn't mean you can't make real money though!

I'm using coinsquare. It's my first experience with a crypto exchange.
It's alright, but pretty ass compared to a regular exchange that does stocks imo.

Sorry this is a bullshit argument. If you go back 1 year even in this sub BTC was heralded, rightly so, as a **currency**.
Then as soon as it became clear it couldn't handle the # of transactions occuring, everyone started parroting store of value, commodity like gold.
I don't hold any BTC or Bcash, I've got no dog in this fight. But come on guys. Be honest with yourself.

You'd have to send it to someone to inspect it. But of course if you do that and it's not encrypted and they figure it out, they could also take your BTC.
I work in software so I could probably figure it out, but I'm also some random person on the internet that you shouldn't trust.

Yes, those things we definitely have!

What? Why

If you are really just starting to invest, I suggest you check out or a personal finance sub instead of here.
Start with the stock market, then when you're comfortable move to something like crypto (with a small amount of money).

They have a value, namely being used in **the exchange of goods and services**, plus a government that is backing them. You may argue that government is corrupt, but nevertheless it exists.


Because it doesn't. If you have a traditional store of value, such as gold, it doesn't have to just sit in the vault. It could be used to make jewelry, weapons, electronics, medical equipment, even food.
What can Bitcoin do? You can't use it as a currency, and if you store it you can't use it for anything other than sending it to other people to store.
Do you not see this? Am I not explaining it well?

1. Buying bitcoin is not "investing." Be careful
2. A correction is when something is overbought and reduces in price back down to a mean
3. Bitcoin doesn't really have a mean. There's no core inflation, no asset, no corporation or product.
4. Be careful. BE CAREFUL.

Why the fuck does VISA care if BTC is accepted or not? They make a fuck-ton from money and do 20x the transactions BTC can do.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:43
It's a derivative, like options. Except with no actual BTC backing it.
It can affect the market since if there's huge downward pressure in the futures market, people may think the price will go down and start selling actual BTC. It's indirect.

I used their instant verification and it worked.
Did you try it?

Electricity in Ontario actually has one of the highest rates in the world. This is mostly because of poor investment choices into wind mills and other green energy as well as cancelled gas plants by our corrupt provincial govt.
Quebec is another story tho.

I don't believe Bitcoin is really good for anything. It can't currently be used as a currency, and it can't be a store of value since for something to be a store of value it must have some intrinsic value.
But that also doesn't mean you can't make money off of it. I hold a small amount of BTC (no other alts anymore) and will sell it in a few years.
I don't believe in the technology as it stands now, and I also don't really care about it. I mostly trade the stock market and options. But if people want to keep pumping money into this, why not make some money (and I assume this kind of thinking is a big reason why it keeps going up).

If you never sell, then why have it? Usually people spend a currency, so in your case I guess it's more like gold?
Except people usually also liquidate gold eventually.
I'm a little confused on how it has value if you literally never use it for anything.
