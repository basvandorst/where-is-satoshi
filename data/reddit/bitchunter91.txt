They dont. You decide it yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:55:36
Seems you know more than the rest of the world. Are you Mark Zuckerberg ?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:47:42
Except we are in the third week.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:50:21
No, sell please.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:32:13
Must be a double spend, sorry bra.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:33:27
What is bitcoin core ?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:08:33
So what is your plan to define lost keys ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:59:21
Now I am sure. You must be Warren Buffet.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:08:49
I see no gainz brah
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:10:45
This one got me rotfl: “Possibly we do need to look at the way we regulate this environment before the amount of outstanding bitcoin becomes large enough to be systemically important in the global economy,” he said. “It’s not there yet, but it could get there soon.”
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:58:14
And ps: you really dont understand anything of bitcoin. You could be Warren Buffet as well.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:29:37
So what exactly do you want us to do lol ?

Put a heat light on them.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:57:33
This pretty much sums up my colleagues talking 'bout crypto at the coffee corner.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:59:30
That's not really how it works mate.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:46:15
And I say Bitcoin 'An investible asset class'. So now what ?
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:57:35
Again ? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:46:47
Doh. Nobody helps digging their own grave.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:48:19
You must be drunk
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:49:03
Again ?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:27:15
So you let your 3 year old child draw some lines, and now what ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:24:48
1. 19.000
2. Yes
3. No
4. Yes
5. Yes
Because of bitcoin I am almost broke and homeless.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:12:10
Yes and no. A lot of btc get lost so nobody knows the true marketcap.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:15:30
Uhh, no.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:45
You must be really stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:10:20
Cool story. If so, why the hell are you even here.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:15:22
The jealousy is strong on this one
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:23:23
This is so funny lol.. These people have 0 clue on what they are talking about and still say 'it will crash tomorrow or later, I just don't know why because I have no idea how it works'. What is this shit doing anyway on a business program.
'Nobody knows how bitcoin works but I know that you need to get into bitcoin because it is just like the dotcom bubble and you can make some money on it'.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:48:23
Bitcoin will just adjust the difficulty lol..
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:57:56
Marketing bullsh*t..
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:33:05
just move all your funds from the same wallet to another wallet with a higher fee (300sat/byte) and it's confirmed in 15minutes (also the old transaction).
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:00
Rofl look at the sell wall.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:18:16
Yes we are all just a bunch of idiots and when 21 milion btc have been minded we just add 100+ mil extra for fun.. No of course not that's the point of btc lol.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:14:33
I hope so, so I can buy more on sale
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:41:26
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:27:36
O btw this one is the best:
'I will never invest in BTC because I only invest in things that get me an income like dividend'.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:22:00
This is FUD already as increasing difficulty does not result in longer block times than usual. It increases because the block times are too short currently lol. Learn the basics.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:26
We can't use people who are only focussed on the short term money making here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:46
this gunn be goooddd
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:10:56
Read my reply again please.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:15:44
The thing that puzzles me is how exactly they want to 'divide' satoshi's bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:18:07
Litebit is not a scam
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:10:35
They can make an episode of Narcos when the orderbook goes to matching mode.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:11:06
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:36:12
Paper wallet is the most easy one in this case
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:34:10
'bank' and 'competitor for Bitcoin' in one sentence = rofl
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:45:28
dude it has been 3 days since than, relax.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:02:49
You didnt get charged, you choose it yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:05:29
I'm ashamed to be Dutch
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:37
Ps: more fees, more miners, faster blocks &gt; lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:27:36
Calm down
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:12
It's coming down
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:42:37
you clearly have no idea how bitcoin works do you ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:57:40
Whichever you choose
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:13:23
Lol understatement of the year
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:42
Victim mentality.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:11:08
Correct but it takes a chunk out when a block is mined. Earlier today there were 290.000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:02:03
please print some more of those $.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:11:08
You must be drunk
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:06:20
It's true.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:06:42
Its not absurd. Its market working. Dont send if you dont want to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:02:47
Larger blocks are not solving the 'problem'. It's only increasing centralization. Whenever you are supporting larger block sizes you are virtually supporting centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:47:44
dat early bird
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:15:51
They can make a bloody episode of Narcos when the orderbook goes onto matching mode for BCH lol!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:30:42
I was about to say the same lol. Green lines all day, sell orders of 30btc are getting slammed like they are nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:00:02
I understand that if you transfer 1.000.000€ you dont care about the fee. Just want to be 100% sure it will be in the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:35:00
BTC would probably increase in value
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:00:29
LN is great. It's true. Instant transactions with almost no fee. Exactly like you wrote it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:11:45
Because you can't
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:59:37
Just imported the private key in MyCelium eventionally and spread the spents out over 3 btc adresses made offlife with bitaddress.org
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:31:47
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:50:32
If you could boost this transaction, many thanks! (open for 31hours already): ce1f9724798b9e16a1a1354c96c66120733aee486f601954fb8df6b6d2addaf6
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:31:01
I would sell ! Sell before it crashes to 0.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:55:19
That's the easy part. Just import the private key from your cold storage in mycelium. Only question I have: is it safe and how do I split my 1x paper wallet into 4x paper wallet ?
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:29:12
The whole point of bitcoin is that it is not about the people ..
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:52:07
Best explanation ever for dummy's.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:04:19
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:31:53
Wtf is bitcoin core
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:46:14
It's happening !!!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:09:06
Secure enough for small amounts of btc
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:36:57
And what about the decentralized part ? They could run a database instead which would be far more efficient for the purpose.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:31:40
This is not a problem so don't search for a solution.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:57:41
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:07:37
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:22:22
Thank you for your well backed up contribution to this sub.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:07:51
How many times have you asked this question ? Jeez.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:33:53
Yeah. So is the price.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:52:55
It's just forked of bitcoin because some people had a different opinion on how bitcoin should develop. That's not a crime. Decide for yourself which path you support.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:08:32
Here, of course.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:36:48
Dummies :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:08:58
If you really believe the last part of your post than you are just as stupid as the persons you mention.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:20:41
Probably at 300.000 miles.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:59:15
Yeah and also the bonusses of wallstreet and chinese new year in may, don't forget.
