Sure. You do need to be a bit careful not to sound evasive though - I struggled to connect some of the answers to the questions!

This article assumes alts are effectively clones (which of course many are), so doesn't give a particularly complete argument why BTC is the one.  Like his Gold and Silver argument, there could be various differentiating features of electronic money that make one or more preferred by different populations or applications.  For example: price stability, anonymity, ownership, dev management, security model.  The claim of BTC maximalists as I understand it is that it will be straight-foward to provide  all important functions of money with approaches that utilise BTC as store-of-value - e.g. stable derivatives, anonymous sidechains.  Additionally, the programmed scarcity underlying e-cash is strongest when there is only one coin.  Others claim that there will be features that cannot be optimally provided using BTC as store-of-value.  For example, people want to spread their worth across different currencies in case one fails.  They may not be so concerned about the importance of maintaining scarcity, given the historical diversity of currencies.

Voting pools feel like they would have significant amount of complexities in their implementation - managing and auditing software upgrades, outages, etc.  Are these being surmounted?  As I can see, this development is not on github?

This is interesting.  I think Vert might claim that Litecoin has dropped the ball wrt ASICs, and is implementing a scheme that will hold ASICs off for a reasonable amount of time while giving an explicit commitment to proactively resist ASICs into the future.  I suspect that decentralisation is a key issue, but successfully keeping it will involve a quite different PoW or PoS.

Yeah, also other forms of startup funding where you might nominally get equity, but where profits will come from is unclear.  I think with the better projects there is an expectation that there will be forks once the app gets going, but that these can be managed when the time comes...

I agree with you in general on the direction of things towards colored coins, OT etc.  But I think the appcoin thing is not a major issue. One can argue, as I think Vitalik sort of does, that one use of appcoins is as an ad-hoc funding mechanism, with the community opprobrium that would occur if devs leave the initial purchasers out of pocket enough to ensure reasonable prospect of profit if the project succeeds. This is "ugly", and has potential complications, but I'm not sure it is hugely different from some other forms of funding of startups, where the assets are negligible, mechanisms for payout are not clearly specified, and recourse is limited if the thing is a scam.

Appreciate the work greatly!

Are you referring primarily the arguments outlined in [James' blogpost]( That Bitcoin can't support the required fine-grained microtransactions?  Or that a specialised coin can help with provide network activity information.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:37:44
Why specifically an order of magnitude?
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:02:36
Most (here) think the Poelstra article is the end of the story and is old news.

Great post.  It seems like open transactions is getting into gear with StashCrypto.  It seems like Liquid is likely to usurp many of its innovations, although there may well be benefits of OT being nominally distinct from Bitcoin?

Time will tell if this relies on an overly narrow vision of blockchains.  Are there any interesting analogies for POW/POS in real world security? It seems there are a variety of tricks for efficient security that belie simplistic arguments for the need for, say, huge armies.

Weird - he seemed the absolute heart of this company.  Is there a chance it's simply a move away from software engineering to a different role in Open Transactions ecosystem?   Closed source doesn't make much sense if you're working on voting pools.

Would you say this also addresses the use cases claimed by OT? Thanks
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:50:37
As I understand it, the Monetas software was initially a re-implementation of OT, but has possibly diverged somewhat.  Hopefully the two projects will remain close enough to benefit from parallel development..
@_date: 2015-10-11 00:16:13
This sort of general approach has promise, but the "Monetas platform" does not seem to have been described in any detail anywhere.
@_date: 2015-10-09 08:08:27
That's a maximum value.  As I understand it, it's something like a flat 1% with a cap.

Do you know if this has this been used for remittance in the past?  Are there immediate plans for on-ramps out of Tunisia?

In typical penny stock scams most aren't running around trying to trick anybody either.

This seems more like open transactions to me (now stashcrypto) - which has been working on things similar to this for years.

Greg Maxwell's comment on your post suggests they essentially do!

I'd recommend not calling this sort of thing a whitepaper - sets up readers for disappointment:
