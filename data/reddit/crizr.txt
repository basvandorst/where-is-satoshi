Hopefully. At the same time though, a correction/dump could be an opportunity for more people to hop on board which could increase the price in the long run. It will be an interesting next 5 days.

Lol seriously though. They are making a fortune. Algorithmic traders are probably laughing at how much they are making right now.

Just because you're willing to lose your investment doesn't mean you shouldn't put safeguards in place.

Essentially, people can bet for or against the price of a cryptocurrency without actually trading the currency. Bob could bet Joe $25,000 that Bitcoin drops by a certain amount.

Because this rise is unprecedented. This could easily be big money pumping up the price for Monday so that they can dump and then short the price. Even if you ignore this, there's going to be a massive correction sometime in the near future. Setting a stop loss below the current price puts a safety net around your investment, especially because you can't rely on the exchanges to be stable around times of high trading volume.

It doesn't directly influence the price, but indirectly it can. After they've bet on a currency or before, big-time investors try and guarantee that the price will go up or down by manipulating the market. Normally this would be pretty hard to do, but since Bitcoin's market cap is pretty small (compared to the U.S economy), large buy or sell orders can have a pretty large impact on the momentum which impacts price.

That's fair. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:48
Depends on where you put it.

And if it keeps going up, then it doesn't hit your stop less. No issue.

Can't be sustainable. We should all put a stop loss at a comfortable level below the current price.
Edit: Can't be sustainable in the short run. Just be careful guys.

Yeah, it does drive the price way down, that's part of why the price is so volatile. You have day traders, banks, algorithmic traders, and regular people trying to take advantage of "relatively" small fluctuations in the price.

It was at 19k for a brief minute and crashed when gdax went down. Ridiculously volatile

My guess is that it wouldn’t be that low. I️ think you could pull out 100,000 without it affecting the price too much. On top of that, if you split your balance across multiple exchanges you might be able to pull out a mil every couple hours. However, that’s still a huge hassle, and I️ could totally see the futures market being a way to indirectly improve liquidity.

just to clarify: when using gdax this would then be a 0% transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:58:29
oh awesome, thank you.

Seriously, it's so brutal.
