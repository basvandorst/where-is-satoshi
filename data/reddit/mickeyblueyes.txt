yeah the thing is that if enough people failed to pass it on correctly, there is the potential for billions of lost value just locked up in cyberspace at some point. That sucks to think about. There's only so much to go around in the first place.

I'm glad to see young people taking an interest in the future and actually doing something about it. If you were my son, I'd listen too.

Good question. If you don't trust someone else enough with your key you might have to go through a conventional bank channel of having a safe deposit box that can only be opened by someone else on proof of death, or something along that line. Now we're back to dealing with stupid banks. Someone needs to devise a better solution.

That works in practical terms for small amounts of coin but if you have a large estate, you are condemning the beneficiaries to a ton of legal problems if it isn't done right. They'll definitely go after them on the estate tax. 
As much as I dislike 99% of them myself, we just have to have lawyers &amp; CPAs for some things.

Maybe an encrypted service or app even that requires two parts of a key to unlock. The beneficiary would have to produce adequate proof of death for the other half of the key holder to unlock your coin code to you. Damn this is all complicated all the sudden and I thought it was really going to simplify everything. You're right though, for the sake of the people you love, a person really needs a way to do this that can't be questioned later.

yeah I was thinking about that last night ... smart contracts might just do away with the lawyer in the process. You'd still want an accountant to figure out the tax stuff.

Cash app is easy and cheap.
