Mmm, no time value of money? I guess the price will reflect the likelihood of recovery and/or estimated time for bitfinex to come up with the cash to buy back the tokens. In the unlikely event that the ~120000BTC is recovered, at what exchange rate will these be converted? 
I was hoping for more.

Help me understand, am I right by thinking that if these tokens represent shares then if there were 1000 shares in issue prior to the hack, now there is (for example) 3000 shares in issue (1000 + 2000 new shares in issue, where the 2000 account for the tokens created) then all previous (pre-hack) shareholders of Bitfinex are diluted and are also 'partaking' in easing the burden ?

Not really the point, but okay.

It feels like people are forgetting that we have been able to short bitcoin for a few years now. Both on a futures market (BitMEX) and spot (BitFinex).

Let's use bits for bCash (as it is already retarded) and we can have mBTC/µBTC for Bitcoin.

I'd like to see what the price of gold does when we start mining gold asteroids, or if one lands on earth.

On  under bitcoin core, the Protocol Scaling Plan is listed as "SegWit + Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures, MAST". Is there a ELI5 of what MAST is/does?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:11:15
Nodes might be cheap, but there are almost 10x more Core nodes then BU nodes. 
Just for clarity, I'm not suggesting to do away with POW, just switching to a different type of POW.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:57:45
Doesn't segwit adoption create on-chain scaling and enable potential off-chain scaling? People don't have to use things like lightning if they don't want to + People don't have to use blockstream's lightning network, with segwit adopted we would be able to develop our own "lightning", or do I have something wrong here?
Let me be clear, I want limited on-chain scaling, but there are limits to what we will be able to achieve this way. We will also need off-chain transaction abilities.
Also, a concern I have with BU at the moment is their technical ability, especially in comparison to that of the Bitcoin Core team.
Please note that I'm happy to discuss the validity of Note 1 and Note 2, however, this post was meant to ask, if needed, are we willing (and able?) to change the SHA256 based POW algorithm to a different POW algorithm.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:28:37
You assume a binary situation where in fact we have several options for miners e.g. vote segwit, vote BU, vote nothing, etc.
My assumption "... except for the miners" comes from the fact that segwit adoption is currently at only ~27% 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:32:08
The threat of changing PoW to a different PoW algorithm that is incompatible with the current SHA256 mining rigs is what might be necessary to get seqwit adoption

Reference to research?
@_date: 2016-06-29 06:30:14
Agreed, there is no reason why big miners will be better connected than smaller miners. However, where big miners have an advantage is that they are more likely to mine the next block (B_n+1), which means that if they have just mined a block (B_n) they can start working on the next block (B_n+1) before anyone else can since they are still downloading block B_n.

I think everyone/most in this community is pro decentralisation and that is what we want. However, I want to know at what point are we starting to compromise decentralisation to an acceptable extent? How will the network look when we have 0.5mb blocks? 2mb blocks? 8mb blocks? If you think about it, anything over ~0mb blocks is compromising decentralisation to some extent.

Damn, I got caught clicking on this looking for some new insight, but was once again disappointed by this click bait!

I think we will create a wormhole between earth and mars for information passing so that subluminal communication can be used on both ends.

Yes. But anchor and close transactions enter blocks, which are large transactions, which will eventually require bigger blocks. As per the whitepaper at 
"10 Block Size Increases and Consensus:
If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one user will
make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able
to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances
(assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited,
and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in
the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard
fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to
participate in the network with the larger blocks.
While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block size
increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a
block size increase in the long term. "

Haha love the Arthur Hayes insert!
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:58:22


Wouldn't this require a block size increase?

Bill is wrong, the main feature of cryptocurrencies are that I'm in control of my money, no one else.

Awesome! Now please add support for using milli BTC and micro BTC - thanks!

In my opinion, most of his arguments enforce why you should not separate bitcoin from the blockchain in proof of work consensus networks.

I know this is a simplification, however to help my understanding I want to point out that since inputs can differ in amounts the two cases won't cancel out. That is, using a valid 0.1 BTC input together with a fake 0.9 BTC input, you have a 50% chance of losing 0.1 BTC and a 50% chance of being able to spend 1 BTC. Or am I missing something?

a while back I was in the same situation, except my phone got stolen. I was able to regain access to all of my accounts that are locked with 2fa, however it took just over a week. I now use 2 phones to backup my codes.
