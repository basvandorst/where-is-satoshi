There's a small list on the site, "choose a .bit enabled website" or something as a dropdown box.

8 specifically target nodes. The attacker went for those which they knew were storing private keys.

Use calibre. (Also, on at least Debian, the calibre-bin package contains the ebook-convert cli utility.)

Does that make it right?

They used Linode's VPS management to reset the password. The only thing they did was hack Linode/maybe be a Linode employee.
*(From memory, correct me if I'm wrong.)

Create a small socket server running as root which kills the server when it receives (extremely long string only you know), and have a short alias on each of your computers which runs a program to send that to it?
Of course, that's not something you should expect to have to do, at all.
Did Linode give you any different information about what happened that they didn't publicly state which you'd be allowed to share?

I'm not saying that it's not right, I'm saying that **Apple doing it** doesn't **make** it right.
I still dislike it, but it's not as much of a problem for the reasons you've given.

Looking at the change, if that was the case the rate of drop in hashing power would lead you to expect a greater decline - so mining isn't all that's been going on :)

I agree, the moderation can be rather awful, sometimes... :(
edit: I feel I should clarify, I like bitcoin, and I did like the forums, until, suddenly, what feels like any thread that could be bad for bitcoin was moved away from bitcoin discussion. Leaving other irrelevant things there. :s
edit 2: So many typos! Sorry :(

Probably a good idea to fix your formatting there.
Use "&gt;" the start of the line to indicate quotes on reddit. "&gt;&gt;" for an inner quote, or as many more as you need.

The other guy doesn't want to steal your coins, he was explaining how you could prove that you own a bitcoin address without sending any coins from it by using the key for the address to sign a message.
