So you think that the bitcoin market cap will be comparable to the size of global GDP?
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:42:33
What does that possibly have to do with anything.
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:06:29
I like how almost all of these options require trusting a central authority, making the use of bitcoin pointless.

You are obviously confused. I was talking about the original chart that btcfun posted, 
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:37:43
You're allowed to overestimate your tax liability. It was stupid to think these transactions wouldn't be taxable and neglect to record the details as they occurred.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:26:10
And it conveniently cuts off the downturn. Not a very useful chart and definitely not “the gold chart you need to look at”.
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:47:24
Where did I say that it wasn't a thought experiment? Why do you insist on ignoring what I said? It doesn't change the fact that you were justifying it in the way I said, even in the context of the experiment.

What would be the point of proving it for 5%? I don't think anyone believes that they have lost everything. Seems useless.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:46:41
The onus is on you to make money in ways that you can accurately record and calculate your tax liability on. You don't get a free ride because you complicated your income.

Let me flip it back around on you: I'm not the one saying that everyone I talk to lost money (or made a lot of money, for that matter) and saying that the recovery has been “poor” to justify a poorly diversified portfolio that is overweight on one high-risk venture.
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:19:39
“Seriously, there was no way to ever predict that I'd have to retroactively calculate the capital gains liabilities I may or may not have had each and every time I used BTC to buy lunch over the last year, or for the thousands of tiny deposits I received when mining alt coins on 50+ different mining pools during that same period.”
I could have told you this, several years ago.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:23:23
I'm honestly not sure how you thought that you wouldn't have to keep detailed records of your financial transactions for tax purposes. You don't have to be prescient to have worked that out.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:12:50
In what way do you believe that all of these quotes don't apply equally to good investments that will recover in value and bad investments that will never do so?
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:05:51
It's not going to be a steep discount if it maxes out at the payment processing fee.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:08:08
So you're saying that bitcoin is a fairly illiquid investment, with lots of restrictions on how and when you should trade it, and that you should sell it off over a period of ~3 weeks if you want to reduce your potential loss due to scams to 5%.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:17:09
I thought those uses only required tiny amounts of bitcoins to record and transfer ownership, decoupling the value of the asset completely from the value of the bitcoins that represent them. This use of bitcoin would have minimal to zero impact on the value of bitcoin.

Now they have bitcoin, where they pay conversion fees at both ends and then their money gets stuck in an exchange for an indeterminate time.

I was just confirming your position, I don't really want to get into a nuanced discussion about inequality and redistribution in a subreddit where the majority of people appear to believe that taxation is a great evil.

@_date: 2014-04-07 02:08:22
Why should the market cap of bitcoin be identical to that of Western Union, even if it were to take over all of its business? Western Union's market cap is due to the profit it makes on transaction fees; the same fees that people say will be much lower or non-existent using bitcoins.
The fees for international remittances in a bitcoin-based system would be captured by the exchanges on either end, so you could perhaps argue that these exchanges should have some fraction of the Western Union market cap in this hypothetical future.

If you can't get them to reallocate the money they spend on those things now, why do you think you will be able to ensure they cut spending to those programs and not others when their income decreases?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:41:47
So you're never supposed to buy or sell bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:29:00
Your reasoning there is obviously flawed. That the standard of living increased and, at the same time, there existed income inequality of a certain degree does not mean that income inequality at those levels was required for the standard of living to increase to the same degree, nor that the standards of living wouldn't have increased more if inequality had been lower throughout that period.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:33:04
Why would you ask why income inequality is important and then answer your own question by saying you think it's required for technology to advance?
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:45:02
Was this not factually accurate?
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:42:00
There's no difference.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:05:35
So your goal is to just lower the probability, I guess. There's a lot of reasons your money might be in an exchange for longer than that, even if you're not a day trader.

You could start by reading an overview [here]( Perhaps the sections about the effects of inequality, particularly.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:54:15
So, to be precise, you think extreme wealth inequality is either a good or neutral thing? And you base this on a few examples of rich philanthropists?
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:42:42
It's not an ideal fit as a currency because you want to pay less tax?

Sure, presuming the number of bitcoin transactions increases significantly, which it hasn't over the past year despite all other activity.

Is that chart inflation adjusted?
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:00:33
Well, everyone already says that transaction fees for using bitcoin will be very low in the future, and these will only have to be paid upon transfer of assets. Where will this significant value be created, then?
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:21:29
Why does it need to be raised? This seems to reduce down to “I want to pay less tax” again.

And that $1.8m + mining fees is paying for the processing of only 60-70k transactions a day, or ~$25-$30 a transaction currently.

"which is exceedingly difficult to do unless you do something foolish"
Seems to happen fairly often for something exceedingly difficult to do, and there's no recourse. Everyone paying for it indirectly is a form of risk reduction. A lot of credit card fraud happens because of malware and bitcoin is susceptible to this, also.
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:28:28
Okay, well, this time it has to be a concession.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:03:38
Sure, everyone is paying slightly more in order to reduce their risk. I know that people into Bitcoin are generally pretty inexperienced in financial matters but I think this is probably a simple enough concept to grasp. People that get deeply into debt on their credit cards are the ones really making money for credit card companies, so the same claim of not having to pay for being stupid/foolish applies here too.
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:57:28
I see you're posting elsewhere and not replying. Thanks for conceding the point. You're a true gentleman.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:24:03
Why isn't it stupid to trust your money or bitcoins to them? Did you review the source code for their website and prove it to be sound?

Can you try not to be disgusting in this subreddit? I'm just trying to destroy the government and free myself from taxation slavery to live in a cypherpunk libertarian utopia and I don't need to hear about you masturbating yourself to orgasm to legally obtained pornography.
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:18:34
From where, though. I mean, since bitcoin services have been hacked several times it seems pretty stupid to put your money into any of them.
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:19:57
Would you prefer if all your bitcoins were just irreversibly taken from your account? Seems pretty laughably insecure, or at least pushing the security down the layers to people who have proven not to be able to handle it, generally.
@_date: 2013-05-26 14:14:46
None of this makes any sense and I must presume you have zero mathematical training. Are you a small child or did you drop out of school, perhaps?
Here's what you're defining as a “zoom”, equal scaling of both axes, that shows approximately linear behaviour. 
All scaling the y-axis differently does is change the gradient of the line, which is still approximately linear. Maybe sit down with a pen and paper and work through some examples where you change the aspect ratio and see that it preserves straight lines whilst changing their gradient. And as the x-axis in the example was time, obviously “zooming” in or scaling up the x-axis is looking at short timescales, so I don't know what you think you mean by that, either.
Sorry for presuming you have no mathematical training, that was rude. You could just be incredibly drunk or high while posting instead, which may be impairing your reasoning ability.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:09:31
bitcoin must be completely fucked then
@_date: 2013-05-25 06:10:07
Okay, I did.  oh look, approximately linear.
Thanks for your comment though.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:45:51
Then you contact your credit card company and get those charges reversed. "Everyone else paying for your stupid mistake" is just a form of insurance, are you against all forms of insurance?

Ah, I see you already live in the utopic future where everyone has bitcoins as their primary currency store.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:24:06
That's literally what I said, when you first disagreed with me. What the hell is your point?
edit: I should point out that what you said actually isn't true, but is at least true for differentiable functions for some definitions of “look linear”.
@_date: 2013-05-25 06:13:47
This is a nonsense argument. It will eventually be linear if it saturates those maximums without the limits being raised, but that has nothing to do with the best model of its growth to this point.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:04:30
Do you have car insurance? House insurance? Why do you expect other people to pay for your risk on that? Why do you pay for their risk?
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:45:11
I don't know what you think you're proving by zooming in. All exponential growth looks approximately linear over short enough timescales.
