Does using this one require giving trust to them, do you reckon?

Oh I'm using a Chromebook and cannot run local software easily...needs to be web-based, or I could use my Android tablet I guess but I think something accessable from anywhere is better.

If I delete the app or (better probably?) reinstall the operating system after storing some coins in the app, and just hang on to the passphrase, I guess it's about the same.  In your mind, is there any risk of losing such bitcoins as long as I keep that passphrase?  Any at all?

this what?

  you are a gentleman and a scholar, and i humbly thank you for enlightening me on this topic.   
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:24:05
I see.  Thanks.  So from what you are saying there is no need for paper wallets?

lol...you can go about your business..

Hmmm...can't I just write down my key for a backup?  I surely don't want to trust any third parties, especially one like Coinbase that (even as total noob!) I've already heard questionable things about...  
So if I install Mycelium, generate my key, write it down, put a few Satoshis in there, uninstall it, re-install it, re-enter my key, and see if they are still in there.....right??
(I apologize for my extreme naivete and ignorance here!)

there is no way for the provider to ever steal your coins?  can the passphrase be changed later?  this sounds like it could be ideal...
Just to be sure I have this straight...if I lose my device or it crashes or whatever, can I just reinstall CoPay, enter my passphrase and be all good? 
One more question, please, vdogg89...how hard would it be to turn it all into a paper wallet and just, you know, throw my tablet into some boiling lava or whatever?????  Like if I suspected some kind of malware or someone got my passphrase or some spooks were at the door, kind of thing?
