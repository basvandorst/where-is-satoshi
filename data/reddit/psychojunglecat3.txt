I definitely agree with you. Bitcoin being less of a meme will help people take it more seriously.

Conservatively, you can probably quintuple your investment over the next few years. Or it might crash. You decide if it’s worth it.

Oh no...

Same here. Hope to catch some sub $6000

How about work for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:47:10
How do you know
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:15:54
This entire year? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:14:08
And then buy back in at around $6000 or so?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:45:31
Why so dismissive?

Search around on r/bitcoinbeginners. Unless you maybe have a more specific question? Generally: but BTC on exchange, transfer to hard storage like a TREZOR or Ledger nano, HOLD it for a long time (day trading is something you don’t want to mess with if you are a beginner). Then Cash out if you need to, or better yet keep holding it until BTC is widely adapted.

Widespread government bad might be one of them.

What do you think, even larger pump and dumps? Or something more complicated? Best strategy still to hold?

Thank you. Can you suggest a resource or two where I can learn more about these signals?

The fork was canceled. It’s not happening now. Best/safest strategy is to hold in hard storage.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:07
The fork was just cancelled. hop on an GDAX.com and hang on for the ride!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:42:02
Time to be very patient, right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:24:59
Thanks! Subscribed.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:30:24
Ok, thanks for being upfront. I think I'll go on a run outside instead and keep holding for the long term. This stuff seems incredibly addicting-_-
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:20:17
Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:45:05
Use the search bar

That was pretty lame.
