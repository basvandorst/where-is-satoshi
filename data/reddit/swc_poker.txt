MrHodl approached us and asked if we could host a tournament for bitcoin twitter bragging rights. We agreed to do so at no cost (no rake). Only MrHodl was given the tournament password, so he decides who can take part in the event. Buy in is 0.01 btc, or 10,000 SwC chips. 100% of funds collected will be payed out. Tournament will be no limit hold'em, using our championship structure.   
To sweeten the pot even more, we are holding a freeroll tournament that starts 3 hours before this special event and will award 1 free seat into the exclusive tournament. SwC is paying for this entry.  SwC is a great place for the community to hold special events like this, reach out if you are interested in doing something like this in the future, maybe an r/bitcoin tournament?

Team has been working hard to integrate lightning. We expect our implementation to have many first-time lightning users, so testing will continue until we are satisfied with ui/ux experience, stability and security.

The site existed last year but about 7 weeks ago we relaunched with 100% new software. PC, Mac, Android, and HTML5 clients all working well.

Thank you for your continued support of SwC Poker. The 3.0 platform upgrade was badly needed to push Bitcoin poker mainstream.

Thanks for the support, we are working hard to integrate lightning. We think that SwC deposits and withdrawals could help the network by keeping a big channel open.

Thank you for the nice words. Lightning is a priority, we will roll it out when we are certain of our implementation.

Lightning network functionality is actively being developed. Soon players will have 2 different deposit options, lightning or normal, and 2 different withdrawal options, lightning (no fee) or normal (players pay exact network fee)
