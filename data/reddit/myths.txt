This has been discussed for months. Reasons are coz 1. usually wheb ppl sell off alts, they convert it to btc then convert it to usd/usdt. 2. Bots controls and manipulate the whole market and they have sell orders for everything at the same time to take out certain % of profit

Hi guys, i made a video covering the current FUD over coindesk, tether, bitgrail, facebook banning crypto ads. Feel free to check it out!
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:09:36
what's wrong with LTC though? It's been out as long as bitcoin and is faster with lower transaction fees
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:48:48
i really hope for a big dip in bch and everything else go up
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:52:27
it can be just 2-3 whales. they have that many coins
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:55:03
I also noticed today that at each resistance level, altcoins will gradually drop around 3-5% while btc stays similar level as whales transfer them to btc. Then they will manufacture the dip by without drawing altcoin and just sell btc for cash. But the overall picture will look like btc and alts are having 1:1 correlation 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:17:13
Hi guys, I just registered with Coinbase, verified ID + added my payment method. But it shows that i can not sell coins in my country (Australia).
Can anyone suggest another broker site that's safe to use, can transfer large amount instantly in Australia?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:04
yeah, so everything is manipulative with crypto market, it's a gamble
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:04
u should have seen litecoin last week when there was a 80k coin buywall at $300, turns out to be one single whale fake buy order and he took it out and price dipped to $250 in 10minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:09
whales shaking the market to kill off more smaller players
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:27:06
I was observing btc trend all day and whenever it hits 13700 on my exchange it bounces back to 14200. 5times!!! And just as i put money in, its taking this dip sigh
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:01:29
if u study any stock wave, a updown channel trajectory downwards forming a triangle means it's going to shoot up
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:03:21
what i can see is that all altcoins drop down some % while bitcoin does not move. Then suddenly bitcoin starts dipping. Meaning it's a coordinated event where a group of whales are withdrawing money from all altcoins, transfer to bitcoins then sell for USD. It's not people withdraw some coins cashing out for Xmas. It won't have this much an impact on the market
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:47:41
I have patiance to play with them. And its only 3:50pm here. Wont head for be for another 12hours
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:32:34
The bots are more clever today. Creates some fake resistance every $1000 drop or so, more ppl will buy in each resistance level then more money will be eaten up with the big dip later today
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:48:35
here comes the next one..
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:30:50
here comes the whale manipulation again

money laudering
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:40:24
it doesn't support australia either
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:14:11
yeah, i just verified there, but the daily limit is only $2000, and Bpay takes 1-2 days just to deposit money into the exchange, then fulfilling of your buying order probably gonna take a while also. Man, living in Australia sux. Btw Coinbase has a $500 daily limit as well, how do people trades Millions of $ at once?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:39:03
i think big drop coming as well, btc graph is forming an upwards triangle. I think one more big drop to around $10000 then we will take off
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:23:52
It has actually been at 24999aud on the australian exchange btc msrket for a day now. But there are just too many sell orders at 25000 for it to go up
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:19
don't look the depth chart, the buy wall and sell wall there is just to give u false insurance. Most of them are bots
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:08:19
u can use btc market or coinspot if u live in Aus like me. BTC Market has $4k daily limit after u verify
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:14:35
Thx for the info. Im not looking to buy bitcoins. But a mix of litecoin, ripple ans other currencies, which of the 2 wallet would u recommend? Trezor is a bit more expensive is it better?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:01:06
Basically i'm looking to put $200,000 into bitcoin now, people say to go to buybitcoinworldwide.com. But which country should i look for? And say if they grow into $250,000 in a few months and i want to transfer back to my bank account. Is it easy to do and what are the charges?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:30:48
Hi guys, if i want to buy a large amount of bitcoin from Coinbase. Say $150,000. Is it ok for me to keep the bitcoin in Coinbase wallet? Or should i find a different E wallet? If so, which E wallet is the most secure?

alright, will do cheers

Bitcoin Technical Analysis 03/03/18 - Higher target in sight!
Bitcoin is closing consecutive daily candles above the long term resistance line and is looking increasingly bullish! I explained in this video how to establish our next targets. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:57:03
Bitcoin Technical Analysis 02/03/2018 - Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin
Bitcoin has finally closed a daily candle above the long term downtrend line. If we starting to close candles above the $11200 mark, that signals we are on wave 2 out of a new 3 wave impulse. Next target would be around $12200-$13000.
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:07:09
In this video, i go through the next possible buy zone of Bitcoin and why is Technical Analysis not just random numbers.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:45:55
Thats where TA comes in handy. You can not predict the tops and bottoms, but you can see trend reversals. You sell at residtance and you either buy a breakout or you ladder your buys at historical supports and Fibonacci levels. 4am here, goodnight. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:28:19
thank you, i'll try upload frequently
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:44:20
i was saying you should sold at $11000 few days ago as i mentioned in my video that we will see a retracement. 
It makes sense for you to sell at $10950-11000 to secure profit/minimise loss depends where you bought your BTC. It has nothing to do with you couldn't buy at 9200.
$8200 is the .618 Fibonnaci level and $8900 is the .5 Fibonnaci level. I don't want to type a long paragraph on those levels but you can google it. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:32:06
Bitcoin saw huge buying volume kicking in past 12hours for BTC despite Tether stopped printing. That is a very good sign. If we can break through the triple resistance level in the next day or so. We can see BTC go on a very bullish run!
Here is my analysis:
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:33:46
i might be very wrong, but it's just my opinion from observation of the market and buying volumes recently
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:13:51
i understand a lot of people think it's just drawing lines. The reason why i believe this is because big players, hedge funds, banks, etc use these indicators to enter long and short positions. It's like in general when people talking about crypto is full of bots, a lot of these bots run algorithms with these indicators to trigger buy and sell conditions. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:24:05
ok, so someone buys 1 btc at $17000, if he rides it all the way down to $6000, that's a loss of $11000. Instead, he sees the possibility of this big retracement and sell at $15000 to take a $2000loss. He is now smart and starts to cost average his buyins. He buys back 0.5btc at $10000, buys back another 0.5btc at $8000 and buys 1btc at $6000. Now he sells all at $11000, by taking the $2000 loss initially, guess what, he just sold everything for $22000, a $5000 profit instead of a $12000 loss. By reducing your losses smartly when you see a big resistance level and swing trade your way up, you will make profit.

Bitcoin is possibily forming an inverse head and shoulder with an upside around $17600 if we can close above $11800 with a few consecutive candles, feel free to watch my analysis:
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:27:12
ummm..reducing loss in a way is making profit no? Since this gives u the option to buy back in at a lower price and make another leg of profit/reduce another round of loss? This is what swing traders like me do, we swing between the tops and bottoms on a regular basis. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:46:34
i wouldnt go in detail of the % return but if u watched my video, i mentioned that i wouldn't get into any long term position till we see a big market rally. Trading positions are small now, i add more into it everytime we break a resistance level, but i need to see multiple candles close above the resistance for me to do that. I have pretty much only been swing trading BTC since i think 3rd week of Jan. That made me missed out on the massive alt rally on the 6th. But i have been gaining steadily. So it's working out good for me so far. I guess another reason it's working out better for me compare to others is that i do this full time and i gotta take profit out when i see them instead riding it long in the bear market. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:00:03
i dont think they are just pumps. It's showing big money are confident about the 9200 resistance level. If we can break above the longterm downtrend line in 12hours time, we might be able to form an inverse head and shoulder formation, feel free to watch my next analysis:

Yes, no one can answer those questions but if you really want certain answers. Few videos ago when BTC was still around $11000, i said that we are in a retracement and we are going down towards $8900, we didnt quite hit that mark but i guess u can take that moment as a definite sell moment. that would be $1900 profit per BTC as we hit $9200. Also if you want certainty then i would say to sell now at $10950-$11000, reason for that is that meets our downtrend line. You secure your profit if you buy at $9200, this gives you $3800 profit per btc with this 2 trades. Now it comes to our condition of if btc can break the down trend line. If no, then i would ladder my buys between $8200-$8900. If yes, i would buy a break out above $12000-$12200. These would be certainty. What Technical analysis does is it gives you these trade options, you can't always think to ride one wave up or down. Of course if you are a hodler, you don't have to worry about TA at all.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:42:26
everyone should be holding alt and btc. If you putting all your eggs into a single crypto currency then you are playing the game wrong. I have 40% my portfolio in BTC in general but i liquidate some of them when i see a retracement coming. I'm not giving out buy signals in my video and twitter, i'm just doing TA on them and people can make their own decision. I'm transparent and said i bought into Icon in this video and i did not anywhere asked people to buy into it in the video.

My Technical Analysis on BTC in the short term
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:34:58
yeah, with 100subscribers i can pump a coin. I'm just trying to distribute some knowledge and here to make money. BTC is on its bigger wave 2 retracement right now and some other coins have completed or nearly completed that retracement. i still hold a large possession in btc myself btc
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:36:59
Bitcoin touched around the 50, 100day EMA and 0.236 Fib level yesterday and broke down. Here is my short term analyse on BTC today:
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:11:53
we dont need to look too far at 11800 yet, if we dont close above 10900-11000, which is the long term downtrend line. We will see another leg down and i believe the support will be around $8200-$8900. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:54:37
i bet you haven't watched my video on tron, i did not shill tron at all. I went through their upcoming events and said Justin should focus on technology instead shilling his coins. Please comment after you know what you are talking about
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:17:11
that means u reduced ur loss by $3600. It's like i'm looking at this 4hour candle stick right now, it's closing in 45minute. If it closes below 10750-10800. This gives me an indication to sell again and buy back lower.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:07:12
like what i said, $11000 is not just a random number, it's a number institutions look at through TA analysing. I sold at 10959, and now i can pick it up for cheaper again.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:37:12
thanks for the comment, i was just giving some word of cautious because a lot of ppl telling others bottom is in. Gotta be careful trading at times like this
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:58:32
i explained that if you sell at $11000 when i said there's a retracement and buy back at $9200, u make $1800. Now i'm saying to sell before the resistance before $11000 again, u would make another $1800 roughly. That's 3600, sorry not 3800, it's 2am here. 
Fib level has their meaning because these are the levels big traders, hedge funds, banks, whatever look at as buying levels. Usually .5 and .618 is the 2nd wave retracement level. All these trading bots people talk about in crypto, they use indicators to calculate buy and sell prices. They run algorithms, they don't just think buy low sell high, they want solid levels. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:24:30
i feel we haven't seen the bottom yet, i made a video on it:
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:47:56

i have just started to upload my TA 3days ago, so let's see, time shall tell
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:28:47
right now just watching, i sold at 10400 after seeing it's not breaking through the 0.236Fib level
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:57:49
what i'm saying is that we shouldn't panic sell BTC into USD right now. There are opportunities out there to make money, ICX in my opinion is one of them. I also pointed out that once BTC hit the support around .5 to .618 Fib level, we should see a bigger bounce up for a start of a wave 3
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:29:08
thank you, 1hour and 4hour chart looking good short term right now, see where the current candle on 4hour chart close at in 30minutes. Might see a small bullish run today
