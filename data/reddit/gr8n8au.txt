perhaps people who move alot of coins can open a large channel with someone and move large amounts around quickly with lighting?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:10:07
My understanding is that this has been done already.
It might sound somewhat unbelievable but I've read at least two post of people claiming they have done it.
I remember one post mentioned it was done with CBA bank in Australia.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:17:12
once i manually rebroadcast a transaction to successfully double spend a transaction that was pending for i believe 6 days it to save a significant amount of bitcoin (if i hadn't underpaid the fee which made this transaction go through the bitcoin was gone forever, so lucky in retrospect). I remember ll the major miners wouldn't include it in a block and many of the service i used to manually broadcast the transaction also wouldn't allow it - took my days to work out how to do it but i did, there's a post in my history somewhere about how i did it. I was pretty proud to see a big red box message on blockchain.info saying 'attempted double spend' and then later to have the transaction validate, it was included in a block by an unknown miner.
i believe the replace by fee function (or parent pays for child?) should work if you used a wallet than enables that or broadcasts that type of transaction, in my case i hadn't

It might not be luck that i decided to invest in bitcoin but  i feel lucky (people say people who got in early are lucky?) i stumbled across an article about it in 2013 - i immediately reconized the potential and invest and i still feel that i wish i had heard about it sooner.
I guess Torleik below had the  answer that caused me to find out about bitcoin.  "Read more articles about literally everything?"
I was doing alot of reading at that point of my life. I guess the next step would be do choose good sources to read from.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:44:56
It makes sens someone has pulled it off - it's an asset that can be sold for an amount of dollars and you can prove you have it. I believe using BTC for this purpose in the future will become common place.
Not for a mortgage but there is a real estate agent in my city that has been accepting bitcoin since 2014:
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:40:47
yeah and that rich list has wallets for exchanges that hold coins for thousands of people
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:41:43
have you looked into if this could possibly be recoverable by professionals depending on how corrupted the data is? somehow maybe there's a small chance private keys could still be recovered?

well i don't consider myself an expert (and also not sure this is basic economics which i thought i might know) so could understand if my understanding was wrong but i'm here for discussion and if my understanding is wrong so the same may be other people so not to argue but to elaborate
fractional banking would probably exist if banks operated on bitcoin, dam banks it's just the nature of it/them but i still would consider bitcoin  a tool for  to help reduce fractional banking?
i really don't understand why the fees of a bank would be higher to have proof of reserves? i didn't believe providing proof of reserves would expensive compared to what i thought would be huge savings by not having to have as many accountants (through use of blockchain) and not having to use clearing houses?  or once again use multisig accounts?
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:14:38
a button you could press to  reveal the price would be good - that way its not in your face but people could check it
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:56:36
use local bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:59:16
but you could choose to use a bitcoin bank with proof of reserves - or i believe there's multisig bitcoin banks in the works.. and lower fees with your bitcoin bank - bitcoin bank is better than non bitcoin bank and if your happy managing your own security you can remain you own bank
also if bitcoin were widely adopted(with proof or reserves and other transparent functions)so much money wouldn't be constantly created out of nowhere by the banks to be loaned out at levels that can't be paid back
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:02:08

no not anymore bitcoin cant handle to much growth yet?
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:26:58
$273 increase a day isn't so much if the price is at $50,000
@_date: 2015-06-26 23:41:03
so now you can force yourself to lock your bitcoin for the future so you know you wont spend or cash them?
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:17:16
i'm sure if we were still at 7200 coins per the price would be lower
and the price has stayed higher than before the last halving
i think we will see a similar story after next halfing
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:54:58
such honesty
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:33:00
right good point that i hadn't considered they won't be able to loan as much with fractional banking (which is really obvious). maybe i'm being optimistic for the banks (or bitcoin or should that be the other way around)but maybe bitcoin could chip away at the banks billions in profits by less people need them with more infrastructure and adoption rather than them maintaining their profits in other ways 
or perhaps the innovative banks can make more cost effective lower margin products using bitcoin technology which can help them maintain lower fees and profits

blackcoin is looking good it's coming 3rd in volume at the moment after bitcoin and litecoin

there's no mining and at the moment this means less than $200 worth of coins hitting the market daily - you can pretty much only get them by buying them
there's also an awesome multipool which is worth understanding

@_date: 2014-11-24 06:35:32
that's what i thought, thanks - i'd be much happier if the companies i was paying the bills to accepted BTC directly 
also i think coinjar offers this same service for free (if anyone can confirm)?

i googled bitcoin faucet you should  do that 
the first result was this:

you get credited the fill amount you deposit on all poker sites i know off including fulltilt and pokerstars but there would be a saving to the poker operators
also having bitcoin option available on bitcoin would mean people could get hopefully instant withdrawals - the withdrawal process is what sucks most about online poker 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:39:55
my understanding and memory of the image is that someone posted it on Reddit once and then someone else came up with idea to crowd fund paying for Reddit adds with it - you will notice this message on the bottom right of sidebar
Ad campaign:
We previously collected donations to fund Bitcoin advertising efforts, but we no longer accept donations. The funds already donated will be spent on some sort of advertising, as intended. (2.878 BTC spent so far.)

love it. 
"peaceful revolution" is such a great line/title 
and its such a chilled out song
just needs a bitcoin address somewhere 
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:29:28
my understanding is that you could always send no fee transaction fees just be prepared to potentially wait longer.
something to do with miners who  which exclude transactions without fees but there are still some miners willing to include them - or something like that 
i know the first time i did it i got worried when transaction didnt appear on blockchain - 24 hours later it started confirmed

bitcoinclock.com says

does anyone know how accurate that is? or if there is somewhere more accurate?
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:35:56
something like "donate to keep artwork here instead of advertisement"

not sure where crowdfunded BTC would be best spent but there must be some marketing experts amongst us

Anyone think it could go 8 fold again?
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:48:16
but i didn't buy it for investment reasons - as someone who bought my first bitcoin for $60 at the time never expected it to increase so much - just liked the principles behind bitcoin so bought some to spend and support it

coinjar if you are in Aus
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:52:11
ouch that must really hurt - try and find evidence of the transaction and prove they own delivery - the amount of money that is at stake since the value increase so much i think you would likely require legal action
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:39:55
so i need to say my bitcoins are for personal use starting as a interest and hobby into crypto  (not investment) to avoid capital gains tax?

really? i'd like to know more, someone owning a mobile phone creating a rental business from that phone is amazing. 
i wish there was a  charity PO box address that donated phones can be sent to give away to people in such villages in India..
instead here in Australia we have these stupid recycling stations that recycle many WORKING mobile phones for the raw materials they contain or they  collect or resell them.. it's all under the guise of being good for the planent but it's such a waste imo when you hear stories like this where a phone is so valued it can create an income!? .These are the people that need the phones the most.
@_date: 2015-05-11 10:03:10
perhaps they will design the devices to only operate if connected to a wi-fi / internet connection

Satoshi's 21st last message was also:
21	  Bitcoin / Project Development / Re: Wikileaks contact info?	 on: December 05, 2010, 09:08:08 AM
Quote from: RHorning on December 04, 2010, 10:17:44 PM
Basically, bring it on.  Let's encourage Wikileaks to use Bitcoins and I'm willing to face any risk or fallout from that act.
Satoshi's response to above:
'No, don't "bring it on".
The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.
I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy.  You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.'

cheap notebook is good

Ive got a feeling alot of the data could be there but probably needs the best ant most very expensive recovery service. Best bet could be holding onto it for years and waiting for the price to rise.

people who think their safe right now with large sums or money and wont realise until they need to recover?
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:56:51
yep true, just a positive for altruistic/hobby miners 
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:19:58
so we should imagine solar panels coming with inbuilt miner?
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:05:37
but less USD transactions than before bitcoin was around
it's understandable that the majority of transactions are done in USD as there is a technology barrier in accessing the darkweb and a fear of being caught if you dont use the technology correctly
for the average drug users it was feels safer, easier and more convenient (even if that's not the case) to buy illegal things with cash
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:04:42
so was this malicious? the post title "trying to fork the network" insinuates that it was

this was a heroic act, a bitcoin hero to me.
using the feral reserve servers to mine bitcoin - amazing - Nicholas is probably proud to have accomplished this.
Would love to hear from him.
I wonder if this made acted as a catalyst for anyone at the Fed look into bitcoin further?
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:06:44
you've probaly already thought about this but i would literally try and hunt it down - i d say you have at least a 1% chance of getting that computer back if u try
someone probably still has the P and has no idea.. maybe some posters is the likely places it got distributed and sold - i know long shot but you never know - big payout if you found it
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:12:13
the numbers look inaccurate to me
if one transaction can power 3.67 america households for a day why is the fee for the transaction only a few cents?
im sure it costs more than a few cents to power that many homes for a day 
otherwise this would mean miners are running at a huge loss
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:34:09
its to painful 2 share

i wonder if there are people out there that have been or will be screwed by this
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:35:24
how much exposure will this provide to bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-30 13:00:51
a new high isn't always variance
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:06:23
if ppl held what was mined at a loss from years ago -  i doubt its no longer mined at a loss
mining at a loss could turn profitable if your holding long term
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:45:31
you haven't lost anything - you can fix this
but yeah this is frustrating for new users
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:23:20
for free bonuses you have to have bet a certain amount before it can be withdrawn i think its 40x the amount of the bonus with them
if you click on the bonus tab it will tell you the percentage you have completed
let me know if you still feel you have been scammed as i wont play there if that is the case
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:38:28
so this tells me how much to pay per byte
so now how do you know how many bytes your transaction will be?
isn't there a simpler way to present how much fee i should pay?
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:49:39
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:28:03
yeah any chance  them broadcasting 1500 transaction each second be responsible for the increase in the transaction backlog?
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:47:45
such a shit idea
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:02:01
yep once you have cleared the wagering requirement you can withdraw the full/any amount, i personally forfeit the bonuses when depositing because sometimes i have a win but cant withdraw because of wagering requirement and although i get to keep the bonus once i've completed the wagering requirement i've often lost my winnings by that point
i think perhaps the bonuses work in the casinos favour for players with smaller bankrolls
and did you find them by googling best online bitcoin casinos or something or that nature like me?
@_date: 2016-11-22 09:00:55
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:22:58
really i played there with no issues - why wouldn't it let you cash out? did you click on bonus page and see if you had met bonus wagering requirement?
@_date: 2016-12-08 07:06:12
alot of these addresses could be bitcoin service companies
or maybe a big exchange which has broken it's balance down to multiple cold wallets
meaning some of these addresses could be very well distributed
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:15:32
hah same
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:28:41
it was working until the price dropped.
With BTC @ &gt; $1000 using mBTC makes sense
$1 per mBTC
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:37:12
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:27:04
um sounds scary
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:47:18
same thing is true for Australian Dollars
@_date: 2016-12-14 08:38:31
such a under rated major bitcoin use case - this will get big
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:07:50
copy pasted from the paper:
Aj &gt; (1 + )2−κ
= PrhX
Aj &gt; t + 2−κ
≤ PrhX
Aj &gt; t +
E[Aj |E(J)
≤ PrhX
(Aj − E[Aj |E(J)
]) &gt; t] ≤ exp n
2v + 2bt/3
≤ exp n
(6 + 2)
some crazy stuff
what does it all mean?? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:49:24
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:47:08
yeah seems like the majority of the user base wants it to happy already - who is holding it up at this stage?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:24
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:08:15
somehow i think the stuff you don't like (which might keep some people away) keeps others coming back
like the bitcoin wizard - some love all he represents some treat him as amateur hour.
bring back the wizard.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:39:12
correct - your doing well
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:03:34
yeah it's possible - i would want just 1 confirmation so i'd  just make them make sure a decent fee is included
@_date: 2015-08-29 00:17:22
or igot your money hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:13:35
we used to fight over if the wizard was a good or bad thing in attracting people here..
i find it interesting how something small like different personality types means some people came here because of the wizard (some who did very well from bitcoin because of the wizard alone) whilst others like you were put of by it.
in some weird way being more childish about money in terms of being attracted to strange new internet money that had a mascot drawn in paint (and maybe liking magic) could have served someone here well

i think the seller could rebroadcast the transaction to a different address with a higher fee and make the one with no fee void - but it seems that hasn't happened yet so don't think you got scammed other than the $12 which was probably just a typo
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:32:01
Nice I read somewhere on reddit over a year ago someone tried this - they put forward a lot and it got knocked back because of something stupid

does anyone know if this group will actually be buying bitcoins? i read somewhere they can calculate it all in USD then i also read somewhere else his isn't possible because of how volatile bitcoin can be.

he's been pretty active &amp; i believe he will probably reply to this thread,  he said he will 'do something' it it does happen

very well said - i'm sure many of us have an odd special kinda love for the wizard and all that he represents as a mascot for BTC. This reminds me that i really want one of those coffee mugs with the wizard on it.

awesome idea
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:50:45
 I did read the contract spec and noticed it said cash settled but don't have a good understanding of future and so asked on reddit when i came across this thread. i ask because many people have been saying (even in the responses to this post) that this will likely mean they will need some exposure to bitcoin and want to know if this is true. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:32:41
how did you rationalize doing that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:46:32

I guess it feels like a loan is to much risk for a strong belief
Really if we could feel extremely confident bitcoin will even just double we would all be taking loans
Would be curious to know about anyone having the courage to take loans for bitcoin - i know some have done it and for those that held (which i believe is most who would take a loan) it has done well for them so far.

good point also that I didn't consider so now decided to go and google it and get the answer "what percentage of Australians are millionaires"
according to Credit Suisse Australia has 1.16 millionaires = so that's 4%+ of the population are millionaires and that including &lt; 18 year olds
also just googles top countries by percentage of millionaires.. and Singapore is at 15% population having millionaire status -holy

but couldn't they make more money by attracting people who want to spend bitcoin? isn't this the whole idea of this move in the first place - to enable more payment options? otherwise they would just keep it the way it is - seeing they own papal

thanks ! much appreciated! 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:51:45
nice post thanks for detailing that concept, makes sense
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:40:17
I believe in Australia this would be the case and therefore in America it would be thee same  too, reasoning:
Their are about 24million people in Australia
There is about 5 million in Sydney alone
The average price of a home in Sydney is $1mil.
roughly 45% of people in the country and 1/3 of homeowners own their house outright with no mortgage 
That's 1 in every 6.7 Australians roughly that own their own house with no mortgage.
So one in every 6.7 of the 5 million people in Sydney are on average millionaires, that's 746,268 millionaires in Sydney alone,- - and this is just Sydney and only looking at property.
So only taking into account the Sydney people that 746,268 people out of our 26 million population is already a minimum of 2.87% of our citizens are millionaires, but the number would be way higher when you takes into account the number 21 million people.
Dam that's a lot of millionaires, makes me think my maths is wrong somewhere but now I'm thinking 10%+ of Australians are millionaires and that's 2.6millionares in Australia alone. If we are 10% in my mind America would have to 1%+. I now wonder why didn't I just google how many millionairess in Australia/America, oh well still not going to, nice to think for yourself, I'm happy with my answer.
We have one of the most inflated property markets in the world, we are a real estate nation primarily, if our property market crashes our number of millionaires will  significantly decline.

So i looked at coinmap and found a Thai Restaurant called Green PepperCorn
they are in at 1 Hamilton Road ,  Fairfield 
here is their website:
here is their menu:
The 1st item on the list is deep fried chicken wings!
I think you should go and eat there now. Would also recommend ringing 1st to double check coinmap is accurate and let us know how you go if you do. (i might try them myself)
