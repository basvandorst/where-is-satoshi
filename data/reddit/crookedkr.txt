If it's not anonymous what would anyone want to use it over ebay or amazon?

The password store is really nice. You can keep one for coins and one for passwords.

I would do a few small transactions on localcoins and ask around. you can probably find a private seller that has many coins. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:08:32
It would be interesting to try to get an analysis of just how many "live" coins there are. It would be pretty easy to find any coins sent to invalid addresses, but an estimate on lost keys would be harder.

it's the government saving you from youself. The idea is that if you have $2M in investable assets, or $300k /yr income you can afford to lose money on unsecured (or less regulated) investments. They don't want people getting convinced to put their life savings of $100k into something that will probably bust and have no way to recover the losses.

I mean people lose their private keys. I lost some, for instance, but reformatting my phone. Those coins are never coming back. Likewise, there are plenty of stories of people formatting or losing hard drives with private keys. The longer old coins stay put, the higher the chances they are lost. One could probably come up with the distribution to make estimates on what percent of some address should be considered dead.
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:14:03
So these are provably dead coins right?

Seems like it's not just NY. I get the please...org site and i'm not in NY. Though it just seems to be the main page that gets redirected, i can see the other pages if i go directly.

As a start maybe someone can independantly try to get the code and keys and try to reproduce/refute my results.
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:50:02
these are less secure than a trezor right?

i saw him at the MIT event. His talk included a few references to how little he had prepared and he fired through some weak slides and gave a pretty uninspired talk. Since you all seem to really like him, which videos should i watch?

Yeah I have used liberty in Boston a few times but the % take seems too high. I think I'll go back to good old localcoins.

What is the best way to buy coins? I'm generally between liberty teller and localbitcoin but i can't find liberty's fees (or exchange rate, same thing) anywhere...

Why does everyone love apple so much. They stifle innovation until it hurts their bottom line and the have people line up to pay multiple times the market rate for an apple branded version of several year old technology. How about since btc is getting traction we ban apple instead of the other way around.

oh i guess they could be like visa gift cards, but i was thinking they were self made gift cards only useful in the business itself. if this is the case it's totally trackable (if OP bothered to do it). In which case there is more proof of who used them.
@_date: 2014-09-17 10:45:32
How are prepaid cards different than regular merchandise?
Void the gift cards?

How does this matter exactly? If a new york law said you can't sell toilet paper to any NY resident without a license and a NYer comes to my business in YN and buys toilet paper maybe i'm in breach but so what, NY doesn't make the rules for YN. If you aren't "doing business" in NY why does it matter? Someone should reach out to Delaware...i bet they would be happy to get BC businesses going...

The link to AMD hardware shows that companies are accepting bitcoin before they really understand it. Overstock [did the same]( None the less it's nice to see another large online retailer start accepting bitcoin.

Except that you could give one to alice and one to Bob. If either is stopped at the boarder you haven't lost anything.

chart says excluding "common" addresses. so i would guess gambling removed.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:07:54
yeah the pattern is intersting and i would definitely be interested in guesses as to why it does that.

We'd have to see the contract to know if they can drop GAW, but I'd be surprised if they could especially at this late a date.

Yeah but how often is your trezor out of you control vs how often the exchange is out of your control; very different attack surfaces.

are you honoring the 2 hours or no? The tweet seems to say no.

Not the whole wallet just the coins that went to the same public key. Let's say there is 1 evo coin at address 17. If that coin is transfered to address 37, and then address 100 sends 3 coins to address 37, all 4 coins are indistinguishable. But address 44 could be in the same wallet and has nothing to do with address 37. In fact the only way to link addresses 37 and 44 is if they were both inputs to the same transaction. Since you need the private keys of both 37 and 44 it's generally assumed that both belong to the same user.

Where is the big bulky "can't pick this up and walk out of the store" thing they have in delis. If I'm going to exchange btc in my office I can do it with my phone and save $750. Maybe cool for a deli though if you can find a good bulky case.
