Why the hell is 15% just labeled "other" when those smaller ones are numerous and correctly labeled? something to hide?

Well i just checked out all your links and none of them say anything about Bitcoin Cash and the negative implications of blocksize scaling. Just FUD about Roger Ver. One of them was even created by you. 
All you have to do is read the whitepaper and its clear where BTC has strayed from what was initially envisioned. Once BTC adopted segwit and other "off-chain" centralization loopholes like those it became solely a money grab. Bitcoin cash scales the blocks as needed and it has an average tx fee of $.04, it doesnt have to let someone else invent some workaround that then can be scaled. Bitcoin cash is about being a usable adoptable miniscule fee p2p cash system, is that not what Bitcoin was supposed to be?? when did it change? If btc were 100k, could you imagine the cost of sending $20 p2p? that makes it unusable for anyone who doesnt have extreme wealth. why should anyone have to pay $30 for their transaction to be confirmed within 24 hours. Satoshi is rolling in his grave.

you calling it "bcash" shows you had no good intention in the first place. go to new jersey and ask the locals why they live in "NewJ" and refuse to call it by its actual name, you will find some people take offence

the word "scam" should not be used lightly. bch is no different than any other alt-coin. a cancer on the crypto community? where is the basis for that? because it says bitcoin in the name? no its because its poised to dominate a large portion of btc's marketshare due to its adoption-friendly lower transaction fees. could you imagine if mcdonalds started calling In-n-out burger a "scam and cancer"? it wouldnt make any sense other than being an attack on its competitor. there has been a huge misinformation campaign and everyone who says "bcash scamcoin" has been socially conditioned to believe that. if it were true, there'd probably a more diverse set of attacks, but no its just Trumpian presumption and overconfidence. Open your mind

hostile? you mean non-bitcoin-preferential. its like the only crypto that can ever be successful without resorting to "hostile" tactics is bitcoin, the only crypto thats not a fraud is bitcoin, the only crypto that should be legal is bitcoin. ideas like that make anyone associated with bitcoin lose credibility.

You talk like someone who doesn't really understand. I've been upfront with you and the whitepaper has more influence on Bitcoin cash than Bitcoin without a doubt. You haven't said anything at all just provided some opinions of other people that you carry around, while scoffing at the whitepaper. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash could exist harmoniously, and Bitcoin cash isn't the cause of the strife.

You can hate on lightning and not hate on bitcoin. I just showed you how it does not scale, the user has to scale their payments. What happens when you want to send not just a micro transaction? No one outside of this community has to use such a complex mechanism to send their cryptocurrency, regardless of how big or small it is. You should be questioning why Bitcoin needs the complex mechanism because it doesnt need it. The complex mechanism is not the bug it is the feature to those who want to undermine the decentralized and trust-free nature of Bitcoin and make it slow and unusable for the majority of people.

Then youre scaling your transactions, because the network itself can't scale on its own.

A full mempool is like a wallet full of money but the wallet is to small to get the money out. Why not make the wallet bigger? If the mempool is like a wallet, lightning is like an even smaller wallet but you only use it for change. Its all silly just do it all on-chain. Off-chain means "off bitcoin" no matter how much they say its gonna be the same.

Bitcoin is the chain so scaling on-chain is what would actually make it successful.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:06:15
No thats not scaling. Allowing the chain to get super congested and forcing people to use an alternative (lightning) system to make it feasible is not scaling.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:40:42
If that's what you think, why not just make btc completely off-chain? If everything were off chain, this guy easily could get his money back.

Segwit is undermining decentralization, lightning is undermining decentralization. If you have something that works off chain and is a 2nd layer, that thing itself is centralized, and that makes the chain centralized too because the 1st layer talking to the 2nd layer means that the 1st layer becomes a byproduct of the 2nd layer. Its not backwards man these "solutions" that theyve been implementing since segwit make the chain MORE reliant on a 3rd party. Because now that the 3rd party is there, you cant feasibly use bitcoin without them. Thats why now you cant send p2p transactions on-chain without huge fees. On BCH the avg fee for the past 5 months has been $0.08. Thats on chain, p2p, and isnt only for micropayments. Ltc tx fee is a bit more but still way less. Doge is very low as well. I know Bitcoin is supposed to be a store of value, but IMO the value of any coin is how efficiently and cheaply it can MOVE value. Which makes Bitcoin not very valuable at all

wow that's super interesting.

I've been in bitcoin for 7 years and the past 4 years have come and go without it producing even one substantive innovation. If you've really been in bitcoin for more than 6 years you'd know how cheap transaction fees were back 2012-2015, and they're not now. Thats not the kind of innovation I admire.
