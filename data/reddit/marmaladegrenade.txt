That still doesn't explain anything though - why would I only earn 2 coins when the calculator shows you'll earn a lot more?

Could you explain why though? If I have the money to buy the hardware, wouldn't it be more profitable to get it and start mining?

I guess I'm just confused why it would be better to buy/trade coins instead of mining. I'm not talking about mining using cheap equipment with 30Mh/s but with with 600GH/s or the 3TH/s stuff.

So fast that 3 TH/s wouldn't get much?

Yes - are they not reputable?
Ah, just read up a bit on some of the issues they're having with people. Scrap purchasing through them.
Would you happen to be able to recommend something else?

Understandable - I'm aware of the changes in requirements to mine, but considering I have the ability to purchase something like the Hashblaster "I" or the Xtreme Miners Tiger, it would only seem logical to purchase one of those units and start mining. Using the calculator, I'd be netting a decent profit just from mining.
So skipping out entirely on BFL, if one of the other ASICs become available sooner, wouldn't it be worth it then to buy one and start mining?

I don't think I'm understanding then. Based on the calculators and multiplying the difficulty by 10, wouldn't I still be making a hefty profit for a little while before the difficulty got too high?
