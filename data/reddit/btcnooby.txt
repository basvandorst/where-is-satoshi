  Is Bitcoin really a "competitor" or will Bitcoin be viewed as a digital gold?  Gold exists as a metal now and lives harmoniously with a printed dollar.  I don't see how Bitcoin versus Fedcoin would be any different than the current relationship between the physical dollar and precious metals.   The properties of Bitcoin, (capped supply etc..) are completely different than they way in which Fed coin would operated, assuming that the Fed models the digital dollar with the same properties of the physical dollar.
I guess the Fed would be pissed if nobody used the digital dollar and everyone used Bitcoin as a currency.  I doubt that will happen.  I think Bitcoin will be a long-term store or value just like precious metals.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

I had a similar experience but outside the BTC space.  In my late twenties I started a company in a niche market with a clear expiration date on the length of the market.  I was on top of the world while the dough was rolling in, thinking that it would never end.  I was doing a bunch of blow, ordering johnny blues every night out at the club, etc..  Until one day the music stopped playing and I was stuck without a chair to sit in.  My niche business dried up and I was fucked financially.  It was a depressing time.  However,  I really needed to learn that lesson in my late twenties so that I could make wiser decisions in the future.  Luckily, I started a new business making very good money again and am so much wiser now at 34 than before.  
That being said,  I am down about 30k in btc.   I first bought at 80 and 200 before the Nov bubble.  I am down the 30k because I bought a bunch in april/june thinking that 450 was the floor.  
Either way, you're still young and you should be thankful for the lesson learned.

I doubt China will pull the plug on Bitcoin.  The Chinese have so much skin in the game.  The government knows if BTC gains serious traction that many Chinese citizens will be incredibly wealthy and powerful.

If they were going to pull the plug, they would have already done so.

Ahh, yes, the stupid index fund argument about why Trump sucks at business.  You do realize what you are arguing completely disproves your point? So instead of Trump putting his money into an index fund hoping for an increase in value over 35 years, he decides to get in the trenches and build a worldwide multi billion dollar real estate portfolio the old fashioned way.    That doesn't happen by accident.   It's comical that you think it's so easy just to build things and make profits.  Simply throw someone a huge credit line, and all of a sudden you're a Billionaire.  Your arguments are weak and quoting some clown reporter who started peddling this BS to undermine what Trump has accomplished in the business sector is beyond embarrassing.

According to BusinessWeek, the Trump Organization brought in about $605 million in revenue last year, and managed to clear somewhere between $275 and $325 million in profit. That’s a phenomenally high profit margin (which, of course, is a key sign of the health of a business). Trump’s approximately 50 percent margin means his company is more profitable than Pfizer, Gazprom, and Hyundai – all the most profitable companies in their respective industries. Trump’s company even has higher margins than Apple. Who knew? It turns out Steve Jobs was only “fair-to-middling” at running a business.

If they have dual citizenship, then no it is not.  They can return to their homelands.  But it would be immoral to strip those of citizenship who only have citizenship in England.    Either way, ethnic nationalism does not mean racism.  It just means preservation of their own culture, traditions, and people from being overrun by non-natives who do not want to assimilate.

Ethnic nationalism is not racism.   Is China racist for wanting to preserve their ethnic heritage?  What about countries in the middle east?  Is Israel racist?   There is nothing wrong with English folks wanting to preserve their culture and remain a white country.  This logic is so absurd.  Europe is the homeland for whites.   Asia is for Asians, etc..... 
The white population is a global minority on the planet.  Only 8% of the entire world is white.   Do you really blame some Europeans for being outraged for being forced to "accept" non-white migrants who refuse to assimilate?  Ask yourself this, would the Chinese citizens be pissed if millions of migrants were being sent to China and setting up little baghdad's and mogadishus everywhere in major Chinese cities?  Yes, they would protest it.   Would they protest it in Mexico? Yep, they would.  
The logic for migrants being imported is that the white birth rate is down and they will help the economy.  There is no discussion about getting the white birthrates up, only mass importation into Europe.  What I find interesting is that only white nations are being forced to take all of the muslim migrants.   Unfortunately, I have a feeling war will ultimately break out in Europe in the future.  Scary times.

2.  This will be a problem only for a brief period.  If mainstream adoptions starts happening and liquidity increases then volatility will smooth out over time.

How am I supposed to know how much it is going to cost? Does he have an attorney friend or relative?   You can initiate and file a complaint in the USA for like 289 dollars without having to hire a lawyer.   However, it's Canada so I don't think it's that much more.  Have the complaint served by an authorized third party for another few hundred.  The point is VOS will have to respond to the complaint and he can find out how to retrieve his funds.  Also, I highly doubt VOS wants to get sued for a mere 5k plus attorney's fees when they have another very successful venture they are doing now.  They will probably pay him the 5k and make him go away.   He needs to take some sort of action here or he can kiss his BTC goodbye.

It doesn't upset my worldview at all.  You're still young and have barely any real world experience paying your fair share into the system.  Raising marginal tax rates for  income brackets is different than raising capital gains taxes.  I agree that there should be a larger sliding scale of marginal tax rates.  However, that isn't what Bernie really wants.  He wants to raise the fuck out of the marginal tax rate for those making over 409k per year, bunching up all of the doctors, lawyers, accountants, small business owners...etc.  with the billionaires and multi-millionaires who make money by owning "things".   Newsflash: the doctors, lawyers, accountants, small business owners etc... are doing work.    So spare me the spin that Bernie is all about "fairness".  He's all about redistributing wealth to create a new socialist economic platform like Sweden.  
If you were truly about empathy and equality, then you would support a flat income tax for every American.  Plus, raising the tax on high income people who actually do "work" will not be beneficial to the economy or putting an end to class warfare.    The major problem, which Bernie does admit, is that the big corporations are putting money in tax deferred accounts overseas and hiding taxable money.  That's what's really going on.  The loopholes are the problem.  Closing the loopholes and keeping corporate money onshore is the answer.
Bring in Bernie and raise taxes on the hard working Americans in the upper class while raising tax 10% on the middle class, and watch how fast this economy is destroyed.   Redistributing wealth will not create more jobs.  His agenda is a gigantic socialist state that will take over your life in ways you can't even begin to imagine.  There are plenty of other candidates on both sides of the aisle trying to tackle income inequality and modifying the tax code. You don't have to support a socialist to achieve the change you're looking for.

I'm done with this and deleted my response to you.  I don't care to drag this out anymore.  OP probably won't do anything and take the 5k loss anyway.    I just was throwing out a longshot last resort option.  There's really not much he can do at this point.  Hire an attorney and sue(if he doesn't have a J.D. relative or friend), with a chance the costs could be huge, or try to file the complaint himself and save that initial attorney costs.  If it went to trial, then it would obviously get expensive with litigation.  The whole goal would be a settlement, which is what happens most of the time.     Or maybe OP doesn't have a case at all?  He'll need to actually explain the facts to an attorney who can at least let him know if his funds are legally recoverable, even if he files the complaint himself in small claims court.
If attorney tells him he does have a case, OP needs to crunch the numbers  to make sure it's worth it (time is money too).

LOL.. sure bud. You're sitting around getting in a pissing match with me because I gave OP some advice that could save him some money and possibly get his money back. If he doesn't want to pay the high attorney costs he has the right to file a small claims complaint without hiring an attorney by simply paying the court filing fees, which are in the hundreds of dollars and on the Canada attorney general website.  He then has to have it formally served so he has to hire an authorized third party to do so, which will run him another couple hundred.  Apparently you are the one who needs to be educated on Canada's legal system.  Maybe you should stick to eating nachos and watching the game instead of looking like a complete jackass assuming that this is some sort of trademark litigation that will run him 100k in attorney's fees.   This is something he can do relatively inexpensively and at least get a shot at getting some resolution since VOS will be forced to respond. Newsflash: VOS is not responding now.

How cool and catchy and easy it seems to be to take sharia law supporting muslims and try to integrate them in MASS into western societies.  What could possibly go wrong?  lol.  Oh, and by the way, you're a racist if you don't think this is a good idea.  What you will be seeing 10-15 years from now will be civil wars in Sweden, Italy, Germany, France and possibly the UK.  Then you will get your real fascism in Europe again.  By the way, I think the Aussies have shipped off some of their refugees to some neighboring islands. It would be interesting to find out how that is going.

I don't see any VC's, news programs, or anyone else discussing DogeCoin in any serious manner as a viable cryptocurrency. Is there anyone out there eagerly anticipating the launch of a DogeCoin ETF?   DogeCoin is considered a total joke and that is why none of the leading companies in Crypto support dogecoin.   Coinleap has an opportunity to be a leader in the crypto space.  I think ditching the childish crypto meme-coin is sound advice.

  You're a delusional if you think Trump laundered money from the Russian mob.   Impeachment?  You realize the whole Russia scandal is fake news and completely made up.  Did you read the wikileaks?   Podesta talks about it in his emails. Clinton and Podesta have all of the ties to Russia.  Hillary with her uranium scandal.  The podesta brothers ties to the Kremlin?  My god you people are insane.  Trump is NOT getting impeached. There is no scandal.  Nothing will come of this.  You guys are on your witch hunt for a smoking gun and it always ends up being nothing.  Pro Tip: stop watching fake news and buying into the MSM propaganda.  Myself, relatives, and friends will be happily voting for Trump in 2020.    You are going to need to deal with the reason why Hillary lost the election.  Dems have no message, no platform, just identity politics and scandals.  Unless that changes, they will get slaughtered again.  Dems have lowest representation in government since something like the 1930's.  Wow.  That should tell you something, but it doesn't since you are too delusional to notice blue collar America is dumping the Dems.  Your party is focused on calling everyone racits, xenophobes, islamaphoes, bigots, etc... basically anyone who disagrees with you.  lol That is not helping.    Continue the irrational Trump hate and we'll continue to clean up the mess that Obama left.    MAGA!

Seriously?  lol  You are arguing that a multi billionaire is a bad businessman?  You are absolutely clueless.  Cherry picking 3 things out of over 500 companies that Trump owned is so dumb.  So he's got a 97% success rate, not 100%.  He sucks!  Trump was so bad at being a "failed" billionaire that NBC hired him to create one of the most successful reality shows of all time.    Do you realize how dumb your argument is?
According to BusinessWeek, "the Trump Organization brought in about $605 million in revenue last year, and managed to clear somewhere between $275 and $325 million in profit. That’s a phenomenally high profit margin (which, of course, is a key sign of the health of a business). Trump’s approximately 50 percent margin means his company is more profitable than Pfizer, Gazprom, and Hyundai – all the most profitable companies in their respective industries. Trump’s company even has higher margins than Apple. Who knew? It turns out Steve Jobs was only “fair-to-middling” at running a business."
The Trump organization is one of the most successful real estate companies in the world.  Seriously, you honestly are just repeating mindless MSM BS about how Trump is a bad businessman when the evidence shows he's an amazing businessman.

Whose definition of the word?  Yours?  Please don't cite google's definition that was conveniently modified to add "right wing" in the definition during the 2016 election.  All other sources such as webster, dictionary.com, etc... do not mention right wing.  Apparently you can't look beyond the name "anti-facist". Fascists shut down free speech, resort to violence and intimidation tactics, in a fashion similar to the Nazi brown shirts.  Antifa carries out these tactics every day.   Yes, leftists can be fascists according to all major definition of fascism other than google's .   
  
For you to claim that you have a strong grasp of the definition of "fascism", please detail how Trump fits that definition or Jeff Sessions for that matter. Words have meaning but they don't have any merit if they aren't backed up by action.  Anyone can say they are for something but their actions show they are against the principles of what they are claiming to stand for.  Either way, Antifa is using "fascist" tactics to achieve their goal, whatever the hell that may be.  That is a fact that cannot be disputed.

Oh, thought you were an ETH troll. XRP is huge too. ETH was pumped crazy lately which explains market cap differential..  When alt bubble bursts so much will flow back into BTC. Also, once segwit activates, most alts are toast in my opinion.  ETH has promise but is not the same type of digital asset that BTC is.  They are different and could both independently be huge.  But BTC is a safer long term bet in my opinion.

If you can't see the reasons why as being crystal clear at this point, I don't know what to tell you.  By the way, I would agree with your position over the last 4 years before we faced pressure from alt coins.  However, I believe they are a real threat if BTC cannot find a solution to the scaling crises.  The crypto world is indirectly telling BTC to get scaling resolved soon or pay the price.   I'm supporting Segwit2x.  I feel like that is our last hope.
