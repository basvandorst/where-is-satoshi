Hope your not a developer building the next generation of financial tools for the people otherwise we might have a serious problem on our hands...

The problem with this post is that it is just as emotional and obsessed with price volatility as the bulls being critiqued. 
Not once did you mention value or what makes Bitcoin inherently less or more valuable, you didn’t refute the fundamentals, all you really said was “surely trillions of dollars won’t flow in, it’s just ridiculous and I’m sick of this”. (BTW, trillions of dollars flow in and out of different industries/commodities all the time, it’s not that unusual.)
I guess you were burned by the recent drops, I guess you care about price not value, I guess you’re no different to the people you’re critiquing.

I like this and I like doing this. Just search news on bitcoin to remind you that the reporting on why is essentially just volatility is all nonsense. It’s all “doom and gloom and moon” all at once, reminds me not to be swayed by the noise.

Agee. But all these services need to know there place. $1 is what the precise should be ongoing, $180 is more than nextflix.

Technical Trader: Bitcoin is going down to low 6000s...
Bitcoin: hold my candle.

Does this mean anything at all? Most bitcoiners try every and any new wallet or trading platform etc before settling on a hardware wallet or whatever for their hodling purposes. Hell, I probably have 100 dormant addresses. So what are we saying, exactly ??

I like the way people think quantum computing is bad for crypto. If it’s bad for crypto, the most powerful cryptography, EVERYTHING is fucked.

You’re looking at it the wrong way. These things don’t immediately turn on volume overnight, the point is that the pipes and plumbing are there so that in the next bill run, when the media turns to bitcoin and the FOMO kicks in and suddenly there is a ton of interest, you need the infrastructure in place to convert interest in to holdings. With an ETF, all the worlds millionaires will turn to there advisors and ask for some exposure, and if the worlds 1% have safe and well known routes to put 1% of their wealth in, you will see bitcoin explode and it will create a bigger, if not unprecedented, bull run. 
We are just laying the pipes, ladies and gentlemen.

Hard to say, right? You’d be a very rich man if you could say exactly when the music stops. The fed has committed to QE until Q2 next year so I’d expect the equities to continue to grow until then, at least. But make no mistake, there is something like 200 trillion in debt accumulated across the word which has never been seen before, putting us into one of the craziest experiments the world has ever seen. To be honest, the catalyst itself doesn’t matter, something will break and the whole thing is going to implode.

TLDR; you value BTC by its network effect, not by the technology alone.

Tell me when you see an 80% correction and you don’t sell it.
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:15:29
Yeah but the best way to go is to NOT short equities to try and capitalise on this. You can buy bonds but ONLY if you predict interest rates will continue to go down. Or you can hedge against the devaluation of your local currency by finding a store of value like gold- which is already running high over the last few years as the smart money moves out of equities. There are other recession portfolio moves that will likely only give you a small return in nominal terms, but if equities/property end up having a 40% correction, you just made that in real terms. Same goes with fiat.
The thing is, you don’t have to predict the exact timing crash, just slowly start hedging it, moving money out of traditional assets that will run higher, and if you are correct and a recession hits within a 1-2 year time frame, you’ll see substantial upside by preserving your existing wealth as it stands today against those who do not.

No signs of a recession? What the fuck are you talking about? Do you not include record corporate debt, the fed printing money, the QE happening across the world, the trillions in negative yield treasury bonds, the race to the bottom with fiat and the global currencies crashing...
No signs?
@_date: 2019-12-28 02:01:48
Depends on the type of recession:
Depression era crash: not good
Japanification: very good

That’s volatility, It’s currently down from 14k 6 months ago, potentially going the through a full market cycle since a blow off euphoric top.
We’re all waiting for BTC to bottom before the next bull market. How can this possibly be peak FOMO? 
Do you really think it’s mooning right now, as we speak?

I am definitely stamping every note I get. Can’t think of a better way to broadcast the revolution.
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:14:58
It’s currently dumping in a bear market. How are people being greedy right now?
I literally think the opposite; ppl are being fearful and now is the time to be buying in.

11k will still 10x in the next few years. We're not in this for the 5% gains... 1000% gains dont come without 80% retracements to the downside, but given the return, just focus on the long term.
