Very nice!
I dread to think what your electric bill is going to be like! 
Good luck to you :)

Noob questions, but how much are you expecting these to yield and/or how long do you think it’s going to take you to break even?

The most confusing thing about Binance, from a total “wtf am I doing, why did I even think I could try this?” Point of view was the lack of fiat&lt;-&gt; crypto ability. Once i realised it was crypto-&gt;crypto exchange, it was fairly self explanatory ..

* On the 22nd of December, 2017 Kjell, through his company Monopolip LTD (also founded on the 22nd of December 2017)[12], was able to register the trademark 'Bitcoin'[13] in the UK in a process known as "patent trolling" [14] and is believed to be sending threatening letters to manufacturers of merchandise and souvenirs of the digital currency.*
What a moron.

Thanks for the advice! Quick google and 5 mins later and the funds, as small as they are, are secure.
Appreciate the help.
Sometimes it feels like a need to learn the entirety of Wikipedia before fully grasping this stuff. But as I get to grips with the basics, hopefully I can invest more.
Thanks again!

Sorry, that’s what I meant yeh.
Originally purchase through Coinbase, send to GDAX, then out to wallet.

I literally did my first transaction yesterday, only £30 as I wanted to be familiar with the systems before doing more.
Went with coinbase to purchase, the iOS app is nice and clean/simple and it was recommended by the ‘official’ sources. 
Thanks to the advice here, I’ve since (obviously) learnt that GDAX is part of coinbase. 
Coinbase &gt; Electrum enacts a heft fee
Coinbase&gt;GDAX&gt;Electrum doesn’t 
Quite ridiculous really, but GDAX looks like a really interesting source for upto date info so the advice helped more than one way!
I’m incredibly new to all this, I remember seeing bitcoin appear Year’s ago but never having the funds or the knowledge to put something aside, utterly gutting! But live and learn!

GDAX was a lot more complicated to add funds/buy as it seems mostly targeted at American users. Just for pure ease of use, I’ll probably continue with Coinbase unless there is another service provider with significantly less fees whilst also being somewhat ‘n00b friendly’.

I brought my first investment in bitcoin yesterday using Coinbase based on recommendations from here and bitcoin.org.
£15 purchase in bitcoin resulted in me actually getting £14.11. Then went to try and transfer it to an electrum wallet and would have ended up with £11 in value remaining.
I suspect I’m doing something seriously wrong here to lose nearly 30% of stock value between purchase and wallet transfer?

When new people are asking for first time help, the acronyms make it pretty hard. I know so little about the whole process but keen to get involved, but I spend more time trying to decipher the help that people are offering than I do understanding it.
Not a personal dig, but your post prompted the thought for the 100th time.
