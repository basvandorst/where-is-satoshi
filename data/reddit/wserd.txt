lol I'm not a troll, there are a bunch of good reasons not to use Uphold. Regardless, if they are suing Andreas or not, I advise anyone asking for advice not to use them. 
1) Coinapult offers a similar product
2) Coinapult is not hostile towards Bitcoin (Halsey Minor, Founder of Uphold) has pitched his investors that Bitcoin is doomed for failure, and has spoken in public about this belief)
3) Uphold has a huge stake in a worthless premined cryptocurrency called Voxel. Which brings up questions of their future solvency if Voxel fails.
4) Uphold is based in America and has to comply with all American regulations. Similar to Coinbase, they can be compelled by the government to freeze your account at any moment.
5) Coinapult requires no identity information to setup an account.
Those are all facts. If you still want to use Uphold while knowing those facts, feel free. The choice is yours.

"Bitcoin traded as high as $252.05 on the Bitstamp exchange on Tuesday, its strongest in over two months, before easing a little to $245.21, still up around 4 percent on the day. That marked its sixth straight session of gains -- its best run since January 2014."

Zhao posted his claims only 4 days ago, and none of the main Bitcoin news sites picked it up. Furthermore, Zane Tackett publicly backed Zhao's claims in this thread for the first time.
I'm not "late to the OKC drama," it's only just started. The writing was on the wall for almost a year before the Gox collapse but a ton of people were still suprised when it went down. The people who waited for hard proof for Gox were the ones who lost their money, because when that proof was finally released, it was too late.
I made it very clear in my post that there is no hard proof and that it is mainly based on red flags and gut feeling. Also it is worth noting that I often frequent the Whaleclub TS and that our price index is the only one I know of that includes OKCoin pricing data. I also understand that OKCoin provides way more options for heavy traders, such as yourself, compared to the other exchanges. 
As always, you can make your own decision on how to proceed. I just wanted to make it clear to my users that  my opinion is they should cease trading and remove funds from OKCoin for the time being, and see how this all plays out.

It's all about adoption. If adoption increases then price will increase. One of Bitcoin's core value propositions is the ability for a user to protect their funds from seizure. When governments seize funds, they are basically advertising the importance of such a feature. It should therefore increase adoption, increasing bitcoin price. 
In the mean time, you could also deal with volatility by using  or a pegged crypto such as nubits, bitusd,  or tether.

Because even if you have a full block at default fees, it only gets you $50 extra dollars and you run a higher risk of getting an orphan and losing the block reward.
TL:DR: $$
Edit: The current block reward is 25btc, which is roughly $6000. It's not worth it for them to risk $6000 for $15.

Ulbircht was careless and cocky. Three things.
First, he must have stored a bunch of the private keys really poorly.
Second, they threatened him with  harsher sentence if he didn't give up his remaining keys.
Third, we don't know if they actually got all of his coins. He could still have some secret addresses that they aren't aware of.

Since launching almost a year ago we have amassed a database of nearly 2k articles and blog posts that can easily be searched directly on our homepage.  We link only to the original source whenever possible, don't post duplicate links, and avoid sites that have advertising and editorial practices that take advantage of naive/new users. We also provide comprehensive yet easy to understand original content.

Bitcoin payment processors will become commoditized. Due to the nature of Bitcoin, it's much easier to open a competing payment processor than with credit cards etc. And all those payment processors will constantly be battling each other for as low fees as possible. Those fees will get really close to zero due to free market competition. BitPay had first mover advantage, but the writing is on the wall, it makes sense that they are looking for alternative monetization strategies.
"Hoarding" bitcoin gives it value. Having more places where you can spend bitcoin gives it value. Price is based on supply and demand. The more people saving bitcoin, the less supply available, the higher the price goes. I go into more depth in the link I posted above. My point is that Bitcoin needs both spenders and savers for it to grow.

As long as you have control of the private keys you should be fine(Armory, Mycelium, and Coinkite). That being said, you still need to rely on the software developers of the specific wallet you use. I would definitely avoid Green Address because you don't have complete control over your private keys, as Green Address needs to sign all of your transactions.
The safest method in my opinion would be to store all your coins in cold storage paper wallets before the fork. Then you know for sure you have complete control of your private keys and you don't need to rely on the software developers of any specific software. 
We host an easy to follow paper wallet cold storage guide here:

Good point. Just matters how stubborn the other devs are at that point.
This all moot though, because Gavin would only do the XT option as a last resort. When he originally announced the potential XT fork, he was stuck in a stand still where the other devs basically told him a block size increase would never happen, regardless of what users and other stake holders think. It also has the secondary effect of scaring the other devs since they could lose the power commit access gives them if XT were to succeed. Gavin needed to show that he still had at least some power to fight them on it, and that's what the XT plan is for.
It looks like the 8MB plan is starting to gather some consensus, and hopefully the other devs will be willing to compromise. 1MB is just not going to cut it in the short term.  Even 2MB would be a huge improvement.

"The result of a hard fork is two block chains growing independently of each other from the point of the fork. Essentially two independent “coins” emerge (let's call them bitcoin1 and bitcoin2), and however much bitcoin you own pre-fork will be duplicated to both bitcoin1 and bitcoin2. This is important because it means that as long as you control your own private keys, you WILL NOT lose any bitcoin during the hard fork process."

You could give it to them in person. Or call them on the phone and tell it to them (not completely secure but means an attacker would need to have your phone line tapped). You could also give them a clue over an unsecured channel that the other person can figure out the password from.

We force a fork and let the free market decide which version of Bitcoin is more valuable.
Edit: I posted this below but it's worth repeating: 
It should be treated as a last case scenario. A failsafe if politics results in grid lock .  
The cool thing is that anyone can create their own client that forks Bitcoin, and if the free market thinks it is valuable then it could succeed (with marketing and outreach before then). It wouldn't be pretty,  but it's almost elegant in a way. A free market at work, deciding which upgrades have value and which do not.

Best/simplest metaphor for OPs question.
Edit: If OP wants a more detailed answer:
"Bitcoin's greatest value proposition is as a secure store of value that cannot be seized or blocked by governments or corporations. This capability has never been possible before in human history. If we all agree that there is tremendous value in an independent / decentralized wealth storage system then the price of bitcoin should rise as more and more people store their wealth in bitcoin. This is not "hoarding." Hoarding is intentionally a negative word, this is individuals saving their money, just like buying gold or putting your money in a a savings account isn't considered "hoarding." Our societies have encouraged spending over saving for decades through the implementation of worldwide fiat currencies with built-in inflation. It is time to remove the stigma of saving your money. For the first time in almost half a century, the average person can once again safely store their wealth and watch it appreciate in value so their children can have a better life. Bitcoin enables secure wealth storage in a way that doesn't rely on governments or corporations and goes above that even, since it also enables users to easily transfer that wealth to others."

Kidding aside, if Bitcoin fails, another alt besides LTC will take the throne. LTC doesn't have enough changes implemented in to it to make it competitive against the vast number of alts on the market. It is too similar to Bitcoin.

I agree with all of the above except that I theorize that the free market will decide the fate of the two forks rather quickly, because it is a positive feedback loop.
"If one block chain doesn't become the dominant one right away, the free market will ultimately step in to decide on a “winning” chain. Exchanges will begin allowing users to trade bitcoin1 for bitcoin2 and vice versa, and the free market will decide on the value of each. As it becomes clear that one of the “coins” is valued much higher than the other, stakeholders such as miners, full node operators, and Bitcoin companies will end up choosing the fork with the higher value. As more of these stakeholders choose the higher value fork, the value difference between the two forks will diverge at an increasing rate, ultimately resulting in one fork having basically no value as users rush to sell all their coins in that fork for ones in the more valuable fork. This process should happen quite quickly as it is a positive feedback loop. If you are the gambling type, the situation presents an opportunity to make a lot of money (or lose a lot on the opposite side), but if you are conservative then you can just take a wait and see approach and your bitcoin will not be at risk."

There's no way to confidently prove if someone is running a fully contributing node. It would be trivial to run nodes that don't actually contribute, and collect your theoretical "node fees" in that scenario. That's why miners are required to do proof of work, it proves that they contribute.

respect you a ton. You need to start playing politics and be a public leader in the debate. I know it's not ideal, and I'm sure you are extremely busy, but it is what it is. We need solutions, not just theories, the block size limit will begin having consequences sooner than most realize. 
The "stress tests" have already shown that it is rather trivial and relatively inexpensive to launch a ddos style attack on the network by intentionally filling up blocks with many small transactions. The network needs to be as robust as possible for it to succeed on a global scale.

The safest method in my opinion would be to store all your coins in cold storage paper wallets before the fork. Then you know for sure you have complete control of your private keys and you don't need to rely on the software developers of any specific software.

@_date: 2015-06-24 21:59:06
Regardless of the current block size argument, I think it is ridiculous to think that the core devs sit on top of some podium that we can't remove them from. They aren't infallible and we shouldn't treat them as such. Especially when most of them work for private companies with objectives/biases of their own.
Furthermore,  in this specific case, I think Gavin and Hearn would be willing to give other devs commit access to XT if that became the standard. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:42:13
I never said that. All I'm saying is that the Core Devs shouldn't be treated as the absolute authority regarding protocol upgrades. They shouldn't get unchecked veto power. Bitcoin hard forks essentially allow the free market to decide if a new feature adds value to the protocol. 
Edit: I hash out my thought process here: 
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:05:01
To elaborate on comment:
"The result of a hard fork is two block chains growing independently of each other from the point of the fork. Essentially two independent “coins” emerge (let's call them bitcoin1 and bitcoin2), and however much bitcoin you own pre-fork will be duplicated to both bitcoin1 and bitcoin2. This is important because it means that as long as you control your own private keys, you WILL NOT lose any bitcoin during the hard fork process."
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:59:41
True, but if fees become too large, users will move to cheaper alternatives, including other cryptocurrencies. Even a 10 cent fee will push users sending $2 or less to other options. A 5% fee isn't very competitive.  
Edit: Also,  "replace by fee" seems promising (I really like the "free market" basis behind it) but it will make double spending much easier and harder to detect/predict. For one, it would pretty much make BlockCypher's Confidence Score irrelevant.

Huge conflict of interest imo. More so than the blockstream devs.
Not increasing the block size directly benefits other digital currencies with larger capacities, including Litecoin which has a cap of 1MB every 2.5 minutes, which comes out to 4x Bitcoin's block size cap. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:04:58
Miners will always be able to institute their own soft limits. That being said, many miners are currently mining the max block size of 1MB and the hard limit restricts them. They should have the option to create bigger blocks if they choose to.

Circle.com is really useful for purchasing coins. They make it really easy. However, when it comes to storing coins, you are better off using GreenAddress.it. This is because Circle has complete access to your coins and can freeze your account at will. This could be due to government intervention, a fraud prevention measure, or because the site has been hacked.  
GreenAddress.it cannot seize or freeze your funds.
Buy your bitcoin at Circle and then send them to your greenaddress.it wallet to store them.

made this comment regarding the transactions in &gt;I'm reasonably certain I've found the identity behind that address. The answer is pretty boring, not worth taking away whatever temporary privacy the owner might still have. If I'm correct, it's an early adopter I had never heard of before this week. I think the most likely reason for this move is to increase the security of their wallet, so it wouldn't be very nice of me to expose them in the middle of their reorganization.


So I would say that this is an early adopter looking to secure his coins better.  If testname33 can figure out who he is then its presumable others could figure it out too.  Owning that much btc puts a real target on his back.

From the other perspective.  If you had already made a bc.i backup you wouldn't even have to wait for blockchain support to send you the backup.  If greenaddress.it goes down you have to wait for the nlocktime to expire before you have access to your funds.
They both provide much different value propositions.  With bc.i you have complete control of your funds but that means that if you're not careful you could lose everything.  With greenaddress you don't have complete control of your funds but at least they can't run away with your coins and it takes the responsibility of securing coins away from the end user.

According to Bitcoin Rich list, there are 46,561,030 addresses that have had at least some amount of bitcoin in them at some point, with 1,643,642 addresses that have had atleast .001 bitcoin in them:
It's hard to put an exact figure on it, but the one thing we know for sure is that there definitely have not been more than 2M unique users. Regardless, of the exact number, that is fucking tiny. There are 350M people in America and almost 7 Billion worldwide.

Until hardware wallets like Trezor come out, the safest way for people to store their coins are in paper wallets.
Use a computer that you will never connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets.   You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  offline.   You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print  outs. 
Alternatively you can buy  which is a turn key solution for paper wallet generation. Essentially it's a purpose built computer/printer that never connects to the Internet. You just press a button and a new wallet is generated and printed.

They also own blockchain.com which is arguably a much more valuable domain for mainstream users, so they wont be switching their name to "blockchain.info" either.

We aren't just saying "pay them back in USD" , we are saying that all bitcoin transactions should be pegged to the local currency for now.  That goes for purchases, returns, everything.  Its not like stores are going to go through all their products and individually reprice everything in BTC, thats ridiculous.

True. Tipping services will be commoditized soon enough. Just as block explorers are now compared to a year ago when blockchain.info was the clear leader. Not to mention you can always tip on blockchain using native Bitcoin protocol by just putting a tip address in your signature.
That being said, it is still very valuable to be the first mover, especially with something like tipping where having a large # of users makes the service much more useful/seamless.

Use a computer that you will never connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets.   You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  offline.   You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print  outs. 
Alternatively you can buy  which is a turn key solution for paper wallet generation. Essentially it's a purpose built computer/printer that never connects to the Internet. You just press a button and a new wallet is generated and printed.

TLDR: 
"Here, at CoinPrices, we are currently generating zero revenue. Our mission is to provide our users an easy way to cut through all the bullshit that exists in the current digital currency news space. We love Bitcoin, altcoins, open source development, crypto, and everything they represent. We believe that the ideals represented by the open source and crypto community has the potential to change the world as we know it; using decentralization to make the world a better place. We consistently link to and support outside sources that we feel contribute compelling content on Bitcoin and related digital currencies, we don't write "linkbait" articles that do little more than trick you into coming to our sites, and we don't spam your email and twitter feed with repetitive useless "news."
It is important to us that our readers realize that when it comes to news sources, there is no absolute rule you can follow. Be wary of some of the digital currency focused news sites but also realize that some of the mainstream news sites such as CNN, HuffPo, Forbes, BusinessInsider, are just as guilty of focusing on revenue over the best interests of their users. The other day we caught the WSJ falsely claiming on twitter that the Bank of Russia has begun allowing Bitcoin payments when their own article contradicted them. WSJ didn't care, they were just trying to generate retweets and drive traffic to their site. You just have to always be aware of the bias presented by news sources and the author and you have to take it into account. The more news sources you read the better, and you should use them collectively to develop your own opinions/ideas/conclusions."

We do not accept money for any articles. No sponsored articles. In fact, we dont even run ads. We run purely on tips, donations, and our own funds.

Altcoins could be the off-blockchain method of handling micro transactions (off the Bitcoin blockchain that is). For instance, Bitcoin would be used for large transactions and as a store of value and then altcoins would exist with less fees and quicker confirmation time. 
Companies would be developed that move you onto the altcoin blockchain seamlessly in order to process microtransactions and in person transactions. Then you can move your funds back into your "savings account" which would be a wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain. That way all transactions still happen on a blockchain, just not the Bitcoin blockchain.  
You could even use the Ripple protocol or something similar to convert between the two blockchains, so you don't have to trust a third party for the conversion.

You are connected to the internet during the entire setup process, either Coinbase or an outside malicious actor can compromise your computer to steal two of the three keys and/or your encryption password. This is particularly easy for Coinbase since they are the ones sending the code to your computer.
In some situations it could be even less secure than the regular Coinbase "vault" because an attacker can bypass 2Factor Authentication using 2 of the 3 private keys.
That being said, Coinbase needed to weigh user friendliness with security. It's a great first step. More secure implementations will come in the future.

Tails is completely privacy focused. It is much more secure than Ubuntu but less convenient. Maybe use Ubuntu or another Linux distribution as your daily OS and then use a USB stick with Tails on it for anything that you need to be more secure.
As far as Tor goes, it is built into Tails which makes it extremely convenient.  It's free and P2P based so it will always be slower than regular internet. If you want a faster alternative, one option is to pay for a VPN service.
There are many different VPN services available, make sure the one you choose is located outside of the US and has a good track record. To help protect your identity when purchasing the VPN, I would suggest using Tor and pay with bitcoin at the time of purchase.

The bitcoin is transferred instantly but it will take on average 10 minutes to be confirmed and ready to send again in your account. Sometimes it can take as little as 2 minutes or as long as an hour, but on average it is 10 minutes. 
Yes, the amount of bitcoin you have isn't changing, just the exchange rate for the bitcoin in USD. Also keep in mind, that changetip and circle.com use different exchange rate sources. There is no single OFFICIAL price.
My site combines a bunch of exchanges to come up with a single bitcoin index price. There are other sites that do the same thing.

Satoshi's original white paper can be found here: 
Charts for all major exchanges can be found at: 
Remember to use log scale when comparing the charts over a year.  It essentially shows the graph in percent increases rather than absolute dollar amounts.  So the increase from 50 cents to a dollar shows up the same as the increase from $200 to $400.
Remember to focus on total market cap (currently around 9.5b) rather than price per coin because bitcoins are infinitely divisible.
I'm on my phone so that's all i can contribute off the top of my head, hope it helps. Good luck on that paper..

Just to put this in perspective. At Over 3M Viewers, more people viewed the Bitcoin Bowl Game than have ever used Bitcoin. Conservative Estimates put the total number of Unique Bitcoin Users somewhere around 1.5/2M.
Edit: Just to clarify, by conservative estimate, I mean the top end of the possible # of unique users. At most, there have been 1.5M/2M unique users, and that number is probably way higher than actual users. And by unique users, I mean anyone that has even played around with the tiniest amount of bitcoin.
The point is, that we got a ton of visibility from the bitcoin bowl with way more viewers than current users.

When you use Venmo, you are really sending Venmo IOU notes. If your bank transfer turns out to be fraud, Venmo still has control of all the funds being transferred between you and your friends.
Bitcoin transactions are very different because they cannot be revoked. All transactions are final. So if there is bank fraud, but the bitcoin has already been transferred, the company ends up taking huge losses. This is why that cant happen.
Alternatively, I forsee a future where you will able to fund your Venmo, Google Wallet, Paypal, etc accounts with bitcoin and then transfer their IOUs seamlessly within their system and then withdraw directly to an independent bitcoin address. Thats something completely different though.

You are correct that DVD-Rs are better because they can't be written to once you have burned Tails onto it. I just said USB because a lot of computers don't even have disc drives anymore.
As far as a VPN is concerned. I use mine all the time.  Most VPNs are fast enough that you won't notice any considerable slow down of your internet, pick a reputable one. Since a lot of ISPs slow down your internet depending on what you are using it for, VPNs can actually increase your real life speed because the ISP can't see your traffic. Most people don't realize it but VPNs are in effect, a technical solution to the net neutrality debate. If all traffic is encrypted, then your ISP can't filter your traffic even if they want to.
Edit: The good VPNs will let you choose from multiple servers located throughout the world. This allows you to access content that is otherwise restricted by geolocation. That alone is extremely useful.
TL;DR I recommend to anyone who asks to invest in a good VPN.

June 28th was when they released the voting results for the p2pool move: 
- Yes, PetaMine should switch over to P2Pool – 96%
- No, PetaMine should stay with ghash.io – 3%
- No, Petamine should switch to another pool like Eligius or BTCGuild – 1%
They announced the vote would be taking place on June 20th. That means it has been over 3 weeks since they first considered p2pool and it has been over 2 weeks since the vote results have been released. 
We shouldn't expect them to switch overnight but exactly how much time should we be giving them? They haven't even given us an update on the situation for over 2 weeks.  
Also, their reasoning for the delay is an incompatibility of their BitFury ASICs with p2pool but a solution was posted on reddit over two weeks ago: 
Last but not least, if they really cannot move over to p2pool for technical reasons then they should at least choose a smaller pool that doesn't have as much hashing power as Ghash.

It's based on network propagation.  The idea being that if it is sent around enough of the network it becomes much more difficult and expensive to double spend it.  Blockchain.info does something similar but they just call it network propagation percentage.  As long as it is small amounts, it should be safe to use that measurement to accept a zero confirm transaction because it would cost way more than the amount of the transaction to execute a double spend.  It is also worth noting that as bitcoin price goes up, the amount that you can safely accept in a zero confirm bitcoin transaction goes up because the cost of executing a double spend goes up.  
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:43:06
Yup, bitcoin is a global movement. If the NY regulations, and by default the future US federal regulations, are too strict then we will see tons of businesses move overseas. 
This phenomenon isn't unique to bitcoin though. If you look at US government policy, tech and internet businesses are being forced to move elsewhere. Between the Snowden revelations and the lack of government action regarding them, and the fall of net neutrality, it makes less and less sense for internet based businesses to open up shop in America. 
Its really sad and shortsighted, as a country we (America) are going to miss out on a ton of growth.

Yes. Microtransactions will not be practical cost wise. I envision a future where bitcoin will be used as a store of value and for large transactions because it is deflationary and has a powerful/secure network.
Certain alts will fill key niches, such as microtransactions. For example, an Alt that is inflationary can be way more cost efficient than bitcoin ever could be when it comes to micro transactions. Dogecoin is a perfect example of this in its current form. I imagine there will be companies that will allow you to seamlessly switch between blockchains of different coins to make this even easier.
Also companies like coinbase and changetip will allow their users to conduct microtransactions off the blockchain. Then users would only need to deal with tx fees when depositing/withdrawing from the service.

Correct. You can keep creating new addresses though and send your bitcoin to new addresses as often as possible. This makes it difficult for a person looking at the blockchain to figure out which addresses you control from the addresses  you merely paid.
That being said, this is exactly why mixing services are so essential to maintaining financial privacy when using Bitcoin. There was a post on the front page of r/bitcoin yesterday discussing the top mixing services.

Since you are planning to hold the coins for awhile, you should make proper paper wallets. Your wallet isn't true cold storage because Coinbase still has a copy of your private keys and it was generated online so that opens you up to more attack scenarios.

Escrow services.  They take a fee and hold on to the buyers money until the seller delivers the goods and services. The bitcoin protocol has a method built in that allows there to be 3 keys where 2 of them are needed to initiate a transfer.  This allows a situation where the escrow agent cannot walk away with the money, they can only choose to refund it to the buyer or issue it to the seller.

Also don't forget about darkcoin. It was basically premined. There was a "glitch" in the first 24 hours that the client was released that allowed founder and his friends to instamine DRK. Now 60% of all DRK in circulation is controlled by only a few people. When they decide to sell, the price is going to tank.

I would recommend not to use Coinbase to generate your paper wallet. They could very well have access to your private key and since the wallet is generated online it is more vulnerable than it needs to be.

I like this idea. Take it a step further and give another lawyer the bip38 private keys and have him mail it to them on their 17th birthday so they don't misplace the keys. I say 17th birthday so it isn't sent in the mail at the same time as the password.

I'm not affiliated with them in any way.  I just am worried about this whole GHASH thing and felt guilty about not contributing anything to the network myself.  I did my research and this seems like the best option given the situation.  I plan on buying 5 GH/S myself later today, moving some coin out of cold storage right now.
Edit: Also the VPS where I run a full node isn't going to make me any ROI either and costs me $10/mo.  I do it to help the network.  For less than a $200 one time fee, it is a steal compared to the price of my VPS and it does more to protect the network than my full node does.

You should not expect a financial return from an "investment" in ether. You should only contribute if you believe in their mission and the devs involved like Vitalik. 
Ether will have built in inflation. It will not have a fixed number of coins like Bitcoin has. At this time, that % isn't even known yet because Ethereum is still a work in progress and ether don't actually exist at this time. Furthermore, there is no cap to the pre-sale, so as more BTC is contributed it devalues the stake of the people who have already contributed BTC.
Edit: Even if Ethereum is wildly successful, which I hope it will be, you still will NOT make your money back from purchasing ether now.

US based companies are served secret court orders that they must comply with or risk fines/jail time. Jail time for the CEO of course, you can't put a company in jail. This is fact. One only needs to look at what happened to Lavabit.com as an example.
Read this, it's from the founder of Lavabit. The only reason we know about this is because this dude has balls of steel and a ton of integrity.(which I linked to in OP): 
Non-US based companies are not automatically perfect, but US based companies are absolutely compromised and should not be trusted. On top of that, if a company outside of the US uses proper end to end encryption, then the technological gathering capabilities of America and our allies is greatly diminished. Intelligence agencies are usually still able to do targeted attacks against specific individuals, through their many means of accessing systems and other connected electronics, but they are prevented from doing the mass dragnet surveillance that American companies are forced to comply with. 
When it comes to privacy and security across the internet, there is no perfect solution. That being said, there are simple steps to make the situation better than it is. Open source software is key, as well as supporting companies located in regions of the world that have shown respect for user and corporate privacy.

Completely agree with this. Especially since most merchants instantly convert to fiat, adding sell pressure, and driving the price down.
Bitcoin's key features are protection from govt interference (hard for them to seize your money), anonymous online transactions, and international transactions, especially for digital goods. 
Also it isn't controlled by a central authority, such as the Fed, who prints out an endless amount of dollars, devaluing our savings.
Edit: Also, Bitcoin makes storing your wealth, without a third party (such as a bank), easier and more secure than ever before in human history. I watched this shitty movie last night, and the main character was a criminal in the 60s and he was traveling all around Europe with thousands of dollars in US cash. Bitcoin makes this seem so antiquated but besides Bitcoin, the cash in suitcase method is really the only alternative. Crazy to think about.

You usually don't even need to forward the port, it supposed to automatically do it. Once Bitcoin Core is completely synced, hover your mouse over the connections indicator in the bottom right corner, if it shows over 8, then everything is working as it should.
If it only shows 8 or less, then you have to forward the port on your router.
Does that make sense?

SSD's cost more money per GB than traditional hard drives.  This will allow people who have their primary drive as an ssd to save space on that drive and use a secondary hard disk to store the block chain.  
That being said.  I run my bitcoin node on a dedicated PC with a 128gb ssd.  Built it through new egg for less than $400.  SSDs are better for storing the block chain because it requires a lot of reads and writes which degrades traditional hard disks over time.

I guess it is Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt but it's not unfounded.  The truth of the matter is because it is closed source you are trusting lastpass with all of your passwords.  You are officially putting all of your eggs in one basket.  I'm going to copy and paste what i wrote further down in this comment chain:
They tell you that its all client side encryption,  but you have to take their word for it because its closed source.  If they want to install a backdoor into the iOS app for instance, you would never know if they siphoned off your master encryption password and kept it in a database.
Edit: Look at what the US govt  tried to do to lava bit.  All of their encryption happened client side but they wanted the owner to install a backdoor in the software to collect the encryption keys.  They even gave him a gag order so he couldn't tell anyone.  He chose to close up shop.  You have to trust that lastpass has the same amount of integrity when you use their product.

True, PIA should be sufficient to thwart Comcast but if you are going to go through the effort to purchase a VPN, you might as well take the extra step to use one located outside of America.
The [Lavabit](  case shows us that American based companies most likely keep logs and give them to the US govt. 
If you care about your privacy, don't route all your sensitive internet traffic through a company located in America.

First and foremost, you should check out . It is a great resource.
I wholeheartedly disagree with those who are telling you to store your coins with coinbase. With coinbase you don't control your private keys, so if their site goes down or if they decide to not allow you to withdraw, then you are shit out of luck. This goes against the main philosophy around Bitcoin, having complete control of your own money.
If you plan on holding that Bitcoin for more than a couple of months then I highly suggest you move your coins over to cold storage. I wrote up a beginners guide to paper wallets here, hope it helps:

Offline computer is much safer.  Or if you make a bip38 paper wallet on an offline computer and store it somewhere safe.  That way you have two layers of security: its hidden, and if someone finds it they still need a password to get your funds.
Giving a third party your private keys is careless, even if they are bip38 encrypted.

Blockchain.info has an option to send your coins using coinjoin.   You can choose how many repetitions, the more you choose the better your send and receive addresses are concealed.  In this case you still have to trust that blockchain.info isnt keeping logs.  To better protect from that, you can use a vpn or tor to conceal your IP address from blockchain. It just matters who you are trying to protect your info from and how paranoid you want to be.
There are also dedicated mixing sites. Most are located only through tor connections but I know of one that isn't.  HTTPS://WWW.bitmixer.io. I have never used it so use at your own risk.  Once again you have to trust that they aren't keeping logs, but if they aren't then there should be absolutely no way for someone to track your coins through the blockchain.  The idea is simple, you send them coins, they take out their fee, then they send the same amount of coins from a different address of theirs to your destination address.

One of the key differences, in this case, is that most people don't even understand how the status quo works. If they don't understand how our current financial/money system operates, it is that much harder to explain the benefits an alternative decentralized system, such as Bitcoin, brings to the table.

How do we know that the Piper isn't generating keys in an insecure fashion, like using a specific random seed or a bad source of entropy?
You can see the full source code for yourself and build your own Piper if you wish. You can load your own address generation software on to Piper. You can plug Piper into your TV/Monitor and Mouse and Keyboard and use the BitAddress.org client which is included with Piper and the source is cleartext since it's javascript. Piper also has a hardware random number generator built in, and it has passed all 26 of the "good" Dieharder tests for secure random number generation. [Test Info]( - [Results](

Nope.  Still much less. Credit card fees are around 3-5%. Paypal fees are 2.9% + $.30 per transaction. The fee for a bitcoin escrow service would be a lot less than that.  They don't have the overhead requirements because it is built into the protocol so they are never holding anyone's money.  Also the free market will mean that competing escrow services will drive their fees down.

I would suggest  because it uses a 2 of 2 multi sig system which means both you and them have to sign off on a transaction. This allows your friend to have 2 factor authentication protecting his coins while the site isn't able to steal his coins.
If he plans to hold his coins for awhile then he should use cold storage: 
For a day to day transaction hot wallet, I would suggest Mycelium for android.

Exactly. It really bothers me how many people are in it to "get rich quick," thinking its going to be like the early days of Bitcoin again. Those people are going to be devastated when they finally realize whats happening. I also think it is a little disingenuous of the Ethereum team not to make that more clear. It's basically a "kickstarter" campaign. 
The only good reason to "invest" in ether is because you believe in the team and their goals. People will not make a financial return on their investment.

@_date: 2014-11-26 13:42:26
Here's one:
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:56:25
Definitely use bip38, its extremely simple to setup through bitaddress.org and even a shitty password will give you an extra layer of security. 
As for your other question, it matters how much btc you are storing and how much risk you are willing to take.   
If you use a computer and printer that will never be connected to the internet again, you can pretty much guarantee your coins will be 100% secure. As long as you dont store a digital version of your paper wallet on an internet connected device or online. And as long as a malicious individual doesn't get physical access to your computer/printer.
Some people don't want to spend money on a dedicated computer for paper wallets.   If you have an old computer, that can get the job done but just make sure you never connect it to the internet again.
If you dont have an old computer, and dont want to buy one,  then you can use a live linux cd.  I recommend tails because it is security focused and supposedly wipes all traces of info on system reboot. You boot from the live linux cd/usb and generate the paper wallets in linux. Since this scenario still involves you connecting the computer back to the internet in the future,  it can't be considered 100% secure but its pretty damn close. 
Or you can buy the piper paper wallet printer at piperwallet.com. It is a dedicated offline computer and printer that prints secure paper wallets with the push of a button.   Its about $200 USD I believe, and you can buy it with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:40:26
Completely agree. I don't feel comfortable sharing my private keys with anyone, even if bip38 encrypted.
Personally I don't feel comfortable having encrypted private keys touch the internet even, no dropbox etc. (For longterm savings / cold storage)
Edit: Also, these types of products (metal wallet cards etc) encourage address reuse, which has privacy and security implications.

This is one of the issues that I feel like the Mycelium Entropy team hasn't properly addressed. 
A solid option for beginners is to invest in a [Piper Wallet Printer]( which is a purpose built offline linux computer/printer combo that can print secure paper wallets.

Notice that we suggest using a printer that does not have WiFi or that is used for anything other than printing wallets. We also suggest, when large amounts of $$ is involved to destroy both the computer and printer that you used to generate/print your wallets.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:00:58
I wouldn't suggest this. Definitely easier to use a mixing service. Your method relies on using two exchanges and monero's wallet doesn't even have a GUI, not user friendly. 
I would recommend  or  Both are pretty easy to use. 
Personally I believe that mixing services are essential tools to protect our financial privacy. Without them, any individual could watch all of our transactions using the blockchain. 
 being said, using one may be illegal depending on the country you live in so use them at your own discretion.
Edit: Darkwallet is working on making a decentralized service. Both the above listed mixers are centralized services, meaning that you have to trust them not to be malicious or keep logs. That being said, both have been around for quite some time and have developed positive reputations in the community.

Oh ok, thats what I thought you were referring to.
Agreed. Unfortunately until the ecosystem matures there is no good solution for people who do not have advanced computer skills, but we aim to provide the next best thing. 
To call a properly setup offline version of bitaddress.org "the worst possible way to store bitcoins" is disingenuous. Our guide is for beginners, we don't expect them to run linux and deal with traditional computer threats. Not to mention your alternative involves connecting that computer to the internet in order to sync the blockchain, that opens up a bunch of attack vectors, that many average users would be ill equipped to protect themselves from.
Thoughts on this:
Also, what are your thoughts on the [piper wallet]( printer?
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:49:43
No, im saying it's all a balance. Every user should weigh their options when it comes to securing their coins, and choose one with the right balance of security and convenience.
Coinbase offers a very secure and user friendly service. I'm not arguing against that. I'm saying that the idea that they can't access your coins because of this multisig implementation is a false statement. They could still access your coins if they wanted to. You are trusting Coinbase when you store coins with them. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:05:59
Right.  Huobi has no fees. But they also have a reward structure for big players I believe.  Regardless, both no fee and maker taker structures encourage the use of trading bots.  These bots will give us increased liquidity and volume.  Huobi's meteoric volume rise is a perfect example of it.

Bitcoin has several advantages:
* It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). This eliminates the need to trust this third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.
* It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any fiat currency, or even gold.
* It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government or bank. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased, either by simply printing more (or doing the equivalent electronically), or through a process called fractional reserve banking. Find out more about this [here](
* Transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without his permission.
* It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. It is divisible to any extent, it is completely fungible (every bitcoin in indistinguishable from every other in value), it is portable as no non-cryptocurrency is, since it can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).
* It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself (once you follow some important security guidelines).
* It does not require identification of agents in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.

It just matters how much money you are storing and how safe you want it to be. If you are storing more than $100k, its well worth it to destroy the ~$200 PC you used to generate the paper wallets. That's only a .2% one time cost to protect $100k.

Just to clarify for everyone else, it's not that blockchain.info's 2FA is fake it is just that it doesn't protect your backups. This is by design, just in case the site goes down, you can still access your funds.
That being said, BC.I has been pretty unreliable lately. If I were you, I'd switch to a web wallet competitor such as greenaddress.it or a mobile wallet such as mycelium or breadwallet.
Long term savings should be kept in cold storage.

 Use an old computer that you WILL NEVER connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets. 
You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  OFFLINE(it should never be connected to the internet again. )  If you enable bip38, you get additional protection in the form of a password.  That means that someone will need to physically access your paper wallet as well as know your password to steal your coins. 
You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print outs.  Bip38 helps protect against malicious printers because the paper wallet doesn't have your password on it.  That being said, you are still best off using a dedicated printer with no memory or internet connection.  It really just matters how much money you are storing and how safe you want to be.
Alternatively you can buy  which is a turn key solution for paper wallet generation. Essentially it's a purpose built computer/printer that never connects to the Internet. You just press a button and a new wallet is generated and printed.

Mycelium has a feature in the works that uses network propagation to allow merchants to accept no confirm transactions with high probabilities of being confirmed.
Edit: On another note, it seems that for small transactions the only way for someone to execute an affordable double spend attack is to not include a fee with their transaction.  Blockchain should add a feature that tells the merchant whether or not a fee was attached to the transaction for this reason.

The use of bitcoin as a store of value/wealth is not spoken about enough imo. It has the potential to be the most secure/easy store of wealth that the average person has ever had available to them. If anything, the ability to store large amounts of wealth securely and without a third party such as a bank or country is bitcoin's killer app. 
Bitcoin goes above that even, since it doesn't only enable you to easily secure your wealth but also to easily transfer that wealth to others.

Bitshares were originally distributed to owners of protoshares. But Protoshares itself was basically a preorder coin for Bitshares. So that isn't really an advantage, or a disadvantage, it's the same as other proof of stake coins in that early adopters will be able to maintain their large slice of the pie, because they get rewarded for the more coins they get.
That's always been my main issue with POS in general. The concept that those with more coins will receive more coins than those with less, just seems fundamentally flawed.
Edit: Also, for those that don't quite understand what DPOS is:
Edit I'm not saying DPOS isn't awesome, because it seems really cool. Just wouldn't rush to say it's a Bitcoin killer. Bitcoin is robust and simple. I forsee a future where Bitcoin is used for large transactions and as a store of value, while more nimble coins will be used for specific niches such as high transaction times or low power usage. 
Edit3: Also shouldn't be too difficult for Bitcoin to switch to DPOS if need be. All you would have to do is take a snapshot of Bitcoin addresses and build a derivative DPOS coin off of that. Those who want to switch could then switch, while those who don't could stick with the POW coin.

The reason there is a delay between bank transfer and receiving your bitcoin is because bitcoin transactions are irreversible so there is a fraud risk.

People are watching piper's code as well,  or you can audit it yourself. Open source, open hardware (it's a rasberry PI). Audit it yourself, and open the box up and take a look.
Also for what its worth, there hasn't been one case where funds were stolen using an exploit in a piperwallet. Sure, they could slip some sort of an exploit in there, but their business model relies on a strong reputation and even one exploit discovered would destroy their business. 
Also,  since you never connect it to the internet,  the only people who would be able to steal your funds, if there was in fact an exploit, would be the piperwallet guys themselves compared to the multiple attack vectors on blockchain.info. The two products are completely different and serve completely different purposes.

To elaborate on the comment by , What problems does bitcoin solve:
* It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). This eliminates the need to trust this third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.
* It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any fiat currency, or even gold.
* It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government or bank. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased, either by simply printing more (or doing the equivalent electronically), or through a process called fractional reserve banking. Find out more about this [here](
* Transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without his permission.
* It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. It is divisible to any extent, it is completely fungible (every bitcoin in indistinguishable from every other in value), it is portable as no non-cryptocurrency is, since it can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).
* It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself (once you follow some important security guidelines).
* It does not require identification of agents in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.

Dude they tell you that its all client side encryption,  but you have to take their word for it because its closed source.  If they want to install a backdoor into the iOS app for instance, you would never know if they siphoned off your master encryption password and kept it in a database.
Edit: Look at what they tried to do to lava bit.  All of their encryption happened client side but they wanted the owner to install a backdoor in the software to collect the encryption keys.  They even gave him a gag order so he couldn't tell anyone.  He chose to close up shop.  You have to trust that lastpass has the same amount of integrity when you use their product.

Its worth noting that these miners don't have many altcoin options.  Most major altcoins, except for peer coin, use scrypt instead of sha in order to prevent 51% attacks from bitcoin miners.  That means that current bitcoin asics can't mine any of the scrypt coins.  They either mine bitcoin or don't mine anything. 
Just as it has in the past, the price needs to continue to go up for mining to be profitable if the hashing rate keeps going up.

Creating properly generated paper wallets is not as difficult as it seems. We wrote a really simple and comprehensive guide below:
Alternatively, if you want really simple cold storage, you should check out the Piper Wallet Printer. It is a purpose built computer/printer combo that never connects to the internet and prints paper wallets for you. You can make the BIP38 password protected for additional protection. Its only $199, if you are storing a lot of BTC, it is completely worth it.
Edit(Link to Piper Wallet): 
We definitely need easier ways to store BTC but handing over complete control of your private key is the worst way of doing that. Multi SIG innovations will help a lot in that regard. I'd rather use something like greenaddress.it than circle.com for storage, because of the multi SIG.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:23:37

You will probably never get a ROI on this.  If you do, it would be because the price/btc goes up a lot and in that case you would have been better off just buying btc on an exchange.
The only reason to use a service like this is to easily help contribute to the resiliency of the network.

First you need an android phone or a jail broken iPhone. I recommend the Nexus 5 or moto G.  Both are full featured and can be purchased off contract for relatively cheap.
Then download Mycelium.  It is a full featured android wallet.  It will generate a bitcoin address for you.  Go onto coinbase and send your coins to that address.  Now your coins will be in Mycelium. 
To spend your coins, you just need to scan the merchants qr code using Mycelium.  This copies the merchants bitcoin address into your phone without you needing to type it out.  
Mycelium is designed really well and you should be able to figure it out but if you have any more questions feel free to reply to this post.

True, but if it's on a VPS then it's not as risky. If it's not on a VPS, it's extremely easy to setup using GUI for novice users. Just install bitcoin core and forward port 8333 if necessary.

For the time being, Mycelium Local Trader is a nice option. It isn't purely decentralized but unlike Localbitcoins, they don't store any of your coins for you.  This reduces the risk of them being hacked/foul play, and you losing all your coins. Also it means that if Mycelium's servers go down, you can still access your coins and move them to a safer address. 
Each Mycelium seller account is attached to a Bitcoin address, which is stored on a user's cellphone.  The seller can only list coins for sale if he has that much Bitcoin in the connected Bitcoin address.  Then when a buyer agrees to meet a seller's price, an encrypted chat is launched that allows them to iron out any details and establish a place to meet.  The buyer and seller meet in person,   and when the sale is finalized, the Bitcoin are transferred directly from Seller's address to buyer's address without Mycelium ever storing the coin's themselves.

Use a computer that you will never connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets.   You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  offline.   You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print  outs. 
Alternatively you can buy  which is a turn key solution for paper wallet generation. Essentially it's a purpose built computer/printer that never connects to the Internet. You just press a button and a new wallet is generated and printed.

True. When privacy/security is concerned, there is no perfect answer. It all depends on how important security is to you, how technically proficient you are, and how much convenience you are willing to sacrifice.
Ideally you should run as much as possible locally. 
If you can't do that, then it would be best to use decentralized open source applications with properly implemented end-to-end encryption (ex: think maidsafe, storj and Tor). 
If you have to use a centralized service, it would be best to use one in a country with solid privacy protections/track record.

Seamlessly exchanging cash for btc and vice versa makes bitcoin much more useful. Imagine taking your cash, easily converting it into btc at a local atm, sending it to a buddy across the world,  and then he can go to a local atm to switch it to his local cash. It makes using bitcoin that much simpler.
The KYC/AML laws make it much less useful but there will always be countries that allow transactions without them. Also there will always be a blackmarket to trade cash for bitcoin that will be impossible for authorities to stamp out.

Gotcha.  How about on P2Pool?  Do miners run their own full nodes in that situation?
Edit: Found this in the comments of this thread by :

It's financially in the Miner's interest too, since they get a portion of the transaction fees and there are no pool fees. The only problem is a confusing setup and a not-perfect web-gui sponser some devs!

True, but Bitcoin is the technical solution to this civil liberties issue. 
 Bitcoin makes storing your wealth, without a third party (such as a bank), easier and more secure than ever before in human history. I watched this shitty movie the other night, and the main character was a criminal in the 60s and he was traveling all around Europe with thousands of dollars in US cash. Bitcoin makes this seem so antiquated but besides Bitcoin, the cash in suitcase method is really the only alternative. Crazy to think about.

If you buy the Piper Wallet, you literally just plug it in, put the paper in, and click the print button.
Obviously there are risks with every method, but at least with the methods I suggest, the risks are known and if you follow the directions you will be fine.
With Circle, they could just turn around tomorrow and say no you can't access your money. Whether that is due to govt regulation, bankruptcy, hacking, or just straight downtime. If you store your coins with Circle or Coinbase, you can lose them at any moment.
Ultimately, it is up to you to make the decision that is best for your situation. Just trying to help you make an informed decision.

Mining pool diversity is important in bitcoin because it prevents a few key individuals from having too much power.  That is why miners should choose smaller mining pools rather than the largest one. When you mine at home you can change your pool if the pool you use becomes too powerful.  But if you cloud mine you are stuck with the pool you bought the GH/S from.
  If you really want to cloud mine, knowing you won't make a profit, you should use a smaller operation to help keep diversity amongst mining pools.
I use Bit-Mining.co in order to support the network.  Their pool is tiny.  Less than 2% of the network compared to Ghash's 30%.  Any bitcoin I make with them automatically goes into purchasing more GH/S.  I know I can't make a profit so I'm using it as a way to contribute hashing power to the network in order to prevent centralization of the mining power amongst heavyweights like cex.io.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Edit: Graph of mining pools by % control of the hash rate :

Your second paragraph was spot on.  Do that.  Download bitaddress.org from github.  Run a live CD(preferably tails but Ubuntu works too) offline.  Then create bip38 encrypted paper wallets.  Then you can create PDFs of those and encrypt them with true crypt so you have digital copies.  That way you have double encryption on the digital versions and if you change the name to something inconspicuous that's a nice touch too.  If you want to be really secure, the computer you generate the paper wallets on should never be connected to the internet ever again.

They do have a point though. It makes it easier to compare their offering to CEX and other cloud mining providers. If you want to reinvest a percentage you can use your dividends to buy more shares. Then once demand for shares goes up and their existing loans paid out, they can issue votes to add more hashing power to their mine. Rinse and Repeat.
That being said. They need to give us an update on the P2Pool situation. The worst part is that they are mining with GHASH. If they can't switch to P2Pool, then they should at least switch to a different pool.

Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy. We are making a ton of progress everyday. The amount of things you can buy  with bitcoin has increased substantially when compared to this time last year.

Legally speaking, they are only supposed to be for accredited investors. These new exchanges are running quasi-legally. The only reason they are able to operate is because bitcoin allows the deposit and withdrawal of large amounts of funds without the government being able to block it.

1) Glad you feel comfortable with the fact that your government can seize all of your wealth at will. I personally am not comfortable with that. Everyday governments worldwide seize wealth, and its not always because the holder is a criminal. 
2)Merchants don't need your physical address for digital goods and services. VPNs, gambling, website design/coding just to name a few. On top of that, if it weren't for government regs, it would be trivial for someone to offer an anonymous mail receiving service. That is definitely something that could be decentralized in the future.
3) International payments using the traditional system is a huge source of friction. Many sites don't accept credit cards from certain countries due to high fraud rates. 
 Especially for digital goods. On top of that, international credit card fees are prohibitively high.
Paypal and competitors arent  available in many countries and they have to pay high USD conversion rates when it is offered.
4)The dollar has continually lost value and will continue to lose value. They keep printing money. That is a fact. A decentralized and deflationary digital currency can solve that. Bitcoin is the frontrunner. Its still up 300% year over year (You're not the only one who can pick and choose a date range to suit your purposes.).

Use an old computer that you WILL NEVER connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets. 
You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  OFFLINE(it should never be connected to the internet again. ) 
You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print outs.

Fantasy Football Commish Here.
My main league is a keeper league w/ yahoo that uses an auction draft system. Every team gets a set amount of virtual cash every season and they use it to bid on players in auction draft and on waivers throughout the season.  Yahoo never touches our money, I collect and distribute to winners, but its like the virtual cash has real value based on league dues ÷ amt of virtual cash. 
I don't quite get what the advantage of is to a system like this compared to the system that we use except if you are playing with strangers. Then it makes a lot of sense.
Regardless, this kind of concept is perfect for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. I definitely suggest integrating it. Bitcoin makes online monetary transactions seamless and you don't have to deal w/ 3rd parties.

The beauty of bitcoin is that there are many different ways you can store it and its up to the individual to pick a method that suits their situation best.  I think as far as cold storage is concerned, paper wallets are the easiest option.
1. Buy a New [computer] ( that you will never connect to the internet
2. On a different computer, download source of [Bitaddress.org]( from Github
3. Transfer that zip file to the new computer with a USB thumbdrive
4. Extract the zip and run the html file to generate password protected BIP38 paperwallets
5. Print wallets from offline printer.

Exactly.  One of the beauties of bitcoin is you can safely store large amounts of money yourself and transfer it instantly.  There is no excuse for keeping more money than you're willing to lose on an exchange or anywhere else where you don't control the private keys.  If you need to use an exchange, just transfer the coins into the exchange an hour before you want to trade. 
In this particular case, keeping any coins on mt gox was even dumber because the writing has been on the wall for awhile now.  They were clearly mismanaged and people have had questions regarding their solvency since way back in the spring, when the US govt seized those bank accounts.  I have been calling their collapse for months now.  Its actually taken longer than  I originally expected.

The delay purchasing on coinbase is because they need to wait for the bank transfer to go through.
Let me know if you have any questions, I copy and paste this guide I made up every time someone asks about storing coins offline. Any coins you plan on holding for longer than a month should be stored this way. :
Use an old computer that you WILL NEVER connect to the Internet again to generate paper wallets. 
You need to download bitaddress.org's github repository.   It is the link at the bottom right of their Web page.  Then run the html file while the computer is  OFFLINE(it should never be connected to the internet again. )  If you enable bip38, you get additional protection in the form of a password.  That means that someone will need to physically access your paper wallet as well as know your password to steal your coins. 
You also need to make sure the printer you use doesn't connect to the Internet or have internal memory that stores print outs.  Bip38 helps protect against malicious printers because the paper wallet doesn't have your password on it.  That being said, you are still best off using a dedicated printer with no memory or internet connection.  It really just matters how much money you are storing and how safe you want to be.
Alternatively you can buy  which is a turn key solution for paper wallet generation. Essentially it's a purpose built computer/printer that never connects to the Internet. You just press a button and a new wallet is generated and printed.

The [Lavabit](  case shows us that American based companies most likely keep logs and give them to the US govt. 
If you care about your privacy, don't route all your sensitive internet traffic through a company located in America. 
Everyone should have a good VPN that is based outside of America and pro-privacy.
Some good options are  and 
Also, they both accept Bitcoin :-D
A decent free option:

They haven't tricked anyone, they just have zero trading fees. Since there are no trading fees, it becomes profitable for traders and bots to do a large number of trades for even the smallest amount of profit per trade. This naturally inflates volume numbers to levels that are way higher than exchanges that operate with trading fees. This helps them build marketshare but forces them to make money through other means, primarily by offering other services to customers. 
This is a legitimate business strategy, it's just different. Some new exchanges even go further by employing a maker/taker fee structure where high level clients receive negative trading fees in order to build marketshare and boost liquidity/volume on the exchange.

Coinbase offers a terrific service but its not fast. Unless you have instant setup and then you can buy up to 1k USD worth instantly each week. This is because of the legacy banking system being slow and Coinbase needs to protect themselves from fraud.
If speed is most important then you should use a decentralized cash exchange like Mycelium or LocalBitcoins.

There was a lot of talk on social media and IRC about what amounts losing bids were. Of course, you have to take those claims with a grain of salt, there is no way to prove whether or not they are telling the truth. Unless there is a Freedom of Information Request or some sort of forced disclosure in the future for a different reason, we will never know the price paid for sure. We are left with educated guesses and speculation. 
Part of the reason I put together this hub for this auction is because so many "sources" were essentially lost in the crowd in the last auction. For this auction, people in the future will be able to go back to this hub and see exactly how everything unfolded. 
I'm going to dig around and see what I can find in regards to bidders' disclosures in the last auction.

The Bitcoin Documentary, Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, has it's first public premiere tomorrow and is being released online on Oct. 10th.
With the help of Coinbase, Gravitas is thought to have recently paid over 500 BTC (over $200k USD) for the worldwide rights to the film. Learning from the failure of the previous producers, they have wasted no time, and have hit the ground running. Not only are they premiering it in Cleveland, New York, and Los Angeles this Friday, but they are making the film available for Bitcoin directly from their site, Bitcoindoc.com, starting on Oct. 10.

Still better than a whole financial system that is IOUs. Which is the only alternative to Bitcoin. Obviously it's not ideal to trust a third party, but  provides an awesome service that creates an incentive for decentralized infrastructure to roll out. (You can setup a  server with an extra android phone, providing locals with a way to connect with the network and you are automatically compensated... which is pretty fucking cool). 
This is just a stop gap solution. Long term, cheap smartphones are starting to roll out, and people will be able to use those to interface directly with the Bitcoin network.

No, those backup solutions only work with root.

Haven't had an issue using them with both bank account and credit card purchases. Although my CC did charge me a $20 cash advance fee, but that comes with the territory, and isn't Circle's fault.
Also, they need to have some kind of fraud plan in place, otherwise they will get killed with Credit Card fraud. Looks like you tripped it, but instead of reaching out to them you continued to try the same funding source over and over again. If it didn't work the first time, it won't work if you keep pressing buy lol. They just opened up operations, give them some time to iron the kinks out. 
As far as identification information is concerned, that is the fault of government and regulators. They force Circle to comply with Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer laws. I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't require any of those docs when I setup my account. Appears they only require them if you trip their auto fraud protection, which is a step above many other sites that require you to send in identification docs before buying anything.
Remember, this is the first time in the history of Bitcoin that you can use a legitimate VC backed American company to buy Bitcoin with Credit Card. That is a huge development.

For anyone else looking for a way to secure their funds on Coinbase better, the best answer is to move them off of Coinbase. A properly generated paper wallet is much more secure and provides additional benefits since you control your private keys yourself. This means that Coinbase or a government entity doesn't have the power to prevent you from accessing your funds.

Yup, exactly like you said. Your backup is as secure as your weakest password. You should also enable 2 factor authentication on your email for extra security. I know Gmail and Outlook support it.

Imagine a situation where you have 3 companies, and each company are the only approved full node/miners on the network. They can share a ledger and have all the transparency/security/interoperability that comes with it, with the caveat that each company needs to trust each other. But that's alright because it is in the business interests to act in the best interest of the joint partnership. If they do something malicious  it's breach of contract and makes their company look bad. At the same time,  they don't have to trust employees with access to the ledger system.

The major exchanges are on Gavins side.  He has already said that. 
This is not a story about a hard fork failure. It's a story about Cryptsy's constant incompetence.

Too bad, it was a pretty awesome tool. That being said, they had no monetization strategy, except maybe selling your trade history info, but that was probably prohibited in their agreement with Coinbase. So, maybe they got tired of Bitcoin and losing money, and closed up shop.

You are missing the point.  Bitcoin is decentralized money that we can hold ourselves instead of trusting third parties.  You can't do that in the current financial system without hoarding cash or gold.  
Bitcoin has several advantages:
* It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). This eliminates the need to trust this third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.
* It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any fiat currency, or even gold.
* It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government or bank. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased, either by simply printing more (or doing the equivalent electronically), or through a process called fractional reserve banking. Find out more about this [here](
* Transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without his permission.
* It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. It is divisible to any extent, it is completely fungible (every bitcoin in indistinguishable from every other in value), it is portable as no non-cryptocurrency is, since it can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).
* It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself (once you follow some important security guidelines).
* It does not require identification of agents in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.

Obviously depends on your jurisdiction. In America you'd be on very shaky grounds operating one but it's not yet clear how they will handle people who merely use them for block chain privacy.  Using one may trigger an IRS audit for instance but as long as you can prove you didn't use it to illegally avoid taxes you should be fine. I think we have to coordinate our education/outreach as a community to avoid the term "laundering" and make it clear that mixing services are required for financial privacy when using bitcoin. They are financial privacy tools.

My understanding is there are two situations:
1. Case holds a key. Your device holds a key. You hold a 3rd backup key.
2. Case holds a key. Your device holds a key. Third Key Solutions holds a key.
In either situation, if you lose your device or it gets stolen, you need Case's key to recover your funds but Case shouldn't be able to take your funds without third key solutions colluding with them. That being said, since it isn't open source, Case could theoretically use a backdoor to compromise your device key and therefore have the 2 of 3 keys necessary to take your funds.

Any bitcoin sent to any of those addresses can be retrieved with just the seed of 12 words you got in the beginning. You don't need to backup your private key every transaction.

Nope. Your existing private keys will correspond to coins on both block chains. There is no situation where you will lose access to your funds.
Edit: Unless the developer for your specific wallet app makes some kind of error. I guess the best situation to be in would be to have your coins stored using Bitcoin Core or a paper wallet before the fork so that you know you have direct access to your private keys. Or any other wallet that gives you direct access to your keys.
Edit2: Sites like coinbase and circle control your private keys. So if you have coins stored with them at the time of the fork, you will probably only have access to your set of coins that are on the block chain that coinbase/circle decides to go with.

That's what makes a decentralized block chain a block chain. There's plenty of room for semi-centralized block chains operated by companies in joint partnership. The key is that we shouldn't pretend that is nearly as revolutionary as a decentralized global block chain with permission-less access.

I wrote this up a week before they announced Apple Pay, still holds true to this day: 
**Copied here for convenience:**
The big news this week is that Apple is finally getting into [mobile payments]( With the news, there has been a vocal opinion by many that this is [going to kill Bitcoin]( Hah!
Apple is late to the game, and now joining the likes of Paypal, Google, Venmo, Dwolla, Facebook, and Amazon in the highly competitive mobile payments space, none of which have “killed” Bitcoin yet. Despite what the media wants you to believe, this isn’t a major innovation by Apple, this is them playing catch up, implementing a feature that should have been a key aspect of the iPhone years ago. Yes, Apple is a heavyweight with tons of cash, great connections, and a loyal customer base, but Google, Paypal, Facebook, and Amazon aren’t exactly lightweights either.  
When it comes down to it, none of them are competing with Bitcoin, they are payments systems, not decentralized currencies. I’m the first one to admit it, services like Google Wallet are infinitely easier and better payment methods than Bitcoin. Using Google Wallet I can instantly send money with no fees, and Google protects me with consumer protection laws similar to credit cards. Google Wallet is awesome. That being said, it is not a competitor to Bitcoin: it is a closed system that enables you to transfer existing currencies. I could see a future where Google, Paypal, and Apple allow you to fund your account with Bitcoin, and then you can use their closed payment system for transfers. In this way, Apple wallet could work alongside Bitcoin, it isn’t necessarily one versus the other. With all that said, Apple’s system will most likely be even more of a closed system than the companies they plan to compete with. How useful is a payment system if you can only use it with Apple iPhones and iPads? All of Apple’s competitors allow you to use your choice of phone/device, so it should be interesting to see if Apple decides to continue their usual path of closing off their services to only Apple device users. 
In fact, the biggest change we will see as consumers is that NFC may finally take off, and that benefits everyone, especially Bitcoin users.  NFC is a low power communication tech that allows mobile payments and any type of data transmission by simply tapping your phone. Google has had NFC in its phones for years, believe it or not, I can walk into a Duane Reade and pay by just tapping my phone with zero fees, instantly, using Google Wallet on my Nexus 5. I can also tap my phone to someone elses phone, if they have NFC, and instantly transfer files, contacts, or Bitcoin. That being said, the usefulness of NFC has been limited because Apple hasn’t included it in an iPhone. Apple has single handidly held back adoption of this amazing technology in the United States, even though you can use it to pay for the subway in places like [South Korea]( With Apple wallet coming out, and NFC rumored to be included in the iPhone 6, we will begin to see NFC tech in more places than ever before. Here’s the big one: With the proper software, anywhere that has an NFC terminal or any phone that has NFC built in, can easilly accept Bitcoin payments without QR codes, just a quick tap of your phone and the Bitcoin payment is sent.
Apple Wallet and Bitcoin are completely different. One is merely a payment system, while the other is a decentralized and deflationary digital currency that anyone can build apps with. 
 has several advantages:
+ It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). 
 + This eliminates the need to trust any third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.
+ It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any traditional currency, or even gold.
+ It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased.  
 + The Federal Reserve of the United States prints more US Dollars everyday, this means the spending power of the dollar in your pocket goes down every time another dollar is printed.  
 + Bitcoin on the other hand has a finite supply just like gold, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin.
+ Similar to cash, transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without the merchant initiating the transaction.  
 + Credit Card charge backs can be reversed up to a month after the transaction. 
 + Same with PayPal.
+ It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. 
 + It is divisible to any unit size: each bitcoin is made up of 100 million Satoshis for instance
 + It is completely fungible: every bitcoin is indistinguishable from every other in value)
 + It is completely portable: funds are stored in the cloud (the blockchain)
     +  It can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).
     +  You are currently not allowed to travel out of America with more than $10,000 without declaring it to customs.  With bitcoin you can travel with millions of dollars and customs would be none the wiser. 
+ It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself ([once you follow some important security guidelines](
 + Some people will choose to still use banks for security and ease of use but at least they have the option not to.
+ Just like cash, it does not require identification of individuals in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.
  +  When [Target]( was hacked, anyone who had used a credit or debit card there was at risk. 
 + When you pay with bitcoin, the merchant only sees your public key so even if their system is compromised, a hacker can’t take any of your funds.  You no longer have to trust the merchant.
+ Proof of Payment
 + All transactions are recorded in the blockchain so you have hard proof that you paid someone and when the payment went through.

I haven't come across a single iOS wallet that works with a 4. There's some kind of limitation. I'm an android guy so I'm not positive what it is, but I tested a bunch out with my mom's iphone4 a month or so ago and couldn't get anything to work.
My guess would be that maybe the coinbase app works, just because they do all the heavy lifting on their web servers, but you would have to check because I'm not positive.

Thanks for the source, but I think that single line is just a token handout to the dissenters and they won't actually follow through with it. That's why they are putting it off to an "undetermined date." 
Who says 3MB is too dangerous? Majority of miners are fine with less than 8, and the occasional 3MB block isn't going to lead to many nodes going offline. Most blocks won't be full anyway because miners ultimately choose how many transactions to put in. I know I'd keep running my two nodes.

It definitely is a privacy concern. It links your IP to an interest in Bitcoin. It could also be a security concern for that reason. 
The best rule of Bitcoin security is to make sure as few people as possible even know you are interested. That's why a lot of people run them on VPS. 
I run mine on my home line and my office line. I'm already in the public spotlight when it comes to Bitcoin because of  so I figure it doesnt add much of an additional privacy issue. I have good routers and practice "good computing" behavior. And most of all, I store the overwhelming majority of my bitcoin offline in cold storage.

I think for most companies and people, they are more comfortable with a US based entity holding their keys. If something happens, they feel more secure that they can rely on the US government and US regulatory bodies to go after the owners/operators of Third Key Solutions. In my case, after seeing what happened with Lavabit, I'd prefer an entity not based in America. Even going so far as avoiding companies based in countries that have strong relationships with America. 
Lastpass is a perfect example. Most people are perfectly comfortable (most even prefer) to have an American company running closed source code, holding all of their passwords. I would NEVER use Lastpass. 
Edit: If you haven't heard about what happened to Lavabit -

To answer your question on why the CCN guy is doing this?
In the end it's all about the $$$. With some outlets it is because they were/are accepting GAW Ad money, and with other sites it may be more nefarious than that, accepting cash behind the scenes for good press. 
Coindesk, NewsBTC, CCN and the Bitcoinist have all run a ton of GAW ads lately. To its credit, when wrongdoing became obvious, Coindesk pulled their GAW ads and wrote a pretty good piece on the scandal: 
Bitcoinist, NewsBTC, and CCN all still run ads for GAW. NewsBTC ads are the worst in my opinion because they are huge and look like an endorsement. They also say that Paybase is compatible with Amazon, Walmart, and Target which is just plain false. 
This isn't just a problem with bitcoin news but with all ad supported news in general. It is just highlighted even more in our community since there are tons of scams and altcoin pump and dumps for malicious actors to take advantage of. 
My current project [CoinPrices.io]( is completely ad free. We solely run on tips/donations. Thats means we work for you, not advertisers. 
We've been warning our users to tread carefully regarding Paycoin and GAW for months. Our Paycoin Hub is constantly updated and can be found here:

Whenever possible we link to the original source and we do not post duplicate articles on the same topic from multiple sources. That reduces clutter and allows you to sort through all the BS.

From the article I linked: 
" Oxfam made headlines at Davos last year with a study showing that the 85 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 50% (3.5 billion people). The charity said this year that the comparison was now even more stark, with just 80 people owning the same amount of wealth as more than 3.5 billion people, down from 388 in 2010." 
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:45:57
And it appears it pays a fee of. 0001 btc for every transaction. Each transaction totals .0002 btc. That's a 50% fee per transaction. They should use an altcoin with less fees or just group transactions in batches like changetip does.

But this is for people like my dad who has horrible password behavior and computer skills. He is better off trusting someone else to hold and protect his coins than himself.

No computer skills required.

Roger Ver is the rumored owner of bitcoin.com. Roger Ver is also a main partner at Blockchain.info.  
Pure Speculation:
After Blockchain.info had all this recent bad publicity over the insecure generation of addresses, the bc.i team chose to lay low for a bit. At that point, bitcoin.com pointed to all of their services. Maybe they made a quick deal with OkCoin that OKC would have control of bitcoin.com until they want it back. Also probably gives bc.i a nice bit of extra revenue during a downtrend in bitcoin price.

Yup but it won't go down in value consistently, which is what happens with fiat currency. Constant loss of purchasing power over time. 
Even if bitcoin stays flat to slight up once it matures, it's still a huge step up from traditional fiat money when it comes to storing wealth.

After the hard fork, there would be two block chains, let's call them bitcoin1 and bitcoin2.
If you had 20 bitcoin before the hard fork, you will have 20 bitcoin1 and 20 bitcoin2 after the hard fork. Then the free market will decide whether bitcoin1 or bitcoin2 are more valuable. People will be able to trade between bitcoin1 and bitcoin2 just like people currently trade between bitcoin and altcoins and ultimately the market will decide which network is worth more and is the "winner". In this way, the hard fork is a rough but robust way to vote on changes to the network in a free market way. I have a feeling we will have multiple hard forks going forward as new changes are added to the protocol.

I agree with you but to play devil's advocate the main argument against a block size increase are reduced fees paid to miners. 
If space in a block is limited, then users will be forced to pay miners higher fees to be included in blocks. 
Edit: Just to be clear, I want to reiterate that I'm playing devil's advocate here. 
My thoughts on the subject on the record: 
1/ The idea that a hard-fork is impossible to agree on is false.  Just needs to be planned far enough in future to prevent issues. 
2/ As long as the main exchanges move to the new fork. All miners would be forced to switch or will have no way to cash out.  
--- 
4/ A hard-fork is a brilliant yet rough voting method. Two "coins" will emerge, &amp; the one the market likes better wins.

It's because cheaper server providers don't provide the API hooks necessary to automate the whole process. IIRC the creator of fullnode is using multiple providers chosen at random but can only use providers with API access which limits his choices. If you find cheaper server providers that have API access you should let him know. (or let me know and I'll let him know)
His name is Or Weinberger.
Edit: FWIW I run two full nodes personally. One from my apartment and one from my office on always-on computers. That is definitely the most affordable way to do it because I just use the bandwidth I'm already paying for. Price conscious bitcoiners who still want to help the network should really go that route.

I edited my original post with this:
I haven't been able to find Karpeles on the record ever talking about Willy bot. I think the explanation I pulled from above was based on private conversations with him that we heard secondhand as a community. Regardless, the whole Willy Bot scenario is speculation on both sides. We don't even know if the leaked Mt. Gox trade data wasn't tampered with before being released by the hackers. Furthermore, the author of the Willy Report has remained anonymous to this day and his/her motives remain unclear. Lots of people made lots of money correctly betting on the price dropping so severely this year.
Also the fact that fiat withdrawals were heavily delayed throughout late 2013 and early 2014 meant that many Gox traders bought bitcoin at a higher price than they would in order to withdraw it off the exchange quicker than fiat withdrawals (or to trade it for non trapped bitcoin on bitcoinbuilders.com all the way up to the end). That also forced the price up a ton.  
The good news is that now that we have much more competition in the exchange market it is way more difficult(if not impossible) for one exchange to manipulate the price.

I feel like this article lets Karpeles off the hook way too much. The majority of coins were stolen before 2013, if Mark wasn't maliciously involved in the thefts, he was definitely complicit in the fraudulent cover up of those thefts over the following years.

Mt Gox was most likely insolvent before the silk road bust in Oct 13. For those in the community at the time, the writing was on the wall for months before hand. Withdrawals were delayed for weeks if not months at points, accounts were being locked for not being verified, and Karpeles kept making false promises. The US govt even seized 5M USD from Gox bank accounts in April '13.
Also people put too much credit on the Willy Bot for the price increase. The bot was not buying up that many coins and it was probably exactly what Mark said it was. A way for VIP customers to buy large amounts of bitcoin without opening an account. 
I remember back in August '13. "LTC is going to spike in 2 weeks when Mt gox adds support for it when they roll out their new trading engine"

That's why these long price downturns are important. It redistributes bitcoin from those who own a lot to those who are new investors.

Let us know if you have any other questions. Every node helps the network become stronger and more robust.

If we bow to the wishes of a select few people because of their threat of leaving then the project has already failed.
Edit: They are starting to sound like Hearn. He threatened to leave if he didn't get his way. Good riddance. We need people who can compromise and stash their ego.
Edit 2: One of the main governing mechanisms of Bitcoin is supposed to be the hard fork, otherwise it can be hijacked by a select few. Nobody is infallible, the hard fork possibility is an important check on their power.
Edit 3: Maxwell said he's not against a hard fork to a new algo if miners switch to Classic. So he's fine with people checking the power of the miners with a threat of a hard fork but when people check his power with the threat of one we are evil...

DASH already does this, same with Monero, and they both are currently functioning and operating in the real world. We don't need a new anonymous/privacy centric altcoin. What we need is built-in anonymity/privacy features in Bitcoin.
If they are still adamant about pushing this new coin, they should keep the same genesis block and coin ownership as Bitcoin so every bitcoin owner is already invested in their ecosystem.

Should be fine as long as you push your transactions through an intermediary wallet. Gives both you and Coinbase plausible deniability. 
If you want more privacy, you will need to either use a mixer or mixing techniques using anonymous exchanges, that will make it pretty much impossible to link your transactions on the block chain if you do it properly.
Remember, don't use these tools for illegal things. Follow your local laws. These are legitimate financial privacy tools and techniques that I am recommending.

1. SegWit on core does not lead to 80% of the capacity as Classic, because Classic(or another fork) will include both a block size bump and SegWit. Full SegWit at that because they would probably do it with a hard fork not a soft fork.
2. They aren't offering the same thing. Classic is offering an immediate 2MB bump plus SegWit in the future. Also the potential of future hard forks for improvements and a less toxic atmosphere that is more welcoming/open to different ideas.
3. Greg's comments definitely were blown out of proportion but we both know what he meant. If the miners don't fall in line behind the devs, he considers it an option to hard fork and change the POW. At the same time, he has stated that a hard fork by people who disagree with him is an altcoin and traitorous. Personally, if the majority of miners do move to classic, I'd support Core switching the POW. Then people can vote with their wallets which is more valuable. Competition is good.
4. Bitcoin will have many hard forks in the future. That's how the system upgrades itself, and people will essentially vote with their wallet which to support. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be controlled by a small group of people. 
5. If it has the same Genesis block and coin ownership as prefork, it is NOT an altcoin.

This idea that we will lose most of the developers if we fork to Classic is mostly just a bluff. I think that some devs may drop out but most will continue to work on the new fork. 
It is a classic bluff where someone gets angry and says "if you don't do it my way, then I'm leaving" but when the dust clears the person ends up staying. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:11:07
Well, Classic could use a different POW algo but keep the same Genesis block and coin ownership as pre-fork.
Edit: Lol at the downvotes. I guess it's alright when Maxwell threatens to change the POW because the miner's don't agree with him but if Classic does it then it's fucked up. A fork using a different POW is actually much cleaner than sticking with SHA256.

Also part of the reason is that altcoin supporters are running with the story as well to pump their own investments. Specifically Ethereum.

Monero is cryptonote. DASH is a two tier system with masternodes that provide mixing services. Neither are based on zerocoin. That being said, both provide sufficient privacy and anonymity benefits and are currently working in the real world.

That's what I was thinking too. Think about the subsidized phone model. The end user thinks they are getting a free phone but they end up spending way more than that on the 2 year contract.
For example, if a user can get a toaster with a 21 chip in it for half the price of a regular toaster, and then pay more in electricity, it will "trick" the uneducated consumer into thinking they are getting a better deal. A lot of people would go for that. People like quick savings even if it doesn't make sense in the long run.

Even at our most recent transaction spike, it hasn't been necessary to do more than 220 sat/byte to get into the next block. So even if he is being conservative, setting his transaction at 300 sat/byte would guarantee next block.
So either the person who sent that transaction was incompetent or is attempting to push network fees higher.

If you are holding more than 10 BTC, that really isn't too much for peace of mind. Bitcoin technology enables an individual to store their wealth easier and more securely than ever before, without needing to trust banks or other third parties.
Just remember, if you take your chance with Circle or Coinbase, they can lock you out at any moment. 
Personally, I live in NY. When the Bitlicense gets instituted, Circle and Coinbase will most likely cut access to NY based account holders. This is not an imaginary situation; any New Yorker who keeps coins on Circle and Coinbase as the Bitlicense draws closer is taking an additional unnecessary risk.

Right now GBTC is at a premium because it's the only way for Americans to get exposure to Bitcoin through their traditional brokerage accounts. Furthermore, it's the only way to trade bitcoin using a 401k/retirement account. If the COIN etf (or similar) gets approved, then those same people can trade COIN instead of GBTC. COIN, as a true etf, will be able to buy and sell bitcoin to keep its price in line with the actual bitcoin price. So there should be substantially less premium (if any) with COIN. Which in turn, will drive the GBTC premium down to COIN levels due to regular market forces.

Bitcoin actually is a great tool for people living in countries with corrupt/oppressive governments. 
Transparency of the block chain is not an issue because there are tools/techniques that allow you to use bitcoin anonymously if you know what you are doing.
Centralized mixing services are a stop gap solution while more decentralized tools such as and  are developed. There could also be some interesting anonymity applications run on side chains, but only time will tell.
For now, centralized solutions do provide an effective means of thwarting block chain analysis with a little time and $$. The use of Tor with the services is a good idea as well.

You don't need a phone to use CASE. The whole point of Case is that it is a standalone product with it's own 2G internet connection (like Kindles). When you buy the product you pay for lifetime internet included in the price. The picture is showing someone using CASE to pay an address shown on someone elses phone. CASE has it's own screen, internet, and camera so it is the first hardware wallet that you can walk around with and pay people easily in bitcoin without a computer or a phone.

Keep in mind that in that situation the Core Devs could implement BIP 101 directly into Core. Then both Core and XT will be running the same network with bigger blocks.

One of the coolest aspects of Bitcoin is that holders of Bitcoin are inherently incentivized to promote adoption. If adoption goes up, their bitcoin is worth more. 
Edit: Lol guys, this incentivization is a fact. I'm not saying people should shill or push bitcoin on new users. One positive thing they can do is build new tools and companies that make Bitcoin more useful. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:14:17
Oh, I thought you meant citizens of those countries wouldn't adopt it because of transparency.
I agree with you then. One of a government's main powers is control over wealth and the monetary supply of their people. Bitcoin usage removes/lessens this power so it makes sense that governments wouldn't choose to adopt it. That being said, people don't need their governments permission to start using it.

Microsoft is actually in a pretty great position to create  a semi-centralized altcoin.
Hear me out: 
They already have a huge customer base who runs their hardware (xbox one) in an always on Internet connected state. They could come out with a new coin that is specially designed to be mined well on xboxs, and then allow customers to mine it when their xbox is on but not being used.
They will probably never do this, but that would be really cool.

How do you decide how much interest each bitcoin holder gets? I thought you meant interest is paid out based on age of holdings.
Edit: This seems like kind of a more complicated version of just having small supply inflation. If they pay out any new coins to miners, then current coin holders will receive less than is being created, resulting in their value going down. If miners don't get paid any of the new coins, then there is no point to do it in the first place.
Nobody holding bitcoin will support this, because it will lose them money.
@_date: 2015-08-01 06:57:43
Usually in these situations bitcoin is introduced by an underdog, not the top player in an industry. 
Overstock and rakuten started accepting not Amazon.
Dish started accepting not directv.
Movietickets started accepting before moviefone and fandango.
Basically, we should try for Google music, tidal or one of the other underdogs to accept bitcoin. 
Alternatively,  maybe apple music will make Spotify the underdog and they will end up accepting bitcoin.

Sharedcoin has proved ineffective when compared to other solutions. Especially since bc.i knows a lot about it's customers as a centralized entity.
The alternative is to use an independent mixing service and a separate wallet. is a decentralized tool currently in development and seems promising. For now, there are centralized services that can be highly effective, especially when you use it in combination with Tor.

Yes, P2P buying and selling bitcoin is illegal unless the seller has a BitLicense (which would never happen because it costs too much for an individual to apply).
However, it is completely legal for a New Yorker to trade on a BitLicense compliant exchange (such as Coinbase, Coinsetter, Bitstamp, itBit). They just need to provide ID info to the exchange for KYC/AML compliance.

This seems like a pretty cool product. That being said, regular bitcoin as an asset is also very beneficial to Muslims.

Exactly, people are acting like Gemini will be revolutionary. Don't get me wrong, the more exchanges the better, but Coinbase Exchange is already an extremely credible NY Stock Exchange backed American based exchange and fully operating.

Interesting idea. Then it wouldn't be a deflationary or inflationary currency. It would be kind of a combination of both. Main issue I can think of off the top of my head is that if it relies on "days destroyed" then it will encourage the over usage of single addresses which presents a privacy and security issue.

You can use services such as  to peg your bitcoin to other assets/currencies. Alternatively you can use a service like  to convert to altcoins such as tether, bitusd and nubits that are pegged to traditional currencies. 
Ideally more hedging services/pegged altcoins will be developed as adoption increases. 
Edit: I also believe that bitcoin price will trend up in the long term. As adoption increases,  so should price, but these other options allow people to hedge the volatility risk to a level they desire.

Thanks for the good words and the tip. I read everything that your team posts, lots of quality content. Have a lot of respect for 's work in particular. He has always written quality work since before he started with you guys and continues to do so.
I completely understand the need for ads in order to generate revenue. You just need to be responsible for which ads you do allow to run on the site, because there are so many scams in our industry. I have yet to see an irresponsible ad on your site. Sponsored/paid content is much worse in my opinion, because it intentionally misleads users. Keep up the good work, and I agree that a rebrand is in order since the name/domain is kind of confusing currently. 
On a different but related note, we are thinking about creating a membership tier instead of purely relying on donations. Pure donation based revenue seems great in theory but few people ever donate. That being said, I feel like the incentives are aligned better when a news source makes money from their users rather than advertisers. We just need to find the right balance.
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:06:13

Card networks are indeed still operating and some large retailers have continued to accept domestic greek cards as payment but at the same time many have not, especially smaller retailers and landlords. 
Why would a person accept a debit card for a real good or service they own when they aren't sure if they will ever be able to access those funds. 
*A simple example is if you are a shop owner and you sold a carton of milk for 5 Euro to someone with a Greek debit card. You now no longer have the milk, don't know when banks will re-open, and don't know if some of the funds in your bank account will be used for a "bail-in." You also now have to hope that your supplier will be willing to accept your debit card when it comes time to buy more milk. Many suppliers and farmers are not accepting greek debit cards at the moment. In this scenario, cash is way more desirable.* 
Smart small merchants/landlords are not accepting Greek debit cards because it is just not worth it. I am a landlord in NYC, and if this was happening to me in Greece, I would rather keep a ledger system myself of everyone's past due rent than accept transfers into a bank account that I can't withdraw from. There is still a very good chance that even with this current ECB bail-out being agreed to, there could still be a "bail-in" where portions of bank accounts are confiscated.
TL;DR: I simplified a complex issue instead of diving deep into the complexities of merchants accepting cards on a case by case basis. Most wealth stored in Greek banks is currently inaccessible. If it were so easy to use debit cards everywhere, then there wouldn't be lines at the ATMs.

Soledad Rodríguez Pons admits she had no idea what bitcoin was when it was suggested to her two years ago that the digital currency could provide a neat way of dodging Argentina’s strict capital controls.
“I was suspicious at first,” says the 29-year-old owner of a budget hostel in Buenos Aires.

“But I took the risk, and it was well worth it,” she adds, explaining that she takes credit-card payments from foreign tourists in return for the digital currency. At the moment, she can sell her bitcoins on Argentina’s unofficial currency market for 50 per cent more than she would get at the official exchange rate.
The prolonged use of capital controls in Argentina since 2011 has wreaked havoc for businesses operating in South America’s second-largest economy — not only restricting access to foreign currency and leading to a heavily overvalued official exchange rate, but also exacerbating economic stagnation and double-digit inflation.
Under the leftist government of President Cristina Fernández, no immediate change is expected in Argentina’s complicated economic conditions, which have seen the use of bitcoin more than double over the past year, mainly among small businesses. This represents much faster growth than elsewhere in Latin America, according to bitex.la, a regional bitcoin exchange.
Recent raids on currency trading houses and new powers for the national spy agency to prevent speculative attacks pushed the peso’s black market value this week to its lowest levels since Argentina defaulted last year on its foreign debt for the second time this century.
Greek woe brings powerful sense of déjà vu for Argentina
Health and hospital workers advance towards Buenos Aires' Plaza de Mayo during a protest by various workers unions 29 August 2001
On a cruise round the Mediterranean, Domingo Cavallo, Argentina’s economy minister in the run-up to the country’s dramatic economic collapse in 2001, was bemused when he was unable to use his credit card during a brief stop-off on Greek soil last week.

However, presidential elections in October are expected to bring in a more market-friendly administration, and investors hope that untangling capital controls will be one of the top priorities for the new government. That has triggered a heated debate over how to defuse a situation that has caused an investment drought in Argentina.
“As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place,” says José Luis Espert, an Argentine economist.
The two leading candidates advocate sharply differing methods. Daniel Scioli, the one-armed governor of Buenos Aires province backed by Ms Fernández, favours a more gradual approach, although there is growing concern that his government ties will limit his room for manoeuvre.
Mauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, backed by the markets, prefers a more immediate solution.
Although Mr Espert also recommends a swift removal of capital controls, he says it must be accompanied by a “technically solid economic plan” that inspires strong confidence in the markets. “Without a credible plan, shock treatment can be just as damaging as a more gradual approach,” he warns.
José Urtubey, vice-president of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), a powerful business chamber, doubts that shock therapy will work. Although capital controls played a big part in a 2.6 per cent contraction in Argentina’s industrial sector last year — foreign currency is essential to import materials needed for industrial production — he fears that central bank reserves could not withstand the pressure on the currency generated by the controls’ sudden removal. “The remedy could be worse than the illness,” he says.
As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place
- José Luis Espert, Argentine economist
Such resistance to change explains why Mr Espert believes that Argentina’s volatile economy has for the past half century been stuck in a “vicious triangle”, whose vertices are crisis, followed by a rebound and then mediocrity — which every decade or so leads to another crisis.
“Soon there will be another one,” he says, pointing to a lack of consensus over how to fix the country’s serious macroeconomic imbalances, especially a gaping fiscal deficit, which he fears will lead to more mediocrity. “Argentina finds it very difficult to escape that triangle. We are afflicted by a kind of [economic] Stockholm syndrome,” he says.
If the future of Argentina’s economy is as gloomy as Mr Espert fears, that would be good news for bitcoin, which is still in its infancy in Argentina, with only about 6,000-8,000 users.
Franco Daniel Amati, a co-founder of Bitcoin Argentina, a kind of embassy for bitcoin in the heart of the Buenos Aires financial district, is optimistic about prospects for the digital currency in a country where still only half the population entrust their money to the formal banking system.
“A recurring inflation crisis, capital controls and overall financial repression make life very difficult in Argentina. More and more people here are looking for ways to get around these problems, and bitcoin is the perfect solution,” he says.

1) Users should definitely be able to comment. It will be a great spot for discussion that doesn't clutter the actual mailing list.
2) Users should not be able to post. Moderators should do the posting in order to keep it clear of clutter.
3) Upvoting/Downvoting should be allowed. It will help people sort through "what is important/interesting." Users can always choose to sort by date if they wish.
4) Users could choose different flair to show what BIP they want to see implemented the soonest. Also flair to show which bitcoin businesses they may operate or work for. This will allow users to see how industry players feel about the topics on the devlist. 
5) Yes, and I'd be happy to join your moderator team. I currently own and operate  and I have an extensive reddit history on this subreddit. PM me.

They were very pro-bitcoin but then the "Bitcoin Bank" Neo and Bee imploded in a scandal. That really hurt Bitcoin reputation there.
Also, Greeks aren't buying much bitcoin because it is extremely hard for them to get it with the capital controls in place.  However, people in countries with similar economic issues to Greece are becoming aware that it could happen to them. Those people in Spain/Italy/Puerto Rico etc. are the ones that will drive new adoption of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous, but can be used anonymously with available tools and a little time/money. 
For those concerned about maintaining their privacy, there are decentralized projects currently being worked on that will greatly enhance privacy when using Bitcoin. 
One of the most promising project is DarkWallet and it doesn't require any change in the Bitcoin protocol. DarkWallet is a donation based, open source, not for profit project so we should all help support them at  
Another promising project in development is For the mean time, there are centralized options that enable us to maintain our privacy when using Bitcoin. In the article below we discuss different methods used to protect Bitcoin users' financial privacy by thwarting block chain analysis.

Or etch the seed onto a piece of metal.
Or take a book on your bookshelf and highlight words in the order of your seed.
Be creative.
Edit: My point is that one of the most gamechanging aspects of Bitcoin is that you can store your funds anywhere that you can write/encode numbers and letters. Putting your backup in a safe is traditional thinking and is the first place someone trying to take your funds will look.

I agree. The beauty of Reddit is that it is a user moderated forum. I don't think there should be blacklists on reddit. 
On my site, the whole newsfeed is curated for quality so the news sites mentioned above do not make the cut. That being said, I read every post made on CCN, bitcoinist, and newsbtc even though we don't include them in the feed. If any of them started posting quality content and stopped their near fraudulent practices, that have lost their users countless sums of money, then we would start including them in our feed. Our priority is our users. Our mission is to keep them educated and up to date while navigating around scams, falsehoods, and pump and dumps.

You should also run a tor relay and seed the torrents for Bitcoin Core and tails. That's what I do on my nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:09:12
It's possible, but it is designed to be a simple out-of-the-box solution and it is preloaded with Core not XT.

Point your miner at a pool that supports the BIP you support.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:57:41
The difference is that neither XT and QT will have fresh new block chains, the beginning of each chain will be identical. This is completely different from "traditional altcoins" where they start with a completely new block chain.
I'm surprised there haven't been other attempts to "create a new coin" by cloning the Bitcoin block chain. A new alt that doesn't alienate current bitcoin holders (because they automatically have stake in it) could be quite successful.
I wrote more on this subject here: 
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:09:26
Agreed but it is still directly incentivized. It's just how assets with fixed supply work. The more people using and holding bitcoin, the higher the price will go.
Edit: And I'm not talking purely about "preaching" either. Building tools, products, and resources that bring more value and adoption to Bitcoin benefits anyone who is holding bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:54:12
One of the coolest aspects of Bitcoin is that anyone who holds bitcoin is incentivized to promote it and increase adoption.

Since it requires a password anyway, I could just email someone a bip38 encrypted private key and it would be pretty much the same thing. On top of that, it would work on all major wallets, not just your site. Also it would allow the user to check the balance without needing a password. 
Your site is definitely much more user friendly though. You should  just make it pure BIP38 so it works with the standard.

Miners sell their coins to pay for expenses such as electricity, labor and hardware. Currently approx. 3600 coins are mined per day. This adds sell pressure, pressure which will half when the Bitcoin halving occurs. Price is determined by supply and demand, if there is less supply and equal or more demand then price should increase.
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:27:56
More likely the latter.

Centralized mixing services are a stop gap solution while more decentralized tools such as and  are developed. There could also be some interesting anonymity applications run on side chains, but only time will tell.
For now, centralized solutions do provide an effective means of thwarting block chain analysis with a little time and $$. The use of Tor with the services is a good idea as well.

1) Not sure about Dooglus but that sounds like the model Stellar is choosing. They will take a snapshot of the Bitcoin block chain and reward current bitcoin holders a portion of Stellar. 
2) The reason you don't see it much is because most altcoin devs are looking for a quick $$ grab. Much easier to do a pump and dump if you control the original supply rather than current stakeholders.

As long as iOS is closed source, you have to trust Apple and your carriers not to do anything malicious behind the scenes. That's a major security issue if you plan to use it to store large amounts of coins.


The source code for Breadwallet is indeed open but there is no way to confirm that it is the same code you download from the app store. For this reason,  it has the same trust issues as closed source software.
Don't get me wrong. Breadwallet is a great app and I have never heard of anyone losing their coins using it. I would still not advise users to store large amounts of coins on an iOS device. The iOS/Breadwallet combo is a very secure and convenient hot wallet, but it is not an alternative to cold storage.

1) He's a statist. 
2) It gives him publicity/exposure.
I remember one piece he wrote where he said that Bitcoin can't work because when you receive bitcoin you don't necessarily receive "clear title," so somebody can come a long in the future and claim that your bitcoin is theirs.  That is a perfect example of seeing everything through a statist lens. We don't need the state to give us/transfer title, control of private keys means ownership.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:34:32
She means the miners who are securing the ledger are being paid in bitcoin. Whether or not you include fees in your transactions, they are still earning block rewards that are adding more bitcoin to the ecosystem, devaluing current bitcoin being held. So you are indirectly subsidizing them.

The fees are extremely insignificant compared to the block reward.
Because even if you have a full block at default fees, it only gets you $50 extra dollars and you run a higher risk of getting an orphan and losing the block reward.
TL:DR: $$
Edit: The current block reward is 25btc, which is roughly $6000. It's not worth it for them to risk $6000 for $15.

It is just for full nodes which host the block chain for the entire network. You can find out more here: 
Most users choose to use wallets that don't have a full copy of the block chain. Instead they get the block chain data from full nodes. Phone wallets for instance don't keep a local copy of the block chain.

He said he is basing it off his gut feeling...
"But some people say LN on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin? My gut feel is that this is not the case. Even with LN, Bitcoin still cannot service every person in the world. I think the calculation was that at 1MB blocks, LN and SegWit on Bitcoin can service 500M users. LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee. So Bitcoin LN txns will be more expensive than Litecoin LN txns. It may make economic sense for a LN txn to go via Litecoin and back to Bitcoin to get the cheapest rate. Lightning makes this possible because it allows the two LN to be interoperable. I don’t know that this use case will be economical or not, but we won’t know until both LNs are built and running."

FWIW There was an instamine glitch when it first launched. Anyone who was mining in the first 24 hours got more coins than they should. When that happened, there was no windows client(making it more difficult for regular users to run), so it was mostly just their core founding team that benefited from it. 
That being said, DASH has gone through multiple boom/bust cycles since launch so anyone who has wanted to get a substantial position has been able to purchase/mine them for relatively cheap. Also the major holders most likely sold much of their stake during the booms and busts. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:19:54
I can. But the cool thing about Tails' electrum integration is that it is built into the ISO. So you don't even need Tails' persistence feature enabled. You just boot into Tails, launch electrum, and write down your seed. Then you can boot Tails in the future, launch electrum, input the seed and have access to your wallet. When you're done, just pull the USB drive out and everything is wiped. It's pretty slick.

Yes, but you could encrypt the seed or the key before sending. I still wouldn't trust it for cold storage. Just adds an unnecessary  potential avenue for coin loss.
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:36:12

This isn't the protocols fault. There is no need to send 5% at a time. Just check the first few characters and last few characters of an address before sending. It's not that hard...
If anything, this shows how fee pressure will reduce unnecessary block chain bloat. People shouldn't be sending 20 transactions when they can just send one.

@_date: 2017-09-12 17:04:23
Now that we have segwit, trustless cross chain atomic swaps are possible. That will guarantee a minimal level of privacy since you can swap into other chains that offer anonymity at the protocol level. Segwit also improves privacy specific layer 2 services such as tumblebit. I think that is one of the main reasons for the opposition Segwit recieved. Is it perfect? No, but it is good enough for now and will get better over time.

@_date: 2017-09-12 17:21:32
Also, it is worth noting that from a purely technical perspective anonymity is better if it is on by default at the protocol level. That being said, Bitcoin does benefit from having transparent txs and balances. That's why I do not believe Monero and Bitcoin are competitors but rather complementary. Monero offers complete privacy/anonymity while Bitcoin will have opt-in privacy that is 'good enough' to preserve fungibility.

They probably are already putting pressure on miners. It is one of my theories regarding why Segwit was so heavily opposed by Bitmain. Segwit guarantees anonymity/fungibility for Bitcoin, and the PBOC doesn't want that to happen. If that is the case, the Chinese government wouldn't want to overstep and show their hand otherwise a PoW change would get pushed through and their ASICs would become worthless.

Depending on your electricity cost, you will probably lose money mining but you will still earn btc regardless. If you still want to give it a try, it is a fun experience that can teach you a lot. Easiest way to start is to buy an AntMiner ( and a power supply. All you have to do is plug it into the internet and into the power supply. Then use their interface to connect to a mining pool (it defaults to their own pool, AntPool). For the model I linked to above, you will earn approximately .0016 bitcoin per day.

Correct, that being said, the default random "one-use" passwords teamviewer generates aren't very secure (Only 6 characters I believe) and could be an easy target for bruteforce attacks.

1)Setup 2FA.

You just repeated what I said.
You need a unit of account for it to be decentralized but you could secure it based on business interests in a semi centralized model.
The scenario I'm imagining is one where you have a block chain that only has pre authorized members allowed to "mine". These trusted parties would be inclined to act in the best interests of the system because it would hurt their business relationships with the other parties if they didn't. Then you would be left with a centralized "block chain" that requires trust but would still give you the benefit of added transparency, multiple company integrated databases, and the ability for outsiders to easily interact with the chain when compared to traditional database systems.
Edit: I guess looking back at what you wrote, where we differ in thinking is that I don't think centralized "block chains" are pointless. I think there is value in both decentralized and centralized systems. That being said, the reason Bitcoin is a game changer in the first place is because it is decentralized.

Seem's unrelated to GAW Miners and Garza. Looks like the guy just has an inconvenient surname and doesn't realize how bad the name of his company looks after what Garza has done.
That being said, offering 11% over market price for bitcoin sounds suspicious to me. Why not just buy at market? If it is too good to be true, it probably is... I would suggest everyone take extreme caution before selling them any of your bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-10 06:59:34
1) A "seed" is basically a random phrase of words that backs up all of your coins. 
2) As long as you have your seed written down somewhere safe, you will always have access to your coins. 
3) It is important to keep the seed in a secure location because if someone accesses it then they have control of your coins.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:29:07
Exactly, the key is decentralized vs centralized.
If you want a centralized "block chain", then you don't need to necessarily have a unit of account, but a truly decentralized block chain requires one. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:11:34
Good point. Thought it was more than that. It's nothing compared to the 100k BTC sold by the USMS.
How do you guys usually sell them? Private sales? Exchanges?
Edit: Because how you sell them is just as important as the amount. If you are market selling on open exchanges at times of little buy support, you can initiate bigger slides in market price than selling a larger amount of coins off exchange like the USMS.

No it's like saying to a broke person that if they took a loan from someone they should pay it back.
The debt ceiling is an arbitrary limit that kicks in after the spending has already happened. America needs to cut back spending at the source, by not spending in the first place. 
Not raising the debt ceiling is like me putting a $100,000 car on my credit card and then when interest brings it to $105k saying, well it's past my debt ceiling of $102k so I'm going to declare bankruptcy. The real solution is to NOT BUY THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.
America needs to solve its debt problem, and the simple overview of the solution is that spending needs to go down. Defaulting by not raising the debt ceiling will just make America's credit rating plummet and make borrowing cost that much more. When the Republicans held the debt ceiling issue hostage, it almost did way more harm than any good that could have come of it.

You don't understand how the debt ceiling works. The debt ceiling is an arbitrary limit set after the spending has occurred. 
It would be like me putting a $100,000 car on my credit card and then when interest brings it to $105k saying, well it's past my debt ceiling of $102k so I'm going to declare bankruptcy. The real solution is to NOT BUY THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.
America needs to solve its debt problem, and the simple overview of the solution is that spending needs to go down. Defaulting by not raising the debt ceiling will just make America's credit rating plummet and make borrowing cost that much more. When the Republicans held the debt ceiling issue hostage, it almost did way more harm than any good that could have come of it.

The vote is non-binding, developers would still need to code any changes and users/miners would need to adopt those changes. It's just a way to judge the opinion/will of the economic majority when it comes to major changes. In the end, it is the Bitcoin investors that are placing a market value on each coin. A stakeholder vote allows their opinion to be heard.
Keep in mind that all major public corporations rely on a stakeholder voting model for their governance.

His main email account on Mail.com didn't have two factor authentication enabled. An attacker compromised that account through a "forgot my password" bug. Once they had access to his main account, they had a backdoor access into all of his other accounts.
**Moral of the story:** Treat your main email account with the most security possible. Always have two factor enabled. Make sure you aren't using a second-rate email provider (looking at you mail.com) or better yet run your own mailserver. And make sure that your main email password is completely different from all other passwords you use and is a [secure length/composition]( 
Also if your phone has access to your email account without a password needed, make sure your phone has full device encryption enabled and is pin protected. If your PC has your email password saved, make sure you aren't running logmein or teamviewer or any other remote access software that could give an attacker easy access. If you have to use one of those programs, you should have two factor setup. For the best security, keep your computer turned off when you aren't using it. 
Edit: A computer connected to the internet should never be treated as secure storage. It is fine for a daily spending wallet, only holding an amount of money you are willing to lose but not for anything medium to long term.
The best option for long term storage is probably still encrypted offline paper wallets:
A really user friendly option that allows you to spend your coins much easier is a hardware wallet such as the trezor. This is a much better option for those without significant computer skills:

American debt is at an all time high by far. Last time I checked it was over 13 trillion, definitely even higher now. Interest rates are the lowest they have ever been, which means that if the Fed wants to do another round of QE we will go into negative interest rates for the first time in the history of America. So where do we go from here? We can't raise rates because it will destroy the stock market and real estate, and we can't do more QE because we will go into negative interest rates. This is new territory; America's experiment with a currency not backed by gold is extremely new in the grand scheme of things.

Bitcoin holders are the ones who ultimately put a $$ value on each bitcoin. If changes are to be made to bitcoin that will change its value proposition then it is useful to gauge the opinion of those who own bitcoin.
I am not proposing a democracy, if anything it is closer to a "poll" or a "survey," since the vote is non-binding. Furthermore, it uses the Bitcoin block chain and is open source, so it can't be gamed like traditional online polls.
Last but not least, anyone can add questions to CryptoVoter's client since it is open source. The questions shown on their homepage are purely marketing and do not reflect the vote topics that may take place in the future.
FWIW personally I am pro-anonymity and against blacklisting. I support all initiatives working to increase bitcoin anonymity, currently optimistic about but ideally some sort of anonymity features will be added to Core in the future.

It means that if you place a buy or sell order on the exchange that is not at market price, you do not pay any trading fees. This is a method to increase the amount of bitcoin available to be bought or sold at any given time. 
Edit: This is called a maker/taker fee structure, where those who want a trade executed immediately (the taker) are the only ones who pay a trading fee (or they just pay more than the maker). Explanation of maker/taker fee structure can be found here:

These kind of issues are a perfect example of the inadequacies of current financial payment methods (credit cards and bank accounts). This is exactly what Bitcoin aims to solve and a future where everyone already has bitcoin won't have these types of issues where payments are blocked due to fraud prevention. 
I guess what I am trying to say is don't get turned off from Bitcoin from this experience, blame the current finance industry, and power forward. Even just a year ago, it was infinitely harder to buy bitcoin than it is today, believe it or not, it has continuously gotten easier and more accessible.

Love the idea of a full node opensource app ecosystem,  and bundling apps with the hardware will make it even more user friendly. I imagine the end result will be an open source "app store" allowing you and developers to monetize, while giving users access to some great programs. Also great to see some competition to bitnodes' bitseed project. More competition is always better for the ecosystem. 
One thing I've noticed with this whole block size debate is that ram is becoming more and more of a constricting factor to running full nodes. My suggestion: have exposed pci ports in your new hardware so users can add more ram after purchase if needed. 
Edit: In my first paragraph, I confused Bitnodes' full node project with their competitor bitseed. Both projects compete with this one, offering a plug-and-play full node solution. Once again, glad to see more competition in this space, and really like the idea of the app ecosystem which neither of your competitors has included in their projects yet.

My only issue with this analysis is how he just flat out dismisses "hoarders" and says they are bad for Bitcoin. 
Bitcoins greatest value proposition is as a secure store of value that cannot be seized or blocked by governments or corporations. If we all agree that we need an independent / decentralized wealth storage system then the price of bitcoin should rise as more and more people store their wealth in bitcoin. This is not "hoarding." Hoarding is intentionally a negative word, this is individuals saving their money, just like buying gold or putting your money in a a savings account isn't considered "hoarding."

Also don't forget the use of mixing services. 
Right now you have to rely on centralized services to do this, either an official bitcoin mixer or by using different exchanges/poker sites and switching into altcoins. That being said there are many decentralized projects being worked on, with the most promising being DarkWallet. The beauty of DarkWallet is that it doesn't require any change of the protocol so it allows bitcoin transactions to be as antonymous or transparent as you want them to be. Basically a sliding scale of anonymity. DarkWallet is currently under development and can use our help with donations:

When you have no trading fees, you naturally have more trades that occur because it becomes profitable to make even the smallest amount of money on trades. This is especially useful when running bots that require large amounts of trades for their algorithms to work properly. 
For this reason, I wouldn't say that the volume is "fake." Rather, you just have to realize the impact of no trading fees and analyze the data accordingly. You shouldn't be comparing volume numbers between exchanges with no trading fees versus those with trading fees, because of this difference.

well the idea is to diversify who can deconstruct your identity, so you would want to take your bitcoin, send them to "exchange 1" and buy "shitcoins" then take those "shitcoins" and transfer them to "exchange 2" and switch them to bitcoin, then withdraw the bitcoin from "exchange 2".
This would result in both exchanges needing to work together for anyone to connect the bitcoin you sent into "exchange 1" to the bitcoin you withdrew from "exchange 2".

Ideally the free market should support sites that are honest to their users and act in their best interests. For this reason, in the long term those who provide better quality service should make more $$ than those that don't but in the short term that is not the case. I have been actively involved in the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency media space for almost a year now and have seen some of the tactics used by sites for short term gain. Advising new users based on my experiences does not conflict with Libertarian ideals, and one of the main reasons I created  was to provide a way for users to easily keep track of reputable content. It's worth noting that we read all the articles that come out of the sites I mentioned above, and if they clean up their act, we will then start including them in our newsfeed. This is the free market at work.
Edit: [HERE]( is the fraudulent ads that NewsBTC ran for Paybase/GAW for months, even after it become clear to 90% of the community that Paycoin was a scam and that there were no partnerships with Walmart or Amazon or Target.

The idea that governments only seize money of "bad people" is flawed. Look at the rich people who went against Putin. He called them terrorists/enemies of the state and took their money.

Transparency wasn't the issue at Stamp or Coinapult and neither of their customers lost any money due to their respective hacks.

I don't reccomend anyone use newsbtc, cryptocoinnews, or bitcoinist. They have all run questionable ads, get paid for articles, pumped up scam coins, and are just otherwise not solid trustworthy sources of information.
My current project  provides a curated newsfeed that pulls from 30+ blogs and news sites to provide you with the most important stories. We read everything before it is approved and pushed to our newsfeed. Think of it like a curated r/bitcoin but with no duplicates or scam links. For instance, instead of writing a fluff piece about a press release or reddit post , we just link directly to the press release or post.
Furthermore, we don't run ads on our site, solely running on our own funds and user donations. This means that we work for our users' best interests, not for advertising partners. We have never and will never accept money to post "sponsored stories."

If you have a keylogger on your system, someone can easily grab your password the next time you type it in to Bitcoin Core to unencrypt. 
A computer connected to the internet should never be treated as secure storage. It is fine for a daily spending wallet, only holding an amount of money you are willing to lose but not for anything medium to long term.
The best option for long term storage is probably still encrypted offline paper wallets:
A really user friendly option that allows you to spend your coins much easier is a hardware wallet such as the trezor. This is a much better option for those without significant computer skills:

It is worth noting that even though the main pools are based in China that doesn't mean the actual mining hardware is located there. Even though lots of mining hardware is currently located in China, there are miners located worldwide that are currently pointing their rigs at the Chinese pools because they are reliable and have no fees. If those pools were to act against the Bitcoin network or if the Chinese government were to crack down on Bitcoin, you would see those miners located outside of China quickly point their rigs to other pools (theoretically).

FWIW I think Kraken is the only one currently offering it. But I agree, they all should offer it. Or atleast let you disable the email notifications. Coinbase even emails you when you send money to a bitcoin address and they list the address and the amount sent in clear text.

If they changed the supply schedule to make it infinite there would be a hard fork. Anyone who owned bitcoin at that point would get an equal amount of bitcoininfinite. Then the price of bitcoininfinite would collapse because it would not have a fixed supply. It would also probably hurt the reputation of bitcoin.
So it doesn't really make sense from a financial incentive standpoint to ever change the supply schedule to an infinite/inflationary based one.

If it were easy to do, the price would be the same. Usually in these situations it is because it is hard to get fiat in or out of the other exchange.

You have to look at market cap not price per coin. Eth is currently at half the price of Bitcoin based on market cap.

Not to mention, you can already choose to go that route using the current Bitcoin ecosystem.
Users can 'lock' their bitcoin to gold price using coinapult or bitreserve or use one of the various competing gold token systems. 
But just like you said, the downside of all those systems is the additional counterparty risk. For the digital asset to be tied to a real life asset(gold bars in this case), you always need to trust somebody to actually hold the real life asset.

They have no fees for trades so there is a lot more trades because people can afford to buy and sell for very small profits. Usually that is done with bots. So even though they have a lot more trade volume than the other exchanges, they aren't necessarily holding more customer bitcoins than the others. The same bitcoin could just be traded back and forth.

Agreed. Gavin is way too naive. He still hasn't denounced Craig Wright as Satoshi even though we have never been given proof. The real Satoshi can easily prove who he is, that is one of the beauties of Bitcoin. Wright hasn't given that proof, and yet Gavin has still not denounced him.
He also still doesn't realize that decentralization and censorship resistance is Bitcoin's key value proposition.
The same goes for Mike Hearn and a lesser extent to Garzik.
We are lucky we have the core devs we have. If Gavin had gotten his way, Bitcoin would look a lot more like Ripple today. A centralized network, with no real intrinsic value.

Coinbase's Main Wallet is insured if someone hacks them but not if you personally get hacked or phished. If you are going to store on Coinbase, use the Vault because they are time locked for 48hrs which adds an extra layer of security.

Correct. TAILS on a USB Drive is less secure than TAILS on a bootable CD-R because the drive can be manipulated by a malicious actor. However, there are many computers without cd drives and usb drives are definitely more convenient than CDs. 
That being said, booting TAILS, whether on USB or CD is more secure than booting into Linux Mint located on your built in harddrive. 
Like everything else, there is a tradeoff between security and convenience. Users need to decide on the right balance between the two dependent on their specific situation. 
**Sidenote:** Also, keep in mind that the "write switch" located on SD cards and USB drives is usually a software switch and doesn't actually stop the drive from being written to on a hardware level.

It's safer to use tails without any persistent storage so it wipes clean when you remove the USB drive. It would be secure if you write the 12 word seed on a piece a paper and then retype it into electrum everytime you boot tails. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:21:10
There is no such thing as a noob question. 12 Random words provides 128 bits of entropy which is more than enough. Of course, the more words in your seed, the better. Trezor's default to 24 words. 
There are 2^128 possible seeds for a deterministic wallet in Electrum. For comparison, the total number of Bitcoin addresses is 2^160.

Correct, but only if the bitmixer team is acting maliciously otherwise all records/logs are deleted. Unfortunately, you need to trust Bitmixer because it is a centralized service. You can reduce this trust by using it in combination with another mixer or using other methods such as depositing and withdrawing from exchanges in combination with bitmixer. Also if you connect to bitmixer using a VPN or TOR (which I highly recommend) you can reduce the amount of personal identifiable information that you are trusting Bitmixer with.
In the future we need decentralized solutions to this issue if we want Bitcoin to truly succeed on a global level. Right now, it does not look like we would ever have a situation where the core protocol is changed to build in mixing so our best option for the near future is Dark Wallet. Dark Wallet provides a decentralized and open source layer built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, essentially an open source wallet that mixes all users funds to preserve financial privacy.
The Dark Wallet team could have went with a coin IPO or some other presale borderline scam technique to raise funds but instead they chose to purely go the donation route. For this reason, they have raised a tiny fraction of the amount of money that projects such as Darkcoin have raised. We need to help support this important project. You can donate to the Dark Wallet team here:

Agreed. I've been advocating for better privacy in bitcoin for years. Fortunately, segwit enables many decentralized layer 2 privacy tools that should do the trick(tumblebit, mimblewimble, joinmarket). Also, segwit fixes tx malleability which will enable atomic cross chain swaps, so we should have decentralized exchanges soon.

In theory it seems awesome but no matter what it always come down to needing some type of centralized authority. The way I look at it is that we should be striving to decentralize as much as possible, but also be realistic that we can't decentralize everything.

But then they switch to a maker-taker fee structure so it will be similar. 
It's a free market, exchanges compete on fees and services to achieve higher volume. Just all needs to be taken into account when comparing the different exchanges.

The NSAs overreach will destroy the tech/internet industry in America over the next decade. Any major company or individual who values their privacy/security will now always choose to go with a domestic company over an American one. It amazes me how few Americans have actually looked at it from this amazingly simple economic angle. Spying has hurt American companies and will continue to hurt them, and that hurts America's growth potential.

When a hard fork occurs your coins are duplicated across both forks at the time of the fork. So if you had 10 bitcoin, then you would have 10 bitcoin and 10 bitcoinA when a hard fork occurs. Basically two separate coins would emerge and the free market would decide which one would have more value in the end.

Not really because of printer driver issues. However, you can make a kind of sorta paper wallet by booting into tails, launching electrum, and then writing the 12 words down on a piece of paper.

The block chain is an integral component/concept of the Bitcoin protocol that new users have to be educated on when they are first introduced to Bitcoin. For all intents and purposes, most users never need to know what a coinbase is to use/understand Bitcoin. If anything, when you say Coinbase now, more people think of the company than the actual term. 
It is important that we make sure new users understand that the Bitcoin Protocol does not rely on blockchain.com. By actively branding themselves as "Blockchain" they are intentionally confusing new users in order to achieve more profits.

They have a TOR portal as well, bitmixer2whesjgj.onion, but the clearnet option does give their users more flexibility. Not everyone is trying to hide their transactions from the NSA, some just need an effective easy way for basic financial privacy when using bitcoin (since all transactions are public info on the blockchain). The clearnet portal provides that, and appears to be one of the best current options for that type of use case currently available.

Centralized cryptocurrency based alternatives to bitcoin will soon be a reality and they will be both more efficient and cheaper than Bitcoin. So all the benefits you described will be benefits to those as well. Ripple is an example in that respect. 
That leaves Bitcoin with only one main value, it's decentralization. And in practice that means the inability of governments to seize funds or block transfers.

Right now you have to rely on centralized services to do this, either an official bitcoin mixer or by using different exchanges/poker sites and switching into altcoins. That being said there are many decentralized projects being worked on, with the most promising being DarkWallet. The beauty of DarkWallet is that it doesn't require any change of the protocol so it allows bitcoin transactions to be as antonymous or transparent as you want them to be. Basically a sliding scale of anonymity. DarkWallet is currently under development and can use our help with donations:

Other bitcoin related sites that are compromised or have malicous operators. For instance, hacked lists of bitcointalk and mtgox user emails can be found relatively easy on the internet. Many people use different passwords on different sites, which is good, but they still use the same email, making them a target.
Edit: That's why you should be wary of any site on r/bitcoin that asks for your email. All a malicious person would have to do is say they are coming out with a new service, and if you sign up for the waiting list you will get $10 free worth of bitcoin when it launches and they would pretty quickly get a huge list of bitcoiners volunteering their emails.

Completely agree and so does the BitMixer team. Their product offering is merely a stop-gap solution. 
I strongly believe in the need for decentralized open source privacy/anonymity solutions for Bitcoin. Without such solutions, I fear that Bitcoin could be surpassed by other cryptocurrency competitors that offer financial privacy built-in.
Currently the most promising and realistic decentralized project is DarkWallet. They rely on donations and we should all support them:  I actually dedicated a whole portion of the interview to the promotion of DarkWallet. 
Other possibilities such as sidechains or a hard fork to build something directly into the Bitcoin protocol will be much harder to implement but we strongly support those initiatives as well, because they promise to be much more powerful/robust options than DarkWallet.

While that is part of the reason, the other part is because Circle allows you to buy bitcoin with only a credit card. Credit Cards have high fraud risk and they run the risk of chargebacks as well. If Circle weren't so cautious, credit card fraud would run them out of business.
That's why we there are barely any competitors selling bitcoin for credit cards and why Coinbase requires you to connect a bank account for all purchases.

Cheap always on full nodes will be a very low margin business.
If we are going to speculate, maybe they are working on an asic that uses its extra heat to subsidize your hot water bill. That would really help to decentralize the network, making it affordable for the average home to run a miner.

When I say "We", I mean the Bitcoin Community. 
When the WSJ posts a story about 3M Blockchain wallets, that is really confusing to outsiders and beginners. It is almost intentionally misleading by the blockchain.info team. They know it confuses people but they don't care because they just want $$. 
Many owners of Bitcoin companies and websites frequent and we need to come together to boycott blockchain.info. My current project,  doesn't link to blockchain.info in any of our guides because we have noticed that it confuses our users. We also make sure that we always include the ".info" when we refer to them.  
Edit: TL;DR - They are acting in bad faith. There is no reason to support a company that is intentionally harming our community when there are many competitors now that offer similar or better services anyway. I have been a supporter of blockchain.info for years, but that is not the case anymore. Hopefully others in the community follow my lead.

Bitcoin Core uses UPNP to automatically forward the necessary port on your router. However, that doesn't always work right and in that case you have to manually log in to your router and forward the port. 
The easiest way to check that your port is forwarded is by hovering your mouse over the status bars on the bottom right of the Bitcoin Core window. Doing that tells you how many connections there are. If you have more than 8 connections, then the port is forwarded and everything is working correctly.

Definitely agree with that. What I'm saying is that companies/sites run by members of the Bitcoin Community should make sure to differentiate between the block chain and blockchain.info. That is the responsible thing to do and will make it much less confusing to users. 
Ideally, blockchain.info would brand themselves as "blockchain.info or blockchain.com" but they are actively trying to confuse people into thinking they are synonymous with the block chain. They will not change unless we make it more profitable for them to stop the practice than to continue it.

We basically will have the same situation we have right now with the altcoin market but on decentralized exchanges instead of centralized ones.

The problem is that it's too difficult to prove that someone is actually running a full node that is contributing. The main incentive of running a full node is more indirect. Companies/individuals in the Bitcoin space should be running reliable full nodes to support the network that they rely on to make money. Furthermore, running your own full node is the safest way to interact with the block chain because you don't need to trust anyone else.

IIRC there used to be even more China based full nodes. 
Also FWIW the two largest mining pools appear to be based in China, discus fish and antpool, and each pool needs at least one full node to operate.

I asked the remaining four candidates for their thoughts on the decision to reopen voter registration for the run off election. So far Perklin agrees with the decision while Olivier disagrees.
Edit: Bruce Fenton also agrees with the decision. And Jim Harper said he agrees with the decision on the Bitcoin Foundation Forums.

When it gets back up you can move your coins to another wallet, or sell them.

Nobody who values privacy/anonymity is going to use it over Bitcoin, Monero, DASH

Your fiat stats are incorrect.
According to Oxfam, the top 80 people in the world have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50%. And the system is rigged so those rich keep getting richer while the poor can't even easily save their wealth and grow it because of inflation.
The current system has a ton of wealth inequality. Bitcoin improves on that. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:03:07
Also another reason why I think a lot of these large wallets have lost private keys is because who in their right mind keeps that many coins in a single wallet.  As the price went up you would expect  the owners of the wallets to  divide up their bitcoins into smaller wallets so its not so obvious how much money they are holding. For example, I have less than 100 btc but when the price went over 300 I split it into multiple wallets because of paranoia and privacy.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:06:07
DarkWallet is not money laundering software. It is a financial privacy tool.
If we don't solve the privacy issue around a fully public ledger, bitcoin is going to be replaced by a cryptocurrency that does. Short of changing the protocol (which I don't seem happening), the best way to easily implement  financial privacy in bitcoin is through an open source/decentralized wallet implementation. 
We should all be supporting DarkWallet, it is one of the most important bitcoin projects currently under development.

If you send a new transaction from the same wallet with all your coins to a new address with a high fee it should push it through.

Also if coinbase closes shop/goes bankrupt you lose all your coins.

Yea and its the only major exchange that allows trading of LTC and other altcoins so people buy their btc on another exchange, transfer it to btce, and then trade it for alt coins pushing the price down.

Yes. Bitcoin Core. Then you just need to make sure the proper port is open on your router, port 8333. This port is usually opened automatically when you install Bitcoin Core through UPNP. However, sometimes it doesn't work right and you need to open the port manually.

Keep up the great work. Fullnode.co provides a valuable service. We link to it in our full node beginners guide here:

This is awesome and was sorely needed. 
I still think our guide to full nodes is more friendly/less overwhelming for beginners, but I'm biased ;-)

Coindesk blocked my comment from being posted on the article so ill post it here:  
"The article is a little misleading when discussing counterparty risk and reads a bit like an infomercial for Bitshares.
Instead of actually analyzing the merits of Larimer's claims, the article pretty much just presents them as facts."

I don't trust you anymore now that you are a proponent for an ethereum hard fork to roll back the lost DAO coins. An immutable ledger is fundamental to a decentralized block chain. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:09:32
Or a paper wallet
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:16:55
My thoughts exactly.  I feel like it his intentions would be perceived poorly if he admitted he owned bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:13:30
If a hard fork happens, You essentially have double the amt of coins, one set on the old block chain and one set on the new one.  Supply and demand will make it so your coins on the old block chain become worth zero but you still have the same amt of coins on the new blockchain. So as long as you don't panic you won't lose any money.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:30:02
How big is the transaction you're sending?  Coinbase keeps most of their coins in cold storage so they can't instantly transfer large amounts because they need a person to physically move the coins.  Try splitting it up into smaller transactions of 2btc or less.

The key is that they make most of their money from selling subscriptions to their trading terminals rather than ad sales like other news networks.  Networks that rely on ads often go for exaggerated headlines and they try hard not to upset their corporate ad partners.

it is a misconception that Bitcoin uses too much energy.
From a comment by :
From this table: 
I sort on the column for power/GH/s, and adopted a figure of 0.6 W/GH/s as representing current generation technology.  It varies by device, so I took a rough average of the top 15 or so models.
From here it looks like network speed is averaging ~ 9000 TH/s = 9,000,000 GH/s.  Multiplying that gives 5.4 MW if everyone uses efficient mining hardware.   Still not that big in absolute terms.  It about the power used in a downtown skyscraper.  Apple's data center in Maiden, NC uses ~ 20 MW

I wonder if any of it has to do with the hyper paranoia of btc people.  For instance, I make a new reddit account about every two weeks because of security reasons.  For that reason I have probably subscribed to this subreddit with 10 different accounts since I got started in btc back in April.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:12:55
I was thinking that too.  We should do it across the board. Mbtc is currently 70 cents usd, I think Americans are more mentally comfortable with that number than 700$/coin.

People should use blockchain.info to get the funds out of their paper wallets.  The process with them is so simple.  You literally just scan the QR code of the private key and they handle all the details for you.
