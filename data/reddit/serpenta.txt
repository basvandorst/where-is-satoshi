So I guess that makes you a martyr. If you know about money, than you know that money != ideolodogy.
Don't get me wrong, I hope for bitcoin the very best and because of reasons you put out. I can even donate. But I will never buy all in.

I sold at 901 and bought back at 880 - I am the unluckiest guy in the world (or stupidest), cause market always does the opposite of what I do xD

By "nation's spirit" I didn't mean Hegel's notion of it. I do apologize, but I'm accustomed to word "nation", although I am aware of post-national reality we are living in now, and I often use it in bad context, actually meaning citizenry. I am as far from Hegel, as I possibly could, when it comes to political theory and in general, as a kantian purist.

I use alterations one password for unimportant stuff, so I can only remember the pattern and try until I get it right. For important stuff, like bank, e-mail etc, I use 128-bit hashes... and remember them. It helps with memory :P and double protects them: no one will be able learn them until dream inception is possible and they cannot get lost ;)

My internet identity is "serpenta" (as long as it's not already taken; pesky impostors), it's a Latin name, do you suggest I'm a Roman?

This makes me a lot more optimistic about the future of the Internet and the outcome of struggle against regulation. Sure, it is full of filth, but at the same time it produces a lot more goodness, humane and cultural, educational value than it needs to balance that filth out. 
All that by simply letting people to establish communities, exchange ideas and learn. And, for me, most of all it lets every person, 1/6 billionth of humanity, to put it's tiny brick in the developement of the whole. And this is really hard to achieve in centralized society. So great news! :)

That's partly true, but I really would prefer USSR to leave us alone back then and get more time to rebuilt instead. Even economically this "deal" seized being beneficial in 60's when we started to fall behind developed world.
I realize this is not my decision to make, as I am much too young to be even faintly touched by the hardship of rebuilding country on our own, but still I would prefer it to be so, because I just detest what communists did to how our society looks and what values it cherishes.
Yes, we love freedom more than anyone now, but we always did. It was the very cause of Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth's demise, as we had practically decentralized rule before everyone around us. And decentralized states, although an ideal now, are just weaker in comparison to authoritarian ones.
And so, in my opinion, we got only bad traits as a nation. Like if we were free after WW1 and WW2 on, we would not accumulate those traits, cause the divisions of Poland actually made our nation's spirit stronger and people better. But communism made us lazy and not caring, and it's a state which my generation (born 80-90) has to get out from in order for this country to flourish, and it's darn hard.
And gets even harder, because communism also thought a great deal of our parents not to take responsibility for our own state and country. Earlier, all the dictatorships were external to us, while People's Republic of Poland was governed by poles, and so to many Poland just died.
And today, those who are willing to work and have skills leave the country, not willing to take what they would be paid here.

Well, with the amount of adrenaline and endorphine at stake it's not unbelievable at all. The way I see it, gambling is basically the same type of addiction as x-sports or parachuting. Just costs more.
