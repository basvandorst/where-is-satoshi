This is one of those overlooked coins that people are going to be kicking themselves for not paying attention before they blew up.  The fork is not a one off thing, its the start of the larger vision of becoming a mesh of interconnected bitcoin forks bringing SmartContracts to Bitcoin ala rootstock.

The cancer here is your business model.  Centralized pools have to go away.  The solution you are looking for is to pivot to a different business model where growth past a threshold does not destabilize the ecosystem it relies on.

I know this may seem crazy to you, but I would think twice about buying a home unless you are paying cash (i.e. sans-loan).  If you are thinking of jumping into a mortgage, you will most definitely be better of simply renting.  
If you do the math, after 30 years a home buyer who pays a mortgage for the duration and then sells off, and a renter who put the extra money on a low yield savings account, ends up with the same amount of cash.  Your home ends up being the equivalent of a forced low yield savings account, which robs you of opportunities you might have taken with that cash during the duration of the loan. [Read this.](

You were somehow able to calculate the peak price based on the current state of the infrastructure? You are either a financial genius or full of hot air.  I wonder what you will say in a few months when the price breaks 3k.
It could  be decades before Bitcoin reaches the market cap necessary for its stabilization.  Until then these cycles could continue regardless.  But by that point, early adopters (we will all be called early adopters 10 years from now) that kept a good sized stash of coins will be the winners.  And by winners I mean filthy rich.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:33:28
The number of coins you buy is irrelevant.  In a few years when it reaches into the 6 digit range the majority of people won't be able to afford a single Bitcoin anyways.  If you believe in Bitcoin, putting money on it **now**, regardless the price, is still the smartest thing to do.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:20:29
True enough, but if the 10k pizza guy, after eating his 2 pizzas, had bought back his 10k Bitcoin to replenish his reserves, he would be $6 million richer right now.

@_date: 2013-11-21 08:07:51
Once it went past the previous bubble's peak, how could you be sure when to exit?  Some exited at $300 (lost), some exited at $400 (lost), $500 (lost), $600 (broke even), $700 - $900 (made money).  But what if it had gone up to $3000 and you had exited at $900?  You would have lost a potential fortune.  There was no way to know.  It's completely unpredictable.  If you made money, you got lucky.  For every lucky bastard that timed the market right on a fluke, there is some sad bastard who timed it wrong.  Which will you be next time around?  It's a roll of the dice.  
But you know who is always winning?  The guys who believed in Bitcoins potential and held on to their Bitcoin.  The guys who did this the past couple of years are now the current crop of Bitcoin millionaires.  Want to be a Bitcoin millionaire 10 years from now?  Hold on to the Bitcoins you have now and keep on buying when it is opportune to do so. 
If you want to use Bitcoin, use it.  But be sure to buy back the same amount at the current market price.  Don't whittle away your reserves.

There's enough people around the world doing that.  The smarter ones will hold on to their Bitcoin.  Come back to this thread 5 years from now, then we can calculate how much all the Bitcoin you let go would be worth had you held on to it (or bought it back after use).

Yep, pretty sure all Silk Road vendors have either moved over to BMR or are laying low with future plans of moving over to BMR or SR 2.0.  
SR's closure did not kill the overall market, the supply and demand are still there and the ability to supply it as well.  It merely served as a wake up call to pay more attention to marketplaces' security.  The war on drugs is always the same, one hole gets plugged and five more open someplace else. It cannot be won.

I bought at the peak of the last bubble for $240 before it fell to $90.  Felt exactly like you.  Those were big numbers back then.  When the price starts getting counted in the thousands you'll be happy you bought them at that price.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:00:26
We got China all-in on the Bitcoins.  We got startups and VCs pouring millions of dollars to building it's infrastructure.  We got the senate creating regulation for Bitcoin.  We got all these companies accepting Bitcoin.  Pretty soon, when regulation is in place, we will have the big players going all-in.  Do I see a future where my current investment is multiplied 1000 fold?  Yes I do.
