Follow the links in the article. The way I understand it, she sent him the git history.

Your "China is bad and does not care about its people" point of view is a lot more American than that of OP.

That's.... That's not what I was doing at all. Pointing out who the US President is should not be "bringing politics into this thread" unless that fact somehow really bothers someone.
I was just making fun of the fact that this dude claims he predicted everything exactly how it happened, and everyone is taking his word for it for some reason. So I told my story which makes no sense since I say I predicted it so long ago that neither I nor Trump could have possibly even been born.
If the mention of the President is too bothersome that's one thing, but I was just having some fun. I would consider it to be "bringing politics" if I was expressing an opinion.
To each his own I guess.

Is this copypasta?

I can see that. Not the intention!

This makes sense, but he's also trying very hard to prove a point. It doesn't seem like he's print any effort into refuting his own points, tending to not mention any benefits where they do exist.
Do you know of any article written as a counterpoint to this? I'd be curious to read a good retort.

Wow, that's like how 133 years ago I said Donald Trump would be president in 2017 and everyone was like "No way!" and "Who is that?"
Those that sat and listened started to get as enthused as I by these new possibilities, but most were like "...but muhhh. Apprentice!"
Almost exactly 133 years later, Donald Trump was president in 2017 ;)
