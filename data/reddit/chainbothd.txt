You can replace/add HDDs as you like, on the more, the "RAM" plays only a marginal role in a RISC SOC compared to traditional systems and architectures... not talking about configuring a swap file/partition possibly... or about how many advantages you would have by using such kind of platform instead of traditional ones.
The ChainBot HD-v1 is equipped with 2GB of RAM and it uses a few hundred MBs to run bitcoind "in full". As you can see in the pictures on the website (soon it will be also available a video demo too) it uses around 500MB in standard mode while concurrently running a fullHD desktop session that was enabled at that moment. 
When (possibly in years from now) the Bitcoin Network will grow "esponentially" and without any common-sense control as everybody hopes, you will be able to configure the good-old ChainBot HD-v1 to serve less clients/people or you could use it to accomplish other "Hardware Decentralizer tasks" at infrastructure level. Simply as you can still use an android phone from 2009 or a GSM phone... or Teh Internet! :)

Kernel sources will be released as always stated, usually there's no need to add fancy new kernel drivers support to stable machines like you can see in linux distributions for server use, for example. (a vast majority of webservers run on 2.6.something kernels, as you know)
FYI, it is also available a LIGHT version of the ChainBot HD-v1 that it is cheaper than the "complete" one.
Let's see what will happen in five years!  :)

check your router, embedded systems or CentOS distros for examples. You can also ask to the Debian Devs why the don't upgrade on a every basis, etc..
This kind of "platforms" have a dedicated OS (kernel) that specifically "fits" the hardware layer. They are not assembled desktop PCs or gaming stations.
