I didn't respond initially because I knew this conversation would go somewhere else. I am talking about Winklevoss twins here, who do not fall into the typical billionaire profile. 
My point was there are only handful of people who are born in perfect setting and succeed in that highly competitive environment. Imagine the odds of a person who is born rich, go to Harvard, represent the country in Olympics, invent super popular website and find niche in Bitcoin. They are well deserving of being billionaires as they have excelled in every field that they entered. 
There is no survivorship bias here mate that's what's up, they have not failed in life yet.

The already had won the jackpot of life and now they are billionaires. What I mean by that is Olympic winning athletes, born in a wealthy family, Studied in Harvard, extremely intelligent and could have founded Facebook. 
I mean do they ever have a bad day ffs ?

Being screwed over does not equate to failure, $65 million is not a failure. Good thing you didn't say that they didn't win gold in Olympics so they failed.

Yes they would have obviously been able to pay their lawyers, what world are you living in. There is a fallacy in your argument, you just can't ignore facts and say survivorship bias. Yes it exists but not in this situation. You are just trying to sound very smart by ignoring core part of the discussion.

With comments like these I realize why the Crypto prices are inflated and most of them are idiots like you.

 Judging by your response you seem to be ignorant or an idiot. Any billionaire don't need Bitcoin money, secondly I said significant amount not Most and you should probably Google this.

I don't know what kind of tinfoil hat you are wearing but banks are integral part of a society. Humans run bank and all the systems in place, which means they would fuck up sometimes. If you want to believe that Bitcoin is the Fiat killer I would highly encourage you to just travel to the third world countries and see the reality of the world.

It wouldn't surprise me if a significant chunk of Bitcoin is being held by few whales. And believe me big money has already cashed out.

This sub is all about confirmation bias and wishful thinking. This year was a great learning experience for everyone in this sub who thinks that Bitcoin will only go up. Believe in crypto currency not the price.

I love when pro Bitcoin people juxtapose things so that it fits their narrative.

Rookie mistake. It's cool that you're so passionate for investing Bitcoin but you should've studied more about how to invest. My advice to you is sell half of your coins and buy more (if) when Bitcoin goes down to $1000. You can't go all in on any investment let alone such a volatile currency. I don't know if this is troll or not but it looks like a very naive "investment" move.
