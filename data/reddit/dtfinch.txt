I wouldn't call $5/month for 1gb overpriced, though it's nice to see there's always something cheaper. DO is 1/4 what I paid for a Rackspace cloud server, which was 1/2 what AWS was charging. At this point it's like buying a can of coke for 8 cents, and learning that someone down the street is selling them for 2.
Edit: oh wow I forgot I was paying $10, not $5. wow.

The first number's only displayed to 5 digits accuracy, and the sums match for that many digits. I imagine the only problem is neglecting to display all 8 digits all of the time.

It's also not exactly an apples to apples comparison. You get more control over the OS with KVM or Xen hosting, while on OpenVZ everyone shares the same OS instance. A VM has the downside of being more wasteful of resources. OpenVZ has the downside of being easy to oversell. Your 1gb server might be sharing 32gb with a hundred other 1gb servers. It's your limit rather than your share, and you might get swapped out when idle. Adding 1gb of swap to a 1gb VM server doesn't make it a 2gb server on the other hand.

How this typically works, is if you have 50 votes to keep, and 2 votes to delete, you can bet it's going to be deleted.

"Government is inevitable" probably fits better. An absence of government leads to government. Something has to occupy the power vacuum, or something else will step up to fill it.

Anyone can use the numbers on one of your checks to drain your account via ACH transfer. Security by armed government officers after the fact.
