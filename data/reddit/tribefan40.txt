Thanks for the tip.  The private key is what I set myself or are those generated by the app?  I plan on putting software on my computer in the near future but I've heard that it takes a lot of space so I'm trying to navigate that by seeing if I can get a deal on a computer.

How does this work?  I'm trying to understand bitcoin, I'll take a "tip"

Sorry - I'm using the bitcoin mobile app.  I have no bitcoins so I haven't delved into practical cases, mostly talking hypothetically.

They coins are on the network but no one can access them if one does not have the private key associated with the public key that is visible to everyone?  Is that what the software does?  Generate private keys for public keys?

So the backup I created is an encrypted copy of my public and private keys?  I thought I read that I should write down my public and private keys on a piece of paper in case something happens to my device or computer.  I get that the deterministic strategy would be the most secure, but to help me understand the mechanics of this, in my own dumb way, I want to view my private key, which does not sound possible or is not separateable (word?) at the moment until the deterministic wallet is perfected.

Also - I'm having problems viewing my private key.  I've created it and backed it up, but I only have it electronically and can't write it down as I've seen recommended various places.
