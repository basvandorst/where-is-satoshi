I'm not sure why you're being downvoted, this is correct as even Satoshi himself said if the numbers and exchange rates got too out of hand the decimal place could be moved. If anyone takes that time to read everything that has happened to this point you're mindset will change.  
  
Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.
But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally.  It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000.  If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.

but it doesn't seem like they're making more GPU's than if crypto wasn't a thing... just that those that would have been in stock anyways are gone due to crypto. Surely production was increased some due to crypto but I'm not sure it was enough to leave  huge hurt of them if it "poofed" one day. No?
