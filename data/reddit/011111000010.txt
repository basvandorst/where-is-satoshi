2000 bits to you
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:33:45
Exactly. I love to act like I am a local. Meter, krap. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:44:30
so sad (sick).
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:57:56
It's a guess. IMO
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:42:35

Isn't that the reason you use days destroyed as a messure? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:49:42
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:12:12
yes please
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:20:45
Bitcoin days destroyed would be better than volume I would say. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:57:54
He. Is. The. Man.

You can vote. At least in Europe you have options.

Never trust a skinny chef I would like to add

I don't even care anymore 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:01:18
Not much too know there. But yes I am sure. You have to declare any profits from selling your bitcoin in "Anlage SO" when doing your tax. Everything is considered FIFO.
This only applies while making profits before 1 year of hodling.
Bitcoin is considered like a foreign currency. Same rules. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:08:23
Hodling for 1 year and it's tax free in Germany 
@_date: 2019-12-06 06:03:12
You think that's fo real?
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:16:18
I will, too
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:12:28
I bought early and cheap. Still outperformed my FTSE All-World Portfolio by far :) so it's a yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:11:42
Exactly

Well, snowden tranfers some money to different addresses to actually spend it or cold storage or whatever. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:49:39
Twitchalerts should integrate Bitcoin finally.

@_date: 2018-07-03 02:30:36
Bitch! 
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:55:03

@_date: 2017-07-07 05:19:33
That's a bold claim. Wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:59:14

Whats good about this is the fact that the porn industry sets standards. They seem to always be the first who adapt.
