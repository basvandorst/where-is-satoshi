Not intrinsically, no. Value is in the eye of the person valuing it.
It is all subjective.

He's not black.
Only a black gay dude would get away with this today. Because he's A VICTIMMMMMM BRUHHHH. A millionaire, child star actor weirdo, that has lived a life of privilege...BUT HE'S GAY AND BLACK BRUHHHH...SO HE'S AN OPPRESSED SOUL YOU GUYSSSS..
On another note, he was in the movie The Mighty Ducks also? So was that other weirdo...the guy that wears the goofy hats and clothing that shills EOS and is trying to become trustee of Mt Gox for his own benefit? What the fuck is his name again?
Both in The Mighty Ducks movie from like 1994. WHAT IN THE FUCK DID THEY DO TO THESE KIDS ON THAT MOVIE SET? Lol...

I GOTTA SAY
You spend entirely too much time on Reddit, pontificating your genius opinions, while in the process divulging to anyone with a brain what an angry and unfulfilled person you really are.
I swear, every thread there's i_gotta_say, letting us all know how brilliant he is. (And by "brilliant" I mean just probably clinically depressed from a lack of vagina or actual friends)
Do this, seriously: Take a break. There's more to life than being a fucking know-it-all on the internet.

Actually, Bitcoin most closely resembles commodity money. 
Nothing has intrinsic value.

Not correct.
Use a passphrase and physical attacks are useless against Trezor. 
And physical attacks? Are you serious?
Are the smartest minds at MIT all going to magically show up to the house of the guy that stole your Trezor, so they can extract your 0.4 BTC?

Using Coinbase in this way may work with small time purchases once in a while. But if Coinbase found out a dispensary is using their platform, BYE BYE COINBASE ACCOUNT.

Most "Asian Americans" aren't Asian...they are Western.
If you were born and raised in the US..YOU ARE AMERICAN. Doesn't matter if your eyes are almond shaped or not.
WHEN "ASIAN AMERICANS" GO TO THEIR "HOMELAND" IN ASIA, THEY FIND OUT VERY QUICKLY HOW "ASIAN" THEY ARE NOT.
Do you call a white guy from New Jersey whose great great grandparents were British "Anglosaxon American"?
Fuck I hate Americans.

Oh yeah?
Considering the sentencing guidelines for money laundering, he was smart to plead guilty.
Do you know what the federal conviction rate is for those that go to trial?
You have no idea because you've never been in that situation.
He's been locked up in a MDC for a while. If you were in that situation and someone said, "Go home now with time served or go to trial and potentially stay here another 8 years" WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Fucking clueless keyboard warriors. You fuckheads are such badasses that would NEVER GIVE IN!

No, because marijuana dispensaries have to pay distributors and other expenses in USD. If you have to pay these expenses in USD, you cannot take on the price volatility risk by accepting BTC.
Also, you cannot use a service like Bitpay to convert BTC payments to USD because companies like Bitpay are subject to the same AML restrictions as any regulated financial institution. 
So no, BTC is not a good use-case for legal cannabis dispensaries in its current state.
