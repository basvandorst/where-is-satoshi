Totally true.  I lost about 15 BTC that way.  Sold at the bottom - went to sleep disgusted - then saw it was going up again like mad - bought high - sold again when it dumped.  
I was very stupid at the beginning.

I am up several orders of magnitude from my initial investment.  It worked well for me.

That fake internet money will never take off.   :)

There would be no need for a split for this.  The number is a 64 bit number anyway - it has more than enough depth.

Have you shown them the Satoshi whitepaper?  That is ultimately what sold me.  When my pot dealer friend was mining it back in the day I thought it was warcraft money.  But the whitepaper described a very clever system that equated to a redefinition of money in a totally decentralized way.  It was acid on the foundations of power structures that have been in place for thousands of years.  
Then I read the comments in the genesis block - and it was clear what the goal was.  Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a revolution.

Tulip Mania is an economic urban legend.

Its dollar cost averaging.  You buy at a constant rate and the average price for the year is what you get.  Works well from my perspective.

I fully believe bitcoin will outlast the dollar.  HODL and BTFD

Buy more now.  Just toss in what you can afford to lose and let it ride.  I have followed that strategy through the crazy bubbles and crashes - worked well for me.

My uncle said the same thing about an online bookstore.  Who the hell would buy books online.  Thankfully I did not listen to my uncle and plunked down a lot of money on this plucky CEO named Bezos and his vision.

That is a poor analogy.

These smug fucking kids deserve to have their asses handed to them.  You push them some knowledge and they act like the old man is shaking his fists at clouds.  
I recall AOL being the big dog pulling in all the business in the world from all ISPs.  And it died too.  
Bitcoin - in my opinion - is the base internet coin.  The Google/Facebook/Centralized Social Network shit was always the wrong direction.  It was a return to AOL but with a slightly more smooth interface.  But I think BTC and the ecosystem of blockchain and tangle --- is going to be world changing.  
I am of the opinion that it is not unkillable now - but when it reaches market caps the size of its potential - I think it will be unkillable.  By the last block mined - it will be the core of world commerce.  
Or it could go to zero. :)

I guess if you imagine the fixed sum of 240 trillion is somehow locked in place and does not grow with time - maybe.

If I have another kid I am naming him Satoshi.  Whoever that madman (or woman) was - he was a genius.

I think people are not looking at the big picture.  The fiat currency outlook in the long term is very unstable.  We have a monster bubble that will burst some time in the next few years from education financing defaults.  Those cannot be charged off or eliminated by bankruptcy and the the tranches go to zero when the defaults are too great.  
We have 20 trillion in debt and an aging population.  We have a possible civil war that might be happening.  The only thing that keeps the dollar as a backing store is a shit ton of guns - but its only good while people think the US can impose force.  
Things have never been more ripe for a hell of a collapse.  
Bitcoin is an international hedge against that and having a decentralized method of maintaining an economy could very well be the way things finally transition.  Chaos is coming - and I think BTC will be there after the fall.  
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:38:20
Not really.  If it has just a fraction of the gold value stored in it and it is used as a backing store for other cryptos - it could easily surpass a million.

The dollar is used everywhere on the planet. There would be a black market for your bitcoin money if it was stranded but you could get it.   
And that restriction would have to apply to gift cards, credit cards, foreign currency, gold, property, or any other item that can be bought and sold.  
it is not crack.  They have no grounds to make its sale illegal.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:48:06
It is friday.  The Chinese always try to kill crypto right before the weekend to get a nice weekend sale.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:49:43
Personally I put money into bitcoin in the hope that it is a meme that slowly eats the foundations of global finance and it becomes the preeminent store of digital wealth on the planet some day.  I think this local boom will bust soon and I will go back to accumulating as the system continues to propagate.  
Bitcoin is going to be what countries peg their currency to someday.

My fear with regulation comes the barrier to entry to be able to buy and trade.  Half the fun of this hobby has been to play the market with these coins.  If this becomes something where only qualified investors can play - it will be garbage.

Certainly - but I think there are an equal - if not greater number of people that are less willing to be Luddites.

Well - it is stored one way or another.  You can store it in a mound of shiny metal or something that is liquid enough to send anywhere in the world in minutes.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:23:21
This is totally real guys. All the world is banning them too.  This is true.  Get your money out of BTC as fast as possible - it is all crashing.  GO!  NOW!  Go to your cold store and transfer it all in - and Sell Sell Sell.  
Then let me know when you are done.  I um... I  - have some shopping to do. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:44:44
I don't think that is unreasonable.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:55:51
To be fair - that was the case a few years ago - but I think is has a base price closer to 2k now.  I think it is definitely overinflated now - and that a long bear market will deflate it over time - but over a 10 year time horizon - it could be as big as gold.  
But that is 4 hype cycles away. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:37:58
He is also saying North Korea could use it as an attack vector against other nationstates by buying blocks of it and controlling the price.  
But that would just make it important for the US to do the same - and that would drive the price up for all the early adopters and dorks - which would rapidly change the power dynamics of the economy.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:26:56
Money is just a global delusion.   Oil is power.  Resources are power.  Killing is power.  That is what money is really about.  Its about the ability for this government to convince people to trust it or fear it enough to hold its currency.  
Yes Bitcoin will eventually win.  But it will take time.  In the meantime you can make a LOT of money off of the competition.  Ripple, for instance, is going to be held up collectively by fiats.  It has a great potential to be a real hedge against Bitcoin in case something like Roger Ver being insane causes incomprehensible FUD.  
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:51:19
They all seem to use coinbase to jump in.  I think Coinbase should have an "intro to crypto 101" course embedded within it that helps people get onboard with the idea.  A global deflationary store of value is a hard idea for a lot of people to grasp without really walking them through the idea.

Its great that you fans of fiat are out there.  Obviously most of my money is in fiat now - but eventually - bitcoin will win. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:44:08
Those bags of shit are destroying cryptocurrency credibility if it ever had any to begin with.  It is disappointing.  The amateur hour shit that happens within Bitcoin makes me sick.  
Honestly - I hold a lot of $xrp because it is the most grown up and likely to be actually used cryptocurrency.   If bank adoption happens the only thing $btc will be good for is buying Molly - and Monero is better for that anyway.  
The whole thing is sad.  It pisses me off.  And honestly I think the reduction in volume dramatically over the past few weeks is largely due to these assholes.

Eventually - when the sun bloats out to a dying red giant and scours the earth with atomic fire - the price of galactic subspace bitcoin will be the equivalent of 99 quadrillion dollars.  
I think Moneybadger is in this as long as the network exists and cryptography keeps up with quantum computing.

I think of it as more of a pure meme.  Its like language or mathematics.  Its an abstraction free of the constraints of matter but we all share the same meme.  
I think the internet and the use of technology has prepared people to accept this idea - and the cypherpunk aspects of it are kind of tech chic too.

Ethereum is going to have the same scaling problems and the scammy ICOs have tainted it in a lot of people's minds.  It is on a bear trend now and will be for a long while.  
Honestly - the only coin that really seems like something big money would use is the one everyone in the crypto-community hates -- that is $xrp.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:37:22
Well - its coming to every country the evil whites control.  The west has already fallen and the evil whites will be purged.  Then profit.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:52:20
I agree.  Honestly - the only cryptocurrency that I feel actually is run by adults is $xrp.  And it is the least popular crypocurrency in the community (based on the anarcho-fanatics sentiment).  
I do not think banks will use $BTC for large transactions - but I can certainly see a huge value proposition for them using ripplenet.  Then they have someone to sue -- and that entity has a mass of coin it could lose if it screws up.  
I think its the only adult solution to the liquidity problem.
