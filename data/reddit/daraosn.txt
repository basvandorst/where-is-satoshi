They helped me cancelling a transaction once, just right in the crash when DAO was being emptied/hacked. I love ShapeShift!

Not true, they said something. And it's not that they are denying it, they are actually "waiting for an update" (now speculation here: maybe from coinbase as overstock deal today?).

But it's better to just log to the file and `tail` it, imo.

Not sure if you say like this in bitcoin, but on ethereum (parity) you have archive mode, which means no pruning.

Just running a full archive node, that's the log output from bitcoin core (bitcoind), block  was the last one before divergence.

By default it logs to ~/.bitcoin/debug.log but you can run it with `bitcoind -printtoconsole` param or just `tail ~/.bitcoin/debug.log`

Exactly... wtf guys, so many fails in a row... let me do an ELI5 math for you:
25000 / 4000 = 6.25 = +525%
Explanation: the change base is always 0% (I don't win, I don't lose, no variation)... When I say I gained +100% that is a 2x, example: bought at $1000, sold at $2000 ... 2000/1000 = 2.0 = +100%

Thanks! It's definitely an interesting strategy, and if you watch the video, we would be happy to know your thoughts!
