Fuck yes! I'm a disabled veteran with PTSD. It sucks, I've been on every pharmaceutical out there... When PTSD was phasing out of being called "Shellshocked" the good doctors at Ft. Bragg used us like Guinea pigs back then. Now I'm recovering from the damages the meds have done to my liver. Still on Prozac, Clonazepam, Prazosin. I just want something that works to treat my PTSD other than anti-depressants, sedatives that just make me a zombie.

On a serious note, I'm selling all the BTC I have for GRLC. BTC was fun and I think it's time to move on to something better.

If it's with my jetpack I bought with GRLC to jump to the moon, yes.

GRLC is meme

So far I've mined 98 GRLC.

Happy learning! I've learned so much about Crypto, mining, setting up a remote VM, trading, and so much more. Even if this doesn't take off, it's a really good way to get into Cryptocurrency as you don't have to put in any $$$ to run a miner on your PC or remote VM. Just make sure you calculate the cost ratio for electricity and whatnot. Welcome to the world of Garlicoin! &lt;3

You can also start out buying $150 per day and the limit increases to $300 per day in a few days if you purchase. It's imo wayyy better than coinbase. The support is pretty fast too!

It has the lowest rates for paypal transactions by far. Is there a better place you can buy with paypal?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:58:11
Where would you suggest buying with paypal then?

I've recently had troubles with coinbase and their support was just really bad so I looked for alternatives and came across this gem. Give it a try. ^^

Ok, I'll get a loan to get the 500 GH/s Bitcoin Miner from Butterfly? With this how much should I make a month?

I heard about mining for them. Is it too late for that?
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:31:40
So they are like stocks. Does it seem like they will keep going up in price?
