Umh, nope. Everyone can just download it and type in whatever fuck amount of bitcoins they like. How do they predict which holdings are real, and which are just for fun?

Hilarious and ignorant, im all for BTC but this shit just looks like some HODL wank material.

If it is money that you can waste yes, consider what you put in an investment, and you might get nothing at all when you sell (Highly unlikely.)

Nice bamboozle, everyone can write 100'000 BTC on a harddrive.

We dont care about your corporate problems, America.
Fucking redditors thinking forgetting about the other 200 countries in the world

Its math for children, be glad that one guy stopped stealing 40 cakes.

I have never figured out the 1:1 coin conversion on a split, and what it means for me.
I have my coins in a personal electrum wallet, when/if this fork happens, am i able to take those BTSI and immediately sell them?
Thanks for those willing to explain.

How is this not also about bitcoin and its investors and exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:08:27
Bitcoin.com tries to tell you that bitcoinCASH is the real bitcoin...
No matter how many forks or whatever happens, the first bitcoin will always be THE bitcoin, everything else is just trying to cheat the system for their own winning.

Nah, most people in EU get .com i think.
I still do
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:42:48
Thats what i have understand so far. I have my private keys, so say this fork comes, what do i do to sell them? Where do i go, where do i find them etc.?
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:49:43
See this is the problem with you guys. "got a lot of muscle AGAINST those countries"
I dont know if you know, but by saying "forgetting about the other 200 countries" im actually talking about every country, because there is less than 200 in total.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:58:54
Alright :) 
Was just as confused when it split to BCash, people were shouting free monies, but i never saw anything explaining what for instance an electrum wallet user can do to sell the shit alt coin.

i feel ya! doubled my investment in 3 months! Hard to not get excited!
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:50:41
Thanks for explaining ��
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:24:56
Thank you, had no idea what it was called even.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:59:32
Well there is your mistake.
If you put all your money in crypto, how will you buy crypto when we get great deals like today?
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:56:35
Umh, why should we give our keys away? thats not really power to the people is it?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:40:20
Why so fixated on exact bitcoins? get a few for the money you are able to "waste"

I dont think there is a official piratebay anymore.
Its just a network that everyone can host the website for, so there are literary hundreds of them
