Like I said, take it or leave it. My prediction means nothing. It’s just a look at the historical pattern.

Because exchanges are where most of the laundering is happening.
Honestly, i still havent seen an official source from china saying theyre banning exchanges yet. BTCC said theyre suspending trading. China will regulate exchanges, that is certain, if they have to shut down exchanges temporarily to do it then they will but it will only be temporary until they meet licensing requirements.

What makes you think China is cashing out?
China is invested heavily in Bitcoin and they will continue to invest. China has stated many times they will work with bitcoin its just regulating it before it gets out of control.
This entire drop is all FUD. Nothing else.
Edit** By regulating before it gets out of control, i mean they want to stop the fake ICOs from popping up that is causing money laundering. Really, that is good for bitcoin.
