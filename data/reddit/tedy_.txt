Can't anyone check where these coins came from? They're from  address from 2013 and have nothing to do with the hack.
However, if the "hacker" or rich guy feel generous here is my address: 1thxJLzFokKXjX88LT2jakUWsexVeGVKX

Come on guys, it's blockchain for a reason.
Can't anyone check where these coins came from?
They have nothing do to with Bitfinex ffs.

I agree, it's much better to spend $15 on every single transaction than one time $50 on HDD.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:48:49
Back to $10? I've never seen it trading at $10. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:54:33
I don't know man, don't they have time to raise the block size or...?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:06:26
This is a lie. Bitcoin.com wallet checks for coins on both chains, so even if sent to wrong address, coins will still appear in wallet. So, either your friend is a complete moron who sent bitcoins to address not generated by Bitcoin.com wallet, or you are liar.

From my understanding it's not Ver who's killing it, but the Core devs who are crippling it intentionally.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:56:22
Your math is wrong. Even after 400% difficulty increase kicks in, Bitcoin Cash will still be the most profitable chain to mine. Not to mention Bitcoin Core is plummeting every minute.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:57:11
Did you just make up that number?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:27:01
I don't know about the devs, however, it's clear that money is leaving Core chain for Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:20:56
I'm also running a full node on AWS, and then connecting to it with SPV wallet. Can you tell me what's the advantage of running a full node on home PC? All I can think of are disadvantages (slow connection -&gt; clogging the network -&gt; slow sync time, expensive storage, etc..)
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:05:09
Cool story, bro. You've just lost the money TWICE. Bitcoin Cash is up and Bitcoin Core is down. You feel so good about your losing trade that you had to post it on reddit?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:33:27
Bitcoin is not dead. Core chain is on life support, though.
Long live Bitcoin Cash!
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:05:42
This site says 11,639. But the question is, who to trust? Core, obviously, right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:10:24
I always get included in next block for $0.001 in fees on Bitcoin Cash.
However, there's more than 140 BTC in fees up for grabs on BTC chain right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:13:16


No private keys are stored on AWS. As I said, I connect to full node with SPV wallet (Electrum). Therefore you argument is invalid.
I'm paying for my AWS instance less than it cost to make 2 transaction per month on current Bitcoin network. I'd rather pay 10€ per month to run full node on AWS than pay 5€ per transaction.

Congratulations, you've just lost 20% of your assets. Are you ready for total loss?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:05
If it's true, he just lost 30% of his stack in one day. Not sure why losing money is a good thing.
It's obvious to me that people want big blocks, and billions are moving from BTC to BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:20:00
It's not just the hashing power moving to Bitcoin Cash. It's the billions of dollars as well. Good luck with Bcore!
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:45:07
Why dump? SegWit2X has been cancelled and everyone who wants cheap transaction fees is moving towards better options. BCH have 8MB blocks and $0.01 transaction fees, meanwhile it is required for BTC to pay $10 per transaction. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see which one investors and people prefer.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:35:00
And who made the decision not to upgrade blocks to 2MB on Bcore?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:04:39
Please don't believe everything you read on the internet, and do your own research. Currently 94.5% of the miners are signaling for 2X, and therefore **bcore will only be left with 5.5% of the hashing power.**
Block to fork off from core chain is set at [494,784.](

Is it because of scaling solution, or because people no longer using it and dumping it heavily?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:34:31
ETH is scheduled to hard fork ~6 hours from now. 
Do you think there will be 2 chains after that? No, it's protocol upgrade, exactly the same as Bitcoin in November. The only difference is that Bitcoin will upgrade to 2mb blocks, and Ethereum have unlimited blocks already.
