Fair enough. The bitcoin.com news section also complained about our app's name when they wrote about Bitcoin CrazYness :)
When I got the domain name, I wasn't planning to make the app public. It was only meant to be used by a group of trader friends. Now I have to live with it.

Yes, the FOMO and Roller coaster charts are released on our beta version for Android

Hi Reddit, 
Here are some more details:
It started with a few scripts to be used by me and a group of friends, which evolved to Bitcoin CrazYness app. I tried to put any feature that I would use personally. It is currently completely **free** and has many advanced features useful for beginner and intermediate traders:
* Interactive charts with **MACD, RSI**, **Ichimoku**, **Moving Averages**, **Stochastic**, **TD Sequential**, and **Pivot Points**
* **Indicator alert** on any coin: Recurring alerts whenever indicators such as **MACD**, **RSI**, and **Ichimoku** indicate buy or Sell 
* **Limit** and **Delta** alerts on **price**, **market cap**, or **volume** for every coin
* Total Market: Delta or limit alert on **total cryptocurrency market cap**
* Personalize alerts by adding **emojis** to them: ����
* Coin tracking. True gain/loss calculation. Profit and diversity charts. CSV File import.
The app is published by a small startup company in California, USA, which I am part of. It doesn't access any of your files, passwords, or contact list. Every version is reviewed by Apple and Google before being published on App store. It doesn't run in background, and it requires minimum permissions.
I would appreciate  any feedback.
You can download it here:

What  would be the French translation of "to the moon" ?
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:03:25
No, You would not regret it then. Instead I call it FOMO level 200%.
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:11:06
What do you mean by actual and demo?
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:23:53
Yes, it's in the settings in the left side menu.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:21:47
" incredibly useful and valuable for instant, global interactions." Isn't that what really matters?
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:20:28
Thanks! Just submitted a fix :)
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:01:25

Light bulb moment: creat a new cryptocurrency that is worse than Fiat.

What is this? FUD headquarters?
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:03:55
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:32:56
I don't know about him, the market cap is too low right now, and I am not surprised that people actually invest in spreading FUD to take advantage of the results.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:18:00
We should all start using crypto the way it is meant to be used: as a currency to buy and sell things, not just for trading.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:22:25
Sorry to disappoint
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:30:53

Nice! It would be great if there was a market sentiment.

My point is that when market cap is low, it is very easy to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:38:19

Last words of a hodler: "I know you can hear me. I'm never letting you go. I can't. I just love you too damn much."
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:04:11
I agree that HODL is a complete joke

Is there any published research on how successful TA was in the last year or two for cryptocurrency? I theory one should be able to run TA on historic data and find out how often TA was truely predicted the buy/sell action.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:44:46
Yeah I understand that it would be hard for some weird patterns like cup and handle, but some of them are very clear, like MACD, RSI, Ichimoku, and Stochastic. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:24:30
All the pump and dump and fud is my fault? I'm just sitting here minding my own hodling bro.
