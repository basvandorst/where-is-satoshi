Cool. Did you see the lightning effect?
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:58:37
For some reason, the first payment in a while sometimes fails for me, but the 2nd starts working. Trying to figure out why. Its like the route isn't found the first try
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:22:08
You can also strike lightning with

Will talk with my buddies at AntPool or Slush. If they manage to mine it send it here: 3MhbM3jBvmbGyTx9oEc3Nwj5ynX6JWr3BV
Please note this is a joke, it doesn't work this way, what I did was just guess which miner will eventually pick it up. We will see which one it is. Any other bets?
edit: you could try the transaction accelerator
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:54:54
Will give it a try. May I ask which wallet generator you used previously? (from README.md).
Also, I tried https but it didn't work. Might wanna configure that :)
Y no segwit?

What he wrote down

If you need cold storage, maybe I can help. Maybe CryptoSteel is actually worth a test run because the letters are engraved in their small pieces.
Another less durable option: I 3D printed something similar to CryptoSteel. Its called CryptoPlastic, here is the link: [ . Not 100% sure how to describe it, it has like a piece holder and a bunch of pieces. Each piece has a letter engraved it in.
There are a few adjustments I would like to do to the original model as well, so lets discuss the idea a bit (if you think it is worth it). 
I can convert it to braille, just say the word.
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:34:18
What did you generate first? The image or the private key?
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:13:58
Well.. lnd offers the code. Which you used. I know its not really the same, because that is maybe more of a library..
I really don't want to sound mean, I really appreciate your effort. We need many lightning wallets. It looks good and I hope it works great. Your plan also makes sense - especially the part regarding gaining some reputation first.
However, I stand by what I said: I hope I will be able to try it and built it myself one day
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:44:37
I am having some trouble finding the source code. Is it available?
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:35:41
looks cool is there 1 btc hidden in it?
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:51:29
My personal opinion: especially in this early stages of lightning, we need to help it grow as healthy as possible. A non free software/closed source wallet is not the way to go.
The UI seems nice, but sadly, I won't be able to try it because of this.
Good luck and I really hope I will be able to build it myself one day.

Except the attachment size limit. Now attachments are sent "off chain"
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:17:20
Send all your coins to an address with a really small fee, something like 3-4 satoshi per byte. Send from the new address with a really high fee, something which will prob get in the next block.
 - 300 satoshi per byte should get you there (might even be too much, but maybe it is worth it).
For the miners to pickup the high satoshi per byte transaction, they would have to also pick up the low ones. Did this when I wanted to merge in a single address.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:52:12
Nope because of Merkle Trees. Check out some videos about this.
Edit: The idea is to get all your fragmented coins in a single transaction using low fees (which maybe won't confirm due to low fee), but create a single transaction from that point with a high fee. The high fee transaction would be far less bytes because it was "merged" previously. Hope this makes sense.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:27:09
I am so happy I finally get to build this. Thank you so much, going to try it and provide feedback.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:50:17
Yup. I also really like the concept of checking/savings account.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:23:59
Lets try this:
plz send some testnet coins
Edit: ok, I need to sync
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:28:55
It doesn't show an address because it is still syncing to Chain. Will post again when it is done.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:23:44
Thanks for working on a wallet, the ecosystem needs more open source wallets. Will give it a try.
Since coinomi is not actually open source, I started working on my own wallet as well.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:55:02
Most businesses care about one thing only. Withdraw your coins, send them a support message saying you will rejoin if they support what you want and delete your account.
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:53:10
Do you also see 2 long strings below the QR codes? Under "Load &amp; Verify" it should be similar to `1NFQie13KBeLsAzoNDELamZUwgXmSrS5Gw` and under "Spend" it should be similar to `5Kkx4zTrbAtUQTygqsX5RJz6fXMJzpfhwzY92STcSsMj2EPe4RG`. (not the same characters, but similar in length for example).
If this is the case you can go to 
What ever you do, don't share the string below "Spend", that is the private key. You can put that in most wallets (mobile for example and you will be able to spend it). Just look for `sweep paper wallet` feature.

 - all contributors + links to mailing list, slack, irc, irc logs
 - ongoing stuff
 - mailing list
At a personal level, I like that I have access to all these resources. It is a transparent open source process.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:02:42
Wow, really cool, will try it! Nice to get a long awaited feature.
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:09:43
If you can program something to monitor the bitcoin price you can also program it to remotely toggle mining automagically.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:35:50
haha yea
fixing typo thx
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:50:53
Yea, after seeing so many positive reviews and an option to buy with Trezor, I highly doubt something wrong will happen.
It seemed odd that they don't answer to support inquiries but I am not worried.
I will assume they are too busy building wallets (hooray).
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:40:06
This comment assumes you researched the laws in the country you live in regarding selling/buying bitcoin (example: pay taxes if there are any).
Selling is pretty easy. Find someone who wants to buy and just sell it. A website in which you can sell bitcoin to other users will probably take a fee.

Hello here is the link to the service:  (if you are not interested in the blog post explaining how it works)
@_date: 2017-07-08 22:48:49
If you are so impatient, try  . Just don't keep it near fire, keep the same paper info if you need it like you say. Note, I don't recommend it over Cryptosteel, I recommend it UNTIL you get your Cryptosteel.
Your Cryptosteel will arrive, they are a good company with a good product.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:15:13
Instead of cloud mining I recommend you spend a fixed amount of fiat to buy bitcoin every 2 weeks. For example 20$ every 2 weeks.
Cloud mining is a bet. The most reliable companies offer slow ROI, more profitable ones have a high risk of being scams.
If you purchase some amount of cloud hashes, keep in mind that over time, you will get less return due to difficulty increase.
Some rules which I don't think you should omit for cloud mining.
1. Never invest in a cloud mining company if they don't show pictures of their hardware.
2. Look for ASIC endorsement. Hardware vendors provide these to cloud miners.
3. Huge discounts or free hash power is a no-no.
4. Look for transparency. If they are hiding their identities, look somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:13:41
Yea that even got a mention in the blog post :) Maybe I should have posted an image of that as well.
Regarding fees.. I considered a few coins (example: dogecoin - due to small fees). I am planning to support other cryptos as well.. Just not sure which ones. Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:38:18
hm.. will check valid ranges. thx
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:33:14
Only doing dirty deeds done dirty cheap with a person can bitcoin-level trust be achieved. This was a happy little accident, carry on
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:12:36
yea. around 200$
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:57:18
I also ordered cryptosteel, waiting for mine to arrive.
Until they arrive, I made [cryptoplastic](
I do not recommend this over the cryptosteel, but if you don't have it or can't afford it, it might be a good option.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:10:03
Ok I want a crack at this but I am not sure how P2SH works. Can you please tell me how I can make a "try"?
Where do I need to submit input or which RPC call do I need to make?
I am not asking for a clue, I am asking for how to make a "test" for such a transaction. How do I know if it worked? Hope my questions make sense.
edit: I imagine I would first try to brute force it, if that is an option.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:40:24
Yes, CryptoSteel is way better than this in terms of security.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:24:03
As other people in the thread pointed out, the fee is super low. It could be picked up (means it confirms), it could be dropped (in 2 weeks I think, some wallets rebroadcast)
There is however hope: Send all the bitcoin to another address you control with a very high fee. For the high fee transaction to be picked up, the small fee transaction needs to be picked up first.
If you know and thrust the person who sent you bitcoin, it could also be an option to wait it out. It could eventually confirm, especially since before 1st August, fewer transactions will happen due to uncertainty.
