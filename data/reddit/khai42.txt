Block of previous halving (block reward = 25 BTC; 2012-11-28)

Next block halving will occur at block height = 210000 x 2 = 420000.

I have been using Coinbase for over a year with a linked US bank account.  No issues.  Just keep in mind that they are not an exchange, which means that your buy/sell orders may not be instant.  Also, they are not a bank and, therefore, not insured.  However, they are US based and fully compliant on all laws and regulations.
Yes, you can send the funds (assuming you mean bitcoins) to your wallet on your local computer.  In fact, you can send them to any other wallet including, for example, Blockchain.info.

The fee is not necessary.  A higher fee increases the likelihood of your transaction getting on the blockchain sooner.  If you are not in a hurry, a zero fee is fine.  
For example, a few months ago, someone sent $100M+ in bitcoins from one address to another with no fee.

Also, who drives the speed limit?  Imagine a scenario in which a police car is on the side of the road with a speed detector.

Previous reports and statements that Coinbase is a scam is a result of some of their policies to buy/sell bitcoins compared to customer expectations.  Coinbase is a US-based company, fully compliant with money rules and regulations.  However, they are not an exchange nor a bank.
* Not an exchange: Do not expect instant buy/sell of bitcoins.  
* Not a bank: Your deposits are not insured.
I have been using Coinbase for over a year now with few issues.  I highly recommend them.  I have setup a dozen accounts for friends and family on Coinbase.
Now, as far as keeping $6K in Coinbase depends on the alternatives available to you.  If you are tech savvy, only keep a little bit there and the rest in cold storage.  If you are not comfortable with keep $6K in your possession and safeguarding it yourself, Coinbase may be the better choice for you.
Another option is to keep some of it at Blockchain.info to spread your risk.  Buy at Coinbase.  Send some bitcoins to Blockchain.  (Careful not to click the Ad on Google for Blockchain.)

I am in the US.  I have my bitcoins in both Coinbase vault and in cold storage (offline wallets) that I manage.  Yes, I agree that offline wallets are a hassle.  But I also trust Coinbase enough to store some bitcoins there.  No, they do not have insurance, but I do not insure my offline wallets either.
With Circle coming out with 0.5% fee and insurance, I think Coinbase will eventually need to do something similar to compete.

This is awesome indeed.
To those of you bringing profit to this thread, think about all the kids out there running lemondade stands.  Are they really making a profit?  From their point of view "yes" because all their equipment costs are free (from Mon/Dad).
So, if I were a 13 yr old, mining would profitable for me because the computer is free.  The electricity has been paid for.  So, anything I mine is pure profit for me.
So--Great job Dad/Mom for teaching your son about bitcoins in such a way that it got through.

Are you thinking about this now because the price is going up?  Did you consider this option while the prices were going down?
Here is another option for you to consider.
* Keep the $22K in the 401K to avoid the penalty and tax implications.
* Stop contributing to the 401K.  Invest these future 401K contributions to buy bitcoin instead.  You would be dollar-cost averaging.

Let's assume you are in the US.
1. Yes, legal.  Several US agencies (IRS, FinCEN, etc.) have even sent out guidelines.  
2. I recommend Coinbase.  They are fully compliant and follow all US laws and regulations. Also, check the "Getting Started" link on the sidebar but double-check via Google to make sure sites posted on Wiki's have not been phished.
3. Overstock, TigerDirect, Gyft, Coinmap.org
4. No, but for beginners, the easiest way is to buy with real money from an exchange (none in the US) or broker (Coinbase).  If you sell or work for bitcoins, you will need a Bitcoin wallet.

I agree.  Coinbase vaults are a good option for US citizens (maybe others too, not sure). They follow current US and California laws and regulations, i.e. we have recourse of they disappear.  
No, they are not federally insured like banks and traditional brokerages, but neither are mutual fund companies like Vanguard and Fidelity.

Hi Olaf, one request if you ever decide to release your own iOS app:
* Please do not show the user's balance when they are paying/sending bitcoins.  
* When I am buying things with bitcoins in person, the merchant or bystanders can easily see my Coinbase balance.  
* Please hide the balance but optionally show it if the user needs to see the balance.

* Coinbase allows automatic recurring purchases.  (And auto replenish but I have not used that feature yet.)
* When I buy, say, 0.01 bitcoins on Circle, sometimes I get 0.01 bitcoins but other times I get 0.00999934 or some other weird number (due to round-off errors?).  On Coinbase, I have always gotten 0.01 bitcoins.

I agree.  The phrase "10 bitcoin days destroyed" is totally confusing.
1. If this is a unit of measurement, it needs a hyphen.  For example, it is not "10 foot pounds" but "10 foot-pounds."  So, the unit of measurement should be "10 bitcoin-days."
2. Need to add either "stale" or "idle" to the phrase to make it more descriptive.

Let's give some kudos to the interviewer, Liz Lumley, too.  She asked decent, intelligent, and interesting questions.

Yeah, whatever.  You and the rest of the world go on ahead with your powers of ten stuff.  We in the good ol' USA will stick to our own system.

I have the same question myself.  I could not find anything on their website stating that they guarantee the private key?  In any case, I did buy a few wallet-cards, deposited some mB, and gave the cards away to friends and family.  It was a great way to introduce others to Bitcoins.
