Sure the average American doesn't really read, but anyone who is running a business does.  Its more important to get those people exited about bitcoin than the average Joe.

Except for the fact that we paid for them?


So how are you magically going to get back the money that was invested by tax payers into the internet infrastructure?
I know its hard for you guys to accept but the free market doesn't work with infrastructure.

Thanks, didn't feel like enabling javascript for some random news site.

I did not say they were equal, I said net neutrality and laws protecting discrimination have similar purposes which is true.

I always feel out of place in the bitcoin community as a moderate liberal....

The same is true of physical media. I don't see any downfalls to this system that aren't present in physical media as well.

I use no script, along with other Firefox add-ons to take back a little bit of my privacy.

Well Google *is* the king of search. I would assume that he could easily find anything on the internet.

Money, bribes, protecting the status quo, protecting the US dollar because that is how they get their subsidies etc.

Hardly, Net neutrality is about equal treatment of packets on the internet, much how the Bill of Rights, 14th Amendment, Civil Rights act, guarantee the rights of the people.
Are you opposed to the Bill of Rights? Do you really think that segregation in this country would have ended without the 14th amendment and the Civil Rights Act?
Oh, and let us not forget about the massive amount of money ISP's accept from the government while also having local monopolies in most areas.

If you're looking for an off contract, cheap but high quality phone look into the moto G. No bloatware, quad core cpu, 1 gig of ram, $180 for 8 GB, $200 for 16 GB. 
The only downside is no LTE but it does support HSPA+ and that is fast enough for me.
If you don't use a lot of minutes it works perfectly on the $30 Tmobile plan.

It's also closed source and controlled. Just like ios.

You know the point of democracy is that you don't have to revolt over every problem....

It is very relevant to bicoin. Now ISP could degrade or even block any type of bitcoin internet traffic, blockchain, mining etc.
This puts the whole system in danger.

They already sell this box on sites like Ali express.
The FBI had nothing to do with this...

It's stuff like this that really makes me love Reddit. Not only offering a the option of Bitcoin payment, but discounting it as well.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:43:44
We call that history

Nope, the FCC could implement Net Neutrality today if they reclassified Internet Service Providers to Common Carriers. This is well within the powers of the Executive branch.
And it wasn't the Supreme Court either....

Not a question but a suggestion: many subreddits have these type of "noob question" posts weekly, is one of them  imo they've and very successful.
 I think it would be great to have one of these posts once a week, say every Monday or something. I believe has a bot that auto makes the post each week so it's not a burden on the mods.
People are never going to even try Bitcoin if they are shamed away before they even get the chance.

It may not be in "mainstream" use but its become a pretty "mainstream" idea that a majority of people have heard of by now.

Check out kiva.org, you can give out loans to people in the developing world.

So, it looks like they're basically shut down at this point... Any other viable options?
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:55:02
The day Wikipedia accepts Bitcoins they get $20 from me.
Until then I can't be bothered.
