Wow. Do we really need that sentence in a bill? First off because it's bullshit. Goldman Sachs is above the law as are all the big banks.

Goldman Sachs (reported) net revenue in 2015 was $6.08 billion. I think they can handle the slap on the wrist seeing as how they've been around since 1869 and have probably amassed a fortune so large Scrooge McDuck could swim in it.

From that sentence alone I can guarantee you are the guy that everyone here is saying you are.

Have you considered that LocalBitcoin is lying? Why side with a business by default instead of just not siding with anyone?
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:09:54
Reason? Or are you just saying this because it's down?

So is 0.0001 no longer the standard rate for fees?
@_date: 2016-12-06 06:35:57
This looks cool but I'm not sure what I'm looking at. So where it says "before your tx" I need to wait until that number reaches 0 then my transaction happens?

I did the accelerator and it said "jumped succeed" or something similar but still nothing for my transaction in my wallet.
I didn't get any change back. It was a full wallet transfer.

How would I do that if my coins have already been sent? My balance is 0 in my currently wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-06 06:33:41
According to Blockchain.info my transaction is still unconfirmed and pending. I do have my wallet backed up. The coins were removed from my wallet balance. Payments window says "Sending".
@_date: 2016-12-06 07:04:37
Is there any way I can cancel and redo the transaction with an increased fee or am I SOL and I just need to wait it out?
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:14:13
So then why doesn't Multibit provide this information to you when making your transaction? Why doesn't it say "Default fee for this transaction is $$$$, please enter your requested fee here:"
They want this technology to catch on but it won't with all of these "gotcha" problems with fees and transaction. Yeah, I'm dumb for not knowing I should have paid more, but the program really should tell you this when performing the transaction.

Block PM's from users with accounts &lt; 1 day old. Yours is probably better.

I used the wrong sign by mistake. Fixed.

Fuck you with a rusty hammer.

It's a generalization and emotional description of something that does happen but not as often as these types of people would like you to believe. It's like the Black Lives Matter crowd. They lump all law enforcement into one.
