ITT: The very reason why the price is low
@_date: 2014-08-28 09:16:48
To your point. Sure some buy back the coins, but looking at the price action currently, most probably don't, at least for now.
 As for merchants who accept Bitcoin, it would be cool to see them at least partially promise to keep some of it in 
Bitcoin. At the moment every coin used to buy stuff exits to the fiat market. There's no problem though as the more you can buy with bitcoin the better. It's just the article is pointing out an interesting effect on the price. Doesn't seem very intuitive at first that it would pressure it down.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:51:04
How do you imagine an decentralized exchange is going to work? As long as you use fiat to buy anything there is going to be government regulation. If it is anonymous it will be closed.
I totally understand your standpoint on the people that lost their money, but that is exactly the mentally that drives greed. Greedy people can't have a nice community

That's just another version of a centralized exchange.. as long as they need to complete it at an exchange. In theory if they could do the transactions from peer to peer between fiat and BTC it would work, but then governments will take action against them because of money laundering and shadow economy.
The governments own fiat, not the people

I also switched to electrum. And I must say I recommend them now over multibit. The 12 word seed is a nice touch, also the setup forces you go through the all-so important security steps and leaves nothing unexplained. Also you have option to choose your fees. Feels more complete and secure overall

This is true for not just amazon but for so many companies handling tons of transactions on a daily basis. I don't get why have they been so careful to not use Bitcoin. They'd stand to gain a comfortable margin increase by cutting down on transaction costs.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:15:56
This could also be deliberate, to pump up the volume, because when they should come back online everybody will want to have those cheap coins. Afterall they make their cut on the transactions

There is no way a guy like Buffet can even begin to understand what bitcoin really is. The guy is 83 years old. He was in his 50s when talks about internet came along. Usually by the time you are 50 you stop learning and start remembering more about the past. It's just how the brain works. Bitcoin is about 20 levels more complicated to understand than the internet, so it should be techincally impossible for him to understand it

@_date: 2014-01-14 14:30:44
I was mainly implying that, take the bitcoins and don't convert them into dollars. Convince the suppliers to accept coins too, security wise bitcoin is pretty well off, each transaction is always available to account and recount, isn't this the whole beauty of the Bitcoin, that you don't need any middlemen?
@_date: 2014-08-28 10:39:38
you bring out a good point, there's little incentive for suppliers holding coins. Unless workers would like to get payed in coin, I suppose

When quantum processors hit the the world, Bitcoin is the least lucrative thing to crack. All of the worlds crypto will be at risk.
