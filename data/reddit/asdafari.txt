2 months downward trend
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:33:25
No but the mentality that, as long as you hodl and don't sell, you haven't made a mistake is both childish and stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:12:25
You still made a bad trade even if you haven't realized it. Could have put into into other things that grew that time period. I am bearish on crypto in the 3 months time period. For the last 2 months support levels have just gone lower and lower.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:08:28
You only say that because they are worth a lot now. You would not have been happy with some failed project crypto or monopoly money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:10:13
I have maybe 15-20, all buys tho.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:29:14
Low fees and has an actual use by companies right now? BTC needs to get lightning out before it is too late.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:32:01
There is no reason to use LBC, pretty much when the alternatives save you a bunch in fees. I used to use their website before but luckily have stopped.

Yea, and all transactions that wallet has ever sent and received and to which wallets. Everything is open.
Edit: By sender I thought he meant address, of course a sender can have many addresses and they don't have to be linked anyhow. Every transaction and where it goes is open though which is what's important to understand.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:08:30
Top ten coins only. This sub is crazy in that it only thinks BTC is real and can succeed.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:54:40
This can be traced AS easily as how much is in the sender wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:42:11
There have been these posts since 15k
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:21:25
Pretty much all shares are centralized today, doesn't mean they are scams. Was Microsoft, Apple, Google etc. a bad investment just because a few people owned a lot?
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:35:53
I wouldn't do it for my main but for some stunt like this where you transfer the BTC after it is better
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:45:35
Lightning is still not usable for large scale money laundering. The tech is too early to even use reliably for small transactions right now.
@_date: 2019-11-10 08:47:01
Nah, come on... There are websites and tools you can use to create a vanity address. Vanitygen is from 2011 for example. Noone sits there randomly just creating them until they get the correct address.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:00:15
Ppl thought 13k was the time to buy too. I say it will go down to 2k before going up again.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:55:58
You are just talking out of your ass. If you could predict price you wouldn't post on Reddit
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:11:07


You seem to think that the mining pools are made up of mostly private individuals like yourself, i.e. "normal people". There is no way that is the case, imo. It is dominated by wealthy individuals that own millions/billions. I think most of these people are Chinese. There are many people with crazy amounts of money there. There was a cool documentary on Youtube on this from like 2013 with some Businessmen that showed their set-up, it was all very secretive though in regards to location etc.

Don't hold your breath

Anyone can pass a lie detector test with training. There is a great podcast on this on TAL from an ex CIA lie detector instructor. He made a lot of money teaching ppl how to lie on the side basically.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:13:05
2 months ago u literally said that at that time is the best time to buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:08:58
Yea lol, not true your other comment.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:41:15
What recovery?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:26:12
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:02:19
From 26 to 23 DOW went down. BTC from 20 to 6.3, my statement is right and you just look delusional/misinformed.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:36:14
That's what ppl said about feb and mar in Dec/Jan
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:32
1000, no joke.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:12:02
You must be delusional if you think BTC price will increase. Support levels just getting lower and lower for like 10 weeks straight.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:57:03
It is dipping so fast there is no way it will stop at 10k imo.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:30:23
Cryptos move together more than stocks tho.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:37:49
It is different now though that BTC is in the spotlight after those crazy gains 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:41:08
They don't want ppl to put money into crypto that would otherwise go to stocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:13:37
This time is different since ppl know about BTC now. NASDAQ took 13 YEARS to recover from the 00 valuation/bubble. BTC is not recovering soon.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:34:25
Zoom out
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:01
I didn't write anything wrong. Looks like 5k might happen sooner than 1 month even. We are now soon at 6k. The guy above me didn't believe me and he now deleted his comment to not look like a fool. Not all individual stocks recover, some never do. I think BTC will be one of those.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:11:02
It briefly touched 19-20k and since then every week has been lower than the one before pretty much. I expect price to go down to 5k within 1 month.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:59:25
Lol no
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:12:11
What app is that? looks to show everything relevant.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:56:56
He probably meant debit card. I am Swedish and banks wont give them to teenagers lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:10:34
First 8 weeks downwards and then 1 week upwards and you talk about steady?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:10
Not going away? The world would be literally the same since BTC has no practical use today. Before it was only seen as a store of value, doubt anyone can say that now
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:41:48
Lol he accepts all cryptos. In bitcoin subreddit title is he accepts BTC and in ETH it is he accepts ETH ��
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:41:27
I made 30k last week. Get on my level... Anyone can just throw out numbers...
