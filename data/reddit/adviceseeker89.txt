Granted this might not be individual users, but, if Coinbase has this many users, worldwide, the number of bitcoin users may be approaching 20 million. Pretty good stuff!

" That's because, in addition to the limited reach it found, the survey's  results also show that the primary reason people invest in  cryptocurrencies is the possibility of a huge return -- not because they  necessary think digital currencies are the future of money. "
They're not wrong, I do think there will be a huge return.  The reason I think there will be a huge return is that digital currencies are the future of money.

My problem with Schiff, when it comes to btc, is his constant"versus gold" arguments. If we all agree fiat should be replaced, why can't there be gold and bitcoin? Why is it always either or. Same with etherum for that matter.

I was going to write a comment exactly like this one about Novogratz comment.  Awesome thought. Imagine if everyone can afford to live a decent life by just living/being willing to provide their data.  This would afford everyone the time to pursue passions and really open up the innovative force of humans.

My point was more that the USD didn't just have a 50X+ run, then drop 80%.  If USD dropped 80%from its levels more,  that would destroy it. BTC can,  not definitely,  but can survive it's 80% drop

Why am I up 10X in less than 5 years on my BTC investment?
