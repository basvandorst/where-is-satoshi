Must be kosher or Halal slaughter because they are cutting the throat of the animal to kill it, also not in a western country most likely because they still stun then with a bolt to the head.
Still tasty though

and if theres a massive correction down to $1200? Now OP can't pay for his/her house. You have drunk some serious cool aid, your statement is not a rational one to make, lock in the gains to an acceptable level and leave what you are willing to continue to SPECULATE with.

Just because you believe in Bitcoin doesn't give you a reasonable excuse to not make sound financial decisions. Buying a house and owning the title dead outright in Australia puts you ahead massively, because your investments can go to 0 but you still have a place to live.

Again you lack understand of what blockchain as a technology is. You also labour under the delusion that blockchain will replace fiat currency, which will never occur. 
At most physical cash will disappear and you'll pay with a government backed electronic account no different to tap and pay tech that is already makes up the majority of transactions in some countries.

So you just ignored the perfect example I gave, I don't you really understand what Blockchain is

You are forgetting corporate or Government blockchains (ie. Distributed databases) that they would run and validate themselves. For example the Australian Stock Exchange is moving away from CHESS (ASX system for tracking share ownership to the individual) to a blockchain based solution to track share ownership.

You use the recovery seed to open it using other software or another trezor or supported device.

Bitcoin acts more like Gold than Fiat currency is this regard.
