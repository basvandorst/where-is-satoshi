Are you looking for US based/focused startups or worldwide?

Another vote for copay

What about BitPay?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:14:32
Thanks (again) last question: Just our of curiosity, how would I know if my seed was affected? ie part of the ~2%
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:33:50
I can vouch for Luno! Great exchange and amazing customer support :)
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:04:41
Thanks for the reply. So what do we do? Move our funds to another wallet while we wait for a fix and then regen our seeds?
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:51:35
Sorry for your loss :(
It's up to you and your family what you do with the BTC you've recovered. I'm sure medical expenses could be resolved if you sold some of them. 
I'd personally honor your brothers foresight by keeping at least 21 in his name. Hold/sell the rest as needed.
Again, sorry for your loss.

ROFL... Have you seen some of the comments?

Even if its just for marketing purposes, its a better sign when a company looks at all their portals in a secure light.

I saw this last week someplace (signed up to check it out) but how are you doing copyright checking? In most of the categories I looked at it seems that people are just ripping content from other websites/content creators and uploading them?
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:52:56
Not 100% sure on the ATMS but I recently found an old wallet of mines keys and moved the funds out of the block chain wallet they were in and it took like 16hrs to move to my copay wallet. Most transactions I do off my local exchange reflect in 0-2min so perhaps it's something relating to the blockchain.info wallet? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:49:40
Its USSD based and tho the cellservices and banks still take a cut its very cheap and allows for the unbanked to "bank" via their cellphones/airtime and pay for any services face2face. its pretty awesome.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:22:02
Any idea as to what time the announcement would be? like 9am? or is it more like lunchtime?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:03:46
Thanks for the feedback. As long as we dont need to move things around or generate new seeds I'm happy :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:53:10
I mined a lot back in the day off my shitty old dell laptop, spent quite a few when they were worth &gt;US$0.20 each on music, buying games, playing random poker websites etc.
I recently dug out the old laptop (after tracking down a replacement charger) to see if there was anything left in the wallets. After downloading the blockchain the wallets had nothing but regrets in their transaction history...
35BTC here (random album purchase), 10BTC there (random gambling site) etc etc.

I use Payfast on a couple of ecommerce sites I run and have accepted BTC payments on a couple of orders. TBF not 1000s of orders but its still a nice feature to have :)
@_date: 2012-07-13 15:52:03
Well there needs to be some disincentive to thieves. If they are unique and traceable, why is having some official reporting function that allows you to report coins as being stolen.
Sorry just trying to understand the downside to this.
@_date: 2012-09-18 10:51:25
Wow thats quite an investment :) Best of luck and thanks for the info.
@_date: 2012-04-26 21:31:56
Yep made it a few weeks ago.
So whats the plan batman? Do I need to make a new one?
@_date: 2012-04-26 20:05:03
OK someone please tell me what Im failing at here :-/
Ive got a wallet / account on blockchain.info but when I try pair my device (iphone 4) with the QR code it just says "Password is too short and must be 10char" ... why does the site not have the same requirements? 
I is confused :(
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:16:16
Dammit! :P ty corrected
@_date: 2012-07-13 16:06:14
Well the best (please note this is talking off the top of my head) way to do this is to report the theft to a local police station to get a case number.
Using that case number a ticket is sent to some foundation that manages this sort of thing (prob need to be created for this) and they verify it and taint the coins in a global db.
obviously its more complicated than that with the ability to spend coins, but ideas down that path are needed no?
@_date: 2012-04-27 09:03:39
You Sir, are a scholar and a gentalman.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2012-03-22 15:13:53
@_date: 2012-07-13 15:29:14
Random Question: Since coins can be 'traced' via block chain, why can't we tag those stolen coins as 'tainted' and the network disallows tainted coins to be used?
EDIT: Wow thanks for all the sarcastic responses and downvotes :-/ I now understand that centralizing or 'governing' any section of the Bitcoin network would cause issues with the flow and structure of it.
@_date: 2012-09-18 10:51:02
Thanks, never heard of Electrum. I'll chekc it out
@_date: 2012-09-17 15:25:31
Thanks for the link/info

You should check out airbornemusic.com Its not bitcoin based but they allow the artist to make a nice cut of the sales...and fans can download in FLAC if they want which is awesome
@_date: 2012-06-22 14:08:25
Technically its BRICS (for South Africa)
But I'd laugh if anyone here would use it. I know about 15 people that even know what it is :-/ TIA
EDIT: Typo
@_date: 2012-07-13 16:35:51
Fair enough. Thank you
@_date: 2012-09-17 15:05:05
Thanks! I do like their security and automated 'offsite' backup options
@_date: 2012-08-01 10:07:26
TY for the coin :)
I prefer Google Authenticator (I dislike 3rd party ones)
I also prefer (as mentioned elsewhere) the block chain style backups/encryption.
Finally, it would be great to be able to create multiple wallets.
Otherwise I like the site. Will keep my btc in that wallet and see how it goes :)
@_date: 2012-07-13 16:36:00
understood. ty

you learnt a lot tho about how it worked and its potential so that something :P (Im in same boat)
@_date: 2011-08-15 12:35:46
thanks for the reply. that make sense. I didnt see that onsite so it might be something to add to the FAQ :)
@_date: 2011-08-15 07:46:24
thanks for the reply. No offence, but is there any sort of public validation or 'appeal' ? 
Just wondering how you settle disputes.
@_date: 2011-08-14 22:27:09
How does verification work? Is it done by a Mod or the community?
Cool Idea
@_date: 2011-09-24 11:50:11
I didnt have a previous install but for fresh installs yes. I would ask an expert though if you havnt got  recent backup of your wallet file.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:55:27
Check out exodus.io
Been using it the last couple of weeks its pretty painless and a slick little app!

I've been using it for a couple of months and I really like it.
Their slack community is very helpful and the devs are keen to assist.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:41:02
Good on you man. Glad BTC helped you out!
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:23:11
totally depends on how secure you google password is and who has access to your machine/drive.
I recommend a paper wallet for that. or you can setup blockchain.info to be 'read only' on your main wallet so you can use their interface to see how much is in there but cant make payments from it.

We're dealing with something very similar in South Africa at the moment. 
They're calling it PIPCOIN or PIPCHAIN. We're busy [discussing]( just how to go about exposing it over in @_date: 2013-11-03 17:15:21
You and should hook up
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:18:50
the tip bot flips a coin and awards you with either $0.25 or $0.50

Somewhat related:
About 3-4 weeks ago I was going to sell off one of my DotA2 couriers (a unique TI2 drop item) It was to be my first real money trade for an item. I had previously traded items for items with friends etc but never for real money. 
The item is/was getting offers of $600-$700 on dota2lounge.com I decided that was within the price range that I would accept and decided to open communications with a couple of the traders. Most wanted to do paypal, so I went to the bank to get my paypal activated. This took ages (only now 5weeks later becoming active) so I decided to place a bitcoin price on it. 
Most of the traders fell away because they didnt have the 9BTC I wanted for the item. Except this one guy. Started chatting with him. Agreed on the item price and he asked for a day so he could put together the last 2BTC he needed for the transaction. During this process another trader contacted me and said he was interested in the item. I informed him that I was in the process of negotiations for the item for 9BTC. He offered me 10BTC for the item as a boyout.
My greed spiked and I decided to go with him. He suggested we use a middle man for the trade from the dota2traders website. I agreed and (here is my fail) asked him which trader. He linked me to the owners profile. It looked correct but only on closer inspection did I notice the name had a "," and not a "." like the legit owner.
Long story short, I shared my BTC address with him and moved the item to the middle man. 10sec later they both went offline and that was that.
The kicking myself comes in now every day that I see BTC climbing higher and higher. If I hadnt been greedy for that extra 1BTC I would have had 9BTC and been smiling. Im now out the item and the BTC.
I learnt a lot that day about how to correctly trade items online (and check account profiles against known scammers) and will never make that mistake again. Lesson learnt.
TL;DR Im a dumbass

Question: as a fellow Saffer, where are you exchanging your coins? and 2nd to that, if you are buying where are you buying from?
Im having a real issue purchasing from some of the more established exchanges and the people listed on localbitcoins.com seem dodgy as fuck
ps. wp and gl!
