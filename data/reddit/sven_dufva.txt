Can you give a source for the claim that the murder charges were dropped? 
According to The Baltimore Sun he is facing 2 court cases, 1 in Maryland and another in New York. [(source)](
In Maryland he is charged with " conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and attempted witness murder" and other charges.
In New York he is charged with "one count for narcotics conspiracy, one count of running a criminal enterprise, one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and one count of money laundering" and whatnot. [(source)](

If you follow the links on the blog post, the only source for "murder charge has been dropped" is another blog, this one made by Ulbricht's sister.
The problem is that Ulbricht's sister was with him in the New York hearing in 02.04.2014
But as we all know, he was already charged in Maryland on 10.01.2013.
You can read the [Maryland charges here(PDF)]( The murder charge is under "Count Two".

Their facebook message reads "hook up with your very own Bitcoin millionaire ! In this party the next generation of maizekings (**I swear to god thats what it says, I dont know why, possibly a reference to something**) plan their world domination"
So yeah its a pretty safe bet that there will be no actual women present.
I can see this event drawing decent number of people, simply because you don't have to pay to get in (super rare in Finnish bar scene) and they promise free drink(s).

IRS is not going to believe him. "I lost them" is not a valid excuse and will result in him being buttfucked by IRS.

China is not "flip-flopping". They announced long time ago that Bitcoin would be "banned" and gave traders several weeks to sell their Bitcoins and get out.
After Bitcoin was "banned", several traders tried to keep trading Bitcoins by being clever and playing games. PBOC then dropped the hammer and told them to stop it.

The OP has over 120k Bitcoins.
He lost 500 of those.  He doesn't care.

I would assume that USA government and Icelandic government have a standard "We will assist each other in criminal investigations, as long as standard bureaucratic forms have been properly filed."

I like how the "source" for this story is an anonymous redditor. And the  response in the original thread from Bitcoin community was "You are so full of shit and this is fake".
But yeah, clearly revolution is right around the corner.

You are aware that "japs" is a derogatory WW2 era term for Japanese right?
And you are also aware that Japanese people / Government had nothing to do with the dysfunctional fuckery that was Mt.Gox ?

Why wont you admit that you regularly enjoy beating your wife during one of your frequent alcoholic binges ? 
I have it on a good authority (your neighbor Bob) that you would never admit to it, so clearly your denial is just another piece of evidence of your true violent nature.

So you can not explain the connection between In-Q-Tel and Henry Fords racist views on jews, despite the fact that you were the first to bring it up, so you resort to childish name calling and hope that one one notices ?

How could you NOT know that US is viewed as a superpower and economic backbone of the Western world? For Christ sake people.

Dude, this is money laundering. The fact that he is not willing to personally buy the Bitcoins, but is instead using you and your parents bank account should be your sign to back off from this "deal".
For christ sake you are asking random people on the internet what your cover story should be in case the bank / police ask you about the mystery money.
Bottom line, your parents bank account will be flagged, the bank will call the cops and the police will not buy your "Im just buying them for friend of my friend, nothing illegal is going on. No I'm not in anyway benefiting financially from this arrangement".

I stand corrected and it makes more sense.

I hate to be Captain Buzzkill but if the "government" really wanted your Bitcoins, what is stopping them from simply sending you to jail until you hand them over?

You should know that despite losing his MtGox Bitcoins, OP still has over 124k Bitcoins.
There is a reason he is speaking so strongly against regulation and why is trying to hype people to keep buying Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:29:53
Do you mean he cant be prosecuted in federal court and state court at the same time ? 
Because you can charge person with multiple of crimes and have one trial.

user name "hightimes". Asking questions on client - attorney privilege. Worried that if IRS digs too deep, they might find something "iffy" about his finances not related to Bitcoin. US citizen, currently in Mexico.
Needless to say, he might be involved in something more illegal then just filing false tax reports.

I suppose I am less of a "troll" and more of a "lurker". I like to read but I rarely upvote / downvote or comment. I think Bitcoin is interesting idea, but I do not own any and I dont see my self owning due to several reasons:
1.The Politics.
Bitcoin community is filled with libertarians/Anarcho-capitalists who seek to start a revolution and smash the "oppressive" state, more specifically the United States of America and replace it with utopia. Sure they often talk about "global revolution", but every problem of a "typical nation state" is usually reference to stuff that happens in USA.
The problem is that I am not an american. I live in Finland. We have a high standard of living, we have very little corruption,  strong social net and after years of voting and protesting we also have strong workers rights. Things like Walmart could never exist in Finland. There are not "Take a massive loan for college and spend the next 30 years paying for it".
In short I am not interested in your revolution. 
2.Currency, Investment Or a Gambling?
Bitcoin is supposed to be a "currency". Something that you can use to for example to buy milk at the super market.
Yet by large the community treats it as a investment. When the price peaked at 1k, I saw many comments how the price could only go up, "10k in few months !" "To the moon !!" "Man people are so going to be jelly because they werent brave enough to buy now :) "
No one explained the reason why Bitcoins price should go up. It was simply going "to the moon !" and you were not allowed to question it, all who advised caution were downvoted to the ground for being "shills" and "trolls".
Great many people on this sub treat bitcoin as a investment, yet their behavior is more like a gambling addict. 
3.Delusions of Grandeur + Paranoid community
As outside observer who reads this sub daily, the community seems very paranoid. This sub is supposed to be about "general financial news" yet conspiracy posts are almost daily voted to the top. 
Which institution is "oppressing" the Bitcoin community today ? Is it the FBI ? NSA ? ATF ? IRS ? Central bank ? Perhaps the omnipotent "Government" ? That's easy to know, just open up and and you will find your answer. Which ever institution is "the flavor of the day" is also directly responsible for the price of Bitcoin falling.
English is not my first language, so I apologize if my post is hard to read.

Do you not feel that current value of bitcoin is relevant information that people should be aware before they invest in it ?

Well he did contact a person who he thought was a contract killer, payed him money to kill people and when he was presented "evidence" of kills (in form of staged photos of the victims) he said something along the lines of "well it had to be done, how soon can you kill the next one ?".
According to USA law the act of negotiating payment for "hitman" is enough for the person to be charged with murder charge.
