No, it does 'unlock' it. Via the tip.  The link is unlocked and sent to the user upon a tip.  Now of course the link can be shared everywhere ,but the idea is if you want to support good content then ya...

I hear what you are saying. You can do that. You can do the 'free' option as a link within the reddit post itself that is true  but two immediate benefits of this are 1.) It gets messy when tipping and delivering the goods to people is a real pain. This does it all automatically for the content creator and user.  2.) this can be done anywhere on Reddit.  So if you have good content you can leverage audience reddit has.  But, I get your points.  Like with anything, I suppose the 'tipping' could be an upsell on something that is 'free'.  I mean think of it like if your favorite band has come up with a 45 second unheard/uncut aspect and doesn't want to do a full blown mp3 and they have a reddit channel they could post it up there to receive tips as usual, but in this case they get something back for it because people would be willing to drop .5 cents to hear something nobody has yet.

So once a tip has been done it automatically sends content to their reddit inbox. So the end user will go to their site via a link. 
edit: Just saw your last part of your question explain what you mean does it allow access through google ? You mean can the "link" be found on google ? No, the link is 'locked'.

Tipping someone a few cents in Bitcoin isn't that big of deal to people. The system I have just organizes it a nice , tidy fashion for the content creator and tipper.
