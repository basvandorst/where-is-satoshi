They are trying to solve a real world problem and creating an efficient system for payments? Money will be moved faster around the world instead of waiting days and on top consumers will save money when sending money.  That's a good thing right?

How will this work?  For example -
1. buy 1 bitcoin (current rate $3819.07) and pay exchange fees
2. After few weeks, the price tanks to lets say $3000 and now btc is worth less
3. Visit starbucks to buy coffee with something that lost value??? or people should only buy starbucks when BTC is moooning?  Avoid buying during bear market?
Why not keep $3819.07 in USD and simply use that USD to buy starbucks?  No exchange fees or loosing btc value?  
or is this only for people who bought BTC when it was around $100 or $500?

A lot of people don't like the part where few individuals can tank the market.  Some are questioning the "store of value" part.  Some are questioning if its really decentralized.  Some question the part of limited supply when fork after fork after fork are created.

I think the part about listing it first and putting "Recommended" text below is the issue.

I think ILP is a protocol - [  You can read more here - [
Not sure if Bitcoin can be called a protocol like TCP.

Is it possible for BTC to get replaced?   We see this in tech sector all the time.  
Messenger ---&gt; ICQ --&gt; AIM --&gt; Skype --&gt; Slack
Social ---&gt; Friendster --&gt;  Myspace --&gt; Facebook
What if new tech comes along that offer true real world utility and mass adoption?

why is it a shitcoin?  If it's a shitcoin why is it no 3?  Why are exchanges selling it?  Why do millions keep buying it?

BTC will not go anywhere but the question is will it stay no 1.
