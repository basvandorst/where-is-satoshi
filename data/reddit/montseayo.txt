No reason they can't run a BTC pilot that limits their exposure and allows them to learn the opportunities and challenges. If it's small enough they might not even need to announce it to their shareholders or board. There is no excuse.

This could totally happen; I agree. But if it doesn't, and BTC growth is spurred primarily due to its adoption as a backbone rather than as an end-user tool, that's still a huge win. My bet is that it's closer to an infrastructure improvement than a consumer product, but we'll see. Looks like you and I are both in for the long haul either way, unlike OP!

The concept of ledger is the most useful when discussing bitcoin with lay people (of which I'm definitely one!) The actual, technical definitions of currency, money, means of exchange are all so incredibly loaded and subject to debate that I think the bitcoin community is wasting its time talking about BTC as "currency for the digital age," and all of that stuff. A public ledger of transactions that's not dependent on a single system to verify the truth seems to be the most stable and uncontroversial way to talk about BTC.

One of the reasons this might work is due to the divisibility of BTC. I'm not willing to pay 1 cent for reading an article (the lowest denomination in USD) but I might be willing to pay 0.000001 BTC. (Not sure what Sun-Times' lowest payment is, but they'd be smart to keep it to a fraction of a cent.) Micropayments have been hard to implement in media previously due to the 1-cent minimum.

The news, published by Yahoo Japan, allegedly comes from the exchange’s bankruptcy lawyer who suggests the bitcoins were found on 7th March in a wallet used by Mt. Gox prior to June 2011.
The 200,000 bitcoins would equate to just over 23% of the entirety of the funds presumed lost by the company in the wake of widespread theft that is said to have occurred on the exchanges for a period of several years. Given the date, these funds may be separate from that money, however.

Some possible blockchain apps that could follow Bitcoin are:
* Digital resources: Energy, bandwidth, storage, and computation will be allocated to connected devices and services that need them through efficient bitcoin-based marketplaces. For example: load your smart phone with bitcoin, and it will automatically purchase access to the least expensive WiFi hotspots.
* Immersive virtual worlds: Devices like the Oculus Rift will have bitcoin-based economies, meaning there will be no bright dividing lines between virtual economies and the real world economy.
* Synthetic versions of financial assets: Such products could reduce default risk, increasing transparency, and providing universal access to financial instruments. Example: Smart farms will automatically buy and sell hedging contracts throughout the season using data about soil, weather, yields, and prices.
* Artistic works: Expect pre-funded art projects, tips from patrons, and purchases of art projects in tiny increments when consumed through metered players. Original digital works will be bought and sold by tracking ownership and provenance on the block chain.
* Income-producing assets: The block chain will reduce the friction of share issuance and ownership, allowing us to be stakeholders in entities, large and small, that we care about and contribute to. And the trend toward shared usage of “things” — cars, computers, living space — will accelerate when the objects themselves become self-sustaining economic units.

Messages always work best when you know your audience. Best thing to do is ask your dad what he and his friends find interesting about BTC. If it's how they used to be worthless and now are in the $600+ range, you can focus on how a lot of people treat it like a speculative investment that could conceivably go to $0 or be quite a bit more valuable.

How come these accounts that ask "Is it a good time to buy?" absolutely never respond to the responses? I have literally never seen one of them say "Thanks!" Or even, "Gee, that was a crappy answer." No one knows when it's a good time to buy. That's the point. If everyone knew when it was a good time to buy, the price of BTC would be a fraction of what it is. The risk that you are buying at the wrong time is built in to the price; therefore, you get a higher price than if you knew you would get an annual 1.5% return like Treasuries.

Can't imagine the logical foundations of advocating for additional regulation. Every single use of BTC that the U.S. government might object to is already covered by existing regulation. It's important to use specific language: the choice would seem to be between the current, highly regulated system and a possible future state with even more regulation. No one can reasonably argue that there are "no" regulations on the use of BTC, so the question then becomes "What else could be regulated." From your perspective as trying to set the agenda, it would be helpful if you were to carefully consider how best to frame the debate.

Kathy Chu in Hong Kong
March 5, 2014 1:11 p.m. ET


Mizuho Bank, which handled international wire transfers and other Mt. Gox business at a branch in Tokyo's Shibuya district, had become worried about Mt. Gox as early as mid-2013, following reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had seized money from a Mt. Gox account at a U.S. bank, these people say.


That person also confirmed the authenticity of a recording, circulating widely on the Internet through social media, of a conversation in Japanese between an official from Mizuho Bank and Mt. Gox's head, Mark Karpeles, in late January. The tape indicated that Mizuho was stepping up a push to disassociate itself from Mt. Gox.


On the tape, the Mizuho official can be heard saying, "As we've been saying many times, we want to close your account."
Mr. Karpeles responds: "I discussed with my lawyers and they said we don't need to close it, so we'd like to keep it."


In mid-2013, after the Department of Homeland Security action, Mt. Gox halted dollar withdrawals temporarily. A person close to Mt. Gox said that move came after Mizuho declined to process withdrawals in dollars.


Japanese banks can close accounts only under certain conditions. In the taped conversation, the Mizuho official didn't indicate any specific concern about Mt. Gox's compliance with bank rules. When Mr. Karpeles asked why the bank wanted to close the account, the Mizuho official cited "a collection of various issues."
Possibly exacerbating the issue was that the demands to close the account came as the bank was dealing with a public-relations predicament of its own. Japan's Financial Services Agency was investigating Mizuho for loans that its Orient Corp. consumer-credit affiliate had allegedly made to members of crime groups.
Asked to comment on the audio file, Mr. Karpeles responded in an email, "This recording was not published by us."
A lawyer in charge of Mt. Gox's filing for bankruptcy protection said on Tuesday, "Our priority right now is to fully cooperate with requests from Japanese and other authorities. Therefore we can't make comments to the media at this moment."
He declined to elaborate on which authorities have made requests.
In August 2013, Mt. Gox applied for a license to operate a money-services business in Hong Kong, hoping to move a majority of its banking to the city, the person close to Mt. Gox said. Documents filed with the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department show that Mt. Gox obtained a license in October in Hong Kong to operate such a business. Mt. Gox lists an address in the city belonging to an office-services provider.
Mr. Karpeles already had a business connection to Hong Kong. In 2011, he registered Tibanne Ltd. in the city, listing the company as having HK$10,000 in capital, according to documents filed with the Hong Kong government. It didn't list its intended business activity.
The bank issues facing Mt. Gox took a backseat as technical challenges in its bitcoin exchange operations grew. On Feb. 7, it halted bitcoin withdrawal requests, blaming a bug in the bitcoin software that it said could make fraudulent withdrawals possible.
Even before that, investors were already complaining about long delays in getting money transfers processed.
Several people close to Mt. Gox have said a big pile of withdrawal requests grew further as Japanese banks took a weeklong New Year holiday. Mt. Gox investors in Tokyo started noticing delays in dollar withdrawals in December, while yen-withdrawal delays didn't begin until January.
Tang Shunning, a Mt. Gox investor living in Japan, said his requests to withdraw yen from his Mt. Gox bitcoin account took only two days to complete in December, while in early January, two transactions of about 100,000 yen (around $1,000) each took about a week to clear.
Mr. Tang said he withdrew around ¥6 million in late January, three weeks after he made the request.
According to what he said was a screenshot of his bank transactions, his last withdrawal from Mt. Gox was on Feb. 12, after Mt. Gox had halted bitcoin withdrawals but was still working through its pile of cash-withdrawal requests. Four weeks after he made the withdrawal request, Mr. Tang was able to withdraw ¥8.8 million.
On Feb. 25, a few days before it filed for bankruptcy protection, Mt. Gox halted all transactions.
Separately, Japan's government was preparing to clarify its view on bitcoin, officials said, though they appeared no closer to declaring a specific agency in charge of overseeing the virtual currency.
People familiar with a draft being prepared for a cabinet meeting scheduled for Friday say the government will reaffirm that Japan doesn't consider bitcoin a currency, which has been the basis for the argument by the Financial Services Agency, Japan's banking watchdog, that bitcoin shouldn't be subject to its oversight.

This. I'm reading all of the doom and gloom posts about how this is the end of bitcoin. Yes, it sounds like a huge pain in the ass, but you have to think sharp start-ups will start working on this problem and provide this as a service for bitcoiners who want to comply. 
Or, you can just ignore the whole damn thing, roll the dice and figure the IRS doesn't have the time, resources or willpower to come after every single one of us who buys a soda with BTC.

Simply believing BTC has the potential to transform everyday consumer experiences isn't going to make it happen. This assessment by Citi clearly lays out the challenges ahead. The arms race to build the fastest mining rigs and the business realities faced by large merchants that accept BTC are severely holding back BTC price to an extent that's hard to ignore. We need a real BTC "killer app" that quickly generates consumer adoption to counteract this downward pressure.

The bitcoin community made a mistake for pushing it as something to buy groceries and coffee. It's not a consumer-level product, it's something that can power the financial services industry. Remittances, contracts, who knows what else can be transformed with BTC. 
I'm just the "average Joe/Jane" who just happened to learn about this product, bought some hoping for the day it might be worth a lot more, but not because other "average Joes/Janes" use it to buy a latte. If the price ever goes "to the moon," it'll be because it helps facilitate some incredibly slow, ineffective financial processes and it gets adopted by major financial players. It makes no difference to me if I never use BTC to buy lunch.

I have been quite intimidated to talk to random people about BTC because I didn't feel I could answer questions about "replacing the dollar," or "how is this better than my credit card." I think we in the bitcoin community get in trouble when we try to advocate for BTC as a replacement for something so fundamental to people's lives as money and credit. But the concept of how to verify truth independent of a central organization making the calls (like the Federal Reserve, or Chase Bank) is something that I feel more comfortable talking about.

Money might actually ruin bitcoin in the long run. Hadn't thought of it that way, but it's an extremely relevant point. The frenzy has put bitcoin in the same league as the stock of publicly traded companies, which must show quarterly profit no matter what or they take a beating in the markets.

Weird Karmic shit: Sean's Outpost is named after Sean Dugas, a journalist in Pensacola who was murdered over his $100,000 collection of cards for the game Magic the Gathering.

You bring up good points about the terrible individual consumer experience. Perhaps bitcoin truly isn't a consumer product. The blockchain could eventually disrupt commerce, contracts, a variety of other financial transactions without ever getting to the individual level.

There is a school of thought that transaction volume can be used a rough proxy for Bitcoin adoption. See [here]( Despite the nuances and the difficulty in weeding out the "real" transactions versus "noise," transaction volume is probably one of the best metrics of adoption. And that's the real metric. Usage. Adoption, not the daily or hourly spot price in various exchanges, one of which is probably about to collapse. That's Eric's point. Of course other metrics exist, such as the number of outlets that accept BTC, network hash rate overall, etc. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:31:28
I've thought about that quite a bit. My rational side tells me that you are right; utility and price are not necessarily correlated. BTC could be $1 USD and still have transactional utility. However, I am emotionally vested (unfortunately!) in a scenario where the price increases significantly as the BTC protocol is put to greater and greater use to transfer value, record contracts, and all of the other uses that are just now being imagined.

Here is the interesting part: 
&lt;I think of Bitcoin as a new set of payment rails. The math-based algorithms that cure the double-spend challenge also flatten the card industry's four-party model – with its chain of providers, authorization messages and settlement steps – into a simpler cash-like, push-based, peer-to-peer transaction process.
 
Consumers and business users alike, accustomed to "zero liability" and the ability to charge back transactions, will struggle with the learning curve needed to safely conduct such push transactions. Experience with this approach will be needed, as will more user-friendly and secure software and hardware wallets for storing these valuable strings of bits. These approaches are, as even the regulators acknowledge, experimental.

@_date: 2014-10-06 22:08:57
Here is the story:


Late afternoon in New York Monday, bitcoin was trading up 3.69% on the day at $331.45, according to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. In the early hours of Asian trading it had dropped to $301.29, in a brief revival of some of the furious selling seen on online markets Sunday, when the price fell as low as $286.56. That low point represents a 75% decline from the peak Of $1,165.89 that bitcoin hit on Nov. 30 last year but is still almost three times the $99 price at which it traded this time last year.
The catalyst for the latest bout of selling appears to have been a 30,000-bitcoin sell order priced at $300, which surfaced Sunday morning on Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp. That one order represented twice the normal volume on BitStamp, one of the more liquid of various online exchanges for the virtual currency. The order was later withdrawn but reappeared temporarily at different levels.
The supposed attempt to sell $9 million worth of the digital currency spooked investors into a flight from bitcoin. According Bitcoinwisdom.com, total volume on the 12 exchanges it tracks ran to around 640,000 bitcoins over the 24 hours to 1 p.m. EDT Monday, more than 3½ times the daily average of the past 30 days.
Matt Odell, co-founder and executive editor of market analytics firm Coinprices.com, said the seller’s placement on an open exchange suggested a large player was attempting to manipulate the price. A smart investor who wanted to legitimately unload holdings would have done so in an over-the-counter market where their actions are not displayed to the broader marketplace to avoid making the price move against them, he said.
“Just selling half of that order would have totally crashed the price of bitcoin,” Mr. Odell said, adding that he suspected the quickly withdrawn offer was placed by a large player such as an exchange, which may have needed to meet a large order from a customer. By temporarily driving down the price, this large player would be able to buy bitcoins at the lower level and so fill the order cheaply.
There were other sources of ongoing selling pressure. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket Inc. and a prominent bitcoin advocate, said some U.S. investors are selling bitcoin to finance tax bills due Oct. 15—the expiration date for the six-month extensions filed after the Internal Revenue Service announced in the spring that bitcoin sales would be subject to capital gains tax. “There are people with sizable tax bills,” Mr. Silbert said, the profit accumulation “goes all the way back to 2009.”
Bitcoin investors are also generally concerned that regulators are taking a tougher stance globally. Russia’s government announced a bill over the weekend that, if passed, would declare any “money substitutes” illegal.
But if these factors invite sellers into bitcoin and keep buyers at bay, it is the lack of volume that exacerbates the market reaction. The combined average daily turnover on the biggest bitcoin exchanges runs to $60 million at current prices. By comparison, more than $5 trillion changes hands daily in the world’s traditional currency markets. The thin bitcoin volume fosters volatility, which in turn decreases the digital currency’s appeal as a payments vehicle, even though merchants are increasingly making it available as an option for shoppers.
One way to resolve that would be to draw bigger investors into the market. And by many accounts, there continues to be interest from institutional and wealthy investors who have been otherwise locked out of the market because the infrastructure isn’t developed enough.
New York-based bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX Partners Inc. is among various startups seeking to address that. The firm says that in response to demand from its hedge fund clients it is developing dollar-denominated total return swaps based off bitcoin’s price. By giving these investors a familiar instrument to trade without having to own bitcoin outright, SolidX will bring in “a whole other pool of capital that can, depending on what’s going on, provide support or provide price pressure,” said Chief Executive Daniel H. Gallancy.

Huge difference between "new" regulation and explaining how current regulation governs bitcoin. I refuse to believe we need anything new, see Charlie Shrem, Ross Ulbricht, etc. If the feds want to nail you, damn it, they are going to nail you. Aside from the illegal activity, there's no telling how many BTC folks are going to run afoul of the IRS once that guidance is solidified. I'm not sure what "new" regs could possibly trump the vast enforcement system that's already in place.

2014 will be a key year for bitcoin, and for the reasons the author states: regulation, adoption and volatility. I'm actually not worried about volatility. I can see a future where regulation is nailed down (neither good nor bad, just settled) and adoption continues to grow, even if volatility continues. I'm not a commerce expert, but I believe businesses that accept BTC can shield themselves somewhat from the volatility. In terms of volatility for speculators, well, that's why they are called speculators!

Before Coinbase, they were the easiest way for US based folks to buy bitcoin, especially when they had the relationship with Dwolla.

Bitcoin isn't currency anyway. Currency is simple. Bitcoin is a protocol, a foundation, on which talented innovators will create new financial instruments, or radically improve current models of commerce in ways we can't even imagine. Currency is what you use to buy candy at the store; a protocol can revolutionize entire industries.

Well, I'm not sure how you'd ID the pool of celebrities, but you could give odds on a list of celebrities that are most likely to be arrested in 14 days. So you'd list Justin Bieber, Young Jeezy, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown, etc., and see who gets busted. Of course, if there are no arrests in 14 days, I'm assuming you'd roll it over. Anyway, just having fun.

The only thing that is truly, truly difficult about BTC is absolutely safe storage. Buying, selling BTC itself, and even buying things with it, is not that difficult, and there's much developing and innovating happening now to ensure it's even easier. However, to keep it safe? That's not something most lay people have figured out how to do. I think what BTC needs to be more user friendly is affordable (not costing 1  BTC, or $660, for god's sake!) indestructible hardware wallets.

Ok, really dumb question here. If third-party whatevers are not allowed to do business with exchanges, what are the ways China residents can legally buy bitcoin? Does this limit it to person-to-person buys as with localbitcoins.com? Can China residents link their bank accounts with exchanges directly and buy as with Coinbase? I guess if we could understand whether people in China can still buy bitcoin, we'd know how bad this guidance from the PBOC is.

I'd hate for BTC to end up being the ["Friendster"]( of cryptocurrency that will eventually be replaced by an analogous "MySpace" that in turn will be replaced by the "Facebook." Will BTC owners have the will and skill to transfer their value from one platform to another and avoid losses if this happens? Is there something about BTC that will endure? I'm not a technical expert so I can't delve into the guts of the protocol, but I've heard this analogy before and it's something I think about.

Any concerns this dynamic can be twisted into extorting concessions from upstanding businesses when in fact there has been no wrongdoing? 
Could a scammer take a fabricated case to the community and force a business to comply even though they've done nothing wrong? 
Of course, the business that's being attacked could mount a defense and demonstrate the attack is false, but will it be less expensive and time-consuming just to give the extortionist what they want?

When it crashes, you just hope you've got cash in an exchange and are lucky enough to catch the 10-minute window that the price is really low. If you miss that window, the price goes back up pretty quick, if not exactly to where it was then high enough to leave you bummed you didn't catch the bottom.

If you had $10 million to put into BTC right now (yes, there are people who can do this), how would you do it? You would need strong assurance of security, liquidity and availability. Can any exchange or entity provide all of those today? This is why the Second Market trust is a big deal. Until real "whales" can put their money into BTC, adoption will suffer.

What is a bitcoin worth?
For the growing band of people who follow the virtual currency, the answer is self-evident: The price of a bitcoin this week surpassed $780, a record.
On Jan. 1, you could have bought a bitcoin for merely $13.50. At Friday afternoon's price of about $730, that bet would have grown about 54-fold.
The bitcoin phenomenon, and the technological innovation that made it possible, is interesting—but for investors large and small, the more pertinent question is whether they should buy the virtual currency or avoid it.
Unlike traditional money, bitcoin exists only online. To create, or "mine," the currency, computers guess solutions to complex math problems and send them to other computers on the bitcoin network. (More on that below.)
As time goes on and more coins are mined, it becomes more difficult to create bitcoins. Right now, about 12 million bitcoins have been found, with about 9 million yet to be discovered.
Once created, bitcoins can be traded on currency exchanges or used as money to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept it.
Its limited supply has made bitcoin attractive to people worried about inflation, while its anonymous nature makes it a favorite among those making illegal transactions.
On Monday and Tuesday, bitcoin's strengths and weaknesses were discussed in Congress, with U.S. Senate committees hearing testimony from federal officials who attempted to explain how bitcoin worked, what its legitimate uses are and why it has been attractive to criminals.
Even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke weighed in, writing in a letter to a Senate committee that bitcoin and other virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system."
Yet some economic historians are already comparing bitcoin fever to legendary manias of the past.
Larry Neal, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Illinois, is in the midst of writing a textbook on the history of international finance. He says he's thinking of including a passage on bitcoin and how it embodies investors' struggle for returns.
"Where's the backing that would persuade random strangers to accept this?" says Mr. Neal, who in his book "I Am Not Master of Events" wrote about a currency bubble in 18th-century France that ended with investors losing most of their money.
But on the flip side of the coin are investors such as Raoul Pal, a former hedge-fund manager and founder of the Global Macro Investor, a macroeconomic research service. This month, Mr. Pal issued a research report to his subscribers that concluded with the words: "Trade Recommendation: Buy Bitcoin."

You nailed it. Free world adoption based on innovation will drive BTC. Without it, it'll just be a story we tell our kids about Magic Internet Money.

I've been learning about BTC since mid-April and the consensus at this point is the best way to see some appreciation if you want to invest USD is to buy BTC and hold it. Mining has progressed to the point that the average person  (i.e., you haven't been mining all along) won't be able to get into the game at this point. Just a thought from a regular person who has gotten involved in BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:26:25

All snark aside, I would love for someone to answer your question. The problem is that it's impossible to answer. Anyone who has the answer probably wouldn't be sharing it freely, and anyone who shares their opinion freely probably doesn't have the answer (i.e., where is BTC price going.) Only advice that I've seen of any value is to expect to lose everything you put into BTC, and if that doesn't happen, be thankful. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:58:26
Far, far from an expert, but I assumed BTC would drop a bit if USD and gold went up. It's too early to know what role a mature BTC market eventually will play in the wider trading world, but what I know of BTC leads me to believe it's a possible hedge against the dollar and gold.

All I'm bummed about is my funds transfer to Dwolla won't clear until tomorrow! If I'd done it a day earlier, I could be catching some of this. I better just keep some cash in there when buying opportunities like this pop up! (I'm doing Dwolla USD transfers to CampBx to buy bitcoin.)

Hi, Trevor: would love to answer here if that's ok. I own between 0 and 5 BTC. I'm in the U.S. Bought my 1st BTC on April 22, 2013. After much research I decided to link a bank checking acct to Dwolla. I transferred the funds there, then moved the USD into the CampBx exchange for purchase. There is a 25 cent fee to transfer USD from Dwolla to CampBx charges .55 percent per transaction. The biggest difficulty for a new user is sorting out all of the possibilities and deciding which one meets the most requirements. Essentially, I wanted to transact everything without having to leave my home or meet a stranger in person. I have been satisfied so far, but this is not a quick merhod at all! takes at least 4 days from bank transfer to Dwolla to buying BTC. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:26:43
I'd love to see these spread. But for everything I've read you have to work through the legal requirements of every locality in which you want to place them. And rules are so different. I think each state in the U.S. has different guidelines, let alone foreign locations.

Definitely agree the bitcoin community will just continue shopping around until it finds a group of banks willing to work with bitcoin. Just seems like there's not enough money in it for banks, so why would they play? Their history is to gouge clients on fees at any opportunity, and I hope this is not the case with bitcoin funds. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:53:24
I've used CampBX (via Dwolla-no longer possible, and USPS money order), BitInstant (probably defunct) and Coinbase (via linked bank account). Can't wait for Nov. 20 when CampBX says it will allow ACH funds transfer in to purchase. Never had any problems with any site, any funding method. I believe I'm one of the very few on here who've never had a delay or cancelled order, so I must be living a charmed life!

If it crashes, the only ones who'll be able to buy are the pros who can literally watch this (directly or using bots) 24/7 and have big money positions sitting in exchanges (several) for just such a crash. The chances of a regular person buying at the true bottom of a drop like that are pretty low. With all of the money sitting in the sidelines, a drop like that won't last very long and before you know it, it'll be back to near record levels. You might save some money, but another thing to consider is that if BTC ever gets to 1 for $10,000, the difference between $600 and $800 won't seem like much. I recommend buying for the long-term, ignoring the daily wild price swings and only investing what you can literally afford to lose completely if it all goes terribly wrong.

Hello, General Dynamics: I'm sure you are aware but a huge barrier of entry for bitcoin is the issue of storage and security. There are numerous horror stories of people losing significant investments due to user error, hardware malfunctions and outright theft.

It's a communication/education approach, not a technical solution. If members of the bitcoin community talked in terms such as "Did you know you can have some bitcoin for as little as 6 cents," and encourage friends and family to try it for fun with very little risk, we could have an impact. I agree that people assume you have to buy an "entire" bitcoin to participate and it's keeping people out. It's our opportunity to help folks better understand.

One suggestion, based only on what worked for me. The flow is bank &gt;&gt; Dwolla &gt;&gt; CampBx &gt;&gt; Bitcoin. You create an account with Dwolla and link a bank account to it. That process will take 2 or so days and involves Dwolla sending two tiny deposits to your bank that you will need to verify. Once that's set, you can transfer USD to Dwolla. That took  4 business days to go through. Then, create a CampBx account. When your funds clear in Dwolla, you can send them to CampBx and buy bitcoin. I'm sure I've left some minor details of the purchase process out, but this is a high-level overview. Once you've secured your Bitcoin, you will need to conduct research on a secure wallet method. Good luck!

You need to decide how much info about yourself you want to share. If you don't want to disclose any info, your best bet is to buy bitcoin from someone in your area directly with cash. If you don't mind disclosing your bank info, email address, you can buy them completely online. You will need to create an account with an exchange such as Mt Gox or CampBx. At this point, you essentially will be letting them know who you are. Then you will need a way to get funds into the account. You can send them a money order, or do a wire transfer. You can also link a bank account to an online service called Dwolla and then use it to send money to an exchange. Once you have money in an exchange, you can buy bitcoin. This is extremely high level, so you'll need to do a lot more research. Also, there is a ton of research you'll need to do about where to put your coins once you own them. That's what is called a wallet and there is a lot of info on setting one up available on this subreddit. Good luck!

Consider creating an account in an exchange such as Bitstamp, CampBX, MtGox and others. (Coinbase is not an exchange; you can search this sub for an explanation why.) Send 1 BTC to your new account exchange. When the price of BTC goes as high as you think it'll go in the short-term, sell it. Wait for the inevitable price drop (could be a few months.) Buy as much BTC as you can afford at the low point. Depending on the spread between your sale price at the high and your buy price at the low, you will end up with 1 BTC + 
Good luck!

BTC is an all-or-nothing game. There are tons of arguments on either side. If you believe it's "all," then the China crackdown is only a temporary setback. That's not as crazy as it sounds. If you believe BTC has potential to disrupt the world economy, one totalitarian country cracking down makes no difference. If you are convinced BTC is no more valuable than tulips, then you are welcome to laugh all you want and to believe this China situation is a death knell. Only one of those views are correct.

You are correct. It takes 3-4 business days to get money from your bank account to Dwolla, then you have to move it from Dwolla to CampBX in a separate transaction, which usually takes 30 minutes or less. I like CampBX but there is no "instant" way to fund it that I know of.

This is probably exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind when (he/she/they) created bitcoin.

You need to decide how to deal with Terms of Use for various bitcoin-related entities that require you to be 18 years of age. Would hate for you to get into it with an exchange, etc., if you misrepresent your age. For example, here is what the Mt. Gox ToS states:

they are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms and enter into a transaction resulting on the Platform

Aside from how, just wanted to point out that there is no need to actually buy 1 BTC, regardless of what 1 BTC costs in USD. You can decide you want to spend $10, $100, $1,000 or whatever and spend just that amount. You can buy 0.01 BTC if you want. That's one of the powerful things about BTC.

This part really pisses me off: "Crowdfunding must be done through a registered broker-dealer or registered “funding portal." 
What's the point of raising money directly from individual investors if they are forced to work with a middle man and pay middle-man fees? 
Not sure BTC would help, since the regs would probably require the firm seeking funds to certify that all the capital was raised via brokers. I imagine you could get around it, but there would be trouble if the SEC decided to audit.

I get what you're saying. We currently think of our household net worth in USD, for example, and we don't have to compare it to anything else. "Not including my house, my net worth is $XX,XXX..."
We don't say "My net worth is $XX,XXX, which is equivalent to XXX,XXX yen or something."
So yeah, one day folks will just say to themselves "I've got 55 bitcoins in my wallet" and that's all they'll need to know about their assets. 
And when the day comes that you can buy a house in San Francisco for 5 BTC, we won't even remember that BTC was first pegged to USD to figure out its "value."
As far as when this will happen? 20 years or so, maybe?

Right. Took my funds four hours from Dwolla to Campbx. Campbx updates every six hours, so it could take as long as that, depending on when you hit their cycle. So four business days to get from bank to Dwolla, then four hours from Dwolla to CampBx. After that, the bitcoin purchase was instantaneous since I had a fixed dollar amount that I was going to spend regardless of the prevailing price.

I don't think it's people who learned of BTC after the April 2013 crash. I think it's more likely tech savvy people who had the wherewithal and opportunity to mine hundreds of coins when 1 BTC was .0001 USD or some crazy thing, and due to laziness or lack of foresight decided not to. Those are the folks who are (rightfully) full of regret. I know I would be. As for me, I was never in this position, only hearing of BTC "After the crash," and I've tried to buy as much BTC as I could without missing a rent payment since then.

All exchanges such as Mt. Gox charge trading fees to buy bitcoin, some more than others. In terms of average users, you should investigate the potential benefits to the millions (billions?) of people who regularly must transfer currency internationally. Not in my daily experience but I understand current systems are much more costly than bitcoin transactions. People sending money back to family in another country would seem a massive potential user base for bitcoin.

I'm never selling any BTC. I got in 2 weeks after the April 2013 bubble crash, only because it took me that long to research how to buy BTC and then set up all of the transactions to get money into an exchange. I was bummed because the price was $132/BTC when I bought, after having crashed to something like $60. I'm not so bummed about $132 now! Anyway, any spare cash I can get goes to BTC, regardless the exchange rate. If things go as we all hope, I'll never need to convert it to fiat. My dream is that BTC will take its place among global currency and I'll use my coins to buy my home and fund my retirement. To the moon!

Maybe BTC is the new mutual fund, but not savings. At least in the U.S., savings are federally protected up to $250,000, so savers have that big psychological support that their principal is safe. With BTC, you literally could lose everything. I get the loss of purchasing power, but most people only think of the bottom line, which is I put $1,000 in and I better get $1,000 out, plus whatever piddly interest gets thrown in there.

I'm assuming you will be giving them paper wallets. Maybe you can make it a game where you tell them, Look, I'm giving you $50 (or whatever) but in order to get it, you have to complete some "challenges," such as creating your own wallet, figuring out how to send the "money" from the paper wallet to their own wallet, and then how to convert it to fiat (if they want.) I bet you would like them to hold the BTC, but I think some of your peeps will be bummed if they are not able to turn it into something they are more familiar with (cash.) Just some thoughts!

They picked a real shitty weekend to take their cash option down. BTC is below $100 and unless you have USD already sitting in an exchange ready to buy (I, of course, don't), you're stuck watching people snatch up coin at a discount. By the time I send USD from my bank to Dwolla and into an exchange, it'll be back up to $120/BTC and who the fuck wants to pay that much. Thanks, Bitinstant. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:06:34
I, for one, believe the dude. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:25:03
Ok, here are some extremely general observations. If you want hardcore technical analysis from traders, you can check r/bitcoinmarkets. Yes, it's probably going to go down somewhat between now and Thanksgiving, and probably into the weekend. There's no reason to think there will be a crash, which is a massive loss. However, price tends to (generally) go down on holidays and weekends. Also, it just reached an all time high today, so there definitely will be people who want to cash out and take their profits. I highly encourage you to hold through the weekend if prices go down. No reason to sell at a loss, no matter how scared you get. Keep your coin until the price goes back up to more than you paid for, and also account for whatever fees you paid to buy. If you can't stand the volatility and decide you want to sell at a small profit, that's fine. But selling at a loss due to panic is a big mistake.

I couldn't believe how quickly the unconfirmed transaction showed up on blockchain.info after using the Zipmark iOS app to "pay the bill" (in other words, send the money to Bitinstant.) I'm not sure what the 2-day delay was all about, because I created new Bitinstant and Zipmark accounts in the last hour just to try this and everything went through instantly. Is this the cheapest way to buy Bitcoin? No, but sending USD from my bank to Dwolla, then transferring to CampBx took 4-5 days, and this took literally 30 minutes, including the time to create two new accounts. I've heard a lot of knocks against Bitinstant, but this is a significant step toward reducing the barrier to entry.

It does take a lot of will not to bail when the price is falling. I've been buying BTC for 9 months and there's been huge drops in that time. I see where people panic sell all the time, then regret it later. Long term, buy and hold is the surest way to succeed. Good luck!

I'm afraid there is very little incentive to spend BTC right now. 0.1 BTC is about $72 as of this time, so let's say a decent dinner for two (on my budget, not you BTC millionaires.) Why on earth would I spend that if it could (even a very small probability) be worth 100 times that in the next 10 years? Of course the price run-up that I'm dreaming about depends on adoption, which depends people using BTC, but too many of us aren't going to be the ones spending. Just putting out there what many are thinking.

It's not a quick process, but I've had good experiences with transferring USD from Dwolla to CampBx and buying bitcoin that way. Longest wait us getting USD from bank to Dwolla (4 biz days) but it then takes 4-6 hrs to get funds from Dwolla to CampBx. Convoluted but it works unless you need instant transactions. Cost 25 cents to send cash from Dwolla to CampBx and CampBx charges .55 percent commission on trades. Good luck!

Two possible options are Jeff Bezos, who personally bought the Washington ~~Times~~ Post like you and I by groceries, and Pierre Omidyar, who is spending $250 million to back a new journalism venture with Greg Greenwald. 
They might be more open to new tech than old-school bricks and mortar publishers, who make used car salesmen seem ethical. I realize the Bezos-Amazon dynamic might complicate his PR if he decides to accept BTC for Post content, but perhaps he is keeping these ventures separate.

Honestly I'm not sure the best and most natural use of BTC is to replace fiat. Thousands of years of human commerce will not evaporate on our lifetimes.

April 2013, about 2 weeks after the crash from $266. I created a Dwolla account, funded $100, then moved it to CampBX. I bought in at $122/BTC  since I moved too late to catch the bottom. Since then I've bought with Bitinstant via Moneygram and Coinbase with a linked bank account as well. Only mode I haven't used is localbitcoin.

Had my monthly USD allotment ready to go, waiting for the "big drop" that lots of people expected to get a fraction BTC. Saw it go below $1,000, below $950, then I lost my nerve and pulled the trigger at $932 on Coinbase. Felt great compared to $1,160 or so until it kept falling, all the way down to $795. You can't catch a falling knife...Anyway, I'm strictly buy and hold, but even then you can screw yourself.

Fair enough. I agree. It's rude and immature to insult folks who are skeptical about BTC in general and it's prospects for value growth. Just because I am hopeful doesn't mean I have the right to lash out at someone who rightly points out the chances are close to zero. The lottery analogy is quite apt. You can't win unless you buy a ticket, and there's always that thrill right before they call someone else's lotto number. I enjoy that thrill; but at the same time, I don't get upset when others point out "You know, there's no chance you are going to win the lottery!"

Excellent research, and I agree with your conclusions. In case the brother -and-sister team who are CampBX are reading this, I would ask them to please consider hiring at least one highly-skilled temp (you can get them if you are willing to pay a high enough hourly wage) who you can train to handle your customer support. You will lose real $$$ if users are continually frustrated by lack of access. Temps aren't "out of the box" but they can be trained to handle your business. Who knows, if they work out they can be Employee No. 3!

BTC will either have a significant price run-up in the 3-5 year horizon, or it'll be worth zero. If you are worried about the zero option, you might as well sell now and take your losses. I'm not worried about my BTC being worth zero. I didn't cash out my 401(k) or life insurance to buy BTC. I didn't borrow from the mob to buy BTC. I didn't empty my life savings to buy BTC. I am not so deluded that I'm convinced my belief absent everything else that has to happen will by itself prop up the price. But I'm not worried because it can truly go to zero and I won't "lose" anything that I care about. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:05:49
Other than "we're dicks," there is no logical reason for Wires to "disappear" the BTC. Agree that the effect on the ecosystem is essentially zero, so this is just a moral argument, not financial or technical. You tell a food kitchen struggling to fill their pantry and feed hungry children that it's ok to waste the equivalent of $234 (about what 2 BTC is worth right now.)

I totally appreciate the point of the OP. Unless you've done this before, and have done it a lot, you are going to lose your ass at first. Period. Now, some of you might be OK with that. "Right, I know I'll lose my ass, but I'm willing to take the hit because I'm going to learn and eventually, I'll make money." That's great; more power to you. However, I couldn't take losing due to my own actions. Sure, if BTC goes to $0 because of some catastrophe, Oh Well. But if I go bust because I fat-fingered the keyboard, or fell asleep, or was drunk, No way I'm gonna accept that. Which means, I'm the perfect profile to buy and hold, whether it goes bust or To The Moon.

I've read dozens of comments about Coinbase and no one has had any problems with security of their info.

You can fund [CampBX]( exchange by mailing them a US Postal Service money order, so you don't need to link a bank or credit card account as long as you are only trading less than $1,000 a day. If I remember correctly, you do need to provide an email account, but you can create a throwaway just for that purpose. It took 2 weeks for my funds to show up in my CampBX account after I put the money order in the mail, so this isn't quick. CampBX is U.S.-based, although if you search this sub you will see that apparently it is literally a guy and his sister.

I wonder if all of these repetitive posts asking whether it's the right time to get in aren't really some massive experiment to gather data about the irrationality of markets or market psychology. We see about a half dozen or so a day, and it's always from someone who's allegedly watched BTC prices for more than a year, when BTC prices were laughably low. Then there is the same basic organization, have been researching, always too worried to get in, but now's the time, and finally, where do we see the price going. Is it possible these are all unique questions from people in the same exact situation? Possibly. One thing that makes me skeptical is that people who've been researching BTC for any amount of time usually are keenly aware that no one knows where the "f" the price is going. So asking the question seems a bit artificial, if not outright deceptive. I'm leaning toward some sort of orchestrated effort to collect data; no way these are genuine.

Bitinstant is quick (thus, "instant") but you pay a huge premium for that. If you are not in a rush, what I've done for 3 successful transactions takes 3-4 days, but you never have to leave your home. First, link a checking account to Dwolla (yes, they will know the name of the account holder, although if you are an LLC that's less of an issue.) Transfer USD from your checking account to Dwolla. Then open a CampBx account. Once your USD is in Dwolla, transfer it to CampBx and buy your BTC. Finally, sign up for a wallet at blockchain.info and transfer your BTC from CampBx. Both CampBx and blockchain.info offer 2-factor auth and I highly recommend you activate this. My method is cheap (CampBx charges .55 percent transaction fees), and painless (no need to withdraw cash and deposit in person at a MoneyGram location like Bitinstant.) Also, this presumes you are in the US and that you are not ready to buy BTC directly from a local seller in person. Good luck!

You never stated where the $100K comes from. I don't have $100K now, and I didn't back in August 2012. I'm assuming there's a bank account that I can access when I travel to August 2012? 'Cause we all know from Terminator movies that anything non-organic won't go through the time warp. We'll all show up naked, in the middle of some street.
So that should be another condition: -You are willing to appear naked in the middle of some random street, where you will likely be arrested and charged with public indecency.
Then, when you tell the desk sergeant that "No, I'm really a time traveler who is chasing some free bitcoin," you will be involuntarily committed to a 72-hour psych hold at the nearest mental health facility.
Another bullet item: - You are willing to spend 72 hours in the psych ward.
At the end of the 72 hours, you'll be thrown out on the streets with jail-issued orange attire, I'd bet. 
Ok, so then you walk to the aforementioned bank to access your account with your orange jail-issued attire. You last about 30 seconds before the security officer has his 9mm Glock pointed at your skull and invites you to get down on the ground and wait for the FBI to arrive with your new ride to federal detention.

Are you trying to profit from minute-to-minute swings in price (day trading?) or do you just want to buy BTC and keep them in hopes the price will continue trending up in the long term? If you really think you want to day trade, Coinbase is not for you. If you're just a regular person who wants a relatively easy way to buy BTC, you can definitely give Coinbase a try. A lot of the complaints are from people who must have BTC immediately, which Coinbase is not good at. Also, it doesn't allow the quick trades that day traders require. The complaints I've heard are that a) Coinbase couldn't verify my identity and b) they took too long to get me my BTC. I've never heard that they flat out stole your money, like Inputs.io or some dodgy Chinese exchange. Best thing is to decide what you want out of BTC and go from there. I personally am not a day trader and don't care if I get my BTC instantly or in 7 days, as long as the price I pay is what I expected. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:36:46
I don't care about the USD-BTC ratio. I know how much I can spend at any given time ($50,$100,$0) and buy that amount. It all appreciates. This fixation with the USD cost of 1 BTC is really rather pointless, don't you think?

Mr. Pal admits there's a likelihood that bitcoin ends up being worthless. But there's also a chance, he says, that it ends up taking over at least part of gold's traditional role as a store of value.
Other bitcoin proponents believe it could become an integral part of the remittance market, since bitcoins can be sent to relatives abroad with lower fees and less hassle than traditional money-transfer services.
If it replaces some or all of gold's role, given the limited supply of bitcoins relative to that of gold, the potential upside for bitcoin is huge, possibly hundreds of times the current price, Mr. Pal says.
In other words, a small amount of bitcoin is a kind of lottery ticket. It will probably be worth nothing, but if it's worth something, it could be worth a lot.
That gives individual investors two legitimate choices. The safest, and least expensive, route: "Just ignore the whole thing," says Mr. Neal.
But for the more daring: Buy one or a fraction of one, or a handful of bitcoins, with money that's set aside for speculation and can be lost, says Mr. Pal.
Here's a guide to how bitcoin works, how it's performed as a speculation so far and why it might not be a terrible idea to buy a tiny stake.
The Bitcoin Network
An anonymous cryptography expert or group going by the name " Satoshi Nakamoto " released bitcoin on the Internet in 2009.
Unlike traditional currency, which is issued in digital and physical form by governments, bitcoin exists only online and is maintained by a decentralized network of computers, called "miners," which create new bitcoins and verify transactions. Anyone can become a miner using his home computer, though now miners tend to use specialized computing systems that can cost thousands of dollars.
The miners attempt to guess solutions to increasingly difficult math problems, while recording bitcoin transfers in the process, for which they're awarded bitcoins. As more miners enter the network, competition to find solutions also increases, and as more bitcoins are created, the potential payoff falls. The system is designed so that the total number of bitcoins won't exceed 21 million.
Once a bitcoin is created, it can be sent between users using digital addresses and stored in virtual "wallets," which have passwords that guard access to the bitcoins. If the passwords are lost or stolen, the bitcoins are lost forever.
Investors can also purchase bitcoins online through websites such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp.net, San Francisco-based Coinbase.com and Tokyo-based Mt. Gox. In addition, a number of alternative digital currencies have sprung up, with names such as litecoin and peercoin, though none is remotely as popular as bitcoin.
For now, relatively few mainstream merchants—including dating site OkCupid and blogging platform WordPress.com—take bitcoins for goods or services, though the number is growing. Many merchants use services that, for a fee, immediately convert bitcoins into dollars.
Some merchants say they like bitcoin because they don't have to pay hefty credit-card transaction fees. Investors worried about inflation like the fact that the supply of bitcoins can't be manipulated by a central authority. Criminals like that transactions happen anonymously.
Lately, speculators have liked it because, well, bitcoin's price in U.S. dollars has grown exponentially in less than a year.
The whole thing reminds some observers of the tulip-bulb mania that struck the Netherlands in the 1600s.
Reliable data for tulip prices is scarce, but in 1637, a speculator bought a "Semper Augustus" variety of tulip bulb for 5,500 guilders, according to data provided by Peter Garber, a strategist at Deutsche Bank who has studied the period.
At the time, the same amount of money could have bought about 45 oxen, according to Mr. Garber.
In the same way, bitcoins are only worth something as long as other investors or merchants say they are. That's led some to compare bitcoins to gold as a "store of value."
"It's as if there was an effort to create gold that wasn't gold," says Peter Rodriguez, an economist at the University of Virginia. "The longer they persist, the more that people will have faith in them as a legitimate store of value."
Others are less optimistic.
With gold, there are also uses in jewelry and industry, says Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University who has researched gold's role in a portfolio.
"Gold's value can be overstated at times, but it has a use," he says. "Bitcoin is nothing like that."
Bitcoin as an Investment
So what does bitcoin look like as an asset class right now, and how should investors treat it?
If it's an asset class, it's an incredibly volatile one.
According to an analysis of bitcoin prices performed for The Wall Street Journal by Mr. Harvey, between late 2010 and Wednesday, bitcoin's return in U.S. dollars had an annualized "standard deviation" of about 139%. That means it was roughly 7½ times as volatile as gold and more than eight times as volatile as the S&amp;P 500.
Since last Friday, when bitcoin cost $411, the price of a bitcoin has fallen as low as $387 and risen as high as $782, according to CoinDesk.com, which averages bitcoin prices across multiple exchanges.
Marie Brière, an associate professor at Université Paris Dauphine in France, calculated that between July 2010 and July 2013, bitcoin had an annualized return of more than 370% with 175% volatility. She found that its returns had a weak but significant correlation with gold and inflation-linked bonds, supporting the notion that some investors see bitcoin as an inflation fighter.
Her paper, which was co-authored by Kim Oosterlinck and Ariane Szafarz of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, concluded that a small allocation to bitcoin—perhaps 3% of a well-diversified portfolio—could improve one's risk-return trade-off.
But that study was conducted when bitcoin was merely four years old, and even Ms. Brière says investors will have to wait and see which, if any, of bitcoin's characteristics persist.
"I'd be very cautious. Is this a bubble or not? That's very hard to determine at this point," she says.
And yet some firms are already trying to make it easier for investors to get involved.
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, of Facebook fame, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an exchange-traded fund, called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, that holds bitcoins. In an email from their lawyer, the Winklevosses said they are working with the SEC to finalize the proposal and hope to launch next year.
SecondMarket, a platform for investing in private assets, has already launched a private fund called the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which holds bitcoins. It charges 2% yearly in management fees and is open only to accredited investors, which for a single person means more than $200,000 in income or $1 million in assets, excluding a primary home.
SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert says the trust, which is available in certain self-directed individual retirement accounts, has gathered $36 million in assets as of Thursday.
He says that some family offices have made investments and seem to treat it as a small part of their gold allocation or their "risky alternatives" allocation, which includes investments such as hedge funds.
Bitcoin "has a binary outcome," says Mr. Silbert. "There will either be a total loss of principal or a very, very high return."
What to Do
Bitcoin's all-or-nothing nature probably means that investors shouldn't treat it as they would a normal asset class at all and instead think of it as they would a "tail-risk option"—one that pays off only if an extremely unlikely event occurs, says Mr. Pal, the former hedge-fund manager.
Again, in layman's terms, that essentially means that bitcoin is like a lottery ticket. Taking a tiny risk won't damage a portfolio if bitcoin goes bust, but will have a sizable impact if it takes off.
What could that payoff be? And what's the chance of success?
Unfortunately, there's no way to know either answer. Mr. Pal believes that if investors do tie bitcoin's price to that of gold, one bitcoin could be worth $1 million. He says that even using a "conservative" estimate of $200,000, the price of bitcoin, at under $1,000, seems to factor in only a slight chance of the coins being equated to gold.
Mr. Pal says he thinks the probability is much higher. As a result, he's put a small slice of his portfolio—between 1% and 2%—into the coins.
"There's no basis to be sure what bitcoin's value will be or if it will even have a value," says Lawrence H. White, an economist at George Mason University, adding that he thinks its value is probably more closely tied to its role in the remittance market than as a gold substitute.
Take note: Bitcoins aren't useful as a way to avoid taxes—legally, at least. This summer, the Government Accountability Office said that income earned through virtual currencies is taxable. Some issues remain to be clarified, such as whether gains should be taxed in the same way as those from commodities or a collectibles.
There are many places where an investor can buy a bitcoin—or even a fraction of one, including Bitstamp and Coinbase. The minimum purchase at Coinbase is 10 cents.
Investors should think of bitcoins as a long-term speculation rather than a short-term trade or a long-term investment, says Mr. Pal. If you decide to take the risk, you shouldn't base your buying and selling on the gyrations of the market or invest more than the tiniest fraction of a portfolio that can be completely lost.
As bitcoin mania unfolds, the currency might turn out to be merely a speculative bubble that bursts as investors lose interest, akin to tulips in the 1600s. But by risking very little, at the very least, an investor might be part of a story that's still told nearly 400 years later.

Legacy media is figuring out how to monetize digital content. One of the few viable ideas is micropayments, but that's hard when the smallest unit in United States currency is a penny and credit cards expect a percentage of the transaction cost to process. They can't process 1.9% of a penny, right? But with bitcoins, you can keep sub-dividing it to eight decimal places or something crazy like that. So it would be the equivalent of a millionth of a penny or something like that. Digital content producers would do well to consider bitcoin.

Yes, CEOs are not known for long-term vision. It's all about the next quarter results.

You might be on to something. When I search for "Coinbase" on the iOS App Store app, it doesn't come up. What gives, Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:55:22
Absolutely. But I'm not sure very many of us can actually have the intense focus to monitor the markets and be ready to pull the trigger 24/7. Someone's making money off these frequent ups and downs, but I get the feeling it's people who trade all the time, not newbies. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:56:36
There is a lot of TA discussion on r/bitcoinmarkets about this. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 22:33:24
It worked for me. I think it took 10 days from the time I mailed the money order to when it posted on my account. No problems.

Chinese government has had it with USD as the reserve currency, especially after the default threat last week. They are on the record as advocating for a new reserve. Bureaucrats or others plugged in with the party are testing BTC to see if it meets their needs. Maybe they like it, maybe they won't, but their decision will have a huge impact on BTC price. (I'm not Chinese, just reading tea leaves, as it were.)

They still must get licensed individually in any U.S. state in which they want to offer their services. This is a huge and well-known barrier of entry to anyone trying to do this. Will be very interesting to see how long it takes them to pull this off, and whether it's even doable. Worth watching...
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:08:37
Thanks for asking. I have no idea what it would take to pull this off, but I'd love a way to access the (meager) credit that I have on my credit card and allow me to transfer USD from it directly into a bitcoin exchange such as Mt. Gox or CampBx. The software could require password and two-factor authentication like Google offers. Again, this may be beyond your scope or even beyond the capabilities of the existing infrastructure but I would pay for this! Also, here's a little something just for asking +bitcointip  0.001 btc verify

Once again clueless politicians waste time meddling where they don't belong while real problems are ignored. Regardless your political views, left or right, you can name issues that demand a lot more attention than virtual currency. 
Cash has never, will never prevent Ponzi schemes, money laundering, investment fraud, robbery, theft, god knows what. No one is suggesting additional regulations (that I know of) on how cash is used. I'm aware of regs such as how much you can carry out of the country, etc., but Homeland Security is not calling hearings on it.
This is just another pathetic attempt to appear relevant by the same folks who brought you the sequester, near-default and gridlock.

You might hear about "day trading." Don't do it. You're going against software written by experts that can perfectly time trades and beat you 100% of the time. Buy and hold is the best chance you've got to make any money. There is a sub dedicated to trading at r/bitcoinmarkets if you're interested.

Range from $99-$132 starting from 2 weeks after the "crash" back in April to just after the "Silk Road" drop. Haven't bought any since then!

I've been thinking about your post all day. Then I read [this]( and I wasn't really thinking about it anymore. It's one of the most remarkable pieces I've ever read, about a real hero who has exactly the opposite of your "problems." I highly encourage you to read it.

Only for "high net worth investors," but interesting to see Bitcoin added to a hedge fund portfolio.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:55:33
Almost missed the reference when I saw BC! Yes, it's bitcoin, but you usually see it as BTC. Thanks!

Not necessarily addressing your question, but I randomly open my wallet client on a regular basis just to avoid the mega-sync sessions. (Not sure if that's riskier, however. Just a thought.)

Another recommendation for CampBx.

only commenting to confirm that the site existed, I remember checking it out, but I never bookmarked it and now I can't find it either.  Must have gone out of business.

I think a more worthy prize would be the Nobel Peace Prize. Dare we dream that BTC could delegitimize the morally bankrupt financial institutions that thrive off inequity and therefore lead to a more stable and peaceful world? What if the poor and exploited of the world could have an economic vehicle that wasn't based on government tyranny but mathematics? What a dream Satoshi had...

So you don't actually trade BTC, but in a "derivative product that reflects the price of bitcoin?" Didn't derivatives (in a very simplistic way) essentially cause the global economic meltdown of 2008? Doesn't sound like something the average Joe or Jane wants to play around with...
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:15:52
Can't argue with how slow CampBX is. They're supposed to be upgrading this weekend, so we'll see if it makes any difference. Thanks, 
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:48:08
yup, that was my experience, too

None of this matters much unless the SEC approves this BitEFT. Anyone have any insight into the likelihood of that, because that's the story. Aside from that, you have two wealthy investors with the guts and foresight to get in early, and take out a big position. Good for them. If BTC goes "To The Moon," they'll be even more wealthy. If it goes to zero, they'll be the butt of yet more jokes, not only getting screwed (some say) out of Facebook but also betting wrong on BTC. I know there are others out there with more BTC, so their story doesn't really mean much unless the EFT gets off the ground. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:56:26
Oh, right. Good point. I guess a disastrous crash might be different , i.e., the price never recovers. Not sure that's in the cards...
@_date: 2013-09-23 21:27:18
Just like with the WSJ mention of last week, anything that exposes Bitcoin to people who are not early adopters/technically trained is a boost to adoption.

However, anyone know how to delete a Dwolla account? They can't do @ for me now, but I can't find a way on their site to delete. Thanks in advance!

FinCen director saying existing legal framework give them what's needed to regulate digital currency. Possibly good news that no more regulations needed! "We feel like we have a pretty good basis to act on already..."
