You are a unique snowflake.
Holly fucking shit your post is worthless.
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:26:46
These idiots with these stupid domains only post this shit to get clicks.
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:50:41
northbridgetimes.com...  Yay.  Another person from India trying to make money off clicks.

RIP Tom Lee's reputation.

Thank goodness you're here to let everyone know.
When are you going to get tired of being downvoted and just go away?
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:28:34
Oh fuck off.
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:54:03
Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:46:58
Both your URL &amp; your username are annoying.
I assume you also have a punchable face...

Their pricing is out-of-control.  I'm not buying another until they fix it.

OP has begun creating fake accounts or asking friends to upvote his posts at this point for his stupid site.
There are 2 posts on the front page right now about the same thing with far more information.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:14:43
The dufus?
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:15:39
Seriously, dude?
Bash already asked you to stop posting.
You are now spammed.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:46:00
At least you got it.

Do not post Roger Ver's scam site shit here!
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:55:17
Stop doing that triple space shit.  You aren't important.
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:59:42
You couldn't even spell welcome right in your post...
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:01:00
Yay.  Another person who has no idea what is going on and has a new website.
Go away.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:12:08
Alt-coin shit.  Go away.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:01:43
Blame the damn futures markets (I wish they were never created).  Look at all the XBTUSD long positions that were liquidated just on Bitmex:
For example:
Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 9,999,191 @ 6378

Dude, just go away.  You are fucking annoying.

The time it takes to download and verify the boostrap.dat file exceeds the time to do a normal sync at this point for most users.
This is why the torrent support was discontinued by bitcoin.org.
The recommended process is to allow for a normal sync with your client of choice.
If something has changed, someone please correct me.

It's a reference to the movie Alien and a line that Newt has.
Other than that, it's dumb.
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:28:02
This is a scam site run by Ver.  Don't post this shit here.
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:32:02
You are a piece of shit loser.  
Fuck off you degenerate ass hole.
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:11:37
That's not how things work, dude.
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:55:46
Fuck Tom Lee
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:27:23
...but where the English located?
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:53:42
Nobody should ever download a bootstrap.dat file from an untrusted source.  Further, downloading a bootstrap.dat file is no longer the recommended approach in any situation.

Front plate?  No fucking way - ruins the car.
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:58:39
Maybe both articles.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:10:34
That is NOT a valid address.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:29:28
Go away.

That is not how bitcoin/Bitcoin's valuation is determined.

What about if sense you had some.
Holy shit that broke my brain.
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:03:07
Dude, just stop posting your videos here.  In case you missed it, nobody cares.
Look at your own post history.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:09:58
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:57:50
Go away.

Tom Lee is worthless.  I'm tired of seing him getting jerked off on CNBC.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:09:12
Apparently you are incapable of reading.  The link you clicked said submit link/text NOT about price.

@_date: 2018-09-18 08:35:51
Every idiot has a crypto domain and posts here.
I'm guessing you are Indian.
