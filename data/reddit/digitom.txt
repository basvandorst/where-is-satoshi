I have a slight feeling that the types of people that hang out in coffee shops aren't the type to mob bully someone into submission.

I bet all whales buying Bitcoin are boomers. If you are a pleb now youll be slightly less of a pleb later if you own Bitcoin...still a pleb

People should stop focusing on "-isms" and focus on corrupt individuals who are at fault. The whole planet is pretty much capitalist.

Comment of the year.

Some good dialogue here, but the pacing and delivery is a tad slow. There is also not a whole lot of comedic camera angles or movement to keep the viewer interested. Example: 
Your two main characters are also a little too plain and don't hold a lot of interest looks or personality wise. Judging by this video, they are yuppies trying to get mommy's money. I would have made these guys absolutely spoiled little shits...maybe not even knowing what blockchain even is....but hopping on a bandwagon. Or maybe they just heard about it in a bar bathroom while getting high or something. I think if you added more flaws to these characters they would hold more interest.
Production quality looks good though. Hope you guys continue to work on this.

after sending 250 twice...then waiting 30 days...you will have a limit of 1000. Everyone is shitting on coinbase here but sadly it is still the cheapest option if you want to use credit card. Correct me if im wrong.

Ah okay thanks! This is starting to make more sense to me now. Great community here.

Yeah I'm leaning towards dumping 2x as well... Based on what I'm reading in this sub.

You didn't miss the boat. Crypto is still fairly unpopular

You should always do some kind of work regardless of how much money you have. If you base your life around monetary value vs building skills you will eventually become depressed.
