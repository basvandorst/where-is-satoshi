Govts are trying to regulate bitcoin but they cannot since its decentralized and that is why the future for bitcoin looks not so great and a large number of people are staying away from it. Nobody knows when govts declare them illegal. So if bitcoins are backed by some like gold which will make it a centralized system like NoFiatCoin-XNF, why should people you and me have to worry. I mean everything will remain as it is.

bitcoin are backed by money launders, drug trafickeks. That is why its future is uncertain. For some kind of stability, It must be backed by something... may be gold or something else...

That is a good question but such cryptos like XNF-NoFiatCoin are already in market. So it must be workable idea for bitcoin as well?

No in a particular scenario if bitcoin price falls down dramatically say 50% then having it backed by bullion will not have much affect. Oppose can also may happen but possibility is least. 
Can i draw parallel to bitcoin being backed gold to XNF-NoFiatCoin being backed by bullion ?

Right that if bitcoin is backed by something like bullion, It will become a centralized platform and counter-party risk will also play a role. 
So does it mean that bitcoin will always be like this and can never be backed by anything or any organization which create a better confidence among people who generally stay away from it. Also, having something/ someone backing will help bitcoin avoiding any possibility of being declare illegal
