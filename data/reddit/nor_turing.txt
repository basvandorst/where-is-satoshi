I am not sure if you are joking here. But in case you are not, Satoshi talked about the core design, which is of course not the same as the Core development team. 
In my personal oppinion the game theoretic principles underlying Bitcoin breaks down, if scaling is not at least to a significant degree handled on chain.

Imo that is a truth with modifications. The vast majority of significant contributions to core comes from devs working for Blockstream. It's logical to assume that we will only see features and improvements aligned with the business model of Blockstream (which btw. at this point in time is unknown).

It's USDT (Tether) and they're traded at 0.974 USD for 1 USDT on Kraken as I'm writing this.

Then imagine the fun in countries where it is illegal to hold bitcoins.

Simplified explanation. 
1 mine produces 1 marble a day. Only 1 marble totally can be produced a day, even though more miners enter (they'll just have to split the produce).
Every day Anna, Bob and Charlie trades marbles. They trade a lot. They create a lot of volume, but not necessarily any price changes.
Every day 2 new people decides they want to own 0.5 marble. They buy it from the miners.
One day the marble production halves. Only 0.5 marble is produced. The 2 people now have to enter a bidding war to get the 0.5 marble produced. Price increases and equilibrium is reached.
The price increases makes the media write about marbles. More buyers enter every day. Maybe a bubble will form.

I just wanted to test their content posting system. I don't own any steem coins. So why not post an ad for Bitcoin :)
Btw. what is VESTS?

I get nervous each time I hear about exchanges. 
So for what it is worth, I just tried to withdraw 1 bitcoin from my Kraken account. It took less than a minute before I saw the transaction in my wallet.

What a wonderful gift. Well done!

It is not that unlikely. It will happen on average 1 in every 131072 tries. You could play reverse Martingale and hope to get lucky - at least you won't run out of capital as quickly  (just remember to stop before you bankrupt the casino).

I asked Humble Bundle why they stopped taking Bitcoin not long ago. Got this std. response: 
*Thanks for contacting Humble Bundle Support! Alberto here. I am so sorry for the delay — we're a bit backed up with the success of our recent bundles. We're doing our best to answer tickets in the order they are received.*
*I'm sorry we don't have your preferred payment method enabled. There are a lot of factors we need to consider when adding another payment method, and we're working on expanding the options we have available. I'll absolutely make the suggestion that we explore options to support your preferred payment methods. Where resources are limited, we can't make any guarantees, but I really appreciate you sharing your feedback with us!*
*Let me know if I can assist you with anything else. Thanks again for reaching out to us, and for supporting our unique network of developers, gamers, and charities! With the support of awesome customers like you, we've now raised over $70 million dollars for charity.*
On a positive note, I paid an independent contractor in Bitcoin last month.

Spock has been a guest on TNG (in Unification), not as a Science Officer though :P
He had a fun conversation with Data.

If users and price continues to drop, so will transaction fees. It's already happening. I don't understand the OP and many of the comments - it's like arguing against obvious facts:  Of course the fees change continuously based on load, and every time we're close to the ceiling, they will rise significantly, as there will be fee competition between users to get their specific transaction through. 
The 10th of Jan 2017 I paid a freelancer in btc, and made the mistake of only paying 0.000113 in fee (around 10 cents) - it took 14 hours to get confirmed. The 14th of Feb I paid another (0.00021 / ~25 cents fee), which got through pretty quickly. Both transactions were 225 bytes.

You should give him credit for his prediction in the OP quote though, because as you well know, at the time a node were also a miner.

There was a compromise proposal; Hong Kong agreement.
It had a lot of support. But a few people were strongly against. Hard to see another compromise getting more support than Hong Kong. Personally I'd appeal to the people against it to reconsider.
Edit: typo.

In general the trend has only been upwards. So unless you only used Bitcoin for a very short amount of time, or bought in a very narrow period of time during last bubble, Bitcoin would have been an excellent currency primarily going up.

It's definitely possible to get dynamic block size without being gamed by miners. You don't have to have miners set the block size for it to be dynamic. Check out Pieter Wuille's proposal 
A little conservative for my taste, but it's a good proposal.

Used Neteller to buy BTC from Coinimal 2 weeks ago. All went smoothly.

Tell them you agree, but you already sold your fiat money.

Are you sure it is not just your bank robbing you with a huge fee for SEPA transfer. Some banks do.
