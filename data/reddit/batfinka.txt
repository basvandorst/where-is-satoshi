�� But....but....but....doesn’t the euro’s monetary supply go up? so it’s relative  value (to itself through time) DOES goes down .....�� I thought that was its nature of inflation!
The ECB �� would not mislead me, so I must be wrong and stupid....hence I bought more crypto yesterday.
Here comes that darn volatility again.��
Oh well

A subtle distinction for clarity only, but wealthy people don’t (need to) work. Once wealthy, work is then a hobby. Fiat is riches, property is wealth.
1. You work for riches, (rich people are not necessarily wealthy) 
2. invest riches into property (real wealth) 
3. then sit back as the wealth accrues value. (More riches). 
4. Rinse and repeat.
5. Rule the world.

Then kiss my shiny metal ass and make a wish to see a volume spike.....then we might get a rally we can ALL jump on baby!

Re. Renewables substituting for coal.
Your point is generally valid though in this regard requires a bit more clarity.
The article briefly mentions distribution losses from hydro power plants (being remote) from my memory these losses even in the UK can be in the range of 80%. 
Also a significant figure is mentioned for non-utilised hydro energy in the province far exceeding use by the bitcoin network.
This is also true for many renewable systems. However future network improvements and storage technologies resolving this problem (and thereby validating your position) should not be ignored. 
Ultimately (imho) bitcoin will still need to improve its design so as not to be as inherently wasteful as it is, by employing the PoW calculation as it does, else be over taken by ‘better’ tech.

Excellent analysis and debunking. Read it, remember it and pass it on.
One or two caveats, bitcoin still employs an unnecessarily wasteful calculation for its PoW. This can easily be substituted for a more ‘useful’ calculation as other forks have shown is possible. An alternative calculation would further increase the perceived network value against its power consumption. This would be a more energy efficient design and with my eco-designer/analyst hat on is required for a pass -as I despise waste.
And let’s not forget not all crypto is bitcoin. the growing number of not-so-shit-coins are demonstrating MUCH lower power consumption for their admittedly less tested networks.
There is one small mention that hydro power is damaging to the environment despite being renewable. This requires more emphasis.
