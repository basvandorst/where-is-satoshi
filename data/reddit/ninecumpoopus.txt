So I’ve been playing with the bot. It’s cool and all but in my opinion if I have manually go in and ask it for prices, I don’t know if there’s much of a use for it. I think it would be useful if I could set price alerts and when btc his a certain price it sent me an automatic alert it would be a lot better for me. Otherwise, good job on the bot. It works great.

I submitted my verification around 15 December, got an email yesterday saying I’m verified. The list is long, hang tight and they will get you done.

Cue anti-ledger rant then finish it with “Isn’t it just a USB stick?”
Come on, you sound Busch League as fuck. Also storing your coins on an exchange is one of the worst things to do. If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your coins. You obviously don’t know what you are talking about, or even doing.

I’m not the one running around telling people a quality product is bad because a few uninformed people got scammed. More people have been scammed and hacked off exchanges than have been scammed with seed word preloaded ledgers. I just don’t think you should be running around telling people a good product sucks when you even admit you don’t know anything about it.

How often does it send price updates

This would destroy the value of bitcoin

Except coinbase is down again wtf

Let’s be real here, the feds already have a crypto and we have been using it for some time. I get paid in a direct deposit to my bank and I make 98% of my purchases with my credit/debit card. Very rarely does actual cash go through my hand. American dollars are becoming crypto beneath everyone’s nose and they don’t even realize it.

You, sir, are an evil man
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:04
I’m on a few but you can’t use fiat to purchase. I submitted verification on Gemini after the great coinbase bitcoin cash fiasco of 2017...just waiting...as usual.

They don’t have you confirm fees before you finalize your purchase? I’ve never used a bitcoin atm so I don’t know
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:30:11
Is this your first Reddit account? Because we only get one, right? One in our whole lives? No one would ever delete their account and make a new one, right? Or maybe have two or three accounts, right?
The only thing “cringe” is your dumbass analysis. And the fact you say “cringe”.

What’s wrong with supporting America? Don’t you love a gdp over 4%, low unemployment, skyrocketing stock market/economy, and tax cuts for the middle class?

Delete your Reddit account then keep that shit fam...wth is wrong with you
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:18:38
That’s messed up. Even if the fees are high they should be upfront about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:40
Gdax won’t verify for me, I don’t know why. I tried months ago and it kept failing so I said screw it. Binance has been on point for me so I’ve been buying on coinbase then transferring to binance.

It’s literally the best resource. Get on google, do your research, and make decisions based on what you find. You can’t research bitcoin enough. That’s what I did when I bought in. I didn’t take random strangers advice. 
Also if you use the search bar you’ll find this question has been answered on this sub more times than there are bitcoins in existence.

If this is the worst thing that’s ever happened to you then consider yourself lucky. Stop looking at prices and go to bed. Tomorrow is a new day.

Here’s the thing, I don’t see the problem if someone wants to create a pro-whatever sub and not allow opposing views there. There are plenty of other mediums for civil and not so civil discourse to happen so if a bunch of people want a place to call their own what’s the big deal?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:17:21
Jesus...you could use any pro-whatever subreddit as an example (latestagecapilitism, for example). Leave politics out of this. Uncalled for, really.
