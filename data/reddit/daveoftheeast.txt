Trying to get the American people to switch to a currency not backed by the federal reserve which cannot be manipulated is declaring war on the USD. Still love it?

That's incorrect, rome had its own currency, Greece dfd, persia did etc and any one who had a substitute for them was eliminated. What bitcoin is abstractly doing is comming out of no where and saying 'hey Americans stop using the USD, the gov can regulate us, print us, centralize us and manipulate us in any way. Come use us'. Informally declaring war on the USD it is bound to collapse.

The USD is not just cash it's also electric, and the problem of inflation is due to the reason that the government is not backing the USD by gold. It's just paper, in ancient history when governments hyper inflated the free market always resorted to gold. In Rome they were diluting their gold coins with copper to fund conquests, eventually people realized that it became fully copper and worthless, then the free market went back to gold. In my opinion crypto is great for the short term because there is a 91% correlation with crypto price In creases and hype, but for the long term I believe gold will come backwhen people realize crypto and the USD is not valuable

This is that happens when you declare a currency war with the governments of the world...

Bitcoin is doing exactly that, this guy just says there not and doesn't tell me why. They are offering the American people a currency that the elites at the federal reserve cannot control. I invested in a lot of crypto but not because I'm a cult follower like you but because I realize that it is all based on hype and when the hype dies down and people realize that crypto is just a bunch of codes that people made to make money the bubble will explode.
