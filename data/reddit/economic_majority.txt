Btcdrak is Craig Wright?

10 transactions per block? How is that even possible? I thought free block space is filled up immediately. 
This is why it's not smart to change blocksize limit on bitcoin. Spammers will fill that extra space in no time and we are back where we started.

It's ok guys. I'm with you!

Anyone who's business model is threatened by Bitcoin and wants Bitcoin to fail would love to see UASF (way more than planned HF)

Yeah let's jump off this bridge, what could go wrong?

I support it!

Saying that chain split is not guaranteed if we get UASF with minority hash rate support is like saying that average person won't pick up 1000 dollars if they find it laying on the road.
Cost of this attack is negleable compared to what potential attacker can earn on shorting Bitcoin. Someone will do it. Maybe even someone who isn't even invested in crypto right now.

Can I borrow your crystal bowl?

It looks like you think the best way to win an argument is to proclaim yourself a winner.
I guess we'll see how is dropping the ball in a couple of months. 
I'm not against UASF. It just bothers me that part of community is downplaying dangers of UASF.

And if we wait few more years we'll probably won't need hard fork at all because most of transactions will move to other blockchains. 
This is definitely a win for decentralization, less so for Bitcoin.

How is this different from opt in RBF?

I really don't know.

If there is infinite demand for blockspace how come litecoin blocks are not full?

You have to. I'm economic majority!

What do you have against those two guys?

"Rusty is a Linux kernel dev who wandered into Blockstream, and is currently trying to produce a prototype and spec for bitcoin lightning."
Trying to produce prototype? I thought it was ready.

So Bitcoin onchain transactions are soon to be accessable only to rich people? Fuck yeah! Screw poor people who are tainting our blockchain with spam transactions. I feel special :-)
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:17:24
Because UASF introduces attack vector where only one malicious block can cause chain split.
Today you need at least 30% of total hash power to do that much damage.
If UASF activates, you'll be able to do it with less than 1%.

You have a weird mind.
