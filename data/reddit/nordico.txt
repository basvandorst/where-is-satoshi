That $400 was a little gambling money; same as going to a casino and playing some slots. 
I now do call options plays in the 40K-100K range.
If you bought some 5-6 years ago I'm guessing you also put in a fairly low amount, as there weren't too many people willing to put down much on a position at the time. 
Bombardier has created the most advanced single-aisle commercial aircraft in the world in the CSeries, and are about to start delivering their advanced Global 7000 large bizjet. Good company. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:26:30
ellis I sold a long time ago; and I only had $400 worth to begin with so it never really affected me not holding, as a few thousand $ is small potatoes. I have gone heavy on 2-yr call options on Air Canada and Bombardier since 2016 though, so I've done quite well for myself. You sound bitter yourself cause you're too dumb to exit a position in a worthless bubble asset that's crashing. Noob.

You dont buy a future (buy the opposite end) to short. Those who sell the futures contracts are shorting. And they're doing it because they can charge a hefty premium to the buyer vs bitcoin's spot price. That's why the futures contracts have strike prices of around $2K above the current spot price.

Gold shot up as USD was devalued over the past 10 years due to emergency low interest rates and quantitative easing. It's since pulled back a fair amount.

Just futures. Selling/shorting futures leaves you at risk of unlimited loss. Buying Put options would have massive profit potential while limiting risk to your total amount spent on the contracts.

If you want the securities law-version answer to this concept, read on. You can provide 'how to process trades' advice to someone without being registered/licensed. However you can't give advice on which securities to buy and sell, or whether to buy or sell. So you could apply the same principle to this concept; that it's okay to tell them how to trade if they've made up their mind on (1) buying and (2) which asset to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:41
'Who is gonna be paying out these short positions?' - the counterparty to the trade loses and pays, but the clearinghouse technically pays out to the party that's in-the-money when they close out their position or the contract expires. But yes the futures market will mainly be institutional players vs. other institutional players. 
'If only these financial institutions had the foresight to hire a paranoid, uninformed idiot like you' - I work in finance, and trade derivatives...lol. why are you so angry.

A commodity-currency that hardly anyone uses or accepts as currency, has no utility or physical form, generates no revenue, and is arguably the dinosaur of cryptocurrencies. Supposedly people want to say it's a store of value now, but if you want to think that way, you have to acknowledge that an 1800%+ gain in twelve months is obviously a bubble. Heck I think gold's biggest gain in recorded history was 400% in a year and it promptly fell 50% the next year.
But it has name recognition so the masses hear about its gains and have piled in in exactly the same way everyone piled into tech stocks on the Nasdaq in the late 90s. All the regular joes, hairdressers, DJs, retirees, etc. I know are 'invested' in bitcoin right now, but none of them care about anything other than what they can sell it to someone else for. This is such an obvious repeat of the tech bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:35

I expect a massive crash this month, yes. This has followed the path of all mega-bubbles in history; I feel we are at the tipping point where everyone is about to wake up. This is so, so overdue. 
If I'm an institutional player I've loaded up so I can switch to a Short position with the Futures. I note most of the big banks aren't even letting their clients access the futures market when it opens up though. If it gets too difficult, I say they're just going to dump anyways. No one wants to be the 3rd or 4th to start liquidating.

Sooo did you close out your position after it jumped? Really curious what happened with this play. Was rootin for you when I saw bitcoin move up in price for a while after you posted; hoped you cashed in and paid off the debt.

You're peculiar.

I originally bought in 2014. And I'm talking about an 80%+ tech bubble-style crash, not just 20%.

Also if you rrrreally want to learn about the underlying biological effects on people during asset price movements &amp; trading, 'The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: How Risk Taking Transforms Us, Body and Mind' is a great read. 
But for now (since it would take a lot of time to read through books), when you have 15-20 mins to spare, watch this: 
It was filmed a few months before the 2000 tech bubble crash.

90% of people buying/holding bitcoin are doing it purely speculatively to sell for a higher price to someone else. This year it's been a get-rich quick play for most. Very few are buying it to actually use as a currency or as a gold/silver replacement.

You're trying to speak reason to inmates of an insane asylum.

Bitcoin is about the riskiest speculative play i can imagine right now. It's a huge bubble and someone in their 80s has no business trying to 'play' the market unless it's pure fun-money they dont mind losing.

Well now you're just being comical. 'Small-time speculator'; I have two professional designations in finance, I work in the industry, and my last personal play was a $20K call option bet from one year ago which is currently up 440%. So keep calling me 'small-minded' but you don't know a thing about me. 
I do know that calling for bitcoin @ $100K is as delusional as it gets. You've been riding the bubble for too long and are now irrationally exuberant and high on your past success. There's nothing wrong with getting in early and making a ton of money, which you did. But you've now left reality behind, it looks like.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:25:21
Just like all the tech companies during the internet stock bubble of the late 90's, and didnt that work out well.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:00:12
Thats generally how bubbles work throughout history. Those who get in early and ride the wave make a bunch of money as the asset becomes irrationally valued; those who are holding when the music stops get massacred. 
You rode it up; congrats. Now reality hits and 'greater fools'/holders get smashed.
And im hardly a 'noob'; i bought some bitcoin a few years back (not as early as you though) and sold after some time. I knew i was just trying to make some money off other gamblers. Had no delusions like you apparently have.

@_date: 2017-09-25 00:14:49
I mean, since this has played out like every bubble in financial history, as low as it takes for general capitulation. Bubbles for assets that don't actually 'generate' revenue fall much further than say, a stock/bond issued by a company that still makes money.
This is a currency backed by no government, that has shot up wayyyyy further than what's reasonable, and just hit its 'shoeshine boy' moment, imo (the point at which way too many Joe Shmoes seem to have bought in for some of those sweet 'guaranteed' gains).

No one gives a crap about crypto anymore. Any institutional holders are just trying to figure out how to unload the remainder without completely cratering the price by dumping too much at once. Of  course, wash trading in the unregulated exchanges certainly helps them do so.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:06:49
Why should it go on a 'bull run' afterwards? Bitcoin real-world use suddenly gonna shoot up after its value dropped 90%? Or are you just assuming another worldwide herd of greater fools are gonna decide to make it their gambling vehicle of choice once more?
