Someone did some stats about a year ago (somewhat not accurate with new user base size) and it was around ~20K subscriptions most subs start to drastically degrade in quality (or at least discussions about that increase rapidly)
I don't think it's a really horrible thing and there are solutions with Multi-Subs. It's the same problem most software projects are faced with when forking:
* Fork and start a brighter tomorrow, but in the short-term be completely alone and possibly insignificant (an example would be something like etc.)

I get folks are still mad about their missing coins and they want to make sure this guy gets a bad reputation, but really I think we should take these times to reflect on the fact that not much has changed.
A lot of people still do not hold their own private keys anymore. Instead they outsource that to a company exactly like they did with MtGox.
We can all debate over the fat man stealing coins, but at the end of the day it's the classic razor of malicious vs stupidity - it's probably impossible to tell the difference.
If you're storing your coins in a third party, including Circle.com, Blockchain.info, etc. you should consider the fact that you are just as likely of being goxxed.

Roger is the legit deal. IMO he's the opposite of a drama queen. Every time he opens his mouth he puts his money down or backs up his claims. When Roger speaks, I listen, because I have yet to be burned by giving what he has a good mulling.
If there is something happening that Roger doesn't agree with, I don't expect to see a post about him complaining or asking others to fix something. I expect to see a post where he offers to fix the problem, provides an alternative, or hedges against someone continuing to fail - all of which are the most reasonable measures available.

When I did this even with a very small business I got a $5,000 operating loan (the smallest I could find) and then they gave me a credit/debit card to access the line of credit that was loaned to me. At no point did I start to use a *consumer* credit card to fund a business.

inappopriately tagged as a virus by antivirus software is due to the trojans
packaging a CPU mining capable version of it. There is no longer ANY CPU mining

* Fast food places don't do this. They bundle the charges up and make them later (Anyone with a habit of hitting the drive through knows that!)
* Most corner stores don't do this. It's more common with small stores. They do this because they have the poorest merchant deals with VISA (probably from violating their practices or having lower volume)
* Some bars do this but it has nothing to do with VISA or credit cards, as they will likely have a minimum drink purchase amount for cash as well. It's just a tactic to get people to buy more / drink more.

Let's keep things simple. I like simple!
* You need a wallet that is easy to use, has lots of features, and is not only installed on your PC in case of emergency
* However, you don't want someone stealing your PC or phone or hacking the website to lose your money
* You need both **cold** and **hot** storage. Cold storage is a wallet that is NOT online and cannot be accessed, whereas a hot wallet is sitting somewhere connected and ready to spend.
* Register on blockchain.info and you will have a **hot** wallet. This makes it easy to spend/receive small amounts of money without touching your cold wallet
* You want to minimize how much you touch your cold wallet. Your cold wallet also needs to be generated offline using a tool like Armory or BitAddresses
* Keeping with the simple concept, you can use BitAddresses to generate some cold wallets. You can keep these private keys from ever touching a computer connected to the network. If you're 100% paranoid you can type them in manually to avoid the devices ever touching each other.
* You can send money anytime from your hot wallet to your cold wallet. Anyone who knows the address of your cold wallet can send to it.
* Regarding your last point of solvency it's a way for an untrusted third party to verify you have what you say you do without risking losing that money. The dumbest way to do this would be to send all your money to someone you don't trust, hope they give it back, and you can all agree you have that money. But you could easily lose that money. Instead we use techniques that send the public keys and verify we control the private keys, etc.
* When you need to pull money out of your cold wallet you can import a key from the cold wallet to avoid connecting it over the network. One way to do this is for example generate 10 private keys via BitAddresses and then send 0.1 BTC to each of them, then import the keys each time to "load" your hot wallet with 0.1 BTC.
* There are other ways to dot his using Armory, but I am trying to keep things simple and avoid using tools. These steps can be done on low-end hardware / old laptops etc. whereas Armory requires RAM etc.

I disagree.
I live in a small city and it's about 20 miles away to get to an ATM that lets me do up to $3,000 daily Bitcoin transactions. It does both buying and selling, and is in a very public place (the mall)
So right now for most values it would be cheaper to just go to the big mall and use Bitcoin to send money, avoid it being fined to hell or frozen.
Now I would like to remind you it didn't used to be like this. Before the AML/KYC laws really started getting applied to Bitcoin it used to be really really easy. There were a lot of people who had bank accounts open and running small exchanges. They would give you a deposit account number and everything happened within a day.
I'm sure as volume increases and regulation decreases (or people effectively work around it, like with the vending machine concept) it will become an even better option.

That's good. I don't like watching a celebrity in essentially a hostage situation, as you can understand (unless maybe that was part of the game; PR agent vs internet?


I think it should be a way to broaden the audience of Bitcoin without focusing on an existing audience. People have some hard-wired dislike for the "club" nature of Bitcoin because it usually is associated with Anarcho-Capitalists, Libertarians, people that "got rich early" making Bitcoin a "ponzi" etc. etc.
Myself,  I am probably not your ideal audience member because I am not very interested in most celebrities. The reason I would tune into a game show is because of the **game**. I mean that in a strict sense, what is the win/lose conditions of the game. I do not watch Wheel of Fortune because I am not interested in the game mechanics behind it. Watching people re-arrange letters over and over with a wheel buffering through the time is very boring for me. On the other hand, watching Jeopardy is something I enjoy because the game is more open-ended and Alex Trebek will crush your soul.
I have not seen enough information to know what your **game** actually is, and through the vague description it's easy for me to assume it could be a very lame social media charade. The article says "games of knowledge and skill" but doesn't give any examples. The example website right now gives instructions to re-tweet for a chance to win, albeit with a guessing portion.

Right now the price being payed for the security/function of the block chain is drastically distorted. About 3600 BTC a day is being spent right now to secure the block chain.
It's expected that over time the real-world cost to secure the blockchain will go down (since difficulty can go up or down) little by little, which is why the blockchain reward halves.
Eventually once we reach the point where only transactions are funding blockchain security the cost should be much lower than 3600 BTC a day as an aggregate cost.
The big deal is that not a lot of people realize how much blockchain subsidy there is right now.

Not an answer to your hypothetical, but an attacker would typically not do this and instead would raise it as little as possible to be above 50%, so that once the network recovers he may be able to try the attack again with a bit more power, etc.

I get where you are coming from here. Originally I wanted to disagree with you because the ad format is so limited in time, like 30 seconds, but actually I think BitPay did something different.
I think I saw all three ad spots they made and they seemed to take a spread:
* The one with the packaging/logistics workers where they say "I accepted Bitcoin with BitPay" while mentioning it saves time and money seemed like what you are wanting. It seemed like an appeal to someone who might ask "Why accept Bitcoin?"
* The ice cream shop one we are talking about seemed like the consumer-style advertisements basically grasping at your attention as much as possible trying to leave any branding or idea in your head. That's why it focuses more on the characters and their personas and silly accents, since that's usually going to grasp our attention more.
* Their opening / overall appeal ad seems to be geared at establishing their credibility so that people have more respect for the scale of their operations now. This is probably to defuse the ideas that Bitcoin is still ran in some guys garage or"these guys aren't licensed", etc.
My point is that I think each advertisement had a different primary focus. I think it's reasonable to do this considering you can't really expect to get multiple messages across clearly in 30 seconds.

Prepaid cards are limited in what they can do. They can't do AVS or ARB most of the time, which a lot of places are doing when they charge your card and they have very small limits with high fees. For example, a $100 visa card will cost you $7 extra (7%) and you can only do that kind of thing up to about $500.
You can use a Wal-Mart card which has a limit of $1000 and can be loaded for much cheaper, and it won't have the same requirements as a bank, but yes there are some people who cannot have a Wal-Mart money card.

While I may not agree with everything you do or how you do it, Amir, thank you for making this post. We've all basically just been ignoring Mike Hearn and the crony crew hoping they will go away, but they won't and now they have status.
We all know that a fast and controversial change will cause a hard fork and nobody is worried about that, as a hard fork has happened before and we will recover.
What I am worried about is the less fast changes that seep in over time, like with traditional government and bureaucracy. Essentially make radical suggestions, gauge the public backlash, then water down as much as possible while still moving forward your agenda, then rinse and repeat until you are at your goal.
Currently the community seems decent at rejecting extreme and fast changes but willing to accept the same change over a period of time in small incremental steps.

There are a lot of businesses that right now have no reach to certain consumer markets. For example, if I am selling some trinkets I made they cannot buy them in Uganda with a credit card easily. Partly because they don't have cards in Uganda. Partly because anyone giving them some form of financial services in Uganda is probably abusing them, probably with collusion of their local state.
So, I disagree. For most businesses it is THAT big of a deal. Most people only have their doors open to yesterday's customers while capital is moving the direction of tomorrow.
**EDIT** To simplify there are a lot of people on this earth right now that do a lot of work and should have purchasing power that currently do not.

This is one of the side-affects of the block subsidy I think. Currently a miner can earn 3600 BTC a day without including a single transaction in any blocks. That needs to change, so that a 51% attacker denying the network service cannot earn anything, which would happen once the block subsidy is lower than the sum of transaction fees in a block.


I think there has been disagreement, but I wrote a paper in 2012 that I posted to this sub about how the block subsidy creates mal-investment and mis-aligns incentives.


We're in a catch-22 now. Even after the next halving someone can still earn 1800 BTC a day not processing a single transaction. Even 15 years down the line they can still earn like 200 BTC a day not publishing a single transaction to the network.
I think the double spending issues are not as big as the risk and reward available to deny service. A bad miner could be accepting payment from say VISA to keep the network not working right while also earning all the subsidized BTC from the network. That's horrible.
But can we change the distribution schedule? That's risky, but a part of me thinks that Satoshi wanting this to take 30 years was a mistake.

If you are really serious about securing your coins grab a spare PC or laptop and use it as a cold storage machine. Install a very small operating system and never let it touch the network. You can keep some money in a "hot" wallet on your PC to avoid interacting with the cold storage.
Things to watch out for:
* Never run an untrusted binary on the cold storage machine. Don't run anything on that machine except the Bitcoin software you are using to sign transactions.
* Never copy the private key to another machine in any way.
* USB devices can spread malware, CD-ROMs too. Most systems have problems in their architecture that make this possible, even if you as a user never allow it. For example, both USB and CD-ROM exist on a bus that have access to RAM. Lots of DEFCON talks about how to do this from various ways in various systems.

Long story short I spent about 30 minutes gambling, won $160 after playing $10 for a few hands of poker. The lady gave me my chips.
I decided before I do anything with the chips I should just cash it out and hold the money in my hands. Once I got the money in my hands I decided my gambling was a success and I should just bail on the gambling part and go to the buffet. We ate like kings and left.

Not really an iFrame but the point is that Stripe is one of the only options besides PayPal that make it easy to accept CC payments without PCI compliance or re-branding issues like PayPal.
Stripe provides Stripe.js, a Javascript library that aides in storing customer information on their servers and gives you a token.
Also the real point here is that Stripe is very easy for merchants to use and many are already using it. Most users start an account, enter their bank account, and then install a plugin for their merchant software.
BitPay and Coinbase offer similar features, but:
* They don't have a PCI compliance thing happening right now, which is good and bad. PCI is a busted setup that doesn't work, but also how companies are treating BTC data obviously needs some standards
* Coinbase and BitPay stay outside the CC realm, so it's "extra" work right now to use them. Stripe can be their one stop shop for all currencies, BTC included.
It's the "full circle" deal here too, because there are a lot of products that bridge the gap between Stripe and accounting software, shipping, etc.

Remember everyone that they did this in Russia a few months back and Russia re-wrote their laws and began making a large state-owned credit processor to replace Visa/Mastercard after making them each pay about $1.5B in deposits; deposits that will be forfeited if they ever cancel service in Russia again.
This seems like the only thing Visa/Mastercard are willing to do right now, probably while being pressured with various sanctions.

When you file you have to pay taxes, yes, but that doesn't mean you have to *register before doing business*. There still is no registration process for filing, you just mark it down and use your tax ID (SSN)


You can use your SSN for the tax ID. When you incorporate a business (again, not required, just a different structure of ownership/taxation) you would get a new tax ID that is not your SSN.


I'm not talking in any way of evading taxes. You would be pretty surprised how many businesses are ran as sole proprietorships.

That wasn't a problem before :)
But as others have said you should look at LocalBitcoins or now that prepaid cards are possible on Circle you can probably get a setup where you buy the card and send the numbers, they cash out the money and then the transaction is settled.
**EDIT** In fact if you can find someone using Circle already that you trust you can have them simply load the card and take a small % as a fee. I do believe that is fully legal as well because gift cards don't have an identity associated with them so you would not be committing any fraud.

This has been standard for the last 100 years. This is because it was realized that lots of people could be charged with crimes that never materialized or didn't even get to arraignment. The name of people and companies would be tarnished as reporters couldn't correct their articles already in circulation and seldom would issue a correction.
You can say it's nit-picking but there is actually a big difference between someone alleged to commit a crime versus someone who has been given an opportunity to defend themselves against the claims.

Unless moors law and semiconductor space stop doing what we have modelled for about 60 years, yes, there will continue to be a gap in these types of memory.


Just more artificial shaping of the distribution. It shouldn't be catering to current memory rates, etc.


What you're seeing is actually most cards just being okay with having memory not as much faster than CPU memory.


That's a difficult question to ask because so many altcoins have odd utility. It could displace Litecoin if it can provide a 2.5 confirmation time while favoring a larger miner base. However, if Bitcoin can ever offer a 2.5 minute confirmation time (via hybrid block chains for example) it would consume the utility of Litecoin.
It's hard to model utility from something as vague as GPU vs CPU, especially while the line between the two is being blurred more every day.

Yes, a miner can include whatever transactions it wants and as another user mentioned the mining of the block and the inclusion of the transactions do not share the same work function. It takes me a long time to find the solution to a block, but accepting transactions is simply a game of maximizing the yield of transaction fees while staying within the protocol rules like maximum block size.
Miners are free to include or not include any transactions.
One thing to remember that I have spoke about for the last 2 years is that we are very early in the "block subsidy vs transaction fee" transition. Think of this as starting at 0.0 and going to 1.0, where 0.0 represents the genesis block where there were no transaction fees and only block subsidy. Over time we approach the 1.0 where the block subsidy is so low that it cannot be represent as value unless we extend the number of bits in a Satoshi.
I can somewhat calculate that number right now by taking the transaction fees from recent blocks and comparing them to the known subsidy of 25BTC per block mined.
Taking the high of the last few blocks mined it's about 0.15 BTC in total transactions for a block right now. We are still very early in this transition, where the primary funding of the blockchain technology is through subsidization of the printing of new coins.
The subsidy will halve every 4 years, so it will be 12.5 within a while, but that won't change much for a few more iterations. What I expect to see is the number of transactions go up through a large growth of adoption, even if not directly from consumers themselves (like institutions that use the blockchain)

But they can police the *dark* web. It's funny when people say this because they don't even know what the fuck they are saying. The "dark web" is actually a somewhat real term, but it exists because there are many more places than just Tor and inter-connections between them.
They don't even know what Tor is or how to stop it and they try to claim they can destroy an entire class of security software, that they admit the government has a vested interest in using.

Most of that is pretty standard and all but the AML/KYC stuff is legit:
* IP address and other identifiers are used and tracked in almost every website you browse, so to prevent legal liability you need to agree/understand that they will have that data. You are free to use Tor or a VPN.
* Geo location stuff is for anti-fraud just like the antiquated Address Verification System (AVS) for credit cards. At least here you are free to not disclose your Geo data.
* AML and KYC is trash, but that needs to be handled overall. Circle is not unique there.

That's not the same thing. Coinbase charges 0% as you approach a rolling $1 million total, once you go over that you enter their percentage based fee.
BitPay offers up to $100K/day for $300/mo at 0% - meaning if you want you can just pay $300/mo fixed cost and not pay a conversion rate.
Assuming you're actually taking in $100K/day that means after 10 days coinbase will charge you their percentage fee, whereas BitPay will charge you $300 total.
**EDIT** It could be the difference between $300 and $10,000

That's not really true. I have a lot of friends that are not super interested in the economy, bitcoin, silver, or money in general - but they see inflated prices and decreased purchasing power. Most of my friends can look back at least 10 years now (since 2004) and agree on a few things:
* Some of them smoke and the price of smokes has went up for them. They pay about double for a pack of smokes now (used to pay $3 something pay $6 or $7 now)
* Neighborhood kids used to take $2 and get a cheeseburger from Jack in the Box ($1) and a soda ($0.50) then use the two quarters to play an arcade game. Can barely get the cheeseburger for $2 now.
* Cost of energy has went up in that time. Many people are now paying $100+ power bills a month. In some areas the power bill has went up so much there are new insurance programs to join to even the price out over time
The average layman totally can see things happening. I'm not even touching on anyone related to the construction industry or the jobs it touched, because everyone in that whole situation was borderline suicidal for a few years.

I don't blame him. I read the 58-page document and they are very vague about this. They call it the "Subject IP Address", they don't specify how it was revealed, and they say it was a mis-configuration of a "login page".
They have pretty much replaced each detail with vague descriptions. A "login page" can now mean either his application code or thousands of applications below him in the stack. I'm not saying they needed to say exactly what line in the source code or what version they exploited, but some basic ballpark like an HTTP header, IP header, etc. Also, maybe use the real header name instead of masking it?
They can later say it was his application code too, and the only evidence of that we have is provided by them with no corroboration. They can change whatever IPs they want or lines of code to put whatever vuln they want into that app and there is no way to tell the difference.

Its absolutely not a scam in any way. The guy who runs it is very clear about how he makes money and has always been completely honest:
* He buys games during sales and sits on the coupon codes waiting until later to sell them. He might buy say 25 copies of CS:GO at $5 and resell them at $13 which is below the stock $15 price at a later time.
* Games that would not make him money or would need to be listed too high are unlisted. He usually unlists games during sales too, so you don't buy one at a higher cost than the real steam store. Guy even says you can email him if you want to buy those sales by proxy sometimes.
* Steam has a system for buying and selling games in bulk. They have a "minimum price" except for titles Valve makes themselves where they can go as low as they are willing to. Any combination of buying and selling things just makes them money overall.
I've bought Age of Empires HD for a good price there as well as a copy of Left 4 Dead 2 and a few other random tid-bits.

No, that's the point of this post. The "right thing" here is what can actually have an affect or make a change. His entire point is that Lawsky lacks the *mechanism* to affect any change. Sure he can write papers and wear a nice suite, but that's literally nothing compared to someone making innovative changes to the system or how people use it.
Innovators have every possible tool at their disposal, whereas Lawsky has only only regulation. Regulation is probably not the solution to every problem, especially problems that exist entirely outside a space the government operates within.

I agree with what you're getting at Peter. I think we've all seen this problem since about 2013 and everyone has had some vision in the back of their heads about how "sidechains" or some other hybrid will exist.
I think about this a lot with a project I work on called RealBay, because it's goal is to index all the torrents in the world. For me the problem is that interests are diverse, and someone who is searching for a torrent of Ubuntu may not be interested in the gigabytes of metadata about TV shows or pornography. (To clarify, RealBay attempts to search indexes with plausible deniability and without putting your search over the wire)
The problem is we're nowhere near having a solution to this problem that people can use. Again, yes, I agree with you and it would appear Gavin does too, that this isn't the final solution. However, nobody is saying we should do this and throw sidechains away or stop wroking to a better solution. The reality is there is no implementation of a superior solution anywhere in sight.

What? Vertcoin is *planned* to use CPU mining over GPU mining as time goes on. CPUs have more memory than GPUs do and the algorithm increases in memory factor over time (see whitepaper:  )


As long as they have a CPU and memory they are playing into the arms race this altcoin has created. A GPU just happens to have the amount of memory needed right now, whereas over time the gap between GPU and CPU memory is large.

Facebook can do whatever they want, like keep the content up or take it down or do nothing and forward the DMCA complaint. Most companies take the action that limits liability the most, which is take the content down and inform the user then ferry messages across to avoid anything from progressing legally. In this case it's Facebook servers that host the content, and they probably don't care much to fight any battles against Western Union.
It would be different if this was on your own computer or server you hosted. Then the complaint would come against you individually.

Why are we hating on Amazon for no real reason? Some things to point out:
* This is a POS system. It can later accept Bitcoin if you want. You may not understand why that is important if you are already living in a Bitcoin-only world, but a lot of brick and mortar stores have use for this.
* Amazon has consistently been trying to break into the brick and mortar storefronts. They understand there is a vastly untapped audience that doesn't do online shopping, and they have a few different things happening to capitalize on that. I remember a while ago they teamed up with 7-11 to make cash-payable kiosks.
* 1.75% isn't as bad as some other systems in this space. Yes Bitcoin can be free and is better, but it also has a drastically smaller audience right now. Many low-volume merchants have agreements much less forgiving than this, easily in the 2.5% range for many depending on how they structure their insurance.

Last time I saw you posting it was about the subject and I was curious if your opinion has changed. I think most of the things you say are pretty good but this is an area we disagree and it's interesting to see why.
Granted I suppose I could have PM'd you but I don't think you or I care to hide our opinions, plus I'm sure you welcome others to benefit.


If willing I'm totally okay with discussing this as if there was not a state or existing law entity to work around. I'm trying to attack the heart of the "is copying stealing?" issue and I think that can be done without tripping over the existing system we all think is broken.


Where did they get that last right? I agree they have the right before they get rid of the property, but withstanding another agreement what gives them the right to the property that was exchanged? What is the concept of ownership here?

Many probably do not, just like they don't with their browser software, phone software, and other open source products.
However, myself and many others, actually do keep up with a ton of the changes in the source code. Also keep in mind that word travels fast about controversial things. I may not look at every commit, but anything that is striking a conversation will be seen by anyone interested in a heartbeat. Keeping up with commit history of projects on Github is what most programmers spend a lot of their time doing other than coding.
An example in the past was the block size change and transaction fee changes. The biggest danger is subtle commits that seemingly do nothing but enable exploitable bugs.


Who would make such a commit? If they are a respected developer in the community, they would be outed probably be destroying their career. If it's some random person nobody has ever seen commits from they will for sure be looked at more closely.
You can get a full readout of any two versions on Github quite easily with most repos. For example here is a comparison of 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 of Bitcoin. I wasn't paying close attention to the repo (although I was keeping up with Heartbleed and the patching at my dayjob)
These changes are very normal and they don't actually change the application logic of Bitcoin. They just change openssl to use a newer version. Looking back at another release from the RC to 0.9.0:
Again you can see many of these changes are trivial, almost all outside of the core code (C/C++) but instead in shell scripts and python code.


As I showed you above the links to compare the commits, that's most of the work. Obviously looking at the commits will raise questions, but Github has an excellent search feature to help with that as well. You can quickly start to see how a change affects a project with hundreds of thousands of lines of code without reading them all.
The last commit on Bitcoin was 18 hours ago:
Another place to see what people are up to is the Pull Request area:
This is where people who have forked Bitcoin make their changes and put a request to have the patch merged.

I mean, if they get out from under that and start showing the world you don't need that house of cards, that speaks volumes and other countries will follow suite. Even if they replace the USD with their own locally failing currencies, that's still better, and long term would trend to using a real money standard.

I'm seeing a lot of people saying run a malware scan, etc. There is a high likelihood that all data related to the attack has been removed. I'm not saying don't look, I'm just saying on that device itself you are most likely not going to get any forensics.
Also consider an attacker may have been looking for all he could steal before making a move, so when you turned your PC he thought he was locked out or "the jig was up" so he began looking through all the data he had lifted.
Try taking a look at other devices on your network. Also, what IP first relayed that transaction (was it yours?) Your PC was off but your router was probably on, so there is likely some meta-data about who was trying to connect to you over and over. You may be able to request this meta-data from your ISP. (Although you will likely only find the IP of Tor exit nodes)
When was the last time you used the wallet that required you typing the password in? If there was a keylogger on your system it may have taken the attacker some time.

Stealing data is stealing data. The difference between BTC and CC is:
* Credit card numbers are absurdly small / easy to predict. Know the branch and a few other details and you can widdle the list down to about 200 or less numbers (Luhns algorithm)
* Credit card verify numbers (closest you get to a private key) are 3 digits and never change until the card is re-issued
* There is no mechanism stopping invalid actions from occuring. If VISA wants they can do whatever they want. They can process expired cards if they want.


As you mention, it's pure security theater. Anyone working anywhere near card data knows this. Most would argue that who think they are secure by a system doing nothing are most likely less secure.


When accepting a BTC payment I would never receive your private key and any payment system do it (like CC does) is invalid / broken by design.


To defraud BTC? They would need a lot more than that. To defraud the CC network they would need:
* A server, like PHP you mention ($50)
* An identity to trash (~$1000)
* Bank account with said identity
* Merchant account
Even newer secure services like Stripe will still let you collect the CC details before passing them onto their server, assuming you don't use Stripe.js (which you should assuming you're not a scammeR)
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:38:10
Miners decide what transactions go into a block (in theory they want all the TX fees so they will take as many as they can)
A block is created by [permutating]( a number in the block header so that it's SHA256 hash begins with a certain amount of zeros. The more zeros needed the more permutations it will statistically take to find a suitable hash. This is the mining difficulty.
Here is a simple and stupid mining algorithm that I hacked together that may help illustrate how mining (proof of work) is done:
	&lt;?php
	$diff = intval($argv[1]);
	if ($diff &lt;= 0) {
			die("ERROR: Specifiy a difficulty
");
	}
	$x = sha1("Header");
	$expected = str_repeat('0', $diff);
	do {
			$p = rand();
			$y = sha1($x . $p);
	} while (strpos($y, $expected) !== 0);
	echo "Found hash $y with permutation $p
";
I named it `mine.php` and you can pass a number to it that represents how hard it is to mine. Here are some examples:
	$ php mine.php 1
	Found hash 03fb4ae9e1654c12a435e2eb073d3f239d3126d8 with permutation 604430604
	$ php mine.php 2
	Found hash 0003b0ded28c1a17b015cb6ee01e71c0f21666be with permutation 1555513375
	#            ^ just happened to find an extra zero here
	$ php mine.php 3
	Found hash 000bb7fd3a6934c7ae2ebfb39b61c0fc5db093fb with permutation 170220838
	$ php mine.php 4
	Found hash 000008f582868bb3d4255687aeedeb4d86aa80ff with permutation 291976356
	$ php mine.php 5
	Found hash 00000f38f003db2f49278da417dcedea4e96e325 with permutation 1241768873
	$ php mine.php 6
	Found hash 000000c8fdb72dee275039b226f039c0fe967417 with permutation 834409871
We can now take the permutation number and combine it with the agreed upon header and verify these are correct, like this:
	&lt;?php
	$diff = intval($argv[1]);
	$p = intval($argv[2]);
	$x = sha1("Header");
	$y = sha1($x . $p);
	$expected = str_repeat('0', $diff);
	if (strpos($y, $expected) === 0) {
			echo "Hash verifies
";
	} else {
			echo "Hash does not meet difficulty ($y)
";
	}
Save it as `verify.php` and we can plug our results back into it like this:
	$ php verify.php 1 604430604
	Hash verifies
	$ php verify.php 1 604430603
	Hash does not meet difficulty (2f68ce59dbfca1aac09e650a1cd9c0aca0d791af)
	$ php verify.php 2 1555513375
	Hash verifies
Notice when we changed the permutation number from `6...604` to `6...603` the hash doesn't verify.
Also notice how the person generating the block (finding the hash) has to do a lot of work, trying many many hashes before they get the right answer, which gets harder as the difficulty increases. However, anyone who simply wants to *check* the hash (proof of work) only needs to calculate one hash.
I've used sha1() because it's easier in this example. It's not a secure hashing algorithm like sha256() is, and Bitcoin makes use of multiple hashing algorithms. Overall though the basics of this example are the heart of any PoW system like Bitcoin.

Never hurts to give the ACLU a call in situations like these. Depends on what you want though. If you're just looking for your trezor back and to move on, call the ACLU and give it a few days you will probably get a call saying you can come pick your property up from someone higher than that officer, essentially trying to save face and avoid any problems the ACLU may be interested in drumming up.
If you want to potentially benefit from the scenario or "stick it to them" for stealing your trezor, contact your lawyer and prepare a civil suite that they will settle before it goes anywhere near a trial.

The current mining difficulty represents how many zeros you need to find. The mining difficulty can go as high as 2^256 (in theory) which would require finding a hash consisting of almost all zeros, which we likely aren't going to do without breaking SHA256() or creating computers that don't physically use matter in order to compute.

Namecoin needs much more love. I just recently started running it and mining it for a new project I'm working on called "RealBay". It uses Namecoin behind the scenes to start looking up a trusted meta-index of torrents. It uses bloom filter lookup tables, etc. to optimize the search. I have relied very little on Namecoin, but because their blockchain is not optimized much they will have to download the entire Namecoin chain just to find the 20 byte DHT hash to lookup :(

I agree with a lot of what everyone is saying, although that may seem contradictory.
Mike Hearn and Gavin are right that these discussions aren't making much progress because if someone proposes a plan someone else picks it apart but offers no better plan or alternative solutions (or offers alternatives that don't exist yet)
Peter Todd is right that Bitcoin is decentralized in development and nobody has a true final say even if they commit and roll out the code, because you cannot force everyone to run that code.
Having seen the Bitcoin core community become more fragmented and frustrated over the last 2 years I think it's clear this isn't going to work. **Eventually people are going to stop working together in this fashion** and instead the miners will decide what changes take affect or don't by running them.
A lot of people probably don't like the idea of leaving it to miners to decide what to run. Miners are the ones risking their time and money, and they are the ones with the most incentive to keep things working. If a programmer makes a change that is bad, maybe he loses credibility or committer access, but he didn't lose blocks and waste electricity for a zero return like the miner did.

If there is not a long-term incentive it won't work. This is actually part of a larger problem, which is the balance of power between miners and non-mining public who are typically consumers. Right now miners could, if they wanted, refuse to actually accept any transactions at all and earn money from it.
When they mine a block they get two things:
* The "coinbase" which is how the first coins ever released were made. Miners make X amount of BTC from the block as a subsidy and that amount halves every 4 years based on the protocol. I think it's still 25BTC or it's halved to 12.5 BTC by now.
* The sum of all the transaction fees. This is any of the transactions that were included in the block by the miner.
Right now that 25BTC subsidy is much much more than the sum of the transaction fees. If a miner wanted they could publish the block with nothing in it and get the 25BTC effectively attacking the network while getting paid.
Over time the subsidy goes down and the sum of transactions will go up (due to volume) but it's an interesting dilemma.

Multibit really needs to be taken off the list of "wallets you can use" - it has far too many ways to mess things up. I have personally had many of the same problems I see others having with Multibit. Most of the time everyone gets their BTC back out and it's just a "fun ride" but sometimes people actually lose it and in general I think it's clear Multibit is not foolproof for many.
TL;DR - Don't use Multibit. Blockchain.info responded and will be offering assistance as they are aware of the issue. Don't use multibit.

No, but it may take time to re-scan your blockchain download. It's rare that bandwidth is actually your bottleneck when importing the blockchain data, it's usually CPU or IO that are limiting you.

A lot of downvotes come from discussions that have already been had a thousand times and anyone who was genuinely interested would easily be able to find them. Many will also downvote you if you obviously don't understand basic economics and have made various assertions.
The reason is because there are a lot of folks that have trolled in the past. Showing up, starting arguments, then once being edified would say "lol I'm trolling".

One thing worth noting is that only Blockchain.info is seeing that transaction. I tried on a few other places and they have never heard of the TX and my node in debug console has never heard of it.

I submitted it manually in my debug console so maybe some more of the network knows about it, but you can also submit it to known "pushtxs" around the web, like this:
The idea is to get other nodes to see the TX and I think it will confirm quickly.
**EDIT** Can confirm the TX is now seen in other places.

If the law was changed tomorrow it wouldn't matter. When laws change they don't retroactively release all criminals convicted under those laws. They didn't even do that when prohibition was repealed.
Sometimes a specific political agent will pardon various people, for publicity mostly, but that's a drop in the bucket. Maybe a few get a pardon while the majority of them finish their sentences (although they may now be eligible for parole)

It doesn't scale. A specialized miner right now can perform millions of hashes in the amount of time a regular computer can do a single hash.
Instead I am try to replace "use some CPU power" with "get another person to participate". The chain itself is secured with Bitcoin via merged mining though.

As long as you didnt delete any of the files or start CTRL+ALT+DEL killing things you are not going to lose those coins. What you're seeing is a combination of:
* You haven't downloaded the chain yet, so your client won't show you information about transactions that are YEARS ahead of what it's syncing right now.
* Your transaction isn't confirmed yet, because of the network reacting to the spammer.
* The directory was changed so the wallet.dat file you copied over is probably loaded, but again it won't see anything in the future that's unconfirmed yet.
If you are fine with waiting for the blockchain to download you should see the transactions show up once they are confirmed and even if they are unconfirmed and you are sync'd up more.
If you don't want to wait or want to get those coins before your chain downloads use another wallet to extract the private keys from the wallet.dat file. The easiest would be use Blockchain.info "sweep keys" feature. The only problem is that things may be slow during this spam time.

One of the problems I struggle with when creating my project is how to handle "vote masking" or ensuring that people can agree on what the most upvoted item is without knowing who voted on what.
What I came up with so far, which isn't a very good system yet, is "vote parity" where each vote has to have someone else vote along side with them. The idea right now is that when you go to vote, other users are selected within the last X amount of time (who should be online) to submit the same vote.
Assuming 2 other people were selected to help "mask" your vote, you would then know that the `total / 3` was close to the real number of votes, and from what I understand users are de-anonymized as the vote count approaches the sum of all users (which makes since because assume there are 10 users on an entire website and there are 10 upvotes, you can deduce that all users voted on that item)
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:06:51
It's fine yes. When you generate a wallet you are holding the *private* key. To receive money you must give someone the *public* key (wallet address). As long as you keep hold of the private key you will be able to control the coins sent to that public key.

Just because someone submits a ton of crappy transactions doesn't mean miners are very incentivized to process them. At the end of the day you have to remember that someone is submitting specifically crafted transactions of no value and attempting to get a miner to participate by sending them a few pennies.
If miners don't want to process 50K junk transactions for a few pennies I don't blame them.

I guess it really depends on if the sum of unspent outputs from the spam transactions is greater than the sum of transaction fees waiting to be confirmed.
Each unspent output right now is `0.00001` BTC, and it appears you can fit about 5,500 into a block, which will net you `0.055` BTC.
Going back a week or two to before all this madness started let's look at a block that was mined right after an empty block (for whatever reason) which is a good example of a block that should be pretty full of normal transactions with fees:
It has 1006 transactions in it and the fees summed to `0.17225846` BTC, and it was only "half" full at 550KB. 
**EDIT** Also as nice as all that is, looking closer at the transaction OP linked to, it has no output and the miners are not recovering any of these coins. They are actually being destroyed as sent to an invalid output it would appear (Which says "Bitcoin to pluto!")

Downvoting me wont change reality. You titled this post:


And nobody is claiming anything was actually stolen, just an idea. No property was stolen. No schematics were stolen. No binder full of secrets was stolen. 


That's a really fancy way of saying an idea. Again, you're not claiming they stole any particular property just information you had shared previously with others. I'm also willing to bet you have no reason to expect those people not to use your idea, ie. you didn't sign a non-disclosure agreement with all 150 of those people, etc.


It's not a snazzy way to say it, it's just what has happened. You are blaming others for your own failure. If this idea was that important to you, don't share it with others. If you still want to share it with others and you think it's important they don't copy it, then you need to get a NDA with people you work with.

Exactly. All a larger block size does is make the spam exit the mempool faster and go into the chain, which actually affects non-miners (anyone looking at new blocks).
What is "spam" in the Bitcoin network is a mostly subjective question. Also consider that without changing the content of a transaction at all, what someone considers "spam" can change. Given arbitrary evolving rules about what spam is, a transaction you sent yesterday could now be considered spam.
I find it similar to how many of us Americans want to create anti-immigration laws, that had they existed at the time of our arrival, would have stopped us from ever being Americans in the first place.

They will always get the block reward, even if they include no transactions at all. Their incentive is to include the maximum sum of transaction fees.


Another miner already got those fees. The inputs are spam transactions that were already confirmed in a previous block that are going to addresses with known private keys. They are scraping those private keys and consolidating the outputs.
If the miners just wanted the money and not to compact the database they would simply submit a bunch of transactions moving those coins into their wallets while at the same time taking the transactions in the pool with the most transaction fees.

"resistant algorithms" are mostly snake oil. The relationship between space and time can always be manipulated.

No. The only affect this can have is if you go to send those coins it may take longer for them to be confirmed unless you send with a higher fee.

These are transactions being created by miners as charity. They are spending known worthless outputs so that miners don't have to keep record of them anymore, thus mitigating the bloat creating by the stress test / attack.

If Bitcoins were traded as frequently as dollars, silver, or gold you would know the value a lot better.


Bitcoins themselves are only a unit of exchange, like in a credit card account or even a US dollar. Besides the goods and services folks offer for a dollar, what can you get with it? Another dollar. The same is true of Bitcoin.


Very few barter directly like that, because it's a hassle. Instead they attribute value of the things they are exchanging into a common medium, like cash, silver, or even beads. It's a lot easier to know that each goat is worth 5 beads instead of constantly making a new comparison of value each time.


Maybe he will find someone who is willing to sell some beef to him for that Bitcoin. Assuming adoption is not the problem this would be as simple as cash, but let's assume nobody at the Mall wants to accept any Bitcoin. He can exchange it for dollars online or via a merchant, just like you can with silver or gold today.
I buy silver, but no shops in my area will take it as payment for goods or services. But since the price of silver goes up so often I keep some of my savings in it, and exchange it with a guy across town for dollars every once in a while. He has to make some money doing this, so I try to avoid doing it often.
If that guy was trading Bitcoin as well this would be a much easier thing. The closest I have found is Bitfloor.com with cash deposit and checking withdraws - but those are on hold right now :(


I hate to be that guy saying it, but what does a dollar get you in RL? You can't melt down your dollar or eat it. Even with silver, for me it's just a store of value for trading. Yes there are people in the world that wear it for the shininess or melt it down and make conductors out of, but that only changes the quality of a store of value it is really. I still don't expect to melt it down and do anything with it myself.
Bitcoin, silver, or cash; it's really only worth what someone else will trade for it.

I have used Bitfloor and while it was down even BitInstant although their fees are much too high for cash transactions. Bitfloor did get hacked, but that doesn't affect me since I put my money in there for only a short period of time.
What I do on days I want to deposit Bitcoin is before I leave for work I go to the site and start a depositor request. I usually work in small amounts like $50 at a time. Both times I did it went through Wells Fargo, once through Bitfloors own account and another time through Trustcash, Inc.
On BitInstant the BTC will come into your address as soon as the transaction is processed. This is within an hour for me as long as you did it during 9 AM - 5 PM business hours from what I can tell.
With Bitfloor the money goes into the website ready to be converted to BTC. Unlike BitInstant no conversion rate was locked in and you must log into the site and convert your USD to BTC on your own. If you are impatient you can do a "Buy Now" conversion or if you think you know how the market is playing you can try to issue a buy order at a specific price.

* If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
* There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.

Bitcoin uses the same security principles that other critically important software, like payment processing, are currently using. It also uses them in a much more secure way. For example, by forcing all transactions in the system to be never-changed there is a long chain of integrity that every has verified millions of time over. Who verifies transactions of Visa, PayPal, etc.

**Are we talking about increasing the maximum limit/supply of coins?**
Increasing the limit of coins isn't the same as traditional money printing. Real money printing is homogeneous, so each unit is worth the same. Bitcoin isn't the same. To print more coins in BTC you do not diminish the value of other coins, but simply increase the resolution of coin space.
As a simple example let's imagine a United States that has $10 and a BTC network that can address up to 10 coins. When the USD prints another dollar they diminish the purchasing power of the previous $10 by 10%.
For BTC to increase the supply of the money they would need to change the precision of how small a BTC could be traded. So if they increased the precision by 1 the reward blocks would generate a 0.01 which would actually be large enough to grant a coin that increases the supply of money.
**What stops a developer from pressing a button and getting coins?**
There is no "secret" to Bitcoin. There isn't some master password that only the devs know. They don't have any power in the network that you wouldn't have. The only power developers have is to make new features, which can include augmenting the network, and hope that people like their clients enough to use them. The only way to generate coins is to generate the solution to extremely number intensive number problems. If someone can do that in some clever snazzy way then they are welcome to all the fruits of their labor, because they just broke every security principle in classical computing.
**Are we talking about a rogue or malicious developer committing something and then releasing it to the public? Like a backdoor that stole your funds?**
This is the human factor. Luckily the source is open and there are many competing clients, so the central points of failure are mostly non-existent. If someone publishes a bad client it only affects those that use it, just like porn sites and just about everything else in the world.

It's also refreshing to use Bitcoin stuff to make real purchases because there is so little nonsense. If I go normal electronic websites, I am blasted with ads and cryptic deals, junk products being offered to me because of agreements to get rid of stock, etc.
With BitcoinStore it's just the me, the money, and the merchant. Very little BS is distracting me. If there are ads on that site I didn't notice them.

I agree you have less time, but you have to spend it wisely. Very few successful projects are the all mastermind creation of one person. With limited time you need delegate your work to others, which can requires capital.
Firstly, you're working a lot so in theory you can spare some capital yourself to hire others; however I know typically this is not practical. Have you tried throwing together a basic business plan and fielding for investors, maybe even Kickstarter or other crowd-funding tools?
You've got to pick between quality and minimum viable product. If you want this to happen ASAP you're going to have to delegate work to others which will probably end up being lower quality than what you would have done on your own/with a very small team.
Although you can mix-and-match like I do. For things I can't trust other developers to make at a quality I demand I use some of my time on my paid time off to work on that, but I try to delegate as much as possible to others either for pay or via investment in the outcome of the work.

You need to get more people involved I think. Here is a neat idea I came up with:
Setup a twitter account and everyone who tweets something like  or  gets a much smaller entry into the raffle. You could either give them fractional entries (like 0.1) or make the normal paid entries give more like 10 entries per bitcoin instead of 1.
If you want to control the scope of the tweeters cost you could make a "sub raffle" of people who tweeted and then pick X from that and enter them into the paid for raffle.
With more people talking it up I think you'll have a new house soon.

Software isn't IP directly the patents you can file in some areas of the world compose Intellectual Property rights by those who respect them and where they are enforced. No patents have ever been filed and the creator has used a false name. I'm sure there are others that have or will file patents trying to claim the innovation of the block-chain as their own, but in the end it will be a moot point as this implementation will always exist to defend those patents. They will most likely still be awarded patents though.


IP as a whole there is a lot of niggling, but I think software patents are an area where more agree it's causing problems even if we have different ideas about solutions. 


That's putting the cart before the horse. Bitcoin end-users aren't interested in problems with IP rights that may arise due to external third parties. A lot of people that believe in markets are interested in Bitcoin because it gives them a framework to check and balance the global economy to avoid exactly these kinds of abuses of power.


The doesn't make sense to me. Bitcoin is not software that is copyrighted and distributed by a corporation that has strapped on Digital Rights Management (DRM) software - so there is nothing to crack in that sense. The Bitcoin clients agree on how the software works and anyone using it in a way that isn't in that ruleset doesn't get accepted in the network, so "cracking" the network in that sense by altering the client logic doesn't make any sense either. The only way to "crack" the network is to find a way to alter the block-chain history, which is a an extremely well understood problem specifically crafted to be hard to do and always gets harder.
**EDIT** Sorry, I didn't mention this is because Bitcoin uses SHA-256 hashes and public-private key cryptography using the same elliptic curve algorithms as most secured systems these days like HTTPS in your browser.


That's not how software development or security analysis works. Yes we have threat models, but in yours we should consider that our network is fully "cracked" and any security principles we rely on broken. Of course with assumptions like that you could conclude dire results, about anything!
Take the same argument you're inferring and make it against PayPal. The only difference is really the factor centralization. Under your threat model the entire world of computer security would be broken.

Haven't tried these notebooks, but as a guy who has tried and has friends and co-workers with many "Open" laptops, a few words of warning:
* Check the history of any vendor selling Linux. Some are really bad at supporting it, even with the best intentions
* Check if the hardware is actually running open driver stacks. Most of the time I've seen people drop $1400 on a System76 for example, only to get stuck with crappy drivers that lock up and they just say "tough shit"
* See how they will handle device failure. For whatever reason 3/5 of the notebooks I've seen come from vendors supporting Linux arrived dead.
* If something doesn't work return it and ask for a replacement. The dead on arrival notebooks wouldn't get past POST, so they called support. They authorized them to open the notebook over the phone and check if the RAM was not plugged in correctly. While this resolved the problem, that notebook has had weird boot stalls ever since.
* Wireless devices suck
I'm all for Linux, but I'm harping on the fact that vendors that claim to support Linux really well and charge a premium don't seem to do a great job. Ironically, I've sat along side and bought really crappy low-end Dell products and had much less problems. I think it's because a lot more people have the devices, so the hardware gets supported better even if it's not open.

Culturally everyone in the US seems to be okay with being tracked until it backfires later, but I've accepted that and it's not really a reason I dislike smart phones. Having tried to use them without irritation for 10 years:
* Live in somewhat rural area. Service always sucks. Gaps, holes, breaks, etc. Unless you're in the city (like when I'm at home or work already on a network) you're not able to reliably access the network
* Lots of voodoo. Download caps, upload caps, throttling.
* Because of the voodoo you never know how long something will take,  if it's the signal or throttling, and basically you're left with a device you can garuantee does SMS which is not really why I bought a smart phone
* Android is changing all day and night and uses Java so it seems to get slow all the time. iTunes is playing police and holds crazy patents and has invested in keeping the market from advancing without them.
I have tried a lot to use smart phones but they always fail me. I find myself getting irritated when I try to use them and they don't work quick enough, and really I almost always say "screw this" and wait until I'm on a desktop to do anything. The whole "on the go" doesn't really fit for me. If I'm "on the go" I'm probably doing something and futzing about with a phone for 30 minutes to _try_ and accomplish something I can do on a desktop in 5 seconds is frustrating.

They would still be valuable because we could exchange them (even though the network never connected entirely) but they would become scarce because the resources needed to generate more coins would be impractical.

As an example, a developer trying new things has to run a *test network*. This is a network that is configured to run with really small numerical problems that can be solved with low-grade computer hardware. This network runs entirely independently of the main network for testing purposes and the underlying principles of Bitcoin ensure that money cannot be transfered between the two (because they are entirely independent and referencing a transaction from one to another would not exist)
The difference in the difficulty between the two is extremely large.

I agree it's worth keeping an eye on. But I don't really see this as a genuine effort.
In my world there are two types of people. People that actually are trying to get to an end, like in this case want decentralized currencies and basically want the financial system to disappear as much as possible.
The other types are people who are more concerned with keeping their existing means relevant. I think this company making centralized hardware tokens is the most watered down fake attempt possible.
Might as well just slapped a sticker on their existing physical currencies that said "Now with 20% more digital"

My point was at this point I am inclined to use a cheap phone and not expect it to do much besides SMS.


If someone sells me something I prefer to use it how I want.


I'm a J2EE developer :) It's a great language and it has great use cases, but it's virtual memory management has and always will be slow without extremely specific application tuning. Android has UI hangs because of it.


Feature fragmentation is the  concern of the platform. Android 2.2 phones are still being sold in this city as well. You even admit in your comment by saying get one version and stick with it. This is the definition of a changing platform.


At this point we're saying have a smart phone because sometimes it can work in a shitty service area. Guess what, I always pay my bill. For things to matter for me I have to have a function for them, and as we've already pointed out most of the features are so watered down or unreliable I'm not compelled to pay $50 to $80 a month plus the subsidized contract fees.


Yes because it's technically as advanced as SMS. However this is a new development in the last 2 years. Apps being allowed in both stores has been problematic up until very recently.


It's about the expectation that I can depend on it. They are completely unreliable.


I'm not inclined to pay for a service I don't use. Why pay a subsidized contract and a carrier bill for basic call, SMS and E-mail? Any crappy phone can do all of those.

Run smaller raffles to start and provide a predictable and consistent growth over time.
If you run a 2 BTC raffle today with 0.1 entries each I'm sure you'd get people to do it. I'm not saying start at 2 BTC but you get the point. Assuming you did a 2 BTC raffle, step it up to maybe 3 and gradually more.

Not sure about that example, but some folks at the meta subreddit did some kind of test a while ago and found that after about 20K subscribers is when most subs start to go through growing pains.
It's not all doom and gloom. I think that the threat of a fork/sub-split sometimes helps mods willing fix problems in fear of a split. For example, has grown a lot over time with some people wanting focus on strategy, some wanting updates on eSports events, and eventually many more casual players that enjoyed image macro jokes. Their solution (like many subs) was to use a tagging system so people could filter out content they aren't interested in. People also started separate subs for SC2 related videos and strategies, but as the tagging system became effective those subs died.

There goes my odds of getting an answer from ya :)


Sorry to break it to you, but this is real life. 


I've seen it in the wild before. Managers don't understand code, and when they get someone who produces 2X as many commits in Github and the graph is pretty, they may not realize that there are 3 other programmers spending their efforts actively removing said bad code.


Almost always people doing the hiring aren't clued into how the success of a product was achieved. Product launched, people got paid, nobody complained, etc.


There is no difference. I never claimed that "real life" was any different, and only YOU are the one making this arbitrary separation.


Seems like a problem that isn't solved at all and would promote bad code that pays more versus the code that should have been written to begin with.


A very fancy way to say the algorithm does almost nothing to solve the problem.


Yes, voting will solve all our problems. /s

Go to LocalBitcoins.com and use MoneyGram. There are many dealers there that have absurd amounts of feedback that sell within hours with $500 as a minimum.
Place the order, someone else will escrow BTC, then you go to the machine and make payment and provide the code and they release the BTC.
Also, not all the crypto malware out there actually works. A good deal of it is simply riding the coattails of actually successful malware. However, as of version 3.0 that malware is relatively good at encrypting and destroying things, see this [StackOverflow post]( One thing I would note is that if the client was not running an Administrator account it wasn't able to delete shadow copies, and you may be able to recover the files that way.

I'll look for some videos but there are two basic incentives for miners:
* For the next 10 years or so miners will get a decent reward for each block they solve. This is called the **block subsidy** because it's the newly created Bitcoin that has never been spent (this is called the *coinbase*, has nothing to do with the company) Every 4 years this amount halves. Right now people get `25.0 BTC` for the block. (If you consider a block is mined every 10 minutes, that's 6 blocks an hour, or 144 blocks per day, at roughly `3600.00 BTC` (`$900,000` at $250) per day. That's their current incentive.
* The block subsidy will never truly equal zero. It may be so small it cannot be represented by 8 digits of precision, and therefor cannot be sent/received in the Bitcoin network, but it will never be zero. (This means in theory we could extend the precision beyond 8 digits and new coins could be printed, albeit at epsilon/small values)
* Every transaction includes a **miner fee** (which can be zero, but then the transaction probably wont be included) and the miner gets the sum of all the fees. Over time it's expected that the sum of miner fees will replace the subsidy, until one day there is essentially no subsidy and the Bitcoin is an open market of transactions with fees the users select

If you read the paper you'll see pretty quickly their attack doesn't work on *exclusive* caches, which is what AMD processors use. It's still possible a more complex attack across multiple caches could exist, but this method of attack makes heavy use of the *inclusive* nature of Intel caches.

Beyond that databases are designed with normalization in mind, especially large systems that have to scale with lots of writes, like social networks. In the more "pure" immutable form the database becomes simply a journal and all your logic is moved into your SQL queries, whereas in the more denormalized view the query logic is imposed at write time.
My point is that the immutability and normalization are separate from the actual permissions.

The shorter the time the more volatility you will see in the difficulty, the longer the re-adjustment time the more stable the difficulty will be.

Not too long from now the subsidy will god down to `12.5 BTC` per block, and within 12 years it will be `3.125 BTC`. Even if the tx volume is only 5,000 by then that's still `$0.16` per transaction.
You could be right about it being 20 years, but I'm kinda in the 10-15 year range because I think transaction volume will continue to grow heavily.
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:33:32
Again, I understand the *macro* idea you are setting fourth, but in terms of cause-and-reactions I can send a `0.01 BTC` fee or a `1337.00 BTC` fee and it won't change the difficulty.
Also miners can choose to not increase the difficulty if they collude, however that will likely not happen unless nuclear disaster, etc. My point is that there are also macro scenarios where users can have as much BTC as they want and the difficulty won't increase from increased transaction fee revenue (or increased block reward, which will never happen)

Use LocalBitcoins.com - they do a lot more than in-person meet ups. Overall you have some options:
* You can use MoneyGram to buy the BTC from a trusted seller. You go to the machine and create a money transfer while the BTC is held in escrow on LocalBitcoins.com (Downside is MoneyGram will want $12 for fast transfers and like $6 for 3-day transfers, but it can happen anytime of the day)
* If your bank is supported or you are willing to get an account at a supported bank, like Bank of America. These banks allow customers to trade money between each other. This is usually a lower cost than MoneyGram or Western Union.
* Put an order to buy BTC in person on LocalBitcoins.com - I have little success with this unless I'm in a super populated area, and even then the turnaround time is bad.
I've done some $100+ transactions on LocalBitcoins.com with trusted sellers.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:58:57


Bitcoin has no limits. I know that's not what you want to hear, but there are no limits for how much coin I can send you or how much you can receive. There are tons of limitations in the traditional banking system, sorry.


There are some interesting solutions for transactions that are less than 10 minutes, but that's a much larger discussion and I think most of us are looking forward to either altcoins or a hybrid-blockchain that offers tradeoffs between security and confirmation time.


Those aren't problems with Bitcoin, sorry :(

It's entirely protected by freedom of speech. If we need to do the same thing with transactions as we did with brainwallets, then so be it. If I have to essentially murmur a fucking chant to send you money I will and it will be protected by speech.

says no, but I think he's more or less saying the current source code and difficulty adjustments are specific to attempting a confirmation every 10 minutes, and if a single person tried to do differently they wouldn't get very far. (and wouldn't obtain consensus easily)
It could be changed, but it would have a security tradeoff. In particular shorter confirmation times would be more insecure, to the point where we saw Feathercoin actually being broken once.
Some think the answer is with an altcoin or an overlay network (like Lightning), and some think that one day Bitcoin will provide multiple "hybrid" blockchains where the users decide how much security they want versus how much time they are willing to wait.

Depends on if things are denominated in USD or BTC entirely. My pseudo-metric of decent there is that it's still orders of magnitude more than transaction fees. I'm not doing math correctly right now, but a 25 BTC reward right now with about an average of ~500 transactions per block. To compete transactions would need about a $12 fee, and if transaction volume double it would still need a $6 fee. I'm simply alluding to there being a cross-over point as the block reward approaches zero.

Helping Bitcoin grow is awesome but please everyone be careful not to create mal-investment that will just disadvantage growing companies.
For example if you're buying honey at the store right now and decide to start buying some honey in BTC with other folks, then a few weeks or months later everyone stops buying honey in BTC. The poor bastard making the honey might have scaled operations up, only to not sell anything :(
If you have to actively come to the decision to start spending Bitcoin, there is probably a reason you weren't using Bitcoin to begin with. Let's fix that problem instead.
Right now it's liquidity is probably the biggest problem (where do I get bitcoins?) But you're focusing on *spending*, so it begs the question, why weren't you spending your coins to begin with? My guess is that it's more expensive for you to buy many things online with BTC than to walk down to the store and exchange cash, without having to pay shipping. Also consider most people are holding BTC as a long-term-store-of-value (savings)

Others have mostly hit on all the important points, such that Ripple isn't a blockchain technology, etc.
A lot of people don't know that Ripple pre-dates Bitcoin by a couple of years. That's right it was being worked on before the Bitcoin.pdf paper was even released!
What I'm saying is that Ripple is a fundamentally different beast that was never designed to be decentralized beyond a few "supernodes" that their company picked. I don't fault them for playing the cards they were dealt years ago, but their efforts have ran the course and it's really saddening that they can't see this and have stooped to the level of pandering for state assistance to stay relevant. That or they are fully aware of how displaced their technology is and still pander.
They're either overly negligent or malicious at this point - neither of which anyone is interested in cooperating with.

Be very careful. I've personally witnessed the company I previously worked at throw away $150,000 on a product from oDesk developers that was "90% finished". Every software developer that ever looked at it made it clear it was completely unfinished and unusable, and the code was thrown away when the project was moved in house. They did this twice with two different development teams.
In particular what framework does the PHP code use? If the developers made their own framework you may have a hard time getting people to work on that code without high costs or requiring the original developers. What documentation is there about the system?
Again, without documentation and a custom framework you may be stuck at square one once the original developers move on.
**EDIT** I'm not trying to discourage you I'm trying to give you advice to help avoid sinking costs. If the answers to the above questions are "No" then you probably should find a third party to verify what your outsourced programmers are telling you. If you want my assistance for this let me know I would be happy to help at a low rate.

I'm not against people knocking on doors and soliciting, given there aren't signs posted and folks leave after their pitch is denied. My only irritation is a lot of sales people are misinformed about how to do their job and end up upsetting a lot of folks.
For example, you have *nothing* to gain from pestering someone who has already said they aren't interested. At most you could leave a flyer, but pitching to them again is a waste of breath and increasing chances of having something thrown at you!
However, I think BTC for the consumer will probably skip that stage and go right into the cornershops as prepaid cards for the demographic that the door-to-door people would target.

I'm not anti reddit I'm just been actively monitoring social media platforms for the last 8 years. In particular I watched users migrate from Slashdot to Digg and eventually to Reddit and the various reasons for why these things happened. Slashdot became less popular than Digg because it was limited by editors, and Digg became less popular than Reddit because you could only post into subs made by Digg and people eventually disagreed on what Games or Technology were, and only Digg appointed moderators could have affect. Reddit allows anyone to make a sub.
It's improved a ton, but along the way we find that there are similar trends. Over time subs get bigger, and as they get bigger their interests widen with their audience, until one day pictures of kittens are on the front page of your previously sub you went to for in-depth conversations. Everyone there now wants them, and you're the minority.
What can you do though? It's the same problem as open source software development. Sure you can make a new sub (fork) but that sub is going to start with no audience just like a fork of a project will start with no other developers. Similar to how vote-splitting works now efforts are divided and the overall results are worse.

If you ever expect consumers to donate to Bitcoin like this, then there needs to be a custodian that ensures the donations are spent on changes that reflect what consumers want, ie. ensure that someone isn't just adding bloat to the code for a bigger paycheck.

That's a bold claim and should be backed up by a link to a post, since you say it happened here or within the Bitcoin community. I'm guessing you're not able to provide any proof for the claims you just made?


Yes, it's still baseless. You've not proven anything and only made claims. It's your burden of proof if you're going to make the claims.


I've been a part of this community and witnessed the birth of Seaons Outpost and donated to them in the past. I'm located across the country from Florida though, but I support the idea of having an open housing community like they do. I guess I'm just retarded.


Actually my guess is he setup any incorporation in a way that balances getting donations without evading taxes or having double taxation while not accepting new liability with the land they are on. You have to remember the county they are in doesn't like them doing this with the land, and if you were incorporated in certain ways you may have more rules and restrictions on how you can use your property.

Firstly, I'm not a Bitcoin expert. While I've read a good deal of the source, I have no commits to the project currently.
From what I know the function of mining is to:
 a) Provide a way for BTC to avoid getting stuck in something akin to a local minima. Like if everyone lost their wallets at the same moment, we'd have to mine new BTC to facilitate trade.
 
 b) Validate some elements of the distributed Bitcoin system. Miners are invalidating / validating hashes, which lends computing power to keeping network secure (more details greatly appreciated here)

Technically the Genesis block contains copyrighted material, and it's sourced allegedly from a country without copyright Fair Use.


You cannot have a court order against "everyone" or "anyone". You would have to take someone to court or file a cease and desist against a specific entity. In this case you could try filing against the core developers or Github, but neither host any of the materials and unlike a torrent site they do not "deep link" into the network. The closest you could get probably is stopping Blockchain.info from hosting the transaction page, which also probably wouldn't happen because mirroring is somewhat protected by the DMCA.


Mining on the existing blockchain doesn't require reproducing the copyrighted work of previously. If the current accepted block has the entire movie of The Matrix in it and I mine a new block, I could have done so without ever actually possessing the copyrighted movie, and my newly published block will not contain any copyrighted information.
However, I expect over time we will see multiple chains and more copyrighted material associated with it.

Your gains are limited by the fixed coin limits.
@_date: 2011-09-07 02:31:02
This is all limited by the fixed rate of finding new coins. You'll never make more than the protocol allows, and after the first 21M are issued we may never have this problem again.
Also respect the drastic difference in scale of the pool of miners to the entire network. I think the combination of that pool being small and the incentives being limited in a deterministic way decently mitigate the threat of a single party taking over the system.
However that's not to say there couldn't be a global derivative network later where folks exchange rewards for not validating some transactions, which could likely in some scenarios affect &gt; 50% control.
**EDIT** P.S Either way, excellent topic and analysis! I'm not trying to be combative or disagree on the merits of liking the idea of Bitcoin. That's my honest opinion from a programmer/mathematics perspective.

Even if it does not go above $10, the network effect of buying under $10 will have the price approaching $10. As the supply decreases the price will increase with each buy under $10.

Bitcoin is a MONETARY system. We're discussing the creation/printing/marshaling of money - not the prices.
What reason do you have to believe that we are discussing how bitcoins growing supply is causing changes in prices?


Yes, just not very much at all. The amount of new gold entering into the system on a daily basis is very low, which is why it holds value so greatly. Compared to other money/good that doesn't hold its value because the supply is constantly increasing.

Not that I advocate Bitcoin or have an investment in it, but I find it so ironic that people are constantly counting it out and looking at it like it's disabled when it has something no other currency has: no central control.
We all know and agree that central control causes currencies to fail at some point. This whole "You'd be playing the roulette wheel" seems off. I cannot model the random desires of currency controllers, while Bitcoin is easily modelled. I don't know if that's an advantage, but claiming it's less predictable is invalid I think.

Don't use micro instances though, as they get burst CPU and IO speed. If you do, your initial blockchain import is going to be painfully slow as you're marked as a noisy neighbor on the cloud.


Machines are cheap. If power consumption isn't a problem (meaning you can use older hardware that is less power efficient) a machine to do this cost less than $50.


Assuming you are okay with SD storage and waiting a while for anything. Again, unless you are interested in power efficiency this is probably a waste of time and money.

I disagree with that. It's not very anonymous to go to Google and sign in with your real-name e-mail address. SSL doesn't really work due to problems outside of the actual TLS technology (DNS, re-directing to plain HTTP, see Moxie Marlinspike's tools and talks) and an exit node (the last node in Tor that talks to the clearnet) can begin to correlate your activities.


This may be a nice tip but I would like to point out this has absolutely nothing to do with Tor or anyone tracking your IP address. If you're using Tor your IP address will already be obscured and you do not need to use any mixer unless you want to make the movement of coins across multiple wallets harder to track. I think it's worth pointing out these are different goals.


I would advise against most users manually configuring a SOCKS5 proxy. The Tor Project has a lot of details about how IP leakage can happen and how misconfigured SOCKS proxies as well as applications that don't securely support proxies. Instead of using a SOCKS5 proxy simply use Tor Browser Bundle and use a web-wallet for funds not stored in cold storage. When accessing cold storage you should not be connected to any network.


Again I advise against using techniques like this because DNS and other problems the Tor Project outlines can leak your IP address.

I feel you :( As others have said you should try LocalBitcoins.com and do a cash trade. I recently did this and that site has changed a bit over time. When I first used the site years ago it was only for direct meet up cash trades. You posted a buy or sell advertisement and then met someone in public with the BTC held in escrow.
Things have changed a bit over the last few years. LocalBitcoins offers a lot of payment types now and not all of them are in-person or cash anymore.
I was in a bit of a bind the other day and decided to "stress test" by selling $100 of my BTC within an hour. Basically I wanted to post the sell order and get the cash from a local store within an hour.
It worked.
I posted my sell order for $100. I actually posted the sell order incorrectly first and they helped me out linking me to an existing buy order offering what I wanted. Because I wanted everything to happen within an hour the only real option was Moneygram, which charged $12 to send the money within that time period. Localbitcoins took a $1 cut.
I think it's a fair exchange of services for $13 to be in such a hurry and not want to reveal any information. Due to laws I was asked for an ID number when I cashed out at a ATM-like machine, but I'm certain it wasn't validated before the transaction was processed (I could have told them my ID number was 12345)
If you're doing trades during the day there are other less expensive options on LocalBitcoins than Moneygram. Some require you have a bank account and some simply require you go into a bank and use an existing account. From what I can tell the more identity you reveal the cheaper the transaction cost, which is why the Moneygram method was more expensive.

Just reading over the code and thought I would make a few notes:


In PHP require, include, etc. are language constructs, not functions. There is no reason to surround the code in parenthesis.


This will clear the cache even if `clearcache=0`. You may want to try using `!empty($_GET['clearcache'])` instead. One nice thing about `empty` is that it's a language construct, not a function, and will not emit errors while attempting to access keys/members that don't exist. I mention this because a lot of coders use `isset` for the same reason, but `isset` will return true for any non-null value.


Don't include a trailing PHP tag for code that isn't expected to output anything. In this case your HTML output is being done by the included template above, and by including this trailing tag you are needlessly outputting a space. This may not seem like a big deal, but it will lead to HTTP headers being sent before you expect them and sessions potentially being broken. Zend themselves are the ones that advocate this. A better example of a `?&gt;` that should be removed is in `functions.php`, since you don't expect that to output anything to the browser.
Other than that the only problem I have with the code is that it may have problems double-writing to the cache file. This can be fixed by using the flags provided for `file_put_contents`, see this Stack Overflow question for how to do that if you want:
(It's essentially just adding the `FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX` flags.

StartCoin is an interesting idea but I don't think the method of coin distribution is valid. I'm not a fan of proof-of-stake style things, and I think they will ultimately lead to artificial value. Bitcoin works a lot like a meritocracy, if you don't do anything you aren't going to be rewarded. StartCoin distributes coins to anyone with &gt; 100 coins, which seems absurd. They also try to incentivize velocity by rewarding people who transfer the most coins. I can think of many ways people can collude to game such a system, and it seems to create more problems than it solves.
I think a better plan would be to build something on top of Bitcoin that simply does most of what this is. It's actually an idea many have had and it's not a horrible one. Companies want to give users coins essentially for means of trading on social media. They don't want to simply give out BTC directly, because usually there are conditions and pools of money.
TL;DR - Doesn't need to be an altcoin.

Nobody, that's my exact point.


That's true. There are more men in finance/trade overall.


It could be related to the amount of risk associated with the line of work. Women typically are not found in as many high-risk jobs. What is considered high-risk may have changed over time though.


I can't take credit for the entire comment base of Not about gender equality or damn near anything else.
Women are welcome to participate as much as they want. I'm certain there are dipshits online that have anti-women views - we just ignore them. There are lots of women in open source projects on the Internet. Look at the Dolphin emulator project for one notable example of a woman that pushes out some awesome code, she's a very well respected committer over there.
Real gender equality is about removing the gender barriers and fostering free-association.  I'm not interested in essentially creating mal-investment of targeting a specific group of people for the wrong reasons, AKA there is no reason we should be treating anyone different because they have a penis or a vagina.

I'm a big Bitcoin supporter but I don't accept Changetips for a few reasons:
* I want folks to tip that money to good content like YouTube videos with QR codes, or Github projects, etc. There is more value in that than stupid puns, and the karma-whoring is already so bad without monetary incentive.
* I don't like how Changetip is implemented and would prefer a solution where tips are kept in wallets we control. I don't support it because there is nothing "Bitcoin" about it and could be implemented without cryptocurrency. (It could be implemented with debit/checking if the artificial fees were removed)
* I personally don't need the money. I'm certainly not rich, but I don't want to take someones money if they could make better use of it than I could, and I know of many projects that could make better use of it than me, such as Sean's Outpost.

The computer program you are running is a contract. If you change it, you're not working in the same contract as us and have created a new agreement nobody has signed yet. People only continue to run the version of the contract they want.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:24:53


Well, in theory it's already been done a thousand times, we just never care to even run those versions of Bitcoin. I can re-compile my version of Bitcoin right now changing all the constants and start running it, but nobody will be in the same blockchain/world as me.
I am going to emphasize the difference here between Bitcoin and your traditional bank. When you sign up with a bank they give you a legal contract. That legal contract can be broken, but it's on you and the Bank to detect when it's been broken and enforce the contract. If the contract changes in motion it's also the duty of you or the Bank to nullify or update the contract legally. With Bitcoin your contract is the protocol, and if it changes the party that has changed the contract will have disassociated themselves.


When you say "re-programmed" we typically discuss a few different scenarios:
* The worst is called the "hard fork" and happens if the community and everyone drastically disagree on how something should happen. If/when this occurs it means that the community must quickly side with one of the forks. The network will keep operating, but this would happen if there were two very popular versions of Bitcoin miners that don't agree on the protocol rules. Anyone can keep running whatever version they want, but the version with the most mining adoption will basically win a hard fork.
* The second worse is called a "soft fork" and has happened before. It basically means that things don't agree in small ways but overall they do agree. It's usually caused by a small bug.
* Lastly we can add *new* things to the protocol or extend it in ways that won't break the existing rules. 
The first two examples are just people not agreeing, either intentionally or unintentionally. The last one is more interesting in this discussion in my opinion.
For example, how could one change the 21 million coins to a higher number? One could change all of the mathematics behind Bitcoin, but it would cause a hard fork to actually change the equations. A better question to answer is why do coins stop being printed in the first place? What is actually happening?
When a coin is "printed" it's because a block was mined. Blocks give you X, where X is currently 25 BTC. This value halves every 4 years. Eventually it will be 0.00000001 and dividing it by two will yield a number lower than the lowest number in Bitcoin.
So right now the mathematical precision is keeping Bitcoin from "having more coins" unless we hard fork and basically start all over. In theory the mining can actually continue forever, and we just keep printing smaller and smaller amounts of coins. From an inflation standpoint it's pretty brilliant, because it's well understood you cannot print yourself out of inflation.

While I love the technology behind the scenes I don't think the global pirate marketplace is going to be affected much by this in it's current state. That's not because of the technology, it's because of how the pirate "economy" works.
The US, UK, etc. make up a very small amount of "commercial" interest for pirates. Most of their efforts are collaborations between small distribution networks in countries where Internet is slow or media is restricted, or both. Content makes its way out in waves and consumers pay to get that content in waves. Swapping 1TB storage drives is more efficient for these scenarios, and it's what they're doing right now.
I can see some private trackers that the US and other first-world countries depend on implementing this, such as UFC events. But, I'm skeptical, because even those are available within an hour of broadcast with tens of thousands of seeds.

No, because it requires inter-operating with the existing bank system, which is an inherent risk. Ever wonder why you see so few credit card to BTC operators, or when they do show up they disappear almost instantly?
Credit card is the worst, because someone can make a purchase and charge it back. The merchant loses the original purchase, and is charged a fixed-cost in addition for the chargeback most of the time. The BTC community (thankfully) has given up on trying this.
Checking account transfers aren't as bad on the surface, but ultimately are the same beast. They are reversible up to 60 days.

Even with proper savings it's scary to quit my job and hope I'll find another one within the amount of time using my savings, and that's not counting an injury or something going wrong.
*Note: If you're saying unemployment go away. Fucking scam and I would rather get a job than play their little games, preferably without paying into this ponzy scheme. *
I have some money, but not enough to start a business on my own. With Bitcoin I didn't even need any capital, as my business connects interested parties that have capital instead.
Now I've got things moving along and basically I know that once X amount of stuff starts happening on my website consistently I can reduce my day job working hours.

* Constant population compared to exponentially growing population (probably what would get us that level of tech)
* Existing gold is not used, destroyed, or lost


The market can respond to a different rate of allocation, it's not ideal, but the market can adapt. Let's assume that 1 ton of gold is mined globally today (just simple numbers, not real) and 100 years from now we develop technology to begin mining gold from space at a rate of 10 tons of gold a day. There will be a volatile point as the market has to find an equilibrium to adjust for the inflation of their money supply, but assuming that the next day roughly similar 10 tons are mined the market will get what they expected.


A decentralized crypto currency has to represent a proof-of-work mechanism. Bitcoin uses SHA256 hashing. You postulate a technology that can mine gold from space that destroys the scarcity of gold via technology, and one could postulate the a technology for Bitcoin that breaks SHA256 hashes (not faster hashing power but actually breaking the security of the hashing function)
Gold has no creator, wheras Bitcoin has many. Patching Bitcoin is simple, but patching Gold is impossible.


Unless one continues to develop new technology every day increasing the order of magnitude of gold mined, I find this inaccurate.

That's actually the definition of fiat, "by decree"


I am really amazed at this comment. Just above he points out how US is a system of fiat by decree, and you are **forced** to pay US taxes - thats where it gets its decree. He turns around and has the audacity to say that people **voluntarily** agreeing on value of a good is *fiat* ?!


Please tell me more about how something that can be printed and speculated to hell could fail. I agree the market has speculators, but no where near the amount in fiat markets.


Those are kinda PR stunts, but that's how things start. Everything was a startup at one point.


Because there is absurd amounts of **demand** for them. Are you living under a rock?


Oh, well, in that case then all blue pens are red and we're done with that. This is quite the claim, with no rationale or proof.


Probably a bad idea to put all your eggs in **any basket**.


It's true people that continue to denominate savings in USD and other fiats will lose value over time. Great argument for bitcoin against fiat. Oh, that was your *supporting argument*?!

Bitcoin can help that a bit because it makes it easier to pay for things or use escrow without getting chargeback scammed later, but most of these transactions can stay cash and don't need to be "online"


Bitcoin is great for that.


That's an adoption problem. Tons of people do drugs and not that many browse it while tons of people are injured in drug trades.


 Black markets can be good, but free markets are optimal.


That's not true at all. If they use their existing credit cards they trust them a shit ton not to sell their card data or charge their card multiple times. Bitcoin would enable actually trust-free transactions that are NOT happening right now.


Because they trust them not to do things said above and ship the products. With Bitcoin you still have to trust they ship things but at least the payment part is taken care of.


Most people would prefer NOT to accrue debt. This is more true every day I would hope.


News is entertainment for most people. All they care about is the money. If Bitcoin is useful to them and saves them time/money or gives them an incentive it will be adopted. If the purchasing power of their currency, such as USD, goes to shit compared to BTC they will use BTC.


Bitcoin can't solve all the problems in the world. Over time if the USD tanks and BTC doesn't they'll be happy to switch.


Same was true for the Internet which is a part of every day life now, taught in schools, and used in about most places in the world. They adopted the Internet because it gave them an advantage over others that didn't. The same is true of Bitcoin adoption.


That's a bunk comparison as my Grandpa would call it :) MasterCard took the hard part out of doing something and provided it as a service to consumers. Other companies are doing the same thing, and there are even crossovers that do Bitcoin in the "1.0 finance world". Hell, I'm currently on the waiting list for a BTC credit card and on the application for the reason why I am requesting it is precisely for the reason that I can give it to my grandparents! I would prefer to load a card with my BTC whenver they want cash to go out to eat or pay a bill without wiring them money or doing a transfer.

Also, LocalBitcoins.com always has high prices. My comment **specifically** is about the **combination** of fast, cheap, and anonymous. LocalBitcoins gets the anon part but is neither fast or cheap. BitInstant is fast and somewhat cheap but sometimes not anonymous.

Gambling addiction is very real. I am very glad I have been lucky enough to learn with Bitcoin, a method where I can gamble a fixed amount and learn about my addiction. My total investment in Bitcoin gambling is about $50 total, but I know based on my behavior that I could be a gambling addict. My moderation and rationale go out the window. Again, I cannot stress how awesome Bitcoin is for me because of this. I am very careful about how much Bitcoin I buy for gambling, and since it's separate I know if I'm going to the bank more than once a pay period I'm wasting my money.


There is a difference between throwing money away in front of others vs playing the odds and having a good time with the stats/odds. My guess is this is the first time your head started running some numbers "for real" and falling to the fallacy of odds


I find this odd, because for me this is the area with the most friction. I've never bought a single BTC, and most places do not offer exchanges that small. Typically I buy $50 worth of BTC at a time and play with it over my 2 week pay period. The idea of taking $500 or $1000 in BTC to gamble is absurd. After reading what I have I can safely say you have three options:
* Stop using Bitcoin or gambling all together until you have more discipline
* Get serious about a spending limit over a period of time. Mine is $50 over 2 weeks. That's $3.50 a day, and I justify this by basically saying I won't buy an extra cheese burger (which is usually a lie or me just being too lazy)
* Have someone else you trust act as your bank. Give them your BTC holdings and they will help you learn your limits.


It's really important you understand that you and only you are responsible for your actions. SatoshiDice simply runs a website and offers anyone the game to play, like a giant well in the middle of nowhere. It's the fool that throws all his money into the well and begins to scream at the well.


Lots of folks do BTC loans and would be sympathetic to your story assuming you can provide some kind of credibility. Expect to be requested identifying information and possibly even collateral. This will still be much better than a bank loan or payday loan, which would run closer to 30%


Not to say you're in an awesome spot, but seriously this is nothing. In a traditional casino you probably would have been extended additional credit or in someway compelled to play more. This usually gets a lot worse and never ends. With Bitcoin the problem is left entirely to you, which seems appropriate since you created it (no offense)

As it stands right now it looks like Bitcoin itself cannot actually solve the problems of commerce on it's own for mainstream users. Waiting 10 minutes, wallet security, and other pitfalls have made it very likely that most users will probably interface with Bitcoin via a service provider. At the end of the day I think most people probably won't even know about Bitcoin itself but the servers built around it. The disruptive nature will stay though, because it will force others (VISA and crew) to compete.
So in one sense it's likely we'll all have some global agreement of value (like Bitcoin) but exchange rates and local service economies probably won't go away, leaving what most people see as not a one-world-currency in that respect.


While I don't have much use for Altcoins currently just changing the parameters of the time in which it takes a transaction to be recognized can be utility for certain uses of currency. That's what Litecoin does, but I think Feathercoin took it too far. But the concept of having a solution for less secure transactions that are faster has value.

As another user pointed out it depends on a lot of factors, but the estimations some people are doing that show the **order of magnitude** gains are based on **market capitalization**. The idea is to assume that an existing currency, like the USD, is displaced by Bitcoin. Then it''s essentially algebra to determine what the price in USD of BTC would need to be to support the same economic base. I think with USD the basic numbers come out to about $500,000 per BTC if the entire US economy shifted to Bitcoin tomorrow. Obviously, that won't happen, but it shows that even 1% could easily get us to $5K per BTC prices.

I disagree here. I have had discussions with the Foundation since their inception. I asked them very specific questions over e-mail and got troubling responses, much similar to what I'm seeing here now.


That is a claim you have made with no proof. He published documents taken from their website along with an opinion. What do you think is sensationalist or alarming?


Core members of the foundation are working with companies that create tracking databases because it earns them more money. They can't do business in the US unless they play by those rules, and have incentive to make those rule favor their existing business strategies.


People are preparing to implement. In theory the fork could be near, so it's a hot button discussion. Equally valid we're just stating our opinion, so you're point is moot.


Malicious and stupid can be hard to separate. I don't think the foundation are inherently bad or against Bitcoin, but a large cooking pot of problems can brew things like this. Everyone has different interests and economic background.


From the e-mails I had with them they offer vague responses about "protecting" and "helping" Bitcoin. Similar vague responses I get from corrupt politicians unwilling to be direct.

I expect layman to see it as more "legit" as well, but eventually they will realize it doesn't have utility. For example, a Bitcoin user will instantly send money to someone while I'm sure this network will have all kinds of internal routing, remittance, etc.

Just lead by example and keep asking them *when* they want to buy some of *your* Bitcoin. I do this all the time and I have a few people at my work that completely denounce Bitcoin. I just show them the price of Bitcoin from time to time and ask if they want to buy and tell them how much they missed out on since the last time I offered to sell.
Since buying BTC has been harder I haven't offered to sell and a while ago one of them made a joke about buying BTC and the people at work who are pro-bitcoin kinda all chuckled and said "Ya I"m not selling any anytime soon"
@_date: 2013-01-03 20:34:27
Also MultiBit can get screwy and if not careful you can seriously screw up your wallet. I did this while betting too fast on SatoshiDice and basically had to import the wallet to blockchain.info and wait a good while.

Currently the short-term solution / workaround is to use a client that only stores things that it needs to relevant to YOUR wallet. MultiBit and Electrum do this for example and some other "light" wallets.

lol wut


Umm, the goal of a currency in an economy is to handle resource allocation / distribution not "grow". It only needs to grow or be divisible with respect to the size of the user base.


My guess is that in this dsytopia you suggest any form of human labor would be absurdly expensive. Yes, you say they have automation, but that's not a 100% end all. Someone made those machines, and I'm sure machines break, and even the machines that repair the machines break. There is a human somewhere doing (albeit far less) labor.


"wreck" your economy... because inflation is low / almost gone? What?! They must have some pretty fucking good drugs in the future too.






Okay I'm done lol

@_date: 2013-02-12 22:41:10
I tried to use BitMe in the past and I found them to be not a great website. Their FAQ and process doesn't (in my opinion) make it clear that this process **is not automated**. They expect you to scan your receipt and send them a picture via e-mail, something they show you after you schedule your cash deposit. Like you, I sat on my exchange for about a day waiting for it to automatically clear thinking I had to only contact them if there was a delay beyond 24 hours.
I contacted them on Twitter and via e-mail and on the bitcointalk.org forums:
I only used their site for that one deposit. It's a clear fail on their part in my opinion and they could easily solve this and other problems, but they don't seem to care much. I think it's just some guy that runs it in his spare time and I wouldn't be surprised if it disappears sometime soon.
Now I use ZIGGAP.com - it's a bit higher or a premium but it's fully automated and they are quick to respond in real-time with your questions and concerns. They also offer the chase bank deposit, which is the method I prefer since that branch is closest.
@_date: 2013-02-02 01:12:46
PayPal is a scammers paradise is why. I recently heard about ZIGGAP.com from the bitcointalk forums, so I popped into their site. They do a really good job of responding to stuff and support in general, so I asked the guy:




























Looks like if you can get a MoneyGram they will do it in Canada.
@_date: 2013-03-24 03:19:19
I can't tell exactly what your concerns are, but I'll take a stab in the dark:
* You seem to put a lot more weight into a 51% attack than is warranted. Take some time to read up on what [is and is not possible with this kind of attack]( It's complex to arrange scenarios where this attack yields good results via double spends compared to how much it costs to launch it, and to continue the attack (and continue to make double spends) is very cost prohibitive.
* Someone buying all the market but not spending. The normal elements of a free market are at play here, but there is actually some additional safegaurds in how Bitcoin works. For example, the currency is distributed over time. If through some magic someone could convince everyone in the world to sell all their BTC to them for free (the worst case scenario) it wouldn't change the fact that in 10 minutes 25 more BTC would be "printed"
Most of the problems attributed to banks are actually the fault of government giving special privilege to the banks. Bitcoin has nobody to nudge elbows with.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:49:13
I'm currently one of them :) I cancelled all of my accounts and stopped using banks in 2008. I was lucky too because I moved most of that money in silver and sold during a good silver market in 2010.
I routinely run into people who are having a real hard time saving money, but they've got lots of bank accounts. Then I ask them what they have a bank account for, and usually it's for saving money. How's that workin out? Oh they took all your money after the overdraft? Oh that card didn't get charged on time? Oh they didnt post that check in time and you had to pay them all your money? Oh, but you still insist having a bank account is a great idea and a way to save you money (while you are broke) GOOD LUCK!
**EDIT** You guys are welcome to ask me any questions about how I do things without a bank account.

Bitcoin is not owned or operated by any group and nobody has "special" powers. Ripple has users that are more trusted than others. The end result is another money printing system.

Mainstream media segments are not shown to educate folks in-depth. They are given very small exposure and very limited time to make their appeal. This is very common for mainstream media. They pretty much only show people involved in current political activities or releasing new products.


Considering they have no idea what Bitcoin is or what "setting it up properly" means you are assuming they think  it would be hard hard, and that assumption is based on ... nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:02:44
That's true I only care if someone else will pay me for it, but the only reasonable way I have to model that is by the utility and scarcity of the good. If Bitcoin did not have scarcity then all the utility in the world wouldn't matter much. Your statement is just more abstract than mine.

Thanks for the link, but I take issue with some of what RMS does. He's after the right idea but he has an odd view of the idea of "Freedom" He also is in total support of a State that takes your money, hinted at the end there with "We want people to pay their taxes"
It's almost the same thing really. He wants certain ends and disregards the means needed to accomplish them. He wants free software for everyone, so he makes a license that depends on copyright / the anti-thesis to anything truly Open Source, in the name of Free Software (a superset of Open Source)
Either way he's a nice fellow.

Many places that liquidate BTC take upwards of 2% (ZIGGAP) 4% (BitInstant) or have markets with drastically higher buy rates (BitFloor)


I don't care how much someone makes - I care about the utility / usefulness of their service/product in comparison to how much I am spending versus my alternatives.


Umm... What? Bitcoin is a method of exchange it has nothing associated with it that is close to anti-corporation etc. Nobody has special priviledge in the BTC world, what are you complaining about?


Actually it is like there are no other exchanges [that people trust]. People are in no way compelled to use MtGox, and using them is not easy - obviously folks have  *chosen* to do this.


And when problems arise and they have to pay for something to be solved, what should I expect? When MtGox got hacked they covered their losses, and they've been able to grow their business to meet demand. How will this website scale to demand or handle a problem that requires capital?
Also the methods of transfer (Bank wire) aren't the same as an ACH withdraw. There are higher fees for international bank wire. Ironically you will likely eat more money feeding the traditional banking system using a "No Fee" exchange

I think business models built around people not copying your content aren't the greatest.
**EDIT** And by extension this affects your service. For example, what's to stop me from starting a website or a Freesite or Tor hidden service called "CoinUnlock" where I simply undercut your site. If it says 1 BTC I pool together 5 buyers for 0.2 BTC and after X amount of time it gets open to everyone via a torrent or something.
My point is DRM is an absurdly failed model.

I think I'll steer clear of Apple products if I have any privacy concerns. Also this looks very vaporware:
* Domain registered yesterday (with a privacy gaurd via namecheap)
* No prototype, demo, or video
* No code (although claims of wanting/being open source)
* One "screenshot" - which appears Photoshopped  Either way it shows nothing important and just tries to say "hey we're real!"
* Not much in the way of any images: 
* Claims "You can deduct your donation when Spark is released." which looks really scammy

Well I get that it's a slogan / gimmick, but the idea of Bitcoin is certainly not a one-size-fits-all solution. Altcoins exist, other currencies exist, and I think a lot of people in the community would say that the whole idea behind Bitcoin is disrupting the monopoly on money.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:04:44
I have used BitFloor before they are good. Never keep your money in an exchange though, clear it out into your own BTC walllet
**EDIT** While I have a small soap box I would like to let everyone know why I vouch for BitFloor. I don't work for them or anything at all. I am just impressed with how he handled the whole $28,000 hack. A lot of people would have stuck their head in the sand and "forgot" about it. He manned up big time, kept the site going, and covered it all.

Western Union has said they are looking at Bitcoin. One if the coolest thing about Bitcoin isn't just what it can do, but how it can force others to change through unsquelchable competition.

If you have an HP printer it's saving everything you've ever printed and you probably have no way to disable that. There was a DEFCON (correct me someone?) talk where someone purchased lots of refurbished printers from various government agencies and other high-target organizations.

Im not sure I understand the connection everyone is making with Stallman and Bitcoin. **Stallman is openly a Statist** and he understands how control over the money supply empowers the State. He also wants to force people to pay their taxes and at times has hinted that Bitcoin "might be the answer" because it would ensure "everyone pays"
At the end of the day the guy believes that means justify an end. Want to make people free from burdens and restrictions of copying source code? Create a license with burdens and restrictions of how to copy source code. For freedom.

You are essentially just reducing the value of both goods for no reason. There is no utility gained by doing this. Let's take the example of a 3D printed pen that is a "physical bitcoin"
* It's impossible to actually intrinsically link the Pen and it's Bitcoin. It's just a Pen that has some Bitcoin writing on it. If the Bitcoin is spent, the Pen doesn't change and if the Pen is destroyed the Bitcoin in the network doesn't change.
* If I already have a Pen and a Bitcoin, what would I gain combining the two? If nothing, why would one combine the two? If it has no utility you're just wasting pens and BTC

@_date: 2013-03-24 03:38:13
This is going to yield fruitless results I believe. The reason (in my opinion) being that the definition of money contains the idea of independent use value. What is the unit of Bitcoin? Well, we call that a BTC or a Satoshi if you want to get that small.
What's a satoshi, and does it have independent use value? This is where the evaluation breaks down for me. You cannot separate the concept of a unit of Bitcoin and it's network. This leaves us with two basic outcomes to choose from:
* Bitcoin is money because it has use value, because the concept of a unit of it is the same as it's whole, and a decentralized communication system has value.
* Bitcoin is not "money" in a classical sense any more than bank account numbers are, although one could dispute the comparison because bank numbers no longer fulfill their use value if the banker goes bust.

The rest of your post is basically a plea to continue practicing wealth redistribution. I am not a rich person and most of my family is not rich. Hell, some of them collect government benefits. I'll also tell you that where I come from having these benefits is a horrible thing. In the town I grew up in most live on their tax income from having some kids, their food payed for with EBT, and their housing payed for by section 8 housing. I've also seen as these kids turn 16 and their mother, who has never worked a day in her life, tells her son to get a job. He looks at her utterly perplexed at what the hell she means. What he knows about a job is basically learned from movies and sleepovers with friends. That kid is an excellent worker now, but this system produces horrible horrible things.
Long story short, Bitcoin is financial freedom for reals not that phony subsidization ponzy scheme.

Value of bitcoin is because of utility it provides and scarcity.


A pyramid scheme is one that requires NEW members in order to continue to function.


This is not valid reasoning for why Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. There have been decentralized pyramid schemes, and even ones ran inside of Bitcoin (although they were transparent)
Your argument for  about criminal activity could be stronger if you point out that unlike cash Bitcoin can be tracked. Stolen coins are watched pretty closely, especially the more prestige they have.
For  don't say something unless you provide a source or backup the claim. Also the Bitcoin network difficulty can go down, so maybe if we all become digital crypto-friends in the future we won't have to spend as much work to get along.
For  I dont think you should present the idea that Bitcoin is highly liquid. The marketplace is expanding at an amazing rate, but sans services that let you exchange/convert/giftcards buying most things with BC is hard.

1. Blockchain.info is a secure wallet especailly when used via a browser extension.
2. It would be nice if things were priced in BTC, but that's nothing technical and purely based on adoption. As Bitcoin is shown to be a superior store of value it will gain adoption. Offering perks may speed that up, but Bitcoin has enough utility to easily gain adoption without it.
3. This is the fault of the traditional financial system, AML regulations, etc. Also if you transfer money from a bank account it can be "undone" so they have to insure against that.
4. Using the blockchain.info website this has never mattered to me. It keeps all my wallets together, I don't know about change addresses, and I can easily archive my old wallets and move funds into another one.

This assumes they understand they can't exploit the Bitcoin system directly for monetary gain. Considering their track records of exploting everything else my guess is they will try this too.


The exchange rates of that will probably do about as well as their fiat currencies long term as Bitcoin provides legitimate scarcity. If they can just press a button and print more then it's value will approach zero as time goes on.


Actually ALL things that happen in the Bitcoin network are done via merit and not decree, so government has literally zero role to play. Colored coins are the best bet government has at staying relative.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:42:50
I am going to try to answer as quick as possible for your benefit and mine (I am busy, sadly)


Currently we work with finite limits like 1MB. They are going to bump this up again to keep the network functioning, but the long term solution is to create an incentive that rewards valid blocks with no 'data bloat'. Regarding the actual size, that's something the growth of technology can handle (the size of the Internet is absurd)


They will just need a certain amount of the block chain. The way that the hashes work you can extend work on Bitcoin without having the entire history, and you can verify the entire history without having to keep it all the time.


There are two basic outcomes here. Either the technology problem disappears and somehow we get a block chain that is secure and fast, although it doesn't appear that will directly occur. Otherwise we will see a service architecture arise where wallet providers safegaurd consumers from the security risks. Probably a hybrid solution will arise that uses more service layers for more security.


In theory criminals could just pay each other in Bitcoin or buy mining hardware to avoid capital controls around the globe. The basic thing targeted by AML laws is someone doing this and then "cashing out" here in the US. As BTC becomes very liquidable  this concern is unrealistic.


They are actually "standard" transactions just there is no interface for making them in some wallet software. Bitcoin is actually a scripting language in the protocol and many payment schemes can be expressed in it. You are probably talking about M-of-N signature and the "lock" time.


Debt is a very large subject but Bitcoin at least has a finite money supply. This means that participating does not accumulate debt, something not the same for most fiat currencies.


Because of how chains of trust and distributed trust work. The reason Bitcoin works is because of Cryptography. We don't have to trust each other, because we trust crypto. However, that only gets us so far and if we want to go further we need another thing we can all trust. No such thing really exists, besides crypto, so we have to create a third party trust. There will probably (and should probably) never be a globally agreed upon third party of trust.
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:22:35
Confirmations are the number of blocks "deep" that transaction is in. The fewer confirmations, the higher the risk someone could be trying to trick someone. A general rule of thumb is each confirmation takes 10 minutes, and different services have different requirements for what they consider "ready to spend" - AKA a gambling website may be okay with only 3 confirmations whereas an exchange may require 10 or more.

I love Bitcoin and I am not scared by exploring this topic. People act like if it doesn't have a perfect answer to this question it can't work. That's not true at all.

Well, to be honest with you a lot of this information is fragmented or provided by sources that most new users are not aware of.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:29:24
Hmm, let's assume a 100 BTC transaction comes in and they take 1%, leaving a 1 BTC "profit" that the exchange earns.
* If there is no affiliate, the exchange pockets the entire 1 BTC profit
* There is an affiliate and they have no parent affiliate (or the parent is the exchange itself, which is the above case) then the exchange takes 0.8 BTC and pays the affiliate 0.2 BTC
* There is an affiliate and has parents. Start by splitting it into 0.8 BTC and 0.2 BTC like before. Now for the remaining 0.2 BTC chunk away 20% at a time as you walk up the affiliate chain. Assuming someone has 3 parent affiliates you would get something like:
    * 0.8 for the exchange
    * 0.0256 for the first affiliate parent
    * 0.032 for the second affiliate parent
    * 0.04 for the immediate parent affiliate
    * 0.1024 for the selling affiliate

As I've mentioned use blockchain.info when starting to avoid most of the complexity. Get a wallet address from there first:
Login and you will see your **public wallet address** which is something that is safe to give others and how you receive payments. It will begin with a 1 and say "This Is Your Bitcoin Address" above it. You can also click the "Receive Money" to see all your wallet addresses, you will probably only have one to start with. Copy the address for the account you want money in.
Now on reddit you want to withdraw your money from the bot. Remember, the bot is just another guy on reddit, and you can only do basic things with that bot like message it and see it's post/comments. To withrdaw you want to send a message to the "bitcointip" user like this:
Replace the "ThisIsYourWithdrawBitcoinAddress" with the address you copied from blockchain.info

Yes, any wallet you can find the **private key** for you can spend from. The easiest way would be to import that private key into the blockchain.info wallet and then transfer the BTC to your "main wallet" (which is probably also a blockchain.info wallet, but could be the Bitcoin-qt if you want)
While I may get some heat for this, I would recommend new users keep a small amount of money and get used to the idea via blockchain.info - Their interface is simple and most importantly:
* It gives you a great way to see everything you need and gets you used to the idea of working with wallets and transactions
* It supports multiple wallets quite well. You can archive old wallets, consolidate all into a single wallet, etc. without knowing much
* You aren't stuck to using their website, whenever you want you can move some or all of your BTC to another wallet, back your wallet up, or export it
* Their website is mostly secure (they don't have access to your wallet, since it's encrypted, you would have to log into a hacked website for that to happen)

I sell Bitcoin in person around town where I live and print out paper wallets that make this really easy. Basically I'm at the bar and someone and I are chatting about Bitcoin and they are interested. I have pieces of paper I printed from this website:
I usually keep about 4 of them with me, each loaded with 0.1 BTC. I print a small instructional booklet that covers part of the printed bill, which printed looks like this:
So basically someone wants to buy I show them the bill, but they cant take the money out of it because the "secret" part is covered by the instructions. They usually pull up Blockchain.info or install a Bitcoin app on their phone, or if they are going to do it on a computer we talk about how they will need to sign up with a wallet and import the money, which the instructions tell you how to do that.
They hand me the $20 or so dollars and I give them the bill. Then whenever they want or however they want they can import that money into their phone, web-wallet, or even Bitcoin running directly on their computer.
The problem is with Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws and the iron grip control in the monetary system. Selling and buying BTC on their own is absurdly easy. Doing it with banks and the government involved it becomes a complicated mess.
**NOTE** I make it clear to anyone buying that they should verify the contents, and sweep the paper wallet ASAP as someone could technically steal the money from the wallet if they don't unload it quickly.

Exchange websites work by storing your money in various units and then converting them. For example, let's say I wanted to get $1,000 of Bitcoin using BitFloor:
* I go to their website and create a deposit request. They give me a slip or ask for my checking account
* My money gets sent to them via deposit or bank transfer. The only thing keeping me safe at this moment is using a trusting exchange, they could just take my money and run!
* Assuming the exchange site is honest I should get USD credit in their site to use to create buy orders
Here is the important part: **get your money out of the exchange as fast as possible**
Once you create a buy order and get your BTC into your own wallet, it cannot be stolen even if the website is hacked. However, if you keep your money in the website and only issue buy orders when you want to liquidate your money, it can all go *poof* if they get hacked.

Currently holding a bet the market will shift down at $25, but it's all guess work. Some legitimate expansion since $18, but a lot of us think $25 and onward is bubble-zone. The current bet has a linear relationship with my price point at $25 and his at $30. So if the price peaks at $27.50 neither pay each other, but if it peaks at $30 he gets 100% of the bet and if it peaks at $25 I get 100% of the bet.
If the market does anything outside of the $25 - $30 zone neither of us win the bet. The bet is only for $1 though, so it's just a gentleman's bet.
**TL;DR** Sell above $25

Only if the amount of transactions accepted in a block increases, which is currently limited by the maximum block size. If there are 5 million transactions waiting to be confirmed, they all can't fit in a single block. Currently a user would have to pay a very high transaction fee to compete with the subsidy + others to get their transaction included in a timely manner in that situation.
As the block subsidy decreases the artificial lower bound on transaction fees does as well, and it becomes a free market exchange. This is pretty much identical to minimum wage, it's not an end-all but it has serious drawbacks.

Everyone here is really concerned about things that I am not. I don't fear government, as I understand their attempts to thwart Bitcoin simply amplify it. **My fear comes from within the Bitcoin community**
Right now there are a few things:
* Folks in the Bitcoin community that are actively trying to discredit it. I'm sure you've seen them on this forum and in others. There are people that register accounts just to talk trash, invent stories of being scammed and even some that create fake websites to perpetuate this
* Attempts to compromise with existing financial institutions. There are a few groups, some with lots of primary developers, that have vague goals to help Bitcoin "fit in" - This is worrying because at some point you may see a protocol/development splinter because some are okay with making changes and working with government while others are not.
Let's imagine tomorrow that the Bitcoin Foundatoin was approached by the government of a large country, like the United States, and the basic premise of the deal was that they would declare Bitcoin legal and okay for business use if they make a few small changes to the protocol - say for tracking taxation or who knows what.
Both outcomes are pretty crappy. Either we get the outside forces like the US changing the protocol, or we get splintered development. Obviously the latter of the two is workable whereas the former is not.

That is kind of one of my fears...


Satoshi could have sold away Bitcoins instead of included them as subsidy in the new blocks of the blockchain, and if he had Bitcoin would probably have grown at an abysmal rate.
The chain should be seeded in such a way where people actually doing the work or helping promote the usage of the system benefit - like a meritocracy. With the original Bitcoin folks who fired up their system and helped the peer-to-peer network were rewarded with the subsidy and it created a relationship between the merit of the work and the seeding of initial capital.

Your threat model of having XSS injected script code makes it impossible for either hashed or plain-text password to be safe from an attacker. It has nothing to do with computing a hash. Compare to your operating system password hashing. With physical access you can get access to the machine running without the original password via hash insertion, essentially the same as your javascript example by replacing the hash. However, you wouldn't have access to my encrypted volume drives because the original password used to encrypt those would still be unknown.

The problem is:

* They value (some of) your property and include it in that as part of the amount you are travelling with. Also, how they value goods is "interesting". I am not from Brazil, but for example I hear a car costs a lot more there. Brazil may say something is worth much more than it was in the US.

Storing your money anywhere unsafe is an invititation to theft and fraud. Some online services and their method of use are safe, and some are not. The world is not as simple as you espouse.


This happened weeks ago. Did they just now release the information, because the guy who found this posted here on long ago, after waiting for a while for them to fix it before disclosure.
You can safely use online wallets. I find it really funny that people are taken in by the bravado effect and assume their security is bulletproof. You have two options, manage your security yourself or outsource it to someone else. You can do both too. I keep a blockchain.info wallet for fast/small transfers and a cold storage wallet for long term storage.

In the 2 year view of things yes, but in terms of this rally no. This rally will not go straight to $50 or anything like that. I would obviously welcome eating my words here, but in any event we're going to see a similar trend to other markets with a slow-and-easy shift into the market. Not many sane people with kids, etc. are willing to instantly throw all their wealth into Bitcoin until they see it holding water.

He doesn't really have to make his point with such a basic principle and it's not his job to educate you (and the many other downvoters) that do not know basic economics. Granted you don't need to know them to enjoy Bitcoin, but if you are going to downvote someone talking about a bubble and you don't know what a bubble is... then you are ignorant.
His argument is that Bitcoin price is increasing not due to legitimate business activity, but due to speculative trading or "oscillatory hunting" - people that had money and can use it to manipulate the appearance of trade outcomes.
Most agree the Bitcoin market is doing a lot of awesome things, but there is a shelling point where we start to back off and become hesitent that the market is legitimately investing. In this case, there are new businesses (BitcoinStore) and lots of folks turning to BTC for gambling - but that only gets us so far.
TL;DR - Some market increase is legitimate, some is not. Nobody knows the true outcome this is a shelling point.

This is an appeal to authority and doesn't address any of my claims.


I never disputed an XSS or client-side attack. I even went as far to say in my reply


My point is addressing the login passwords and my claim is they don't have to be exchanged in a way that other websites are comprimised. I don't dispute if you have client-side access via XSS or physical access to the machine that you can record the password being entered.
I would prefer the HTML spec to properly address this so that I can know my browser is never sending the plain-text password but always a properly hashed password with something like PBKDF2. This never made it out of WHATG committee.


Again I would prefer this is part of the HTML spec as a supplement to `input type="password"` which you could trust.


And he can't modify your browser. He can steal your hash, but as I mentioned websites B and C would be unaffected. Assuming this was implemented UAC style it would be very clear where and when you are submitting a password securely.

I care about how my browser can authorize payments and the mechanisms used to do this. I care when local storage was added because it could be used to store malicious things in my browser. I also care when Javascript and cross-domain policies are made so that I can trust one website is not allowed to authenticate as another.


Pretty far. It's obviously more than the URI scheme already used to make it so when you press a button the external app can process the transaction. Likely there will be some kind of bridge between the browser and payment app/API.


And some might be manipulated into doing bad things, possibly while following the spec. HTML5 and WebGL are some examples of specs that were dangerous to follow at times.


Not hard to imagine at all. The original specs for HTML4, CSS1, CSS2, and such were pretty simple. The devil is in the details.
I'm not against the idea of doing it, I'm just making it perfectly clear the track record of both the WC3 setting standards and other people following them is bad.

I see your point now. Not sure what all that Occupy bullshit was but your basic claim is that Bitcoin shouldn't bend to the will of the government.
Bitcoin is a protocol. Anyone is free to make changes to it, but getting those changes adopted is another story. If the official client ever gets a protocol change to add tax IDs or some shit everyone will just simply not run that protocol and continue with the version before it, probably killing whatever project tried to do that - even the reference client if need be.

* Buy drugs online with less physical risk. I'm still friends with my grower, so it's of little interest to me, but for people in areas where buying these types of goods is dangerous this kind of option is a game changer. Also on the flip side someone selling drugs is safer and at less risk as well.
* Buy things online from people I don't fully trust (people that might steal my card) Places like online BitTorrent sites and other communities can now be funded because members have less risk supporting them.
* Micro-finance people in third world countries (send 0.001 a 100000 times) Most modern setups unless crafted specially would absorb too much cost. Even with a "smart" plan you would need agencies in various countries to pool the donations - all at a cost. Bitcoin just does it.
* One-stop-gambling sites like SatoshiDice (most people cannot gamble so easily and instead have to travel and regulated online gambling is a mess)

They are subject to the same problems, but they don't have to handle it the same way. It would have been very easy for the to convert the $150 that they received into BTC, set it off to the side, check the fraud (which is their burden / risk to manage), then payout adjusted.
If that cannot work then doing ACH cannot work, because it's taking you more time/energy to validate the fraud costing your customers more than the service is worth.

It has flaws but it's not broken. I'm quite confident the transaction prices would be stable if the block subsidy was cut off. There would be temporary volatility as we corrected the malinvestments from the past subsidy, but it would stabilize.

You may have some luck running a `bitcoind` and scanning the block chain with it. You should try in testnet first so you don't have to wait.
Basically you can run `getblockcount` and create a loop that polls waiting for a new block. Then use `getblockhash` to get the hash and then `getblock` to get the block itself. This has the `tx` array in the response.
Now you can use `getrawtransaction` and then `decoderawtransaction` to read these. You should get something like this:
	string(216) "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0d03c4d1000162062f503253482fffffffff0100f2052a01000000232103bcdbae45f1f886ec93b46dd41b732af056043d3a9b26056178855c5f7cf44dadac00000000"
	object(stdClass) (5) {

Bitcoin for the mid-twenties me is a lot like programming and the early teen me. When I was younger I didn't care about math, physics, etc. because everyone at school who talked about those things or did them was picked on or outcast. One day while playing my SNES and wishing I could make games, an older friend of the family told me "Well, you could learn to program and make a game, but you'd have to learn some math"
A cost benefit analysis was created in my dull little mind. On the one hand, how much do I care about what people at school say or do versus how much do I want to make my own game or "risk" learning math?
I decided to start trying to make my own game, and it was a whirlwind of learning programming and mathematics at a rudimentary level. Sure I had passed my math classes, but I didn't give a shit and it all leaked out my brain. When I was coding I would see the reason I cared and I couldn't forget. How do I bounce the pong ball? Negate it's velocity along the axis. How do I translate it's velocity into an angle of orientation? Need to learn some trig and use arc/tangents. Eventually, how do I integrate the verlet simulation with minimal error? 
Bitcoin is almost identical except instead of learning programming and math for making games, I am learning about monetary theory and economics in a way that matters for me.
Also interesting is you'll go back to school or mesh with some folks that did it the "other way" later and it will be very entertaining to talk with them. You'll see your old self learning things in a very myopic way, not using the skill and basically just moving from one class to another until they get their piece of paper.

People can care about their country and refuse to pay taxes. It's happened many times in history (we're kind of an example of that)


I'm just trying to identify the principles being used. Obviously I can't demand money and start hitting others over the head if I don't get my way, but the State can.


Okay, so tomorrow a law gets passed by 50% of the voting public that is written to say:
* Anyone named `bighandxyz` pays 100% income tax rate and has to shine the shoes of `KayRice`
I assume that would be wrong, but if the State made the rule, would it be right? Would you pay the tax? If this is too hypothetical I can give a better example although it would be more complex but still involve the same question of principles.

This is not why their system doesn't work. It's not a hardware / optimization scaling problem. They have a machine learning algorithm that tells them if a trade is likely fraudulent or not, and they have to be very careful in their training of that. They are likely extremely resistant to do anything outside the model that the learning algorithm knows because it will skew it's understanding of the system.
Over time they hope this algorithm to get better. I personally think it will fall down at some point and they will be forced to use more human power, or diversify their offerings into tiers.

Yes I have a great job and make decent money. I don't make anything close to minimum wage if that's what were getting at here. I work a lower-teir software engineering job.


No they just cut a check from the bank across the street. I can either go there and they deduct $5 to cash it or have it cashed at Wal-Mart and waive the fee if I put some on the card.


Just the Wal-Mart money card thing. I think it has some $500 or $1000 limit.


Before Wal-Mart I had a PayPal card and all my bank accounts fed into that. There was no real way to keep using PayPal when I cancelled my bank accounts so I haven't touched it in years.


Using my Wal-Mart card or Bitcoin. I actually could use Bitcoin a lot more but I am trying to save it long term.


I pay my rent in money order which is actually how my landlord wants it. I offered to setup direct deposit (because I can have my work deposit for her) but she insists that this is actually her preferred method of taking payment. The post office is right outside my house so I pay them $1.50 to issue a money order for about a grand.


I go to H&amp;R Block and they take cash for my tax payments. I have also gone to the capitol building and payed my taxes in cash because it's required by law.

* Do **whatever you want** - Is really the key. Most of my fun with Bitcoin stems from the fact that nobody is playing middle man, and if someone wants to do something they can. I see websites all the time and say to myself "This would never have got made if they took credit cards" - and it's true!
* At worst an awesome **sandbox for understanding economic activity**
* At best **a financial revolution**
* Enables a **micro-payment** or **micro-lending** economy not possible before. My best way of pitching this is to ask someone to imagine waking up every day and giving $0.01 to a kid in the world with a great idea instead of playing the lottery. Right now that is not realistic because the cost to send $0.01 is too high via the traditional methods.
* Simple and **low-risk gambling** websites that have great payout records and open book-keeping. I have an account on blockchain.info that I keep just to play SatoshiDice on, so I can track all my gambling to avoid getting "too deep" - I started with $30 and I'm up to $80 - with some fun in between. Even if I lost all $30 I've had a fun time playing the odds.
* Start **sharing with others in ways you never thought possible**. Bitcoin tears down walls, and all of the sudden you've opened your eyes to buying some candy from the Swiss, or having that widget fabricated in China, or getting those guys to sing that song for a girl you like. It's really amazing to see what people do when the elephant has been kicked out of the room.

This is the problem here is the terms. When you say "free software" if you're talking about the GPL, then I disagree with the term. Just like copyright places restrictions on who can see what and under what conditions, the GPL does as well.
For people to experience software freedoms you need to be able to copy code. Most people who back the GPL up probably have never read the entire thing, whereas most people who support BSD-like licenses probably read that little 3 clause at one point!

With strings attached I am sure. I'm almost 100% certain you didn't get an allodial title, so that car is not exclusively your property. It can be towed, stolen by the state, etc. and you have to follow all their existing rules and any new rules they make to keep that car.


Because the government has Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws that drastically complicate what Bitcoin can do very well. If you look at the history of exchange services, they were better in the past before AML crackdowns came. However, those AML laws were NOT made because of Bitcoin.


You can perform Bitcoin transactions, just not checking (ACH) and other traditional banking transfers - because of AML restrictions by the government. If you sign up with blockchain.info and get a wallet and did some web work to get paid you would instantly get the coin and could instantly send it to anyone else with no restrictions. This is the traditional banking system at fault, not Bitcoin. Most of this comes from the fact that non-Bitcoin transactions are typically reversable, whereas Bitcoin transactions are not.


These are likely scam / spam sites attempting to capitalize on this confusion of a new thing like Bitcoin.


We love it and we hate it. Firstly, most of us can think back about a year and most of this shit was not happening. BitFloor and BitInstant were really awesome. I would walk into a Wels Fargo, give them cash and I would get Bitcoin the same hour. When the AML crackdown came things changed and these sites started requiring ID and then eventually shut down or got so back-logged they can't process orders anymore.
Also, from the perspective of a Bitcoin holder the lack of liquidity in the short term drives the price up. So it being harder to buy Bitcoin is a good thing for people selling it right now.
It's just like any other form of regulated trade or black market. The cost of drugs is increased by the risk of being caught / having to evade the law. If the restrictions continue to make Bitcoin hard to obtain it will continue to drive the price of it up as long as Bitcoin maintains it's long term store of value, which is expected / mathematically ensured.


Bitcoin is a global thing. These problems are somewhat unique the United States. Your best bet is probably to find others with coin and trade. I, for one, don't make any of my coin transactions via bank because I suspect one day the authorities will make a move.

Nobody has expectations in the US like that. It involves too many moving parts and each time you point one part out "you're crazy to think that" - So the Fed and our money system is perfect, but we have a broken economy, and we have to regulate things, because without regulation they would be more broken than they already are.

I may be taking a look at this for my own interests. While I agree with the basic analysis that the private key missing 26 characters makes it unlikely to brute-force crack it, we have more information than that:
* Partial QR code (may be of little value)
* Partial public address
I believe that having part of that public address drastically reduces the search space for the private key, since you know some of that as well.

People who hate on Blockchain.info don't understand how it works. It protects against  most/all attack types that are currently known:
* All encryption / decryption takes place in your browser, not on their server or over the wire in clear text
* Their website does not have decrypted copies saved that can be used to spend your funds
* You can save a copy of the HTML or install a browser plugin to stop new code from being automatically ran (thus stopping the server, if hacked, from getting your original password)
Most of the complaints I have seen do not have an attack vector/surface and simply boil down to "computers have been hacked before" and therefor all computers are hackable. Theory aside (yes anything man made is man hackable) this is the digital equivalent of "One day you're going to die"

Your response to my comment was a URL, so I responded with an equally brief statement. I do think we've exhausted the usefulness of this conversation. You're not going to convince me of Keynesianism and CPI anymore than I am going to convince you of sound money or Austrian Business Theory.


I never said anything about exchanging $10, 10 oz of gold, or the currency of Zimbabwe.  I asked you which one you want, because each have different levels of scarcity. Zimbabwe holds nothing scarce and prints trillion dollar bills and is worthless. 


Your minimizing your argument now. You don't seem to have a principle about how inflation is affected by supply. This is a common disagreement between these two schools of thought and likely not something we will agree on.


Nice attempt at a false dichotomy, please see my previous response about inflation.


Again, this is a false dichotomy. I never claimed anything can be immune from changes in supply and thus have zero inflation. My point is that inflation decreases purchasing power, which is demonstrably true.


We come from different schools of thought. You appear to also know a lot more than Robert Murphy or Ludwig Von Mises by that measuring stick.


Which is interesting considering all current accepted forms of fiat are backed by a bank with lots of gold reserves. Also, I like your "No True Scottsman" attitude with economic profession.
Thanks for the conversation, and I look forward to your response, but I won't be participating anymore. You are combative and don't back up your claims, but instead add new ones, which is an endless game.

I use re-loadable cards to pay for things online. I actually did this before I closed my bank accounts anyhow because of how popular automatic billing was getting.

Local bills I make payment in person or use a bill-pay service like Wal-Mart or V-Pay. I basically walk up to a machine and they add $3 to the bill for processing.

Wallet and transaction addresses are stored in a large ledger called the block chain. That's all that is important. The authentication mechanism for ensuring nobody can break that ledger or insert crap into it is the **proof-of-work** system - which happens to be based off SHA256 in Bitcoin - which also doesn't really matter. What matters is adjustments to the ledger are done within constraints and idiots can't make endless adjustments without wasting their own money.


While the inventor is obviously a very smart person, the basic framework for Bitcoin and how it emerged can be seen. One could make a very ghetto Bitcoin using BitTorrent and `.txt` files, but it would require publishing more `.torrent` files (SHA1 hashes) and what system would you use to keep all that in place? Bitcoin is basically such a system that makes it easy to share this big file that always changes.


You can print the private key on a piece of paper and know that anyone who has that piece of paper can effectively spend those coins, but actually doing all of the mathematics by hand would be absurd. The point of a paper wallet is to print the private key onto a medium that is completely free from computer/network attacks.

You don't "encrypt" passwords to send them, you hash them degrading the value of the original password with respect to the CPU time and collision space to recover it - using very similar cryptographic hashing functions as Bitcoin itself (SHA-256)


That's not what his screenshot is about. Nobody is disputing that your password is on your local client side in memory. His screenshot clearly shows the **Network** tab being selected and the fact that the **HTTP POST** has his original password not hashed.


SSL does not do the job because a MITM obviously can get the plain text password. At the end of the day the other site gets the **original password** whereas with hashing **they never get the original password at all and have no way to get the original plain-text password back** (assuming they use a strong hashing scheme)


That view doesn't really hold that well with Bitcoin friendly folks. That StackOverflow user is essentially saying that proof-of-working systems, like Bitcoin using the SHA-256 function, are a waste of resources. I think as DDoS attacks are getting more common and MITM attacks are getting easier from governments to common criminals there is a very strong case to be made that you need to digitally prove yourself.


This is a red-herring. My argument is that I do not want the plain-text password to be recoverable from the target web server or MITM attack. The argument that increasing the technical security parameters will make users more "relaxed" overlooks the fact that people already have horrible password habits. Many people use the same password for many sites. You probably do. I know I do for some. If website A steals your password, such as by getting hacked and making poor choices on their web-server to not store hashed passwords, then you must go change the password for website B and C - assuming you know about this in time. If you don't the attacker can go and access site B and C. With a properly implemented hashing scheme the original server never had the plain-text password so B and C are only exposed relative to the amount of CPU time required to break the password and the amount of tolerance B and C have for failed logins. Remember if you're breaking passwords from hashes you have to deal with collision rate. You may get thousands to millions of other potential password matches, and if you use something very obscure the password cracking algorithm may skip over your collision. Assume website B and C only allow 5 failed login attempts with an exponential fall-off and it drastically improves this whole password stealing wild west we are in.

A few quick points for anyone in a panic:
* This is talking about someone who exported and imported their wallet during the block chain split last night
* The sender manually sent his payment using two different systems during the time when the split had occurred
* No money was lost and no double spend has been permanently accepted into any blockchain. **There are not two transactions in the same blockchain with the same input**
* He used the raw RPC to do this to avoid certain warnings, checks and alerts that would be given to stop you from doing this
This is how decentralized systems work. When a problem happens and there is not a unanimous choice, there will be a problem as we converge to one. In this case there are some temporary issues during the time when a major disagreement (bug) occurred. Honestly guys, we did really well.

Most people once they see that you are committed to something and have little to gain from them trying it will begin to check things out. Also it helps that at the end of the day I am okay with people not using Bitcoin, because eventually VISA and crew will be a layer above Bitcoin anyway.
Once they see that kind of reasoning they get interested.

If you're looking to learn more without getting confused by computer science terms like *hashing functions* try some practical examples. Here is a website that lets you generate Bitcoin addresses in your browser:
If you go to "Bulk Wallet" you can generate X addresses at once. The more you generate, the longer it will take. This is in your browser so it's slower than other tools, but the general concept is the same: the more you try the longer it takes.
Here is an example of a generated address:
    2,"1YYELrVm6Whm5UgdM5JvLPeRTeKxbAwdi","5JztuRwU7K8VKhycbAFUTQ6rRneH6p7ZvgJF1VJKXQdjwpw17iz"
That's the number (since you requested X amount, this is the second one), followed by the public key, and lastly the private key.
( NOTE: Don't do anything with these keys! Someone could steal your coins if you import them and move money or receive change to that address)
If you change any of the letters of the public or private key you will notice it will no longer import / is not a valid keypair. This is because the public and private key are required to meet a mathematical relationship.
To simplify things, imagine the public keys are letters and private keys are numbers. For example "A" and "1" - and the relationship they must follow that "B" must be "2" and "C" must be "3" etc. Given the key pair "A" and "1" if you just change "1" to be "5" you get the keypair "A" and "5", which is not valid.
Now the game because, how can I find valid keypairs without trying invalid keypairs?

I have tried about 5 times to get the various standards groups to implement this for about 4 years now. This fuckwad at Google each time can't understand the threat model and stops the process dead in it's tracks saying "SSL does that for us" - Yeah it doesn't mother fucker it doesn't because plain text passwords still go over the protocol you stupid piece of shit.
Fuck you WHATG and Ian at Google.
**EDIT** What OP is saying is spot on and if standards bodies could pull their head out of their ass and implement this at the HTML form level we would never have this problem again.

His main point seems to be that government has something to offer to Bitcoin, but what would that be? Every time someone tries to latch government on to Bitcoin they usually begin spelling out a private company doing something through voluntary market interaction and NOT a government entity backed by mandate.

This is well known as one of the primary reasons the OLPC failed. Being from Oregon I know a few people that worked on the project at OSU's OSL. The tech and concept of that idea was brilliant and achieved (minus a few minor speed bumps) but all of their success was wasted as this "distribution" model sucked the life out of their project as units didn't move and other technology moved forward.
Also, anyone wanting to buy a OLPC probably remembers how absurd this purchasing practice is. The pricing is confusing, and at the end the biggest thing you're selling (a laptop at a fixed low cost) is tarnished.

Not sure I understand. The idea of how to do it and the technical implementation are not the issue. The problems are entirely with AML and other regulations.
