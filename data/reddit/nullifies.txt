Decent C++ experience.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:56:52
I have it is a lot to take in though.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:16:47
Oh awesome I had seen it online, good to know its good.

He looks like someone that bought a lot of bitcoin a few months ago.

That's kind of what I'm doing but using the API. It seems like the main issue is with connecting them. When I log the transactions that were sent only the main node's are being picked up.

I think you misinterpreted the question or I asked the wrong question. Who is running these private blockchains? Like are the private organizations running large computers that are doing the work of the thousands of computers on the Bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:23:55
I can't tell if you're joking. Is there an API that I'm missing?
@_date: 2016-09-12 20:48:38
Oh, ok so basically nodes still have to be run in a private chain however, the security of a large proof of work chain isn't possible so the chain is made so only certain people will be able to access it. So people who run a node for the private chain in turn get the ability to verify for the blockchain.

Yeah, my nodes are all running Ubuntu Server 16.04.
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:23:03
Oh I am, I forgot to put that in the post. Will do that now.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:06:48
Yeah that's what we are doing however I was wondering if there was a better interface to use for interacting with regtest, that seems to be the majority of the issue I am having, especially when it comes to clearing the mempool in between tests. I have to kind of kill the daemon on each node, delete the mempool.dat then restart each daemon and it's really hard time ensure the processes goes smoothly.

Do you know where I could learn more about the technical side of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:44:24
Oh ok then the network accepts or denies that transaction based on its contents?
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:46:11
That makes a lot more sense
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:37:03
Well i mean, How do you verify that the underlying code hasn't been modified?
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:54:05
So basically, your client files are hashed an if they don't match verified signatures provided by core, the network rejects it?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:18:02
I was afraid that would be the case. I'll just hold it for a while and see what happens with SegWit/UASF (I actually have no idea what those are, I haven't really been active in the scalability debate).
