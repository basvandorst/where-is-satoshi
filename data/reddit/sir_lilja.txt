Yeah, duh. Women are half the population. So how about just saying "we, as people, will play a very large part..."

Yeah, holy shit. It feels huge. I've bought 95% of all my games from Webhallen the last 10 years.

So you don't want things like far lower transaction fees, fast international transfer with no higher fees than regular, transparency, a financial system outside of state control etc. There are more points, I'm really not the most educated person on bitcoin. But the benefits are quite obvious to me.

The link at the bottom of this article, from one month ago, claims 76% of Americans haven't heard of bitcoin. Though I wouldn't believe either of these numbers at all.

It doesn't matter how you word it. You posted your address, and you're begging.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:17:07


That's a bit sad. If it comes to a point where you won't notice the difference yourself, but it has huge benefits for others (say small shop owners in developing economies), wouldn't you want to adopt it then? For the good of the less fortunate?
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:09:08
He didn't even imply that.

Isn't the time on the TV supposed to be accurate? Is the clock under your TV just 13 minutes ahead?

The question here is how deep of an understanding he has of Bitcoin and its network. He might just be focusing on the currecy part. The article is too short. We don't really get to know his reasoning.

I'm up about 105% from my ASIC purchase. Feels good man.

Cash. So it's a bit lower in BTC value. But not by much actually.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:38:37


That's what's changing in the near future. It will become just as easy. Debit card-like transactions, along with the benefits of bitcoin.

Do you really? You may get your cut more often, but it's smaller. You should get about the same amount over time from any pool if your hash rate is the same.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:00:30
Yeah. But in this case they specifically said "bitcoin mining".
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:25:57
It's safer. Combine it with a webcam to scan QR codes to verify transactions and it'll never have to have contact with a computer or USB thingy that has touched the internet, except maybe when you first set it up.

You have the added advantage of the vegetables, but some of it has added sugar. The bread has been shown to have a high sodium content and a fair amount of sugar.
I still think you're right though. I don't have the patience to find out more.
@_date: 2013-10-08 08:15:11
Is this true? Are there some sort of numbers available on this?
If so then... wow, just wow.
@_date: 2013-09-30 15:10:36


Faster I believe. They have everything, all the parts. [Images here]( show them assembling units in their chassis, and they've said they would be able to ship very fast after production has been done. They are also testing hashing right now according to people.
I bet they start shipping tomorrow.

Well he says this:


Then goes on to say how it makes sending money overseas easy. And no, it's not completely useless for everyday use. A few stores are accepting bitcoins and the number is slowly rising, getting faster with time.

Can anyone provide a summary of the differences betweeen e-gold and BTC? It feels like this man is just grumpy he failed.

They mentioned the steps money has taken. From trading commodities, to commodity money, to fiat. Nowadays most our fiat is in purely digital form. So the next step to a solely digital currency shouldn't be too unthinkable, surely? Myself I've used cash on less than five occasions the last couple of years. They're more of a nuisance when I can use my debit card everywhere.
But I agree with the caution and that we should try to learn as much from this as possible, whichever outcome.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:39:47
It's safer because it is a separate computer you have that is never online. A thumbdrive you plug in to a computer with access to the internet is potentially infectable. You have to plug the thumbdrive in to an online computer to verify transactions/boot right? Raspberry with webcam does not have to do that. You could also use a cheap laptop in the same way as the Raspberry. Or android device.

Just taking precautions.
The first one was kind of implied though, I'd argue.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:05:55
Was it stolen though? Maybe they had a reason to switch escrow addresses or whatever. We should wait for info before assuming things.
EDIT: Oh. I just read this:

It's supposed to fit in your wallet. And there's an alarm function.

No. How come? How else am I to interpret "Now go pay attention to your wife, she needs you more.".
I mean, doesn't that kind of mean the commenter thinks OP is not paying enough attention to his wife? Why else would he say it? Seems rude to me. Yes, she needs you more than some screens and however many bitcoins OP owns, but isn't that obvious? Does OP need to hear this comment whenever he posts something about his hobby?

Even if you boot from the drive with no network functionality there are threats that can access the components in your computer, thus gaining access to the internet, or planting a threat on your hard drive to later send your private keys when you go online.
Tinfoil hat warning. But there really exists sophisticated viruses like that.
