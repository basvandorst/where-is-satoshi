I see this is a fundamental shifting of the goalposts. The factors that fuelled the rise in the value of Bitcoin came from its utility as a currency. Now that its utility as a currency largely disappeared, new arguments are put forward as to why Bitcoin justifies its current price and speculating further. If it's now understood to be a store of value i.e an illiquid commodity with artificial scarcity, do you think this is beneficial for hoarders who wish to see the price rise? I don't .. because it's abandoning the fundamentals that gave Bitcoin its brand image, a decentralised P2P currency. I believe we will soon have an "Emperor has no clothes" moment. 
It's a few vested interests that are keeping the price of BTC high .. people that own it. That's rational and understandable .. but market pressure will soon become unbearable. New entrants to the crypto game, of which there are a huge potential pool (think global), have interests in getting in on the ground floor of a rival crypto, and crashing Bitcoin .. and the weakness for Bitcoin is, the barrier to entry is pretty low. Anyone can start a Bitcoin .. the hard part is gaining trust and widespread adoption. Early Bitcoin evangelists did the foot work when they got Bitcoin accepted as a currency in a few places, which let's be honest served as a shield for the majority of its usage - drug transactions. Rambling here but I hope I made some sense to you.

Can anyone here tell me the exchange that demands the least private info from me?

I can understand that was always a kind of side-benefit of Bitcoin .. however think about it logically. You are putting forward the argument that BTC is essentially like digital gold, and it's utility has recently shifted from being a currency, to being a rare commodity. I can see that logic, but I can see many holes in it. 
Tell me why you have such high confidence a new BTC will not come along and usurp Bitcoin's place as King? Imagine I invent a machine that creates a new Gold-like element, similar weight, similar lustre, similar weight .. Gold price will surely fall. Alchemists have tried and failed to achieve this, but crypto is different. The protocol is can always be improved upon. It feels like we're in the 1990s internet dotcom boom and you're investing heavily in AOL and Yahoo because of their huge market dominance .. but around the same time, Google was quietly doing its thing and producing a technically superior product, and now Google is up there. In 20 years, some new Google which is barely heard of now might take its place. Maybe Urbit or some other decentralised system?
If you have faith in the protocol, and you plan to hold forever, that's up to you, or do you have a price in mind that you will sell all or half? I actually hold a bunch of cryptos Bitcoin included, but i'm not obsessive nor do I wish to shill it or any other crypto online or anywhere else. It's a private thing for me.

You didn’t address my point I’m afraid. What’s to stop people using a new version of Bitcoin, thereby eliminating or extending the 21 million coins problem? As long as the code is as solid as bitcoin, there’s no reason people wouldn’t begin to trust the new Bitcoin over the older one, and actually use it as a currency too. 
The scarcity concept of Bitcoin is easily surmountable. now can you tell me why I’m wrong? I’m looking a year ahead and finding fewer and fewer intrinsic reasons BTC will remain No.1.. what I am seeing is vested interests who hold BTC impeding the spread of new cryptos which would threaten the value of BTC. Remember 1000 people own 40% of the BTC, it’s in their interests to keep BTC as the dominant crypto, no matter how crippled and unwieldy it becomes.

It’s hard to understand why people are still speculating with Bitcoin. The market isn’t acting rationally. People are paying higher prices for lower utility, because of its scarcity? For expected future gains.. well, all it would take to crash bitcoin would be for second coin adoption to reach a critical mass. This will also damage trust in crypto, because the scarcity argument will be seen for the fraud that it is, since anyone can clone the protocol. Once everyone understands the concept of crypto scarcity cannot be replicated like Gold can, price will settle down. 
Bitcoin works if it’s the only crypto .. and it has a headstart and has brand name recognition. That’s what it is coasting on imo.

How is the price going up a certainty? I was thinking about this, basically the btc is designed to artificially promote scarcity with the 21 million coins.. but if you fork it, suddenly the scarcity problem goes away. 
I’m wondering what fundamentals you are basing your prediction on

Was there a raft of competing crypto currencies at $10? Did Bitcoins huge scaling problems become apparent at that time? Did Bitcoin have 15 or 20% tx fees at $10?
The 21M limit is not valid, because all it would take to render it useless would be to release a technically superior crypto. Now the hard part would be getting the masses to trust my crypto over Bitcoin, but that will come with time and usage. I can see a big e-store or Steam accepting CryptoX in the near future. I can’t see the store accepting btc due to the price volatility and long confirmation times and fees. It’s a victim of its own success in a way.

I’m still struggling to see where the intrinsic value comes from. Bitcoin will soon be superseded by technically superior coins with better privacy, lower fees, more stable values, faster transactions. When that happens, what is the force that is stopping Bitcoin falling in price and the superior coin taking its place? As far as I can see, it’s the centralised institutions that want to keep the price high. Exchanges, mining pools, early investors, holders, drug market operators. 
I understand the utility of crypto, I just don’t see how anyone can be so confident bitcoin will stay number 1. The invisible forces keeping Bitcoin at the top will not be able to buck the free market forever. This transition from currency to store of value or asset/commodity was not intended to happen, but was rather a byproduct of its inability to scale. But it was the currency component that fuelled all the initial growth. Bitcoin must return to those fundamentals if it is to have a viable future.

If this is true, i'm *amazed* it's taken 5 years to identify him. I mean, he was born Satoshi Nakatomo. How many babies with names of Satoshi Nakatomo are on birth certificates in the US? Furthermore how many have backgrounds in tech? Can't be more than 10 at the most.

i've lurked this sub for a year now, but i'm getting really tired of these bullshit editorialised overhyped titles and submissions. it's getting boring. oh what I would give for some proper curation, and not just content pushed to the top by people who are reading what they want to read.

What happened to the BTC? was it seized, or did he email it to friends to use while he was inside. I'm also pretty interested in how they got caught.
