1. Maybe not, as hardware wallets are around 65 (usd)  So a hardware wallet would be a little more than a quarter of your total investment
2. The nano ledger holds many coins!  i even hold my neo on my nano ledger. 
3. From my understanding, the private key is physically in the device itself.  A hacker would need both your pin code and your hardware wallet.
4.there are still fees on the nano ledger, but you can choose if you want a higher or lower fee for the cost of transaction speed.

1. Get yourself a hardware wallet, like the nano ledger s or the Trezor.  I have a nano ledger s and I love it, it can hold numerous coins such as BTC, ETH, and LTC.
2. You will have to first buy the BTC; rather it be wire transferring from your bank to an exchange, or maybe physically buying off someone from a third party site like localbitcoins.  The nano ledger s can hold many different alt coins, I recommend looking up what coins can be held by hardware wallets.
3.  I don't know about mobile phone wallets, but I can point out a few pros in having your coins on a hardware wallet as opposed to an exchange.  When i kept coins on an exchange, I was constantly looking for a window to buy/sell.  Now that I store my coins on my nano, it kinda forces me to hodl and provides peace of mind.  
Another pro for keeping coins on a hardware wallet is flexibility, you can send your btc to bittrex if bitfinex is down, or vice versa.
4. Avoiding fees? lol, welcome to the game.
