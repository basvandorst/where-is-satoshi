Are these numbers from your account history page? Or just the immediate receipt that pops go after submitting the transaction?

This is the right answer and how I conduct myself towards colleagues and friends as well! Great answer.

I wonder who owns enough bitcoin to seriously affect the price of bitcoin long term. Bitcoins market cap is currently $270 trillion. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:10
You mean like the entire alt coin market?

Staring at charts all day is good when learning but it can become a sick addicting habit causing you to rethink your investment and attempt to swing trade. You won’t win swing trading (more often than not). 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:05:47
Wouldn’t big players want the price high for a short? How does one short a stock without borrowing it?

Why even look at charts? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:11:54
I would call/go into your bank and ask them what their deal is and why they’re telling a financial third party you’re money doesn’t exist. Threaten to move your finances to competition if they do not comply. 
EDIT: It’s your money. Don’t ever forget that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:27
Hey are you looking at it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:11:38
That’s all currency is backed by in the first place - belief. The USD is backed by debt. Trillions of debt.

I’ve been depositing and withdrawing no problem for the past 10 months in bittrex.

It’s like a normal exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:34
I meant why? Why are you looking at it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:33:44
Exactly, I probably should’ve put an s at the end of my comment. My bad
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:08:48
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:34:56
Many alts run on btc blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:44
Yeah sure but do Wall Street guys have enough to mess around with a 250+ trillion dollar market cap?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:34:21
I’ll say this forever. Don’t look at the price or charts. Set a goal and only sell when you got that goal!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:56:40
Some people say the USD is the bubble (which makes sense considering it’s backed by debt), and bitcoin is the pin to pop it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:30
Stop looking at it. Set a price alert and be done with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:07

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:31
Why are you doing anything right now? Why look at it? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:53:08
Don’t look at it............seriously, don’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:26:17
I thought swing trading alts was crazy. Swing trading bitcoin? Insanity

Last time Andreas was on Joe's podcast:  
“People are uncomfortable with bitcoin because it represents changing one of the fundamental ancient technologies of civilization – money. We’ve only changed that technology four or five times in the history of human civilization. We’ve gone from bare bones barter system – ‘here’s a goat, give me three chickens,’ to systems of precious metals and other nice objects (feathers, shells, etc.), to exclusively precious metals, and then on to precious metals stamped with the faces of kings. And then at some point, around the 15th century, you start seeing certificates of deposit for very precious metals being exchanged - paper notes, ‘I have a deposit of gold here, I’m now going to move the gold from my deposit to your deposit. I’ll just give you the piece of paper that says you’re now the owner’ – paper money is introduced. Then plastic in the 1950s diners club, travelers checks, and then the first credit cards. Do you think each transition was smooth?” - Andreas Antonopoulos 9/7/2016

Is a credit card an option? Obviously only use what you can afford to lose/pay off immediately. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:41
That’s not what shorting is, you should stop trading and leave it alone for a few months. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:40:13
Best thing to do is not look at the price. Download an app that gives you price alerts. Set a goal and don’t sell until that goal!
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:09:28
You do realize you’ve only owned bitcoin for a day or two right? People have owned it for years. Through thick and thin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:40
Let’s look at this from a math perspective.  
0.07012597 * 14260.05 = $1,000.00  
0.02126553 * 14107.34 = $300.00  
So you sold for a total of $1,300.00 plus transaction fees ($36.00) so $1,300.00 - $36.00 = $1,264.00
0.09098205 * 13869 = $1261.83
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:36:27
Many alt coins haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:35
Stop looking at charts. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:54
If you’re freaking out over the money you put in - you put in too much. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:59:29
Stocks after fees and decade economic crashes still yielding strong profits? Truly curious
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:34
6-12% Annual gains are fantastic in the stock market.  2% annual inflation turns that into 4-10% annual gains. You then have brokerage fees, trading fees, and the inevitable taxes once you sell.  
EDIT: all the while hoping the economy doesn’t tank

And they just print fiat any time someone is approved a loan....
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:23
See, this is precisely why you don’t sit there watching charts. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:19:13
Yeah that’s shady man. May be worth a transfer, sorry to hear you’re having such a difficult time with your bank. It’s ridiculous anyone must jump through hoops to move their own hard earned money. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:46
Haha of course the US government is promoting off shore bank accounts!!

If you wake up in 2010 buying bitcoin should be the least of your worry’s.
