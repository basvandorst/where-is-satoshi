Well 4K resolution is actually 3840, so technically we've made it:)

How to become a millionaire with bitcoin - start with 2 million. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:44:43
Perhaps the narrow price range is a good thing? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:31
It's like when I see the moon through binoculars.

But I do recall that, over the last couple months, whenever btc price did rise, I would also end up with more of it due to the rise in alts.  But this has changed all of a sudden.  I'll balance things out by selling some alts, just wondering if something changed in particular, or if there's any known reason for this.

I know I'm going to the moon, but how do I get the lambo there? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:30:42
They should just rename it boring coin
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:45:37
Lol, it is indeed, going up. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:42:53
My technical analysis: Bitcoin will bounce off of 9k repeatedly, each time with a higher low.  This will continue until btc bounces between 9000 and 8999 for the rest of eternity. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:59:49
Good thing I loaded up at 7.8k :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:47:50
I cannot
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:41:37
Lol I agree...let's just admit it, we're all in this to make money, and it just so happens to be a new, interesting technology that has tons of future potential.  But let's just suppose that bitcoin were to sit at $8,500 forever, do we really think that all of these people would buy it just to say screw you to the man?  I doubt it.  We want it because we want our own personal stake in this new digital economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:46:22
Well to be fair, everyone here is just "some guy" to everyone else.  Unless you're a girl and that's what you're getting at. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:33:23
If we crack 9k, I'll eat a bowl of cereal and orange juice. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:38:34
I say it goes down to around 7500 then bounces back to 9.
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:29:12
Don't mind me, I'm new at reading these charts (gdax).  But this means that there's good support at 8,000...right? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:41:54
Just give it time, soon enough you can park the lambo in Harvard yard. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:35:44
Kind of off topic, but somebody really should create a privacy coin called "private bits". 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:10:39
Well at least it's holding at 8...it could be worse. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:51:29
It's like somebody threw bitcoin into the lake wearing cement slippers. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:06:45
A jizzbath sounds better than a bloodbath. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:11:42
I think they're gonna have to start making more lambos. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:02:05
We're going to the moon, just taking the scenic rout. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:34
Well...my account seems to be ok. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:24:00
Does anyone know why alts are all of a sudden falling with btc's rise? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:26:25
Watching gdax is making me a bit crazy...get it, "bit crazy"
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:25:30
Oh cool, who knew you can steal Bitcoin on twitter!
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:05:28
Bitcoin ain't dead, it just smells funny. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:50:29
Somebody wake me up when it goes above 11k or below 9. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:44:55
Well if I had 400 million, I would buy bitcoin with it as well.  It's the thought that counts. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:24:01
Fly me to the moon and let me sing among the stars
Let me see what life is like on jupiter and mars
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:56:09
Steady growth is good, but it would really be nice to clear 9k. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:27:45
It would be nice if it was correlated when the stock market goes up, but not when it goes down:)
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:12:59
Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn't.  The way she goes. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:57:08
Can't explain that
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:48:35
Let's hope this is apollo 11 and not Challenger. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:00:25
Hoping 10.2k is the bottom...I like big bottoms. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 05:41:07
I'd say the G&amp;M is more like the NY times and the National Post is more like the WSJ.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:59:16
I really wanted to buy there, but was out of cash...spent the last of it a 7800.  Maybe that wasn't so terrible though. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:34:22
We want bitcoin
Not a sore and itchy groin
