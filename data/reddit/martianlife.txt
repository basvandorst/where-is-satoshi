sorry about that.. I was in the process of editing and didn't see your reply.

FinCEN most likely is to blame,  I used to own Flexcoin until about a year or so ago I sold it to a Canadian company.    I thought this was going to happen when the Feds finally do make a ruling...  I got so concerned that I spent too (both money and effort) in it only to get eventually shut down because some idiot bought something somewhere using my "bitcoin bank'  hence everyone's deposits would be seized...  it was too much for me to handle ... so I sold the whole thing ..

They also use Credit Cards and Paypal,  however that's not specified in the report....  of course.

You guys are funny...  completely reminded me why I sold flexcoin in 2011.   Good luck people...

Today, SPV clients have to download the entire contents of blocks and all broadcast transactions, only to throw away the vast majority of the transactions that are not relevant to their wallets. This slows down their synchronization process, wastes users bandwidth (which on phones is often metered) and increases memory usage. All three problems are triggering real user complaints for the Android "Bitcoin Wallet" app which implements SPV mode. In order to make chain synchronization fast, cheap and able to run on older phones with limited memory we want to have remote peers throw away irrelevant transactions before sending them across the network.

pretty reliable,  pulls data from all the exchanges and then averages them.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:30:50
at that time it's safe to expect that out of the 21 million "mined" most likely 1/2 of them would be lost (you wouldn't believe how many coins out there sitting on broken un-backed up harddrives) ... so the value of each would be dramatically higher... and those transaction costs alone would be equal to a large sum of money.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:23:41
I agree more than you know.  We have to get over this issue of keeping coins because we believe the value will keep going up.    In order to build a valid bitcoin economy, we're going to have to spend them on goods and services.

you didn't see the screenshots on the report?

I can make it an official android app tonight.... and throw it up on Google Play.    I'll want to clean up the interface however.

They were user wallets, complete with coins.  Googlebot does not put coins in wallets.

We're not talking about a computer, we're talking about the 12 ounces of Gold you could have purchased for $3000,  now those 12 ounces are worth $20,000.00  The junky computer you have from 10 years ago is as worthless as that 3 year old pizza.

The standard measure of unit for silver is 1 oz
The standard measure of unit for bitcoin is 1 BTC
There isn't anything arbitrary about it.   
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:12:15
also this finally gives guidelines and legal outlook regarding bitcoin.  Overall it's positive and hence you can fully expect bitcoin to hit mainstream in a large way.

Thank god I sold flexcoin last year.
"An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11"

You can't compare two storage of wealth standard units?   "Should I invest in Google or Apple" .. clearly you can't make the determination which is a better investment..

10,000 bitcoins for a pizza...  that has to be a world record for most expensive pizza.
Someone needs to update this then :

I understand the blockchain issue,  my question would be is that all the community is concerned with?   I mean this guy made a successful business from bitcoins.  I've been busting my ass for quite some time building one and I achieved .00000001% of the success he did.

Quotes will display on the screen as well as scroll in ticker format across the top of the screen, and will refresh automatically every 2 minutes.  Bitcoin (BTC) in both US dollars and Euros as well as several other commodities such as Brent Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, Platinum and Palladium. Ounce.Me also calculates and displays the current Gold-to-Silver ratio, as well as our own Bitcoin Pizza Index and the current Bitcoin Market Cap.

yep.. all of them use a third party.. you want to run your own client on your mobile.. you download the blockchain or figure a way to transfer it to your mobile another way.   The article is pro-bitcoin , it's mostly a slam on AT&amp;T.

My tool averages them over multiple exchanges...   Now it's VERY possible that it's just a quick down blip and within a few hours it will start climbing again... but technically at this exact moment (2:44 EST)  it's $39.53 for 1 BTC.
