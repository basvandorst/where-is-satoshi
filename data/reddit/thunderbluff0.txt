The market can be irrational longer then you can stay solvent.

You're supposed to buy low and sell high. Try doing that next time.

Unless you are looking to buy!

Bitcoins will already be at the moon by then :-(

I disagree with you on just about every point. Most other commonly traded assets exist in very dynamic environments, that can change unpredictably. For example, a Q4 can instantly change the fate of a stock, like what happend NASDAQ: AYA. 
BTCs on the other hand is much purer; free from any noise. Nothing can physically happen to bitcoins, that would fundamentally change it's values. Fundamentally, I would argue, bitcoin have near 0 value.
Thus to me, Bitcoins should exclusively be traded technically, given that they are driven near entirely based on people's belief in them. What people as a whole believe the trading value to be, is always going to be the only thing to influence the price of bitcoin.

 Look at the weekly chart.

This is my analysis of the bitcoin charts. I drew a Fibonacci ratio and some trend lines so it must be accurate.

I think the reason bitcoin is so great is that it's unabannable. Sure china can ban trading bitcoins, but they have no technical means of banning bitcoins themselves. Therefore I think many Chinese will see this as the last chance to buy bitcoins, so they may not be looking to sell them. That said without their continued ability to participate in the market, the value of bitcoins in china will be irrelevant to the prices on other trading sites.
There will probably be a black market to trade bitcoins with cash in China at a much higher price and spread.

This is an opinion only:
If governments attack bitcoin or try to ban it, all it really does is promote that they are scared of it, which given the purpose of bitcoin, actually makes it more valuable.
Basically, if governments try to ban bitcoins, they are admitting that they see them as a threat to their own monetary systems. The more threatening bitcoins appear, the more valuable they will appear. Or at least that's how I think the market would likely perceive it.

There are many posts on reddit about bitcoin prices which are mostly based on belief, and not on logic. Yes it is very likely that Bitcoin will continue to rise along its original upwards trend line.
But anything that doesn't at least mention the probability of a crash is probably incorrect. Of course, there are many great possibilities for bitcoin, and it is likely a good investment in the long run; but in the short run, there here and now, the likelihood of a return the the mean (or a crash in panic speak), is more probable based on past behaviour.
I encourage you to read about elliott waves  as up until now BTC has pretty much followed this pattern very closely.
This is not to say that occasionally things may deviate. I would imagine bitcoin is the perfect candidate to test the actual validity of the elliott wave theory.

I think where your long argument falls flat is that you don't believe the market will self regulate. One crypto will always be exchangeable for another, and the price will always be based on supply and demand. Who's to say as cryptos become more common payment processors won't simply process the transaction from any crypto to another for a small transaction fee, just like you can buy something in euros with usd.

We haven't even reached the middle of capitulation.
