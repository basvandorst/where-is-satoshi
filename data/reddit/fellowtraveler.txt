Payment codes are re-usable, without the privacy implications of re-using Bitcoin addresses.
Payment codes provide a return address, without having to ask the other party to provide one.
Payment codes are private -- only the 2 parties can see their transaction history, the rest is not viewable on the blockchain.

That's the whole problem. You see, there are actually _billions_ of people on the earth. What percentage of the adult population does not use formal or semiformal financial services? Over half. Including 80% of sub-saharan Africa, 65% of Latin America, 59% of southeast Asia, etc. Even a sizable percentage of adults in the United States.
Many adults worldwide who _do_ have financial services are stuck with capital controls and currencies that wildly inflate. You may not see this as a problem in the USA, but it's a very real problem in Argentina (for example.)


This is incredibly myopic and makes me cringe. A few points:
* Having had firsthand experience, I can say that the cost and hassle of a credit card merchant account is incredibly prohibitive, and is a real barrier to entry.
* It also boosts prices. Notice that businesses accepting Bitcoin often offer a 10-15% discount on prices. That difference in price represents a very real "tax" on credit card users that covers not just merchant fees, but also delays, chargeback risk, rolling reserve, etc.
* Credit card payments only hit the bank account once per week, versus Bitcoin payments which arrive instantly. This is the sort of difference that distinguishes between 20th and 21st century payment systems.
* Wire transfers carry fees up to $50. ACH transfers can take up to 3-5 business days. International wires can take weeks. Remittance options are few and far between, and those that exist practice price-gouging. This is absolutely ridiculous.
* Accounts can be closed, frozen or confiscated and often are. Use Google to look up complaints from PayPal users, for example. Stories are often in the news regarding "undesirables" who are unable to get a bank account or a credit card merchant account.
* None of these points even consider the lack of solutions for p2p transfers.
New payments technology such as Bitcoin not only solves these problems, but also opens up whole new spaces in areas such as micropayments and resource allocation between cloud APIs.
Bitcoin is going to change the world and New York is going to end up irrelevant if it doesn't take it seriously. The risk is very real that their regulatory regime will cause the Internet to route around them.

Servers don't need to find each other. In voting pools, they are already aware of the other pool members, who are all signers to the pool contract.
If you want to move funds from one to another, that's what the blockchain's for. That will work for normal bitcoins as well as colored coins.

Being the author, stumbling across this thread, I can answer this question.
First off, keep in mind that all transactions in OT are signed by the client first, and then only counter-signed by the server. So for example, if you sign a request to send funds to Bob, the server will validate and then counter-sign your request, but the server cannot forge any transfers because the server cannot forge your signature. (Also FYI, the counter-signed request becomes your receipt, which is also your "account" since it proves your current balance.)
Similarly, if you sign a market offer, the server is able to process trades against that offer until it is complete (or cancelled, or expired.) It doesn't need any further signatures from you to do that, since it already has a copy of the signed offer, which is included in all the trade receipts.
Also keep in mind that the receipt contains a copy of your last signed balance. If your last signed balance was 100 clams, and you had 15 clams worth of trade receipts, then your current balance would be 85 clams. The server proves this via your last signed receipt, minus your trade receipts.


The server processes the trade against the buyer's and seller's accounts, with authorization provided via their signed market offers. They don't need to be online for this to happen, similar to MtGox. They don't need to sign each trade as it happens, as long as they signed their initial market offers. (The difference between OT and MtGox is, your balance in OT can only change if you have signed to authorize it. OT is able to process trades even when you aren't online, because you already previously signed the market offer.)


The OT server will not directly hold your BTC or colored coins. Instead, they will be in a multi-sig voting pool on the blockchain itself. This enables the OT server to issue units internally based on those coins, **but without having to trust the OT server not to steal those coins.**

2% of the world's population lives in the U.S.
I agree that clarifying regulation is a good thing vis-a-vis the current vague state of things, but isn't this a free speech issue?
If we can regulate what kind of math people speak to each other, can we also regulate how they talk about sex, politics, religion? Can we require licenses to discuss animals or food? Can we jail unlicensed singers or poets? It sounds ridiculous but this sort of thing is painfully real in other parts of the world, and apparently (with regards to math) it is becoming the same way in the U.S.
The only reason our authoritarian rulers are arrogant and overconfident is because the people are not educated on, and standing up to demand, their natural rights. And freedom of speech is a pretty basic one.

Bitcoin is already backed by gold.
Whenever you want some gold, just sell your Bitcoin for some gold.
Whenever you want to "deposit" your gold in the "bank" just sell the gold for some Bitcoin.
Whenever you want to "withdraw" your gold back out of the "bank" just sell the Bitcoin for some gold.

Open-Transactions is an essential component to the voting pools. Also, multi-sig on the blockchain is essential. Also the Monetas Auditor is an essential component--and it audits the Notary, including all the financial instruments and market exchange.

The official fees are much smaller than the actual cost.
Otherwise, why would merchants be willing to drop their prices by 10-15% when people pay in Bitcoin?
That's similar to the price cut many are willing to offer when you pay in cash.
Because there is a lot more hassle and cost to operating a merchant account than just the credit card fees alone. A big part of Bitcoin's value is its irreversibility.

@_date: 2014-10-27 21:02:06
In short: normally a contract in OT has an ID which is a hash of the contract. You cannot change the contract without changing the ID. (This is a security feature.)
The drawback is that you cannot change the contract.
The fix is to use a smart property ID as the contract ID. Then post the contract hash in the blockchain for that smart property. Since smart properties can change over time, it makes it possible for us to have a consistent, secure ID for a contract, even though the contract changes over time.
We need this since, for example, voting pool contracts must change over time as members are added/removed to/from the pool.
Transaction-based issuing is suited for this capability which is one of the primary reasons we went with ChromaWallet.
As I said, Coinprism is a cool project and I wish them well, but this was a core functionality for us so we didn't really have a choice.

You are correct that the Federal Government would most likely employ violence in the event of secession, but that doesn't mean they have a moral right to do so.

_We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness._

I'm not an accountant, so I would consult one if I were you.
But it sounds like in the case of mining, it's not capital gains. Rather, you are in the business of mining and should be able to deduct the cost of the computer and electricity. (From what I understand, computers aren't really depreciated anymore and are just deducted.)
In the case of the trades you did, each trade would be a taxable event, and you would need to deal with those trades individually re: capital gains tax.
It's a big mess IMO. Any substance that could be considered "money," including gold and Bitcoin, should not be taxable as capital gains IMO. But the current system is explicitly set up to discourage the use of any other form of "money" except dollars.
That's why Bitcoin was invented in the first place -- to provide a refuge of freedom from the current despicable system.

To quote the article, _"Address-based coloring is also incapable of creating a type of virtual token known as_ smart property, _which is a type that Monetas plans to use extensively."_
Smart property is necessary for the ability to add/remove members to a Monetas voting pool -- a critical piece of functionality for what we're building.

You are confusing two things, the currency itself, and the various financial instruments.
First let's look at the worst possible case. The worst case is that you have some server which controls a ledger, AND holds all the Bitcoins (like MtGox.)
Open-Transactions eliminates both of those problems.
First, an OT server cannot change the ledger since it cannot forge your signature. Your account, in OT, is simply the _last signed receipt_ and since the _users_ form (and sign) the receipts -- with the server only countersigning -- the OT server is unable to forge transactions or change balances.
Second, by storing the Bitcoin into a voting pool, we make it impossible for the OT server to steal any of those coins.
The result is that while an OT server is able to notarize transactions, it is unable to fiddle with account balances, and it is unable to steal the Bitcoins.
Of course, an OT server could still _refuse_ to notarize a transaction, but in that case, you would just use another OT server instead.
FINALLY, with regard to the Chaumian tokens. Any financial instrument, in OT, must be redeemed at the same server where it was created. So if I send you a cheque drawn on server A, then your client software will redeem that cheque on server A as well. Similarly, if I send you a piece of cash drawn on server A, then your client will redeem that cash on server A as well.
And as I said above, while a server can refuse to process transactions, people would just move their funds to another server instead. The voting pool protocol, for example, makes it easy to shift your funds to server B instead of server A, if server A isn't being cooperative.
In summation, OT uses servers, but no single server is an authority over your funds.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:01:56
The purpose of voting pools is so you can do things INSIDE the namespace of the notary, but safely so that the notary cannot steal the coins.
If the notary disappears or refuses to process transactions, you simply move the funds to another server in the pool and continue on as if nothing had ever happened.

The problem is, the "issuer" changes over time. As members are added/removed to/from the voting pool, you can end up in a future situation where the current members of the pool are entirely different entities than the original members of the pool.
One of the requirements, especially for voting pool contracts, is that not even the original creators of the contract can produce a counterfeit smart property.
With Coinprism this is not possible, since you have to trust that the original member(s) have destroyed the issuance key. It's not possible in Coinprism to prove key destruction.
Transaction-based coloring solves this problem very well, because nobody can create a duplicate outpoint without breaking SHA256 and also rewriting the history of the blockchain.
Therefore, as I said before, we had to choose ChromaWallet for purely technical reasons, since Coinprism is not able to prove key destruction, whereas ChromaWallet doesn't have to prove key destruction.
The integrity of the pool cannot be left up to trust that someone destroyed a key. There could be a lot of money in that pool.

Often it's none of these things. Often they just temporarily deactivate your card and you have to call in to get it re-activated.
Often this happens right when you need it the most, like when you are traveling in Germany and have no other source of funds, and then your bank is closed and you have no way of reaching them to get the card turned back on.
I have gone through that kind of crap so many times, even when the card itself was perfectly good and had plenty of money on it.

Well an LLC is a flow-through entity so the taxes would still fall onto the members of the LLC, to their personal taxes. And since you live in California, you would still pay California tax on that.
Also, if you are doing business in California then you would need to foreign-qualify the LLC to do business in California, at which point you might as well have formed a California LLC in the first place, even though the corporate veil in California is a piece of shit.
Also if the business is formed in Nevada, usually the reason is so you can open a Nevada bank account, meaning you'd need at least one trusted employee with a Nevada driver's license.
(I'm not a lawyer or accountant BTW, and this post doesn't constitute any kind of advice.)
The best thing probably would be to actually get residency in Nevada, but California will have trouble letting you out of their clutches -- Franchise Tax Board auditors will go so far as to track you down inside Nevada. They will definitely check out your bank records and phone records to see where you are spending your time.
Best is probably just to get the hell out of California before they build a Berlin Wall so you can never escape.

Inflation is the only possible crime, since the notary can't forge a user's receipts.
But inflation can be prevented: Notaries should be storing reserves in a voting pool, which prevents any individual notary from inflating receipts or stealing reserves.
The reason is because the other notaries in the pool (specifically their auditor software) will only authorize outbailments from the pool, for notaries who have a clean audit. So they are all auditing each other in real time. This prevents any notaries from inflating. If they tried, they would lose access to their funds in the pool.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:58:49
The purpose of the voting pool is so that bitcoins (and colored coins) can be safely stored, enabling off-chain transactions by Monetas notaries, in such a way that the notary server itself is physically unable to steal those coins.
Even if the notary server disappears entirely, the coins are still recoverable by the multisig (the other members of the pool.)
Once the coins are safely in the pool, you can use the notary server for various functionality such as market exchange, chaumian cash, etc.


If this happened, the funds would be moved to another notary server in the voting pool. The offline server would probably be kicked out of the pool. The users would be basically unaffected and could continue with full access to their money. (That's the whole reason for voting pools...)

The Constitution is based on enumerated powers. There are no legitimate Federal powers outside of those enumerated in it. And there is no enumerated power to emit a fiat currency.
Preventing counterfeiting is one of the responsibilities of the Federal Government:
_"The Congress shall have Power To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States."_
So how is it that the government has become the biggest perpetrator of the very crime they are meant to prevent?
I would also like to point out that the Federal Government was never given any power to emit bills of credit (aka fiat money.) They were only enumerated the power to **coin** money, and to fix the standards of **weights** thereof, for the purpose of providing a well-regulated and consistent value across the several States:
_"The Congress shall have Power To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures."_
If the current system of money cannot be valued based on some standard weight, then how can it be anything but counterfeit? And if Congress was not given authority to create money beyond "coin" that has "weight" then how can doing so today be anything but unconstitutional?
States were also prohibited from coining money (so as not to have 50 different standards of weight) and they were also explicitly prohibited from emitting bills of credit. They were also prohibited from making _"anything but gold and silver"_ a tender in payment of a debt:
_"No State shall...coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts...."_
It seems the intentions of the Founders are quite clear.

Monetas voting pools include proof-of-solvency, but it's not as important as the voting pool itself, which already prevents server thefts.
Once the coins (bitcoins or colored coins) are safe in the voting pool, then transactions, such as Chaumian cash, can occur off-chain in the Monetas notary server.
So yes, there will be Chaumian cash, but it will occur in the notary server, not on the blockchain itself.

Rather, I want to move to a system where I have a hardware wallet with a screen, and Bitcoins.
To answer your question (why haven't we...) I believe the answer is simple: because banks have to pay (have to make us pay) for reversibility anyway, for regulatory compliance reasons. As a result, the replacement system you propose wouldn't lessen costs for them very much, and it would be expensive enough to replace the current system that they'd currently prefer inconveniencing us and writing-off any losses. Especially since people don't have a choice anyway, since the banking system doesn't have any real competition. This is helping to create a market opening for Bitcoin.

From the perspective of the Bazaar, *no,* this is not the case.
You don't have to register your Nym on an OT server *at all* unless you want to use that server to notarize things for you.
The Bazaar is entirely client-side... the clients discover each other in Bitmessage channels. Technically speaking, they don't have to use OT servers at all, except if they choose to use them for payments, or for escrow purposes.
The clients don't need the OT servers in order to have p2p marketplaces. They would just communicate directly over Bitmessage.
They also wouldn't need OT servers for payments, if they prefer to do the payments directly on the blockchain (since Moneychanger is able to use Bitcoin...)
Once voting pools are ready, an OT server will be unable to steal the Bitcoin, and at that point I expect most of the transactions to occur in OT rather than directly on the blockchain. But that's a choice for the individual users.

Consider, if the Fed had to be actively involved in all cash transactions, then they would definitely have the potential ability to whitelist or de-authorize accounts.
You're correct that the Fed and Doug Jackson are NOT equivalent. Obviously the Fed is much more powerful, yet if they had the power to de-authorize Saddam Hussein's account, or require KYC authorization for any account, then they could still be susceptible to pressure to do so.
Personally I don't think they even want to be in the position to have to answer to such pressure. Even though they are more _able_ to resist pressure, I don't think they even want it to be a question. It's not their core business. With paper cash, it's not even a question. And with colored coins, the same is true. It's the first technology that is comparable to paper cash in that way.


I think you are right that a major property of cash is censorship-resistance, which we also see in the blockchain.
And I do think that central banks issue paper cash, as I explained in the article, because they _have_ to, not because they want to, because of their primary interest in having people use their currency instead of _something else,_ and because they know that people will resort to alternatives (such as Bitcoin) if cash isn't available.

When you say "the law" are you referring to the historical meaning of the term, which preceded legislation, and which involved the prosecution of actual crimes with actual victims, such as murder and robbery? No man is above this law, not even the king (or the majority) -- and no man has the authority to change it.
Or rather, do you intend to mean, _"Whatever the king (or majority) says shall be illegal, is therefore against the law, even if there is no victim"_ ? This is the form that applies to harboring Jews during the Holocaust, or selling beer during Prohibition.
It seems to me that many abuses of justice stem from the failure to comprehend the difference between these two meanings. Just curious which one you had in mind.

No, but they would have the technical ability to require them. Whereas with paper cash and with the blockchain, there is no such technical ability.
They would also have to actively process the transactions. Whereas with paper cash and with the blockchain, transactions occur entirely independent of and divorced from any direct action of the Fed.
These are two pieces of liability that do not exist with paper cash or with the blockchain. The blockchain is thus very similar to paper cash in ways that no other technology is.


Sure, but law enforcement could say that _now_ about paper cash. So why don't they? Because then people would start using _something else._
Remember, the central bank is extremely powerful, and their number-one concern is simply that people use their money instead of _something else._
Also, the blockchain is pretty trackable. Paper cash is also easily trackable as well (let's not kid ourselves, the notes are serialized and probably scanned on deposit.)
I wouldn't be entirely surprised if a central bank ran their own central server for digital cash, as you suggest. But I think that using the blockchain would work even better for their purposes.

That's true. In a country such as the USA where the people and the states no longer have any fair representation in the Federal Government, they therefore have no say in who gets a Visa (or in anything else, for that matter.) That's the same reason why the taxes are so high in the first place that otherwise good citizens are being forced to flee.

What I mean is that the incentive that drives a central bank to issue paper cash is the same incentive that will drive them to issue on the blockchain.
If the incentive did not exist, they would not issue paper cash at all. But they do, because they must, because natural market forces drive people to use cash, and they want people to use _their_ cash instead of _something else._ (And people _will_ use something else, otherwise.)
I believe the blockchain actually serves that natural incentive more effectively than paper cash does. Therefore the central bank who issues on the blockchain will have a competitive advantage relative to other central banks. And the one who does it first, will have a first-mover advantage.

This is so important a point for people to understand. The functions we use trusted exchanges for, are going to be taken over by software and devices.

That way when people deal with regulated gateways, it is only fiat-for-fiat instead of fiat-for-Bitcoin. No one will ever have any incentive to cancel your order based on Bitcoin price movements, because the regulated entity will no longer handle Bitcoin at all.
Then users can directly exchange coin A for coin B, with each other, using software, instead of having to deal with regulated exchanges.

Furthermore, it's a degree of coercion that I don't think anyone would tolerate if it weren't for the threat of "terrorists." Aside from that one excuse, likely we'd all otherwise perceive what's going on here as financial authoritarianism, mainly targeting law-abiding citizens.

For a technical overview, the first article you should read is this one, which will clarify for you, how destruction of account history works: 
OT uses a system that is slightly more complicated (in order to allow for recurring transactions) but the concepts are the same. So if you really want to understand how OT works, that's the first article you should read.
BTW -- I should mention that article is linked from the OT wiki, so you might want to browse through the wiki as well:  
Here is another article (also linked from the wiki) which provides an excellent broad overview (from a different angle) regarding the OT server:  
Video walkthroughs with technical explanation:  
Some high-level diagrams:

These are all linked from the wiki, and there's a lot more there.
Also, the source code is there for those who wish to just read it directly. It's pretty straightforward.
There will be more documentation posted (UML diagrams, security protocol docs, etc) over the next few months, as fast as we can get it out.
The easiest way to understand OT is probably just to build it and play around with it...
Certainly you will learn more about OT that way, than you will learn on Reddit.

Please see this article:  
"Untraceable digital cash" is a reference to digital cash which uses blind signatures in order to make it impossible to link the withdrawal to the subsequent deposit. Any legitimate "blind mixers" in use by the Bitcoin community will most likely be using the same technology.


The cash is an instrument, not a currency. For example, you could have a gold-based currency, or you could have a Bitcoin-based currency, or you could have a dollar-based currency, etc... and amounts in these currencies can be transacted using the cash instrument, or the cheque instrument, or the markets, etc. So the currency and the instruments are two different things.


There are many various implementations of blind signatures and other homomorphic crypto.
OT uses this one:    (The Wagner algorithm.)
However, I have designed OT to make it easy for swapping in different algorithms. So for example, if you wanted to use the PGP Chaum implementation ("Magic Money") that is possible. I believe Microsoft has released a free implementation of Stefan Brands' work.


I think your mistake here is you are still trying to think of OT as a purported replacement for Bitcoin, as opposed to a replacement for GLBSE and other such things.


The server can never change your balance without your signature on the request. So you never have to trust the server regarding your balance.
The server can never forge any transactions on your behalf. So you never have to trust the server regarding your transactions.
The server can never lie about the total units of any currency issued--so the issuer always knows exactly how many units he is liable for (because he has the transaction server's signature on the last receipt.) The issuer's last receipt will _always_ show the correct total units issued.
Therefore if the server _were_ to commit inflation, it cannot do so without signing the amounts, and it cannot escape an audit. If there is real-time auditing between the issuer and the transaction server, then yes, you can trust the transaction server.
Keep in mind: as far as OT is concerned, the _issuer_ is the one you have to trust, since **he's the one who is physically holding your gold.** There is simply no getting around the requirement to audit the physical gold--there is no software protocol in the world which can change that. (For physical assets, that is. There is, of course, one _virtual_ solution: Bitcoin. Which is what makes BTC so special relative to other assets like gold.)
So given the fact that we have to trust the issuer...
1. If the issuer is operating the transaction server, then the point is moot, since we have to trust the issuer anyway, and since he can't lie on any of our receipts.
2. If the issuer is not operating the transaction server (there's a separate operator), then an auditing protocol must be in place between the issuer and the transaction server. But in this case, the server has no incentive to fail an audit, since he isn't holding any of the gold (the issuer is.) What's he going to get away with? At most the issuer will re-issue the users' units onto another transaction server, while the cheating server immediately loses his daily revenue from transaction fees to other servers. Meanwhile the gold still sits in the issuer's vault the whole time.


I have been quite vocal about all of these issues for years, so there is no need to act surprised. I encourage you to Google it to read more discussion about all of this.


All that matters is that the issuer audits the receipts from the same place where the users retrieve them.
This doesn't have to be a DHT, but I think a DHT is probably the best solution. (But you would already know that, if you have read my articles, since that is what I have proposed.)


Tell that to Voucher Safe:
To me, an auditing protocol just becomes part of the system. To you, apparently, it's a no-go. Meanwhile MtGox can change your balance to whatever they want -- is there a signed receipt? Meanwhile MyBitcoin disappears with everyone's money. Is this preferable? Meanwhile GLBSE disappears and the stock issuers have no way of re-issuing their shares elsewhere. This is the situation you have now.


Technically, you trust _issuers._
The server cannot lie about your balance. It cannot lie about the total amount issued. It cannot fake any of your transactions. And it does not store any of your gold.
At most, the server could inflate the currency -- but only if the issuer isn't watching. In which case, you have a trust problem with the _issuer,_ not the server itself (which cannot escape the auditing process.) And remember, since the issuer is holding your physical gold, OT was never intended to eliminate the need to trust the issuer, which is physically impossible. Of all the assets in existence, the only exception to this is Bitcoin, since multisig makes it possible for a voting pool (on the blockchain) to act as the "issuer." Those Bitcoins thus could not be stolen without X-out-of-Y pool members voting in favor of the theft. Even if the transaction server disappears entirely, your Bitcoins would still be recoverable through the same vote. But this is not what happened with MyBitcoin, is it? They just disappeared with everyone's money, and no one could prove their balances, and no one could recover their coins. This is an example of why the Bitcoin community needs a more standard and secure system which is easy for developers to use.

Doesn't the "real world empirical evidence" show that central banking, starting in 1913, caused the bubble that eventually led to the crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression?
And doesn't it show that the Keynesian spending afterwards resulted in _extending_ the length of the Great Depression in the USA, even while other nations (with better policies) were already digging their way out?
And doesn't it show that central economic planning has been an abject failure wherever it has been attempted?
And doesn't it show that fiat currencies never live much beyond 40 years?
And isn't it clear that our current "Greatest Depression", which is just beginning, was caused directly as a result of these same mechanisms we see in history, except this time playing out on a much larger scale?
And when people are starving and rioting this time around, due to all the economic misallocation, and electing the next Hitler, how will you possibly blame it on gold and free markets this time, when we've had neither for decades?

The wiki is quite clear, but I will repeat it for your benefit:
The cash instrument is **untraceable.** This is true even if you use accounts. _This is true even if you do not use Tor._
I say this because even if the server can see your IP, and even if the server can see that your account made a withdrawal or that my account made a deposit, the server nevertheless has no way of linking my withdrawal to your deposit. There is simply no way of linking them -- **the cash is completely untraceable.**
Now go a step further. Eliminate all accounts, and both of us use it in cash-only mode. Now, not only is the cash untraceable, but additionally the server can no longer tell which accounts are withdrawing and depositing, since there are no "accounts." The server can still see our IPs, but it can't link any of the payments. That is, it might see my IP do a cash token exchange, and it might see your IP do a cash token exchange, but it has no way of knowing that these two IPs exchanged money, because again, **the cash is completely untraceable.** 
Now go the final step: run it over Tor. At this point, the server cannot even see our IPs and traffic analysis becomes much more difficult or impossible. **It's only at this point, as I say all over my wiki, that we become "fully-anonymous."**
But make no mistake, the cash _is_ untraceable, even without Tor. Payments cannot be linked.


I'm not sure where you get the idea that I have ever done otherwise. There is nothing in our discussion here which is not already on the wiki. Certainly the difference between anonymity / untraceability / pseudonymity is very well-explained on the wiki, as well as shown in these diagrams:
Fully-anonymous: 
Pseudo-anonymous: 
In fact, the second question on the OT FAQ is: _"EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'NUMBERED ACCOUNTS' and 'UNTRACEABLE' and 'ANONYMOUS'"_

So I'm really not sure what you mean there, but if you have specific quotes of me making outlandish claims, then let's see them. Otherwise, perhaps the outlandish claims are all on your side of the equation.

While OT currently uses OpenSSL, it was designed to easily swap out the crypto lib (for example, if you wanted to substitute GPG.)
Therefore, if you are looking at OT as something that would be used _instead_ of GPG, then you are looking at it all wrong. Rather, OT is something that might _use_ GPG in the course of doing its work.
Basically you are saying, _"Why would I use OT to automate all the things that OT makes easy, when I could just do them all by hand in a more painstaking manner?"_ But if this was the right angle, then it would be inappropriate to build GPG into any other software. For example, there is a GPG plugin for Thunderbird -- why not just encrypt emails by hand? There is a GPG front-end for linux -- but why use it? Why not just the command-line interface instead? Why build GPG into anything at all?

The server could accept the same piece of cash twice, but it would have to sign this in order to do it, and then it would _owe_ that money. Such actions cannot be concealed in OT. It would also thus fail an audit.


Depends on how often you audit. Could be real-time auditing, or could be daily auditing (with daily limits on out-bailments.) Depends on how well the issuer trusts the transaction server. (Meaning: real-time auditing is probably an unnecessary expense if the entities are legally servable, but might become fully-necessary for anonymous servers.)


You said yourself that you have a better understanding now -- but everything I have written here is already available on the Wiki, and written in the same voice.
**The promises are fulfilled based on how the software is operated.**
For example: the cash instrument is untraceable, (but the other instruments are not untraceable.)
Another example: The cash is untraceable _even if you are using accounts._ (But you can also use OT without opening any asset accounts.)
Another: the transaction server has more liability if it operates using all the instruments, since these can be monitored and thus create a liability to expend resources monitoring and reporting on various activities. Whereas the transaction server has less liability if it operates in cash-only mode, since transactions become anonymous and untraceable. (I guess I should say, "over Tor" as well, since otherwise IP information still becomes reportable.)
Thus another: The cash instrument itself is fully untraceable, but you could not say it was _"anonymous"_ unless it was operated over **Tor,** in **cash-only mode.** Otherwise you would say that it is "pseudonymous and untraceable" (whereas Bitcoin, FYI, is pseudonymous and _traceable.)_
Another: OT is able to prove all balances and transactions while simultaneously destroying all account history. This doesn't mean that OT _can't_ store account history. It also doesn't mean that users would be _wise_ to destroy their account history. (They wouldn't be.) But it _does_ mean that if the account history _were_ destroyed, the actors involved would all still be able to prove their balances, and prove which instruments are valid and which transactions have closed. And this, again, greatly lowers the liability involved in operating a server or in using OT in general.
Another: If Bitcoins are issued onto the OT server using a normal issuer (i.e. _without_ using voting pools) then that issuer could steal your Bitcoins, just the same as a gold issuer could steal your gold. But didn't I say that we could lower this risk...? Yes we can -- but only with Bitcoin and not with other currencies.
_...Because if you issue the BTC onto OT using multisig / voting pools,_ then suddenly Bitcoin becomes _the only asset type_ that is **nearly free of issuer risk on OT.** (The remaining risk being that the multisig keyholders choose to lie, against protocol.) Not even gold is so safe. Using multisig, X-out-of-Y pool voters would have to authorize an illicit out-bailment, against their own interests.
With gold we do not have such luxuries, but similar solutions are implemented. For example, the purpose of separating the issuers and transaction servers into separate and multiple entities, is to create a federated model (as opposed to a client/server model -- similar to Diaspora) such that risk becomes distributed to the point where it becomes manageable, even with gold. Such that a single gold currency could be issued across multiple servers in multiple jurisdictions, for example. And so each server could have multiple different gold currencies trading on the same server. And so that users can distribute the risk of multiple issuers across a single currency (using baskets) with insurance picking up the difference. Etc.
I understand that it's a lot to take in -- financial crypto is byzantine at best, and OT, being a library first, has the capability to be used in many, many different ways. But the features advertised on the Wiki are already fully-functional and have been through pretty rigorous testing so far.
Would I do more? Absolutely. I have a security expert starting in December, putting together our official protocol document. There is now a unit test folder that is growing. Additionally I've hired a C++ architect already to model and document everything. I would also fix all the todo's in the code, and all the issues listed on Github. I would perform static and dynamic analysis with various tools and clean up all their output. I'd want the open source community to "kick the tires" (people such as yourself) as well as contribute expertise and work beyond my own individual time and powers. I'd want test servers to operate for years while hackers drill the software. I'd want a full Q/A team with a lab, bug tracking, load testing, regression testing, etc. I'm in no hurry and I believe in doing things right.

This is a common misconception. The bank doesn't invest your money. Your deposits expand the bank's base, allowing it to create more money through loans. (This is where others have described inflation as "stealing from Grandma" which, of course, it is.) If the bank makes bad loans and the bank goes under, then "stealing from taxpayers" is also performed in order to bail out the bank or the accountholders.

Store the Bitcoins in a transaction server, and then it's possible to perform real-time transactions on them.
Further, instead of directly transferring the coins to the server operator, transfer them to a pool on the blockchain (multisig) so that they cannot be stolen by the transaction server itself, which becomes a mere cloud commodity, instead of an authority.
This way you can safely use Bitcoins on a transaction server, where you have access to perform instant transactions, untraceable transactions, etc.

So true! As Bastiat wrote:
_If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right — its reason for existing, its lawfulness — is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups._
_Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, contrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own individual rights. Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to destroy the equal rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separately can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force that is nothing more than the organized combination of the individual forces?_
_If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than this: The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all._
If you think about it, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin. A protocol has been devised which perfectly protects the _individual rights,_ via enforcement by the majority. Only of course, the technical solution is more perfect than its political analogue, since mathematics are much more exacting in their implementation, and not just in theory.


So far Bitcoin is maintained by the majority _due to their own self-interest,_ but the _effect_ is to protect each individual.
Just the same as Bastiat's description of the purpose and effect, when implemented properly, of The Law itself.

You should keep records and be able to prove all transfers in court. This is why the return process can only involve an address that you specify at the time the request is requested, because it will prevent someone from producing a record of some UNRELATED Bitcoin transaction and then CLAIMING that is "him returning the funds."  No evidence of transfer is acceptable unless the BTC address on the evidence matches the BTC address on the return request.

One more thing I should add... many of the things that OT does, are things that people in the Bitcoin community are already building. Such as market exchanges, wallets, blind mixers, etc.

The reason you don't have to trust the server is because the server cannot forge your signature on your transaction request (a copy of which is included on the reply receipt.) Therefore the server can never forge any of your balances or transactions, because the server does not have your private key.
Your "account" _is_ the last signed receipt, which you have a copy of, which means you still have your "account" even if the server disappears entirely.
The current prototype of OT does not use a DHT, but one is planned in the future, for the auditing protocol.
One thing to make clear: Understand there's a big difference between needing to use a third party _as a cloud commodity_ versus needing to use a third party _as a trusted authority._
OT server is a cloud commodity that can be offered by third parties. But this does NOT mean that these servers must be trusted as authorities. People tend to confuse the two concepts.

**Here is the answer you seek...**
Regarding Bitcoins and gold, it's important to keep in mind that neither has "intrinsic" value.
Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.
Gold is:
* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
By comparison:
* Diamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.
* Water, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.
* Food, while valuable, is not durable.
* Dollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)
* Dollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).
* Dollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)
* Food, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.
* Dollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)
Soon it becomes very clear that gold was never "declared" to be a form of money by any "authorities" but rather, became money due to natural market forces.
If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender "laws", tax "laws", money laundering "laws", etc.)
Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.
**Now let's consider Bitcoin's unique properties:**
* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
AS WELL AS:
* Non-confiscatable.
* Accounts cannot be frozen.
* Anonymity is possible.
* Electronically transferrable.
As you can see, Bitcoin's unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.
Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the government's collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.

*"You further understand that BTC is subject to wild market fluctuations in price, and that refunds cannot exceed the current market value of the coins that you return to us, nor can refunds be issued more than 30 days after your purchase."*
Again, I am not a lawyer, and I recommend you run this language by your own attorney. People are losing chargebacks only because they are failing to keep these sorts of agreements on file for each of their customers.

Question: Would such a DHT be safe for this purpose without using a blockchain as the DHT?
Leading to: I think this is what Namecoin does. (Uses a blockchain in order to have consensus about an email address, an i2p address, etc.) Is this what you are looking for? If not, what's different?

Open-Transactions is a software library (along with a server and a client API) which makes it easy for developers to build financial cryptography into their own software. Through the OT API, in most languages and on most platforms, users can issue currencies (based on currency contracts) as well as open accounts, write/deposit cheques, withdraw/deposit cash, create basket currencies, trade bid/ask on markets, pay dividends, and create custom-scripted smart contracts.
OT is able to do all of this with _destruction of account history,_ which means it is able to prove all balances, as well as prove which instruments are valid, and which transactions are closed, without having to store any transaction history (other than the _last signed receipt.)_
The cash on OT is _untraceable digital cash,_ which is accomplished through _Chaumian blinding._ Using OT in cash-only mode, and operating on an anonymous network, it is possible to have a system of fully-anonymous cash. And if Bitcoin is used with OT, then it is additionally possible to do this _at a profit, anonymously._


I know, financial crypto is pretty complicated stuff. Even experts often have trouble wrapping their minds around the concepts. Don't feel bad.


I guess the simplest way to convey this is through a small mental puzzle: Just think of how you would accomplish the above functionality _without_ using a server. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a serverless system that is able to issue currencies based on any asset type, provide a variety of instruments including market trades, cheques, baskets, and untraceable cash, and do all of this _without_ storing any transaction history. _(Trust me, this accomplishment will bring you great fame and fortune.)_
BTW, it's not exactly correct to think of OT as _"client/server"_ as in, _"your email client, which always connects to the same email server."_
Instead, think of OT as _"federated"_ as in, _"your web browser, which may interact with dozens or hundreds of web servers behind the scenes."_
Regarding Bitcoin, it would be an egregious mistake to think of OT and Bitcoin as competitive technologies. For example, even if Bitcoin didn't exist, OT would still be useful for trading all other asset types. Furthermore, the functionality in OT is vital to Bitcoin itself. Otherwise, why would those in the Bitcoin community be building currency exchanges, web wallets, desktop wallets, mobile wallets, stock exchanges, blind mixes, etc? Clearly they need those things or they would not be building them. OT makes it easier for them to do it, and thus eliminates a lot of unnecessary duplication of work.
When OT and Bitcoin are combined, you gain a censorship-resistant system which is able to perform untraceable transactions, and which is later capable of proving all balances and instruments without storing any transaction history (other than the last signed receipt.) Bitcoin also makes it possible to operate an OT server anonymously (say, on Tor) _and_ at a profit.
OT also implements _separation of powers_ between a transaction server and the currency issuers. Meaning that a currency issuer can issue currencies safely, _without_ operating a transaction server himself. In fact, the same currency might be issued onto dozens of different transaction servers. It is also possible to distribute a single currency across a dozen different issuers (via baskets.)
If you are interested in learning more about OT, I recommend you watch all the videos that are available. There are some 15 or 16 videos now, demonstrating the operation of the test GUI and the command-line utility, and including lots of explanation of what's going on and why.
I can say with some degree of confidence that if you need software that can do the things OT can do, then you will save yourself the most time and trouble by simply using OT to build your software. (Otherwise you will just end up re-inventing the wheel--eventually after years of work you will just end up with something that does the same things OT does, and in the same ways.)

**OT does not pretend to anything more or less than how the Wiki describes it:**
_What is OPEN-TRANSACTIONS?_
* Open-Transactions is an easy-to-use, financial crypto, digital cash and transaction library.
* Open-Transactions includes a client API, a working server, a GUI test wallet (in Java) and a command-line wallet utility.
* Open-Transactions features: a large variety of financial instruments, markets, basket currencies, unforgeable account balances, untraceable digital cash, destruction of account history, Ricardian contracts, Smart Contracts (scriptable clauses), and more.
_WHAT DOES IT DO?_
* Open-Transactions allows users to issue and manipulate digital assets.
* Any issuer can sign and distribute new currency contracts in order to create new digital asset types.
* Users may create many pseudonyms (public keys), each of which may own asset accounts of various types, on OT servers.
* Users can operate “cash-only” (without accounts) for maximum anonymity, using untraceable digital cash.
_FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_
* Users can transfer digital assets securely and provably, with receipts signed by all parties.
* Even an OT server cannot change balances, or forge transactions—since it cannot forge your signature on your receipt.
* Open-Transactions supports a range of financial instruments such as account transfer, cheques and vouchers (aka “cashier’s cheques” or “banker’s cheques”), in addition to cash.
* These instruments are all analogous to the same financial instruments that we all use at normal banks today. Everyone already has an intuitive understanding of these financial instruments, because we use them regularly in our normal daily lives.
_MARKETS, BASKET CURRENCIES, and SMART CONTRACTS_
* Open-Transactions also implements higher-level, contract-based transactions such as payment plans and markets with trades.
* The markets on Open-Transactions support market orders, limit orders, fill-or-kill orders, day orders, stop orders, and stop limits, just like trading on a real market.
* Basket currencies are also supported, as well as payment plans (recurring payments.)
* Smart Contracts: Multi-party agreements with scriptable clauses… including hooks, callbacks, internal state, etc.
* Client-side scripting:  ot  (The entire (mostly) high and low level OT API is available within your scripts.)
_TRIPLE SIGNED RECEIPTS_
* All of this is accomplished in such a way that all parties are able to prove, at all times, which transactions have cleared and which instruments are authorized, without having to store their entire transaction history, but instead by merely keeping the last signed receipt.
* Without the special mechanism that makes this possible, all parties would otherwise be forced to store all receipts forever.
Nyms and Asset Types have consistent IDs across all OT servers, since the ID is formed by hashing the relevant contract or public key.
_IS Open-Transactions CENTRALIZED?_
The vision is not of a central server that you must trust.
Rather, the vision is of federated servers you don’t have to trust.


OT does not include or require a DHT or blockchain, although there are various plans to exploit such technologies in the future, based on needs going forward.


No. As you saw when reading  the protocol makes it impossible for the server to forge any of your balances or transactions. Also, the relevant account information is stored on the client side, so nothing can be lost even if the server disappears.
One potential vulnerability is that the server could use a dummy account to inflate the currency. However, this action cannot escape an audit. Issuers must have an auditing protocol in place with any server operators where their currency is issued. (This problem is irrelevant for issuers who operate their own transaction servers.) The auditing protocol can be as simple as a bash script which adds up the total balance for all accounts of a certain asset type.


Is that supposed to be a loaded question, or is it more indicative of your general temperament?
The usefulness of a server is dependent upon what you are trying to do.
For example, Chaumian blinding requires a server, and it makes possible untraceable cash. So if you want to have untraceable cash, you need to use a server. If you operate the server on Tor, and if OT is used in cash-only mode, then you have fully-anonymous and untraceable cash (as shown in this diagram  But if you don't care about having _fully-anonymous and untraceable cash,_ then the OT cash functionality will be **"totally useless"** to you. But people in the Bitcoin community would not be building blind mixers unless they had need for them. With OT I give them a standard and easy way, to save them from having to re-invent the wheel.
Another example: OT enables off-blockchain transactions, which are _faster, cheaper, and less wasteful_ than on-blockchain transactions. You might say that this introduces counter-party risk _("Who will act as the issuer?")_ but I have proposed to use multi-sig for storing these reserve funds. You might say that MtGox already offers this functionality, to which I would agree: the whole purpose of OT is to make it easier for others to do the same, and in a more trustworthy manner (so that your balance cannot be changed by the server operator, for example.) If you have no need of such functionality, then OT would be **totally useless** to you, but I would note that people in the Bitcoin community would not be building such servers if they did not have a need for them.
Another example: OT enables the use of many of the standard financial instruments that people today take for granted. Instruments like cash, cheques, and cashier's cheques. These instruments all have different properties and uses. People in the Bitcoin community are already building services to layer such instruments (for example, I believe MtGox has vouchers, as does Silk Road.) I believe that these people would not be building such instrumentation layers on top of Bitcoin unless they had a need for them. OT provides a more secure and more easy way for developers to add such layers into their own projects, so that they don't have to re-invent the wheel.
P.S. I should add, that the things described herein are not just things I propose to do, but they already implemented and working.

I welcome criticism as it's good for the software, and also it uncovers the sharpest questions, allowing me the opportunity to propagandize the software through my answers. This is the same reason for open-sourcing it: to harness the open-source community.


Feel free to continue chipping away until every detail is clear. Also, there is the source code, and the wiki, and the instructional videos, and the sample scripts, and the demo server, and the java test GUI, and the command-line tool.


This is the purpose for which it was originally written. I hear there are 400 different currencies issued on Loom. (Another transaction server, similar to OT in some ways but not in others.  )




Perhaps this will clarify things:  **It is physically impossible not to have to trust the issuer, since he is holding your physical gold.** There _must_ be a human auditing procedure in place, with security procedures and separation of powers, where actual gold bars are counted and assayed. Therefore you must always trust the issuer -- this is why there are Ricardian contracts in OT.
The problem OT seeks to solve is this: given that the issuer must be trusted for most asset types, how can we eliminate the necessity of additionally trusting the transaction server? If we can reduce things to where the issuer is the only trusted entity, then we can have transaction servers operating as separate entities, in separate jurisdictions. We can have hundreds of currencies on a single server. We can also have the same currency issued across dozens of different servers. We wouldn't care if one server went down (the way, for example, people cared when Napster went down.)


Yes my point exactly as well. MtGox has the power to change your balance on a whim. Whereas the OT server cannot change your balance unless you initiate it and sign it.
Why the difference? Because MtGox is a **trusted third party,** whereas the OT server is merely a **cloud commodity.** In OT it's the _issuer_ you have to trust -- OT is a transaction server that aims to off-load any trust issues onto the users and issuers themselves, not on the transaction server operator. This makes it cheaper to operate transaction servers.
In OT, the server operates in this "low trust" fashion, and shifts most of the vulnerability to the issuer, where it is physically impossible to avoid it anyway -- for audits of any physical goods.
The only special exception to this is Bitcoin, which can be publicly audited and which has no physical presence. Due to its intrinsic properties, Bitcoin is valued and traded, and thus I expect that it will be traded against other currencies that transact on OT servers. This makes Bitcoin useful to me because I can convert other currencies in/out of it, and then use Bitcoin as a "universal glue" for transferring _any_ asset type between _any_ entities on the Internet.
Bitcoin is also very useful to OT because it enables OT servers to operate anonymously on Tor _at a profit._ You could say that Bitcoin enables OT in the same way that Bitcoin enabled Silk Road. **People will use Bitcoin for moving their gold, the same way they use Bitcoin for moving their drugs.**
Another useful property of Bitcoin: it allows us to greatly reduce any need to trust the issuer. (And it's the only asset type on OT which is capable of doing this.) This is because Bitcoins being bailed onto an OT server need not be transferred to any one issuer, but instead can be transferred to a voting pool (on the blockchain) via the multisig command in the Bitcoin scripting language. With the transaction server itself being unable to forge receipts, and with no single "issuer" controlling the BTC while they are bailed-in, the need to trust the issuer is not _completely_ eliminated, but it is greatly reduced to the point where an adversary would have to commandeer X-out-of-Y voters' Bitcoin wallets in order to steal any of those coins. Meanwhile the money, while traded inside OT, has access to the utility of instruments, markets, smart contracts, and untraceable cash. Being backed in Bitcoin, it is also almost entirely (but not completely) censorship-resistant. 
So I would say that the _greatest_ promise with OT is with the Bitcoin asset, because it very nearly _does_ eliminate the need to trust anyone. Not entirely, of course, but certainly much better than with assets like gold or silver, where physical audits must take place.

Hi, I am the author, I can answer this question.
In only the most recent iterations, we have finally added scripting to OT.
You are able to write client-side scripts, and you are also able to write server-side scripts (called smart contracts) which can be activated and process over time, according to their rules. (It is also possible to stash money inside the contract itself, and use it this way for escrow.)
You can read more here:  
I am still working on a high-level interface in the script language itself, to make it easier for everyone to use, so haven't had a chance yet to post a big example, but there's at least one working smart contract now (two-way trade) and I will be making an escrow contract next.  Probably around that time I will post a video and there will start to be more chatter about the escrow and other scriptable contracts possible using OT.
@_date: 2012-12-02 05:51:28


P.S. I just noticed that you seem to think of OT as a competing technology to Bitcoin. If so, you are looking at it all wrong. However, if you want a brief list of the things that OT can do well, which Bitcoin cannot do well, here's an incomplete list off the top of my head:
* Fully-anonymous and untraceable transactions.
* Transactions with no need to store any transaction history.
* Instantaneous transactions.
* Off-blockchain transactions.
* Ability to send a payment to someone who has not yet installed any client software.
* A wide variety of payment instruments (cash, cheques, cashier's cheques, and account transfer, etc.)
* Ability to issue currencies based on real-world physical assets.
I think you will find, once you do your research, that Bitcoin and OT work quite well together -- and that colored coins and OT also work quite well together. If you have any questions, I encourage you to drop by the opentransactions IRC channel on freenode and there are plenty of people there who can enlighten you.

Bitcoin is "deflationary" because the number of coins cannot exceed 21 million. Therefore I have an incentive to hold onto the coins instead of spending them, because they will be worth more tomorrow than they are today.
Of course the same is true of "inflationary" currencies. If I stick my money in the bank, it will earn more interest for me tomorrow, versus just spending it today. Therefore I have the exact same incentive not to spend it today, but to save it instead.
Therefore the incentive is the same between inflationary and deflationary currencies, is it not? The only difference is, with a deflationary currency, the extra wealth goes to me, the holder. Whereas with an inflationary currency, the wealth goes to whomever is being bailed out by the central bank.

Please point me to an implementation of Chaumian blinding which does not use a server?
Please tell me why MtGox uses a server?
Why did GLBSE use a server? Why were people unable to transact their shares after that server went down?
Why does Tor use servers--aren't servers evil?
Why do remailers use servers?


The purpose of Bitcoin was to create a censorship-resistant currency.
This is why we give up instant transactions on Bitcoin, and this is why we give up the ability to use various financial instruments, and this is why we subject ourselves to being publicly-audited by virtue of the blockchain: because we gain censorship-resistance in return. OT is not meant to replace this functionality. Wherever I need censorship resistance, I will most likely be integrating with Bitcoin and Namecoin, etc.
The things we give up, in order to use Bitcoin (to gain censorship-resistance in return) are actually fine to give up, since we can just add them at higher layers using tools like OT. Then we can have it all. 


Chaum's algorithm enables you to reveal the identity of a double-spender.
However, I am opposed to this functionality. The Wagner algorithm (which I'm using...) **does not enable you to reveal the identity of a double-spender.** A piece of cash can be spent once--after that the server will reject that piece of cash. If the server accepts it twice (which is has no reason to do) then it will fail its audit with the issuer and then all the issuers using that server will dump it, re-issuing their currencies elsewhere.




I have been quite vocal for years that the issuer must be trusted.
Why else have currency contracts at all?
The point of OT is not to eliminate the need to trust the issuer -- the point of OT is to eliminate the need of the user to trust the transaction server, and to eliminate the ability of a transaction server to defraud an issuer -- thus enabling issuers to operate as separate entities from transaction servers, and enabling users to take their receipts directly back to the issuer in the event that the transaction server disappears or gets fired.

The solution is to only sell BTC via credit card to customers who you have on file, with photocopy of their ID and their signature on a written agreement--a standard one that you keep on file for each customer.
I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice, but this is my own business practice and advice.
**The written agreement must state that they are purchasing a valuable and liquid asset, and that they understand that no refunds are possible unless that asset is also returned. Any return must be accompanied by proof of the transfer of the BTC back to you, and only to a BTC address that you will provide in advance, at the time of their return request.**
Keep all of the written agreements on file, and do not send BTC to any customers, above a certain dollar value, who refuse to sign and fax back the written agreement.
Anytime a chargeback is filed, you simply look up the written agreement from your files, and fax it to the credit card company.
You will win every chargeback.
@_date: 2012-02-03 08:34:08
The critical frame:  You *do* offer refunds, but the customer MUST *return* the product first, it must be within X days from the original purchase, and he can only return the BTC to an address that *you* specify. You can give him this special "return address" at the time of his original purchase (assign one to each customer), and you can repeat this address back to him if he ever requests a refund.
**What will happen in practice is, he will not request a return/refund, but will simply file a chargeback. When he does, you can send the CC dispute resolution dept. a copy of his signature on the refund terms. He will lose the chargeback unless he can produce proof that he requested a return, and that he sent the BTCs back to the address you specified.**
In practice what will happen is, the money will disappear from your account temporarily while the dispute is investigated, and then you will get the money back again.

Of course the market is "all sewn up vertically" in the USA, as Assange said. No one here has ever seen an actual free market. The natural equilibrium of things is for the large corporations who write the legislation, and for the regulatory agencies who regulate the large corporations, to eventually merge and become one. The grossest example of this is the banking cartel, which has gained monopoly control over money and debt issuance.
The government was originally designed to provide fair representation both to the States and to the People. Both have been subverted, to the point where fair representation is no longer to be had for either. This is why corporations, public employees unions, and other special interests have hijacked our legislative process and why the political system has become subject to corruption.
IMO: Government action should be focused on preventing and prosecuting rights violations. Many current functions of government should be entirely eliminated. The proper forum is often society, not government.


I believe that better access to free money would benefit me. I also want better access to free (or cheap) quality education and health care, and retirement, and cooler jobs with higher pay. I also want a better computer, a new car, better clothes, and free food.
I also believe that I should not be able to use coercion against others, and likewise everyone else should also adhere to the Non-Aggression Principle in their dealings with myself and others. Do you agree?
Economics IMO is mostly a science of how to lie to people and steal from them, and serves as propaganda for a monopoly cartel. And if that's not true, then can we agree that coercion should no longer be used to prop up said monopoly cartel?

Bitcoin is cash. Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of a cashless society. (The same as do gold, silver, vodka, cigarettes, Tide detergent, etc. You can never actually have a cashless society, it's impossible.)
If a bank cannot trace paper cash, then they should not accept paper cash, at least, in order to be consistent with this current Bitcoin decision coming out of Australia. Whereas if they would would only demand to know the source of the cash, then that should be applied consistently whether it's Bitcoin or paper.

If you want to beat a chargeback, then make your users open accounts with you before processing Bitcoins for them.
As part of that process (opening an account with you) you must require all credit card users to sign an agreement (that you will provide) that they are responsible for the cost of any Bitcoins you sell to them, and that to arrange a refund, they must ask you in advance for a Bitcoin address for them to return the funds to, and they must send the funds to that address.
If the customer cannot prove they sent the funds back to an address that YOU have specified for the one-time use of this refund, then they are not eligible for the refund.
The important thing is having the customer's signature on the above agreement.  When a chargeback is filed, you pull out the paper with the customer's signature, and you send it in as part of the chargeback process -- and you win.
If you aren't following the above protocol, then as a merchant you deserve to lose your money.

On Open-Transactions, the server cannot change your balance, or forge any of your transactions, without your signature. (You sign your request, then the server countersigns it as your receipt. **Since the server cannot forge your signature, the server cannot falsify any of your receipts**.) This means even hackers who break into the server also cannot do these things.
Since your balance is whatever appears on the last signed receipt, **you can always prove your current balance** to the issuer by producing your last receipt. (Even if the transaction server disappears, you still have your last receipt and the issuer still has your gold.)
Since your last receipt contains a list of the valid transaction  that are signed out to you, **you can always prove which instruments are valid** by producing your last signed receipt. Even if a hacker breaks into the server, **the hacker cannot actually change your balance or forge any of your transactions**.  (This is entirely different than all the other centralized servers in the Bitcoin world.)
If the transaction server disappears, you still have your receipt, and you can still have the issuer re-issue your funds onto another transaction server.
Further explanation here:
In the case of Bitcoin, I have proposed a solution to make sure that your Bitcoins cannot be stolen by any server, or any hacker who gains access to said server. **In fact, your Bitcoins would even be recoverable in the event that the server disappears entirely.**
You can read about that solution here:

In the case of gold, your scenario is possible. No matter how good the software is on the transaction server, you still have to trust the guy who is physically holding your gold, aka the Issuer. (At least with OT, you've got a receipt to prove it.) Jurisdiction plays in here as well. I've also tried to mitigate these risks on OT by adding basket currencies, which can be used by insurers.
In the case of Bitcoin, however, my proposed solution (the last link above) solves your scenario through the use of voting pools on the Bitcoin blockchain.

My own project (Open-Transactions) is meant for someday being able to solve issues of resource allocation on anonymous and mesh networks: 
A note from:
Integrated with an anonymous network, Open Transactions solves problems of resource allocation. College kids will leave their computers running all day while they're in class, so that anonymous file-sharing can occur through their computer while they're away (collecting digital cash postage in return.) When they get home, the postage is theirs to keep -- or they can use it to pay for their own downloads. Voila! Anonymous networks can now be drastically sped-up through the anonymous contribution of resources. If you don't want to contribute computing resources, that's fine: just pay for those resources with anonymous digital cash instead, and the network will provide you those resources from someone else.
The above is true for MESH NETWORKS as well. Imagine Mesh routers popping up like mushrooms, the same way that ATM machines pop up today. Instead of paying your ISP for network resources (with a credit card), rather, pay your PEERS of network resources using digital cash (backed in Bitcoin...)

Here's an idea I had for incorporating the Bitcoin script language to form voting pools for Bitcoin storage, so that coins bailed into an Open-Transactions server would be recoverable in the event that the server disappeared, and would also be impervious to hacking attacks on that server:

I can't morally bring myself to operate a porn site, otherwise I would definitely pursue the opportunities inherent in uncensorable / untraceable digital currencies for porn and gambling sites.
I think they haven't done it yet because the big operators are already pulling in huge piles of cash, so they are focused on the normal day-to-day business, and enjoying their lives.
I think it will take a new operator to come in, to take advantage of the new possibilities in Bitcoin and carve out a space for himself. If a new currency gives some kind of new advantage, then he will benefit from that advantage regardless of what the other industry players are doing. THEN other people will start jumping on board when they see him benefiting.  THEN maybe the big operators will get involved. (Or get shunted off to the side by the new top dogs.)

If you  use an account on OT, then the server can see whenever you deposit or withdraw cash, and the server can see your current balance. But it cannot trace who gave you that cash, and it will not be able to trace wherever you spend it, because the Chaumian Blinding makes the cash untraceable.
You can also use OT without an account (cash-only) which is comparable to going cash-only in real life (no account at any bank.) In that case, however, the server can still see your IP address that you are connecting from.
Therefore, for full anonymity, you must connect over Tor or I2P. At that point, your IP address is hidden, your cash exchanges aren't tied to any account because you aren't using an account, and the spending of the cash is already fully untraceable. Add it all up together and you have full anonymity.

I have run online businesses and grossed millions of dollars over the years, and most people pay with credit cards.  Chargebacks are part of doing business, and you win some and lose some, and learn your lessons along the way. I would *not* say it is untested. I would say that the chargeback process is very well-defined, and if you have your paperwork in order, you will win.
Just make sure you have the refund process clearly described in the agreement.  The customer can print it out, sign it, and fax it in -- with or without a photocopy of his ID, if you want to also check the signature and have even more deterrent effect against scammers.
When you send in that signed agreement, you will win the chargeback.
(As long as the terms are clearly laid out, and the customer has failed to meet those terms.)

I supposedly have an incentive to hold onto a deflationary currency, such as gold or Bitcoins, since the value of the currency increases over time, relative to real goods. (Saving the gold is more profitable than spending it.)
**However if this is true, then it is equally true of inflationary currencies.** For example, the dollar is clearly inflationary, but if I save it in a CD or some similar instrument for several years instead of spending it, then I will certainly also earn an additional rate of return.
The incentive is the same. Except, gold is more reliable.

I'll take a stab at it:
OT is a *financial crypto* and *digital cash* library written in C++.
Built with that library there is also a *server*, a *command-line utility*, a *test GUI*, and a *client API* available in many languages (Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Python, etc.)
Anyone can issue a new currency by way of a *Ricardian contract*, and these currencies can be traded on markets. OT's markets allow for limit orders, day orders, fill-or-kill orders, etc, just like trading on a real market. *Basket currencies* are also supported.
Users can open accounts in any asset type, and have access to all the same financial instruments they use today at their bank. (*Cash*, *cheques*, *account-to-account transfer*, banker's cheques aka cashier's cheques, *recurring payments*, etc.)
Users can also use OT **cash-only (without an account)**, which enables **full-anonymity** as long as you connect over Tor or I2P. This is possible because the cash on OT is *untraceable*. (OT uses *Chaumian Blinding* aka **untraceable digital cash**.)
Due to the design of the core transaction system, *it is impossible on OT for any server to change your balance, or to forge any transaction, without your signature.* (This is because your "balance" is whatever appears on your last signed receipt, and the server cannot forge your signature on the receipt.)
OT implements *"destruction of account history"* which means that all parties can prove their balances, and prove which instruments are valid, without keeping their entire transaction history, but instead by only keeping the *last signed receipt*.
The ultimate vision is one of p2p clients and federated servers, with voting pools and auditing protocols for safe storage of Bitcoins on low-trust servers. (We'll get there. Read more on this concept:   )
 
There's a video walkthru link available on the OT wiki, as well as a radio interview and plenty of diagrams and articles:

So technically, OT isn't "usable" by *anyone* (except a programmer.)
However, someday soon there will be easy user interfaces written by such programmers, and those applications *will* be accessible to average people. (The same as there are applications out there which use OpenSSL--another crypto library--even though their users will probably never be able to directly program to OpenSSL itself.)
Here's what a user-oriented application will probably look like (see the window on the left side):  
Keep in mind, however, that many different applications are possible with this library, not just the typical "digital wallet" software.

Answer: because the cash instrument is untraceable, through the use of Chaumian Blinding. So as long as you connect through an anonymous network such as Tor, the use of digital cash through OT becomes completely anonymous. Also, even if you don't connect over Tor, the cash itself is still untraceable. (So while the server can see you made a withdrawal, it has no way of tracing how that cash is spent.)

-- You will be able to transact in Bitcoin (or gold, or anything else) untraceably and with full anonymity. This will make it possible for, for example, bloggers in China or Syria to operate in relative safety. (In the past week, a Syrian blogger was murdered by a sniper for reporting on events in his town, and a Chinese blogger was sentenced to ten years in prison.) This is made possible because people will be able to offer server hosting services such as blog hosting, and also people will be able to purchase such services, anonymously. Combined with the existing anonymous networks such as I2P, we should be able to protect all of these bloggers and their freedoms of thought and expression. 
-- You will have instant finality of settlement (instead of waiting 10 minutes to an hour for a transaction to clear.) This is a lot more useful to merchants and customers. ("Check back in 10 minutes" isn't the most preferable shopping cart process.)
-- Microtransactions will be more feasible than they would be on the blockchain. Also, cash streaming protocols, which will probably enable the future MeshNet that is coming, (if people desire freedom enough to make it real.) Cash protocols have the potential to cause such a network to grow like an organism. Wireless mesh routers will pop up like mushrooms, the same as ATMs do today.
-- On OT, unlike most other systems, and unlike the blockchain, you will be able to prove which instruments are valid, and which transactions are cleared, *without* storing any transaction history, as long as you keep your last signed receipt. This is useful to all parties, and also reduces the cost of running a transaction server.
-- OT supports a full gamut of financial instruments, including cheques, transfers, cash, cashier's cheques, receipts, recurring payments, market offers and trades, and smart contracts (scriptable clauses -- write your own.) You will have to decide for yourself how to best use these capabilities; OT was written as a library because I could not possibly imagine everything by my lonesome.
-- You could use OT to write a market exchange. Of course there are market exchanges already, but I'm just saying.
-- You could use OT to write an online wallet, or a personal wallet. Of course, such things exist already, but I'm just saying.
-- OT now supports client-side scripting also, meaning that people can combine "unix scripting" with "financial transactions". The possibilities are endless, but that part is really up to all of you.
-- You could use OT to build a digital ticketing system, printing out tickets with QR codes or whatever.
-- You could use OT to offer escrow services.
-- You could use OT to build a full financial transaction system into an online game or virtual universe. (Gold duplication can get to be a real issue on games.) People on the game would be able to open accounts, withdraw and deposit cash, write cheques, trade on markets, just like people in real life. People would even be able to issue their own currencies, and trade in basket currencies.  
At some point OT will also support Ripple (payments following a path p2p, routed across credit lines that individuals extend to each other in multiple currencies.) The potential here is that banks and exchangers will no longer be able to act as "gatekeepers" to the financial system, since people will be able to settle up with those who they know already, offline, in any currency they wish.
At some point OT will support Bitcoin voting pools, meaning it would be impossible for any single server to just disappear with your Bitcoins. (A problem currently endemic to the Bitcoin world.) This will be a protocol between OT servers that exploits the new "multi-sign" that is coming out in the new Bitcoin client. (Voting on the blockchain itself.)

Even if that is true (which it probably is), _still:_
* Governments will continue to tax property based on assessed property values.
* Governments will continue taxing retail sales.
* Governments will continue taxing imports and exports.
* Governments will continue taxing mineral production (such as oil production, which forms a major part of the budget for many countries.)
* Governments will continue to tax luxury goods.
* Governments will continue to tax gasoline.
* Governments will continue to tax public utilities. (Water, electricity, natural gas, etc.)
And so on. Any government funded through such taxes would be immune to crypto-currencies—and this is exactly how governments have been funded throughout history.
Thus the owners and software developers working for such pure-IP companies will still pay tax just the same as anyone else, even if their company itself is purely digital.

That's right. So then how do we decide if a law is good or bad?
We can't decide based on "because the king says so." Otherwise Kim Jong Un could make murder or kidnapping "good" because he says so. The original purpose for the jury was to protect against this sort of thing.
We can't decide based on "because the democratic majority says so" because that is what happened in WWII Germany. Once again, murder or kidnapping becomes perfectly legal in that case.
The best objective standard is if there is a crime of fraud or aggression with a victim. In fact that is the origin of our legal system, which pre-dates legislatures. Any other law is clearly a bad law. Does that mean America is Nazi Germany? Of course not. But it's just to illustrate the political principle. And things are definitely getting worse, not better.

Fiat currency is thus-called because it derives its "value" by government edict. A small number of powerful people use violence to prop up their currency, so that they can inflate it and thereby derive ill-gotten gains. (Violence such as tax "laws", capital gains "laws", money laundering "laws", legal tender "laws", etc.)
Whereas sound money becomes currency as a result of natural market forces, due to its unique properties. For example, gold (and Bitcoin) are divisible, fungible, value-dense (scarce), recognizable, international, difficult or impossible to counterfeit, durable, etc.
So, no, Bitcoin isn't fiat -- it's sound money. And it is being adopted by the invisible hand of the market as a result of its unique properties.

Here's my commit history:

-- Your "balance" is just whatever is on your last receipt.
-- The client signs the receipt first, and the server only counter-signs (notarizes) it after the fact.
-- Therefore the server can never forge your receipt, or change your balance.


This is absolutely correct -- if you use a trusted issuer (which you can) then you still have the real-world consideration of auditing the physical gold itself.
HOWEVER, if the asset is Bitcoin, then it can be stored in a multi-sig voting pool, where the reserves are publicly auditable, and where no issuer is necessary, and where the OT server cannot steal those coins.
FURTHERMORE, those pool-based BTC can be used for the posting of surety bonds, used as reserve backing for real-world currencies (gold, dollars, etc).
See the article "Lex Cryptographia" for more details.

I'm sure if you stop in the IRC channel, they will fix it for you pretty quick. Here I'm just guessing: I would say you probably didn't select the right folder (where the DLL is) and if you DID select the right folder, then you probably still need to install the install prog. (I think you have to install both 32 and 64 bit versions, for example.)
This won't matter once we have a full Windows install prog because it will handle all that automatically. But until then you do have to install at least two things, and I assume you haven't yet, or you are choosing the wrong folder. (If it's successful loading up the DLL, then when you click "OK" it will pop up the Moneychanger window.)
Also I suggest you start up the test server on your machine (otserver.exe) and use it with the test data to get started playing with it. This way, the GUI will have a server it can immediately connect with and you can play around with creating accounts and doing market trades.  (There are real servers out there, but if you are just getting started, it's fun to play with the test server which you can run locally.)

(They require a notarized document to get signed up as a customer.)
You wouldn't have to do this for every credit card purchase. Rather, you would do it **once** while setting up as a new customer. (Which would also put your BTC address on file.)
From there, you could do many credit card transactions, with the purchased coins sent to your same address every time.

Neither gold nor Bitcoin have any "intrinsic" value. Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties. As a result, they naturally become selected as currency by market forces, in a free market.
The only reason you have seen gold supplanted by dollars is because of the artificial forces that must be in play (government violence) in order to continually prop up the dollars and suppress the gold.
Since Bitcoin is immune to those artificial forces, it is able to succeed in a perverted marketplace where gold has been suppressed.

If Bitcoin is deflationary, that means people are more likely to "hoard" them instead of spending them! Oh no!!!!! Because they earn more by holding the coins, they are incentivized to hold them.
**Dollars are exactly the same way.** If you put your dollars into savings bonds, instead of spending them, then you will have more dollars tomorrow as a result. _Therefore you have the same incentive to hold dollars as with bitcoins._
Therefore dollars are deflationary.

Let me first say that I like the Ripple project, and I am the first one in the bleachers rooting for all similar projects, that their technologies prove out, and that they are successful. (Just to make it clear that I'm not being "unfair" to anyone.)
All of us are here because we are striving for monetary freedom, and everyone is solving different problems. There were $640 quadrillion in payments last year, and the world of finance is ripe for disruption!
That having been said, the two systems (OT and Ripple) really are quite different -- different enough that it would only create _more_ confusion, IMO, not less, to describe them as anything other than apples and oranges. They really solve different problems, and they use different concepts to do it.
You are correct that there is _some_ overlap in function, but less than you might think -- For example, OT doesn't doesn't do things the way that Ripple does (issue credit lines or use consensus, etc.) Ripple, likewise, doesn't do most of the things that OT was built to do. (Destruction of account history, untraceable cash, un-hackable BTC storage, full range of financial instruments, etc)
I'm not making a value-judgment (in fact I'm a big fan of Ripple) but I'm saying that the two systems solve different problems; their goals and their implementations are quite different.
There very well may be new inventions coming which incorporate both systems -- all of you out there will have to figure that out yourselves :-)

You have admitted that there are no victims, there is no fraud, and no violence.
You claim that "some things" are crimes because of potential harm or tangential harm, but you do not apply this to Ulbricht's situation in any way.
How is any harm perpetrated by providing a forum for purely voluntary transactions? In fact it is well known that Silk Road _reduced_ harm:
It seems you are fine with the government sticking Ulbricht in a cage, however, even though you are unable to justify it. And legislation is not enough of a justification -- if it was, it would have been a viable defense at Nuremberg.

I could really use this since I am adding corporations to OT. (You can already issue stocks and pay dividends, but we don't have votes yet for decision-making.)
I could see using a multi-sig operation, where each party inside OT to is authorized to vote (say, the board of directors) has to register the appropriate Bitcoin address. Then decisions by the board are decided by some kind of vote (on the blockchain) of those bitcoin addresses.
If you want to be able to hide the contents of the vote, you have to use homomorphic cryptography. This enables us to count the votes without revealing them.
David Chaum has worked on voting systems that use homomorphic crypto, you should be able to find it on Google.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, this strategy is actually well-tested for online e-product sales and seminars. I'm just adapting it to Bitcoins here instead.
**I'm curious to hear comments on this because I think I have it figured out pretty solid...**
First -- if you turn on specific security features (in your CC merchant account) then the customers can't just claim they never made the purchase... chargeback requirements become more stringent on their end.
Second -- You have to get the customer's signature on a signed customer contract up front (before any purchases) stating the terms of the refund policy. This contract must include a BTC address (listed on the contract) where all BTC purchases are sent for that customer. **Make the customer get this notarized so he can't claim identity theft.**
(This way a hacker cannot later just hack your account and send your BTC to his own address -- coins can _only_ be sent to the address the customer used when he originally signed the customer contract. **This way the customer can't claim he never got the coins....)**
The refund terms in the contract must state that for any BTC purchases, BTCs are sent to the customer's BTC address, which is a provable event, and **any refund is only payable if those coins are returned** (i.e. if they don't return the coins, then they aren't eligible for the refund.)
The refund terms also need to require the customer to request a refund in writing, so that the merchant can send the customer a 1-time-only BTC address for the "returned product" to be sent to. The refund terms must require the return of product (the coins) is only considered a valid return if sent to that specific 1-time BTC address. **This way the merchant can prove for certain whether or not the product (BTC) was actually returned to the merchant.**
The refund terms also need a few restrictions like, refunds must be requested within X days, and also the customer understands the market price fluctuates, and the refund amount will be the same as the purchase amount, MINUS any drop in market price, and MINUS an X% restocking fee.
Also, the refund terms must require the refund to be sent in writing, notarized, and by registered mail. **This way the user cannot claim you ignored his refund request,** since he has to send you a registered mail in order to make the request. (So he should therefore have a receipt of delivery from doing this.)
The refund terms should also state that any actual refund will be sent by cheque, by registered mail, 6-8 weeks after processing, made out to the customer's name, and this cheque can only be mailed to the mailing address listed on the original signed customer contract. (This means that the customer can never be eligible to receive the funds directly back onto the card itself.) This also prevents anyone but the original customer from getting the refund money, since the cheque is made out to the customer, and so only he can go into a bank and deposit it.
These steps legitimately are intended to prevent fraud, but this means they also prevent successful chargebacks, by proving definitively whether or not fraud actually occurred, and by proving definitively whether or not the customer actually followed the terms of the refund policy he agreed to.
Customers must request a refund according to the terms in their customer contract, meaning they have to return the Bitcoins first before they qualify for any refund. (And merchants can prove the coins were sent to that customer when originally purchased.)
When the chargeback notice turns up, the merchant has an opportunity to reply. At this time, fax the customer contract to the CC company, along with the proof that the BTC were actually sent to the same BTC address listed in that customer contract. Point out that the refund terms require the customer to **return the product in order to be eligible for any refund.** Offer to perform the refund (according to terms) once the BTC are actually returned.
At this point the customer should lose the chargeback (every time.) If the customer didn't request a refund, then they will lose the chargeback, since that proves that they also didn't return the product, since the return address is only obtained by first making a refund request. But if instead the customer DID request a refund (obtaining a return address to send the returned product to) then the merchant can prove definitively whether or not the product was actually returned to that address.
Customers also should never need to actually chargeback, since they should just follow the refund policy instead. So the fact they are charging back in the first place means they didn't follow the refund policy, which is provable, and which causes them to lose the chargeback.
The basic proof you will fax to the CC company will be:
1. The signed, notarized customer contract, containing the customer's BTC address for receiving purchased coins.
2. Blockchain proof that the merchant sent coins to the same BTC address on the customer contract.
3. A statement that the customer never requested a refund, or if he did, he never returned the product. (In which case, also include blockchain proof that the merchant's 1-time BTC return address never received any returned product.)
The basic strategy here is that if there is a solid refund policy, customers must obtain a refund through that policy, and not through a chargeback. If the customer fulfills the refund terms, then the merchant has nothing to lose and can actually grant the refund no problem. But if the customer fails to fulfill the refund terms (which is the only case where the merchant stands to lose) then the customer is ineligible for a refund anyway, and will lose the chargeback for failure to follow the terms.
As I said, this strategy is very-well-tested elsewhere (for other sales not related to Bitcoins) but I don't see why it couldn't be adapted to use with Bitcoins. It definitely works elsewhere.
An additional option could be that some sort of deposit is required to sign up as a customer, which is fully-refundable, say $500 or whatever, which is forfeit in the event that the customer files a chargeback without going through the proper refund process.

Just wanted to clear up some things...


Actually it is more our _Bitmessage_ integration that will provide the decentralization (by enabling discovery for decentralized exchange.)
The purpose of colored coins is different: For fiat currencies, it allows us to separate the issuer from the transaction server, such that one doesn't need to be aware of the existence of the other. Technically speaking, the decentralized exchange would work with-or-without this feature.


This is incorrect also. If you don't want to trust your coins to the server operator, the solution is to store those coins in a _multi-sig voting pool._ This wouldn't provide decentralized exchange, but it _would_ provide for safe storage of the coins.
We are working on this but for the record it's not available yet.


Are you sure the UI sucks? I invite you to check out these videos:
introduction: 
advanced: 
We are also working on a desktop version of this UI, would you can view here:


Colored coins are for fiat currencies (such as dollars or euros.)
For conventional Bitcoins, ideally those would be stored in a multi-sig voting pool, so that any individual server is unable to steal them.
For fiat currencies, ideally those would be issued as colored coins, and then those could also be safely stored in a multi-sig voting pool. (But fiat currencies would also be do-able without using colored coins.)

Here are instructions for installing OT on Linux using apt-get: 
Here are instructions for installing OT on Windows (there are a few install programs):  
I'm sorry it's not all in a single install program yet, but it will be soon. It's an open-source project, so the creation of such things is partially up to the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. The above steps, however, are quite close already to that reality.
Here's some info on how to play with it, once you have it installed: 


This is actually not true -- Moneychanger is a Java **client,** which uses the **OT client API** (which you can install using the above instructions.)
Thus: There is no need to have the OT server installed, in order to use the OT client. But FYI the server is just an exe, and the client is just a DLL (which Moneychanger uses.)


I don't think you should have these sorts of problems if you follow the above instructions.


It's pretty easy now to install, and it's getting easier everyday. I suggest you wait a while if it's not easy enough for you yet -- it will be soon enough. Trust me, there are many early adopters. The early bird gets the worm.


OT is not the same as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a p2p protocol implementing a digital commodity.
OT is a financial cryptography library. You could write all kinds of different software using OT, just as you can write all kinds of software using OpenSSL. You have to look at it as a library, not as a Bitcoin client.
You can use OT for issuing BTC-based currency contracts and financial instruments, but you could just as easily use OT for issuing gold-based currency contracts and financial instruments. OT is agnostic to the reserve backing.
The people who should be looking at OT right now are software developers, not end-users. (Not yet, anyway.)


Moneychanger is written 100% in Java. 
Moneychanger uses the OT client API, which thus makes calls into libOTAPI.DLL. 
The DLL is Open-Transactions, written in C++: 
(They are two separate projects, otherwise.) While the DLL is written in C++, the Java code calls it just the same as calling any other imported Java library (many of which are also written in C++...) This same DLL is available for other languages to call (Python, PHP, etc) I guess you could re-write the entire OT library in Java if you wanted to, but I don't see why that's necessary since the Java test GUI (Moneychanger) already calls the C++ DLL just fine.
Lemme know if you have any other problems -- I recommend you get on the IRC channel for support.

FYI the Bitcoin board is probably not the best place for tech support questions regarding Open-Transactions.
I suggest you go to the IRC channel  (at freenode).
I also suggest the official OT forum at 
Here is the answer to your question:
Moneychanger is only a test GUI (written in Java) to provide a GUI for Open-Transactions. The GUI will not work unless you have first installed or built Open-Transactions itself. This will create some shared libraries which are then loaded up by the GUI.
So in your case, you probably don't have Open-Transactions itself. The Java GUI is asking you where the OT libraries are stored -- if you have not compiled those yet, then you will either have to build them yourself, or find a pre-built package.
I believe da2ce7 has some pre-built versions of OT for Windows, and if you prefer Linux you can probably install OT from here: 
If you want to compile OT yourself, I suggest you download the code and follow the instructions, available here: 
Soon there will be easier ways to use OT -- more commercial quality apps that you will be able to just install with the click of a button. But until then, you have to compile it yourself.

In the case of BTC-based assets it's possible to do this without any trusted third party, by storing the BTC using multi-sig voting pools on the Bitcoin blockchain.
It's also possible to use these BTC-based assets as surety bonds for agents who facilitate moving in/out of other asset types, so you don't have to trust a central entity to store reserves of dollars or gold.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:43:43


Thanks! That's actually a great way of looking at it.


The philosophy of OT is to be agnostic -- to integrate these sorts of things through an abstract interface.
So for example, you could use a traditional certificate authority, or namecoin, or invictus, or anything else, and it would just be like another plugin as far as OT is concerned, for the purposes of identity.
The same is true for communication -- bitmessage is our first target for p2p discovery, but we are using an abstract interface, so other methods will work just as well, jabber or whatever.
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:36:26

It's quite similar to physical cash.


See the article on Lex Cryptographia.
Some basic concepts:
* You don't necessarily have to have a central entity who is trusted to store the gold, if you instead create a virtual corporation where the real-world assets are moved in/out through the edge nodes.
* You don't have to trust the edge nodes or worry about their reputation if you have systems in place for the posting of surety bonds and for dispute resolution in smart contracts.
* Surety bonds can be posted in a different asset type than the currency itself. FOR EXAMPLE, you might have a gold-based currency, but with surety bonds for the agents posted in Bitcoin form -- and those Bitcoins can be stored in voting pools where an OT server cannot steal them.

Silver, in the form of electrum (a gold–silver alloy), was coined to produce money around 700 BC by the Lydians. Later, silver was refined and coined in its pure form. Many nations used silver as the basic unit of monetary value. In the modern world, silver bullion has the ISO currency code XAG. 
...In some languages, such as Spanish and Hebrew, the same word means both silver and money.
If you read the Gold article, it is much the same. These two metals have been proven for thousands of years.
By contrast:
According to an interesting study of the 775 fiat currencies that have existed, 599 are no longer in circulation. The median life expectancy for the defunct currencies? Fifteen years. Perhaps the author was being unfair by focusing solely on the failures. Sadly no, the average life expectancy of all fiat currency is running at a truly underwhelming 34 years. Only a select few have managed anything approaching old age. The British pound sterling is one such example at over 300 years and counting. Before we get too excited by this apparent example of longevity, at inception the pound was defined as 12 ounces of silver. The pound is now worth less than 0.5% of this original value and of course there is no silver involved anywhere. In other words, the most successful currency in existence in terms of life-span has lost more than 99% of its value.
 
The study also found that 1 in 5 fiat currencies have failed outright through hyper-inflation - a percentage that I must admit surprised me as I was under the impression that hyperinflation was a much less common occurrence. The following is an excerpt of some of those hyper-inflationary episodes. Full details of each example with precipitating causes can be found here.    
In the USA, the Federal Reserve Bank was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorized currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver.
_"Until recently"_ ...?
The Nixon Shock of 1971 ended the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. Since then all reserve currencies have been fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the Euro.
That's not a very long time, nor a very good history, compared to precious metals, is it?
Why do we only see these great depressions, these hyperinflations, these wild swings, in the 20th century? Historically, what happened? The roaring twenties, the Great Depression, the Weimar inflation, Adolf Hitler, World War II.
Fiat currencies are not selected by natural market forces, as gold and silver (and Bitcoin) are.
Rather, fiat currencies are imposed through legal tender legislation, tax legislation, and incrementalism (the formation of the Federal Reserve and the Income tax in 1913, the gold confiscation in 1933:  and the closing of the gold window in 1971--each event being made inevitable by the preceding one.)
Meanwhile the use of Gold and Silver as money must be actively suppressed through measures such as capital gains taxes.
I should note that the Constitution expressly forbids the states from being able to: _"make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;"_
The Federal government _is_ delegated the responsibility to _"coin money"_ and to _"fix the Standard of Weights and Measures",_ but the power to _"emit bills of credit"_ is _not_ delegated to the federal government, and the state governments are expressly prohibited from doing so!

Most "currency" systems allow you to move dollars into tokens, but they don't allow you to move the tokens back into dollars. (They are "one-way.")
If Amazon allowed you to move back into dollars again, the government could just pressure them to stop doing it. But this is not the same with Bitcoin, which is what makes it different than all the others.
Notice that virtual currency trading sites do not allow withdrawals, due to chargeback risk... unless they support Bitcoin, in which case suddenly they DO allow withdrawals. Bitcoin is an enabler like this in many other areas as well. It makes such things as withdrawals possible, where previously the option just wouldn't have been available.

As I said, the important part is to have proof of fulfillment, in combination with a signed agreement on your refund policy, such that the person is only eligible for a refund if they follow the policy. (Then you just add a line to the policy that they have to return the product in order to qualify for a refund.)
FYI, most chargebacks are not people who were dissatisfied with their purchase. (They may have been very happy with their purchase.) Rather, they are people who changed their mind 3 months later, when rent is due, and they need some money, so they file the chargeback
Some people in this thread have remarked _"well this would reduce the number of scammers"_ -- but no, it's more: it eliminates the _ability_ to scam at all. Most chargebacks are not people who actually followed the refund policy, but rather, they just file the chargeback months later and say, _"not as advertised."_
If, at that time, you are able to produce their signed agreement on a specific refund policy they have _failed to follow,_ especially with regard to a _return of the product they originally received,_ then they _will_ lose that chargeback every single time.
If, on the other hand, they _do_ follow the policy, then they must return the Bitcoins before being eligible for the refund, in which case the merchant, again, has no problem at all.
Either way the merchant wins.
Your own comment about the **VISA TOS is the one that I would be the most worried about** -- the scammers themselves are easy to beat, but the TOS might be another thing entirely. (As I said, I've never sold any virtual currency.)

Sorry, it's an X% RETURN fee. Does that help?
That's the fee that covers your expenses with regards to the original merchant fees, plus the expense of maintaining the mailbox for the returns, plus the expense of paying the employees who check the mailbox and process the returns, and who create the 1-time BTC address used to prove that the return occurred, and who then verify the list of pending returns against the list of addresses in order to authorize accounting to send out a cheque, and also to cover various ancillary office expenses and bills related to your staff and who keep complete filed records of all authorized customers and returns. They are also responsible for forwarding returned BTC from the 1-time addresses to the cold wallet owned by the business.
P.S. don't forget also the expense of providing Obamacare, unemployment insurance, and FICA tax coverage to those employees.
P.P.S. make sure when you send out a cheque, it expires in 30 days so they have to cash it ASAP.
P.P.P.S. Part of the purpose of the return fee is also to discourage returns, since people would normally want to get the best price for their BTC, not the worst. 
P.P.P.P.S. The whole intention of a real scammer is to KEEP the Bitcoin while REFUNDING the credit card. Therefore a real scammer will not want to return the coins AT ALL. The fact that the policy requires him to do so is _why_ you will beat a scammer's chargeback every time. (Whereas a real customer who is not a scammer, will have no intention of refunding, which carries costs, at a potentially lower value than the coin is actually worth, when he could instead sell the BTC directly onto a market at the highest available price, without having to file a chargeback or pay any return fees.)

Why would I be worried that pieces of paper would be seized? Why would I go around burying pieces of paper? The _gold_ was what got seized. The paper you hold in your hands is merely representative of the actual value that was _already_ seized, decades ago.
And whatever value that paper may be redeemable for, decreases every year due to inflation. Even if you bury it in your backyard, that doesn't stop inflation from slowly eating away at it, whether the paper itself is confiscated or not. Debt is the money of slaves.


Regarding Bitcoins and gold, it’s important to keep in mind that neither has “intrinsic” value.
Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.
Gold is:
* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
By comparison:
* Diamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.
* Water, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.
* Food, while valuable, is not durable.
* Dollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)
* Dollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).
* Dollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)
* Food, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.
* Dollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)
Soon it becomes very clear that gold was never “declared” to be a form of money by any “authorities” but rather, became money due to natural market forces.
If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender “laws”, tax “laws”, money laundering “laws”, etc.)
Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.
Now let’s consider Bitcoin’s unique properties:
* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
AS WELL AS:
* Non-confiscatable.
* Accounts cannot be frozen.
* Anonymity is possible.
* Electronically transferrable.
As you can see, Bitcoin’s unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.
Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the government’s collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.


What makes you think you have any representation in government?
The lie they sell you is, _"Everyone has a vote"_ -- but as I said, what matters is how _diluted_ that vote has become.
The House of Representatives was originally meant to represent the people. The Constitution describes a ratio of 30,000 people per representative.
If that were true today, a representative could not get elected unless he lived in your town and operated a business down the street. No amount of TV commercials could change that.
But since Congress froze the size of the House a hundred years ago, your vote has been steadily diluted to the point where there are now 700,000 people per representative. When does it become tyranny, 7 million? 70 million?
Similarly, the Senate was originally meant to represent the states. Each Senator had to answer to 50 or 100 state legislators from his home state, and meet with them, and keep them happy, or he was fired.
But today? Senators are elected by a popular vote. Each Senator in California, for example, faces a direct election by 30 million people. But those Senators do not represent those people, since it is physically impossible to represent 30 million people.
So then who do they represent? Large corporations and public employees unions, who pay for their TV commercials, who meet with them regularly, and who dictate the contents of the legislation that gets passed.
The most they care about voters is every 6 years or so, when they might get a vague feeling that voters are "angry" based on phone calls coming in. But when was the last time you actually met with your "representative"?
**Taxation without representation.**


Did they benefit from having half their money seized by the authorities? Apparently you think they did. But those who held their money in Bitcoin made out very well from that debacle.


Perhaps next time they should think carefully about using the banking system at all, especially now that technological alternatives are making it obsolete.

Deflationary hoarding myth is "true" of dollars, too. The myth basically states that you have an incentive to hoard your money if it is worth more tomorrow than today, thus causing deflation. 
But if this is true, it's true of dollars as well... if you invest dollars into a bank CD (basically stick them in the bank) then they will be worth more tomorrow.
Thus you have an incentive to hoard dollars instead of spending them. Thus dollars are deflationary.

FYI, Open-Transactions includes plenty of payment protocols, and OT credentials can source their identities both from traditional CAs, as well as from **Namecoin addresses.**
I believe **Namecoin** is the proper replacement for CAs.
I don't like to see Bitcoin doing any official integrations with SSL / CAs -- it's not keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy and such things should be done at higher layers anyway.
There's no reason why you can't have all sorts of arcane protocols which use Bitcoin underneath, and tie it to things like CAs and SSL.
_But such protocols, IMO, shouldn't involve changes inside Bitcoin itself._
People will say that this change in Bitcoin "isn't mandatory" but they may not realize that certain authorities may MAKE it legally mandatory for businesses, even when it's not technically mandatory inside the Bitcoin protocol itself. So it's still dangerous. Many recently unveiled NSA-based vulnerabilities in various crypto implementations are based on OPTIONAL algorithms, not mandatory ones.

Campaign donors are NOT constituents!
Consider the House and Senate. The House was originally meant to represent the _people._ The ratio described in the Constitution was 30,000 to 1.
If we had such a ratio today, you would not be able to get elected as my representative unless you lived in my town, went to my church, and operated a business down the street. _No amount of TV commercials could change that._
But today, since Congress froze the size of the House a hundred years ago, that ratio is now 700,000 to 1. **When does it become tyranny, 7 million to 1? 7 billion to 1?**
Similarly, the Senate was originally meant to represent the _states._ A senator actually had to sit down with 50 or 100 state legislators, and listen to their concerns, and keep them happy, or he was fired.
But today? A senator in California is elected by a direct election in a state where there are over 30 million people. But the senator does not _represent_ those people, because _it is physically impossible to represent 30 million people._
So then, whom _do_ they represent? Large corporations and public employees' unions, who pay for their TV commercials, who meet with them regularly, and who dictate the contents of the legislation. But when was the last time _you_ met with your senator?
The most they care about voters is every 6 years or so, when they get a vague feeling that voters are "angry" -- but who cares about them? As long as they keep their campaign donors happy.
The bottom line is that campaign donors have become the effective constituents, only because the people no longer have fair representation in this country. And this means, absent the proper delegation of powers, that those in Washington are now acting without the proper authority.
**Taxation without representation.** 
@_date: 2013-09-01 23:08:28
(Technically a "dollar" is 394 and 1/4 grains of silver.)
The Constitution authorizes the Federal government to coin money, but delegates no power to emit paper money ("bills of credit.") The Federal government is also given the responsibility of setting the standards for "weights and measures."
The States, meanwhile, are expressly forbidden from emitting bills of credit, or from making anything legal tender except for "gold and silver."
Do you believe that government force should continue to be used to compel people to use their monopoly money? Or do you believe there should be a free market in money?
Because as long as people are truly free from coercion, to use whatever money they wish (whether that be dollars, or Bitcoin, or anything else) then this is all a moot point. The only reason we're talking about which money is "better" is because this country is currently in the habit of forcing a specific form of money onto people, in violation of its own Constitution.
Similarly, do you believe that voters have a right to fair representation? If so, then clearly that right is being violated, certainly by any standard that existed when the Constitution was written, and thus we are currently subject to taxation without representation. But if, on the other hand, you believe that "having a vote" is good enough, regardless of whether or not the voters actually have fair representation, then I don't really know what to say in response to that. I suppose in that case I would want to know why you think voting matters at all?
I'm also curious if you believe that the "just powers" of government are "derived from the consent of the people" ?
And if so, I'm wondering if you think it's possible to delegate powers you never had. For example, if you do not have the right to beat and rob people, do you believe it's okay to _hire_ someone to beat and rob people? Can non-existent powers be delegated?

...And of course, it is impossible to delegate powers you don't even have, don't you agree?
For example, if I do not have the right to beat and rob people, then neither do I have the right to hire bodyguards to beat and rob people. Neither do we have the right to elect a sheriff to beat and rob people -- _even if we voted for him to do so._
**Because you cannot delegate powers you didn't even have in the first place.**
Conversely, I _do_ have the right to use force in defense of my life, liberty, and property, and therefore I have the right to hire a bodyguard to use force to defend the same.
Therefore we have the right to elect a sheriff to defend us -- in fact _it is the same right, delegated._
Furthermore, since our "representatives" can only actually represent us if we have fair representation, then certainly if you were to get together with a hundred of your neighbors and design the proper tax system amongst yourselves, I would agree that tax is fair.
But if the tax system you have today is not the one that you and your neighbors would have designed, then we must question whether or not we are fairly represented anymore in our government -- which certainly does not follow the standards set up by the Constitution.
Therefore since the legitimacy of the social contract rests on the delegation of powers, and on fair representation, I must ask:  **What social contract?**

Bastiat is also an influence:
_"If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right — its reason for existing, its lawfulness — is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups._
_"Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, contrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own individual rights. Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to destroy the equal rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separately can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force that is nothing more than the organized combination of the individual forces?_
_"If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than this:_ **The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense.** _It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all."_

Of course there is nothing wrong with a government, controlled by fair representation, and not engaged in violent force outside the powers properly delegated to it, providing services that the people have voted for.

OT is better at doing certain things that chain-based systems are worse at doing, **and vice-versa.** Therefore, both gain capabilities from integrating together.

* What is Open-Transactions? 
An open-source library for software development, useful for creating your own financial and monetary systems and apps, available in all languages and on all platforms.
In its simplest configuration, it is client/server, but _a more accurate way of thinking would be to say that it is "federated."_ (Like Diaspora, or like the web itself.) The servers should be thought of as cloud commodities, not as authorities. The architecture design is user-centric, not provider-centric.
As it has grown:
**In 2010:**
* A low-level C++ library.
* A low-level test-CLI.
* Prototype server in development.
* _Intended audience: C++ co-developers._
**In 2011:**
* Low-level API in all languages. (Difficult to use in your own code.)
* Low-level C++ library.
* A low-level test-CLI.
* Prototype server in protocol testing.
* _Intended audience: High-level API developers (all languages.)_
**In 2012:**
* High-level API in all languages. **(Easy to use** in your own code.)
* Test-GUI for developers. (Moneychanger.)
* Client-side scripting.
* Low-level API in all languages. (Not recommended.)
* Low-level C++ library, low-level test-CLI.
* Prototype server in real-world (game) testing.
* _Intended audience: Testers of all stripes._
**In 2013:**

**OT's "superpower"** is that it democratizes financial and monetary actions of all stripes. You can use it for issuing currencies/stock, paying dividends, creating asset accounts (or not), sending/receiving digital cash, writing/depositing cheques, cashier's cheques, creating basket currencies, trading on markets, scripting custom agreements, recurring payments, escrow, etc.
It's not just that it does this things, but that _it uses strong crypto to do them._ Meaning, the balances are _unchangeable_ (even by a malicious server.) The receipt history is _destructible._ The transactions are _unforgeable._ The cash is _untraceable._ The cheques are _non-repudiable._ Etc.
The ultimate vision is not OT itself, but the things you can build with it -- where OT is integrated (similar to OpenSSL) into all kinds of software -- MUDs, wifi routers, app servers, Tor bridges, remailers, simulator grids, school projects, shopping carts, web wallets, a multitude of exchanges, games, etc, especially for the purposes of programmatic and automated _resource allocation._
(Whether with real currencies, or virtual currencies, or blockchain-based currencies, or asset-based currencies, or some combination...)
The biggest contributors to OT so far are myself (of course), da2ce7, randy-waterhouse, knotwork, BlueWall, Saag, happywarrior, and many others. See the commit history: 
* **What is Monetas and what are they building?**
I don't know how many people recently read the article about Satoshi's fortune, but it looks like the earliest Bitcoin miner is Satoshi himself, and he's accumulated about $100 million worth of BTC -- all solely from honest mining! -- and _he has been the only person never to sell or transfer away any of his coins._
Which is to say, he is the only person who has shown complete, 100% trust in his own creation. Isn't that amazing?
===&gt; _I feel the same way about Open-Transactions._
===&gt; Therefore, although I have released OT itself as open-source (as it will remain) I have also gotten busy creating separate, commercial software which is _built on-top of the OT platform._
===&gt; Which is to say, Monetas (for-profit company) is entirely separate from OT (open-source community.) Monetas writes commercial software to take advantage of the new capabilities of OT.
===&gt; I am doing this purely because, similar to Satoshi's personal mining, I have 100% confidence in what we have been building with OT, and _I believe that by getting started now_ on various commercial projects using OT, _I will get a huge head-start_ on everyone else who does the same.
* Has Monetas raised $1M in funding?
No. We recently closed our seed round ($300K at $1/share) and we are starting our second round now ($5/share.) **We are very excited!**
* Who is Monetas?
Primarily, myself, Johann Gevers (johann for any business inquiries) as well as Barry Kumnick, who has been busily and quietly architecting for the past 6+ months. There are others. For example, our iPhone app is getting close!
* What is Monetas building?
iPhone app, Android app, Systray app (Chrome plugin, Firefox plugin, Skype plugin, etc) as well as commercial server components for large-scaling and voting pools. (Safe Bitcoin storage.)
We believe in _"doing it right,"_ working layer-by-layer, putting all the pieces together and leveraging the strengths of the new platform(s) we're using.
That's the wide-lens view, anyway.

Open-Transactions is GPL-licensed free software.
How dare you accuse me of not being committed to the ideals of free and open software? I took off work for _years of my life_ in order to work full-time on producing OT as free software for all to benefit from.
How many years of _your_ life have you taken off work, without pay, to do the same?
There is nothing wrong with me starting a company to create commercial software based on OT -- in fact I hope many others will also start companies to build software based on OT. You talk like profit is a moral wrong.
I should also point out that the software being produced by Monetas is also open-source, as it plainly states on the same URL that _you_ posted.

Whichever folder you choose, will be the folder that it adds to your Java path.

I don't see why this is even necessary. This is the mindset that chargebacks cannot be stopped.
But in fact you can beat the chargebacks just by having the right refund policy, combined with having the right procedures and requirements in place, such that the customers who _do_ follow the refund policy must therefore return the coins in order to get the refund, while the customers who _fail_ to follow the refund policy, lose the chargeback as a result.

OT and Ripple are entirely different things.
I don't know if there is nearly as much overlap between them as you apparently believe.
I'll give you some examples: OT provides various different financial instruments such as cheques and cash. Ripple does not. OT processes transactions via signed receipts, whereas Ripple processes transactions using consensus. OT uses destruction of transaction history, whereas Ripple operates based on the extension of f2f credit lines.
The list goes on and on. I'm not saying anything good or bad about either system, only that they do different things and in different ways -- so if you think OT is just "some system like Ripple" then I suggest you educate yourself on the topic.

This sort of thing would be a lot more effective if you did it all along for years in advance.
But now, getting into divorce litigation, if you suddenly pull out a bunch of cash, the judge will likely rule that you owe half of that cash, whether you spent it on hookers or not.
Same thing with your job: If you quit your $100K job 2 years before the divorce, then it's just status quo. But if instead you quit your $100K job immediately upon the start of the divorce, the judge will order your payments AS IF you still had that $100K job. The judge will assume you quit purely out of divorce spite. If you say you don't have that kind of income, the judge will just tell you "You better find a job then."
Asset protection is only effective when the strategy is implemented far in advance -- it's too late once the legal troubles begin.

Regarding Bitcoins and gold, it's important to keep in mind that neither has "intrinsic" value.
Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.
Gold is:
-- Divisible.
-- Fungible.
-- Value dense.
-- Recognizable.
-- Durable.
-- Zero counter-party risk.
-- Stable in supply, yet minable.
-- Liquid.
-- International.
-- Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
By comparison:
-- Diamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.
-- Water, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.
-- Food, while valuable, is not durable.
-- Dollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)
-- Dollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).
-- Dollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)
-- Food, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.
-- Dollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)
Soon it becomes very clear that gold was never "declared" to be a form of money by any "authorities" but rather, became money due to natural market forces.
If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender "laws", tax "laws", money laundering "laws", etc.)
Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.
Now let's consider Bitcoin's unique properties:
-- Divisible.
-- Fungible.
-- Value dense.
-- Recognizable.
-- Durable.
-- Zero counter-party risk.
-- Stable in supply, yet minable.
-- Liquid.
-- International.
-- Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
AS WELL AS:
-- Non-confiscatable.
-- Accounts cannot be frozen.
-- Anonymity is possible.
-- Electronically transferrable.
As you can see, Bitcoin's unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.
Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the government's collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.

I don't know what reason you might have for publicly lying about the Open-Transactions project but I feel the need to post a correction.
Open-Transactions is an open-source software project that began in 2010. There is an open-source community growing around it.
All of Open-Transactions is free software using GPL license. That includes the core library, the high-level API, as well as the server and the command-line client.
Furthermore, the desktop application Moneychanger is also GPL licensed, and the source code is available on Github.
Monetas is a company started in 2012 for the purpose of building commercial software that uses the OT library.
You posted the link: 
If you actually click on that link, you will see the first "key feature" is _"Open-source - trust, but verify"_
This is because any Monetas software that includes the OT library will have to also obey the GPL license.
