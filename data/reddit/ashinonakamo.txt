As a 'relatively' long time bitcoin user, a long time ago you would see 1st confirmation in 10mins on a tx like this.  So it's all relative when people say 'delay'.

If that was the case, for me it'll still outperform my stock portfolio...

Oh sorry, this was done from gdax!  So technically no fees for me.

See my post.  tldr: yes.

I talked to a bunch of stranger this past week.  All of them still thought we were on the gold standard...
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:38:37
My take is that it's basically similar to the bartering rules.  You pay tax on the value of the BTC at the time of the tx.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:37:17
Did... you even read what you linked?  "profit of financial trading".  Guess what bitcoin trading is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:39
Lol, thanks?  Honestly, if you think about it, transfering that large of an amount in fiat would have taken days, so.... trust in the network!

Auto loan bubble at 1.1 trillion.  And when it bursts, it's going to cascade into repo, and then people will be fired for not showing up for work.  It's going to be way worse than the housing bubble.
There is no student loan bubble (at least in the US) because it can't be canceled after bankruptcy, and it is also backed by US gov.  So unless either of those condition changes.. it's not a bubble that can burst.

You mean investing?
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:26:31
What are you willing to spend your btc on?
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:35:43
Invest in a blockchain related start up. e.g. A new exchange, A new business that uses bitcoin, A new hardware wallet company, etc. None of those are investing in bitcoin.  But like most investments, you have to have money first to make money. Bitcoin doesn't really change that reality.

Very cool but I am guessing for production you still something a bit beefy?

taking a trip to Japan in December, can I use crypto to buy things as a foreigner? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:24:31
My base is 1700, that's when I start loosing principle. But in the mean time, i'll probably use some btc to buy a monitor or two.
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:26:05
There's an easier way..  Just sign a message with the private key and let others verify it.  No invalid transactions, no moving funds, no nothing.  If they have the private key, that proves they own the bitcoin reserve.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:32:41
And we are going to trust a 'trusted auditor' like we did with Gox, Tether, etc?  Sorry, but the whole point is we don't need a 'trusted' auditor.  The ledger is the audit.  All we want is proof of reserve. As for privacy. The people who knows the utxo's knows the identity of the transaction so it's not a privacy issue.
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:08:38
they aren't wrong.  3400 is below 4000. so is 1000. so is 100.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:25:58
No one is asking if their liabilities exceed their assets. No one is asking how much fiat they claim.  This is solely about proof of reserve on the blockchain. In another word, how much is in their UTXO. That's it. Simple. They can state whatever liabilities and assets they want on their financial statements.  The proof of reserve should be greater or equal to just one in their statement - "Deposits (bitcoin)".  See 
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:10:47
You realize a large portion of exchange volume is from vendors converting their bitcoin?  If that volume is low it means people are using bitcoin less and that only means less demand.
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:42:30
Yup, it was a big fail in front of several people. Obv, those people aren't going to be using bitcoin anytime soon now. lol
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:10:24
bitcoin is like tcp/ip.  a protocol. and people certainly run their own internal network.  So I wouldn't be surprised if some organization use the bitcoin protocol for their own use..
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:49:55
is 1L37m5WZbaKiTSWHNuE9Bi9TNaMWenxkDf really yours?  the dec 2 shows bitcoin going in then going out about an hour later to 1HyGYNArPsymz7Gm2LsLHDj2CRVCSfRdG
In fact it even says from: 1L37m5WZbaKiTSWHNuE9Bi9TNaMWenxkDf so that address is from where you bought your bitcoin.

Headline is true if you don't know about the 51% attack which, 'Most People' don't know about.  It's kind of funny they mention 5%, because that's very arbitrary.  Infact you just need &gt;50%, so 50.0000001% is enough. If you want to be pedantic, you just need 50% + 1 node to execute this attack.

It kinda feels like nosql.  Everyone was saying it would solve lots of problems.  Turns out.. it only solved a few problems really well.  Very few.  blockchain apps solves the distributed trust problem.  But there's really not that many real life problems that requires distributed trust when central trust works well.

Localbitcoins the site will probably be blocked soon based on that announcement because they provide pricing information.
