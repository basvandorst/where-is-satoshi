I'm sorry, what? 
Lets say I buy a ticket to Disney World that will never expire for $100. I do this so that I can go to Disney at a time of my choosing, but then Disney starts raising the price of entry by 25% every year. Do I go now or later? Well, I can always use it to go to Disney, but I don't *need* to go right now and all the extra profit from the raised price will probably lead to some new attractions down the line that will make my experience even better. Or, I could just hold the ticket and sell it for a profit. Either way, it's smarter for me to hold off on that until Disney tapers off their yearly price increase. That doesn't make the ticket any less of a valid ticket.

This is because it is in early adoption and completely decentralized. There is not higher power mandating that "this is the currency you use now." So, the price starts to steadily rise because people are converting their cash to crypto for whatever reason (hold as investment, buying something on the deep web, "believing in it," etc.). When onlookers see this rise, they see a 'get rich quick' scheme. They buy a shit load, raise the demand/price, then dump it, which lowers it again. The transaction fee is something that will naturally lower as networks improve and use stabilizes.
That's my read, at least. I've bought Bitcoin, I've spent Bitcoin, and I've still got some Bitcoin. It may never actually catch on. It might sink to pennies and fade into obscurity. I've got my fingers crossed, though. Decentralized currency with a public, unified cryptographic ledger sounds like it could do a lot of good for the world.

Bitcoin can be split down to the eighth decimal place, which is called a Satoshi. That means there are 100,000,000 Satoshi in 1 Bitcoin. So, for example, 1 USD is currently worth 17,087 Satoshi. There are currently 12,446,725 Bitcoins currently in existence and only 21 million will ever be produced. That means that there will eventually be 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshi (2.1 Quintillion). If you took all the money on Earth and converted it to USD, you'd have less than 1 Quadrillion. There would be far more than enough Bitcoin to cover all of that, even including the 100 cents that compose a dollar.
Even the current number of Bitcoins is more than enough to handle it.

Yea, but if you're only spending what you'd be okay with losing (ie: you can buy a new video game or 15 shares of a weed stock), then it's not all that bad. You're paying for the roller coaster ride, which you can learn from and get better at choosing which coasters are best. 
Also, them gains.
