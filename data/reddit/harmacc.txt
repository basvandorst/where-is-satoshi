Fire burn.

I think you meant fiat shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:58:24
I hope somewhere, someone realizes that the media is not their friend.

small single card miners had to wait months to cashout their $100. Many were hit a week away from that. Some buyers lost 10s of thousands though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:57
it was a bullshit wallet. Kindof like an I.O.U wallet where they apparently kept all the money in one place.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:02:55
nicehash has a wallet you can use. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:29:31
dont worry, i got it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:13
go to nicehash and download the miner. start mining alts, and they payout in btc. check your hardware profitibility here 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:04
if you want to hobby mine part time just use nicehash. I make about $40 a month with a i76700k and 1060 gpu.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:40:00
You would do better to just buy the coins with that money, it will probably take over a year to pay for itself. If you want to mine for fun check out that profitability calculator I linked. The new ryzen CPUs do about 1.50 a day, and a gtx 1070 will bring in about the same.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:06:35
you can use purse.io to buy from amazon with btc.

In 5 years, that game will have cost you $25,000 :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:16:44
if it goes to 5000 this week and next month to 8000, why do you care as long as you dont sell on the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:53:35
It will  pay for itself. There is a nicehash sub on here you can check out. lots of threads that cover your questions. Im thinking about adding a couple of GPUs myself. I mine with my editing pc about 20 hours a day. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:12:20
I wish the lambo thing would go away. That’s how semi rich people end up being poor in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:00:05
And eth is $100! Last time I looked it was $12!
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:51:26
The mainstream media is shit in ALL cases. This just happens to be a subject you care about. Its best to avoid them.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:45:25
Nobel prizes mean dick. Obama got one for peace, and was at war his entire presidency. 
Besides, I do think krugman doesn’t know shit about his  current “expertise”. Unless that expertise is only Keynesian economics, and not actual economics.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:50:13
That used to be AJ. Then he sold out, started supporting Trump. The Alex Jones of today is not the AJ of a decade ago.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:58:33
To be fair, krugman sucks on any and all economics. He can’t broken window his way out either. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:34:51
The crash of the dollar will be the real crypto moon. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:22:03
It will be great when it happens, but why muddy the waters with half truths?
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:48:21
The smug look the whole time was the best
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:44:27
This made me grin so big. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:34:40
It is completely acceptable to think this. It’s not however to think this, and then proceed to invest. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:06:35
No worries. Have a good day my man. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:02:09
Weeks. Especially in the last few months. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:01:27
Never get between a statist and their heroes. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:57:33
I hope krugman thinks crypto will fail, because that guy is ass backwards on anything of importance.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:56:31
This is like saying amazon accepts bitcoin because you can buy at purse.io
Whole Foods doesn’t accept BTC. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:20:57
Businesses have lost me over bitpay. I’m not jumping through hoops. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:33:54
I was not disagreeing. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:05:22
Give it six months. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:45:23
It’s been great. Ask me again in three months. Ask me again in three years. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:43:30
Sorry, long day. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:11:40
Didn’t say you don’t read in general. I assumed you weren’t familiar with the material you were disparaging based on your comments. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:10:05
Spoken by someone who hasn’t read those books and has no idea what they are talking about. Literally nobody who reads those kind of books thinks they will be like “V” 
They probably even know the true story the movie was based on. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:07:49
It’s simply not aggressing against other unless being aggressive upon. The question that gets people in the weeds is the “what constitutes aggression” question. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:17:00
So did a guy I know who was at war every single day of his 8 year presidency. His was for peace though if it matters. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:08:12
It’s on YouTube too in audio form.
