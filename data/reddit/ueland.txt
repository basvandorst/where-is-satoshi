I picked the wrong day to set up my Ledger Nano S ...
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:55:27
Yup, but one never knows that. The electricity costs is not of a concern since it will be used to heat up my apartment anyways. (a plus of living a cold place)

It fluxates a lot, i would say $6 is the average now a day, i`d make more if i always mined the most vauable altcoin, but i just let NiceHash fix everything. (Set and forget)

I built one and use it to mine altcoins and I get paid daily in btc, built it in June and have already made a profit. Can't say I can complain over such a quick ROI.

3 x 1070 cards in a dedicated machine, gets around $6 per day at current prices. So the primary profit is from HODLing the btc. I have started selling of some of it to cash out the cost of the miner.

How long before the mempool starts clearing out? With the difficulty adjustment I fear we are talking many weeks. Have a transaction that are stuck since Dec 10 now. Tried a child-pays-for-parent earlier today at 500sat/B, still no dice.

No need to call people names.
Oh; and WikiLeaks ARE a Russian front, where do you think they get all the large dumps from, and why do you think they always align with the Russian point of view ;) Due to the nature of the intelligence sector it's a bit harder to proof since such proofs are hidden for years but all intelligence personel I have seen says so for a reason.
The fact that WikiLeaks have been denying to release data about stuff in Russia, like their actions in Ukraine does not exact give them the benefit of doubt.

Standard practice on (regular) stock exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:08:09
The same applies for everybody in here that has invested for the last months/years, so yeah.

Do. not. Store. Your. Bitcoins. On. An. Exchange.
You can assume that until you move them, you do not get anything from any fork and you will lose everything the day the exchange gets hacked/goes down.

That is correct :), yet they could have released so much more if they wanted to, latest issue regarding that here:

im heating my apartment with something that pays $6 per day, doesnt sound like a loss to me, my regular electric heating doesn`t pay me anything ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:41:01
I dont use coinbase, i have had my bitcoins on a regular (PC) wallet but have moved to a hardware based now. No comment on which, i reccomend you read up on it and decide yourself. :)
Hardware wallets can cost a bit, so i wouldnt use it unless i had "enough" btc to worry.

...which is what one does at NiceHash
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:33:35
When you get it, do not work on the drive more than you need, take a "forensic copy" of the drive (image it), then work against the image. It is a lot safer to (for example) look for deleted files that way. Msg me if you need some more advice on that part.

Where in Orlando is this?

Bitcoin.com has a bad reputation, look into nicehash.com instead
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:54:15
Nobody knows the answer, they who claim that simply lies :)

I somehow doubt that you have a 5 gigabit internet connection.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:51:20
I have a gigabit connection at home, I wouldn't even notice the traffic. I have a node for my btc since that's what you get when running on Ubuntu. But I have decided not to open it to the internet due to security concerns.

It's because they themselves choose what they want to publish, they will not, for example, publish large amounts of negative materials on the Russians.
They are not labeled a front of Russian intelligence just for fun.
