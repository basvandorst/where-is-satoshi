It's totally possible if you know what you're doing. On the other hand, Erlang/Elixir were built for concurrency and are (imo) more fun to write in.

I'm not a fan of ultimatum and blackmail. Just release the info or don't, and let things work themselves out.

Bitcoin's origins may be libertarian, but it's current application (as an alternative currency/commodity) is apolitical. It's like gold. The gold standard may be a libertarian ideal, but buying and using gold as an alternative is not.

Nice to meet you too!

Am I the only non-Libertarian person who loves bitcoin? I just think it's a better way to buy online and, potentially, a better way to buy overseas.

It says right on the homepage "this is a product built for developers." With all of the confusion about the product, there is clearly something wrong communication-wise on their end, but it does say in several places that it's "for developers".
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:32:20
Only once.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:52:48
You should explain to Thunderwulf that bitcoin can be immediately converted to USD, so price fluctuation is irrelevant. That's arguably the most common misconception, and (I think) a big reason why BTC doesn't have more supporters. 
Also: fuck yes! I'd love to buy Diablo expansion with BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:17:34
Since BTC is currently increasing in value, I agree that it's always good to hold on to SOME bitcoin. However, because I was going to buy the book either way, it makes more sense to make the purchase in bitcoin.
If I just bought it with cash, I'd be out $100. Instead, I bought bitcoin to buy the book. Now, because of bitcoins growing value, I have the book and some bitcoin left over (which I can save if I want). 
Basically, making all online purchases with bitcoin means I can have my cake and eat it too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:47:49
I could deal with that. But let's shoot for $100!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:53:03
Let's get back down to 13 bucks. Then we can take a slow, steady increase over the next few years while increasing merchant adoption, consumer spending, etc. The word's getting out on bitcoin, now we just need the strong foundation.

I'll always upvote awesome bitcoin art!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:45:17
That's true. But, for the majority of the things I'm talking about, I don't think that would be an issue. Graffiti, yes. But for live TV, billboards, etc, I don't think so. Unless, as with Game Day Guy, it's shared around in pictures. Even then, I think it will be less of an issue when these things are more of a norm than the exception.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:44:35
I was pointing out that if the current valuation is about as high as it will ever be (as the article suggests), that it couldn't feasibly take 10% of the e-commerce market. But my comment was incorrect, because I didn't take into account that different people would be able to spend the same bitcoin. 
But, yes! I understand the divisibility. Upvoting because someone new might be reading this thread, and you did a good job of of explaining this important to understand aspect of btc. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:15:54

I agree that it's a little too confusing for the average consumer at the moment. But I think it's getting more user-friendly, and will continue to get easier. It won't be widely accessible all at once, but I believe it will steadily draw enthusiastic crowds. 
If you lump everyone currently involved into a "techno-savvy" group, I think the next group will be young Wall Street types (more for personal investment than serious) and gamers -- two groups that will have a lot of fun with digital currencies and playing the market.
edit for specificity: these groups, while potentially less techno-savvy, will be intrigued by the market and are technologically proficient enough to navigate the ever-simplifying bitcoin landscape.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:00:55
Thank you, that's my first tip! You're doing a cool thing -- both artistically, and for bitcoin. I'll be following your site for more work.

I always get boned using paypal, because they assure me that if I have insufficient funds in my bank account, they will default to my credit card. Never happens. I've overdrafted twice because of that. But I think I've finally learned my lesson.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:43:53
I just got back from the bank, which is closed on sundays, and takes a day to process checks. So now my rent is going to be two days late, when I've had the money since sunday. Like you said, if this was bitcoin, things would be different.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:36:02
Either post in bitcoinbeg, or (even better) you could post in jobs4bitcoin. Earn your BTC, or be clever about your begging. Make a giant QR crop circle code that can be seen from google earth. Then people will give you money. Because at least you made them happy.

I have an iPhone. For all of the other bitcoin users with an iPhone who want to buy/sell btc with Coinbase -- the text messaging interface is actually pretty great. 
You can buy, sell, check price, balance, etc via text messages. Great option until Apple either accepts bitcoin apps or you can switch phones.

Actually, thinking about it, that would be a really interesting way for graffiti artists to get paid for their work. 
Just think: if/when BTC is widely adopted, a highly public painting with an integrated QR could net more profit than selling a painting ever could...
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:46:10
Yeah, I've had long delays before. Just never 3 returned bitcoins in a row :/

**A** value of Bitcoin, not 'the'. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:05:33
I agree that this article isn't quite as positive as people are making it out to be, but I don't get the 10% of all B2C transactions. Global B2C is already over $1 trillion dollars -- 10% at the current valuation would require more BTC than there will ever be. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:21:57
Attractive site. 10/10 would look at it again.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:27:07
Bitcoin sometimes has a small transaction fee (I've never had a fee higher than .0002btc, most often .0001btc), but is less than a 2-3% credit card processing fee and interest rates. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:34:32
That looks like it's all PS4, and I'm getting xbox one first. But I'm definitely bookmarking the site for later -- this is the first I've heard of it, awesome recommendation!

I spent some time yesterday coming up with passphrases on BrainWallet -- I've managed to find a surprising number of accounts that way.

Yeahhhh, I'm jumping on the bits train.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:48:53
Yeah, that was the closest I could find. But, again, it's mostly people looking for work that pays 1+BTC, and, aside from my own, I only found one low-price creative post.
Maybe that's all people want?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:42:33

For all the non-tech people I just say, "It's internet money with fast transactions, no personal info, and ultra-low fees." 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:15:55
I don't think it would go much lower than that -- 500 sounds about right if the panic sells align properly.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:54:05
I can't imagine it dropping to 250, but God I hope so. I think people will start mass-purchasing if it gets close to 500. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:31:17
Oh, damn. I wanted to 'reward' an independent store for accepting bitcoins, so I was trying to avoid gyft or snapcard. But those 0% fees are almost too good to pass up. I guess there's no reason to limit myself to just one haha
whollyhemp seems interesting, my SO is all about her skin care products. That could be a smooth move. Thanks for the rec!

So realistic. Could we get a photoshop tutorial on that? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:08:53
The processing fee is technically on the merchant side, but they can add a surcharge to cover the cost of the credit card fee. Which, in NYC (where I live), happens a little too often. 
Online, avoiding credit card fees associated with paypal often leads to a discount for purchases made with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:25:34
1. The reason to accept bitcoin is the same reason they should accept any currency. Just because they convert the euro to the dollar doesn't mean they shouldn't accept euro.
2. With BTCs appreciating value, I would be more likely to buy their games if I could use bitcoin. A lot of bitcoin supporters would do the same thing, as evidenced by the overwhelming support of small businesses that accept bitcoin payment. 
3. They could use bitpay to accept payment and the associated fees would be smaller than accepting credit card.

Maybe new-comer family members will buy in near the bottom and, after earning a few percent, will become the next breed of bitcoin fanatics? Here's to hoping.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:54:23
Well I fuckin' hope it crashes so I can buy more at the bottom. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:16:42
That's what I was planning. But I might get greedy and try to wait it out too long and have to catch it back on the upswing...
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:57:21
That sounds about right to me. People already seem used to the idea that bitcoin is worth over $1K -- a lot of people will buy in at the drop.

Edit: My initial point seems to have gotten away from me -- retitle as, "Bitcoin could revolutionize EVERYTHING." 
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:20:31
True. 
Theoretically, a consumer could get little benefit making purchases online with btc. That being said, I offer discounts to people who pay with bitcoin so that I can avoid paypal's credit card fees. I think that's a trend that's likely to continue. If not? There's still the fun! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:14:42
1. I'm sorry, but this is a giant fucking pet peeve of mine. If you're asking someone for handouts, don't thank them in advance. It's presumptive and disrespectful. 
2. Also it's, "Thank you in advance." But you should probably go ahead and forget that fuck-off of a phrase. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:00:56
The increasing value has actually encouraged me to spend more BTC. If I want to buy something online that costs $100, a buy 100 bucks worth of BTC, wait for the value to go up a little bit and then make the purchase.
That way, every single time I buy something, I end up with what I wanted plus some leftover bitcoin.
