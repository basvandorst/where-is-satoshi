And why you are panic selling your BTC is beyond me, but thank you.

I'm shocked reading how many people here thought USDT was ever really worth anything.. it was designed to be an a functional tool for trading crypto efficiently.. 
I mean what did you guys think you were buying?! What purpose did USDT ever have except temporarily exiting a market? Did you think you could buy something with your USDT? It's always been fake, but that didn't mean it wasn't useful.

Who knows haha

I should note, I'm irritated because I freaking love bitcoin and want it to function beautifully.

Will this be beneficial to someone who made a transaction at 180 sat/byte last week that still hasn't confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:19
I've not been paid by anybody.
I don't know anything about Roger.
But, I am pissed off bitcoin allowed its functionality degenerate to the point that it has. I saw this coming last night and attempted to move some coin around to a safer location. Guess what? Transaction got completely swallowed by the incompetence of the Blockchain. I didn't want to sell my bitcoin. I did want the ability to sell it. Now, in the midst of chaos, my bitcoin is, umm where exactly? In the freakin' cloud somewhere. Maybe I'll get access to it in a few more hours. Maybe a few more days. Maybe in weeks.
Yes, I'm irritated. And if you call me a shill, that only makes me wonder if you are, because I'm completely rational.

Crushed? I don't know if that's accurate. Annoyed, maybe.

I know exactly where my bitcoin is, Jerk. Work on your reading comprehension, instead of just waiting for your turn to reply with tired old phrases.

Thanks for going easy on, Woody. I get it .. but, man .. Hindsight, yeah, I probably would have paid $50. But, I can't blame myself for knocking A FEW sat/bytes off. By the way, at the time there was an estimated delivery of 14 hours. Last night I knew something was up, but it wasn't until this afternoon that stuff starting getting really weird. That's when it got swallowed. But, you're right.

At least they mentioned people banking on their phones.

Hi Matt,
I am experiencing a pretty substantial lag on binance, to this day. Are you aware of this issue? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:32:10
Margin trading crypto sounds pretty terrifying.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:14:42
It's bitcoin are you guys kidding it could be tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:41:18
The only 0 in this equation is the amount of evidence that bitcoin will fail.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:14:00
You have a very short memory
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:10:01
Is it really a falling knife, though? I mean.. you can look at an order book and pretty much determine with dead on accuracy when about it will meet support. It's really not that hard.

Here is some amateur opinion from one student to another.
1. crypto-fiat is easier. Crypto-crypto gets pretty complicated. If you do it, make sure to keep a close eye on BTC or ETH charts.
2. I wouldn't day trade more than $300-$500 until you know what you are doing. You can make minimum wage off this.
3. 3% gains is a good starting goal.
4. That's anybody's guess.
5. 
6. For day trading, usually small potential gains. Longer trades would usually be called swing trading or something else.
7. Study volume, subscribe to some alert system/scanner or set up alerts yourself. Volume is key to pinpointing when a dip has finished. It's tough!
8. 
9. Volatility 
10. Good luck!
