What's to win for the consumer? Transactions take a lot of time (sometimes hours) to be approved, there is no consumer protection against fraudulant merchants, and prices are the same.

I believe "liberals" (in the American political sense of the world) are actually for more government regulation, and thus would consider a currency not backed by force to be worse.

Can you explain the difference?

So I gave him my card. He swipes it and his terminal shuts down. No receipt ever comes out of the machine.
Now he wants me to charge me again. I had to log in on my phone to internet banking to show him the payment appears on my statement. If I didn't have a smartphone, I would have paid twice. If I didn't have a smartphone, I would have paid twice.
No system is perfect. Same with bitcoins.
No you wouldn't - it's not the same. If you had been charged twice, you could call your credit card company, explained it, and they would have cancelled one of the two transactions on your behalf. I speak from experience.  With bitcoin, there would be absolutely nothing you could do. It's not the same AT ALL.

The problem is that you're failing to understand that the interview was not about YOU, it was about BITCOIN. While it may not be important to YOU that you lost many Bitcoins, it's important to the people reading the article. That's why it has been quoted. You should never think of journalists as your personal PR agency - they're here to report on Bitcoins, not on your personal mood.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:09:52
You know when you are playing roulette, and you put it on black all the time, and lost about 25% of your initial sum.... the only answer is to continue playing on black. And if you run out of chips, like Dakar said, you should buy more chips, and go to the ATM and use your credit card to withdraw more chips. That's what winners do. 
Right, folks?
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:04:18
No, we laugh in our beards at all those claims that you'll be rich, fully knowing that when it comes to withdrawing your money, shit hits the fan.

Couldn't we say the exact same about the dollar, though?
Ohhhh.... but wait, management of the dollar is regulated.

I have money invested in the stock market too. I'm not angry. But I don't feel like supporting you folks with social assistance with my own taxpayer, rightfully earned money, when you've invested all your life savings in Buttcoins in an attempt to get rich quick and we warned you it was a bad idea, and their value was flushed down the toilet. And before you claim that you shouldn't buy ("invest* *couch* lol) more than you can afford to lose, I know some of you did exactly that and posted about it on Reddit, too.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:22:22
Yeah but the overwhelming majority of people lost tons of money, some of their life savings after you encouraged them to "invest". But F-them, right? You're a true hero.

Somebody posted a comment about Bitcoin being a cult and it was promptly deleted, but I had time to save my answer, so here it is: 
- *The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.*


- *Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members*


- *The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.*


- *The leader is not accountable to any authorities*


- *The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.*


- *The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.*


- *The group is preoccupied with making money.*


- *The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.*


@_date: 2014-02-14 03:43:22


Why would those people use Bitcoin as opposed to fiat?
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:04:37
You missed the part when we warned you about the dangers of bitcoins when things were looking good, and your community's religious zealot response was intended to hurt or make non-believers feel badly, litterally calling for boycots, threats against non-bitcoin believers, harassing corporations and organizations to accept bitcoin, and encouraging smashing iphones and protesting in public. It was trolling back then and it's trolling now. 
The only thing that has changed is that now bitcoin believers actually feel hurt this time instead of us, because reality is smashing them in the face. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:01:18


Because they want to interview someone from the BITCOIN community, and voorhees happened to volunteer for it? Could it not be any more obvious? They could have interviewed anybody for all they care, voorhees just ended up being the random person that crossed their path. The article was NOT "Here's what voorhees thinks about Bitcoin". Nobody really cares, except voorhees, about what voorhees think. People care about what Bitcoin means for the rest of the world.

No because Reddit does not have a us-versus-them mentality, isn't focused on making money, believes in life outside the context of the group, and questioning, doubt, and dissent are encouraged and even rewarded.

So are you sure that the estimate returns a positive ROI? Because we're already sure that the ROI will be negative for at least 2 months. If you're not sure, that it'll be positive after 2 months, it's a gamble.

That has to be one of the most overpriced and ugliest house I've ever seen. It looks like a mobile home on a yard.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:05:17
Considering the difficulty is increasing every 2 weeks, unlike normal investments, this guarantees that the investment will be less and less profitable over the long term. The question is? Can this investment be profitable fast enough before it gets unprofitable again? (assuming your house doesn't burn down from an electrical failure in the process)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:27:02

Fax is such a still-in-demand service that now many offices allow to print directly to fax numbers and receive fax as email attachments (as opposed to avoiding the fax protocol altogether). Trust me, Fax is still big.

It's the "return to normal". I'd advise selling now while bitcoin value is still above zero.

Actually, if they accept credit cards, they cannot offer a discount to customers for not using one. It's against their contract, and credit card companies will sue you to the ground if you do it. One of my local PC shops used to offer a 3% discount if you paid cash or by interac. They were a really good store but were bankrupt after a year or two, and I believe the fact that they got sued had a lot to do with it.

Duh. Their value is still above zero.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:51:07
Well I looked at a range of numbers between 0 and Infinity, and figured that the last two crashes were at a peak of around 1200, and that everybody who wants to hear about bitcoin has heard about bitcoin already, and assuming people learn from their mistake, they'll assume that it'll peak at 1200 gain, and thus will start selling before that, at 1100.
  
But people learning from their mistake might be giving them too much credit. In all honest truth, nobody has a single clue what the value of bitcoins is since no merchant lists its price in fixed bitcoins but only in USD or local currency convertible into bitcoins and bitcoins are divisible infinitely, making any bitcoin value plausible. 
  
Go ahead and downvote me.

In the case of investments, even for risky ones, there are many ways to estimate an adequate value of a stock: current earnings, company assets, projected earnings, market size, competitors, level of business risk, credit risk, political risk, industry risk, market risk, etc. 
In the case of bitcoins, there is pretty much none. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:09:54
I think you meant: 
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:47:59


  
I do mind, because it's been explained by other people countless times, but it has to do with the mining requirements, the time required for transactions to be approved, the ease it is for scammers to steal extremely large amounts of money through various fraudulent ways with no ability to charge back, the extreme volatility of the currency seen so far causing bitcoin accepting vendors to list their prices in USD and not bitcoins, and the ease for a hacker to also steal extremely large amounts of money. Yes, I'm aware that normal wallets can be stolen with a gun, but how many people routinely carry $100,000 cash in their wallet by "accident" or under their matress?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:07:54


Actually, that is an incomplete definition of Investment.
Investopedia explains 'Investment':
  
The building of a factory used to produce goods and the investment one makes by going to college or university are both examples of investments in the economic sense. 
  
In the financial sense investments include the purchase of bonds, stocks or real estate property. 
  
** Be sure not to get 'making an investment' and 'speculating' confused. Investing usually involves the creation of wealth whereas speculating is often a zero-sum game; wealth is not created. Although speculators are often making informed decisions, speculation cannot usually be categorized as traditional investing.  **

Traders want to collect as much information as possible from as many sources as posisble, and thus should watch variations and trends from all possible charts.
