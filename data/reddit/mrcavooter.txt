Tons of ERC20 tokens are going nuts right now. Might be part of it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:28:18
Use gemini.com

Yeaaaaaaa boiiiiiiii (or girl, but probably boiiiiiiii)
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:35:10
MyYes you can. You can wrote off up to $3000(?) a year and it rolls over. I may be wrong on the number, but do your own research.
Edit: shit, I read that "can't". But I'm gonna leave it so I don't censor the thread.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:14:40
I bought some computer hardware with BTC today. Oh and I BTFD.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:38:45
I enjoyed this thread. Thanks!

Transfer from coinbase to GDAX then to your external wallet for $0 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:14:32
These actually belong in the daily discussion thread. But you're right.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:54:12
Buy the dip then
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:36:17
I didn't know that, but I take everything on here with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:07:34
Thanks for the quality post! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:32:13
Are you mayor jackass of that land?
I assumed you went BTC to fiat for some of your transactions. I take it most of your transactions are BTC/BTC?
If you want to promote your way of being a BTC pioneer, maybe answering simple questions about it without the ridiculousness would help spread adoption faster.

Venezuela is on the cusp of hyperinflation (50% inflation per month), yikes!
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:39:54
Great piece, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:54:25
I agree with you completely. The current state of the echo chamber is lame.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:28:58
I meant is there a maximum dollar amount you can charge in one swipe? For example, could one make a purchase in the ballpark of the cost of a new vehicle?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:02:59
Is there a per swipe maximum for these?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:42:55
Buy more and lower the average cost/BTC. It will take some of the sting away form the $20k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:40:35
The echo chamber is strong. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:34:27
Cool, thanks for the update
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:07:41
OPEC and printing money
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:22:08
Time in the market is better than timing the market for long term gainz
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:59
Correct. And OPEC flooded the market with oil in an attempt to price out fracking sites in the US and Canada, dropping the price of oil and destroying Venezuela's major (95%) cash flow.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:44:44
Yea buddy, thanks! Just book marked it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:41:49
Time in the market is better than timing the market. DCA, for me, makes me less stressed because I can spread out the principal over time. Easier on the pocket book.
But you're right, there is a lot of evidence for lump sum investing. We all just need to be realistic about what we can individually invest responsibly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:26:41
Do you pay capital gains on all your transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:15:50
Yea, 3 years later
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:35:58
Congrats on sobriety, it's the best thing you could have done for yourself. Now, don't be hard on yourself. Just attack each day the best you can. The rest will fall in place. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:00:51
Sorry for being short. I do like it, thanks for the effort you put in.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:37:45
Yes, get the stress off your back and play with house money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:10:16
Except it didn't drop 30%
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:20:16
Exactly...Zoom the chart out and look at the spike in 2012. 
Not sure what you're getting at.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:27:26
This sub is full of fantasy lately.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:41:29
If you believe in the tech and are in long term, the price today does not matter.
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:15:14
Stole it from Twitter
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:30:29
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:36:34
You're right
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:57:29
Please add zcash
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:41:34
Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I have been kicking around the idea of going BTC only for a full month and the BTC cards that convert to fiat just don't do it for me. I will definitely look into these links. 
Thanks again.

My friend bout 2 BTC alpaca socks.

Sick buzzwords
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:35:54
Nice, best of luck!

Let's meme our way back to the bull market boys.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:45:43
is it a tor exit node though?
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:07:57
I sold a bunch at $120 cause it was a 2x and I was a college student. Holding from sub $1 to 5 digits requires a special kind of temporal imbalance.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:28:12
Yea, motorbiking SOLO too... This isn't smart
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:56:02
mediocre 
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:27:17
Not to mention the security aspect. Anyone in crypto should stay away from windows.
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:59:39
jesus christ these people make me pray for another year of downtrend
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:16:44
What about all the dying babies?
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:31:19
Yup, I was thinking it looked toppy.
@_date: 2019-05-28 04:53:28
Nice charts. Anywhere you share charts regularly?
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:14:38
Reek, reek it rhymes with leek
@_date: 2013-07-21 07:33:27
I like this setup, congrats!
