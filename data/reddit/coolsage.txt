And what do the experts say?

I think this redditor explained it really well in a simple way.

So I’m just interested in bitcoin. Can’t really buy or mine it but how does mining work. I never fully understand it, all I hear of is rigs and that’s about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:26:34
So the miner doesn’t really need to do anything themselves except maintain the rig? And how do you know if your system has solved it?

I liked his explanation. It was simple and to the point. The 3 month graph is definitely not to scale but it’s the concept of it that made sense. Idk if Bit will bite the dust or keep going up in value(hoping for this) because I don’t keep up with it enough nor do I know of any “major bubble in modern history” as you’ve mentioned...

I don’t have any bit to begin with. Very late to the train lol. My cousin had 3 and sold at $600. I have Lite and it’s been rocketing as Bit has been falling.

That is why I used someone else’s opinion...

I love watching bit climb but I don’t have $$ to invest. My friend put some of his financial aid and parts of his paychecks in and made maybe ~$1000

Exactly, I really appreciate the barley moving standard that is gold. Very low fluctuation rates, love the stability.
