Sharding appears to be the closest yet but there's always a trade-off.

Yes, this is worrisome. Although one thing that's promising to me is the use cases here. What will super fast and secure payments allow us to buy? Low priced items like coffee and even Pizza become practical again to buy with BTC. I suspect holding hot wallets with small amounts of BTC will go a long way for merchants who need fees to be as low as possible for low priced items. This could potentially carve out a niche for Bitcoin where you have two-tiered payment methods until the security of or around hot wallets improves. Just a thought.

Unless they go after setting up their own exit nodes like regular TOR. But yeah, I agree this is a much better solution than no protection.

If this catches on someone will add support to hardware wallets.

Funny that. Natural medicine that saves lives is a threat to Big Pharma so not surprised. Good for you on working through the BS. Wish you luck.

If I were you I would pretend I'm not the NSA.

Those people (my parents for example) will never catch on. That's a generation of write-offs for the most part.

For sure the barrier of entry needs to be significantly lowered. There will always be luddites regardless of age. Good point.

The regulators are stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they "ban" Bitcoin now, they miss out on collecting taxes on a 200+ billion market as the market will naturally switch to more privacy oriented coins (XMR/ZCASH). If this happens government will get zero money in taxes. The worst-case scenario for government is to force Cryptocurrencies underground and they would force this by banning or heavily regulating Bitcoin/Ether/etc. What they should do is continue to work with exchanges to ensure KYC compliance, that's about their only option if they don' want to lose out completely.

...which is smart if you want to keep said Bitcoin safe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:22:53
I don't mean to be that guy but it's not worth avoiding paying your fair share of taxes.

Love him or hate him he secured Andreas future with a mean tweet. I say Roger deserves a caricature :D

This sounds big but won't work on the native chain without lightening or something scalable. Also Ethereum has had uPort for well over a year now that allows for federated services and IDM through self sovereignty. Perhaps Microsoft's created something similar for the Bitcoin Blockchain but I think this is something even bigger given their resources. Interesting tweet indeed.

I'm sorry for your loss. Hopefully this post will be a wake up call for others in a similar situation.  The best lesson I learned was losing a fuck ton of coins early on so. Sometimes people just get stuck in an infinite loop of regret rather than taking life's lessons, learning from them, and moving forward.

This **ENTERPRISE** dude jammed two NFC chips (one in each hand) on his person. Each chip holds 888 Bytes. Just wondering the best uses for Bitcoin here. 
Some ideas that come to mind:
 * Storage of recovery passphrases. 
 * Multi-sig transactions
 * Second Factor Auth for Bitcoin wallet transactions
 * Paper wallets
Any other thoughts what these tags could be used for in relation to Bitcoin or other crypto currencies?

90% Ether,  10% BTC, but 100% Crypto-Currency. I see investing in traditional markets more of a risk than Crypto-Currency due to the manipulated centralized nature of fiat and a debt based economy.  Sure buy a house and pay it off ASAP but other than that what else would you trust your money in? Even precious metals are controlled.

I hate the "What if Walking Dead Happens" type scenarios. I mean, really? If the Internet goes down, much of the civilized world would stop functioning full stop. If the power grid goes down gold and cash also become mostly useless, it's bread and bullets that take over as precious commodities. Imagine a civilized world with 7.5 - 8 Billion people without access to electricity. Gold may have worked in the wild west 200+ years ago but what was the total population back then? Less than a Billion most likely bet. And these were people who never had electricity or the internet to begin with. Our soft-ass bitch society would crumble, it would be chaos. Only places like the jungles of Papua New Guinea would be fine. I don't know about you, but that's the last place I would want to live.
