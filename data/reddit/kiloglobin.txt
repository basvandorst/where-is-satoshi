$60M seems so low compared to what will happen next week with futures. If anything that would be the time to pull out 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:34:37
Yeah $60M right there. Still not that much compared to 10B

This is what I’m worried about both as this case may prove and (if said case does prove) means the business operations side of NH is WAY behind where it should have been. Both, even separate, are alarming.

Hey don’t kill yourself man. Please.

Bye bye my $1,200
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:46:04
Right $60m value. Around 4,200 coins I believe

I can’t wait to setup my goTennas for this!

They work really well. I used them with my team at a nascar event earlier this year (cell service was spotty) and we were connected to each other the whole time

Yes or the device could be in relay mode in which case it's actively repeating other user's transmissions

Thanks for the tip!

haha 'or whatever'

This (increasing the dbcache) should be the default behavior of the app. Especially when starting the initial sync. Once it’s fully synced it should reduce back to the default 400MB. The speed increase for syncing a starting node is impressive.

Well also they have a platform for wallets and apps. I use Coinbase strictly for the Shift Visa Card. I have never used it to “buy” BTC. All the BTC comes from external (to Coinbase) wallets.

Honestly I don’t know. I agree that I am “spending coin” but not sure if I would owe beyond sales tax. Coinbase may as they are the provider but I really don’t know

It chooses which form to take *ONLY* when it’s converted to fiat. Otherwise it’s transient ��

Awesome thanks for helping! I freaked out for a moment when some of my addresses were listing no PK on record until I realized those were sending addresses.

Question: I've been using Bitcoin Core (QT) and have extracted all my private keys. Do I need to do anything else in prep for this hard fork?
