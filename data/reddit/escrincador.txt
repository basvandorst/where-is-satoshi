I don't see the point of using BTC in the future. Crypto environment is pretty new and there are so many coins that are more than a slow payment method or a store of value.
BTC will never be used as a worldwide payment method because of it's ridiculous confirmation time.
In 1 or 2 years other coins will become an standar. Coins that can handle thousands of transactions per second (BTC only support few) and that could offer many other useful features.

BTC is only a method of payment or store of value. And there are so many cryptocoins that are a much better and faster method of payment and many of them offer many nice features that BTC lack.
BTC is popular because it has been the first. But as a method of payment is useless in the future because nobody will be able to pay the daily  groceries. Confirmation times are a bad joke!!!!.
Can you imagine to wait 7 minutes in front of the dependent at Starbucks to pay for your cofee???

BTC doesn't have many features other crypto do have.
I don't see the point of using something that only offers you 5% of what a crypto could offer.
BTC has been the first to be know, but others like ETH are offering almost infinite capabilities in comparison to BTC.

If you compare BTC max transactions per second and transaction confirmation time agains other crypto you will begin to cry...
