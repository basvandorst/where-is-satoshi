If you don't mind waiting a bit, check out CoinDeal. It will be available in the US soon. SegWit users get a fifty percent discount on bitcoin withdrawals. Also, it has free deposits via bank transfer and is giving away free tokens that will reduce fees.

that's a good one. coindeal supports new technologies. segwit is not the only one - galaxy score for example.

Sounds like you need to make an account on a crypto exchange that offers various payment methods, just in case your bank denies your purchase. Coindeal might be the right one for you, because you can buy btc there with a credit card or via skrill, epay, etc. Once you own some btc (for example 1btc), you can exchange it to the fiat of your choice and deposit it in your bank. It sounds technical and difficult but in reality, it's fairly easy. You just need to read and learn more about crypto and blockchain.

You need to find a secure cryptocurrency exchange platform and e-wallet. For the latter, I'd go with Coinbase and as for exchanges, it's the safest one I've found so far - [ When it comes to your second question, the long term is the right way to become a happy hodler ;). And yes, you can buy fractions of Bitcoin. It doesn't have to be a full one (trust me, not a lot of hodlers can say that they own 1 BTC, it's an achievement for lots of them). Anyways, welcome to the cryptocurrency world.

Long way to go

Thanks a lot! I've seen some arguments on both subredditts but didn't know the origins. Also, I'm aware of the scam on bitcoin.com as I was reposting warnings about it the last couple of days. Once again, thank you for informing me!

Can someone, please, explain me the beef between r/Bitcoin and r/BTC?

And if you're a SegWit user you get a 50% discount on BTC withdrawals, so it's worth giving a shot.

Ok, let's starts from the beginning. 
1. CoinDeal. It's a user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platform with around 50 coins, lots of fiats and various payment methods. There are other amazing features like voting for the next crypto to be added to the platform or SegWit, but you should stick to the basics as for now.
2. As for tutorials:
a) creating an account-  [ 
b) sending funds from CoinDeal to your bank account-  [ 
But in all honesty, you don't need those tutorials, since it's extremely easy to use this exchanger.
3.  Use Galaxy Score. It's a feature that CoinDeal's users have for free. It basically tells you the condition of a coin, based on various factors. It's a great   
tool when you try to decide whether to buy, sell or hold your crypto.
Anyways, good luck with your trading :). Hope it was helpful.
