If you would like to send a different message to North Carolina legislators, that would be great!

There are two aspects of regulation at play here that are diametrically opposed: Bitcoin's legal definition of not being money vs. the state of North Carolina regulating it as money.
In short, regulators should not be able to have it both ways.
The IRS ostensibly defines Bitcoin as property, not money. The same language found in IRS guidance is used in North Carolina's H289 -- thus indicating the state's wishes to define Bitcoin in the same manner as the Feds (as non-money).
Therefore, the state of N.C. wants to have it both ways: define Bitcoin as non-money, but regulate Bitcoin processors as money transmitters.
There are other ways to regulate Bitcoin. This is the wrong way.

The bill would levy annual assessment fees on Bitcoin payments processors in North Carolina pursuant to the "Application fees and annual assessment" section at the [bottom of page 8](
If passed, Bitcoin processors would pay an annual fee of $5,000, as well as a fee based on the volume of their transactions. 
For example, a Bitcoin processor (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.) that transacts $400,000  in N.C. in one year would pay a fee of $5,000. The fee represents an overall transaction fee of 1.25% ((5,000/400,000)*100).
edit: Worse still, the annual assessment would cause substantially more harm to small startups. For example, if a small startup transacts $20,000 in North Carolina, its annual assessment would still be $5,000, which would represent a **25%** fee paid by the processor. 
It's important to keep in mind, just in general, that regulatory fees are passed onto consumers. 
The blockchain was built to transact any amount of Bitcoin, whether it be valued at $1.25 or $4.8 million, for a low network fee. This bill fundamentally changes how fees are assessed on Bitcoin transactions run through payments processors.
H289 turns Bitcoin transaction fees in N.C. from use fees to excise fees.

Coinbase supports this bill because it could eliminate their competition in North Carolina for at least a few months. Coinbase kissed the ring, and the people wearing the ring kissed back.
Pursuant to the [transition clause]( on page 16, Coinbase will ostensibly be the only Bitcoin payments processor licensed in North Carolina for several months if H289 passes.
Coinbase is [currently the only]( Bitcoin payments processor licensed in North Carolina. If other Bitcoin processors would like to apply for a license, they would not receive their licenses until next year per N.C. Banking Commission rules. 
Further, money transmitter licenses in North Carolina are a privilege, not a right. The Commissioner of Banks could deny other companies if he saw fit to do so.
Along those same lines, the Commissioner of Banks could deny Coinbase when they reapply. If he were to decide to deny Coinbase, the company would have sold out the Bitcoin industry at large in North Carolina for naught.

Sorry for the poor formatting of our new site, but this legislation just snuck up on us here in North Carolina.
If you provide your email address, it will be included in the email sent to legislators. If you don't, that's fine.
Please help by signing the letter!
