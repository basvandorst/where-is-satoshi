do the research for yourself, all of the information is available
study the post-fork PR and see the true intentions

Look, I know it's not easy to accept that your golden goose is actually a rotten egg, and choosing between helping strangers and divesting your best investment is a really tough sell.  
All I'm really trying to say is, we're all in this together, and the future is ours to make.  
The information is available and the choice is yours.

it's a good quote about putting ethics above profits, that's all.  
they trap you with your own sin to absolve themselves of karmic responsibility. that's how the game is played.

the truth is out there brother...  there is a war on for the soul and future of bitcoin.  
the controllers vs. the masses 
think about it
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:24:41
I'm not saying that fiat is good, I'm suggesting that BTC has been co-opted by TPTB control agenda and is now a highly unethical investment.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:40:44
they are purposefully crippling bitcoin so that on-chain transactions will become impractical / unusable. 
off-chain transactions: think about it what it means if a central bank holds 1M BTC and all transactions are moved to centralized secondary networks...  that is the endgame
zero transparency and total control, the anti-bitcoin...

this may help to shed some light on what's going on here

You're not wrong. In all likelihood, the other chain will continue to be attacked in every conceivable way since it is the most imminent threat to BTC.
The odds favor BTC. You will probably leave money on the table, possibly a lot of money if you bail.
I'm just trying to raise awareness of where this train is really heading. It's up to you to set your personal priorities and make your own decisions.

bitcoin is part of the system of control. every proper plan has an exit strategy.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:00:47
BTC is not free of control and manipulation, it is a tool of control and manipulation 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:55:21
think about the future rob, I know you are smart from reading your posts in r/BTC, this is about much more than profitz, this is about the future of the global financial system.  search your heart and choose wisely.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:46:53
it's a bait and switch.  they promise "freedom" but it's all about creating a new fully centralized banking system.  if the plan succeeds, many will suffer and the potential of bitcoin to shift economic power into the hands of the masses will be forever lost.
we are at a crossroads of history, but with critical thinking, awareness and conscious choices we can shape our future world.

Don't shoot the messenger just because you don't like the message

I dumped my BTC when I realized that the movement has been co-opted and would urge everyone else who believes in bitcoin to do the same
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:49:48
there is always a choice
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:29:39
Thanks for your great response. As you so rightly observe, no single entity can control Bitcoin outright. However, the market can be manipulated, sentiment can be steered, and development can be influenced through bribery and coercion. 
Keep thinking critically and you will find alternatives. Have a great week.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:34:35
BTC bigtime and possibly ETH and LTC, maybe more

the economic majority has been deceived into working against their own best interests

BTC is a conspiracy, don't support it

plenty of ways to make money bro
this is like a test of character for humanity, if people can see through the lies and overcome their own greed, then there is hope
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:52:43
That is really great, but you should still consider the big picture on where this whole thing is heading.
there are a lot of good people sucked into the scam, that's why it works. it is DESIGNED to lure in good people. this kind of manipulation has been happening for eons. 
stay objective and think critically!
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:58:12
yes, money must exist, but the purpose of bitcoin as I understand it is to level the economic playing field for all to be able to participate fairly without having their wealth siphoned off and manipulated, not to further consolidate power into the hands of the few
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:55:45
The proof is in the pudding. 
Accept no substitutes!

Permanent serfdom for the masses ushered in under the guise of "saving" the global financial system from a manufactured disaster.

You're right, I should not have brought a biblical quote into an economic discussion and that hurts my credibility.
If you are impoverished and think that BTC your ticket out then I can understand your reluctance to divest.
However, it is important to understand the underlying system and identify what it is that makes bitcoin, bitcoin.  Is it the name?  Consensus?  The devs?  The chain length?  The chain history?  The fungibility?  The chain security?  
Could a highly motivated group alter bitcoin in a malicious way toward a specific agenda and then pass it off to the vast majority of users as an upgrade?
If the goal is to reduce poverty, then we should ensure that bitcoin remains accessible and open.
