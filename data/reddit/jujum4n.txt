I got a SealswithClubs hat from you guys earlier this year it came ontime and was as expected :)
Ill add a new color Bitcoin Hat to my collection probably

My understanding is that some browsers Javascript engines have vulnerabilities (bugs) known or unknown to researchers. Using these vulnerabilities sometime people can execute code remotely on your machine, just by you loading a web-page/ad which contains the Javascript, typically it tries to deliver more complex payloads and compromise the entire machine etc.
Its safer to browse with some sort of Javascript blocking, but who knows what else is vulnerable.
Look up:  aka Remote Code Execution

Here is a start in python:
What is left todo, You need to convert each of the electrum hex seeds, to a valid Bitcoin public/private combo and verify if it == your public key, if it does == print out word1 and word2

Like Quasi pointed out the reason is for security, it is highly unlikely both of the cryptographic primitives we use would be compromised simultaneously. Having an alternative primitive allows for us to update one or both of the primitives. In the case one is broken completely we then could update clients, then send coins to new addresses utilizing new stronger cryptographic primitives.
It should be noted that when a cryptographic primitive is 'compromised' it is typically only 'weakened' meaning we just calculate it faster than we previously did. A complete compromise of a cryptographic primitive possibly denotes a mathematical breakthrough which is not all that common.

Perhaps their hope is that when sidechains are implemented, issues like blocksize would not be a problem for users. Bitcoin would remain the parent chain as is, and the pegged sidechains satisfy the use cases of needing: larger blocks, quicker block creation times, inflation, meme coins etc. anything an Altcoin has today. As Nielsen's and Moore's laws progress it might become easier for participants to agree upon raising the parent chains blocksize, but for now it certainly is not. Bitcoin was designed to be resilient to outside change.
If sidechains are not feasible, we could have the maximum blocksize recalculate every ~2016 blocks like how we recalculate blocks target difficulty. This would raise blocksize up or down based on the networks previous 2016 blocksizes. An attacker trying to enlarge/shrink blocksize would have to win the majority of the last 2016 blocks as the calculation takes these sizes into account.

Just out of curiosity why do you want to avoid Blockchain.info? In my experience, outside of setting up your own node solely to accept payments Blockchain.infos api seemed to provide one of the best experiences. I found using:   to work well for testing Bitcoin enabled web-apps. You accept payments at a new address Blockchain generates for you, then Blockchain forwards that payment to a specified address you own (Cold Storage etc.).
As long as each payment is above 0.0005 BTC they seemed to be forwarding it for free (Might have changed). I tried most every solution and this appeared to be the method with the least amount of effort/information to hook up. I don't even think I had to setup an API key/account on Blockchain.info to use this, however now it looks like it was updated to require an API key which means you need an account.

My guess, Coinbase offers an API for developers to create wallets for applications. These wallets would not be considered customers of Coinbase (I believe). So some company is using Coinbase API for wallet service and might have heated up.
I think 1 User might actually represent an application that utilizes the wallet API.

Dogecoin creator invents new type of proof, says "I see no long-term future for  or cryptocurrencies at this point". Proof of idiocy was just invented guys! Altcoin developers are good for something.

Damn.... 3271.6838 Bitcoins have been given to the 'neucoin' developers in presales for their clone coin.
Make your own Neucoin today follow these simple steps below to become an altcoin developer and cheat people out of BTC.
When will people learn that, you can program something like Neucoin in under 3 Hours. If you can't follow the guide you can just use a website to generate a coin for you...
