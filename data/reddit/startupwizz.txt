Imagine if you work all week to get paid in coins example etherium and when you get your paycheck you already lost 200 dollars from a crash. See ..
Crypto will never replace money
 Crypto started as currency for the cyberworld paid as rewards for gamers or to solve math problems Not money. I always say this crypto values will be equal to zero dollar because crypto has no money value. Coinbase should be banned and liqudated and their founders and investors should be in prison like Enron if you rember that. Only time will tell i am correct 100%

It dosent seem a crash because no bad news..all good news and yet values kept coming down because demand is evaporating..only big players and exchanges are the top winners ..and few lucky ones..But the masses are bleeding back to the poor house..I know it is not what we like to hear, but it is the harsh truth and reality, please spread the word to save some poor souls, the poors should stick together not keep making the rich and scammers richer.

Very simple supply and demand. In any market when investors dont make money they will not buy. In crypto investors especially small ones lost money so they will not buy. Unless a big whale start buying and push prices higer or stop the decline, prices will keep going down to close to zero. As I said before, crypto should have never been allowed to be traded with money. Coinbase should be banned and liqudated and money given to investors who lost money. Can you see the writing on the wall? The cryptocap is getting very low compared to close to 800 billions in January because of all FOMO who all gone and now replaced by Feer of losing everything when crypto reach true value: ZERO

Sell it is going down more ..you can buy when eth gets to 20 bucks and bitcoin to 200 ..crypto is gone ..no demand people lost money and never came back to buy..like eth founder said it may gets to zero ..only exchanges make money and wales who bought millions of coins for 50 bucks and now manipulate market to take poor people money ..sell and run away
