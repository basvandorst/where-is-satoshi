thank god. just freaked out a little because I usually buy with my card, but It has a limit and I wanted to buy more. Really hoping the dip is over and that CMC screwed everything up and that in the next 48 everything will be better :)

Stupid question, but I bought $500 worth of btc from my bank account instead of card this time, and it says i wont get it until the 13th....But, I'll still get the price of BTC I purchased today, not what it is on the 13th....but i just wont be able to access the funds till then..right?

Okay so the dip is because the CMC website took out the korean exchanges, not because of anything to fault with bitcoin. Good chance things will return to norm in the next 48. So....could this be a good time to buy the dip?1

Very true. I'm a college student getting my masters so $100-$250 isn't the world, but still means a lot haha. 
Personally, from my research, blockchain will most certainty be an imposing technology for years to come. In addition, I do believe that crypto currencies will be the future of money. Won't replace it, but will be a big player imo. Just not sure if Bitcoin is the right horse to bet on ya know?
Interesting tidbit did you know that money has been around for over a million years and we've only had FOUR systematic changes to it? 
Sticks/leaves/nuts -&gt; coins
Coins -&gt; printed money
Printed money -&gt; credit cards
Credit cards/printed money -&gt; crypto currency
Each met with a shit ton of hate with the financial elite saying it will never catch on, just like when bitcoin was announced. Makes me believe crypto currency (maybe Bitcoin) could hopefully be the next big thing.

Nah like I mentioned I'm on the tech sides of things and originally wrote the paper with the intent of explaining how crypto currencies work with Blockchain.
The more I researched the more I became interested in Bitcoin. Was going to buy a few weeks back when I started my paper and the next day it dropped to like 5k a share (I think with the china news?) So ever since then I've been kinda skeptical.

Fair point. I forgot to add that a good portion of the paper was on the technical aspect of Bitcoin and how Blockchain functions. I only touched on the business aspect of it briefly. More of an engineeting/IT guy myself and don't have the most experience in stocks and the market as others.

Buttt what about buy low, sell high?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:38:33
Well that's what I wondering haha. My hunch is that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that we are in for a wild ride. However since I just finished this massive paper, I'm probably using a good amount of conformation bias right now, so my opinion is skewed. 
Like I mentioned above I have an IT/Engineering background so I'm not the most knowledgeable on the stock market. I am interested in investing around $100 - $250 if I go through with it.
