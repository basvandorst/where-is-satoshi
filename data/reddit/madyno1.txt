Wow, 2 times home per year, that got me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:01:27
I'm here because I find it fascinating to watch what drive a community driven currency can get.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:55:33
You can use foxmixer.com or the official tor link foxmixer6mrsuxrl.onion.
Both worked well for me, never had any issues with it.

Concerning the hacking question:
You can definitely say that there are a lot of attacks on exchanges, but that is mainly due to its popularity, not necessarily due to the technology.
There might arise new altcoins and new exchanges that offer much more attack vectors than bitcoin exchanges, but they aren't exploited, because hackers don't care about it due to its current lack in popularity.
What you can say is that the bitcoin protocol / technology is quite safe, as it has proven to provide secure value transfer for almost 10 years now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:03:08
Technology isn't all, you see...
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:23:02
I'd go with slushpool, but others might be fine as well.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:52:02
It's like gambling. You can't know it. You're far better off having a normal job and not having in mind that bitcoin should become your once\-and\-forever\-get\-rich method.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:18:26
Well, it's programmable, smart is probably a bit too much, I agree.
But marketing people prefer 'smart'.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:11:30
I don't think this will help. Restriction never helps.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:04:18
Why must there be a debate about this at all? Just BTC = Bitcoin = The original cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:03:05
Whoops, you're right. The 'today' got lost. I wanted to express that starting from the current cap, it is highly unlikely we will experience such an increase.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:01:25
Ideally, you should transfer your funds to a cold storage. Just to be safe in the end..
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:33:59
In this case, it could lift the perception of complexity of bitcoin for non\-technical users.
Why not keep bitcoin simple if there are already technologies, such as Ethereum out there that adopt such advanced features.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:21:00
I think we don't need these contracts with bitcoin, neither on the main chain, nor on a side chain.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:55:51
Yes, there are always big hopes. But realistically, we would need a far higher market cap today to achieve this.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:59:44
I also used to use bitmixer. Today there are more and more fake sites. Especially sites that look like bitmixer but are operated by fraudsters.
If you don't want to go all the way with CoinJoin \(which can become cumbersome\), I can recommend Foxmixer or Grams/Helix.
Nevertheless, you should use Tor, as plain clearnet access links your coins with your IP which is just what you don't want.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:06:28
Depends also on whether the site has a license. Many sites you'll find on google lack such a license.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:49:52
Taking the age of that software, it certainly won't be efficient to use it as a mining basis. Without a lot of effort, you won't be able to get a block out of it.
Instead, you should check out more software that is made for that purpose, unleashing the full power of your GPUs.
Still, a mining pool would probably turn out more efficient in the end.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:45:46
I don't favor a development towards Etherum.
Etherum offers all that smart\-contract stuff and should be used for that, Bitcoin should remain a pure value currency as it is.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:03:31
Nobody will reveal a bot that produces profit.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:09:57
Currently, the fees are NOTHING compared to how high they were at the end of last year / beginning of this year. The lightning network already does a pretty good job and I am confident it will help a lot in facing the scaling issues. Wait for it, it will get better!
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:07:39
Congrats! Now wait and hope.
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:37:55
Yes, that's right. Although I don't assume that many banks and governments will go with bitcoin. The major actors will probably find it more attractive to start out with their own protocols and split up the crypto market further.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:11:53
I absolutely discourage the use of mixers for dnm activity, cause it also increases the likelihood that the rest of the mixing services disappear as well.
For me, Foxmixer is a viable alternative, mainly because of the predictable output amounts and the intuitive user interface. I just mixed about 14.3 btc half a month ago. Bitcoinblender was also one of the mixers I used in the past. Grams/Helix has very high fees in my op.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:14:11
What, only 3x?
I thought that would go on exponentially....
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:54:23
Haha, how true. It just how it is. Early investors take their rewards.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:12:51
That's what I call growth!
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:14:19
Seriously? Do we need this? I think there would be a dozen other opportunities that are not taken by anyone to say thank you about things that are more important than this...
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:16:09
I'm glad we don't have to talk about it. It means bitcoin became a natural mean of avoiding corrupt banking systems.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:53:15
I don't think that they will be successful with it.
The hackers will probably disappear with it...
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:10:25
Holy shit, that is awesome!!!
Let's hope it's still spinning up.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:11:33
I think the 2017 "bubble" grew in a more organic way.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:02:32
Do you need phone number?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:18:24
I absolutely agree here. How should we take the path to worldwide adoption if something like this happens?
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:00:43
I'd consider FoxMixer.com or Bitcoinblender. If you want, also use Double Mixer (pretty nice and open source) but the hassle with the setup is much higher. If it should be fast and easy there's no way around a central mixing engine.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:01:19
Time for plan B to become plan A
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:03:32
What are the fees?
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:04:28
If you want to engage an external API from a third-party service, it is surely possible. But probably not the true intention of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:02:04
Good step, that's the way we need for more adoption!
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:30:08
Without sufficient replay protection the best decision they could have made at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:35:38
It's what characterizes a fully community driven system. I love that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:10:51
i can't really believe they want to scam us...
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:07:54
Ok, glad if I could help. With Foxmixer you can also download a letter of guarantee which you should definitely do, as it is signed and therefore gives some additional security.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:10:31
Ok, yeah that $10k doesn't seem to take long anymore. But who knows.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:54:28
Actually, haven't heard of it before. Just googled it.
Found several pages accusing it to be scam:
What I personally think is quite dubious is that it offers a guaranteed return of ...% to investors. Combined with the reviews above, I personally would stay away from it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:00:28
I don't think there will be a fork. It will be realized that too many forks might destroy trust and interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:17:27
At one time, the value of one satoshi will be high enough that it should be divisible, which will sadly not be possible...
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:10:12
It's just fantastic!!
Such a great rise.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:14:51
There are a lot of scams arising these days, especially after the closedown.
Always use small amounts first, to make sure the mixer is trustworthy. Personally, I prefer FoxMixer or Bitcoinblender.
Especially pay attention to sites that look like Bitmixer, most of them are scams.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:05:13
Some will ask: What does that freaky orange sign mean? I would have bought your garage, but that makes me doubt if I should do it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:48:14
Cool video
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:49:05
OK, and the miner is running on the navigation system electronics? Mining coins while driving?
That'd be great, cause you don't need extra electricity.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:00:13
Would not have believed this if you told me at the beginning of 2017
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:08:52
It won't disappear, as long as there are nodes running and people wanting to buy it.
It's the more general question if it turns out to be only a hype. Then you might be right.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:49:36
And not managed by any authority.
Entirely community driven.
Communities are always stronger than individuals.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:45:44
Who is surprised by this?
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:43:59
And the sad truth is, that banks try to fight against it by forcefully trying to create their own "managed" cryptocurrencies, neglegcting the fact that the purpose of a cryptocurrency is its decentral value storage.
Just like some post offices tried to create their own email services which failed miserably...
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:45:55
As soon as you start building such a service, you will realize that you will get more and more like Coinbase.
Not because you want to, but because regulations force you.
That's how it is.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:43:58
Super. Do your next buy early to be cost efficient ;)
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:04:39
Sounds reasonable. Observing the current development, a $50k goal doesn't seem unrealizable.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:42:07
That's the basic insight on which click-baiting companies build their work upon.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:51:47
Think about the worth of paper money. It's more money around than worth behind.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:58:56
OMG, I would rather not have any Btc than knowing that I had some and not being able to remember the pin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:59:11
yep, that's what I assume as well
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:58:30
And what's left? Any alternatives?
I only know about Foxmixer (foxmixer.com) and Bitcoinblender.
