I use it to save money on Amazon with Purse.io at this present time.

It's western media's fault. They have huge control and influence over mainstream. They love negative stories. They never studied the technology.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:01:49
Again, everybody always thinks about their countries (USA or England)...the question is...will ApplePay take off in Vietnam? Philippines? Bosnia? No. 
Bitcoin has a better chance of making it in countries that have little or no access to credit card companies.

That's awesome news! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:50:42
I'm glad to see this.
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:59:16
Awesome! I just bought 14 slices!
@_date: 2015-05-10 14:35:50
Best wallet on iOS hands down!
@_date: 2015-08-14 03:17:25
The two best wallets by far on iOS are CoPay &amp; Breadwallet! 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:44:23
Copay and Breadwallet are the top ones for mobile.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:30:01
1) Developing countries have access to mobile phones, but not much access to traditional financial services. Take a look at Kenya - they don't even use their currency. They actually use a mobile phone provider's service M-Pesa to conduct their daily business.
2) I believe Gordon is willing to accept bitcoin through a merchant service provider like BitPay which will automatically convert the bitcoin to U.S. Dollars. This way he allows another payment network to be utilized in the city. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:32:54
The ledger is 6 years in that it would take more than the top 5 supercomputer's to take control of the network at this point....and a lot of money. Satoshi Nakamoto thought this through a long time ago and noticed that he or she would give an incentive to play fair by releasing bitcoin every 10 minutes. So it would be foolish to waste trillions of dollars to "try" to destroy the network when in fact you could help keep it even more secure.

I love me some Bread Wallet - 0 confirmation spending! I tend to go to an ATM to buy some BTC and then I order myself a coffee at the same time. I don't have to wait around for a confirmation before I can spend. Very convenient :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 01:06:08
It doesn't matter of Jesus Christ himself blessed those chips...it's still a pull account and the hackers love it :)
@_date: 2015-04-03 09:02:06
Thank you! 😀
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:26:59
I'll be honest with you. Nobody even knows who the Bitcoin Foundation are - I'm talking mainstream media. And they don't really care. It's the truth. Bitcoin lives on either way.
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:14:58
Tipping can be tough with the volatility. I've sent tips before in the past, the next few days we had the flash crash, and their money was worth less. :(
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:35:30
Yes, I believe so. It will be the engine.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:33:06
Karpeles used bots to pump the price at $1000 to cover losses. Now that Wall Street is in the game along with "real" CEOs, it certainly has potential to gain steam down the road.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:20:40
I meant that you still have your information attached to your card which can be pulled. It's not a push mechanism.

If you're here to get rich then you don't truly understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:18:20
Yes, Venmo, Square Cash, and PayPal seem easier because they are attached the old financial system. Remember, Bitcoin is something entirely new and does not rely on a bank. It has its own unit of account. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:30:01
You're welcome! (I don't actually work for them, but figured I would step up for them) :-)
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:44:01
Unfortunately, that's normal. It's always the same faces at the conferences, too.
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:52:03
@_date: 2015-04-21 00:44:38
That's only a Bread Wallet thing - as far as I know. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:41:06
What happens if nobody wants to buy their bitcoins?  Does that force them to keep them?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:18:47
I called and it's valid.  The lady on the phone seemed pretty excited. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:30:20
And the amateurs downvoting are the ones fucking up Bitcoin. I'm glad Wall Street is involved now. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:04:49
How do you feel about the BitLicense? Any thoughts on what you could do with bitcoin and the blockchain at a local level?
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:03:08
One of the reasons I stopped using Breadwallet.  I always had to rescan the blockchain.  I would recommend BitWallet or Airbitz.
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:02:34
That was amazing!  
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:46:34
BitWallet for iOS.  Mycelium for Android.  MultiBit for PC.  Breadwallet is good, but I always have a syncing issue which makes me upset if I need to pay something retail.  And AirBitz requires a username and password which I hate having to input every time I want to spend a mere $3...otherwise, it's decent.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:17:51
That is stupid.  CoinDesk is part of our industry.  They should be accepting Bitcoin from Day 1!  Heck, my coffee shop accepts it, but my Bitcoin news source doesn't? 
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:49:49
Unfortunately, many companies and people have fake followers.  You can tell by their Retweet and Fav percentage.  If you have 10,000+ followers and you get 3 retweets...some even zero...it's truly sad.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:35:14
Impossible to find out.  
@_date: 2015-03-29 12:31:54
Bitcoin is a 50/50 shot. It's either going to fly or drop. If you have money sitting around that you can afford to lose then buy. If not, stop.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:24:33
Yes, once more people use it to buy goods instead of saving.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:07:39
Reread the post.  In general, the Chinese are smarter than us.  Hell, they own most of the U.S. because they outsmart us.
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:59:16
It is impossible for the price to reach $0 due to loss coins - people forgetting their private key, losing password, etc. 
Satoshi once said, "Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone."
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:25:36
Obviously, you do not understand chance. It's either going to make it big or not. That's 50/50. I'm as Greek as Antonopoulos and he would surely agree.
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:40:10
I have family there and I know there were a few Bitcoin ATMs set up in popular spots during the crisis.  I'm not sure if their there today though.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:04:56
You lied to the state :( Apple, Amazon, Victoria's Secret....they do not accept Bitcoin!...maybe through a gift card purchase, but not directly.  He should have started with the big guys: Microsoft, Dell, Dish, Overstock, Newegg, United Way, American Red Cross...
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:33:23
I'm happy that I can go through Coinbase and not deal with these problems.  They can verify me all they want because 1) I don't do anything illegal 2) They don't care about me because I'm not buying over $10,000 bitcoins at a time 😄
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:53:03
Those Chinese are smart business people.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:39:25
Well, she certainly needs a makeover.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:53:55
I agree.  I purchased an Xbox One from New Egg on Black Friday because they had the best offer when paid in Bitcoin.  If they didn't have that special promotion then I would have probably settled with Target.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:40:02
It was a joke.  Americans are too sensitive.  That's why our country is so "edited."  Now I know how the great Bill Maher feels.  
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:09:40
Actually he is quite smart and uses his free speech.  You must be a Republican.  Go watch Fox News.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:51:39
Was there ever an Internet Foundation?
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:04:11
No.  He defends black people all the time.  He is very fair.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:16:54
You just won his case!  Great find!

Yes, Tipping Tuesday!  I forgot it was Tuesday....
