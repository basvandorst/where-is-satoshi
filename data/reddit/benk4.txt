I fortunately realized my mistake and got back in at $5k!
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:51:46
Lol true.  I originally bought around $100 and continued to buy up through 1k.  So I'm still very much in the black

I came to see bitcoin news.  Now all I want to talk about is shelter pets 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:26:02
Ain't that the fucking truth?  I sold most of mine when it hit $2k so I could buy the dip.  Really regretting that one.

$3? The fees will kind of eat you up there. I'd do a larger transfer less often. You gotta strike a balance between doing a cost average and paying fees...

Didn't know that Overstock took BTC!  I just bought some new shoes from them and paid in it.  I was gonna use Amazon.

All you can do is stop using Apple products.  It's obviously not going to be the end of Apple, but even a small dent in their user base hurts their bottom line enough to make this a terrible decision for them.

That's the whole damn point.  Once the average Wal-Mart user knows what bitcoin is we're in good shape
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:50:41
Yeah I buy $25 worth every Monday. That way I cost average them so I get more when they're cheap.

That's the thing I never should have sold.  Fucking magic cards.  Sold my power abd dual lands about 13 years ago for a couple grand total.  Got back into the have and they had gone up 5-10 fold.

Well to be fair this dude wasn't at citi until 2010.  
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:25:33
That's fine for now though.  Businesses accepting bitcoin is one of the first steps to getting people using it.  If bitcoin takes off and becomes more stable businesses may start keeping it and actually conducting business with it.
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:00:01
Same reason they do it in US Dollars now.   It's the easiest and most stable currency.
It's a long way off, but certainly possible.

Honestly yes.  I think so.  I've been buying monthly since 2013.  At one point I was disappointed I had bought at $1000.  I think the term is dollar cost averaging.  Just keep buying regularly.
@_date: 2015-04-02 01:54:47
As is tradition. 
Edit: thanks for the gold! I didn't think I was THAT clever. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:40:18
I wish there was a "no" option.
@_date: 2015-09-25 06:54:33
Lol, I've never heard that one. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:54:08
Yep I just sold some.  I'm expecting a slump so I'll rebuy then
@_date: 2015-10-24 05:50:23
The fact that they're going to these lengths to destroy privacy is chilling in itself. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:35:34

Even though they're idiots I still sympathize with people who lost their house and family over it, and anyone considering suicide should definitely call the hotline.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:53:34
I just bought more.  Buy low sell high right?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:52:36
Half this subreddit has 10 BTC?  I'm certainly not holding 10 grand in bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:58:01
Yeah they're showing typical behavior buy high expecting it will go higher, sell low expecting it will go lower.  Right now is the time to buy!
I've been doing the dollar cost average over the last few months on it.  I just buy $25 worth once a week.  Also when there's a significant dip I drop another $25 in at the low price.
