Well it was all sold off at once in just a few sell orders. I mean it could have just as well been a group of people, but it didn't look like it.

I'll try. Even if I have to correct myself...it's hard being a grammar Nazi on my mobile...

Way past that and well would you look at that! It hasn't failed yet! 
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:27:52
I think that went out of the window with BFL. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:04:43
Well really the past few days it has been due to big dumps by what seems to be one guy. He sold of 5K+ in about 15 minutes yesterday morning. Taking the price from $607 to $563 in a matter of minutes. It was fun to watch the buy orders being knocked out like BAM BAM BAM!
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:05:46
Uhh. Would it not be randomly generated? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:52:11
You're response is no better than theirs...
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:30:52
I made a joke...you we're posting business links to get your name out there out of the blue...It would be better if you made a post about it. Also the site looks good, but it doesn't properly user the space it's given. Too much white space.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:47
No, but you don't make comments like that...

It was $560 just 10 minutes before and it was $550-55 this morning. Someone bought 1.2K all at once and knocked out every sell order, price rised. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:43:37
Still nowhere near 1/1000th of a penny.
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:39:40
Well then their feet are gonna get soaked. Buy them some new shoes ya old man.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:54:50
Yes that is correct. Until you sell them, they are considered "fake internet money" by the IRS.
@_date: 2014-03-17 06:12:32
A whole 1 Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:51:28
Oh I was just saying that price if the guy dumping the coins needed the money instantly. Like in minutes, which I think $400 bitcoins would be bought up pretty fast...
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:13:56
Doesn't this number include wallets without any Bitcoins in it? Also, [Coinbase stores 97% of their coins offline as cold storage in safety deposit boxes around the world]( Everything is AES-256 encrypted [It would take more computation power than there exists in the universe to break an AES-256 key...] and copied to paper backups. 
I think your coins are safe with them, but you should still be storing them locally [offline, not exactly locally] even if their storage method is probably safer than yours.... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:14:43
Oh my bad, I thought you replied to a different comment...apparently I'm not good at following the lines in RiF [Reddit is Fun]...
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:31:06
It was a very heart felt response. It was awesome. 
Now time to go to bed kids! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:18:24
Yes, there is a bright side!
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:48:11
Reddit fuzzing algorithm will start to fuck with that number then...
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:40:51
What? Is it not true that any currency can be used for illegal methods? Anything with value can be used for illegal methods...what are you getting at?
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:41:50
Stop drinking water then. Everyone who drinks water dies, ya know?
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:20:51
I'm not even remotely talking about mining Bitcoin over Altcoins...lol. I was just saying altcoin miners rejoice because GPU mining for Bitcoin is idiotic...
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:13:47
Unless you're mining with GPU's..[Gaming PC vs. Space Heater Efficiency]( Alt-coin miners rejoice in the warmth I guess?
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:07:29
I like it. It has a friendly look to it that promotes use of the app. It gives the transaction list a comfortable feeling :) 
Also I'm sorry, but it's typeface mate!
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:54:15
That would be cool, but I'm not sure you can make the whole trip with only BTC. I would cary maybe 75/25. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:10:56
Yeah, but everyone who eats food also dies. It's a lose lose situation.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:34:36
This is not the time to joke...these kinds of losses are things people take their lives over...if you don't have the decency to say something nice then don't say anything at all. I expect more of the Dogecoin community.
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:12:42
Actually when comparing a [Gaming PC vs. Space Heater Efficiency]( the Gaming PC was just as efficient at heating a room compared to a space heater. Although mining with a setup like this is idiotic, it's still quite interesting. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:14:15
Sorry, that wasn't meant to come off as harsh. I know everyone knows that...I was stating that I never brought up whether ASIC mining Bitcoin is worse than GPU mining Alt-coins.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:57:10
Are you really taking this seriously? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:29:25
Uhmmm no...

@_date: 2014-04-14 05:34:37
Have you posted this comment elsewhere? I could have swore I read this before...
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:55:56
Good point. But really Vertcoin like litecoin was only created so GPU .miners could make a profit. I think it might have bright future ahead of it, but for the wrong reasons. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 13:06:03
This feels like De Ja Vu...long post questioning something, then a long comment quoting stuff and calling the OP out on things...now we just wait to see if OP has sources to back it up, if they don't, then I foresee a long quote war...
I do know quite a few of these things are true, OP just needs to post the links :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:37:34
I thought so. Wouldn't it be better to sell at say $400? Surely you would sell out very fast maybe even as fast since most don't have buy orders that low. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:36:37
Only .1 for the whole trip? That's not very much...

Yes. K rape me. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:12:59
I wonder what he has in mind...I'd be interested to hear what he thinks it would be. Did he add anything onto this statement?
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:11:55
Well no shit the difference is less than a penny, we are talking about fractions of pennies...
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:48:12
So what would do you think they were trying to enter? $1000 maybe?
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:38:35
Okay sure...yeah that's how it works...
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:20:37
20 BTC to be exact. It was calculated to be worth $4680 at the time. [Link.](
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:13:58
That could work. I would just check if shops in that area generally accept Bitcoin. Maybe ask on this sub.
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:46:34
Yes. Reading that edit made me laugh.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:57:37
Well anything is possible...you could have mined with a shitty laptop cpu back then.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:14:36
Well for starters, identification and verification processes. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:42:11
Dogecoin has pretty equal distribution of wealth on the other hand. Although the top wallets are kinda excluded since they are mostly cold storages for exchanges and the owner of scryptpools...
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:13:34
The homepage of that site used 1/6 of my monitors real-estate...*great design...*
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:53:11
Yeah that's probably a better term.
