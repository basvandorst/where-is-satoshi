When bitcoin is common-place foolproof and effortless backups of wallets will probably be too. But sure, as long as it's even remotely possible to lose wallets, when time approaches infinity the number of accessible Bitcoins will approach zero.

If they care about Bitcoin they probably realize that a level playing field is required for network security. Attackers would probably have the ability to create these and destroy the network, if every miner has these, an attacker couldn't do much without more sophisticated hardware. The demand for their products (or, if mining, the value of their return) depend on Bitcoins survival.

Just a heads up: I've had very bad experiences with syncing truecrypt containers to dropbox, much of the time the container didn't sync properly. A script that gpg encrypts the wallet after doing the rpc backupwallet command and puts it in the dropbox folder would work much better.

One thing that made me wonder, was that guy who semi-ignorantly asked how much bandwidth mining uses because *"he's been working on a super computer that he will have access to for a while before shipping to the customer"* or something similar. Apparantly he knew enough about computers to work on a super computer, why would he even have to ask?
The ASIC chips are to be shipped in October (or November or something), meaning that it's basically now and a couple months more and pretty much never again if someone were to computationally attack Bitcoin.
I couldn't interpret the super-computer post in any other way than *"Don't worry if a single entity suddenly has 51% of the network, it's just me and my super computer, definitely nothing else, I promise. Use my post as a source in case panic ensues."*
@_date: 2012-06-09 17:06:41


This should definitely be prioritized if it's not already a standard feauture in miner software, because I'd imagine this could become a real problem and it's fairly trivial to solve.
Satoshidice does well stretching the limits of the networks. How many transactions would an attacker have to do to severely hinder legitimate transactions, and what would that cost? I'd imagine it wouldn't really cost much? I think work has been done in regards to effective scaling.

If everyone paid the recommended transaction fee, even now the fees would total at 3 per block. Let's say transactions increased 20-fold, we'd have 60 btc per block, or an equivalent depending on value. Miners could refuse to process transactions if they don't profit from them, leading to fees adjusting depending of supply and demand.

Almighty Satoshi thought of everything. You appear to be well-versed in the code and I noticed in your comment history that you suggest that Satoshi is actually a group; have you perhaps noticed any "grammatical" differences between sections of the original code that could further strengthen that hypothesis?
The Bitcoin protocol/reference implementation can be compared to a masterful piece of art that appears more elegant and ingenious the longer you scrutinize it. Amazing.

Since the routing constantly changes and other people use the same exit nodes you wouldn't be able to link it with my other unencrypted traffic; so you'd never know I both have a dog with fever and a cat with the flu, nor that I wasn't the one searching for horse constipation, losing your ability to narrow things down further. ;)

I don't think more stuff is needed as much as some program that bluescreens your computer when you try to buy something with fiat currency that can be bought with bitcoins. It would say something like 
"Dude, you can buy this *and* support the Bitcoin economy. Press any key to be redirected to 
Seriously though, some effortless way to be notified, maybe a browser extension or something. I'd throw away my shitty fiat currency if my phone beeped and opened an online bitcoin candy store whenever I entered a kiosk. I wouldn't even mind if a paper clip told me.

You have some great points I had not considered before. I believe, however, that while all metals have unique properties this is not what primarily gives silver its value (if it were so it'd decrease in price during recessions due to less industrial demand, but since it's primarily a store of value it increases).
If it was used for backing currencies, the industrial demand would be a tiny tiny fraction, the rest of the demand (read: price) would be determined by its function as a currency, not different from fiat currency.
I can't really think of any object where intrinsic value would still be relevant (not miniscule) when primarily sought after as currency/value storage, but it's probably not silver.

Hopefully you keep a backup, but essentially it's the same as actual cash (except you can't backup dollars). Electrum and some other wallet softwares use deterministic key generation, meaning a single backup will contain all future addresses too.

Silver has practically no intrinsic value. Sure, it's useful in some manufacturing, but compare it to other metals and you'll find that it would be bizarrely overvalued if it was valued on those terms only. Left is the widely accepted (wanted) part. Futhermore, a single asteroid brought to Earth for its minerals (could happen even in 15 or 20 years) or a large new unexpected find could wreck the scarcity over night.
Bitcoin and the network it relies on, on the other hand, is the fastest and cheapest way to transfer value globally ever invented; that in itself is intrinsic value. It's decentralized and pretty much beyond the control of governments or individuals, that too is valuable. The countless future possibilities of the protocol leaves room for even more intrinsic value.

Profit would probably be very high for a while with break-even in weeks, but when the difficulty adjusts to ASIC being commonplace the profitability wont be extreme anymore, still very profitable though. If you google bitcoin mining calculator you can play around a bit with the numbers and make educated guesses on values.

The only way to prevent capitalism (i.e. the right to make transactions freely, right to private property) is to have a totalitarian anti-capitalist state monitoring finance. Imo Bitcoin is pretty much inherently incompatible with anti-state anti-capitalism.

Not sure those are chips, a bit below it another thing is hanging over the border; maybe those are connectors? The bottom would then be for power, the big thingie almost covering it would then be some PSU or something. The leds would then be visible between the power and USB (?) connector on the casing. Makes sense to me.
@_date: 2012-06-12 16:02:07
But the price is also directly correlated to the supply, so the block reward decrease shouldn't really have any large long term effect on the hashing power?
@_date: 2012-06-14 10:52:23


Yup, that's how markets work, if someone can do something with smaller margins they've found a niche. Rejecting low-fee transactions would force users to add a fee if they want a transaction processed in a reasonable time. If a group decided to do lots of transactions without a fee miners could decide they'd rather do nothing at all than waste their money on electricity without return. If miners rejected transactions they couldn't profit from the minimum acceptable fee would automatically adjust according to supply and demand.

Exponential growth is basically incomprehensible to humans without doing a calculation. Currently there's exponential growth in energy use, population, computing power per dollar, the US economy, Internet traffic, et cetera. Exponential growth will fuck your shit up and you wont know what hit you.
