The system isn't 100% dedicated to bitcoind (also runs Digiguide on WINE) but I would expect this to be &gt;98% bitcoin

My (Debian) full node is currently using 115.7GB for storage of blocks, 2.1GB for chainstate.
Obviously that's growing pretty fast, so I wouldn't recommend setting up without adequate free space for growth - but your headline numbers are not accurate.  
RAM requirements similarly overstated - "GB would work OK on Linux, though more is better

You are far too exposed to risk. Even A Antonop repeats the mantra "bitcoin is an experiment - don't bet what you can't afford to lose".
Keep believing, but diversify NOW 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:13:23
Someone (a BTC-friendly mining operation) needs to actively sabotage Antpool's sabotage. 
They could do this, when the next BCH +300% difficulty reset occurs, by mining just enough blocks to prevent EDA from setting in. 
With no EDA, it remains completely uneconomical to mine BCH, and it dies.

SSD is an mSATA / spinning rust *just* fits in but working faultlessly for well over a week now - see detailed comment (Amazon.co.uk) by CreosoteChris (4  Jan)
As a Linux newbie, I'm really proud of my achievement, I've learned lots and I'm running a full node (with 8333 open)   
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:32:45
I think you've missed out something - the current full blockchain is over 100GB, the 120GB SSD can't possibly be 13% full
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:06:19
I have a very similar setup using a Braswell fanless mini / 8GB / 120 SSD + 2TB Internal 9mm HDD..... works a treat, also enough horsepower to give me a platform for learning some Linux stuff as it does its node stuff

The "Swiss bank in your pocket" metaphor has been used on various occasions by Andreas Antonopolous - makes me wonder if Obama has been watching his vids - but trying to turn around the concepts to fit his (Obama's) mainstream worldview

Reading the story, GMO is claiming substantial efficiency improvements (in terms of hashpower per unit electricity consumed) as compared to Bitmain's Antminer S9s.
If true this could be a game-changer for mining decentralisation, going a long way towards breaking Jihan's de-facto stranglehold.
(However, chip manufacture has a long lead-time, so unless I'm mistaken that won't be anytime soon)
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:08:58
I'm no big expert on the subject, but I believe that many alts use a continuous-adjust mechanism, and that the BTC 2k block interval is widely regarded as a bug that needs to be remediated.

There's been a limited amount of BCH minimg at a loss - but the majority of miners have been mining for profit, and explicitly gaming the BCH EDA to maximise their returns.
Co-ordinating the activities (amongst competitors) and sustaining enough losses to actually cause a "flippening" looks extremely unlikely to me.
Think back to Aug 19th when Roger and Jihan did a massive price pump, co-ordinated with use of the EDA, to starve BTC of hashpower and precipitate a flippening. It came nowhere near doing so successfully, its proponents were delusional dreamers. 
Ditto S2X

The BCH Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) was such an attack - causing BTC block times to lengthen dramatically / mempool to fill up / fees to increase heavily. The BCH community saw this as a way to make BTC unusable, and drain the value into BCH. 
Ultimately, this failed to happen, but it was significantly damaging, at least for a time. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:38:57
If the recent BCH shenanigans have shown us one thing it's that *mining must be a lot more decentralised to prevent abuse and manipulation of bitcoin*. 
Additionally, the core devs need to code up a mechanism for continuous (or very frequent) difficulty adjustment - the current two-week-ish timeframe  is an attack vector. 
If the difficulty adjusted in real time, it wouldn't matter if 90% of miners suddenly defected to B2X or some other shitcoin, we could leave them to throw their money into a bottomless abyss, and carry on regardless.

Agree with OP on this subject, all the explanations I've heard so far are unconvincing. I find this really mysterious (and also somewhat disturbing)
The drop in SW percentage makes the BTC chain more vulnerable to spam / "dust" transaction attacks, more vulnerable to lost hash-rate when S2X for occurs, and no-one seems tom understand what's happening.     
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:00:17
I expect that reality will bite hard before they actually get to follow through on the intentions stated in the blog post 
1. How will they actually manage the cut-over - when BTC suddenly becomes a completely different coin – all their trading will have to stop, all their customers will have to be made aware, otherwise utter chaos, lawsuits, etc., will ensue.  The amount of work and risk-managed change activity they need to complete in a big hurry is really frightening.
2. What happens if the majority chain switches due to reallocation of hash power? 
GOTO 1    
The stated intention is a hare-brained, ill-thought-out scheme, and getting it wrong involves huge financial losses. Even getting it right is going to be very expensive when the engineering and inescapable downtime are factored in. They will reconsider before actually following through, because if they don’t they are Darwin-Award stupid.

There already has been  a drop - ATH was over 5900. I expected it to drop further 12 hours ago, but the weakness didn't materialise...
...truth is that BTC is full of surprises, and asking random strangers on the Internet for advice on price movements is extremely unreliable.
You could try watching the YouTube vids of someone like Tone Vays - but generally the advice is this. Get in soon because the medium/long trend is aggressively up. If you buy and lose 20% a day later, HODL for a few weeks and your losses will be wiped out.

Lee will definitely collect, and get lots of satisfaction from doing so. He is resolutely opposed to BCH / S2X and want to see them fail. 
Moreover, he's already agreed to donate his winnings to the Litecoin Foundation IIRC - he will come out of it with "white knight" reputation enhanced. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:56:55
Looks that way - it's rather telling that only a couple of weeks ago, he was openly stating that he supported the S2X hard fork because it would give him more coins to trade for BCH 
He appears to be throwing his BCash disciples under the bus now, whatever next?

The attack was carried out by cybercriminals who wish to enrich themselves by accumulating value from their illegal activities.
It's slightly surprising that they don't use a privacy-based coin for their demands - but think about it. They are dealing with victims who have barely heard of Bitcoin, never mind even more obscure altcoins. The criminals actually want to get paid, and make it relatively easy for the victims to come up with payment. They are balancing privacy against accessibility.  
Claiming that this was an attack on Bitcoin is paranoid nonsense. The price went down because it was overbought, because smart players were taking profits, etc. Investing 101
