Universal basic income is stupid. Socialism is great until you run out of everyone else’s money.

Coinbase jerked me around for almost a month over a year ago trying to verify my identity. Screw them. I have deposited fiat but then my account became stuck where I couldn’t buy bitcoin to extract it or withdraw Fiat. Pissed me off.

I honestly believe it will come down close to $3k. Too much support at that level and not enough volume to keep it where it’s at now. Good chance to hit 2,800 level before correction is finished.

Hey, I bought in like a noob at 15k in November of last year. Yes, my portfolio is way down, just like everyone else’s compared to then. But you know what? I would not have it any other way. If I had waited, I never would have found some of the awesome people and projects along the way. And yes, crypto is a cycle and does not behave like anything else out there. Get in now while the price is good ( hey anything under 4K is good in the big picture). And as others said, get your feet wet with $100, learn and build your knowledge of DYOR ( Do Your Own Research). Get information from multiple sources, and don’t believe everything you hear. 
ps- Don’t FOMO :)

Let the bull trap keep going. Yes, it could run up to 4,200-4,300, but more likely, it’s just ultimately headed back down to 3k or 2,800. Bottom is still coming....

Just shows it’s all about market manipulation. Big money does not want it to find its happy place price wise. It will soon, but not before profit takers get their share along the way.
