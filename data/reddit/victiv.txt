As the title says, we've launched a new daily fantasy football platform.  Daily fantasy sports is a new version of fantasy sports that compresses traditional season long leagues into just one day or week.
We are accepting traditional credit cards, PayPal, and Bitcoin.... and Bitcoin is dominating right now.
We're running a 100% up to $1,000 deposit bonus, $4,000 in free contests, and $15k in guaranteed contests for our launch promotions.
Coinbase has helped us integrate this payment option.  Bitcoin thus far has been incredibly easy and exciting.
We wanted to thank the Bitcoin community for their support, and if there's interest, run a special Bitcoin titled freeroll for next week's games to bring even more attention to that as a deposit / withdrawal option.

Sure, I'll try and answer this as best as possible:
We've had 5 figure sums deposited on the website since we launched Monday night (~2 days go).  Around 62% is being done via Bitcoin vs CC &amp; PayPal, including 1 transaction that's 7x larger than it's nearest credit card deposit.

Hi, the definition of skill based games is one where the outcome is determined predominantly by mental or physical skill vs. chance. Much discussion has occurred around this very discussion, especially when involving the game of poker.
For fantasy sports and Victiv.com, we've specifically received a carve-out for our contest type in the 2006 UIGEA.  However, each state has their own take on skill-based gaming.
We've engaged with Paul Hastings LLP out of Washington D.C. to guide us in keeping abreast of the regulatory environment.  They walk through both a federal and state-by-state analysis for us of the games we are currently running and the games we plan to run in the future.
Ultimately, we accept players from all 50 states OTHER THAN Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, and Washington + Canada OTHER THAN the providence of Quebec.

Hi platonicgap, no issues from our side.  Are you still showing server errors?

We currently offer withdrawals in Bitcoin, PayPal, or Check.

Yes, we process withdraws in bitcoin.  Players can choose to withdraw winnings through whichever means they prefer; however, we first refund the depositing method up to the deposit amount.
So for example, if you deposit $200 with your VISA and then withdraw $300 from your Victiv account, $200 will go back to your VISA and $100 will go to the method of your choosing.  We're required to do this by our processing and banking partners to ensure we fall within their anti-money laundering requirements.

Yes, we have STATS feeds for NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, MLB, NCAAF, and NCAAB.  However, the NCAA sports will likely come next year.


We will be doing daily cashout runs at start.  Depending on the cashout method, the process can be instant on that run (Bitcoin, PayPal) or 2 - 3 days (snail mail check).


Those FB and Twitter should be linked, where do you see them not?  Yes, we're currently  and 


None of our employees or their families are allowed to play on our website.  Everyone here has signed confidentiality agreements regarding the rosters and lineups that are submitted to the website, whether they have access to the information or not.  Additionally, we've put in security measures to block access to the production rosters database until the contests are live to further ensure the protection of our users rosters.
We do not employ shills, props, or sponsored players.


This is intentional and is part of our welcome email and our promotions page:
We're in the midst of updating the logged out pages to assist us in making the content dynamic so that we can further push these.  We will be running GPs next week(s); however, we've yet to decide the buyin / guaranteed amounts.  We're still in the trial phase, so will be switching some things up to see what's working best.
Any other questions, don't hesitate to drop us a line at support
