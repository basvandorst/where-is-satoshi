Actually the blockchain and the network is the bank -- all you have is a private key. Protect it, and your account is safe forever. Lose it, and anyone on the planet can access your money.

A prerequisite for a successful mining operation right now is to have access to either free or extremely cheap electricity.

Miners never take capacity offline since the hardware is a sunk cost. And newer cheaper ASICS platforms are constantly being manufactured so cash rates tends to increase no matter what

Bitcoin has a market capitalization of around $4B - not a problem to absorb $500k per day in power costs. Even a modest level of investor interest in new coins can easily cover that. Even if Bitcoin only rose at the level of the S&amp;P 500, that would be about $400M per year of dollar infusion v/ $180M per year of outlays. Over the past 4 years, Bitcoin has actually grown much *faster* than the S&amp;P 500. Only a fool would look at the past 12 months as representative you need to look at 2009 - present.

The underlying tech is 100% secure. If you use a Trezor, nobody will ever still your Bitcoin unless they physically force you to send it to them at the point of a gun. Now if you use a wallet on a machine that is connected to the internet, and love to download random software, then you essentially have no security - bitcoin can't protect you from bad security practices which result in a compromise of your hardware.
