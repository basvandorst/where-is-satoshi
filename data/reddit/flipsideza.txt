How exactly will this happen? Curious about what exactly occurs during a fork...

So guessing this will also happen on sites like blockchain.info? Unless I get the private keys?

Great so I have my 12 word seed backed up nice and tight. So I should be all good then. Going to go log in and make sure its all still correct. Thanks

Has it seriously forked? When &amp; how did I miss this?

I understand that, ultimately if you follow the 'fractional reserve banking' logic back far enough, there is no real value to the physical USD note either. Its perceived value isn't it?

Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I must do more research on this 'private key' side of bitcoin to better understand it.
Direct phone to phone transfers would be a lot safer, however in the developing world such as Africa the smart phone is not as common as you would think, much more common are the older nokia's, blackberries and now feature phones... and data bundles are not that cheap either.

Yup, BitPesa is a good start... amazing how many fringe technologies have appeared to service the African market.

Think its the global political shitstorm... investors looking for a new/better options.
