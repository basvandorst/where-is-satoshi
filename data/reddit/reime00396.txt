Very true. Even if it wasn't I could not see the BTC community doing any sort of bail out whatsoever.

A redneck market who have not heard of Bitcoin. Getting the message out to everyone is a good thing. BTC is universal.

I suffered a similar taking of my coins. Completely my fault. I accessed my web wallet from a friend's computer. My friend did not have adequate virus protection. I was unaware of the key logger virus. Didn't even think about it. 2FA was not activated. So poof...some jerk weed from California took my coins. Completely my fault...Learned a lot since then. Armory is the way to go for me. 2FA on everything I can too.

Proud constitutional, capitalist freedom loving Christian here. Don't think politics matters one bit with this technology. Going to be great to see it grow. Best wishes to everyone in their pursuits.

Probably, but it is watched by a lot of people. How better to get that B symbol out there. It will certainly generate lots of interest. I can just see the orange car with a big B on the hood surrounded by all of the addresses of those who donated. no other sponsors needed.

Honestly I believe anyone using a non-US currency would have to understand price fluctuations. If I paid you in Euros, and wanted a cash refund and the exchange rate of Euros diminished, I would receive the value based on the spot price. Plus all the conversion fees involved. I would think if the policy explaining spot price conversions were put up front and stated clearly people using a non-US currency would understand. If you lived in a country where the primary currency was BTC then I would think the issue of returns in actual BTC paid would apply.

Why not both? Motorcycles too. big orange racing cars and bikes everywhere with the big B on it.

Why not let people buy and sell tickets like tokens among one another. For example, I bought a ticket to Chicago, but a change in plans prevents me from going. Why can't I sell it to another person? Just like transferring ownership of a token. The big problem is knowing your flyer with secured identity. Obviously you don't want a bunch of unknown people getting tickets who may have destructive motives. So why not work on developing a market place for previously purchased tickets whereby the identity of the participants can be confirmed, and secured, with a BlockChain ID system. That would be pretty cool.

Futures based success of education methods. Incorporating data from schools, student backgrounds, and grades, a best case method scenario could be developed to forecast potential success or failure of teaching methods or subject matter.

Medical diagnosis and treatment. If your application could be developed to bring together physicians, and incorporate different illnesses, an unbiased futures based treatment program could be used to bolster alternative methods of treatment.

Got into it around 80.00 bought 40 coin. Lost them due to personal stupidity and key-logger virus. Learned a lot about two factor and password management. Expensive college course. I was hurt, but love Bitcoin. Water under bridge. Make sure to have two factor activated....lol

I think a purchase of a Keep Key is the best investment. Very secure.

Computer security. Make sure you have virus and spyware protection. Back up your wallet. Don't trust anyone. Do your research on the matter first. You will learn a hard lesson otherwise. You are responsible for any failures. It's the beauty of BitCoin that can sting.

I don't like hearing how BTC is responsible for all the evils in the world. Every crime that is blamed on BTC can also be blamed on the US dollar. BTC is freedom. BTC is also responsible for many good things, but we don't hear them discussed in the committee meetings.

I had the exact same thing happen to me with BTC-E...A very expensive lesson. I lost about 40 BTC (85.00 each at the time). 2FA is absolutely something all services should provide. Just because a confirming email was acknowledged does not infer 2FA....The token must be issued and entered. Makes things much more secure. Sorry about your loss, but it is a lesson well learned. I certainly learned mine. Merry Christmas.

The US is doing everything it can to make these exchanges more difficult to operate. Very sad.

Good for you.

I too was scammed. BTC-E Exchange stole my Litcoin right out of my wallet. One day it was there, the next day it was gone. I should have never left it on the exchange wallet. I learned a very expensive lesson in keeping the crypto currency close to my chest. I now have my own wallets stored on my PC and they are all encrypted. The hardest thing to accept is part of the crypto currency strength. There was nothing I could do and they knew it. It's a dog eat dog world out there. I love the freedom of the environment, but it is rife with those who know there is nothing that can be done to recover lost or stolen coin.

Wow. Deactivating my account with Dwolla was the easiest thing I have ever deactivated. They didn't even ask for a reason. I would say they just lost a lot of business and reason to exist. Dwolla is a form of virtual currency no one uses. The US government is obviously making it more and more difficult to purchase Bitcoin. It's going to get interesting.
