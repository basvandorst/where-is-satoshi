Commentors so far seem to miss the simple fact that Capitalism=! Money, but rather it is the broad arrangement of profit taking and labor for wages, and that is precisely the system which increased technology (like robotics) is rendering increasingly dysfunctional.
The question is how will we organize society when there are no longer nearly enough jobs to enable people to acquire the money they need to survive - using the blockchain and a reputation system to allocate the tools for basic living might just be a solution... definitely some interesting things to think about, thanks for posting!
