I'm not sure. There was a post a few days ago asking if their was one in development. I would suggest waiting for more reputable wallets like Circle or Coinbase to come out with a Windows app before downloading anything. 
Then again, users here may know of one that is legitimate? Search the subreddit and if you can't find anything, post a thread with this question.

The main difference between Coinbase and ChangeTip is that Coinbase (for now at least) is focused on integrating with content websites (like ZapChain, Wordpress, etc.) whereas ChangeTip is focused on social media tipping (websites like reddit, twitter, facebook, etc).
Whether or not it's easier depends on how you imagine yourself tipping the most. If you imagine yourself to be tipping more frequently on social media (arguably where it's happening the most), ChangeTip will be the easiest way to do so.
With Bitcoin, you can have any number of wallets. The bitcoin you have in your Coinbase wallet is still there and you can use it whenever you wish, but now you also have bitcoin stored with ChangeTip. To give you an analogy: think as if instead of having one bank account, you now have two. And, yes, you can transfer between those two accounts, i.e., transfer between Coinbase and ChangeTip wallets (or any wallet for that matter).

Thanks for supporting the ecosystem! :) 10,000 bits @_date: 2014-12-16 19:44:29
To give you quick rundown on how ChangeTip works on reddit (because the process is different for other social media):
1. Reply to a comment.
2. Mention a dollar amount, a bitcoin amount, or a pre-defined moniker (like 'coffee' or 'lunch' [without apostrophes]).
3. Mention 'without the apostrophes.
4. Hit send.
So it should look something like this:
'Hey, thanks for visiting Here's a coffee to get you started with !'

Large amounts of bitcoin (&gt;2 BTC) should be kept in "cold storage". Browse around the subreddit for more information about cold storage and best practices if you're new. Cold storage is high security, but since the whole point of cold storage is to make it difficult to move your bitcoin, these funds are harder to casually transact with.
Less than that is ideally kept in "hot wallets" like Circle.com or Coinbase for quick spending/buying/transacting access. Less security (relative to cold storage), but greater availability.
As far as how much bitcoin you need to be functional... that depends on how frequently you want to use it. No clear answer as this varies widely from person to person.
