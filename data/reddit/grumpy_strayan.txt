Nah baseball just isn't all that popular in Australia.

tell that to the guys that sell me my drugs

Outside of the real world scenarios you're going to have this issue.  People are fucking stupid and lazy.
There's a formal legal process for accessing a deceased estate, and you need to build that process yourself with your private keys.
Something as simple as the dead mans switch access in lastpass and storing your private keys in there would suffice.  Or your private keys in a safety deposit box etc.
  
Fact is - people are still going to need a bank to store this stuff because not everyone is financially or technologically adept.

Had to google who that was lol

Yeah valid.  Legitimately the only use I've had for bitcoin is buying steroids.

To be fair Amazon aren't exactly the poster child for low cost.

Does anyone here actually use it for anything legal except for the sake of novelty?
I would still use it, but only use it for non legal purposes anyway.  If it were illegal though, converting regular currency to btc would be more difficult.

I don't know where you are but with visa in Australia this is not a thing.
All interaction and resolution was with my bank over the phone..

Don't even bother, he's just going to tell you Cryptocurrencies are going to revolutionize the world and that anything else is garbage.

It's simply how it works, I'm not lucky.  We (or the bank) pay a premium to have visa cards and they come with mandatory insurance.
I'm all for the whole decentralizing from the banks, but be realistic.  It's not happening in the immediate future and what we have *does* indeed work.

Mine costs me nothing if I pay within 60 days, the vendor wears the costs. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:28:49
They have visa and mastercard insurance &amp; guarantees for this reason.  It's not perfect but it works..

I've had fraudulent transactions before. Tedious process but it was sorted out in about 10 business days

Yes - We speak weird

Just 500mg test-e a week, plus the estrogen control etc.  Very basic cycle.
has an insane amount of information if you ever feel like doing some reading. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:46:19
Lol, I'm currently on my first cycle and it was safer and much more private to buy online with btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:33:00
That's actually clever.  Need some roids, no worries I'll just get myself some bitcoin, fire up the ol tor browser and bam I'm swole.
