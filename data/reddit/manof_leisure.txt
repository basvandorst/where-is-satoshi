sorry, poorly worded. I attempted to short 10 BCH but ended up buying it rather than shorting it. It gave me the option of opening leverage with BCH/BTC. I don't know if the page hadn't refreshed properly as I had previously been on EUR/BTC which is possible to short or what...either way I was given the option of leverage on 10 BCH

I've stopped using it since their glitch lost me 40% of my BTC when I tried to short BCH the day it came out...

bought 10 BCH at 0.28 on kraken and set up the short sell with leverage. as the market was moving so fast it dropped really quickly and even though it came through as processed on my orders page once submitted, when I refreshed on the home page it wasn't there. Just came up as a bought trade. Ive shorted things a number of times on there so not sure what happened. I quickly found out that they hadn't allowed shorting on kraken so sold as quickly as I could but it was 15 minutes later and the market had massively dropped. obviously some glitch in the interface that let me go through the process without actually allowing it.
