TL/DR: likely just bulk spam with no threat.
I received this on a single-use email address used only for an account on bitcointalk.org in April 2013, and never used for anything else. bitcointalk's database was compromised at or before October 2013 (of course I changed my password), but no phishing spam seen until 2016.
Most spam had the word hack or hacking in the sender name, for example WU-Hack, and offering discounted iPhones and invites to "underground" bitcoin investments. ICO spam started in August 2017. Only one spam included an obvious trojan/exploit-attempt attachment. In November one email offered to sell the Bitcointalk email database for 1 BTC with a free validation sample of all addresses starting with three letters of my choosing. Plus various phishing attempts for blockchain dot info (fake "your Blockchain account has been locked").
This adds to the likelihood that it's just a bulk spam mailing with zero credibility to "We know that you keep your coins on these exchanges".
My message asked for 0.01 BTC and was relayed via a japanese server. I second other posters in that noone should reply or take any action (other than re-checking your general security and safe practices).

Context: [New York Hearing on (Bitcoin) Virtual Currencies, Panel 1 Day 2]( at 37 minutes 12 seconds.
 
New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky  asked whether there is "really anonymity" with currencies that use public ledgers (he also mentioned pseudonymity).
At 38 minutes 18 seconds Cyrus R. Vance, Jr- District Attorney of New York replies tangentially that knowing an IP address does not equal knowing the person's identity.
At 38 minutes 52 seconds Richard B. Zabel- Deputy U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of NY replied along the lines that there were substantial challenges in the Silk Road investigation, and then mentions tumbler services and that "in the cases I've seen", "there may be out there legimitate uses for those I'm not aware of", and "they serve no other purposes other than to be money laundering and identity concealers".

I check bitaddress.org whenever I create a printed wallet offline, but not blockchain.info code.
blockchain.info, or its attacker, could indeed deliver different code as you state.
bitaddress.org is a lot easier to check as it's just one file, so I check it against the copy at  and also check its SHA when I copy it to a USB prior to offline rebooting from LiveCD/LiveUSB.
For blockchain.info I assume others are checking with better tools than mine - there are more files to check, and I see the login html has an extra "seed" that changes each time I save it (using Web developer tools in Firefox):

But isn't it simpler to boot from a Live-USB Linux distro while completely disconnected? No need to make Virtual Ram, which could be monitored by the host OS if I understood that thread and its links correctly.
As long as I  can trust the BIOS has not been compromised, and that there are no hardware spy devices inside the machine, I'd rather reduce the number of variables to worry about. Could I be 100% confident the host of the Virtual RAM OS is not logging keyboard and/or the display? Later, after the OS is "wiped" and the (assumedly compromised) host machne connects to the net, it tells its "handler".

Could you describe how it would be possible for blockchain.info to collect several keys without detection? As far as I understand their system, the login password stays on your own browser and cannot be used by their server:
also: 
I can see a risk if the javascript files delivered by blockchain.info were not being regularly checked, but I believe people do check (I myself hand check the bitaddress.org javascript checksums match each time I use it, and I know others spot any changes quickly).
Outside of the user's computer being already keylogged, or maybe their router compromised, I cannot see a way for an attack to work for more than a tiny fraction of password thefts before detection.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:07:28
No, I just check bitaddress.org's checksum, and the recent github changelog. I do read the javascript but do not do any analysis or debugging on it, so I cannot verify it produces cryptographically strong private keys.
The question is valid and has been raised before: 
If I had a large number of BTC, I might consider splitting to several wallets from various generators, such the open source Electrum. I could (but don't) create my own private key from coins, cards, or dice, and then use bitaddress.org offline to derive the public key (see [1]( and then print that.

You can verify the blockchain ledger shows there is bitcoin at the public address using a block chain explorer,
for example 
shows the BTC at public address 12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX
Make sure you use your PUBLIC address when doing this!
To truly verify, in a secure risk free way, that the private key is usable in a future spend transaction also interests me,
but I can only guess without having tried.
[Craig Wright appears to have claimed to do this]( but others remain skeptical it meant anything other than a piece of theatre.
I guess one would use an offline test net that holds the complete blockchain and make a test transaction (still offline) and confirm that the test miner (on the same offline machine) validates the transaction into the next block mined.
(Remember to destroy the machine after this test)
This would be the safest way I think, if impractical.

This [bitcoinfees]( page tells me the bitcoin fees are somewhat complicated to determine, and I'm unsure it is up to date as it might be confusing 0.0001 with 0.0005 bit coin fees. A few hours ago I made two small test transfers from blockchain.info of approximately 0.0015 BTC and each time the site assessed a fee of 0.0005, which is about 10 US cents now.
If I was a customer I would expect the payment mechanism to tell me the total cost of any purchase, fees included, because that it is what I experience with PayPal or credit card purchases (some airlines excepted). For some reason blockchain.info did not warn me what the total deduction would be. 10 cents might be no problem for a 10 dollar item, but the lack of transparency might cause a loss of trust.

Bitcoin has possible transaction fees, a minimum transaction amount, a limit to transaction complexity, and a time delay. Otherwise it is frictionless with respect to geographical location (something I consider to be a very important feature) and user identity. Converting to or from another currency brings in another set of "frictions".

You will just have to wait, and remember to include a fee next time.
The last person I saw in this situation tried to double spend it with a highish fee, but the original tx eventually confirmed after 2.5 days, leaving the double-spend to expire.
Your tx should have been visible in the network though, check  (which is very long now and may lag your browser) and search for your input or output address. If it's not there, then it's not in the network.

Difficulty in September changed from about 60, through 80, 110 and ending at 140 million. The trend was clear back then in August, see  2 GH/s with diff 60 million generated about 100 USD monthly, so that might have persuaded some.
So, those buyers must assumed difficulty would suddenly plateau, or merely increase linearly rather than geometrically (or they just failed basic arithmetic).

Article is a PR piece for a forex news website which features some brokers on its front page.
The featured brokers do not make it clear in which countries you need to be resident before they will accept applications. I tested two, iOption appears to be Cyprus based - [here is a review]( They have no Demo account so unable to test. Their live person chat uses a domain that I block for security reasons.
The second I tested was AvaTrade, who are based in Ireland and do provide demo accounts: they insist on real names and telephone numbers.
Their terms and conditions do not contain any restrictions on residency and they state they follow the "European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations". However, they DO NOT accept United States citizens.
Their demo account does indeed include bitcoin instant trades with a reasonable spread, see 
AvaTrade's FAQ is here:  - the usual for a stockbroking/forex account but do not allow change of base currency, you must open an account for each base.
I did not test any of the other forex brokers, here's a list of demo accounts if anyone is interested:

This is called arbitrage, and would work, but depends on you extracting the bitcoin from the German exchange and depositing it in the US exchange, before the price changes adversely.
I have done this with stocks, but you need good timing and fast transfers. From what I've seen the bitcoin exchanges do not provide fast transfers in any direction.
Some speculators are no doubt already doing this, but they are taking various risks (for example: adverse price movement, third party interference, and counterparty risk).

I do not understand the fee percentages paragraph at all. For example, with BTC at USD 800 the initial fee for a 1 BTC transaction is 30 %, meaning a user would pay USD 1040 for 1 BTC, with USD 240 (0.3 BTC) going to the buying company? Or to the ATM seller? And the 50% must be a typo for 5.0 %, otherwise I cannot see anyone using the ATM. I've been paying 10% to 15% using loocalbitcoins just for the convenience of not having to go through an exchange for example, and face to face forex currency exchanges charge typically 7% in the UK, and less than 0.5 % in Switzerland, last time I was there.

Your first zero-fee transaction eventually became [confirmed two hours ago]( and it took about two and a half days, quite a long time. 
I guess the attempted double-spend will expire after 24 hours, and it probably failed to confirm because the original tx had higher priority due to its age. A good reason to avoid zero fee or low fee txs (I had to wait 3+ hours once when someone sent me a zero fee tx).

I guess the AML specifically does not allow the bank to tell the customer the reason. That's the case with UK law at least. I recall reading the regulations money transfer companies must adhere to and they include high penalties and risk of losing the license if they breach them. They cannot leak out how they flag accounts to avoid informing criminals how to evade. The risk of losing a bank partner or license is uppermost in the minds of companies such as coinbase.

Skip to "Explanation" in this rather technical level explanation: 
Less accurately, think of each address as holding the unspent results of the previous transaction, and the output addresses (or a single address if it's a zero fee straight move) will hold the results of the transaction once it's confirmed into the ledger (the blockchain). In your case, your wallet must have had one address with 3.2589 BTC, but the protocol requires the whole input to be used, so it's "split" into two (or three if a fee is needed): 3.0 BTC to send to HashTheirAddress, plus 0.2539 BTC as change to HashMyAddress. For security reasons some (most) users would choose a completely new address for the change, say HashMyChangeAddress. If you look through the blockchain you'll see a few variations of this kind of transaction.

The immediate reason is recently mined blocks are not holding enough transactions to make much difference to the pool of unconfirmed transactions.
Why that is I have no idea, it's a puzzle to me too. As if the mining pools' software cannot keep up?
Your fee is the minimum, but that just places the transaction at low priority, and there are so many other transactions competing with slightly higher fees, some use 0.0005, and I've seen some even higher.
Look at the latest block: 
and scan the list and notice they all either have an inputs greater than 1.0 BTC (gives priority), or they took a long time to confirm (one took over 2900 minutes), or the occasional minimum fee tx got lucky with a quick confirm.

After looking at the possibilities (not good from the UK), I would get your UK bank to send your father US dollars. Make sure the bank converts to dollars first otherwise the US bank will likely make big charges for converting itself.
Check the fees and the exchange rate they use first, some banks can be right rip-offs, but it's tough to find anything cheaper than GBP 25 for the wire and GBP 55 for the exchange rate margin. These are still lower than any alternative I can think of.
If your bank is one that charges over 3 % margin (they won't tell you this of course, you have to get them to quote a precise exchange rate and figure it out) then use moneycorp ([see here]( to wire the fund as they charge "only" 2% margin.
This advice changes if you have a large account at some private bank, such as citibank, when you may find attractive rates using their debit or credit card (Nationwide used to offer an unprecedented low exchange rate, under 0.2 % I recall).

If by "show up on the blockchain" you mean "be seen by the bitcoin nodes", the transaction should be visible in the network within seconds, in my (limited) experience.
If your bitcoin client is poorly connected to the network I guess it could take longer. If you meant "until a miner includes it in an accepted block" a zero fee transaction could take hours, days, never. Even those with 0.0001 fee can take a few hours.

Also, in these situations, you should always stop using the same computer where you lost or deleted the file so that you can start data recovery without overwriting parts of the disk that may contain remnants of the lost data. That means removing the hard disk and either taking it to an expert recoverer, or learning how to do it yourself (example: mount as read only on a linux machine, image it to a backup drive, then run recovery software). Did you have any Windows versioning enabled that might let you recover the older notepad file version?

After looking at what transactions get included in each newly mined block, I have come to the same conclusion. A few low tx's get in fast  though, eg:  - as if the first dozen low fee txs get while in the rest get pushed to the back by the higher fee txs.

As I'm in a similar position to the OP being quite new to buying bitcoins with GBP, I checked the following services mentioned in this thread:
*  - GBP 139 per bitcoin, no sign up needed, payment only from UK bank accounts setup with Faster Payments System (should be all UK current accounts), email optional (to receive notifications and communicate in case of delays, get higher purchase limits). I have made 3 transactions so far, one was delayed over 3 hours in the bitcoin network's unconfirmed transactions queue (admin kept me informed and responded to my queries), other two got confirmed within 20 minutes. System shows profiles and email addresses of sellers. Buyer can choose to buy without registering or logging in at all (from 0.1 per day depending on whether IP is in UK or not) or registering an email (around 0.4 BTC, varies), or providing progressively more identification (no idea what as I haven't gone this far).
*  - GBP 148.10 per bitcoin lowest price for under 1 BTC purchases, requires sign in to purchase, looks similar system to bittylicious from description.
I tried to register for this but refused to go further when after I had given my full name and address, they required my photo id and bank statement and a picture of me holding up id and statement. Such practice of not disclosing *all* the requirements up front really annoys me (they are not the only company that does this). Incredibly expensive and complex.
*  - I have a wallet with blockchain, but did not try to buy using them until now. When I tried, they redirect to  which requires just email, username, password to get to the trade window. Need to verify to start trading but only in EUR or USD, not GBP. To trade 5000 USD per month need to provide Full name, Date of birth, Country of residence, and Phone number. Last trade was EUR 151.45 per bitcoin, which is GBP 129.75, better than bittylicious. Fee was 0.2 %. Possibly useful for traders but over complicated (FOREX costs GBP to EUR, uncertain delays, requires too much personal information) for a simple consumer like myself. 
*  Well, I emailed them for an invitation and am still waiting for a response. You cannot register without an invitation, so unable to investigate further. They claim fees are 3.50% but no way to see price per bitcoin. (EDIT typo)

I don't know enough to give a definitive answer to this case, but the time it takes a transaction to be confirmed by being included in the block a miner just released depends on its priority. Its priority depends partly on the fee, partly on the types on inputs, and (rarely) partly on the type of input and output scripts (see right hand side of tx page). Also, miners are free to decide which transactions to include - there's an incentive for them to include the fee paying ones first. Some miners may use clients that are more tolerant and accept more free transactions or even the so-called "strange" transactions. Furthermore, the chance a transaction gets included will depend (in a complex way) on how many unconfirmed transactions are pending in the network - see  which shows an unusually large number at the moment, all waiting (and competing) to be confirmed next. So, who knows, maybe at 23:11 there were few unconfirmed txs around (Chinese asleep?) while at 13:50:32 everyone and their cat is busy sending bitcoins. (EDIT to fix typos)

(warning: rant) It's the infrastructure that interfaces with real life activities that needs development, not really the protocol itself.
Most of my problems are the same as the problems involved with online transactions involving money: there's a lot of really awful banking interface problems to list here, but I see similar problems with the bitcoin-entity interfaces.
I'm sure these have been discussed ad nauseam elsewhere, but my short list for just purchases with fiat: awful payment screens, payment methods that return misleading error codes (moneybookers especially), major banks that have broken TFA, banks that provide broken PIN card devices, insecure online websites by major banks (!), terrible human-computer interaction design (major banks again, even in 2013), I better stop here before I over-rant. Now, I've looked at a few bitcoin merchants and exchanges, and frankly I see similar problems - it's like they're trying to copy the bad designs of banks and credit cards!
In short, I believe we have to endure this phase of awful companies until natural selection wins out. How to make it better? Truly global mobile device that provides TFA plus extra security options, must work with any mobile provider (yes I know, impossible), in almost any nation. One example of TFA failing in practice: one country's bank sends SMS code that another country's mobile telephone network fails/refuses to accept, and nothing the user can do about it. Somehow prevent bitcoin from depending on such broken infrastructure.
Rant over.

Probably too late, but as soon as you find you've deleted something valuable on a computer not recoverable from any recycle bin, one approach is to shut the machine down, remove the hard disk, clone it and make backups, then run recovery software on one of the copies. If it's very valuable take it to a recovery expert. If it's Windows, check whether some kind of automatic file backup or versioning was enabled - some Pro versions had this, might have been [Shadow Copy]( I remember pointing someone to where their deleted game files were a few years ago.

EDIT 1: to add links for Natwest: [costs for sending money abroad]( and [rip-off two percent exchange rate]( - looks like you would need to use a currency broker to find a rate lower than 1 %.
Doesn't bitstamp require Euros as funding which it converts to dollars and then to bitcoins?
This will not avoid the UK bank fees, so one may as well use the bank to convert and wire dollars direct to OP's father's US account.
Otherwise, one used to be able to convert sterling to USD or Euros with transferwise for only about 0.5 % but they stopped that in April, so the OP would need to use the UK bank to first convert GBP to EUR and then wire to bitstamp. That might cost GBP 10 plus 1 % (Natwest example). Costs so far: GBP 35.
Then there will be these additional [fees](
bitstamp converts EUR to USD with this [exchange rate]( which is now "1,3653 	1,3543" (commas mean decimal points in Europe), that's about 0.4 % margin from the midrate. For GBP 2500 (in Euros now) that would be GBP 10, not too bad.
It then charges 0.42 % to buy the bitcoins, that's another GBP 10.40 or so. 
I could not determine what bitstamp charges for withdrawing bitcoins but it does require verification. Let's assume it's free.
Total charges : GBP 55 for a transfer of GBP 2500.
This does not include the charges by coinbase for converting Bitcoin to USD.
Costs of wiring from GBP to USD would have to exceed that enhanced total to make using bitcoin worthwhile.
I'd be interested if there were cheaper ways than this, because it is a general problem for expats.

[Pay any utility bill using bitcoin](
With these caveats: I have not tried this, they charge 5 %, and I know it will not work in some Eurozone countries because some (all?) utility companies will not accept IBAN transfers. Last time I checked my utility bills several years ago, the only options were cash over their counter, at the post office, at certain bill paying kisoks, or via direct debit from a local bank (explicitly disallowing foreign banks, credit cards, and IBAN transfers). 
I just re-checked some of my bills and there's still no way to pay via IBAN. This is not a criticism of Bitcoin but of the extreme slowness of some EU states to modernise. EDIT: fix link

Everyone who is telling you it is not possible, is correct.
However, some time ago a sender unintentionally set a very high miner's fee (many BTC) in a valid transaction. They asked here or on bitcointalk for help and they were lucky in that Eleuthria, the owner of mining pool BTC Guild that mined in that transaction, agreed to return that part of the fee that had not already been dispensed to the pool's miners. Eleuthria did not have to do this, but realized it was a user or client error. It wasn't a chargeback, of course, as the main transaction was confirmed. Otherwise the protocol requires that whoever holds the signing key (the private key) for an address can spend the coins in that address. Breaking that would simply break the bitcoin concept, and everyone knows this.

How do know what fraction of those transactions involved buying a product or service? Most of them could have been buys and sells on exchanges, and transfers between addresses.

I wrote: "bitstamp converts EUR to USD"


How? Many in the UK would like to find a way to do this as cheaply as Europeans or Americans can buy BTC with their currencies. localbitcoins and bittylicious are invariably 12 to 20 % over even the highest BTC rate.
Sending GBP to MTGox suffers the same bank charges as sending to bitstamp (must convert to EUR or USD first). GBP currency conversions attract really high margin costs of over 2 % for small amounts such as GBP 2500. This drops below 1 % around GBP 100 thousand. This is the major cost, plus the GBP 25 for international payments.
MtGox does not appear to accept GBP, so same problem as bitstamp.

As of now Virtex shows CAD 216.81.
I may be able to explain why an ATM is far more interesting than Virtex to a newcomer like myself who only wants to buy amounts less than 100 USD (or EUR or GBP).
My [comment here]( summarises my experiences of trying to buy in the UK.
I also looked at localbitcoins and would probably try them if they weren't more complicated, and not really cheaper, than my first find.
I looked a exchanges but their fees and procedures completely put me off. Using Virtex as an example, see [their fees here]( Look a those fees and those delays. That's not at all what I'm looking for. Virtex is clearly for traders not consumers.
I want convenience and not to waste my time. I want something simpler than buying a top up
prepaid credit card - in my G8 country I have to provide passport, residence proof, and a filled in paper form in person (not online) at a counter. I don't mind too much if it's a state bank or state post office, but there's no way I'd hand over that identification over the internet or even in person to a stranger.
In short, the claims that it's cheaper to use this or that exchange may well be true for large trades, but certainly not for small amounts.
