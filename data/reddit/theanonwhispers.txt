See here’s the problem it’s not the same as penny stocks. If you’re are I would like to see a portfolio. I’m not being argumentative at all but I passed your comment. I know if you were busy in penny stock you wouldn’t be looking at bitcoins. I’m calling a bluff with the knowledge of simple economics mixed with the Wolf of Wall Street. 
This is bitcoin welcome to a whole new world

Lol and I’m scared of the stock market, honestly I didn’t goto school for my series 7 but I understand charts, computers , banned from aol when I was 10. In my case that I day trade because I have to I have bills and direct family who always helped out I probably wouldn’t even be talking to you about this if I never got hurt with this brain injury. I understand electrical and live feed, but I still have to say it’s still the Wild West especially with all of the markets. Satoshi may have made bitcoin and one day that wallet will be stolen or cracked. (I don’t care what anyone has to say on this one this will happen) There is going to be a group that will �� % take those lost coins, lost wallets, shit I even went back to my wallets and was stunned how much I picked up and reinvested with my pennies that grown to dollars.  
And to tell you the truth. I don’t listen to anyone who speaks.Small forums is where you find some great posts. I learned what I learned but I am thankful that I have a roof over my head and can help out my mother with her bills so she has a nice.  So I try to return as much as I can do 
Thank you for your input but I still have my opinion but that’s the beauty of Reddit were most of the time you get a bunch of jerks that jump all over your one post. Shoot me pm.  Lol my office is the corner of my tempura lmao. Where the state has left me to die. Lol after 3 years of having seizures, I’m finally coming back to normal with a lot still holding my voice. Especially just a post like this. It didn’t take me 45 mins to respond but to look over all of my spelling and look for missing words.

This is so true you can not predict something especially something that was made by an the mystery of satoshi. Not one person in the world could tell you exactly what’s going to happen. No one knows what’s really running the btc chain. 
All I know is it made such a huge impact in the financial district that it took teams of professionals. Now we are talking about people with fantastic minds. So with that and how our tech is going BTC is a staple. If it wasn’t GOOGLE AND APPLE would not allow apps like this. Well google bc it’s android and they have better things to do like working with our government. 
People are having panic attack’s and can’t look a person in the eye this is all from technology. I love bitcoin but this isn’t the last time you will see it especially since we are now being tossed out processing power and 5G about to be launched. Nothing is perfect but my advice is to analyze the charts and not just from one. Look at a couple. Make sure your ready to for the commitment and honesty if you do it right. This is the new wave, and I even want to launch a blockchain but first I’m going back to school abroad since it’s been more adopted and study computer science and I will still be doing what I do everyday ever since 2015 I’ve been on workman’s comp and suffering from a TBI, but bitcoins have kept the lights on and food on the table. Not the check that comes every two weeks. 
Crypto makes you crazy and it’s a perfect storm it’s digital and was launched at the perfect time When smartphones started popping up. 
I could only imagine the stress behind some of the post on this sub. 
I just hope that everyone does well and thanks for letting me post, sending good vibes all day 
Bye
