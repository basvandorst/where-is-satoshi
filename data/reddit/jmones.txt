If you use an American exchange they could subpoena their records. If you're using a foreign exchange it would be more difficult

Guy's a douche. Totally. But this ain't fishing. The last part is inconsequential without the first part. It is a dependent clause. Learn how to read.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:48:45
Learn from my mistake. Unless you are absolutely certain that they are savvy enough to control their own wallet do not give them full control. A few Christmas' back I gave some as presents in .25 increments. Most have been lost
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:35:10
I agree. I guess you need to ask yourself if you're willing to take the risk. I'm not. I'm sure there are a ton of people who feel the same way. It will definitely reduce volume on crypto/crypto trading pairs on US exchanges.

It's true. People who know nothing about and have no stake in bitcoin seem to get so angry about it. I was at a Xmas eve party in my sister's neighborhood and the conversation turned to btc. They were all bashing it. My sister was going to pipe in about my experience but I stopped her. Nobody got time for that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:13
I doubt this guy is legit
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:11:53
The IRS is doing away with all like kind exchanges except for real estate in the new tax bill. They tax bitcoin like it is property. Similar to a collectible or artwork. You can make crypto/crypto trades tax free up until tomorrow. 2018 it will be a taxable event.

7/10 $1k worth at .08 is 12500 btc. "Funny to think that in 2016 I was flat broke and had nothing to my name." The low price in that year was about 370. 12500x370=4,625,000

I am a lifelong newspaper man with 17 years of printing experience and its gotta be white. The white lettering inside the bold blue headline is gonna come off looking messy.
Edit* In order to make the white letters look good on a bold background you have to line up 4 different printing couples to the millimeter. There is much more room for error and as a result a much more uniform quality with the white version. Consult the print shop they will tell you the same thing.

I had a buddy who came out of the blue and started asking me about it a couple of weeks before the fork. He said he had 10k to invest. It was around 2k at the time I told him do it now. Not only do i think its going higher but youll get some free bch too. Instead of pulling the trigger he talked to his stock broker who talked him out of it. I try to not rub it in.
