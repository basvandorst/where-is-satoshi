I am a retired IT university teacher. I know very little about the software behind specific digital currencies but it seems the essential feature of a digital currency is that it uses a p2p network with a blockchain record system (a sort of digital ledger) to record individual transactions. Every node in the network has a copy of the blockchain which enables them to carry out transactions without needing a third party such as a bank and/or a government to guarantee integrity. The integrity control of the system is built into the network software. There is no way that the Danish police could ever trace the identity of bitcoin users from the bitcoin ledger (blockchain) but every bitcoin user has to become a member of the network at some point in time. They do so by browsing to an existing website such as bitcoin.org. and downloading the software to their computers. Presumably that is the point of vulnerability where the police might be able to hack into the system in order to identify users?

I bought bitcoin around dec 2013 at a price of around US$ 900. I held it for around a year and watched its price dive to around US$ 450 before I finally decided to sell.....

"inherently valuable"?? What on earth does that mean... the value of something is what you can get for it, simple as that!
