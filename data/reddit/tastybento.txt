What exactly does Blockstream mean though when they say they want to "sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee and taking transaction fees"? Why wouldn't these enterprises simply run the side chains themselves?

Seems to work for you. Weird. I made the exact same post on another account without changing the word moderation, and it was invisible to anybody but me.

I agree to almost everything that you say. The only point I was trying to make is that SegWits *reputation* partially suffered because of this sub.    
I'm not trying to say that SegWit is bad, neither am I trying to say that being banned from a forum is a good reason to be against something.
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:39:03
To be honest though, the mmm0dderati0n on r/bitcoin is one of the problems that SegWit has. I'm a casual guy that doesn't even understand this whole SegWit vs. BU debate, but simply the fact that the 0vermmm0dderati0n of this sub tries to shove SegWit down everyone's throats, and that the other sub where everyone may speak freely tends to be pro BU, makes me as a casual bitcoin user side with the pro BU guys, simply because they appear to be more trustworthy. Sorry.
**EDIT:** lol, I had to type mmm0dderati0n like this in order for my post to even *APPEAR* on this sub. That's outright ridiculous.

It's disheartening to see how that discussion is way more constructive and open-minded than anything I've read here in the last months. I really wish the people on this sub would finally get their shit together.

Cool story bro. Pretty useless advice though. If there's a HF, people will have their old coins in *both* chains, so "worthless bitcoins" to worry about do not even exist yet.    
And if BU really wins and Core dies, bitmynt.no will simply die as well if they reject changes that much, and BU won't give a fuck. I think his way of putting it is pretty narrow-minded and not really helpful to the average "new norwegian user".
Pure panicmongering. There are far better ways to convince people to use core.

Of course there are always going to be *some* trolls in threads as big as these. It's close to 500 comments now and there's no way I'm gonna read all of them, I've still read a big chunk of it though (most upvoted ones first), and it's full of really great, factual comments creating a constructive and lively discussion, that Meni even thanked them for in the OP.
I don't think that would be possible the other way round. No matter how reasonable and open for discussion BU supporters present themselves over here, they're usually instantly drowned in hostility and blind toxicity. It's become almost impossible to have a factual discussion about block size.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:45:43
Yes, but BTC's profitability also won't go *down* the same as BCH's on the same timeframe. BCH's hashrate is increasing dramatically right now, it's almost at 60% of BTC's hashrate. I expect it's profitability to go down heavily very soon.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:06:10
I agree but your logic in the last paragraph is a bit off.
You assume that mining BCH will permanently be more profitable than mining BTC, but that's not how difficulty adjustments work. Sooner or later your idea *will* work both ways, depending on which chain is more profitable at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:21:54
As a new user, you shouldn't choose your side immediately just because you "read a post". Wait and observe, try to get a good understanding of the whole picture surrounding Bitcoin, and then form your opinion afterwards.
Biggest problem of or modern society is people having strong opinions without being sufficiently informed. Just hold on to your Bitcoins for now and you'll be fine.

@_date: 2017-11-05 02:17:12
Wait a second. Doesn't the fork just create two chains that go their seperate ways but share exactly the same history up to the point of time where the fork happens? That means if you stored BTC on a paper wallet in the past, these BTC will automatically exist on both chains, and are available using the exact same private key. No need to use coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:40:09
Why do we need to seperate them? Is that because of the missing replay protection thing?

I thought Ver took up Loaded's challenge, but then Loaded didn't respond anymore?    
Or is there any official statement from Loaded where he claims that Ver ran away from the challenge?

I gotta say that your comment was really helpful to me, because it's unbiased neutral and looks at the situation from a broader point of view, even though some of my questions were a little provocative.    
Thank you for that, I feel like I've got a little deeper understanding of what's going on now, seriously.

And why do other miners not have a strong incentive to use Asicboost and block SegWit as well? Wouldn't this lead to the very same results?
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:02:41
I tend to ask bazillions of questions, sometimes even mean or provocative ones, mainly because I don't feel like I understand Bitcoin and everything that's going on around it well enough yet, and it's often hard to distinguish truth from propaganda in either of the subreddits.
That's why I really appreciate people like you taking the time to give long answers to my posts and explain everything in detail.    
Thank you, seriously!
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:42:42
I don't get it. You say that evil miners are blocking SegWit to make more money. Then you say that honest miners are supporting SegWit to make more money.
Is miners trying to make more money a good or a bad thing then? Is it only a good thing if they support SegWit? Why are miners not indifferent towards SegWit if they'll make more money either way?
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:42:52
Can anyone ELI5?    
He says BU is bad because raising the block size limit opens the door for a lot more problems, since the consensus rules like block size limit are what make bitcoin bitcoin and you shouldn't change them just because it's inconvenient.    
A few minutes later he says that LN will need a bigger block size eventually. How does that add up?
He also states that miners should support SegWit because LN will increase fees. That's cool for miners, but how is it good for users?
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:43:37


What you're saying makes far more sense than what Mow says in the interview. I fully agree with your point, but Mow said what he said and it seems to me that he didn't think things through and his anti BU arguments are really bad.


That's still not good for users that do not run nodes, is it? And imagine a fair scenario where *everyone* would be running a node to make a little money on transaction fees - wouldn't this encourage not using bitcoin transactions? You gain money from fees for running your node, you lose money from fees for making transactions. So the ones that profit the most are the ones who make the least transactions. So it'd probably be best if you just make one single transaction per month to exchange all your BTC for fiat money and use that instead. Then again, if everyone would do that, you couldn't earn much from transactions anyway and people might stop running nodes again. Am I overthinking this and jumping to conclusions too fast?
How will LN help general Bitcoin adaption if it increases fees for transactions?

Hope you didn't misunderstand me! Your poll is perfectly fine, I'm interested in the results as well!
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:25:30
Did you buy Bitcoin because you wanted to own Bitcoin or just because you want to exchange them back to Dollars for profit?
Is it really surprising news that an investment you make could fall in value?
If you're here for the Bitcoins - don't worry, if you own 3 BTC before the fork, you'll still own 3 BTC after the fork.
If you're here for Dollar profits - well, value can rise or it can fall, doesn't even matter if there's a fork or not. You should've known that beforehand.

I don't really get it, what exactly did BIP148 do?
Some years ago miners agreed to have SegWit coupled with a 2MB HF. Now we give them SegWit and a 2MB HF and miners are happy. How is this such a huge success, why did we even need BIP148? Couldn't we have done literally the exact same thing two years ago if we had just agreed to the 2MB HF back then?

I'll just accept that as the most elaborate form of agreement that you're willing to give me, so I'm fine with that!


C'mon dude. You seem to understand at least the basics of how economics work, so what's making it so hard for you to distinguish people who don't have a clue about economics from people who do? Constantly asking people about the books they've read only makes you appear very very insecure.
If someone doesn't know anything about economics and keeps talking nonsense, it is easy for someone who knows his stuff to prove him wrong with simple facts anyway.
Btw, the books someone has read don't mean anything, because simply reading them is by far not enough to make you an expert on anything. When you start critically questioning what you've read instead of blindly believing it, when you start drawing *your own* conclusions instead of copying someone else's, that's the point where you probably *really* know your stuff. There are so many books about economics out there that are build on false presumptions, contain crucial errors in reasoning or oversimplify things. So what's the point in asking people how many or which books they've read?
If my teenage daughter makes any statement related to economics, is it automatically wrong just because she never read a book about it? No! If what she says is correct, it's correct! If not, I'll explain why! I wouldn't even think about discrediting what she said just because she's never read a book about it!
Feel free to keep asking me if I've read any books on the subject, since I still haven't answered that question yet. Cheers!

The short answer to your question: We are fixing rising fees (a very indirect sign of value) to increase **demand** (the *true* sign of value).
Long version:      The point I was trying to make is, if you think things through, the statements *"rising fees are a sign of value"* and *"low fees are good for bitcoin"* do *not* contradict each other *per se*!
BTC has a limited supply and it's value is tied to *demand* and only *demand*. Rising fees are actually only a sign of rising demand for transactions, and rising demand is the *true* sign of value. So while rising fees sort of indicate value, they do so very indirectly.
Imagine that the blockchain could magically handle 10x as many transactions from tomorrow without any trade-offs. Fees would shrink immediately! Is that a sign of BTC losing value? No it's not! BTC would be more efficient and better than ever before, demand would rise a lot, BTC prices would skyrocket. BTC would suddenly be much more valuable despite shrinking fees. Of course we'd sooner or later reach some sort of equilibrium again: if demand kept rising and rising over the next months/years, fees would climb back to where they were before.
Or imagine the extreme case: a BTC without any fees that could process all transactions within a reasonable timeframe (however this may be achieved). The missing fees would surely not indicate that BTC is now worthless, the complete opposite would be the case. BTC would gain value beyond imagination.
Let's stay realistic though: If we want BTC to be a success and become more valuable, it needs to grow to play a much bigger role in our everyday lifes, and become a real alternative to fiat, banks and visa. We'll have to wait and see what amount of fees will be appropriate at that point, but until then, the lower we keep the fees, the faster the worldwide BTC adaption will be.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:31:30
But don't fees only rise if there are a lot of transactions not being confirmed? How is it a sign of value that transactions can't be confirmed?
Please don't be too harsh on me, I'm just trying to understand.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:17:54
nobody outside of reddit really cares for BIP148 or thinks of it as a good idea.
it'll be like jizzing on a hotplate, you'll hear a faint fizzle and then it's gone.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:51:40


ahahahaha lol


Alright okay, I agree with this point!
Here's the problem though: imagine fees skyrocketing to about a hundred dollars tomorrow. Of course that'd be a sign of value, because people are obviously willing to pay huge fees to use bitcoin. Awesome! On the other hand though, for fees to rise that high there'd have to be hundred thousands or even millions of unconfirmed transactions, which massively cripples Bitcoins usability.
tl;dr: rising fees *are of course* a sign of value, but that doesn't mean that low fees are a sign of low value! Bitcoin will definitely be healthier, more useful and more succesful if we try to keep fees low.
