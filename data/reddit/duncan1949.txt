Price presently between 220 and 500 USD.  Buy anywhere within these limits because bitcoin will be an order of magnitude higher with in two years; two orders of magnitude higher within 5 years;  and three orders within 10 years.

* As I see it, increasing the blocksize will increase capacity, decrease transaction time, but render BTC less resistant to attack.
* I think security is paramount and therefore leave the blocksize as it is - it is proven - the security works - don't fiddle with it.
* to address the size / speed issue we could use something like Litecoin (which was developed by Lee specifically for this purpose).  Bitcoin should not be used frequently and only be used for large transactions - e.g. buying a car; or storage of wealth.  When money is needed it can be decanted to, for e.g. litecoin.

What a fantastic idea.  Love the little twist of bypassing the USA until they come to their senses about regulation - it's not the American people that are at fault - it's their Nazi neo-con government that has hijacked the legislature and the nation. There will soon be a rude awakening.
In the meantime, how can one invest in this company?

Both Standardcrypto and btchip give apt answers - following them will solve your issue.  In the meantime, if you can see the transaction on the blockchain (at the address your HW gave you) you are fine - the bitcoins will go nowhere until you sort your Ledger issue out.  So, don't worry - relax.

Get your bitcoin off Coinbase - get it off any exchange - and store it in a Trezor and / or a brain wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:25:20
The lesson here is not to keep ones bitcoin in an exchange - they are not under your control.  The only places to store bitcoin is in paper wallets, brain wallets, and a Trezor (or similar off-line hardware wallet).

The kernel of the problem with "UPI" is that it entrusts "the government" with the ledger - and 6,000 years of history gives not one instance where "the government" can be trusted.  Need one say more?  Bitcoin is immutable - i.e. cannot be changed and therefore the gold-standard of trustworthiness.  Nothing can be more trustworthy.

Hi - is the bitcoin community ready for dollar collapse?  To elaborate: when the dollar collapses / disappears / hyperinflates there will be a rush for gold, silver and bitcoin.  However, the vast majority of people do not understand bitcoin or how to buy and transact with it.  Are there systems and apps in place that will be able to deal with this situation - where, all of a sudden, there will be many millions of people (ignorant of the basics of bitcoin use) wanting to buy and transact with it?

Indeed - it is the bankers - they are putting up as many barriers as possible to discourage use.  Yet further evidence of how scared they are that bitcoin will "eat their lunch".  And it will.

Really don't know what all the fuss is about.  It is clear, bitcoin's primary function is security.  For this - PRIMARY - function it is fine - and has withstood this attack (from within).  The distributed network must be preserved for its primary function of security.  For speed one converts some of ones bitcoin into LiteCoin and transacts with those - much like one withdraws cash from an ATM every now-and-then.  There are a number of lessons to be learnt from this: 1) Trust no single person or organisation - EVER; 2) with our lives we must protect the distributed nature of bitcoin; 3) The powers that be (banksters / government) will do anything to topple bitcoin; 4) Trust no one - and therefore deal only with a trustless, distributed, network like we have at the moment.

@_date: 2016-01-15 21:00:19
We must never forget that the primary function of bitcoin - trumping all others - is security; the rest are "nice to have".  Bearing this in mind, and that bicoin core is tried-and-tested-secure we must leave it alone - i.e. DON'T increase blocksize.  If faster transactions are needed then convert a few bitcoin to litecoin (this is why Lee created LiteCoin).  Leave bitcoin as it is - don't be fooled into hard-forking it into the hands of banksters - that would be fatal.
@_date: 2016-06-03 10:42:04
Indeed - one can easily extract funds / currency - but not gold.  Please read my post carefully - "redemption" implies the physical gold - as per the information on the BitGold site.  So, to make myself abundantly clear: 1. very difficult to redeem PHYSICAL GOLD - in fact I found this impossible; 2. Easy to withdraw fiat (£ or $).
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:46:28
Agree - greed and ignorance.

People, get a Trezor and take full control of your bitcoin.  Leaving them in trust with a third party is not wise practice.

@_date: 2016-06-02 23:57:18
I had £15,000 with bitgold.  I tried to redeem this as gold but the barriers erected prevented this.  The delays in communication during this period were deeply concerning.  I eventually gave up on the redemption process and withdrew the cash.  I wonder what will happen when the price of gold goes into the next (trajectory up) phase - I doubt you will get your gold and suspect your claim will be settled well below the reigning price - as has happened in similar situations in the past.  I would suggest "caveat emptor".

..... the force of growth in an inter-connected community - the world of human beings in this case - the nature (magnitude) of the exponential growth will be unique to the particular parameter being measured - for bitcoin that has been established - pretty much as it has been drawn in the graph (chart).

Got it to work now.  Uninstalled v0.12 (this did not erase the blockchain history - but had backed it up anyway) and then v0.13 worked fine.

Just remember one fundamental fact when dealing with bitcoin exchanges - they accept your fiat and CLAIM to buy bitcoin and then "store" it for you.  You have no proof they actually bought the bitcoin.  They could do this for many people (not buy the bitcoin) so that when people want bitcoin or fiat payout it would be the equivalent of a bank run - actually, not the equivalent - in fact, a real bank run.  Take-home-lesson - sure, buy bitcoin through an exchange but take immediate delivery into your own possession / wallet, preferably a Trezor or brain or paper wallet.

I have written half of each of the private key numbers down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope and sealed it with old-fashioned sealing wax and signed the envelope.  The other halves of the private keys I have sealed in triplicate in three separate envelopes and placed each of them with separate law firms.  The first envelope I keep in the top drawer of my desk (at home) and which I see at least three times a day - it the seal is broken I will change the wallets / private keys.  The family know about the envelope but will only find out that the other half of the private keys are with the lawyers when they open the home envelope (after my death).  The actual private keys - the whole private keys I hold in a brain wallet - i.e. I first generated 24 random words - remembered them - then generated the private keys from the memorable words (i.e. a brain wallet).  To generate 50 brain wallets I just added 1 ------ 50 to the end of the 24 words.  Brain wallet x 50.

I have been to blockchain.info to check the contents of these two addresses - nothing in the first one and only 0.0125431 in the second with an unconfirmed transaction of minus 0.01269.  Is this correct?  If you have any other addresses you can check their contents by going to     If you do have a significant sum in any wallet, if you are having trouble with Armory / bitcoit.qt, why not just sweep the contents of any address of yours into an Electrum wallet - simple to do if you have the private key.

Question: "Can bitcoin experience the equivalent of a bank-run".
Answer: Technically no.  But, the other day I was thinking - is it NOT impossible that an exchange could accept your money (say USD) and "look after your "bitcoin" for you - but, in fact, it (the exchange) does not buy the bitcoin - they just keep your cash but don't buy bitcoin.  Think about it - it really is possible.  As I type, it is not impossible that, say, Coinbase does this when you buy bitcoin and leave it with them to "store safely".  Remember, when you go to withdraw bitcoin from your account with Coinbase or Uphold you don't get it (the bitcoin) immediately.  They, of course, say that it takes time to "process the request".  So, bottom line, I do believe a bank run on bitcoin is possible - but only for bitcoin that you THOUGHT you owned.  So, this sort of bank run on bitcoin would INCREASE its price.

@_date: 2016-10-18 16:46:42
Indeed.  This all makes me rather suspicious.  The most important feature of bitcoin is its safety - and this depends on the distributed network - anything that interferes with that will interfere with its security.  The original bitcoin is tried and tested - I say don't interfere with it - find other solutions to supporting heavier traffic - like, say, Kim Dotcom's bitcache.  Don't interfere with bitcoin's distributed network - if you do, you will do so at its peril.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:26:05
So much hogwash - I really can't believe anyone can be so thick - so have to assume this is another bankers' shill - trying to sew fear to destabilise bitcoin.  They won't, because there is an enormous core of bitcoiners that do understand (and therefore most don't respond to cr*ap like this).  If anyone has a problem with speed of transaction - pay for it - as simple as that.  This will be the solution.  I am no longer going to waste my time with stupid, fear-mongering journalism like this. Cheerio.

Moral of the story - DON'T LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN WITH A THIRD PARTY .... ALWAYS take them into your posession.
