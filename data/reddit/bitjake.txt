Yes! Sorry about that.

I got to buy 0.1 btc at 10500. Pretty happy with that one ! :)
Edit for clarity. I meant I bought my BTC at the rate at 10500 pr BTC. So I paid roughly 1050.

No one is claiming the scalability issue is solved in at /bitcoin. Maybe lightning network will fix it but who knows when it will be ready?

I use smartbit api to check balances on addresses using either JavaScript or php. I’m sure someone you know with web development skills can help you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:21:47
Lol. It literally have 'andreas' in the bitcoin address itself.

Did I miss it already?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:38
You just buy here too ! :)

Oh my god, they got his name wrong in the article. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:59:24
I just want the little dude. :(

He’s also not the only candidate supportive of Bitcoin. Andrew yang accepts crypto for his campaign, and he actually has a very extensive platform!

I wanna build a treat dispenser for my dog, which I can activate from work and why not build it with lightning? Thanks for sharing !

My bank too. I’m currently not in the country so when I had to buy crypto I needed to have a conversation with them to confirm the transfer. They’re trying real hard to make crypto look bad. Even mentioned that I shouldn’t buy bitcoin cause it crashed. “Crashed? You mean it’s on sale, which is why we’re having this conversation!” xD

Haha! Are you a dad? :)

Whoa, what a little sour strawberry we have here. There's nothing wrong about being specific about who auction their house in bitcoin, even if you don't like the people.

Terrible. This episode has honestly discredited the whole show for me. If they're wrong about stuff I know about, how can I know they are not wrong about stuff I don't know about?

You're probably aware of "Banking on Bitcoin" which is also on Netflix. It might not be the best, but it's quite alright.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:15:45
You need to do world wide transactions almost everyday? Why?
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:50:27
Arh, I see. Thanks for clarifying that for me.

Currently the exchange rate on bitcoinvenezuela is roughly $250.000

I'm just happy it was "Cash Bitcoin" and not "Bitcoin Cash"

You can do this with american dollars. In many other countries this would invalid the bill. I remember this as I drew on a 100 danish crowns bill when I was a kid. My mom had a fit, and we went to the bank to have it replaced.

I am super excited about 10k! I have a long running bet with a mate, that we won’t shave until it has reached 10k. if one shaves, that will have to pay 0.1 btc to the other. I cannot wait to have a meal without eating away at moustache and look like a bum. Also, in laws is visiting tomorrow. Haha.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:13:13
Thank you so much for the free sticker!
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:20:12
No, not to replace but to be an alternative.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:58:48
Stay away from Bitcoin.com - In short it's a scam site.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:26:33
This is so lame. It’s not hard to hodl.

I'm from Denmark and I got a free Bachelors degree while receiving roughly $800 dollars a month from the state. Every student in Denmark who is +18 gets this, and people are very happy with the high taxes in order to enjoy the benefits of a healthy, educated population. I now live in the states, and the culture difference was honestly a bit of a shock to me. Americans say they value freedom, but 8/10 american workers say the live paycheck to paycheck. They can't afford to educate them selves without a huge loan, if you get sick you are screwed financially. Where is the freedom in that system?
