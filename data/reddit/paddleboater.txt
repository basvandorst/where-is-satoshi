So TeamShelter decides to build a rowboat with their limited resources and launches into the ocean.  They soon become dehydrated and the sharks start circling.  Meanwhile TeamWater finishes the well without the additional resources that TeamShelter would have provided.  Everyone drinks water and construction of a small shelter finally begins.  
In the distance a fleet of paddle boats suddenly appears.  "Hey guys! Check out these paddle boats, they even come with fishing rods and a canopy so you can paddle wherever you want by yourself if you like!  Try it!"
"Paddle boats are a scam!  If a boat doesn't have a motor, it's not a boat!" yells one of the islanders.
"Alright whatever, have fun on your island!"  And the team of paddle boats float away.
Next a hovercraft appears on the horizon, with a young captain at the helm.  "Ahoy there islanders!" says the young captain.  "Check out this hovercraft we built, anyone need a ride?"
Someone from TeamWater yells back, "No thanks, we can build our own hovercraft factory some day so your hovercraft will become irrelevant!  The only way to survive is on this island!"  And so the hovercraft floats away.
The islanders finish a small shelter.  They sit around the fire at night and assure each other that anyone out at sea has most certainly died.
The rowboat sinks and the remaining members of TeamShelter are captured by banker pirates.
The paddle boaters keep to themselves, content with what they have and hoping that one day people will realize the sovereignty provided by a paddle boat.
The hovercraft docks at the nearest city and starts giving rides to passengers, who love it and invite all their friends to invest in the hovercraft company.
Today, when tourists decide to visit the ocean, they pick whatever they want to do.  Some enjoy visiting desert islands, some like paddle boats, and others enjoy hovercraft cruises.
