A forum is a place of discussion. You would know that if you were educated. 
Reddit is a forum. 
This particular forum is dedicated to a topic. Of which your contribution is zero. 
Do you have anything of value to say or are you just a sad little boy that likes to sling insults?

Ugh. I see what you don’t seem to understand. 
Talking about an investment is one thing. 
But what if you told everyone about an investment. And your circle of friends is all low income earners. “Trash” you called them. 
So you are talking to some people at a bar maybe one night. Your investment is in IBM. Everything seems normal. 
Then next year they IBM stock goes up 50,000% people know you are now in a while diff ballpark. 
Except this is magic ibm stock that’s as good as cash. 
They want it from you. 
So it is harmless to talk about at TODAYS rate because you and I can’t afford much of it. But if tomorrow it’s worth $1,000,000 then suddenly all the people around us will turn and remember.  The trash.
That’s the danger you don’t seem to understand. Zombies.

I think it was very bold and smart of them to setup an exchange at ground zero NYC and do all the regulations and get backing from old money. 
It legitimizes the space in the eyes of the people who matter. 
It puts bitcoin into the spotlight at the most exclusive parties. 
Money is political and those people, like it or not, are in positions of influence over senators and governments all over the world. 
It was very smart to bring them into the game. Get them greedy and hungry.  Then they won’t be fighting against you. They will be fighting along side you.

The $92M on a military parade? What a waste. The billions in subsidies for the corn and oil companies. The unlimited funds for the military. 
All that could be tapped for paying for healthcare and education to make it cost nothing for the people who use it.  We would not need to raise taxes on anyone. Just reallocate the money into the social services sector instead of giving it to corporations and the military industry. 
If the population is healthy and well educated then they can make better informed decisions about government and policy. If they are sick and trapped in their low income job then they are stuck doing whatever their corporate masters tell them. 
The best thing for everyone is if everyone is healthy and intelligent and strong. 
But selfish people like yourself don’t understand the importance of a shared society. You just want it all for yourself and do not care about anyone else. Even though the most selfish and beneficial thing you could do is make sure that society functions optimally for all strata of people. That protects your wealth more than anything else. 
But, they don’t teach you that on Fox News.

Sounds like you are saying that wealthy people live in a bubble of reality and don’t interact with “common” people so they don’t run the risk of having to get in trouble. 
But some people on this planet like common people. Some want to remain friends with common people after BTC moons and not be treated differently by people. 
Many people realize that being rich doesn’t make you a better person than someone who isn’t. It just means you have more gas in your car and can do more to help others. 
But if everyone you meet treats you diff because they know you have more gas then they judge you by your resources, not your character. All your friends are bought.  Except the other rich ones. So you band together and live in a bubble. 
So the argument I am making is the argument that maybe wealth should be kept a secret so that there is no risk of anything happening to you if you of associate with common “trash”

300k satoshi at $0.01 per satoshi is $3k per person. When BTC is worth $1,000,000
That means that when 1 sat = $1 then BTC is $100,000,000 per.  And at that point each person only has $300k with perfect distribution.  
That’s not a fine enough granularity. 
We will need sub-satoshi because micropayments under a penny are needed for machine to machine commerce.

Hence my point is: why would you announce to anyone that you have BTC? That was the original topic.
You do understand right that many people are going to be thrust into sudden fortunes and when the masses wake up one day and see BTC is worth $1,000,000 they are going to remember old Larry from the mail room who always went on and on about bitcoin back in 2015 and how he has 1,000 of them. They are going to start talking and scheming ways to make some money off of him.  Some of Larry’s old colleagues at work maybe didn’t like him. Maybe they think that they should just take from him.  Well it’s damn good thing that Bill over in HR knows Larry’s house. And look there’s Larry’s Facebook page with a picture of his kid... I wonder how much bitcoin Larry would transfer to see his kid again ?

No, just no. 
ZERO cost. No health insurance. Eliminate that burden on society and health costs plummet. 
We do not need a body of people evaluating our worthiness for medicine. 
What’s next after fat? Gay? Should we discriminate against gay people too? How about women ? Women have babies and that increases medical costs. Should we force a premium on them too? What about people with pre existing conditions? What about black people who have a higher risk of certain heart defects? How about people with genetic disorders that increases their likelyhood to get cancer?  The elderly? Charge them all premiums too??
Your argument gives an entity the right to say some people are more deserving than others because you are so selfish that you think your money should be spent only on people who deserve healthcare by your standards. 
NO NO NO. You are still thinking along the lines of health insurance. 
We have social security and fire and police and military. We all pay into a pool. Everyone is covered. That is the way to do healthcare. 
Because if we let people like you make decisions about who is “allowed” to have healthcare then we end up with a fractured society where some people get treated more fair than others. 
Does this mean your taxes go for unhealthy people? Yes. But not much. You pay a hell of a lot more for the health insurance company’s annual CEO bonus. 
Universal healthcare. No middle man. Taxes pay the hospital directly. Hospital bills brought in line with the rest of the world prices. None of this $50,000 for an ambulance bullshit.

Should we discriminate against them too ? If your answer is yes then you would feel right at home in Nazi germany. They had the same ideas. 
Just pay for everyone else regardless of how they live. It’s cheaper than the current system of for profit health care where we pay for health insurance companies to deny coverage.
Some of these fatties contribute to your life in other ways.  They write amazing code that makes reddit work for example.  They may even be your friends. 
It’s not up to you to judge. Being sick and fat sucks. Being sick makes it hard to exercise. It’s a downward spiral. They can’t get the help they need because it costs money to seek help. So they put it off and get more sick. 
This expectation that just because you can do it everyone else should too is bullshit and selfish as fuck. 
Some people just have a hard hand in life. We should all pool together to help those that need help. 
Single payer makes it so that people are not tied to their employer for healthcare insurance. This allows for people to quit abusive employers and seek alternative employment without risk of losing coverage for their families. This allows people to participate in political dissent without risk of job loss and in turn health insurance loss. 
The current system fucks over most people.  You do not get to decide who gets healthcare and who does not. Fat, young, old, gay, straight, black, white, whatever. It’s all about taking care of each other. It’s the morally correct thing to do and it’s the American thing to do.

That’s not practical. You need the services they provide in a modern society. You need a place to store your wealth as well as an easy way to access it and move it around. Yes BTC can do that. But not as easily for most people and certainly not as frictionless. 
It’s like saying “you are free to not use the internet if you don’t like your ISP terms of service” 
Well yes, true. I could not use the internet. But then I couldn’t do my job. So I need the internet to do my job. Therefor I am beholden to the isp terms of service. I can’t say no. 
Similarly for banks. You can’t say no.

I am not defending any party.  I am saying that the gop and the religious right are committing crimes against humanity currently. 
You need to stop defending that. 
I am sure there are very nice religious people in religious churches of all denominations and faiths. I have no issue with religious beliefs. I have issue with religious leaders pushing political ideas and rallying their base to commit atrocities. 
Your book says to help the weak and the poor and to take immigrants and treat them as friends. To love thy neighbor. So fucking do it. Stop preaching to me on the internet. Get your church to the border and get those kids out of prison. Reunite them with their parents.  
Do the moral thing 
Oh and for the record you don’t need a book to tell you what is right or wrong.  You can feel it. It’s called being an empathic person. 
I am not religious but I don’t fuck kids because fucking kids is gross. Why would anyone want to do that ?  You don’t need a book to tell you how to be a good person. Just common sense.

I was founder and CTO. Both were exited successfully.  You probably don’t know anything about coding so I won’t bother trying to explain it to you. But see, those of us that know how tech works can make things that work on this thing called the I N T E R N E T.  Say it with me.  Internet. And when you make a cool thing that people like they give you money. Turns out that if they like it a lot someone comes along and buys your company for a lot of money. Neat huh? 
So ya, you could say I earned it. But it’s easy when you know what you are doing.

To answer your first part: no, as a business owner I will pocket the extra cash and minimally invest in economic expansion using robots or overseas labor.

To which I reply: you are sick in the head.
You should consider that we all can work less when we take care of each other. Being a selfish cunt is very small minded and fails all levels of moral decency. You have a pile of gold but do not care if others can not go to the doctor. Because “sucks for them, you got yours”

Why would a health insurance company cover sick people? That’s a terrible business model. They want to pool together people who are healthy and only a few sick people because then they can make a profit. 
I’m saying let’s cut out the insurance company.  Pool EVERYONE together. Use that money to pay for sick people and cover everyone else for emergencies too. 
As for the VA. Ya, total garbage because the pool is too small. 
Just go look at Canada or England or basically anywhere else to see it working correctly. 
By your logic If health is an investment then going to the doc early is also prudent. But if you are poor and doctors are expensive and screening procedures are expensive then you CANT go. 
So problems compound and people get sicker. Eventually ending up in the ER. Where your taxes have to pay anyhow. But now much much more.

While money itself is imaginary there is also the fact that we use it as a means of measuring trade. Trade is the root imaginary concept but necessary for civil social structures based on our Ape brain concepts of fairness and trust.  Beehives do not need this for example, nor the cells in your body as they operate as a single organism.  Because humans do not operate as a single entity we use trade as a mechanism of securing resources for the individual. This imaginary concept of fairness is what gives rise to the liquidity of money in that trade. 
Symbolic issuance of that value transfer be it paper notes, bars of metal, stones, shells, or more modern - bits in a computer; that is the deeper confusion that the population consumes. Often mistaking the symbol of value for value itself.

if it makes you feel any better it's pretty fast for SWIFT banks to transfer money within the EU and Asian countries. it's pretty much shit for the USA banking system though.

I’m not a skeptic. I’m a technologist.

Evil Entity wants to push people away from BTC so they hire a bunch of hackers to build malware that sneaks into LN wallets and lays dormant, after a number of years it wakes up and simultaneously starts broadcasting all the old state data from all the past transactions.  Suddenly the penalties start kicking in. Everyone’s channels start getting closed out. It’s chaos. Money is lost on a massive scale. Panic sets on the market and people lose confidence. Everyone switches over to Evil Entity’s new and secure Custodial Service.

No, they do not require a secure transport layer to send a message. They encrypt the message on the recipient’s public key and they can only be decrypted by the recipient. Each end keeps an encrypted copy that can only be read on that device.  Your whole slew of technobabble is nonsense.  You can get entropy data from ambient mic noise, camera, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and thermal noise, as well.

Supply rate is 12.5 new bitcoins minted every 10 minutes.  In 199 days the algorithm automatically  changes that to 6.25 every 10 minutes. This is baked into the code and can not be changed. It does this “halvening” on average every 4 years. 
Economically it means the available supply Of new coins gets cut in half. Miners spend same energy for less reward.

Most importantly: youngsters. 
Kids who are growing up today are unbanked and digital natives. They add playing video games with their friends and earning loot. They have found that they can sell that loot for BTC. They do not see any reason to have a bank account as it is slow and cumbersome.  As they grow up and become adults they will be very comfortable with the technology. Adoption is organic.

I think central exchanges will cease to be a thing in a few years. DEX will continue though. But more likely is that a few mature blockchains will emerge and cross chain atomic swaps will be built into the base protocol layers so that no exchange is needed. The chains themselves will settle with each other. 
Ultimately though at the base protocol later level the mixing needs to happen.  Not at the user level.
Edit: one area where centralized exchanges will still continue to server a function is as fiat to crypto gateways and for institutional investment houses.

You really haven’t studied the deeper cryptographic mathematics of how privacy can work while preserving audit capabilities that the supply has not been inflated have you?
If you can prove a transaction is valid and that it has not spent coins that do not exist WITHOUT REVEALING the amounts of those transactions or the addresses of the parties involved you can deduce that no new coins have been created artificially. 
The math is way more complex than that. But if you want to know more google it. 
Other coins already implement this feature.  I’m saying bitcoin should too.

Criminals can know your financial affairs in a public system. 
Privacy is a right. 
Fuck equality. That’s a myth. The world isn’t equal. What you want is fairness. And in a private system FAIRNESS is baked into the system. In a public system surveillance is baked into the system which means you can be controlled. Public record of private citizen’s finances is the antithesis of a free society 
In a private by default system you can always opt to make some transactions public.  Like public officials. Or corporate earnings.  But you can’t make privacy optional or then it makes people suspect of the private transactions. 
How do you feel if someone asks you to post your bank records &amp; cc statements online ?
Anyhow, you won’t see any widespread use of BTC until privacy is the norm. All you will see is centralized HODL in exchanges, where ironically, it is private - except for the exchange. So we are just back to banks holding your money. Only now the bank is called Coinbase and if that happens Bitcoin failed because it’s no better — in fact worse — than a centrally controlled fiat due to inefficiency.

Are you fucking kidding me? The internet started with ARPAnet in the 1960s. The internet as we know it didn’t happen until the mid 1990s with the invention of mosaic graphical web browser. Before that we had dialup BBS and Gohernet connecting text based sites on 56k modems. “The internet” was AOL and Compuserve for most of the 1980s. Giant silo’d datacenters with walled off users.  University students were lucky to have time on the VAX to access the real internet which only connected a handful of institutions together.  It required knowing how to configure your own gateways and telnet was king. 
It wasn’t even until the late 2000s that broadband became widely available. 
Even today the internet is too damn slow and clunky. Decades still until it’s instant.

How much money is in your bank account and what bank do you use?
That's basically the problem with transparent chains.  If you send me funds I can see how much you have left over (change address).  That means if you buy something from me I can see your balance for the next time we do business I can see how much you have in your address and set my price accordingly.  This can be done automatically because when you buy from me you give me an identifier (email) and the transaction gives me all the details to know at least one of your addresses.  From that I can see your change address, log it, and the next time you come to my site I can check your email against my database and lookup your change address, check how much is in there and adjust my prices up accordingly because I know exactly how much you have.

Two points I would remind you:
1. The internet was not built with privacy and security on the base layer. So now we have eons of privacy and data security issues to deal with as we try to patch this thing after the fact.  This is an ass backwards way to do things. Email, is clear text and it has every fucking bank balance sent to you every month. All your purchases. Who you correspond with. Etc.  as a consequence of this lack of privacy there is a huge market for data brokers to sell your information and hackers stealing your data. It’s a fucking mess.  Had privacy been built into the core protocol everyone would be in charge of their own data and the internet would not be such a massive surveillance tool. 
2. Aside from Mimble Wimble. Which is a nice patch. What are your thoughts on a PURE privacy crypto such as Monero which as privacy by default thus ensuring fungibility?  Monero achieves both privacy while also remaining auditable. If they can do it BTC can do it too.

I’m more concerned about casual parties I come into contact with knowing my financial affairs than I am with governments. Although depending on the government they alarm me as well. 
Privacy is an important component of fungibility.  Without it some coins can be blocked and tainted by governments which reduces the value of your coinage.
If the goal is financial freedom from centralized banks and a fully autonomous Trustless / permissionless system of financial security then privacy is essential for fungibility.
Otherwise, you basically just want Libra. A centrally controlled regulated money supply with lower fees than visa.

Do not make any duplicates except by your own hand and pen.  Laminate the paper. Store it like you would store cash.  That paper IS your wallet. It’s ok to lose or destroy the Trezor. Do not lose the paper with the seed phrase.  After that just follow the directions on screen. EZ

Pretty obviously no reason for cloud mining to exist. If I can mine and make money with mining hardware why would I share the profits with you?
The correct vehicle for investing in mining if you don’t want to do it yourself would be a classical stock purchase on a regulated mining corporation listed on the NASDAQ where stock value directly correlates to profits from the mining corporation. Transparent books and clear accounting. 
Purchasing mining hardware in a cloud scenario makes no sense at all.

You buy gold bond certificates and hold them in brokerage. Then you sell the gold cert bonds for actual gold at 1:1 value for actual gold once you are at your new location.
Obviously bitcoin is superior because you don’t have to do any of that mess.

As a currency bitcoin itself needs to be faster. LN needed. Also you wouldn’t want a currency to show who is using it. Privacy is important for commerce. Otherwise business competitors can see the supply chain of their competition. 
So this whole argument is moot. You don’t need to see where it’s being used. Just ask if someone is willing to accept it as payment for a transaction. If yes, then it was used. 
But as of right now we really need LN for widespread adoption. It’s painfully slow to use BTC for a transaction in its current state.
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:28:00
It’s locked on chain with a BTC opcode. The two parties exchange signed updates to who owes each other what.  at any time either party can publish their contract to the blockchain and claim the funds. However only the MOST RECENT contract has priority.  So if you publish a contract that says you keep 5 BTC and I keep 0 and I have a more recent signed contract from you that says you keep 2 BTC and I keep 3 then mine is the only one that counts. The contract that is most recent and is signed wins. 
The BTC moves according to the contract that’s published. 
The speed of LN is that the back and forth negotiations between you and I can be done thousands and thousands of times between the two of us. Each one we just sign off on between us. But we only publish the most recent version.  So between us we can do millions off chain negotiations then when we settle we just publish one transaction.  Make sense? Bitcoin is still securing the BTC.  LN is just a protocol for quickly resolving who gets what but we can delay the actual transaction on chain until a later date. The funds are secure and never leave the bitcoin blockchain. 
Then taken a step further, nodes can act as middle men between other notes. This is the Network component of LN.  Multiple nodes shifting balances around between each other such that you and I don’t have to know each other if we know one or more parties between us. 
The algorithm finds nodes that are linked. This is automatic. 
I’m not an expert. This is just my understanding. If someone else has deeper knowledge please feel free to jump in.

Just like most people don't care how web pages load or what an https is or what TLS is or what TCP/IP is.  It's protocol level stuff.  We need it to be as EASY as possible for people to understand that Bitcoin is still Bitcoin even if the protocol is enhanced under the hood.

Satoshi’s stash isn’t large enough to come out of hiding yet. He would only come out when the stash creates his net worth to be in the trillions.

You don’t need to move the physical gold. You just need a certificate in your online brokerage. 
Edit: to those downvoting this you clearly don’t understand the reality of moving physical gold across borders. Good luck lugging it through airport security.  The smart money will use institution for a few days to move the assets with an IOU and then withdraw on the other end.

Also, you neglected to mention that this was possible on Ethereum for two reasons:
1. When this happened Ethereum was still very young. It was decided that it was better to make the change and fix the bug and roll back the transactions while it was still possible or else when PoS went live there would be one bad actor with a HUGE amount of stake. 
2. Ethereum has a figure which is seen as a leader. Vitalik can sway people’s opinions. So politics is centralized more so than in Bitcoin. The best thing Satoshi ever did to protect bitcoin’s decentralized politics was vanish.

Because for 1Btc to equal $1,000,000 it means that the cost of things had to increase radically in terms of usd if usd was inflated to that level if we go by the ops original premise that USD is inflating to $1,000,000 per BTC.
printing more USD would make BTC worth more USD.  But it would also mean that prices in USD would go up to match inflation since the USD would be worth less.
What everyone wants is for BTC to rise in purchasing power and for USD to remain where it is in purchasing power such that 1BTC is worth $1,000,000 of today's purchasing power, but that's not what op said.

Buying and controlling the supply is a good start and they will attempt to do that. That’s economics. That’s to be expected. But they can ban it. 
Flip the script.  The DeFi protocols being built in ETH are doing business use cases. Companies like Microsoft and Google are building on frameworks on this stuff.

You have absolutely no idea how most of the world lives do you? They live paycheck to paycheck with negative funds left over at the end of the month. Many of them have to chose between food and medicine. They don’t have any money to buy bitcoin with. But if the system goes down their houses will be lost. Their jobs will be erased. 
You can’t fix the problem with a stupid little platitude like “buy bitcoin” that’s fine if you are lucky enough to have extra funds to buy with. But the vast majority of people do not have the luxury of little things like eating and sleeping. Ya ignorant. 
Have some compassion before you go knocking down the house have a damn solid plan for what you are going to do with the millions of people your egalitarian idiocy will leave homeless.

owning an economy is a hell of a lot different than solving a fundamental computer science problem.  just because you are not a computer scientist doesn't mean that it's a conspiracy.  have you even read satoshi's white paper?  It's common to ascribe conspiracy to things we don't understand.  But there is a clear and well documented technology path as to where crypto came from as well as source code and many other measurable historical artifacts.
Cryptocurrency is NOT what bankers made, they are good at laws and twisting governments but they are not technologists.  Are you even aware of tech like mimblewimble or privacy coins?  What central bank would want untracable invislbe digital cash?  It's not something they want.
Bankers made JPMorgan coin.

You are spinning bullshit. This isn’t a double agent nonsense. People were working on tech like bitcoin before bitcoin. EGold for example.  They all failed because they were centralized. Satoshi was the first to put components from prior projects together in such a way that he solved a fundamental problem in computer science “the Byzantine generals problem” 
Even then, when it first came out in 2009 there was a huge amount of skepticism that it would even work. The initial value was Zero. It was 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas that set the initial calculation for valuation.  Follow up valuation and market use came from the black market. Drugs, murder, etc.  the Silk Road, etc. 
Bankers would just advertise it as theirs if they wanted people to use it.  They do not control it. They do not control the mining.  In fact, they tried for a long time to say it was a fad or that it was a ponzi, anything to get people to NOT use it. 
Now they are trying to play catch up.  They are buying up position. The same way they do in gold and diamonds. 
So no, it’s not a fucking conspiracy. It’s just good ol’ computer science. 
Read the fucking history.  Read the white paper. Educate yourself.  This happened because of some very smart people who were fed up with the central bankers.  What you are saying discredits their efforts. So fuck you for that.

Millions of people hungry, power moves by huge juggernaughts steping up to try to seize control and promising to "fix" the situation with even more draconian measures.  
What you are advocating: The collapse of the existing financial system.  It will hurt common people a HELL of a lot more than it will hurt the ultra rich.
What would happen is that the system would go on fire-sale and the ultra rich would buy it up and rewrite the rules even more in their favor.
You are a selfish prick.
All because you want bitcoin to win?  Well guess what, the system doesn't have to fail for bitcoin to win.  Just like you don't have to die for your antibiotics to work.

If you want a secure border then use drones and sensors.  A physical wall is expensive and does not actually accomplish the intended goal.

It will end up never being finished and a perpetual money sink where private contractors (in some way connected to Trump or his cronies) will forever be “working on it” and it will NEVER be done. You will pay for that way for generations. 
AND it won’t stop the influx of illegal immigrants.

No, that is a lie. What actually happened is that the Republican Congress refused to pass a budget and instead shut down the government and then blamed Obama.   They also obstructed even holding hearings for a Supreme Court justice and instead left the seat vacant for a year in clear dereliction of their duties as congressmen because of racism towards Obama.  The Republican Party only cares about securing power for the Republican elites. They do not care about the republic nor do they care about you.  All of their policies are directly related to tipping the system in the favor of the ultra rich and powerful. Go look it up. 


Lies, they do not work. They have never worked in any country in history.  


No, the waste is the government spending trillions on war when we don’t even have decent free healthcare or education.  Higher level education is free in Germany. Healthcare is inexpensive or free in the rest of the world. The reason things cost so much in America is because of the for profit systems where we literally are paying extra to make CEOs rich so they can deny us healthcare when we need it. 


Stop lying. 
You should care that you are being taxed to pay for Wall Street banker’s mistakes and for sending missies into other countries in order to secure the USD as global reserve currency.  That costs a hell of a lot more than some tacos. How about you put your money where your mouth is and compete as a CAPITALIST with Juan ? If he’s willing to do the same job for less money then you shouldn’t get the job, he should. 
As far as Juan using our healthcare system. We ALL should be able to use it and we all should pay together.  Juan will pay taxes too if you let him. 
You are a selfish person who doesn’t understand that you are not in a vacuum. If Mexico does well we also do well. 
I urge you to stop being so terrified of “socialism” why don’t you instead think of it as “democratic capitalism” because that’s what it is.

Your employer will want to deduct the amount he pays you from his income as an expense to himself in order to lower his own taxable income.  He will report the dollar amount that was paid to you.  It doesn’t matter if you were paid in bitcoin or dollars you will have to report to the irs your income in usd terms.  If BTC appreciates before you pay your taxes you will owe additional taxes on top of your income taxes as capital gains tax on the difference between the cost basis you were paid it at and the value you sold it at. If it depreciates before you pay your taxes you will still owe taxes on the USD amount reported by your employer.

The night king rolls up on cerci and SHE kills him to everyone’s surprise! Many bend the knee to her after that. John and a few loyal to him are on the run, cerci hunts him. 
Then the ragtag remaining heroes get their asses kicked by cerci but then Arya finally defeats cerci in the end via sneak attack but with great cost, she also dies when just after she finishes watching cerci bleed out a cruel grin creeps over cerci’s face as she dies. Just then the mountain comes out of nowhere and impales arya raising her to the sky and cutting her in half!  The eyes of both Arya and Cerci lock as they lay on the floor dying together.

False. Workers unions give the workers collective bargaining powers to push back against the owners of capital that otherwise do not care about poor working conditions and will force people to work in unsafe conditions for minimal earning. 


You are lying. The democrats have not shut down the government. 
Also, walls do not work. 
Also, what a colossal waist of tax dollars. 


Yes, that was a stupid move on their part. 


I am also a capitalist but I understand that capitalism is an imperfect system and if left unchecked it devolves into ruthless greed. There needs to be social safety nets for people that are not as good at the game as myself, such as you. 
We currently socialize corporate losses while pushing for capitalism for everyone else.  Let’s flip that. 
A healthy and well educated population is a stronger work force that is better able to compete in a global economy.  Lack of higher level education and free healthcare means that the population is working sick and infected with superstition and lack of critical thinking skills. A republic operates best with an educated voting block.

He’s not wrong.  Gold is not easy to transact with.  So it’s not a good global currency.  Plus gold isn’t backed by anything. It’s just a lump of shiny metal. It doesn’t travel very far or very fast. 
The USD is backed by the military and GDP of the USA and it’s ability to tax it’s citizens. 
Bitcoin is backed by energy expenditure and the laws of physics and it is still evolving.

Some people are outside of USA and therefor have different time zones. “Tomorrow” is relative. An actual date and time and time zone is far more useful.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:47:02
Yup, big mess

Recognize BTC as the “also global reserve currency” do not abandon the dollar. Just give it competition.

What country ?
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:08:28
I think once LN becomes super easy to use that Satoshis will be considered currency. 
This will cause confusion because bitcoin will still be considered property. 
Lol - politicians.

Dude.. get a grip. 
Seriously. 
There are people in the world with no shoes and no food and you are miserable because you have so much money you don’t know what to do with it?!
Fuck off

If the USA makes a law that trading BTC for USD is illegal then it will be extremely difficult to spend your BTC on things like lambos because no businesses will accept them and no exchanges will trade them for USD.
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:21:51
Plus what date is this? 111111?
You need 4 digit year to have a marker that lets you know. “Oh this is y m d format”
But without the 4 digit year you are just fucked.

Exactly what happened every other time

Be careful what you wish for. 
Collapse of systems are often replaced by even harsher ones
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:20:05
Yes. Of which he violates by going yymmdd instead of 4 digit year.

The seed phrase
You write it down when you initialize the device. 
If the hardware fails or is lost you can enter that seed phrase into a new hardware device and all your keys are restored. 
DO NOT EVER EXPOSE THAT SEED PHRASE TO AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE! Use a pen. Write it old school style.

Clearly you are not a programmer or you would understand the appeal of ETH as a touring complete system with support on MSDN and you do not understand the appeal of custodial systems to the majority of people who can’t and won’t want to manage their own keys and do not understand the diff between btc and BTC-IOU that bankers will love to fill the roll of. 
Calling us stupid for not being zealots shows your ignorance to the larger world economics. 
But I hope you are right. I hope it’s all BTC. I like BTC a lot.

Where do you keep all those people ? Basement ?

Can we? Because that’s a good idea if that’s viable
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:22:47
This is a great idea! Needs to be stickied

How would you suggest that works with putting limit orders to buy or sell at specific price points?
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:30:30
If you live in the USA be aware that the tax laws stipulate that you need to pay taxes in USD on the USD value of that BTC as gains from those Alts you traded. 
Be careful.
