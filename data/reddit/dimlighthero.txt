This would be a fair counterargument if the Greeks only received the right to vote fairly recently. But since Greece has had a parliamentary democracy since 1975 the greek citizenry has had a say in their economic direction for ample time to evade this terrible fate. 
I get it though, when one politician promises more than the other you don't question if it is a sustainable strategy. You just vote for the politician that offered you more. It is happening nearly everywhere.

I think you meant to reply on the comment above me right? If not, could you elaborate please?

How much blame can you put on a single elected official though? At some point you have to acknowledge that the responsibility in a democracy lies at least in part with the people.
 The Greek electorate shares in the blame because of they didn't elect leaders that were willing to make tough decisions. Obviously I understand that the Greeks aren't alone in this(we'll see when Holland runs out of gas or the uncompetitive French economy loses a large employer), but ultimately in a democracy the power and onus lies with us.

I disagree. The problem was caused by the recession, and exacerbated and amplified by frivolous government spending.

Nice write-up, the point you're making would benefit from having both graphs having roughly the same size. The absolute values graph dominates the page kinda.
