Not even close to true unfortunately.


What we have in the west is extremely close to modern day tyranny, we're just not being shot in the streets yet.
Does bitcoin offer any solutions to your raised problems? In the brief research I've done, most people just recommend localbitcoins for "anonymous"  usage combined with frequent address changes. However since theirs a record of all transactions, it seems it would be trivial to track users given the processing power available to governments. Are there any options for true anonymity within bitcoin?

Genius!!! It worked. I'm just waiting on the 48-72 hour wait now. If I get back in I'll definitely  send you some coinage. Thanks sooo much.

I'm glad to see a few more people telling it like it is.  Any proposed solutions or steps to a solution?

In order to use bitcoin directly as a currency,  we need to establish how much a bitcoin is worth in terms of goods and services,  create a baseline not pegged to the dollar.  ex:  .0000000001 bt  = a pack gum
.00000001 = a burger,  etc,  that would go a long way towards real world nom fiat use,  once ppl start to trust btx has non dollar value, we'll have real progress.

that's assuming that most users understand the code base and potential changes can be gradual, causing a failing system overtime

is mining still a thing?
at some point I'd have to spend fiat to get btc right? unless someone paid me in btc for a service,but how would I know if they didn't just buy their btc with fiat somewhere down the line?
