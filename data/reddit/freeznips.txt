I am all for privacy. Though, I live in the States where it is entirely unrealistic to expect to be able to use an alternate currency and not report it/pay taxes on it.

Absolutely. I'm relatively new to crypto and I don't get how bitcoin can compete long term with these outrageous fees. I can to a bank wire transfer for less. It seems as though its only advantage is that is was first to market by a (relatively) long shot. Again, I'm pretty new to all this and don't claim to know squat. This is what it seems to me, though.

This is when I got in. Saw all the fuss and decided to educate myself. Truly incredible tech. I'm excited to watch it mature in my lifetime.

If you can propose an alternate solution that enables our privacy while also verifying we are paying taxes I would be 100% for that idea. To me it seems obvious that we need to pay taxes on this income and the gov't needs a way to verify we are doing that correctly. If one is anti tax then this bill is not the one they should be debating.

It seems like this is more of a sales tax issue then a btc regulation issue. I fall somewhere in the middle. I think there should be a static tax across all income ranges, and it should be applied only upon income or sales, not both. The tax system is certainly less than ideal, but this bill is no surprise given the current structure.

I disagree. Every technical advantage (anti-inflationary attributes, transaction times, liquidity, global acceptance, etc..) is maintained. The only downside is the government knows how much you have and you have to pay taxes on that amount. I believe these are inevitable conclusions as crypto becomes more and more widespread.

False, not a ban. We should all be in favor of getting inevitable rules and regulations in place sooner rather than later. They only legitimize crypto further while still maintaining most of the advantages it has over fiat. Of course this was going to happen, we preach our end goal of crypto becoming the global currency yet we cry when governments recognize it as a global currency.

Nope, you're good. It is the same as transferring USD from one bank account to another, or from one stock exchange to another. So long as it remains fiat along the way. Where the grey area begins is when you buy crypto with crypto, it is taxable if the commodities are not "like kinds." I don't know of any 100% inclusive answer to this questions. However, one thing is for sure; when you trade the crypto for USD, or an item valued in USD, you definitely are required to pay taxes on it.

Looks like a Spartan action figure to me.

Wait is this real? You must pay, like, almost a grand in electricity? Wot?

I bought some bitcoin and tried to send you .00000001 btc for funsies but then I realized the transaction fee from bittrex is .001 so I didn't. Thanks anyways though =)
