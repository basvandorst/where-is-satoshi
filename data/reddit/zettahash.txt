I would rather the core devs work on core and *not* on securing and maintaining servers to operate a shitty GitHub alternative.
Git itself is decentralized. There's nothing that would prevent bitcoin from moving its codebase to another service if something went wrong. GitHub is a great company that has managed to maintain transparency through any takedowns. I haven't heard of any censoring outside of obscene/illegal content. They also keep a public repository listing [DMCA notices GitHub has received](

This article is ridiculous. Nobody was sentenced for helping ISIS with bitcoin. A dumb kid was sentenced to 11 years in prison for promoting violent extremists on Twitter and aiding his dumb friend in making a trip overseas to be recruited to kill people.

The SP50 (which I've now codenamed *The Bitcoin Mini-Fridge*) uses 16,570 W and takes up 11U of rack space. It's a pretty ridiculous increase in density, hash rate, and power efficiency. Compare it to their previously released [SP35]( which takes up 2U of space, draws 3,650 W, and hashes at 5.5 TH/s.
The Bitcoin Wine Cooler is unfortunately only sold in bulk. I hope Spondoolies will figure out a way to offer consumer mining hardware again without the support overhead that comes with it.
Bitmain might be the last man standing.
