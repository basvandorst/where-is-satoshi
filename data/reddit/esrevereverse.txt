...what about decades of experience in the business world?

No, no they definitely have not made tens of millions of profit. Just do some simple math. Average volume over a few years multiplied by their fee. It's peanuts, especially considering their server/dev costs and the fact that they have to pay multiple employee salaries. I wouldn't be surprised if they were spending more than they were earning.

I do. Why anyone trusts the government to handle their money responsibly is beyond me.

Showing your true colors I see. 
Yes, I am sure that the only "non-fake" news sources are the ones that align with your political beliefs. And but of course, the ones that don't align with your beliefs are hacks. /s
Would it hurt you to step outside of your cage for just one minute?

There are reputable and non-reputable sources on both sides.
Your first instinct was to rattle off a bunch of mild to heavy left-leaning outlets as examples of reputable sources, and claim that any journalists with integrity would never want to write for "hack rightwing" outlets.
Just sayin'.

Yes, I'm *sure* that the fabric of reality itself just happens to be aligned with your political beliefs. It *can't* be possible that you just have a hard time accepting that your thoughts and beliefs don't have ultimate say in the outcome of the universe. 
It's understandable. When you go through life with that idea, anyone that disagrees with you is just plain wrong and you never have to think about why. And maybe more importantly, you never actually have to consider why you are right.
That's truly one of the most idiotic things that a human being can say.

Every single one of those sources leans left.
