Seems like you're using your knowledge for good, kudos to you. Since you seem extraordinarily competent in this issue, what does someone with your knowledge do to protect his own passwords and more? What would you suggest to protect yourself from people with your knowledge and skills (and bad intentions)?  Thanks in advance!

Good ad hominem there again, shitlord

Yeah, because libertarians want gov healthcare and education, right? 
Sorry mate, most libertarians actually know nothing comes for free, so no, big gov and low taxes is not what those "middle class white libertarian kids and man-children" want, it's actually the exact opposite.

That man is Austin Peterson, probably the best candidate to ever enter the stage for people who value freedom. Support him!

I love how you didn't refute his points, because if you tried, your own poor moral logic would come out. 
Taxation however remains theft, for Milton himself it was rather a necessary evil (to keep the government running, which itself is a necessary evil to him, and I think Milton's proposed 10% flat tax is already as close to heaven as we Libertarians can realistically get it), which still doesn't change the fact that it's theft.

You really don't know where this argument leads do you? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:15:17
I'm sorry that the concept of theft apparently doesn't blow yours.
