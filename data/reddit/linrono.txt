I actually like Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon. Melissa McCarthy can be funny when she isn't just making fat jokes every 10 minutes. I am not very familiar with Leslie Jones and the writing of the Reboot doesn't feel like a great basis to judge her on. The problem, imo, was Paul Feig directing. Which came about because they wanted to make a all female cast Ghostbusters. Unfortunate.

I actually enjoyed that movie. While I have my problems with it as a reboot of a beloved franchise, it was fun and parts of it actually made me laugh. Here's your upvote, you bastard. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:15:35
I 100% percent agree with you about the black stereotype but I would direct you to the first Ghostbusters at Winston's own character and will say maybe not as stereotypical as the reboot, but a very poorly thought out character, with his occasional one liners and short words of wisdom. Unfortunately Hollywood as a whole is over sexualizing everybody so that's just something you're going to have to get used to. I mean, while Dana was a stronger female character than Chris she definitely was sexualized for the movie. Their main mistake, on top of those, was they made a children's movie. They wanted to sell toys cause that is where they made their money last time. The original series was a comedic SciFi adventure while the reboot felt more like a slapstick comedy fest with some over the top CGI to make it science fiction. They took the route of Big Bang Theory nerddom and made a full length movie out of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:31:24
Yeah, again, outside of his one liners and few words of wisdom, what do we even know about Winston's character outside of that he'll believe anything you say as long as you are paying him(another one liner). His character in the Reboot had more of an actual story around him. And what you are talking about regarding Chris being a sexual attraction is just like Peter and Dana. He was after her like a dog. And I agree with you on the original, my comment wasn't meant as a plus for the Reboot. It was a negative comment. And if you are saying Big Bang Theory has more respect for nerds and science than this movie did, makes me think you haven't watched BBT in a while.  I have been a huge Ghostbusters fan since I can remember, and TBH your last comment was genuinely and surprisingly hurtful. It's been fun.

Once you can make a snapshot that everyone can trust hasn't been tampered with, no fraudulent transactions or generated coins, blockchains won't be necessary anymore and that will fix a lot of problems we have with cryptocurrencies. Just not possible yet.

Actually posting a transaction of yours to reddit links your reddit account to a specific address. Then any incoming and outgoing transactions are then tied to that account as well. Take change addresses into account and any reoccurring payments and there is a lot of info to be gleaned there. Sure a regular user won't care but if he is subject to a background check for his transactions, blockchain analysis can use a lot of that info. Boom privacy leak. Not everyone takes privacy lightly.

They are pretty predictable. Once forked, if causing a chain split, the two forks don't matter to each other. Changes to consensus definitely can change as well. Can't truly work with what we don't know, we can only formulate a hypothesis from existing data. The whole point of the chain is to have the ability to verify your coins are valid since their creation. If a true pruning method comes in a safe manner one day then, yes, how we handle blockchains will definitely change.

The only thing that could be troublesome for you is if the funds are part of a tainted group of coins, such as stolen coins. People with stolen coins will sometimes just pass out small amounts while also trying to mix them to help hide the trail of coins. If they are part of tainted coins, and you use them or deposit them somewhere where they frown on those coins, you could have your account closed or frozen. Since you have a record of all of your other deposits, you might be okay. Don't consider them free money, nothing is free.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:33:50
Yes you can. Its very safe if you actually know and can trust the person you have a channel open with. Its not as safe as regular Bitcoin transactions as people can try to revert payments they've made to you by acting like they didn't happen. If you have a node online most of the time, your node can catch them doing this and can punish them. This can happen to any user of LN.

Sure SW softfork can happen without a hard fork and without risking creating two chains. The issue is that once some of those transactions start hitting the chain, we cannot go back because those transactions would be anyone can spend now. It's scary to think about if any issues arise.

If MultiBit HD doesn't have an option to import your private key, I'm fairly certain Electrum does. I use Electrum personally. Never imported a private key before myself so I don't know for sure. Though, if I'm not mistaken, once you import they key you shouldn't use that wallet anymore. I forget why but it's frowned upon. Also, the HD stands for the system that creates your key from the words that represent your private key. I forget what it stands for exactly.

I believe regular LN doesn't do a lot for privacy. The only thing it hides is every transaction with same channel. The only tx recorded are the opening and closing of channels. I could be wrong on that. MimbleWimble is a L2 solution that will help with privacy. Supposedly it can work with LN.

It is my understanding, and I believe I've seen some of the developers say the same thing, that core isn't really being designed to be a wallet anymore. They are expecting people to use third party wallets. The core system is really just for running nodes. Could be completely wrong though.

This is a great idea. The only issue is that if the device can be rooted and this custom ROM put on the device, then the phone could be rooted again. Once rooted again, the wallet becomes vulnerable to extraction. That's why current hardware wallets are not rootable in the same sense as android phones.

I think they are talking about -assumevalid= and then the block after that. Supposedly that will allow quicker validation of the chain after the specified block but you lose verification of the previous blocks.

Since the entirety of Trezor is fully open source and Ledger is not? Only thing I can come up with. I'm fairly certain available attacks on Trezors are countered by use of 25th seed phrase passwords since they are not stored on the device. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:39:41
The second question talks about how the device uses a secure element which is essentially a proprietary chip that they have not released exactly what it does or what it can do, AFAIK. They believe it makes their devices stronger. Some people have spoken out against it saying it is less secure since it cannot be audited. There are definite security trade offs regarding the inclusion of the chip. Whether or not it is a bad thing is up to the user to decide. I personally don't like the idea of storing large amounts of money on a device where I can't check exactly what it is doing at all times, but I also think chances are pretty slim this will ever be a large scale problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:59:25

IOS isn't exclusively designed for storing large amounts of value so the trade off isn't as significant. Open source allows anyone to audit code, including yourself. If you understand code you can know exactly what a device is doing and not treat it like some magic box that does certain things when you interact with it and things you don't know its doing whether you want it to or not. The secure element could turn into what Intel's management engine has become and be a possible backdoor into the device, without you knowing. I don't think that will happen but it is something to consider when looking at the security of storing your value. 
Edit: I didn't actually answer your question but yes I would consider iOS less secure because it isn't open source. Is open source the cure all for security? No, but it helps.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:29:28


IOS is pretty easy to secure when you restrict anything that hasn't been explicitly approved by Apple. And there have still been exploits for it just like Android. I didn't disregard anything. I didn't say the secure element is bad. You just asked why the trezor would be better than ledger and that is a reason people quote. Definitely a security trade off.

If this is the case, the coins won't be made available to you again until either the transaction is confirmed and added to the block chain, or the transaction doesn't confirm and you get the entire transaction back. Do you have a transaction id? If you give me that and how much you feel you are missing I should be able to verify my hypothesis. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:45:43
Your fee is a little low. Transactions that size have around .0007 in fees right now. As you can see from the link I have provided below, ~.15 was actually moved from your wallet but ~.05 is supposed to go back into your wallet/same address. You'll have to wait for the tx to be dropped from the mempool or for the transaction to be confirmed before you'll have access to the change. FYI change addresses usually send the leftovers to a different address in your wallet so you are not using change addresses. What wallet are you using? I would suggest getting a wallet that supports dynamic fees unless you wanted to send the tx with that fee. My favorite wallet is Electrum but there are a lot of wallets out there.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:00:38
If I'm not mistaken, the block explorer you were using has removed the transaction due to it taking too long. Until it is in a block on the chain the transaction didn't happen. Your Bitcoin never actually left you. Your wallet needs to refresh and see that the transaction is purged from the mempool. Then it will allow you to try and spend the Bitcoin again.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:29:13
I'm sorry, youre bcc on their chain i mean cause it would be anyone can spend from your transaction. Bcc chain won't enforce segwit rules but can accept the transactions.

Right but Litecoin is actively enforcing SegWit rules, BCC would not be. That is what they have said for a while now.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:45:39
So a replay attack is where a transaction meant for one chain gets processed on another chain as well, right? Bitcoin ABC has already stated that they will not accept SegWit transactions. But a SegWit transaction looks valid to non SegWit enforcing nodes. The only thing is that the transaction is considered anyone can spend. All Bitcoin ABC would need to do is take the SegWit transaction from the BTC chain and accept and process that on the BCC chain but not enforce the SegWit rules. That would put your BCC in an anyone can spend UTXO and then anyone could take it. What would stop that from happening after the fork if a person did not safely split their coins before broadcasting their SegWit transactions? Are there protections for this or am I just completely misunderstanding replay attacks or the backwards compatibility of SegWit transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:40:14
The introduction point does not know the actual IP address of the hidden service. I don't see that anywhere. The introduction point acts as a place where Alice can contact Bob to set up a secure connection.

Think of it like this, the chains will be exactly the same up until a specific block. You only have the one private key. Once the chain splits, your private key can access both coins on both chains since they are secured with the same key. I'm not sure how Bitcoin is going to handle it but when ETH forked, there were quite a few resources and services to help with separating your coins to keep things like this from happening. Once the fork happens, if it happens, just wait for a bit and look for information about separating your coins on the chains. You take the risk because when ETH did it, it dropped in price substantially but now ETH and ETC, the forked coin, are worth way more now than they were back at the fork.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:45:06
Are you using change addresses? If I'm not mistaken, sometimes a whole utxo will be transferred and what you aren't sending gets sent back into a change address. The transaction is unconfirmed so the btc hasn't been placed back into the change address but the utxo is still locked while the transaction is pending. I could be wrong here but I think that's right.

Well from what I can see, you didn't send the correct amount the first time even with the fee. They wanted .022 something and you sent .021 and then the fee was taken from that. The only thing I can think is make sure you double check your sending amount next time before you send it. Also make sure the fee isn't a part of the amount you want to send. It has to be extra. Maybe using a wallet like Electrum would be better but I can't really tell what happened here.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:55:13
If you're willing to post tx ids and the total amount of BTC Bitpay was asking for, I might be able to figure out what happened. Sounds like your wallet sent the correct amount but maybe subtracted the fee from what you were sending instead of using extra in your wallet to pay fee.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:57:12
This guy actually brings up a great point. SegWit specifically makes "healthy" (less processing for nodes and miners) transactions cheaper than "unhealthy" transactions. It tries to incentivize decreasing the UTXO set and specific transaction formats due to lower processing required. These transactions are almost the exact opposite of what tumblers try to do. They purposely take inputs and spread them out and mix them and and you get some back, and I believe some tumblers allow you to specify multiple receiving addresses and roughly how many inputs you want to come back to you. This is a huge market we are talking about and SegWit indirectly makes these transactions more expensive. Also I believe SegWit makes automatic tumblers easier to create in the future, due to it's malleability fix. That's a loss of current tumbler's WHOLE percent fees for every transaction they anonymize. And don't forget, they are most likely hitting every coin on the darkweb not only going into shady transactions but also when they are taken out of shady transactions. Double dipping. All of this could be gone. Someone should do some research as to how much they stand to possibly lose. But I doubt they would actively and publicly come out and oppose SegWit since that would create possible vectors for forming an association with their product. Just an idea here.
