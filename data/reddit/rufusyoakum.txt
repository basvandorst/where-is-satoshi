There are examples of it working in "real life" everyday but we're not really conditioned to think of it that way.
"If the government told you tomorrow that it was going to choose for you where to live, how to earn your keep, and who to marry – would you fall to your knees and thank the heavens that you have been saved from such terrible anarchy..."  
Taking the U.S. as an example.  How do 300 million individuals manage to choose their own job, where to live, and who to marry without some central authority being in control?  How could it be possible that they do all this by cooperating voluntarily?

Thanks.  I assumed to understand that you needed to know both the private and public key.  Knowing which pair of them goes together is what makes the technology secure.  Turns out the security is simply through hiding in vast numbers.  
That makes me a bit less keen on this tech.  You don't have to guess the private key that goes with a specific public key, you simply have to try a *bunch* of private keys until you find one that happens to have coins in it.

"...  but people are greedy."  Yet a government elected by the people is not greedy?  How is it that all these bad people manage to elect a benevolent government?  Please seriously consider these contradictions in your thoughts.  I have believed the same contradictions for years and it was unsettling.
You're asking me a bunch of questions about how roads will work without paying for them using extortion and threats of violence.  I honestly don't know.  I'm not a road engineer.  What I do know is that extortion is morally wrong.  
But even from my limited knowledge of road design, construction, maintenance, and overall economics; I have been to a number of business, malls, etc that have pretty extensive private roads and parking lots and there hasn't been anyone standing there demanding money from me to drive on them.  Business seem to be pretty incentiveized to assist their customers in getting access to their stores.  I've driven through many privately funded housing developments without paying any tolls.  
On the other hand imagine the money that was either extorted or borrowed against further generations to build the U.S. interstate highway system.  What would have happened with that money had it not been stolen?  What would people have spent that money on for themselves?  Maybe we wouldn't even need roads by now.  Maybe people would be more congregated and less spread out over the environment.  Maybe it would be common where there would be vast swaths of unsettled land simply because it was to expensive for suburbanites to pay for the roads themselves.  Maybe we'd have flying cars.  Maybe something neither one of us could possibly imagine.
Before you think flying cars is a wild ass idea.  Imagine the average slave owner in the early 1800's asking "who will pick the cotton?" if we were to abolish slavery.  We now know some 200+ years later the answer to that question.  Cotton will be picked by massive metal machines that cost more than the average home, run on dead dinosaur juice, and navigate by receiving invisible signals from some other machines orbiting the Earth.  The most intelligent cotton picking expert from 1800 couldn't have possibly known that would be the answer.  If someone were to even suggest it they would have been labeled insane and out of their mind yet they would have been 100% right.
So you can't possibly know how roads would work or even if there will be roads in 50 years from now if we stop extorting people to pay for them.  But what we do know is that extortion, theft, and threats of violence are morally wrong.

TIL - Voluntarily extending credit to those who want/need it is bad especially to poor people.
TIL - Drug cartels live outside government regulation because the $1 Trillion dollar government funded drug war has nothing to do with creating drug cartels in the first place.  Without government intervention people who would otherwise voluntarily exchange money for plants would arm themselves with MP5's and AR-15's because that's what happens at plant sales.
TIL - Employing people voluntarily creates a burden on "local services".  Voluntarily providing goods and services to people at a lower cost than competitors also creates a burden on "local services."  
TIL - Selling goods and services at low cost in a free market is easier to do when you must make enough profit to pay for the mortgage on your $10 million dollar house, your wife's $10,000 a week shopping habit, $2 million in car loans, $1 million dollar vacations, and your pet dog's pedicures, etc, etc, etc, etc.  But it's much harder to sell goods and services at low cost in a free market when you're working out of your 200 sq ft garage and eating raman noodles.
TIL - Solving problems with violence (government) is fairer and more equitable than solving problems peacefully and voluntarily (free market capitalism).

My lawn mowing company is going to provide you a service of mowing your lawn for you.  We're going arbitrarily charge you based on whatever we think is right.  We will also define what it means to get your lawn mowed.  That may or may not include actually mowing your lawn.  You have the option of accepting our service or leaving the country.  If you stay and don't pay we'll claim you now owe us more money.  If you don't pay that we'll try to put you in a cage with other criminals.  The cage is notoriously known for being a place where you WILL be ass raped for the duration of your stay.  If you resist being put in the rape cage we'll use whatever means necessary to subdue you which may or may not include your demise.  But that's your choice.  The good news is you get to vote.  There's 300 million of us and one of you.
In other words.  You know it's a service I actually want or need when I voluntarily agree to it.  Otherwise it's just extortion and theft back up with threats of overwhelming violence.

I have used purse in the past a half-dozen times over the past year as a bitcoin seller in the $50-$200 dollar per txn range.  All transactions went smooth.  However I did have some start-up type questions that went unanswered by their customer support for days.  When they were answered the answers seemed brief, vague and sometimes unrelated to my question.  And I still don't like that my name and shipping address are exposed to the bitcoin buyer.  All this didn't give me any warm fuzzies.  But then I started hearing about these issues others have been having and so I have been shying away from purse lately.

This is incorrect.  You cannot create more satoshis by subdividing them any more than you can create more pennies by dividing a penny in half.  You simply create a smaller unit of measure.  
Think of a penny as 0.01.   If I subdivide that penny in two I get 0.005 and 0.005.  The total still equals 0.01.  I may have created a new unit of measure e.g. a half-penny.  A half-penny doe not equal a penny any more than a half-satoshi equals a satoshi.  No inflation.  No doubled money.

It should be noted that segwit does not increase the base block size at all.  Base block size is what the entire bitcoin ecosystem understands today.

I understand comparing Bitcoin to say the total market value of gold.  Where in both cases people are using it as a store of value.  
I don't understand comparing it to the total remittances per year or total revenues of the black market, or payments made with Visa/MC, etc.  People using bitcoins for remittances or payments just need to borrow them for a bit so to speak.  Ideally they would buy and sell at the same price or very close.  Obviously on a wide adopted scale this would increase demand on a finite supply hence the price would rise.  But I can't see the price rising equal to the total remittance amount.  If so you could become wealthy just by sending money back and forth.

@_date: 2017-06-22 15:51:48
You should use the term backwards-compatible carefully here.  
In the current bitcoin network, pre-segwit release, a segwit formatted transaction is an anyone-can-spend transaction.  A miner could pay the output of that transaction to himself  (take the bitcoins) if he were to mine that block.   
After segwit code is released and segwit nodes start enforcing new segwit rules they would reject that same block as being invalid which would fork the network.  By definition if a fork can occur then the change is not  backwards-compatible.
In summary, A soft-fork doesn't insure new rules won't cause a network fork.

The biggest threat to me and my family is government.  They say I owe them money.  The amount changes based on their whims but it amounts to tens of thousands of dollars every year.  I never agreed to any of it.  I never consented to any of it.  But if I don't give them money they will eventually send heavily armed men to my house to kick down my door, shoot my dog, and throw me in a cage.   It's well known, and a commonly joked about among the entire population, that I would be anally raped in this cage for the duration of my stay.  If I refuse to be thrown in a rape cage and try to defend my self from these thugs they will murder me and justify it by saying they're just doing their jobs.  They don't keep me safe in my bed at night.  These are not people that care about my safety at all.

Did Nick provide any evidence of his claims?

Wait wut!  I thought bitcoin couldn't support reversals!

Sorry.  I'm a sucker for a good idea.  You can't take it with you.

All this good news from SE Asia.  So much potential here.
Too bad the reference client owners of the most important technological innovation of our time decided that increasing the capacity of the protocol from 1mb of transaction data per 10 minutes is too risky.

FYI, here's what he wrote in 2010:
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."

ASICBoost, from what I understand, is a mining optimization.  An increase in efficiency.  Would you describe it differently?  If not then what leads you to believe that increases in mining efficiency would have been an "unforeseen, unintended outcome" to Satoshi?
What leads you to believe that transaction malleability is a "vulnerability" of Bitcoin?  Do you believe transaction malleability is a serious issue?  Has anyone lost bitcoin due to transaction malleability?  Do you believe transaction malleability is a bigger issue than exponentially increasing fees and transaction backlogs?
If I wanted to know what Satoshi's vision was I would look to what he wrote.  For example here's what he wrote about the blocksize in 2010.
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete."

Here's how we did it in the old days
-minrelaytxfee=&lt;amt&gt; Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying, mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001) *

Here's what I gather.
Your post is titled "Satosi's Vision"  Then you go on to interpret Satoshi's vision using no evidence from what Satoshi actually wrote.  When I provide actual evidence of his vision based on what he actually wrote you say it's irrelevant.
You say acicboost, a mining optimization, was an unforeseen vulnerability.  I ask why you think mining optimizations would have been unforeseen you provide no evidence.  
You say transaction malleability is a "vulnerability" which hinders side chains and scaling.  I point you to an actual existing side chain that isn't being hindered by transaction malleability.  You then just repeat that it's still a road block, seemingly contrary to reality, but provide no proof or evidence of your claim.
You then, I suppose in frustration, accuse me of pushing an agenda.  I'm just following proof and evidence.
