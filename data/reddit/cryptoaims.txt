You don't know exact date because Bitcoin block varies from 9.3 up to 9.9 minutes. Most of them use 10 as a reference  and that's why the results are in the second half of May but most likely using real data it will be in the first half of May 2020.

It doesn't have to be a payment method to be a profitable for its holders. 
Look at Gold for example!
There is a reason why Bitcoin is called a "Digital Gold".
