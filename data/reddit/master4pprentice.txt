I'm not saying it makes sense, though gathering all the gold seems more impractical than gathering bitcoin. As I said, this would be an extremist thinking, someone who would want to destroy this.

No, my current electrum wallet balance is the same as the sent amount (0.21419 mbtc), I don't understand all the other numbers

Is this a known fact? Or is it common for exchange sites to do this? I mean, what is the "true" market price of BC then anyway?
So the situation is the same even for larger amounts?
Otherwise what you said makes sense to me, yes. Thanks a lot!

Either way, I'm not putting one above the other. I'm considering buying one but I don't know which one.

Screw you man. Can't start my day with this negative BS!

Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
Otherwise I get the sums thanks to your explanations, however I dont get this part:


What do you mean by the GDAX price being higher? My naive understanding would be that GDAX pays the transaction fees for me, since the amount of BTC didn't change?

1. Insert ledger to USB
2. Get address of ledger
3. Send Bitcoin Cash to said address
4. Throw ledger in the trash
5. Buy new ledger
6. Put on Bitcoin and store securely
JK man, I'm just playing around. Why Ledger and not trezor tho?
Cheers
