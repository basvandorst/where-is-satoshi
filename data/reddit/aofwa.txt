You’re explaining how the network is secured, not backed. 
When Bitcoin tanks, it becomes worthless - unexchangeable

But why lend money if you make greater returns from holding? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:42:58
So for the borrower, not only do they have a high interest rate, their earnings are dropping. That becomes a very expensive loan. That doesn't work.

Would it be possible to create a crypto currency that inflates/deflates in proportion to the supply of goods/services? 
What if we just hookup some AI to a blockchain? What would it take to create a decentralized Fed?

Well, my definition of "working" is one that enables economic prosperity for as many people as possible. 
Our current system also allows for us to reverse an economic crisis from becoming a great depression. 
I don't see a deflationary currency like Bitcoin making that possible just yet. Perhaps it may become more stable than the dollar - I'm not sure why it would though. I have seen theories that Bitcoin's price is simply following the S-Curve adoption graph, in which case it might stabilize once/if it takes world domination.

If that’s the case then isn’t BTC “controlled” by a handful of large holders? 
Everyone here is throwing a fit because Roger Ver is “manipulating” the market.

What is good about deflation? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:28:08
Forking is not a weakness. Blockchain is here to stay until the end of civilization - or until a better technology is created. 
If a better chain is created and forked from a a current branch and gains adoption, that is a strength, not a weakness. 
Remember - it *just so happens* that the core devs have a better technology proposal. What if roger ver was proposing a lightening network and a better scaling solution. We would be glad that forking was possible. 
Forking creates a survival of the fittest, evolutionary model of progression.

A hard fork is more like accepting silver along side gold. Which would have the same effect as printing money - inflation.

@_date: 2017-11-15 04:50:27
But there’s no point in saving money other than enough for security. 
And deflation does not encourage lending and borrowing. 
I would argue that debt is a good thing, it makes society productive and creates a stable and growing economy that allows us to enjoy the benefits of modern society.

I know how bitcoin works, I don't think that answers my question though. If the U.S bans exchanges, then you would have to convert from from Bitcoin -&gt; Other Currency -&gt; U.S Dollar in order to price a good or service, right?

They're also racist, deplorable and white supremacists, so I will call them that too. I don't see a problem with it. They would even agree with me that that is what they are.

Honest question. What would happen to Bitcoin if exchanges were made illegal? How would one determine the market value?
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:14:08
Because taxation does not take from people what they already own. By participating in society you agree to the set of laws that dictate what is owed. 
Basically, we all just hit agree without actually reading the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Well I’m focusing on Bitcoin in its current state, you’re talking about blockchain 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:31:36
I know how Bitcoin works... 
Our system undoubtably has flaws, but there is no denying that it works. Whether or not it works *well* is really open to interpretation.  
I am not against Bitcoin. I want it to succeed, but I also understand how basic economics work, and I don’t see Bitcoin being able to produce an economy better than our current system. 
I have the choice to do a lot of things, and as it currently stands it would be pretty dumb to ditch Dollars and only transact with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:14:36
And this gets back to my original point - that the specifics of any protocol may change... one chain may adopt higher currency limits... an unlimited amount, etc... Bitcoin is not as infallible as many on here make it seem. 
I think that’s a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:15:17
Cuz they are creating new tech... or scamming. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:45:14
Not impossible, but yeah, very difficult. It’s pretty hard to say what would happen if large groups of people wanted to split off and accept a forked currency alongside then main branch - dealing with two currencies, which wouldn’t require majority vote and is pretty similar to the populist party of 1890s wanting to accept silver. 


Ask that to the populist party of the late 19th century. It’s pretty simple to understand why someone would want this - if I owe $100 and can’t pay it off, increasing the money supply helps pay that debt. 
And I say this independent of the fact of whether or not *in reality* these changes are good or bad economics. The point I am getting at is that groups of people have the power to make these changes without knowing the economic implications of their actions.

There's nothing inherently wrong with a currency being controlled or manipulated. 
Just saying. Our current system is the best system we've got, it being centralized is of course the problem as it is vulnerable to corruption. 
An inflationary currency seems necessary to create a productive society. There is no indication that Bitcoin will stabilize, and until now it is deflationary. So here's the issue with that - prices of goods and services dropping in value in relation to Bitcoin value also mean your wages will drop in relation to bitcoin value. That's fine until you think about how that effects lenders.
If a lender is advertising a 1% interest rate on a loan, that seems really good - but if the price of goods and services are *falling*, when adjusted for deflation that interest rate is much higher and not good at all, compounded with your wages decreasing this is bad. This causes borrowing to decrease (and no one will offer 0% interest rates or negative interest rates because they don't make sense) - businesses to slow - hoarding of money to increase (aka hodling) - and the economy to slow and become less productive as whole. A deflationary cycle and a depression. 
Bitcoin doesn't offer any solutions for this yet. Perhaps it can be used as a store of value, but until it stabilizes (and there is no indication that it ever will) it will not be a useful means of exchanging for goods and services - and especially not for lending and borrowing. In the mean time, something else will have to be used - the dollar, because it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:15:05
It’s true that no one person can, but what happens when large groups of people want to increase the money supply. 
People here either forget or just don’t know... it wasn’t the bankers that originally wanted to increase the money supply *it was the people*, the farmers, the *borrowers*, the *debtors*.
One person can write the code to change that And all takes is a hard fork and a large group to accept the new currency for that to happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:03:55
It’s only a takeover when it starts competing in terms of transactions for goods and services
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:27:31
Gotcha. Okay that makes sense, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:05:53
You’re joking right? 
Why would some make a loan when holding it would make them more money. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:36:35
I’m not following. Deflation means the value increases. It would be worth more than $100 after the year 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:29:20
I’m not an expert, but .. For example, a loan of 100 BTC with let’s say a low interest of 2%.
Over time 100 BTC becomes more and more valuable. Mean while, your employer needs pay you less and less BTC because the value of your work is not increasing at the same rate. Your loan is now increasingly harder and harder to pay off, even though it was a very low interest rate.
There is very little incentive to make this loan in the first place, because it has a smaller return over a greater amount of time. 
In this scenario, loaning is not incentivised, and instead, hoarding money is, because it is a greater return on investment and less risky. When people hoard money the economy slows down which leads to recessions and depressions.

@_date: 2018-04-06 22:13:51
Well, explain Ethereum then 
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:11:46
How so?
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:56:53
I think you’re making a classic mistake. 
There’s no point in making a loan worth $100 and expecting $95 value back if a year from now that $100 value will have a real value of $105. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:55:02
You definitely can do that with Ethereum, doesn’t matter what the intentions are. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:34:36
Same could be said about Bitcoin, minus the cryptokitties. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:16:56
Isn't the only reason bitcoin is "naturally deflationary" is that over time wallets/bitcoins will be lost forever, causing existing bitcoin value to rise. 
Which will not b affecting the currency until well after 2100?? Or am I way off the mark?
