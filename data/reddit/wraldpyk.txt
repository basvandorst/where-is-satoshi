You can always check  to check what technology the website was build on.

4 transactions only?
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:03:52
just be sure you don't put everything you have on Bitcoin (its not safe yet to do that)

Why would you provide false info in your account. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:20:41
right. I already opted in with my shop, but since the platform I'm on uses the API, and not their service directly I still can't use it. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:01:39
Still the best bot out there.

`Ƀ` is not the Bitcoin symbol, neither should it be. `฿` is much closer, but at this point there is no unicode symbol for Bitcoin

no point in blocking wallets. Anyone can create hundreds of wallets easily

Honest question, why is it so bad, and what can happen?
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:21:14
it does indeed with RES. But not if you just go to the page itself, it was damn quick for me
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:31:03
people still compare EUR with USD. I'm not sure if it'll ever happen
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:46:55
can we list any site which should not accept it
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:17:39
you can easily buy ingredients for that price. Guess at some supermarkets you could buy one too for that price. Or IKEA. At least in Netherlands ;)

RataPlan in the center of Haarlem
@_date: 2014-01-03 12:53:47
awesome. Didn't see that
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:09:14
Also, always hover over the URL to see if the visible URL is the actual one linked
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:36:57
There are countries missing from the list, like the Netherlands, Belgium, France. 
There are more than 11 countries, this is just an error

Bitcoin hasn't been around long enough to make any conclusions about this. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:08:28
No. Someone bought them off you. Not coinbase

Well. Of course everyone has high expections. You will fail if you don't. But if the whole world expect you to be awesome and game changing, you bet people are going to be disapointed
