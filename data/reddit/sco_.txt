According to that logic, couldn't the hacker just watch your every move and get your Coinbase login?

So assuming something like a 5% margin, you're moving 20k (in cash) a month and this isn't causing any trouble with your bank?

Not hating, just reporting the facts.... I'm glad to hear some people got a working product but this process has had a plethora of problems from start to, well its not even finished yet.

Yes, just make sure it is the same voltage and current so you don't fry the miner.

They mailed me a replacement but it took a few weeks. I would suggest finding your own with matching current and voltage.

I'm not exactly sure whats wrong. It won't boot up and the indicator light in the front won't turn on. There is a slow flashing redlight toward where the power plugs in and the fans switch (maybe 1/12 of a rotation) every second or so. How easy was it for you to open yours up? I didn't see any easy access. How did you open it?

Seriously, it's a major bummer. I've already given up on being able to make back my investment. I'm going to fly over to Kansas and give them a beatdown in 2 weeks.

If they were wise, they would have already transferred the balance to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-26 23:23:48
Bummer, have you returned it yet?

Did they cover the costs to ship it back to their office and the cost of the replacement shipping?
