I didn't say it was good for stability - you and I both know that. However, Fiat has been shown to be preferable in the current market. And unfortunately, there are no other large scale alternatives. Cryptos might come in to do that with certainty, but we can barely keep fees down. Not to mention Satoshis white paper covers other things that the current iteration of BTC doesn't even do yet. 
PS. On the Fiat issue, look at Lincolns Greenbacks. You don't have to go that far back.

He's literally using history to explain why Fiat currencies bursting isn't as bad. They usually bounce back and currently preferable to crypto because there's no global scalability with it.

Yeah but a number of merchants are dropping BTC because the fees are exorbitantly high. MS did this, among others. Until the lightning network shows it can be scaled and linear adoption rates follow, there will be a random walk about this 10-15k range. 
There might be the occasional pump and dump tho so it's better to hold if you already cashed some out. It'll likely find a new equilibrium somewhere in the middle of it's high, and it's low.

Haha no chance. You might see that around mid 2018. Maybe at the end of 2018 but BTC needs good news to shoot back up.

Cause it's chump change. Think about how much money they'll make on that interest rate if you actually pay it back. Probably a couple hundred dollars compared to the thousands they'll make on lending you a larger amount

Look philosophically, I'm market anarchist, so don't bother lecturing me on your LVL 1 view of government and politics. 
As it stands, the government using Fiat is a trust fund that the money you use is worth it - they have to give a shit to balance the odds, otherwise, they lose out on their assets. Unless America loses the next world war, and the dollar goes to shit, this can go on to infinity (which, if you studied your history you'd know that the US came out on top after letting Nations duke it out, while we sat on the sidelines).

Because of positive speculation. With regulations and government oversight and taxes on the horizon, there seems to be a lot of FUD. Rightfully, so. Fees are killing right now. I figure the real ppl holding right now are the ones sticking with the vision. 
Like I said, unless positive news comes out in the next coming months expect it to stay around 10-15k. Maybe the lightning network will change that but who knows

Probably not his forté. Research is very focused up to that level. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:56:19
There's no fee fallacy. The transaction costs are so large merchants like Microsoft are bailing. I mean for Christ's sake, the Bitcoin con in Miami had to stop accepting it as payment because of the costs so don't try that shit. 
The market isn't providing winning alternatives to the dollar just yet. And I just said cryptos could do just that, even tho their potential is very high. I believe in crypto as the future but it's not living to it's potential. A bunch of gambling types have infiltrated the space and caused large amounts of speculation. Which could be detrimental to the brand image of BTC

The volatility in 2018 was insane. Much higher than 10%. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:13:27
In the long run, yes. But if you're looking to make money, you could lose money. The prices are adjusting to what the market/people decide what bitcoins true value is. Obviously the tech is what people pay for in terms of intrinsic value but no one sees that. Most here are trying to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:49:20
For Bitcoin to reach critical mass, the price needs to come down. The fact that people were using it as a get rich quick scheme made it into a bubble. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:40:27
Every state still probably launch it's own cryptocurrency that makes it 1:1 with real dollars. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 14:50:47
If you want to lose money. Probably someone who has money in crypto already

Predicting markets is like predicting the weather. Tomorrow you can have some degree of accuracy, but a week out, you may as well take a guess. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:36:41
You're just showing how risky of an asset it is. It's not a stable currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:59:46
No, they weren't willing to pay transaction fees doofus. They backed out cause lightning is taking too long to scale at a reasonable time. If lightning had come out before the years end, no crash.

Or how about the show?
Some of you didn't grow up with the Simpsons and it shows 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:46:45
Already cashed out. You're better off betting on an altcoin since BTC is too speculative. I don't want to deal with all that uncertainty. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:17:38
No it's bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:40:54
Everyone who's serious about crypto and not in it for speculation know this is an issue smh
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:55:13
I'm going to @ all three of them just to make fun of this stupid graph

Depending on the country, don't forget to report it on your taxes. Otherwise, you'll be thrown into a cage.
