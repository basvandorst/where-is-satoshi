In some ways.
In some ways.

I absolutely detest ALL CAPS. 
Stop. What you are saying is not that important I promise you.

Bitch I'm buying
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:34:48
I mean the idea is we are all buying. DCA. Strength in numbers. This is just a poor mans interpretation of bitcoin.

I mean in their defense I don't really find these aging posts that funny either. I think it's just played out since the vitalik and CZ ones? I dunno I mean csw is scum of the earth imo. 
I prefer to ignore ppl like csw instead of giving them any attention, even negative. Negative attention is still attention which is what ppl like csw want., they are that desperate.

This is definitely true! What separates BTC from a cryptokitty in that case?

You are making posts on reddit. Someone has to tell you you're a dumbass OP. I let everyone else do that for me.

Same! It's like a mind-virus. I look at it like Agent Smith from I think the 2nd or 3rd Matrix when he infects that human and gets into the "real world". 
Bitcoin is a digital creation impacting physical meatspace! It's crazy!

Short sellers? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:54:31
They are not creating money. They are printing fiat and devaluing it in the process. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:53:39
Literally nope.
