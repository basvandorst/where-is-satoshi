Think of a person's name (Alice) as their public key, and think of their signature (*Alice*) as their private key.
Let's say that the network agrees that Alice has 1 coin. Anyone can look up the balance of the public key "Alice".
When Alice wants to give her coin to Bob, she sends out this message:


So Alice used her private key to sign a message saying her coin now belongs to the "Bob" public key.
This message gets propagated through the network, and now the network agrees that Bob has 1 coin and Alice has none.
If Bob wants to return the coin, he has to prove that he is Bob by using his private key:


You don't need to prove who you are to accept coins, only to spend the ones that were sent to you.
It does get a bit more complicated than this, but if you understand this you are well on your way, hope this helps!

I would argue that Bitcoin has true scarcity while fiat that can be printed by a central bank has artificial scarcity. There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, and their rate of generation is public, consistent, and predictable, (with small variations due to how quickly computer power is being added.) Just like the chips the teacher handed out, there are only a finite number of them, so it seems illogical to us for the teacher to expect more chips back than there are in existence. We say fiat is artifically scarce because its actual scarcity can be manipulated at the whim of a third party that you may or may not trust.

Maybe think of it this way: every miner that solves the hash for a block of transactions gets all the transaction fees from those transactions. Makes sense, right? They spent the CPU power necessary to make those transactions permanent, so the fees go to them.
Think of the block reward as like a "limited-time transaction fee bonus", where in addition to the fees, the miner also gets 25 new bitcoins. This incentivizes miners to build the bitcoin network and is a clever way to distribute new coins in a predictable and controlled manner.

I think with campbx you have:
1. bank -&gt; dwolla: 3-4 days, no fee

1. campbx usd -&gt; campbx btc: instant, 0.55% trade commission to campbx
1. campbx btc -&gt; bitcoin: instant, some bitcoin fee (have to wait 31 days before first dwolla deposit to do this)
Total: 3-4 business days with $0.25 + 0.55% in fees
And with Coinbase:
1. bank -&gt; coinbase btc: several business days (sometimes a week), $0.15 + 1% fees
1. coinbase btc -&gt; bitcoin: instant, mandatory 0.0005 btc fee
Total: several business days with $0.15 + 1% in fees
Neither give you real privacy. You have to verify your bank account with Dwolla or Coinbase.

The answer is client-side encryption.
With Blockchain, they can't actually see your keys (or even your addresses), they just have an encrypted blob of data that can only be decrypted with your password. The only thing that goes to and from their server is entirely encrypted.
And you don't have to just take them for their word, they have published the source code of the browser extension. You can verify that your encryption key (password) never gets sent to the server, even upon creation, and is only used to decrypt the blob of data from the server. And with code signing, you can verify that the version you installed is the one you're looking at the source code of.
This sums it up:

I twitch a little when I read that stuff too.
What I tell people is that the coins are virtual. There is no string of 0's and 1's that is the coin, that gets transferred from person to person.
What IS real are addresses and keys which have balances. That is exactly what is stored on your hard drive.

You must remember that every time you receive bitcoins at a new address, and that new address becomes a part of your wallet, you will need to make a NEW paper backup. Your paper backup gives you ability to send coins from all your CURRENT addresses, but if you get more addresses, your paper backup won't let you access those.
This means you must be careful about change. In some clients (but not all), when you spend fewer coins than are in one address, the remainder doesn't just remain in that old address, it gets sent to a brand new "change address", that you are given the keys to. This new change address is what will not be included in your paper wallet.
I say not all clients do this because I have noticed that the Blockchain "My Wallet" client will actually return change to the original address. I think this because I've seen it on one of my transactions: 
If someone could verify that that is in fact what Blockchain is doing, I'd appreciate it. (That is, change is returned to the original address instead of being put into a new address.)
EDIT: Regarding "maintenance":
You want your paper wallet to be the only way to spend your coins, but you still want to be able to check the balance of the paper wallet without having to pull it out of its secret place, right? In that case, you can use any online wallet (or a wallet desktop app), and add the paper wallet's addresses as "WATCH-ONLY". Basically that means you're giving the public addresses on the paper backup to the online wallet, but the secret keys to spend the coins in those addresses remains on the piece of paper. (You never want to let that part touch the internet.) Then in the online wallet you can view the balance of those addresses, but you can't spend the coins at those addresses, since that requires the paper backup. I hope this helps!

Yes, but most people should not concern themselves with mining, since doing so is becoming increasingly infeasible economically. Every ten minutes a single miner gets 25 coins. As more people try to mine, the chance that you will "win that race" in any given ten minute period goes down significantly. Here's an example payout schedule of a certain piece of hardware:  You can see that the monthly profit starts to go negative.


Correct. What the creator dictated is that in the beginning, the reward for mining would be 50 coins every 10 minutes, with that amount halving every four years. Doing the math, the final fraction of a coin will be mined in 2140, and there will be about 21 million in total.


The price is determined by a free market. Just supply and demand :) While there are multiple exchanges to buy/sell from, their prices should always move towards equilibrium because there will always be people who take advantage of any difference by buying cheaply at one place and selling high at another place.


Like I said earlier, the code dictates that X coins are mined every ten minutes. (Currently, X = 25.) The network is designed to adjust itself so that if miners start minting coins faster than that rate, mining becomes more difficult and the minting rate goes back to every ten minutes. If mining becomes too difficult, the network adjusts to make it easier. It's designed so that the minting rate stays on schedule :)

I've had a no-fee transaction that took about 24 hours on Blockchain. I also had a no-fee transaction take an hour or so. Not sure what affects it.
If you look at your "Transactions" page (and you have to set view to "compact"), then when you click on a transaction it will bring up a modal, and that modal will have something like "Network Propagation: 95% (Very Good)". I wonder why that percentage is not on a single transaction page. I don't think the Google Map of network propagation is helpful at all.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:16:45
There is an API call to get "unspent outputs" given an address. So say you're given a "from" address and a "to" address and you want to create a raw transaction. You look up unspent outputs on the from address, those become inputs in the new transaction. You construct the outputs yourself using the "to" address and the amount to transfer (don't forget change).
You can get unspent outputs from the Blockchain API. It's also part of the JSON RPC API for bitcoind, the reference client.

I've considered this. Using Blockchain to monitor my Armory wallet.

I dislike these descriptions of Bitcoin that explain mining first. The analogy of mining for gold implies that there are two separate systems: one for creating coins, and one for trading coins. People need to realize that coins aren't mined simply from doing a CPU-intensive task, they're mined by **committing transactions to the public ledger**, that is, by participating in the network that makes trading possible. In fact, the entire system will work without the block reward. I like to think of the block reward as something that's not essential for the Bitcoin system, but is a pragmatic "add-on" to create coins that don't currently exist, and to incentivize people to participate in the network.

This is an awesome idea! I've been playing with the Kraken beta for a week now and I LOVE it. Cannot wait for it to go live.
So you'll definitely be offering US bank transfers? If you could find any way to speed up the process that would be amazing. I'm stuck waiting the painful 3-4+ business days with Coinbase or Dwolla. I'm starting to think that's the absolute minimum time it takes for an irreversible bank transaction to complete. If only there was a faster method of sending money... :)
I would still prefer Kraken over Dwolla/CampBX because of one less step. The fees are better than Coinbase, and Coinbase doesn't have any of these awesome trading features.

Maybe you could touch on digital signatures? I like your treating of a transaction as the message "Gareth gives 1 coin to Bob". You could go further with this by saying that this message also needs to be signed by Gareth before any of the members of the network accept it.
Security with Bitcoin all comes down to who is able to sign away your coins. You want to make sure you're the only one.

They're just making it easier for themselves and others to speculate on it, inviting others to "invest in Bitcoin". You can invest in Bitcoin by investing in the infrastructure: by supporting companies that are building useful tools around it and are making it more palatable to the public. Putting money in a fund and not actually getting any bitcoin you can spend encourages hoarding, when the point right now should be making bitcoin more and more useful to spend.

Bitcoin.org suggests MultiBit as a desktop client, mainly because it doesn't require downloading the blockchain. As far as attracting new users to the software, the "lite" clients like MultiBit make it easy to start working with bitcoin today rather than tomorrow.
Lite clients are fairly young still, but I think it's worth it to learn about them because I think they will most likely be the software that normal people run day to day.

The nodes in the network broadcast transactions once they hear about them. So when the first transaction occurs, it quickly gets propagated through the network, and a large percentage of miners have incorporated it into their own personal transaction pools. Then if a miner hears another (valid) transaction that tries to spend the same coins as the first transaction, it ignores the second. So yes, precedence is the deciding factor. We can be secure that the miners will behave this way as long as a majority of the network is honest.
So I wouldn't say the system is reliant on timestamps.
New transactions are like this noisy cloud of activity, and the miners job is to turn it into a strict chronological ordering so that the numbers always add up. Honest miners will always remember the first transaction they hear and ignore any further ones trying to spend the same funds. As long as the attacker doesn't control a majority of miners, he can't double spend.
