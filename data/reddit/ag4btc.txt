This is an unfortunate incident for you. For me though, over my 30 purchases so far I've also only had one experience like this that was totally worth it though given my ~25% savings level.
A useful tip is to put a nickname on your Amazon Wishlists so that the Shipping Name doesn't show up for the earner. Using this, the only info I end up divulging is my city and state.
My one incident was:




_Edit: wow, downvoted to negative points for a provable savings post. The anti-Purse/carder delusion is strong in this thread._

Lol, Purse's word, not mine

Even if Amazon starts accepting bitcoin, there will still be those persons looking to liquidate their Amazon credit. 
What would actually kill Purse is if Amazon went ahead and made their Amazon Credit tradeable &amp; if they started paying Mechanical Turk workers with something more liquid like Bitcoin instead of credits. _I don't see either of these happening soon._

Not buying this. I've had nothing but good experiences with their support team and they've done some legitimately good things for the ecosystem to date (see latest [bcoin hackathon]( they held). I know two of the mods listed on their sub are also very active on Twitter: &amp; **Proof or gtfo.**

I've also used them with .uk &amp; .in successfully.

And people on here ask why Earners on Purse.io would ever pay a moderate premium for bitcoin... the world's a lot bigger than the USofA.

Market's getting tight. My 21% orders aren't even clearing in 4 - 6 days and I often find myself coming down to the 16% - 19% range. Mind you, I used to be able to do average 30% - 35% just a few weeks ago with a drop to 26% - 28% if orders sat for more than 4 - 6 days (this was about 4 weeks ago, market changed about 2 weeks ago).
Got any recent stats on the system Y'all have published really useful things in the past.
