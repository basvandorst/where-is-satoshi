But realistically speaking, is this something that will look to resolve all of these issues?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:17:13
Yes, because the website lists USD but not eur or gbp..
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:22:05
Growth, I hope.

Be generous and change my life, please. I'll work for you!

All I can keep hearing is that this exchange is a joke. Please stop using them.

I have just cashed out my investment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:51
Bro, it's going up and up everyday. Any dip is marginal. Just buy and holddddddddd.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:22:21
I'd also like to know this.

This is a valid point. So much exposure recently but it lacks scalability. Fees are at an all time high, yet BTC continues to pump due to the newcomers. How can this type of currency be utilized with it's current fees. It can only hande 7tx.

None of which specify if GBP is insured...
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:42:22
I couldn't agree more and this is why I sold my investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:26:34
Yes, it is a shame.
I have some bad news though. Only USD is insured. I have also done some more digging on Coinbase's website and they advise that 98% of all digital assets are stored offline and they only insure what is online 2%.. So it's best to take your money off.

All I'm seeing recently is that BTC has incredibly high fees. Are people not worried about this? I understand LN is being developed but realistically speaking, will this resolve all of the issues? So much money is being pumped into BTC right now but once people are aware of such implications, why would they continue to invest? More importantly, how can the currency be used in it's current state.

Not sure if this will work for you but I use Revolut. I transfer GBP to the account, convert it to euro, and then send to Coinbase. 
Turn around is about 3 hours?

11.4kusd to 10.4 but climbing again
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:55
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:34:11
it was 11.4 like an hour ago but it's dropped to 10.5
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:10
coin base issues, perhaps? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:24:07
Only invest what you're willing to lose. In your circumstance, I would say keep your money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:47
gdax was going insane with sell orders. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:46
Whilst writing this, you missed a dip from 11.4 to 10.5. If you setup gdax, you can configure timed buys for a value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:30:40
This will happen sooner than you think.
