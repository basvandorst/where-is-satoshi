* Some people were faking Segwit adoption by sending Segwit transactions.

With this solution you need 104 spaces to store each words. 4 columns of 26 letters. 
You can go from 104 spaces to 11 spaces for each words. Each words is a number from 0 to 2047. You need 11 bits to store any words in the bip39 dictionary. You just need to punch the number in binary. A 1 is a hole a 0 is no hole.
