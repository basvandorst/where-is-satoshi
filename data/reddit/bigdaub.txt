A straight forward monthly fee. The the real benefit is for the business owner. This easily fits into how payments are handled already. There is very little training needed for employees. Settings can't be changed without a authorized card, there are no private keys or funds actually stored on the terminal. Another side note is the perception of customers. People are used to seeing credit card terminals. This gives some legitimacy to bitcoin payments.

Yes and you can also pay with litecoin. After you input your pin you pick which account to pay out of. The terminal can also be used to sell bitcoin if the option is enabled.

A literal creep ;) That's how our sizes are listed. Then if someone asks how much bigger is the 16oz from the 12oz you can say around 4oz....

You can it just needs a security step for the merchant. The merchant sets up "manager" access through a another Coinkite card. If a refund is needed someone with the extra credentials has to swipe their card in the terminal. No other mobile wallet has theses types of controls setup for retailers. A merchant can deactivate "manager" access through the back end or give specific authorization.

If a customer wants to pay through another wallet the terminal prints a qr code with the address and amount embedded.
