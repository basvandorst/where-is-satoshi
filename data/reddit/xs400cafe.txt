No way to withdraw or send and you likely aren't even holding any bitcoin, just betting on the price. As they say, not your keys, not your coin. Plus, if people weren't buying on robinhood, they would actually effect the market price since they would be trading real coins, feels like a lot of potential volume wasted.

Simply send me 10 bitcoins and I'll send back 100!

Of course you can send and receive!

bitcoin is only a decade +11 months old... not sure who was saying this about bitcoin before it existed
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:32:25
How is this not blowing up this sub right now? 2 BILLION dollars worth of stolen bitcoin being liquidated on binance, they know which wallets its coming from, and binance wont block those transactions? this is huge
@_date: 2019-08-11 21:13:39
Yes it is. If you keep your seed written down elsewhere for backup and use an airgapped computer you can sign a transaction offline, save it, and export it to your phone or online computer, on which you have your watch only wallet, and upload to the block chain easily. Your private keys will never have to leave the encrypted USB and will never be exposed to a network.

He likely would have understood what that would do to the market. Since he was that early he could have multiple smaller wallets to obscure identity.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:25:17
he called the bottom too, so hes already 3 for 3

They actually just changed the fee setup. They charge a fee now and sell at market price directly.

Funds are safu
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:34:37
download any reputable bitcoin wallet. Electrum is popular and well supported.  
  
To be safe, download it on your PC and turn airplane mode on before you generate a new wallet.  
write down your seed when the wallet is generated  
generate your new wallet and copy the receiving address  
delete your wallet  
turn off airplane mode  
use that address in coinbase to send your funds to  
boom. done.  
  
I suggest reading up on it a bit more, you can copy your public key and make a watch only wallet on your phone or something so you can continue to send funds to it but cant withdraw, check your balance for piece of mind ect. There are safer ways to generate a wallet as well, like doing all of this on a live usb OS thats never gonna see the internet ect.

binance can track the known illicit coins as the transfer wallets and freeze the binance wallets they are sent to. aka once they get to binance from a flagged wallet "not your keys, not your coins"
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:05:59
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:46:25
Fees are way higher than coinbase pro though
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:48:43
It would be easy to run a chain analysis and freeze those illicit coins. Do you have any more info on this? I wonder how much they have left to dump.
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:12:34
Its 200k BTC  aka 2 billion USD. look it up, its a pretty obvious exit scam. PlusToken founders disappeared with the funds, later arrested.  The bitcoin has been moved from multisig wallets and is being broken up into 100 btc chunks and sold on binance and a few other exchanges...
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:43:02
but you don't actually own your bitcoin on robinhood, so if you ever want to use bitcoin i would stay away
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:50:09
my withdrawals are instant from coinbase pro as well
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:25:11
If you've been around bitcoin long enough, you'll understand why people say "not your keys, not your coins". If you're using it as a store of value, its even more important to be able to physically own them. Many, many, other platforms similar to robinhood, if not most, have ended with people not being able to access their coins and losing everything. So if youre thinking long term, the bitcoin protocol wont be going anywhere but these companies may disappear or lock your funds.

If market price is %10000, they will sell it to you for ~$10150, or buy it from you for ~$9850. That's the spread, aka fee or premium you're buying at. Coinbase is also high, but coinbase pro (gdax) is significantly cheaper as you can do limit buys.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:26:25
liquidating 2 billion dollars is probably why the price is dropping.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:36:37
Ahh shit, you're a good troll ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:00:39
I believe it's 1.3-1.5%

If you're using Robinhood, you don't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:42:45
Robinhood doesn't even back that with actual Bitcoin though, you're just betting on the price.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:32:28
Bitcoin is a peer to peer decentralized currency. That the whole point of Bitcoin. Robinhood can't exchange peer to peer, is centralized, and likely doesn't even hold bitcoin. It's just a gamble on the price
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:32:20
Watch that be some random early address of lost coins and a blank opendime in the box. For something that tacky I wouldn't be surprised.

If only there was some sort of public ledger that showed where the coins came from

Oh shit! my first tip. Thanks man. lets try this lightning network out!
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:54:25
Robinhood doesn't actually deal with bitcoin. just a gamble on the price.
