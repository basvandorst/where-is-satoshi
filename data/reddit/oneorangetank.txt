The boom created by price controls cannot last. That's why we have the bust.


"Afford." The whole point is that in the unhampered market, people wouldn't take the loans. They would employ there capital elsewhere. Again, the bust happens when the market needs to correct all the bad behavior induced by interventions.




Banks are not required to hold customer deposits in the vault. Rather, they lend some portion out to borrowers with the requirement that they keep the "reserve." Let's say the requirement is 50% for all banks. If you deposit $1000 in your savings account, the bank will turn around and lend $500 of that at interest. The new borrower doesn't immediately spend the money, since it's probably a business loan that needs to be repaid. The borrower deposits some of the money in another bank account and spends against it for business expenses. If $400 is deposited in another bank, that bank is now free to lend $200 in additional loans due to the 50% reserve requirement, and the process continues.
So at this point, your account balance says $1000. The business has $400 in the bank. And someone else can still borrow $200 in a loan. So the total "money supply" as far as money "in the bank" is now $1400, but the total deposited in the bank originally was your $1000.
This is monetary base inflation predicated upon fractional reserve banking. If both you and the business wanted to withdraw all of your money, there would not be enough to go around, and this "run on the bank" would cause them to fold or to give you a "haircut" and only return some of your original deposit.


Monetary base deflation is not present. Price deflation is based on market forces.


Again, citation needed. You can't just say that without proof. The world's economy was based on gold at one point, and there was tremendous growth and prosperity.


The track record of the Fed is not good. After decades of intervention and "guiding the economy," you would think we wouldn't having things like the Great Recession. Greenspan had tamed the business cycle in the '90s, remember?
I say we've had economic growth because we are a market economy with rule of law, not because we have a central bank.
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:01:27


Macroeconomics as defined by Keynes places consumer spending at the core of the economy. Austrians place saving and investment in higher regard.
The Austrian school holds that prices communicate critical information to consumers and businesses alike. Price controls skew the natural decision-making process and lead to economic inefficiency. In particular, the interest rate may be the most critical price, since it conveys time-preference for money itself. By tampering with the interest rates, the central bank institutes price controls on money. And price controls never have the intended effect. Artificially low rates send the wrong signal to borrowers who take out loans they never would have taken if the rates weren't tampered with.
Add to this fractional reserve banking which facilitates money creation out of thin air. Low rates mean people borrow new money, inflating the money supply. That monetary base inflation inevitably leads to price inflation.
At this point, we have inflation caused by intervention in the market and by unsound money principles. This is the boom. It manifests in unpredictable places each time: housing, real estate, commodities.
After the boom comes the bust. Artificially high prices of the bubbling asset cannot be sustained forever. Deflation is the natural tendency of prices to adjust after the bubble bursts. This is where your argument starts, neglecting any of the causes of deflation in the first place. Keynesians want to fight the effects of government intervention in the market with additional government intervention. This is why I disagree with the entire premise.


Citation needed. You neglect the differential effects of (price) deflation. Consider the case where consumer prices are falling faster than wages are falling. That means the individual is actually better off, and their wages purchase more as the deflation continues. 
Look at the massive deflation in technology. Your iPhone would've been $1M in 1980.
Add to all this the confusion with the terminology itself. I haven't been that careful, but we need to distinguish between price inflation and monetary inflation and understand the causal link between the two. 
Neither bitcoin nor gold are deflationary in a monetary sense. Their supply is non-decreasing. The quantity of mined gold will not shrink (barring shipwrecks ;-) ). The quantity of bitcoin is known at all times as well, barring people losing/getting locked out of wallets.
The fatal conceit of the Keynesians is that the central planners know better than the millions of independent economic decisions made by consumers and entrepreneurs every day. But politicians love to surround themselves with Keynesian advisers, since the theory gives them an excuse to meddle in the economy.

The entire Austrian school of economics is devoted to dispelling the Keynesian beliefs you hold. I will not attempt to educate you here. But know that I completely disagree with the conventional wisdom about gold, deflation, consumer spending, etc.
The explanation you believe was provided to you by purveyors of conventional narrative, but most events in history have a other angle that explains things just as well, if not better, than the standard lines. The Austrian school and bitcoin share this in common: the powers that be do not like them.

+1 for Bitcore with a Bitcoin Core back end. Bitcore adds about 50% to the disk requirement for the address index (enabling querying an address balance).

They want to maintain power and perpetuate the state as top priority. That requires either trust / legitimacy or total control. Thankfully democracies tend to go the legitimacy route and not the North Korea route.
Plenty of countries trash their currencies all the time, and it usually doesn't lead to revolution. The people are tricked into believing that the state is on their side again and again.
But government will never choose sound money: the moment that it allows redemption of its notes for gold, then many holders of those notes will want the gold (think foreign governments). Then all the gold will be gone.
