Sorry for your loss and I think about this all the time with my wife, because she will have no clue what to do in case of an accident. Honestly, the coins will probably just be lost. Unless I create some kind of "Do not open unless I am dead" letter and give it to a lawyer.

I know he denied interviews because they were interested in "His" story and what he does has never been about him. But I for one think it would be great if he went out and told his story.

Tied goes in, Tied goes out. What more proof do you need?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:01:28
I don't think that's the point. The point is presenting the account as a representative of Bitcoin, but promoting Bcash. This has been my complaint about Bcash from the beginning. Not whether or not it's better tech, but that it is intentionally trying to convince people it's actually Bitcoin.

I think this is a real question. Most people believe it's a scam using the Bitcoin Name to sucker people in. I'm not saying it is, I'm just saying what most people think. But if you never heard of it, there is no reason to worry about it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:12:41
I think it's good if we have to resort to Asteroid impacts as reasons why BTC may not be a food investment. Do people apply that to Carbon 3D and OLED and others, or just BTC I wonder.

If you transfer it from a different address to Coinomi it won't work. It will have either needed to be in Coinomi at the time of the fork, or like me, I had my BTC on a Paper Wallet prior to the fork.
Depending on where your Bitcoin was at the time of the fork, you may or may not be able to claim your Bitcoin Cash.
I claimed my Bitcoin cash on Coinomi and Sold it at $1,300. With recent prices, I sort of wish I just held on to it to see what happens, but a real big part of me doesn't want any involvement with anything that Roger Ver and Friends are behind, regardless of price.

No one knows the exact likelihood, I think that's the point. I am not claiming it will, I am claiming it can. Two very different things. 
And yes, Nuclear war is possible. And Despite the response below, probably a bit less likely, at least on a global catastrophic scale. There may be a few strategic nukes dropped here and there. But if I had to make a wager, I would say it's more likely Bitcoin fails (Probably due to all the infighting) then it is for a global nuclear Armageddon, at least in the near future. World events could change literally day by day. Trump may just want to Nuke North Korea just for fun. No way I can predict that.

I'm looking for suggestions. Do you have any? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:56:16
I could be wrong, but I never saw BTC as a replacement for gold. I saw the Digital Gold or Gold 2.0 as an analogy but not that the intent was to take over gold. I don't think Gold is going anywhere. I'm kind of tired of arguing about Gold vs BTC. They both have their merits and both have their pros and cons. To me it's been BTC vs Fiat not backed by gold (And centralization etc). I could be wrong, but that's what I thought this was about.
There is more then enough room and reason for people to consider holding both Gold and BTC in whatever amounts you are comfortable with. 
Gold is impracticable in many circumstances, but if the shit really hits the fan and we have no electrical grid. It probably won't be bad to hold some gold. I think some of each is a smart way to go unless something changes.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:02:42

@_date: 2017-12-16 06:12:52
Belief doesn't matter. If it was the original it would be called Bitcoin. It's not, so it's an Alt Coin. Maybe better, maybe worse, but still an Alt Coin and not Bitcoin. That's the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:51:36
I'm very confused. I thought the Segwit forked already happened. How are there Segwit and None Segwit BTC? How do I know which I own and which I am using and how do I differentiate between them. I am relatively new, so please, don't be harsh. My BTC is on Coinbase. Do I have Segwit coins or not? If I move them to somewhere else do they become segwit coins? Argh! This crap is what is slowing adoption.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:29:58
Long before Bitcoin, I lost my house and pets in a fire. Everything I owned, except what was in my car. Sounds like you got out better off than most. Honestly, the pets were the hardest part. Everything else has since been replaced to the extent that it could.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:51:52
So don't buy any gold if you don't want to. I'm just saying it's a far more stable investment than BTC "At this point". Things can change rapidly. But holding gold has never turned out bad over the long term. BTC is promising but questionable .

What he did was, donate and match the USD amount of the Bitcoin at the time, Donated it all in USD, but kept the BTC on his phone to see what would happen. Said it's not his BTC so he will leave it up to them to cash it in or keep it in BTC, but will still match current value as well. That's how I heard it. Please correct me if I am mistaken. Maybe he isn't matching the current value, but just giving the total BTC over to Justin to decide what to do with. But he never cashed in the BTC. Just donated cash value and kept the coin. Pretty cool if you ask me.

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:18:58
Yeah, what you are saying. It's a little different if there is a regional issue vs a global one. Of course Gold will have value if there is just a regional issue and the rest of the world is basically as is. People will want the regional gold. Of course you could argue, they would want to take local people's BTC as well, knowing it has value in other unaffected areas. But yes, in this case, gold would be fine. BTC  and it's supporters should stop trying to sound Anti-Gold. As I understand it, that is not the point or message. There is nothing wrong with Gold.

Yes it is. It may not be a perfect currency constantly used everywhere. But it is a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:26:44
Well, it is now. But if you are talking about 'Old Southern Money" chances are it dates back to Plantation Slavery. The Slavery is not even the point. The point was the guy inherited this money and did nothing 'Wise" to obtain it. It was just the luck of being born in a wealthy 'Southern" family.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:15
Sounds like you might be able to answer this. For merchants to use the LN, are they going to need to add another sign, like "We accept Bitcoin, and Lightning" or will it just be presented as Bitcoin and use the LN? 
I'm trying to figure out if it will be confusing to the merchants that currently accept Bitcoin. Does someone need to tell them they need to include LN or will it just happen for them? Because it seems like it will be confusing for them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:54:24

I just get confused between Altcoins like Dash, Zcash, Bcash, Etc that seem to be intended as a currency and coins like IOTA and others that seem to be coins intended to fund a project. Does LN network impact these coins that aren't not really intended to be currency but a funding an idea, like a smart internet or other etc or just coins that are intended to be currencies like BTC?

I have Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and some experimental alt coins. I'm totally on board and have faith.

If you don't have it currently written down and secured somewhere, log into Coinbase now and you can create/request a new one. Do this before you lose or get a new phone. Otherwise you might have to completely restore your account which is a major pain in the ass and might not even work.

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:02:35
Gold isn't a maybe. It just doesn't have the astronomical gains that BTC has had recently. In fact, many would say it's stability is it's strength. I would consider some of each. If you own some Gold, you have a pretty good idea of what it will be worth in a few years. If you just have BTC instead, you may have tons more or far less. I can't see much of long term downside to gold. It has been recognized as a store of value for 1000's of years. You can't just toss that aside like it means nothing. As much of a fan of BTC as I am, it's long term survival is in question at this point.

Thanks for the info. One follow up.
When you say "Transfer Coins to another address" do you mean, create another wallet online and transfer to there? So transfer to another private address or back to a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:47:54
Is there a minimum amount required to open an account?

Thanks, but I clicked on that github link and had no clue what I was looking at or what I was supposed to do with the info.
Am I supposed to do that offline or does it matter? Will I get a QR code? It was just a bunch of long numbers to me.
But I appreciate the help, I just think that was over my head at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:29:55
Yeah, sorry if my ignorance made the question confusing.
I think I'm clear I could send it back to a new paper wallet.
I was asking about transferring to another online wallet (In the same wallet ap, like Bread Wallet etc). In other words, do I need to create a whole new wallet with a new user name and password online? If that doesn't make sense, then don't worry about answering.
But - What do I use to create a BCH/BCC Wallet? Can I still use bitaddress.org or is there something specific for BCC?

I'm new to Crypto and don't know all the technical arguments between the 2 coins, But Roger reminds me way too much of Little Finger for me to trust him and his intentions. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:08:47
I think he might have just been asking a question, not making a point. But I could be wrong.

@_date: 2017-11-22 23:56:20
I came in pretty recently, not really understanding the technical differences between the two coins. But all I had to do was watch a few videos of Roger Ver to know he was shady and untrustworthy. Then I learned about his past that confirmed what I already felt. Even if his coin has the better tech, I still won't support it simply because he and that Fake Satoshi dude are behind it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:17:48
I don't know about that. I had a post deleted by a bot simply by asking a question about the timing of these latest forks. It said I mentioned an Altcoin and the post didn't belong here. I thought that was kind of harsh. I was just asking a question.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:25:38
This is the kind of stuff that scares the shit out of newcomers. And the kind of thing people point to when they say it's scammy. I hate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:48:39
Exactly. All of the above changes if Net Neutrality doesn't exist and you can't go to Coinbase, Coinomi or Jaxx etc. If that happens you're in your back yard with a homemade tinfoil satellite dish trying to get a signal from space. Not good for mass adoption

Maybe true. But 99.9% of the population doesn't know how to do any of that. So that won't work for mass adoption.

I agree. Bitcoin's problem is mass adoption. But I think one of the hurdles to mass adoption is convincing people it's not a crime coin. It's the first thing that comes up every time I talk to someone about it for the first time. They all believe the US will just ban it if it gets too big. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:43:43
Isn't it a bit contradicting to say "Good Luck using Bitcoin in North Korea" (Because of the Governments control over the internet) and then also saying there is no way Bitcoin can be shut down by a Government?

I hear what everyone is saying. But ask the average person, not a tech savvy person, to try and play Texas Holdem, right now, online from the US for cash.....Legally or not. They shut that shit down and the and it had no effect on the Country as a whole. Sure it's doable. But not by the average person. And we need the average person to be able to freely use Bitcoin for it to survive. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:12:15
It's verified because the amount of BTC will show up in his wallet. I don't  think he 'Needs" to, but I believe it's best practice to create a new address to receive funds each time, or at least change it up regularly.

Some people think there is a connection between the Number of the Beast in the Bible book of Revelations and the fact that Bitcoin is Digital and people have a number for their funds. It's not very compelling to be honest.  I think that's all he is referring to.

You're right, he should make his friends looks stupid live online to 2 Million People instead. That would really help him out. They are his friends, he doesn't have to agree with everything they say, nor try to tear them to shreds when they differ. I think the listeners "Should" be smart enough to read between the lines. He's been friends with Eddie for years, his goal isn't to humiliate him or his other friends.

Sell it back to Coinbase and have it deposited into the Bank Account you used to buy it with. Or send it to a registered Paypal account. There will be a high coinbase fee for doing this and I believe there is a cap of 10K per transaction with some time between each. So there is no way, with Coinbase to cash out 2 Million Dollars worth of Bitcoin in one step.

I believe if you have your 12 word phrase you are totally covered. But I am extra paranoid so I transferred all my funds to a paper wallet which gives me my personal private key directly. I can later import it into any wallet that supports the coin of my choice. My only question is, can I import it into both sides of the fork or just one. I haven't gotten a clear answer yet.
