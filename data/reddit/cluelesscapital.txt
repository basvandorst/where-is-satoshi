Sure, but the fact that a generalisation might be true in some cases doesn't make generalisations any less psychologically harmful. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:41:15
Not sure what you mean by that?
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:20:53
Good point. I'll grant that the perceived sexism is not necessarily intentional, whether it's reasonable to be upset by unintentional offensiveness is another topic i guess. 
As for why I don't think the subject of the meme is about people who wear red, well, I think that would be quite an abstract interpretation. It' seems clear to me that what is portrayed here is a wife's feelings about her husbands bitcoins―the quote from the woman makes it clear that the topic of the meme is either one, or many women's feelings about their husbands bitcoins.  
The point is that you can debate how to interpret this, but from my perspective, I wouldn't blame a woman for feeling irked by this because it's easily interpreted as a insensitive joke about how women are, reasons being that the meme portrays a stereotype that I know a lot of women are all too familiar with and also sick to death of―that they are hysterical and lack analytical thinking skills. The kinds of women who are most likely to be feel irritated by this meme are the ones who would be interested in joining the crypto community. 
I see your point, it is easy to see sexism as a result of confirmation bias and I reject most of what SJW types usually complain about, however, in this case, the image just struck a wrong chord for me.
What I also think is true is that sexism is a real problem, but the subject has been hijacked by extremists on both ends of the spectrum. This has divided people into two groups―people who see sexism everywhere and people who seem to deny it exists altogether. I'm in the middle. I see that there's an existential quality to this phenomenon―much of what we perceive is subject to what we project onto it, but I also see a lot of overtly patronising attitudes towards women from men every day.

How much are you betting?
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:18:06
Okay so you think my definition of sexism is wrong. What is your definition of sexism?
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:35:33
How is it not sexist to make an implied generalisation about the other sex? This post portrays wives as desperate idiots (with a picture of a desperate woman) who are incapable of understanding cryptocurrencies. It's only "not-sexist" if you choose to ignore that. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:42:38
It would still rub me the wrong way, but I'd have less of a problem with it because it wouldn't seemingly be promoting a negative stereotype―which is the thing I have an issue with. 
If the subject of the meme was a man and it seemed to promote some negative stereotype about men like 
Men being emotionally numb morons
Men being slobs 
Men being "all the same"
Men are all cheaters 
Men are lazy 
Etc etc
Then I'd be equally irritated. I just don't like gender stereotypes and gender roles in general. I think men and women should be inclusive of each other in communities and if a lot of women are saying "look, some of us are really into stuff that you guys are into like computers and engineering etc, we're tired of other guys making jokes about us being hysterical and not good at analytical stuff" then the right thing to do is for guys in those communities to pay attention to that and make women feel more welcome. Works both ways, but generally speaking I don't think there are many female dominated industries where men wish women made them feel more included, but I do think there are a lot of male-dominated industries where more could be done to make women feel more welcomed. I am not advocating for companies making sure 50% of their hires are female, because that doesn't make sense to me. I just think when communities embrace sensitivity,  diplomacy and open-mindedness towards these issues it's a win-win for everyone. Trying to debate this stuff like only one side can be right won't get anyone anywhere.

Good points. To counter, there isn't much that suggests that it is about a specific woman. What makes this post potentially offensive to some is that it is easily interpreted as a generalisation, and when someone doesn't care about how something could be interpreted it's insensitive. 


I disagree, this assertion rests on the assumption that the only way to interpret the meme is that it's about a specific woman, not women in general―but I think it's easily interpreted as a generalisation and therefore deserves a small red flag. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:51:59
Very good points! You've given me pause for thought. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:27:47
Why do you keep emphasising that it's a joke. Off-base messaging is off-base whether it's a joke, corporate announcement or campaign ad. 
Adding a comment that says "hey, I know it maybe looks like I was portraying a common female stereotype but if you didn't get the joke I'm just highlighting one of the issues with bitcoin" is not complicated. 
It might be hard for you to see, but casual viewers, newcomers to crypto, and women who put up with this stereotype every day will maybe interpret this meme negatively. Saying "well that wasn't the intention of the OP" doesn't really solve the problem―it just illustrates that you don't value diplomacy and sensitivity. 
Please don't think I'm trying to police other people. All I did was express my irritation.

I think "cultural Marxism" is alt-right vernacular. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:30:42
if I assume for a second that that is true, it's still a slap in the face to any women who are good with numbers and have an interest in crypto to see this kind of messaging when they come to the space. Women make up 50% of the population, if crypto enthusiasts want it to go mainstream, then alienating 50% of the population with childish passive aggressive memes is not the way to do it. 


Did you assume I was a woman? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:16:42
I'm not accusing the OP of sexism, I'm saying the messaging of the meme has implied sexism. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:20:01
Yeah, good point. My issue is not the OP's intentions, but that it albeit unintentionally seems to portray a common stereotype about women, and that it's insensitive to pretend that that isn't an issue. See my conversation with dalebewan above for why I think this is an issue. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:57:29
Oh cool. Sexism. ಠ_ಠ 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:28:39
Haha. Thanks for the tip. I will try to use my brain less in future. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:12:42
How convenient. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:01:24
Feasibly yes. In response to your comment, a picture of one woman can symbolise women in general. And the stereotype I'm talking about is probably the oldest one of all―that women are hysterical and can't handle complicated or technical things. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:24:23
How am I promoting that?
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:13:54
Pretty easily, you would show both a husband and a wife having the same complex to make it more clear that you're not trying to promote the common stereotype that women are hysterical and volant deal with technical problems. Maybe leave a comment to make it clear that your intentions are not to promote a stereotype. 
I wasn't that worked up about it, I think people assume that I must be because only hysterical SJWs worry about things like sexism. It's a small issue, but worth talking about because if we want crypto to go mainstream we should try to ensure the community is inclusive. 
Sorry if I've ruined your fun, you could just ignore my opinions however. That's what I do when I'm not in the mood for other people's opinions.
