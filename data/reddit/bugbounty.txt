No, the password cannot be reset with the previous token.
The password reset link will always work and won't indicate whether the token is good or not. The reset won't succeed if the token is invalid, but you won't know this until you actually try to perform the reset.
So Kraken does not, and did not, have this vulnerability. Again, the form *always* appears when you click the link, but that does *not* mean it's actually valid. You won't know whether it's valid until you actually reset the password.
In the future, please report bugs directly to bugbounty
We respond promptly to reports submitted directly.

[Kraken]( has offered something similar to this for quite a while. Quote:
The Global Settings Lock is an enhanced security feature that helps prevent tampering of your account information by an attacker that has gained access to your account. When enabled, the following account information is locked and cannot be immediately changed:
* Account settings
* Password
* Notifications
* **Withdrawal addresses**
* Verification information (also hidden)
* Two-factor authentication (also hidden)
* API keys (also hidden)
The settings lock also hides certain sensitive information in your account.

Kraken fixes bugs that are reported directly to bugbounty

I've been a Gox user since early 2011. My email was leaked when they were hacked in June 2011. They sent me a free YubiKey, which kept me on their exchange for perhaps a week. But I withdrew 100% of my funds from them when they shut down USD withdrawals last year. This was a long, long time coming.
The fact that they were trading for months at a 10% premium over all other exchanges should be the final proof that their "price" is utterly irrelevant in every way. Now their low price is gaining them even more attention and press. Ridiculous. As long as people still talk about Gox, some people are going to think they're a legitimate exchange. They're not. Ignore them and move on.

This was a false alarm: a user's password could not, and can not, be reset with an old token.
The password reset link will always work and won't indicate whether the token is good or not. The reset won't succeed if the token is invalid, but you won't know this until you actually try to perform the reset.
So Kraken does not, and did not, have this vulnerability. Again, the form *always* appears when you click the link, but that does *not* mean it's actually valid. You won't know whether it's valid until you actually reset the password.

We should switch to mBTC (or mXBT) - the idea that you have to buy a "whole" bitcoin is common and very misleading.
