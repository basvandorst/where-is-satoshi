not at all they got out on high from bitcoin bought some alts, sold them and the massive sell out and now heading to some vacation trips, most believe that the game is over with private crypto... next wave will be gov-backed currencies 
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:22:20


so mildly over such a long period of time that if statistics as a science did not exist we would never know about it, but what I doubt the most is that bitcoin could potentially solve any of those problems even in theoretical perspective, in reality, it will make old currency system looks like lost paradise, that is for sure

do you really believe it going to last 20 years ? or 2 years ? I don't... look at the competition, on one hand and on regulations that will be in place soon on the other hand, do you still see the place for bitcoin ?  
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:07:38
I heard it all before, and do not believe it anymore even a bit, it sounds more like a lunacy to me, "a central point of failure", this is fake adage, there is no real risk factor behind, it is all made to fail to make news and so on ... there are many ways to improve security with a fraction of the cost of bitcoin mining, it is all kind of artificial to me now

wrong ! this is fantasy man, I am certainly not complaining about my success in investment strategies but you have missed an important part in my response which is the timing. I typically get out of winning investment when I have made 10%-15% more what I invested, but if I stay longer I would have made 50% or even 100% more, but that is called gambling not investing your money

do not makeup facts, for first 10 years of public internet nobody knew if it will ever take off it had no public utility it has nothing back then, no social media, no news, no reddit, it had zero value for the public, email appeared much later, it was so slow, it was dial-up, computers very so slow that you would not even understand what is it how people could possibly do anything on internet , and they did not , it was useless for very long time . do not make up facts and do not lie.   
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:11:39
because I do, and I do not pretend, so can you, if you obtain enough of facts it is like mathematical equation you can't go wrong, you can not time the market, but predict the course of event you surely can, it is easy and I am never wrong on facts of my predictions, timing the market is what makes all forecast a gamble of chance. I do not know when bitcoin will disappear, but it surely will, it has already accomplished its mission impossible. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:00:20
nowhere there is no such options available, that is the idea of the bank cartel, but my question is why do you need it, and how many people might potentially need it?

@_date: 2018-06-26 03:53:28
sorry man but it sounds more like lunacy for a non-adept of bitcoin, except criminals and for shady operation like hiding away money from tax department or transfer money outside the country of origin usually illegally obtained money into another country where it will not be pursued by law, bitcoin has no value no merit for normal people what so ever, not now not ever in to the future. 
it was a beautiful story but the show is over now move on ... 
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:20:08


the absolutely correct statement even more so it with the line of the law of physics and nature, that what keeps univers from falling apart. the idea of decentralization is about creating an extra layer of control one more step in the pyramid, nothing more, but it has powerful psychological appeal to people but no real value or benefits whatsoever

I did and really happy about it , and now wonder what is holding you
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:49:56
I won't, to me crypto is a beautiful idea but it is utopia an absurd that goes against the logic of life as we know it. crypto will be around soon as a part of our life but it will be backed but gov.  it will have limited use since its utility is limited. outside of the criminal world, nobody really needed. paying for a cup of coffee in the country of your travel to avoid having you real money account being stolen you will use some form of smart payments like the crypto wallet with bitcoin payment system in it. what else do you need it for?    if there will be no utility for cryptocurrency the value of crypto will fall like a stone in the water, so no one will be using it for storing assets money equivalents. today only those of criminal intent interested in the crypto use and those people who want to make money on the rise of the value of crypto because of demand for cryptocurrencies from criminally intended people. avoiding taxation is also criminal intent. give a good reason why anybody would be interested in cryptocurrencies? the whole idea of holding crypto is to make money on it by exchanging it for real money, while it will continue to circulate among criminally intended people. 
the future of crypto is very simple as soon as liquidity of other than bitcoin currencies improve you will reach the point of saturation meaning you will oversupply cryptocurrencies to the market of criminal markets, then value will start to drop, as soon as it happed bubble will burst because all other  holders of bitcoin will want it to be sold since it will hold no value as a currency since it has no utility outside of the shadow market. today bitcoin exists only by the artificial limit of supply. the idea is beautiful but implementation is sucks 
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:54:46
if you are not joking those were very slow growth, more stagnant than growth actually, internet is not a company there is no country economy behind it likewise bitcoin it cannot be priced from economic point of view it has no value "in principle" only hype, in the same way, the tower of Eiffel in Paris was sold by one scummers to other scummers two or tree time in one sort of speak transaction. it is a public property with no value like a monument to an event, no utility value ... like bitcoin potential utility value is so minimal that present cost of operation=mining will never ever recover the "cost of investment " it will never make sense to operate bitcoin and financial tool to transfer money. 
for you info Microsoft proportionally to it global operation is grossly undervalued and Amazon all his long life as a company was in huge debts and many believed he would never recover, only time and patience saved him and diversification in the domain of economy he has never been interested at... so you have two extremely bad examples
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:27:18
and most probably it is the most practical decision on your part I would say, it should be a nice way out of your predicament, some big funds will come in to speculate that will drive prices up for some time while they will buy out a certain base to speculate with. and then inevitably they will drive the price of bitcoin to its real value in terms of the price of utility, which is very minimal in comparison to all other financial instruments to transfer money from point A to point B. Hype is certainly over, the inertia will run bitcoin for some time and the demand from big funds will let you get out with good profit
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:45:01


sure, get onboard at the very early stages and get out at the maximum, it is no brainer, very simple hype based bubble , no practical sense of utility for potential consumers-users, conflict with the law in all major countries of the world . what future it will have ? $5-$50 due to some limited use in countries like venezuelly mexico iran etc in 5 years, in next 2-3 years funds speculations will drive the price down, this is the last yeat price flactuate so you can get out and go back to school to get some profession, bitcoin is not a vehicle that can feed you in the future
