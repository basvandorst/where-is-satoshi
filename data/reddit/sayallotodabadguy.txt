Spending the extra on the mortgage gives you a real guaranteed return in the form of equity. Diverting to bitcoin at best lets you pay the mortgage off quicker at the risk of bitcoin going to zero, making you pay far more interest on the mortgage in the long run. Not worth the risk if it's going to make you live paycheck to paycheck in the case your gamble fails.

You need to have a bank to do this for several reasons (primary one being to evaluate and mitigate risks) but the sentiment here is "be your own bank" so most people are just going to tuck away their keys and never lend the money.

Holding only actually works when you're buying an asset that has actual value such as equities or real estate. These are assets that produce an actual return. E.g., equities are ownership of companies that produce goods and services, contributing to net wealth creation (since people desire these things and buy providing them, youve created wealth); and in the case of real estate, land can be used to build structures for residences, businesses, or agriculture, again contributing to economic growth because they provide goods and services that people desire. These types of investments create **actual** wealth. So it makes sense to hold them.
Bitcoin's value is purely psychological since it's backed by nothing more than what one may expect some idiot in the future to value them at. Holding bitcoin is as smart as holding beanie babies. Actually no, holding beanie babies is better since atleast you have a physical doll that some homeless kid might want to play with at some point when you throw them in the trash.

No. You can't easily convert $3 million of actual money to bitcoin on any exchange at the moment. Doing so would push the price up very fast because it is a highly illiquid and thinly traded market.
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:51:03
Using actual money like US dollars or Euros is a voluntary system. You don't have to accept that as payment from your employer, and you aren't required to use them when buying things at the store.

Actually, no. Quite the opposite.
If I print up a bunch of pieces of paper and write down "I promise to give you one apple when you turn in this note" on each of them and then give one of those pieces of paper to my friend Bob in exchange for an orange that he has, you could say my currency is backed by apples. But not really.
It's actually backed by the promise I'll give him one when the time comes. Being backed by something means you trust that the backer will give you that thing in the future.

Being out $600 on a bitcoin (had you purchased late last year) would suck, but its not life breaking. Median household income is $50k per year in the US. For most people that's less than 1 week's pay.
The people that will be needing the hotline got in way over their heads and put in 50k or more without selling and now wake up every day to compounding losses. When you realize that you lost the equivalent of a brand new SUV in the span of less than a year, it can be difficult to think rationally and ditch a poor investment. I see this happen to people for non-bitcoin related investments as well. They're expecting a certain return and then when they don't get it they start doubling down, throwing good money after bad, and start to despair when things don't turn around. They go in with the mindset that it **has** to get better. Problem is, the world is a cruel place and there's no guarantee that's going to happen.

I'm sorry, but just because you want it to be money doesn't mean it is.
British pounds are money because I can order British made goods, pay them with pounds (which they actually accept, unlike bitpay where they immediately exchange it into real money) and then ship my item. That economy that sits behind the pound is gigantic, and there is a tremendous amount of people that accept it. You can say similar of other actual money currencies like CAD, USD, JPY, EUR, etc.
In the bitcoin space, almost no one accepts and then keeps bitcoins as money. They always exchange it to real money. Which is precisely why bitcoin isn't money.

This is unequivocally false. If you owe a $500k debt to the state, or to the federal government, or to a credit card company, and you offer up payment entirely in pennies, they must accept it. If they choose not to accept the payment, you can go to court and have the debt discharged since pennies are legal tender and you offered payment with legal tender, but it was refused.
Legal tender means you cannot refuse it as payment to **satisfy a debt within a legal framework**.

The price literally doesn't matter. At all. The reason for this is that the only real use-case of Bitcoin is for illegal businesses. Businesses that are run using actual money like dollars, euros, yen, etc. but that have to hide or secretly transfer this money around. They just go to the exchange with their real money, change it at whatever the spot price is, move it around, and then change it back to real money again. For this purpose, the criminal enterprise doesn't care what the price is. Either $20 or $200 per bitcoin is just the same since the transaction results in a net zero position in bitcoin at the end.

You know that cash (and cash "equivalents" like bitcoin is supposed to be) aren't the only assets in existence right?
Most people who are doing the right thing and saving money for retirement or even medium term purchases invest money in assets that are actually valuable like equity, bonds, and real estate. That's actually where the vast majority of owned wealth exists.
Assets such as dollars, euros, even bitcoin, are a very small fraction of that and only exist to facilitate transactions of items that actually have value.
For someone doing the right thing as far as wealth accumulation and appreciation goes, bitcoin doesnt matter just as much as having dollars doesnt matter. I personally have less than 5% of my net worth in cash/cash equivalents. I don't really have a need for it besides paying for immediate expenses and day to day things. I don't care what the inflation rate is because I'm never holding that much of it, because in the grand scheme of things it only exists to facilitate exchange.

They're not biting any hand. They take absolutely no risk because they price things in real money (dollars) and then do the conversion right away. They get to increase the pool of interested buyers and profit from this. What exactly is wrong with that? It seems like the only reason you don't like it is that it depresses the bitcoin price which then affects your holdings. But the company doesn't care about your holdings, the only person who should care about that is you. It's a good thing that they're doing this.

I cannot understand infatuation with how cheap it is apparently to move money. As if more than 1 or 2 people in this entire sub will ever have this problem in their lifetime.
First of all, almost any major bank will move this money for you for free, or almost for free. Even if they charged $30, the amount is insignificant given that you're moving 36 something million fucking dollars.
Second of all, in the time that it takes for the blockchain to confirm the transaction, its value will drop or rise by an amount far greater than the transaction fee that even the most expensive traditional bank will charge. It isn't uncommon for bitcoin's value to drop 1% in 20 minutes time. If you lose 1% of $37 million thats 370000 dollars. That isn't an insignificant amount.

If you think that the stock price increased that much because bitcoin added 0.25% to revenue, you're all kinds of crazy delusional.

Maybe you should ask why they even want it in the first place? Are they wanting to buy to speculate or actually transact with? Unless they're actually interested in using it as money, I doubt the general public wants or needs Bitcoin. It has to solve a problem in their life to be attractive. As it stands, for the vast majority of people, Bitcoin solves no problems.

I think you're using the wrong word here. It's pretty intuitive how it works. You buy bitcoins and then sit on your ass and pump it up to other idiots that then increase the price you can sell them back (for fiat nonetheless) on an open market.
I think you meant to say **counter productive**. Because that's what bitcoin really is. It's an "investment" that doesn't produce any actual value or solves any pressing existing financial problems. Which is exactly why this quote from OP is incredibly hilarious:

The money supply **has** to increase as the economy grows to keep parity of the monetary unit. However, you're confused about something. Increasing money supply is not the same as inflation. They're typically coincidental, but as is with the case Japan, the size of the money supply increased despite deflation.
It's incorrect terminology to say Japan's money supply was inflating. This is because inflation is not defined by the change in the money supply. It is only defined by the change in price levels of goods and services in an economy.

It's not just electricity cost. Companies have to produce specialized hardware that does nothing but hashing. That equipment isn't cheap, and it has to be replaced constantly due to increasing difficulty. That's a pretty bad misallocation of resources when those same companies could be producing computing hardware that produces an actual benefit.
Then you also have the wasted human capital of all the people involved to build, deploy, and manage these devices.
Further more, there are pretty much required fees that have to be tacked onto transactions smaller than a certain size if the coins have been moved recently.
And lastly there is the block chain reward of 3600 coins a day which are paid to miners. That's money that comes out of the pocket of everyone who owns bitcoins since it directly devalues their purchasing power.

The answer for me is that it's been diddly squat for the past several years. All anyone ever talks about here is the price of bitcoin or what merchant is adopting it. Very little discussion about fixing the core problems bitcoin has that prevents it from having any actual value for the majority of human beings on this planet.

I dont understand. Why dont you just convert your bitcoins to real money and then use your real money to buy stuff? It's easier that way.
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:44:52
You're a paid shill. Just confess.

Arbitration is less than worthless without a legal apparatus to enforce it. Of course you would understand that if you weren't writhing on the ground suffering from Koolaid poisoning.

I literally just answered your question in the post you just responded to. Reread it please.
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:44:09
Toters magoters correct. When BTC is worth 3 million that easily makes you a quadrillionaire and you'll be able to literally own people that may or may not be your sex slaves.

I want to know the answer to this as well. I would love to whore my ass to some shilling company and get paid to shit on idiot bitcoin speculators all day, alas I'm just doing this for fun at the moment.
OP, seriously, hit me up with a link or something where I can get a paid gig doing this. I can use the side money.

Yes. Manufacture of hashing hardware is the most wasteful thing ever. They're only profitable for a few months at most. This is one of the brilliant side effects of Satoshi's grand idea.

Can't be butthurt when I just made an assload of money putting in a short  earlier this morning.

It can't be built into the price, because that assumes instant transfer of information about the state of all market participants positions (and future positions) to all other market participants. Fact is, saying "it's priced in" is a cop out for people that don't want to do any critical thinking.

You'll have to worry about being put in federal prison for tax evasion and money laundering charges though.

You're actually kind of being a cunt. Giving a couple dishware is an acceptable wedding gift. Giving them bitcoin is not.

This is preposterous. John Nash is an old fart who doesn't have the time to be working on this shit.

Theirs is cheaper though. Its only $0. The one on the right costs money so why would I use it?

By definition it's spam. You're offering nothing of value in exchange for forced advertising of a product that is not desired or needed.
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:48:08
Wrong. You participate in society and therefore have a moral duty to pay for the things that you would otherwise be getting for free: legal and police protection, property rights, access to infrastructure, and the resources necessary to create and run businesses. If you don't want to pay for these things then you're free to not participate in society. We won't miss you. Otherwise, you *will* pay your taxes as we have collectively decided that you will.

More cheap coinz when this pushes the price down :)

Doesn't matter. Even a checking account for a business of such dubious practices is a major risk to the bank and they're right to kick him to the curb as he deserves. If he can come up with a real business that doesn't involve trading currencies used for illegal narcotics and money laundering, maybe they'd be willing to take him in.

So that we can make the guy that created the tipping bot rich with his 1% fee? No thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:04:19
He means go start or buy a business that accepts bitcoin only, or start spending your bitcoins on goods and services. Otherwise you're not participating in the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:04:56
It's BitCon after all. Safer to just assume it's a scam unless you have solid evidence that it's not.

Inherent isn't the same as intrinsic. That's an important distinction. Sometimes I say inherent and people think what I mean to say is intrinsic.
Inherent, as in inherited value. The US government possesses a vast military power and a robust economic base from which to generate tax revenues. Due to its size and stability, you can trust that if you lend something to the US government, there is a very high certainty that they will pay you back with something of equal (or near equal) value in the future. It doesn't matter if we're talking currency or property or whatever other assets; we have a high level of confidence that the US government isn't going to be a deadbeat in returning those assets.
So the US dollar is an extension of that trust, which gives it inherent value. That, and the fact that failing to pay taxes results in penalties and possible jailtime. There is inherent value added in that US dollars are a necessity to keep oneself out of prison in the case that he/she earns an income or runs a business in some capacity.
