Than you! As far as I am aware their cards aren’t ready to go? Or they have ran out of cards?

Thank you! Are you able to deposit BTC onto it do you know? 
My issue is I trade in bitcoin and usually do peer to peer cash deals so I’m stuck with the issue of not being able to use the money I’ve made from my trades as I can’t put it into a bank account. As you know as soon as the banks hear your funds are coming from BTC they shut them down...

As in they have cards ready to be shipped out. As far as I remember I was put onto a waiting list for the next batch of cards to be released?

Thanks for the response that is exciting! 
Will we be able to deposit BTC from our own wallets onto coincorner and then spend them with our new cards?

Wow that is seriously exciting! What sort of verifications do they ask when signing up? 
I’m looking to deposit quite a considerable amount of bitcoin as at the moment it is just in cash which isn’t any use to me from my peer to peer trades. 
Thanks for your response :)
