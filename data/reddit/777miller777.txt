Bitcoins are already making the world nicer because I can do whatever I want with MY OWN money and everyone will slowly understand this. I am sorry you do not 
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:39:49
No, but I can still store my bitcoins offline which my gun protects very well. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:42:34
All the work has been done, bitcoin is already here and is free for anyone in the world

Failure the investigate XtremeMiners. Scammed my family over 15 grand....

How exactly? Using bitcoins to strip away our governments' ability to tax is a great start. Obviously this is a bit extreme, but maybe we can find a middle ground once the governments realize they cannot do anything to stop bitcoins from growing. I bet even if the US outlawed bitcoin there would be a short dip in price, but would eventually continue on it's way to $10,000

Merchants can go underground and work through tor. They could also never stop individuals from accepting bitcoin

Our government is spending WAY more than it has and its only option is to print more money which will put them further into debt (the federal reserve LOANS the US government money). Eventually a wheelbarrow of  fiat currency won't even be worth a piece of crap.

Maybe, but then again as of now it is not illegal, plus you could use tor. Also, soon every single bitcoin transaction will be automatically routed through tor by default in the upcoming bitcoin update.

I don't care about government protection. I have a gun, that's all the protection I need. The government may try to regulate or outlaw bitcoin, but all efforts will be futile. Bitorrents have been around for over 10 years and no government has been able to do anything. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:55:05
I don't have to do anything at all. Bitcoins will slowly take over the world by itself and all I have to do is watch as all the debt based fiat currencies crumble along with all the bankers and politicians that support slavery.

How can this mention napster, but then not talk about how the governments of the world have not been able to do anything to stop bittorrents!?
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:04:07
Thank you for the suggestion.

I believe the only thing the government could do is regulate the exchanges where you get fiat, but there will always be sites like localbitcoins. If the US really wants to put me in jail for using bitcoins, I'll just move to Canada where they have nice and convenient ATMs. 
They will not ever be able to regulate the bitcoin protocol and that is fact.

What exactly funds the state's protection? Financial regulation including taxes

Also bitcoins can be traded easily for other crypto currencies. I do not believe bitcoin will be king forever. In the world of crypto currencies bitcoin is already old and outdated. All bitcoin users and merchants could just as easily start accepting a coin that was not ultra pre-mined and has much faster and secure transactions 
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:34:13
Or maybe people use bitcoins because we do not want to be enslaved by a debt based fiat monetary system. Plus, who really wants the government to know what you buy, where you buy it, when you buy it, exactly how much you spend. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:05:31
Bitcoins solves all these problems. Bam 
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:38:08
But governments cannot use physical force such as a military to bitcoin, it only exists virtually

You don't need an account or a wallet for shared coins. All you have to do is enter the address where you want untainted coins to go, then they will give you another address to send the coins to. 
Another popular mixing service is bitfog: 
Someone please verify the link or just google "bitfog mixer." I would say it is probably more secure because you can only access it over tor, but the fees are much more 1-3% randomized or a standard 0.5% for shared send.

Let's see zerocoin implemented in litecoins!! I believe it would definitely make litecoins more valuable especially as bitcoins are being spied on with ever increasing scrutiny by the governments of the world. Litecoins already have Atlantis! To have complete anonymity could literally turn the tides for both bitcoins and the silkroad. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:11:27
I honestly don't give a crap if bitcoin gets zerocoin. I just want it somewhere. If there was a developer committed to implementing zerocoin I would even donate money... 
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:01:24
This needs to happen now!!!
