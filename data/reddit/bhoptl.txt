Well, we did vote. Our president, assuming you are from the US, won through electoral votes. When he was campaigning, he did say he will be tough on biased trades (although I didn't think he would pull this off in his first two years). We can't be voting for every little issues. There's no such thing as a true democracy. I don't have time to read every God damn bills Senate propose everyday. I go and vote for someone that represents majority of my priorities and views.
Like I said, I am on the side of fair trade. It will certainly impact our economy, but I hope in the long run, it improves. Acts of our current President (I'm a registered Democrat, btw), will surely help to delay or impact China's expansion into Africa, Australia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and other countries in Middle East or South Asia. China is a big bully with that extra trade money from all around the world.

Doesn't most other countries apply some type of import tax? You can't ship an iPhone from the US to India without paying almost half the cost of the iPhone (~$440), and yet all these other countries bitch when they were importing at almost no additional cost. I don't support tariff, but I do support fair trade.

I feel like they are losing the phone market (I'd say they already lost after their One series failed to innovate in parallel with Galaxy/One Plus/Pixel series). This is probably their last attempt to get back in the market. They'll certainly fail. "Blockchain" buzzword isn't going to help them

No shit. He was trying to make a joke by referencing this recent incident.
