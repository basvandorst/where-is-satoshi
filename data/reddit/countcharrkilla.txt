i just searched it up. it looks like they accepted money from some group that they helped try to take over bitcoin, but failed. they also hate segwit because it hurts some company's mining monopoly.

is robinhood using the newer addresses?

mad respect to you and your organization.  more blockspace would have reduced the incentive to switch to segwit and LN.  we wouldn't be anywhere near 35%.  in fact, we would probably be even better off right now if we had smaller blocks.  this is a long term fight people.  who cares what the price is today.
keep up the good fight!

CMC has removed things in the past from public outcry only to re-add it later.  Use another site.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:13:51
even bitcoin.com is a scam site...
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:35:52
No issue? They supported taking over bitcoin by ver, jihan, and company via s2x (which failed to launch due to a bug). These guys are fraudsters and / or idiots. What about the whole bcash nightmare on their website?
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:57:13
is this still a debate?  only thing I've heard about is people mistakenly investing in bcash when they were looking to invest in bitcoin.

you're not mining bitcoin with video cards.

how could you be so wrong about the scaling debate?  it was so clear for anyone with half a brain, yet OpenBazaar kept fighting for the other side.  surprise surprise, you've been accepting money from the one person that probably benefits the most from blocking/delaying segwit and pushing for larger blocks.  big woop, you added segwit support when it was clear it was your only option to stay relevant.

Thanks to ver and coinbase, tons of people are getting scammed by bcash daily.

someone can fork openbazaar

i've always heard that there is no benefit to purchasing organic bananas over regular.

coinbase used bitcoin to get big and then turned on us.  f them.

here's the blog post they reference in the article: 
sounds like vodafone has some skin in the game.

I was very impressed with the talk.  It is interesting that many of the major US government hearings on crypto have been very favorable towards bitcoin.

I would call it a shitcoin due to the scaminess surrounding it.

If you let them track you.

that's too bad because a lot of people were moving to gemini from coinbase.  does anyone know how the rates compare to conbase now?
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:42:05
apparently when you login to gdax (owned by coinbase) it tries to get you to trade bcash rather than bitcoin.  can anyone confirm?
