Deflationary currencies don't work.
Currency is a means to make trade of work/assets easier between parties.
If a currency is deflationary, a pie I made a sold 100 years ago is now worth a car because I chose to do nothing with it. (makes no sense and encourages people to hoard........not beneficial for the economy)
If a currency is inflationary, a pie made and sold 100 years ago is worth nothing.
My attempt to boil it down as much as possible because there are a lot of people who lack monetary policy education, and in my opinion, are making terrible bets with their finances.

Thank you the general lack of this knowledge is insane in these forums, and people need to know before they sink their life's savings on a "sure bet" because there's a limited number, deflationary nonsense.
