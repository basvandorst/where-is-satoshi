You don't need a credit card to buy bitcoin.

I don't understand, do you think you're special so you shouldn't pay taxes, that taxes shouldn't apply to bitcoin, or that there shouldn't be any taxes period? In any case I think this position is silly - a government needs funding, and I don't think you can argue that you don't need a government with a straight face.

Bitcoin is not a solution to all banking. Only a small part of it really since banks give out loans and AFAIK you can still do the whole fractional reserve banking thing with bitcoin. And I would totally use a bank that supported bitcoin - what if my small business needs extra btc?

So I put in the money using e-interac. That went smoothly. Trading however didn't: I put 50$ into the form and hit enter for it to calculate the amount in BTC. Hitting enter instead submitted the form without any confirmations and I didn't get a chance to change my bitcoin buying price. There wasn't a chance to cancel the order either.
**However** their support replied back very quickly, said they'll fix the issue in the morning and offered to buy back the coins, so all in all I'm happy. **A- Would buy from again**

I'm not an expert but it wasn't going lower earlier - looked like it was fibrillating, and now the price is higher on mtgox than I last checked. Is it rebounding some?

I was looking to buy some, I guess Ill give this site a spin.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:21:04


Well not really. Part of the value comes from being able to buy something you need with it. Like some beer. I value beer and can use btc to buy some, so I want btc, because I finished what was in your fridge.
Anyway right now there's not a lot of stuff you can buy with bitcoin, the value comes mostly from people's perception - they see it rise, and want to ride the elevator, so they buy bitcoin and the price goes up. And while that's a legitimate notion of value, perception is unsteady - someone gets sick in the elevator and vomits, now everyone wants off.

I think everyone should go to the casino when they turn 18 or whatever the legal age for gambling where you are is. Take that 40$ you made at mcdicks and try to win. You might win, keep playing and loose it all or you might loose it all right away. You will learn a valuable lesson and hopefully be smarter in the future when you have more money you should be smart with. (I'm not saying you can't go to the casino and have fun and still win a bit or a lot, but from personal experience, most young people (including myself) just didn't know when to quit.)
But maybe 7000BTC isn't much for this guy. Maybe he makes that in a week. Who knows?

I was considering buying a 7850 for gaming, I might not now if its going to have artifacts while stressed. Its usually a sign of overheating - are you overclocking your card?
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:15:32
Whaaaaaat? The whole point of confirmations is to make sure you haven't double spent. Everyone would go around getting free coffee the moment they realized you don't verify.
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:10:12
People keep saying its not worth it for small transactions but isn't it really easy to double spend coins if you know people aren't confirming the transactions? Couldn't one make an app that *always* doublespends and you would use it every time you buy coffee or take a cab to get it for free? If not why not?

If its a stand, the operator could look at his smartphone once an hour. Its not that big of a deal.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:57:24
Presumably everyone would just upgrade their clients to use quantum encryption for even more perfect security. If the majority of computers verifying transactions begin using a new client, the block-chain they build will become the longest one and hence the main one. It will be a painless upgrade.
Except I could be wrong - I think this would require using something other than a private key to make transactions and it gets difficult from there...

Doesn't "real money" in a country mean you can pay your taxes with it? Something like gasoline has a pretty consistent value, and you can trade it no problem, but its not "real money" in the legal-tender sense. That's just a thought, I have no idea how these things work and if someone could enlighten me that would be cool.

But banks do that too don't they? If you have 10$ in your account its a statement of what they owe you - its not guaranteed that they have the full some on hand. Or am I wrong?

We programmers don't even trust ourselves. We build tools, entire languages even to keep ourselves from making errors, limit the number of ways we can screw up and we still do. Even the best programmers screw up - except when they do it causes even more trouble.
MtGox went down recently - if programs were perfect that wouldn't have happend. I see your point though - I'm just offering perspective.

This reminds me of the fact that most of 4chan's posting occurs right before a GET. For the uninitiated, 4chan's posts are numbered and every million (10 and 100 million even more so) is treated as some kind of milestone.

As I see it the only difference in using bitcoin as opposed to USD is people evading taxes easier, though if you have a legitimate business or are employed I don't see this being more of an issue than how people currently evade taxes. More functional currency would just give the economy a boost if its widely adopted since you'd just have more cash flow. There's really nothing to be afraid of.

What about the mini private key? Its a lot shorter, so presumably easier to brute force - is that any more practical?

How are we defining money here? Bitcoin just transmits information, no 'legal tender' was sent right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:51:07
I'm not sure but I think it would be possible to make a bitcoin client that doublespends every time, for example sending another payment to your own address instead. Then you can just automatically never pay for coffee...

OP I suggest you remake this thread and give a proper explanation this time. Your title isn't that good either, even "Beware of fraudulent Buttercoin posts" would have been better.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:58:24
I don't get this. Bitcoin as a network has basically one job of moving around a resource without double spending. The only way to ensure this is to wait for confirmations otherwise the whole thing is pointless.
Then I hear people arguing that a few double-spent transactions don't matter if you're selling something cheap like coffee - its a few bucks lost a day. But then can't you make a wallet that doublespends *every* time you pay, so some people will keep getting your stuff for free, and probably distribute the app?
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:46:16
Start with the actual paper though! Its technical, but in my opinion very approachable. It doesn't have implementation details for the network though, I guess bitcoin-qt is the reference for that, or is there a published spec?

So you went to a website and typed in your passphrase. Then you act surprised that your money was taken, knowing full well that the only thing keeping it secure was that passphrase. 404 sympathy not found.
