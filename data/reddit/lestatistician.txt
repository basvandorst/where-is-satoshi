Kyle, I get the sense that you know what you're dealing with, and you know what Cavirtex needs to do to improve. 
+makes a lot of points that I agree with. 
**Support sucks.**
I wrote in asking about where my two verification deposits were, the response was really not helpful. You would think that rather than waiting for me to come to you, your system would notice that I'd requested these deposits, then follow up asking me to find them an verify. 
But it's not about that episode, it's about anticipating that kind of stuff. About having *someone* on the team being a full time advocate for the user.
**Outward comms**
I saw Joseph David speak at the Bitcoin Summit in Toronto in November. He asked for feedback, and someone suggested that you allow unlimited trading with a flat subscription fee. His response was that your margins are thin enough already than to allow discounted trading... I'm sure you can see why that's just not a good response. 
I also saw Joseph speak at the Bitcoin Expo. He talked a lot about **himself**, and **how much he's done for Bitcoin in Canada**. 
Also at the Expo, while having a really good conversation with an exhibitor, Joseph really abruptly cut in to introduce himself as a "fellow exhibitor" and completely disregarding me. Relationships, respect, individual interactions matter.
I simply don't trust Joseph. For all the excellent communications work I know you will do, I don't believe that you will be able to alter the internal culture. 
Cavirtex feels like a remainder from the old guard of Bitcoin exchanges. Those businesses served a purpose, and have earned a certain debt of gratitude. But that doesn't mean they've earned my continued business or loyalty. 
When I hear that you accidentally charged recently new users $50 because they didn't have any activity on their accounts in the past year, I get a good glimpse into your development practices, and a bad feeling about your security.
That said, I hope you can pull it off. 


- Fix the UI.
- Scrap your code base and buy the exchange software from a company like Buttercoin or Bex.io. That's the only way I'll trust your security.
- Leave Joseph at home.


- Ownership and management.

go to vtx.ca. Drop the CA entirely. Call it virtex.
People who know call it virtex. people who don't call it kavirtex.
