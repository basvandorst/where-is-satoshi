we should inform them about that scam
(okay, normally it should be their job to do that in the first place...)
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:55:30
on the blockchain
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:18:32
14 usd is hard.
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:09:32
Seems to be easy to do this...shame on apple.
But I am still waiting for the mtgox mobile wallet...
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:12:08
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:17:21
I can confirm: bullshit.
@_date: 2016-08-20 07:37:57
Dear robbers: Please email your "customers" and inform them about the hack. Many "customers" still have no idea they lost funds. Thx.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:05:41
@_date: 2016-08-20 07:45:13
indeed, everybody with a clear mind saw it. but alot of "smart" people lost a bunch of money there. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:25:26


wow, that is a big place. even old europe?
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:31:18
Of course it has a place :-)
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:48:17
this is actually good news ;o)
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:14:05
Easiest way is to be stupid and store tons of coins on shady exchanges + believing you get 4% interest for nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:49:13
i want my bfx coins back!1!="!
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:51:54
hopefully OB will not rely on one single server like in the past...
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:44:05
Bitfinex will go out of business and their whole marketing&amp;"security" was a joke. that is truth and the end.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:09:50
Indeed, good luck to cover 60 mios...
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:23:27
buy a hardware wallet. you learnt it now.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:42:19
actually this is good news.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:58:23
Some days ago i donated some money.
I bought a game 6 weeks ago with btc.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:37:45
dont fool yourself, alot of people will sue the shit out of bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:26:30
60mio, correct.
@_date: 2016-08-11 04:36:40
Take legal action
@_date: 2016-08-28 08:09:03
that sums it up
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:34:09
dont waste your time buddy, people are happy with the BFXtokens and continue to trade there :-) - it is too easy in cryptoland.
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:15:36
In bitfinex coins
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:31:14
hrhr, good one.
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:55:26
That is normal in german media....i guess it is the same all over the world.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:06:17
maybe they can issue some BTERTokens that we can trade?
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:05:49

@_date: 2016-08-29 14:51:50

Why do you store your coins there and not on your own device?
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:57:49
"i dont care, now i own my bitfinexCoins and i will be rich, RIIIIIIIIICH!!"!1^1"
(people, wake up. u get ripped off by these people. start acting. just a hint from someone who never lost a coin)
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:36:05

@_date: 2016-08-07 11:08:32

@_date: 2016-08-06 12:58:17
one day you can put your bitcoin in a bank account - i guess in the next 3-5 years. i see that as a good thing. i dont say, that you or i should do this but the average joe will do it.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:31:31
if you have millions of customers, your have at least hundreds of problems every day/week. that is normal.

"But if you are a lazy idiot, you store all your coins on an exchange."
(even Core devs did that on mtgox....cant believe it)
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:00:29
At least he did not stole the money this time...
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:50:01
just imagine you use *HIGH* - guess they would charge 150 USD for that.
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:54:03

And soon miners will hopefully dont know which transactions they process...
@_date: 2016-08-27 07:24:10
in some years people will be able to hold bitcoins in their bank account with an insurance. that will give the mainstream joe a better feeling.
@_date: 2016-08-26 04:54:05
I cant believe that. Bitfinex is an honest and reliable exchange and 100% secure.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:19:38
u got bitfinexed again!
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:42:12

"Excuse me to remind on one of cryptoland’s latest soap operas, it just fits perfectly to that topic: The DAO
That completely pointless strategy to collect an enormous amount of money, without any concrete need for it was not only fatally damaging their own project. That often repeated, unethical but profitable model of externalizing risks and costs to others caused immense damage to their host community: Ethereum – giving cryptoland a new soap opera episode called ETC against ETH. Too bad that the real problems are not getting solved by those excitements."

A Bitcoin Core developer was asked (and I paraphrase) “If you work voluntarily to help the Bitcoin network, who pays you? Why do you do it?” His response was “Bitcoin pays me, so I pay it back to Bitcoin with my time and effort.”

When bitcoin reached that level, it is already a big part of the existing financial network worldwide and a big part of life and then it cant be banned anymore.

It is clear that -some- miners in China are influenced by the chinese gov and business people who want to gain control over bitcoin. So it is a win-win for them. The gov gains control and the business people gain money because of their altcoin holdings. 
That could be the reason why ChinaBU is blocking progress like SW, LN and anonymity features.

@_date: 2017-02-09 08:00:13
yeah right, we have to support SegWit if we have to make a choice.

Seems like a solid idea on the one hand (SW) and a shithole on the other hand to me.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:57:39
yep, fees on the main chain are too high for those people but there will be other layers (LN) that will make it dirt cheap and where everyone can transact.
but you need a secure base layer first to reach that. if you fuck up the base layer like BU, you can forget about everything else.

i dont hate him. seeing the issues users have is nice but you should not kill the fundamental properties of bitcoin. that is called "reckless", especially if you are a long time member/hodler.

She meant, that she hasnt tested it yet.
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:49:56


the BU butt hats want to see it like that so they repeat it again and again.
lets go on and make bitcoin great again! :)

so either you win or no effect? sounds like a good deal. ill take it ;-)

not really that big if you ask me. pretty pessimistic view.

good luck with BU forking every week because they overlooked some critical bugs again.

No, because some actors around ChinaBU follow a hidden agenda. And no one said it is "enough", it will enable cool new features and it is the first step.

i havent heard someone saying yet: 
"i wont buy bitcoins because the $0.24 fee is too much for me" 
but i get your point, you want lower fees. Miners should activate SW and you will pay less fees again

and start mining :)
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:41:23
Bitcoin fast enough for me (10min), private enough, cheap (15cents), environmentally destructive (source?) and decentralised. But the last part is the most important one :)

Must be you on that rocket! wohooooooo!
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:19:00
dont tell anyone ;-)
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:15:07


they do. that narrative is easy to understand for people who dont spend hours every day on bitcoin stuff. so it is easy prey.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:08:44
you can help to push for innovation (SW)! :)
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:29:53

and they make a ton of money with it. They probably love Bitcoin :-D
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:42:58
This. Unlike some trolls with their $100 USD in Bitcoin he understands bitcoin and gives a shit if one bitcoin is at $500$, $1000 or $1500 - this is a long term game! 
if bitcoin fulfills 20% of its potential we will be out of this solar system.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:03:30
only some sock puppets and paid shills would want a change like that. but luckily 95% oppose ChinaBU.

yeah, tax miners in china! :-D
China is helping bitcoin alot, thx.

@_date: 2017-02-22 08:01:20

that would be probably the better option because if you fuck up that layer, you dont harm layer1.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:04:25
the majority is giving zero fucks because they like high fees and/or are incompetent.
Bitcoin should move forward anyway.

buddy, chill out!
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:49:10
true words, but new members possibly dont understand or dont care. if someone promises $10k tomorrow if we just add 10MB blocks and hard fork (like BU does), they will follow that logic.
it takes time to understand to valuable basics of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-02-05 10:23:56
theymos probably made some dumb decisions in the past but that is no reason to oppose SW.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:55:15
SW gives them bigger blocks. now ask yourself: why dont they accept this? 
@_date: 2017-02-25 17:30:43
there is no competition, everything has its place.
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:55:46
a good idea ;-)
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:59:18
or it might take 1-2 years before we see SW. i can wait :-)
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:46:24
why not? it could be a great investment or it could down to zero but i would make that bet.

@_date: 2017-02-19 11:36:12
do not wish that cash will be banned. you should fight against that thinking! bitcoin and cash are important to stay free from gov control.

Use mycelium and you have no problems.

@_date: 2017-02-10 09:12:08
yes, that makes absolutely no sense.

it is a side effect.

great, thx for that.

i sent 2 transactions today and used mycelium.
one with a low fee which was processed within one hour.
the second with a "normal fee" which was processed within 30min.
maybe you use the wrong software?

@_date: 2017-02-26 09:20:03
i think you are seeing it wrong:


indeed, it is. and SW makes bigger blocks. so why not add SW asap? because you have a malicious minorty (ChinaBU) who is trying to force a hard fork to fulfil its agenda, probably paid by the chinese government to do so.
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:33:10
i could name several things that i bought too - and i still would do it again. i would even buy the 10k pizza in 2011 if i could go back.

how can you say that when the first code that BU delivered made a huge mess?
and we are nowhere near a limit, bitcoin works fine. if you want more capacity, you can have well tested Segwit within some days - why not go with that? what is BUs hidden plan here?
i think your summary is flawed, sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:17:14

we should push miners so signal SW finally which will double capacity. at the moment they are happy to collect high fees.

Applicant of the first Bitcoin ETF taking steps that indicate positive SEC consideration
    The Winklevoss brothers are behind the COIN ETF application. We identify several steps they have publicly taken that might indicate progress in conversations with SEC or at least their aligned involvement as promoters:
    On Feb 19th, 2014 the Winklevoss brothers created Winkdex, an index to track Bitcoin prices that is now divulged by major financial information vendors as Bloomberg and Reuters. This could be a pre-requisite for information transparency.
   
   Since Jan 23rd, 2015 they are now operating a Bitcoin spot exchange (Gemini.com) based in New York that is fully operates under US law. It is plausible that their intention is to source liquidity for their Bitcoin ETF through their own spot exchange. This could be a pre-requisite for orderly trading, liquidity access, and capital formation.
    
    Through Gemini.com, on Sep 21st, 2016 they created a daily auction process to settle the Bitcoin price once a day. This could be a pre-requisite for fair market price fixation.
   
 On Dec 8th, 2016, the Winklevoss brothers inaugurated a website specifically for investor relationship management and promotion of the COIN ETF. Taking action to launch the ETF website after 3 years of conversations with the SEC might be indicative of a change of perception of the twins, pointing to their optimism.
    On Feb 8th, 2017, the Winklevoss brothers communicated to the SEC that they had secured the services of three of the largest high frequency trading firms to provide liquidity and efficiency to the COIN ETF: Convergex, KCG, and Virtu Financial.

he is trapped in his thinking: BU (good) - Core (bad).

@_date: 2015-01-25 18:35:58
because BTC is Gold and LTC is Silver.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:22:53
i always buy when china bans bitcoin or an exchange gets hacked. these are the best times!
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:58:46
i always buy when there is a hack or the PBoC makes some "announcement". over the years that was a pretty good strategy....or when a dev leaves bitcoin - LoL (thx Hearni)!!
(no kidding)
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:42:34

even when i disagree with the headline everyone must admit that, gavin and co were right when they started the discussion about blocksize 2 years ago.
with 2 MB blocks we wouldnt have this press and "stuck" transactions. we would have time to build out layer 2 without stress.

when someone gives you alot of money, you would say the same maybe ;-P
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:07:28
it would be dumb when they sell their own bitcoins when the price is somewhere between 1000-2000 USD.
better move: buy the coins on the market, drive the price to the moon and in "the end" you can sell your own coins for 100k each.
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:06:56
you are paid by AXA too ;-)

I think the problem isnt Litecoin, it is ChinaBU. But OP made a few good points.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:00:10


in retrospect" that was really a shithole lol...
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:03:15
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
the open source movement of bitcoin at the moment is pretty solid and the best people are working on bitcoin right now!
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:31:02

there are no real sides. there are 98% on one side and 2% on the other. the 2% side has alot of money so maybe you assume that it is more than 2%, but it isnt. you can bribe and buy alot when you own millions of dollars. when you give this 2% more attention than it should recieve, you are exposing bitcoin to alot more malicious actors in the future.
this is about gaining control. isnt it funny that some chinese guys ("the capital of free speech and democracy" ) are blocking bitcoins progress? even that fact is hilarious.

yep, dont talk about your investments. that can be dangerous. you can tell them about bitcoin but why on earth should you tell them how much you own (relates to any asset). 
90% of the people tend to tell people everything about their wealth or when they made money. for example when they win the lottery. what do they do? 
yes, they tell everyone which is a big mistake if you think more about it!
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:46:13
u are a brave bitcoin wizard too? good good :)

you have to learn more about bitcoin i guess. 


they do everything to gain more money. we dont want more power in one hand, we want less power.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:07:40
I know this is popular opinion, but now that bitcoin has reached an undeniable ATH, I'd strongly advise you to buy more like i do. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:57:48
then probably PBoC. not unlikely in my view. the chinese exchanges are still "closed"
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:43:49
i hope Commerzbank and the EU burn in hell one day.

OP, you got me bamboozled!
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:52:32
i think Litecoin will adopt it too in the future but Miners are lazy as fuck, so we need to do it in another way.
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:59:20
they are here anyway (and reading this) so yes, it would be nice to have an AMA.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:35:04
no "RIP", you can pay the fucking coffee with bitcoin when you use LN. instant, dirt cheap and secure transactions . 
SW &amp; LN are the golden goose.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:27:16
yep, thx to Roger and Jihad. But Roger bought alot alts before he started the drama, he is not regretting it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:52:32
80% are ready.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:49:54
"B-b-but Axa cooree!" 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:37:56
well, i am certain he has alot of coins and could probably buy alot more.
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:05:59
They play a good game:
- hinder exchanges to operate properly
- shut down local bitcoins 
- code a alternative client (ChinaBU) and pay miners 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:06:43
Chile unbanned bitcoin again. Now they ban blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:58:24
Pffff! Who is this guy? He is just the creator of bittorrent. 
ChinaBU has a PRESIDENT! DID U HEAR ME!? A PRESIDENT! HAIL CHINABU!
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:58:23
looks like a toddler made them
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:04:12


@_date: 2017-02-06 18:49:10
now or in the future, bitcoin etfs will happen.
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:14:51
you should do that before it is approved.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:16:22


I can only see one Bitcoin price, the other coin is called ChinaBU or BUTs (Bitcoin Unlimited Tokens)
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:13:44
running and using 0.14 is the best you can do, thx.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:54:23
poor and uneducated people will "never" be in the 1%. that is probably the answer you are searching for. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:54:49
actually r/ btc is like buttcoin these days.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:36:33
where is Bitcoin Judas in that story?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:05:53
= 99% want SegWit and no one gives a dusty fart about ChinaBU
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:30:50
great, lets add another 10k real nodes :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:55:32
of course these answers are the best:
big blocks = big money. but it is false.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:30:57
Stop the censorship from ChinaBU - support SegWit!
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:53:14
They coded Java games in the past.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:55:05
Coinbase still not SW ready but Gemini is since months - Coinbase is a shit show. what they are doing all day?
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:35:15
people would do all kind of jobs for $5/hr. in the end it is just copy/paste i guess :-)
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:42:21
they will kill BU? strange :-P
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:29:24
ChinaBU will not like that.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:43:01
fork your mother if you want to fork
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:44:31
he can´t be that stupid (i hope). But maybe after years in China, born under a dictatorship, he has lost his mind.
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:34:44
buy some Bitcoins&amp;Litecoins and put them in cold storage too.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:25:44
PBoC probably wanted that and the KYC/AML stuff for the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:43:53
There should be cats that mine Bitcoin, not humans.
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:56:42
he is still on his way to fucking outer space!
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:20:44
@_date: 2016-03-24 11:31:15
Maybe they can work on customer problems instead of fake clsssic nodes?
@_date: 2016-03-23 15:45:27
Litecoin is a backup to Bitcoin and testchain if you will (and the silver of the cryptoworld). = useful.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:55:52
Yep. It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:18:55
 ☂ - thx
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:58:25


his intention is to make more money with alts. it worked perfectly.
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:50:03


cool, welcome :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:27:53
but that will not happen in a magical way when we do nothing (dont fool yourselves). you have to stand up and fight against malicious attackers.
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:50:55
first gold. thanks true Bitcoiner ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:13:02


only "some" people ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:47:55
i will pull the trigger when the time is right.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:11:01
Princess Jihad does.
@_date: 2016-03-15 05:56:58
Never had a problem there
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:36:45
i member
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:40:59
Coinbase is a shit show. Use Gemini, Bitstamp or Kraken.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:46:43
at the moment Roger and Jihad are attacking Bitcoin. Defend it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:51:57
PLEASE DO THAT! (but i guess it is a lie anyway...)
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:20:56
i want 1 GB blocks too!
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:39:38










well spoken man. maybe at some point you cant get enough and even fuck the thing that made you filthy rich in the first place?
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:26:56
they will find another topic.
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:20:01
This! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:52:32
Gemini is pro SW. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:38:32


so there are still a bunch of luncatics and paid shills left. nothing new here. even before this shit show ChinaBU was a joke and you dont need to be an expert in coding to see that.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:07:29
IT Director Cisco - WTF?!
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:59:57
Satoshi is spinning in his chair
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:01:57


I told this countless times to some people... 
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:39:40
yeah, sounds like a good deal. everything is better than this goat shit chinaBU
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:03:50
Actually it is ChinaBU
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:05:21
Satoshi´s Banks.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:05:18
:-P - sometimes we have to look at our goals and not the problems (at least for a moment)
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:28:47
Bitcoin can have privacy, fast transactions, low fees with SW and LN (and more on top)! :)
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:51:54
at that time you can probably buy the stuff you want to buy with bitcoin. which is the point of OP.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:47:14


and when we achieved that, we can achieve Visa-scale transaction limits and alot more too. but we need a solid base!
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:46:28
yep, some chinese miners and some lunatics try a hostile takeover and stall bitcoins progress. we should fight against that.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:25:54
Olivier should program some java games.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:15:07
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, 3 untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundemental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:55:41
and dont be a fraudster :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:11:20
of course. maybe 10-20 million people own/use bitcoin - as you may know, there are more on earth. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:49:40
lol, actually it is ChinaBU which runs hundreds of fake nodes which everyone saw in the last days :-P
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:00:41
there are at least 400 fake nodes if you take a look at the "adoption rate" of the ChinaBU nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:31:11
200 rbtc sock puppets
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:04:13
it is already working. google more if you dont even know these things.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:28:04
changing the world and making money at the same time is the best i can think of.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:11:18
has nobody ever lied to you ;-) ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:27:33
I feel that too.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:33:02
the president of ChinaBU should make a statement here!
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:22:54


gaining control and split he community are the only logical reasons.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:35:48
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:04:27
A physical coin would be cool.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:01:08


hurting a little bit would be the compromise = you could run a ChinaBU node for an hour.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:25:34
here you go:
that kid likes to switch sides.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:51:28
i am happy to wait for 3k if we can fuck some malicious actors in the meantime :-)
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:33:29
dont forget "Life on Bitcoin" ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:23:54
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:57:09


and at that point you have to ask: what is your agenda Roger? going to bed with some chinese miners and try to fuck bitcoin? that will not happen.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:28:12


Freedom and privacy too. But Jihad Wu likes it that way.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:44:32
some people got bamboozled.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:40:28
ChinaBUs astroturfing machine needs more money.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:50:03
By the way, who will code ChinaBU in the future? Do you really believe the morons that do it today can do it? Because nobody will join these 3 java devs.
The world class coders are coding for BITCOIN only. It is a collaboration called Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:43:43
some people say that it is racist to say ChinaBU or ChinaCoin but in fact this attack is mainly from China (and RogerVer).
i have nothing against chinese people. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 10:06:38
damianoloan 700 bits Thx for that. Here are some free bits  :-)
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:00:07
Also interesting in the light of the ChinaBU attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:41:48
now ChinaBU will blame core for cheap fees - low income for chinese miners.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:09:59


the only conclusion.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:50:48
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, 3 untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundemental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:00:45
Why is there so much censorship on rbtc? I want a free market! President of ChinaBU, please stand up!
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:40:51
Amen - good to have u here.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:21:39
He has his own views :-P
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:49:47
always buy after an exchange got hacked - i love these times.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:16:12
when 99% of skilled devs love an improvement for bitcoin you should love it too.
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:46:02


shut up and take my bits ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:01:50
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:24:44


that could be a quote from Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:44:41
Still stoned.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:24:01


so you would follow 2 guys who manage these pools and call it bitcoin? HILARIOUS! 
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:55:43
yes, but it sucks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:48:11
they should finally rename it to ChinaBU. (PBoC Coin would be another option)
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:42:52
$1500 would come fast but Roger and Jihad have bought too many altcoins
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:26:54


@_date: 2017-03-25 16:48:11
this site looks appealing ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:07:39
thx for the link.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:07:29
Amen joecoin. 
Dont fall for any "compromises", it is an attack by ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:20:30
@_date: 2017-03-30 05:39:38


Like ISIS fighters or the Nazis too. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:56:54
we could already have bigger blocks with SegWit and LN - thanks for blocking ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:24:53
he is bribing everyone he can - sad to see.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:59:55
Jihad is playing games. Maybe he should use his time to learn how bitcoin works and what benefits he could have with SegWit and LN.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:06:48
Big blocks now -&gt; Get SegWit activated asap.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:08:31
98% of all experts are in favour of SW and LN. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 10:57:41
it is one answer and many more will follow after that.
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:09:49
yeah, please add some more facial expressions! :)
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:24:36
i dont think so ;-)
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:22:14


fuck math! free market!
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:19:24
This is easy peasy lemon squeezy.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:43:07
but no 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:38:09


Because ChinaBU is blocking SegWit. SW is an essential part for LN.
there are many people and companies working on different LN implementations. -&gt;google.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:56:08
I´ll bet that Roger will not do that in the end. Just my prediction.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:51:59
i think so too. another reason to fight against that.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:24:40
lol , this
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:12:14
Miners = 1 pool / guy in china and Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:15:32
more like Bitcoin Judas these days ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:00:44
better own both.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:52:54
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:56:46
good question...
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:51:29
the rational thinking and game theory stops when China is attacking bitcoin via the mining pools (and exchanges) -  and that is happening.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:27:52
Free country, free people, free exchanges and miners.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:39:08
Mycelium is great and Copay too! Use these wallets and be happy.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:15:49
not an unrealistic scenario. ChinaBU is trying alot to hinder bitcoins progress like LN and more privacy features.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:45:25
next bump should happen until 2019/2020 - lets see...
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:16:11
just use a proper fee and wallet :)
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:48:18
Exactly ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:45:33
Could be.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:38:25
pics? prices?
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:54:01
LN will give you alot of that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:04:19
lol - but he isnt wearing a suit!
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:29:49
Hello redditor for 7 days,
but ChinaBU is a hostile push to centralize bitcoin and is partly funded by the chinese government. we can not allow that :-)
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:42:11
they do a good job.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:18:59
rbtc is alot worse. even if all subreddits were bullshit, that has nothing to do with the actual code and bitcoin. ChinaBU is corrupt, incompetent and hilarious - they proof it again and again.
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:59:45
it is good to have a fallback system (Litecoin)
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:15:16
they should fork and start ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:56:43
because of self-interest buddy.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:31:40
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by a chinese mining pool, untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:58:21
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:41:10
XotikaTV SW ready, Coinbase "planned". I am beginning to understand why Coinbase is shitty...
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:43:10
Yep, but dont understimate the propaganda. New users can be confused by that and Roger has alot of money for that topic.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:02:15
because if they dont do it, 5 other stock exchanges will do it. if you want to be on the forefront of tech and finance, launch it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:23:50
antpool is scamming the customers - nothing new.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:29:21
I really miss the old Jeff Garzik :(
he wanted to start a space node back in the days :(
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:37:14
downvote because shitty headline.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:33:34
good old Paycoin scam, hrhr - now we have come to a new evolution of scam: Rogers ChinaBU
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:22:16


@_date: 2017-03-30 15:34:11
i agree.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:35:10
lol, he has to practise that skill more i guess.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:52:20


it would be a disaster if you deal with these people who want more power and are hindering bitcoins growth.
make the split. fork off.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:59:26
SegWit will give us that!! Wohoo , support SW!
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:47:22
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:30:36
yep, well the PBoC tells them what they have to do and of course inflation is one step.
BU's Peter Rizun is the puppet here.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:46:33
a forum without moderation would not be workable i fear. you would leave it open to the paid trolls that we all know and that would lead to bad things.
but the moderation should be relaxed and open.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:06:44
Rest in peace? are u kidding me? BURN IN HELL!!
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:52:33


you talk about "redditor since 2 days" accounts ?
as you can see on several occasions, "someone" is paying "some" people to do astroturfing. the other sub is more like buttcoin than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:02:08
10.000!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh wait, wrong currency :-/
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:44:02
bitfury is even bigger.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:55:21
that is Jihad Wu!
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:35:33
the plebs has to be poor they think. they dont want new and strong competition.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:30:23
support SegWit, then we will have a good LN with low fees for millions of users without losing the robustness of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:22:22
They get paid to write that. Of course most of the sock puppets give a shit.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:41:02
redditor for 1 month
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:49:28
i would love to have a changetip replacement :(
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:52:41


Unfortunately not. positive thinking is always good but beeing naive is dumb.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:07:44
Bribed by Ver = 0%
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:46:21
Jihad Wu will not like that :)
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:45:32
Jeff said he owns only 300 coins or so
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:26:08
some chinese exchanges would definitely list ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:54:01
i cant imagine that any real bitcoiner would use ChinaBU which violates everything bitcoin stands for.
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:51:53
i would like to have one of those :-)
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:34:36
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:56:34
100 USD "CRASH"!
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:20:57
a chinese guy writes anti-privacy articles? what a surprise :-P
of course they hate everything what will make Bitcoin more private and useful. ChinaBU is trying hard to hinder bitcoins growth.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:51:32
i would sent some bits for that if i could (RIP changetip)

sounds like LN ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:16:45
heavily regulated by math.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:27:53
should be gold
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:57:02
i heard about in 2011 in a tech magazin but did not spend time on it to study it further....arghh
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:28:35
Jihad Wu and Roger have to bribe more Devs and Users ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:23:52
Peoples Bank of China should start some more fake nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:58:32

@_date: 2017-02-27 18:49:51
good luck with ChinaBU! fork away buddy.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:43:54
of course, these statements are made by morons maybe - "more free" lol!
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:14:39
yep, and there are 2 other ETFs anyway...just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:55:17


= moderators - lol!
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:34:59
Already took option 4.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:58:46
:( - ChinaBU still blocking.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:51:13
I will use Litecoin just to be on the safe side here ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:36:38
cool, thanks for sharing! some good news.
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:59:17
for ALOT more charts ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:34:33
and now think for yourself ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:27:47
yes, nobody controls bitcoin but that does not mean that ChinaBU isnt trying :-) 
(probably paid by the chinese government to do so)
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:01:10
Maybe we have to land again to reach the moon?
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:03:33
it's really not a big deal.

Roger is working on ChinaBU meetups already.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:46:35
The President of ChinaBU approves this plan.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:06:38
only the committee is important. Jihad knows that.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:06:50
Nobody likes ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:27:29


while i doubt that they will have more hashing power, it would be meaningless anyway. you need alot more than just hashing power. 99% of the users, devs and industrie does not want software which is coded by chinese pools and gov (ChinaBU).
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:51:51


because they are paid not to "buy it". making a compromise is not possible if the other party is malicious.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:57:14
lol - and the funny thing is, i can´t even distinguish if you are trolling or a real ChinaBU shill :-D
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:59:08


@_date: 2017-03-21 09:58:57


Are you talking about Charlie Lee, the Litecoin inventor? I am following him since years and he seems to be a reasonable guy. You can only judge someone based on his actions and i can´t say something bad.
I guess he probably holds more Bitcoin than Litecoin and wants that both succeed in the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:43:07

@_date: 2017-03-04 08:00:28

probably the right thing to do for you. everyone has a different risk appetite and view on bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:25:59
Hrhr, yes it is. Things move fast in bitcoinland.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:15:58
good article and great work!
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:48:58


and at the same time, Miners and Roger block bigger blocks and LN. Blame them.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:06:53


I giggled here.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:52:11
welcome to bitcoin land. take a look at mtgox, bitfinex and all other scam companies :-)
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:34:36


Good post thx.


They follow the money from Roger and other unknown entities.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:29:30
great job Ken!
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:17:23
bitcoin runs 24/7 and gives a shit.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:17:25










hrhr, exactly. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:30:58
Probably yes, Litecoin is the google. :-P
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:12:08
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:58:33
only 2k? FUD.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:38:16


no way, i can not imagine that this is the case!
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:49:00
more like 99/1
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:31:17
That is justconspiracy theory. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:44:14
i guess he never read the snowden docs ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:42:26
Roger gives a fuck about your money. HE wants to make more money and wants more power. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:17:26
ChinaBU has found a new attack mode but i would say:
SCREW U FUCKERS!
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:57:21
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by a chinese mining pool, untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:41:26
Who? I am bamboozled right now...
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:06:29
this guy is a joke...why is this muppet always doing the public stuff? there is another CEO of this company.

@_date: 2017-03-10 13:08:56
cool, good luck buddy!
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:00:13
but ChinaBU is funded by the chinese government, at least partly. i dont like that.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:48:11
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, 3 untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundemental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:17:08
HAIL ChinaBU!
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:11:39
her old style was alot better
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:41:07


@_date: 2017-03-16 16:17:58
Thanks for pointing that out Samson. I strongly believe that most chinese people are real bitcoiners and understand the fundamental properties of bitcoin!
(but the attack at the moment is mainly from China - and Roger Ver + some unknown entities)
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:14:50
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:09:41
gold is yellow but bitcoin is not!
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:39:55
that would mean a big correction too :-P
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:07:27
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:37:58
hopefully. then he can work on ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:14:20
or rbtc which is basically the same.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:30:18
Basically ChinaBU is only pushed by a chinese mining operator (called Jihad Wu), some untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability.

@_date: 2017-03-02 16:03:46
that is a lie.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:16:50
lol - too late. Now Judas.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:21:25
This. We could already have instant and "free" transactions with LN but ChinaBU and RogerVer are blocking progress.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:51:18
Is he now the president of ChinaBU? Who is it? They want to name one i heard :-P
Hoaxtoshi would be a great leader of ChinaBU
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:11:33
in 2013 it was very different when you mentioned bitcoin somewhere. i was banned for just naming bitcoin in some forums!
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:27:08


my user experience is great. they are doing an amazing job. is that what you mean?
actually some chinese miners and RogerVer are blocking progress. bigger blocks now - with SW!
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:07:54
good to hear London is on our side ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:22:40


the amount of censorship on rrbc is unbelievable! where is the free market? why is the President of ChinaBU not making a statement here?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:33:57
But the president of ChinaBU has a different agenda than you ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:45:53


true and hilarious.
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:29:05
He should use Paycoin!
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:27:20
It seems Jihad forgot what is good for bitcoin in the last 1,5 years.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:07:55

Jihad, is that you?
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:06:00
Yep, i noticed that too. ChinaBU pays for astroturfing and they do a good job sometimes :-)
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:19:53
so that Roger could make alot money with alts.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:43:18
a good reason to support SW and LN! 
make bitcoin great again :-P !
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:48:44
"President of ChinaBU" LoL - it cant get more HILARIOUS!
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:03:15


that was a wise move :)
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:48:07
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:18:44
hopefully i can install the wallet when it is ready :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:42:49
lol! "source"....make some research buddy, you dont know a shit.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:10:17
probably. there are many theories around ChinaBU (funded by chinese government) but it is clear that they want to gain control over the network and that this is an attack to hinder bitcoins progress. China is not happy with LN and more privacy for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-31 15:49:01


I dont think Greg is naive (he is answering this shit since months) but you have to make a statement so that new members can see who is the paid troll here. It is our duty to fight against the astroturfing paid by Roger Ver and co.
(and you can learn something from nulls responses too - win/win)
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:18:58


what is different then compared to 2024, 2028...?
but i agree that was a hard attack from ChinaBU. we should make more research into POW changes just in case.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:42:22
why a hard fork (with alot of risks and planning) when we could have 2 MB right now with SegWit? that just makes no sense. 
it is an attack from some miners.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:40:54
Actually it is ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:57:50


i hopefully never see you again here :-)
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:57:17

i cant imagine that the SEC will force the Winkis to pull back their ETF just 2 days before the deadline. they are in talks with the SEC since 4 years now.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:59:28
Thanks for pointing that out coblee :-)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:18:37
now with Roger and Jihad we have the first version of that. let us use the time to make research for POW changes and things that make bitcoin more robust.

only 2 mining pools (just 2-4 guys) want to switch.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:10:59
that wont solve the problem if you deal with malicious actors. and SW is a block size increase.

Of course this would be a no brainer dude :)
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:15:16
tl;dr: the ETF will happen when bitcoin has reached $10k without the SEC and then the SEC will finally approve the ETF which will bring bitcoin to $100k.

I agree 100%
But the  censorship here is still toxic. Theymos has still too much power
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:21:55

@_date: 2017-03-29 13:40:10
gold is too inflationary, i better keep my Bitcoin ;-)
(and some Gold)
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:08:40
yeah i know there also live alot educated bitcoiners in china but the attack is mainly from china at the moment so it fits.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:12:24
i would choose Roger as the President of ChinaBU and Jihad should be the minister of propaganda.
dont forget to add a flag:
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:26:22
i would call that a malicious attack on bitcoin. there is no other way to explain it. we have to fight.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:53:57
But what does the President of ChinaBU say about that?
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:09:26
Or maybe a good chunk of them get paid to write BU propaganda (astroturfing)? Roger is paying everything and eveyone who is willing to recieve money from him. Dont be naive.

McAffe could make a ChinaBU commercial if he can show his skills here  :-P
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:17:52
lol - by accident i guess. and now we are in that mess.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:17:46
thx mattius459!
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:12:15


well, in that case we can also add 30 million coins because some malicious party likes that - even if it makes no sense, lets add it and be friends!
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:45:34
people pointed that out weeks ago. you can also look at the "adoption patterns" of the ChinaBU nodes. everything is fake.
paid sock puppets on the forums, bribed pool operators, sponsored articles...
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:01:41
possible but LN sucks in that scenario. I'm optimistic for SW. ChinaBU might delay it but it will happen.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:32:01
we will always kick the can down the road when it comes to scaling. a good problem to have.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:33:41


no, just not informed my friend.
@_date: 2017-02-11 08:52:15
Dont miss that one :-D

This. You dont need a third world country. Visit Japan.
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:49:42
So some Insiders already know about it? Crazy world! :-P
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:13:44


finally! :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:43:41
Fake ChinaBU nodes? No way, you are paid by AXA!
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:32:18
to be fair: the chinese elite told Jihad probably to do that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:29:02


it already has this support and 80% of the wallets and exchanges are ready for it. make some research buddy :) - bigger blocks NOW! I want SegWit!
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:55:55
Santander...UK bank? Not really :-P
In the long run the UK should become a good place for bitcoin (even better than today.)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:15:06
did you find Rogers diary ;-) ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:26:47
we can´t accept ChinaBU gain more control over bitcoin. sorry, that will not happen.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:44:31
the technical incompetency and switching sides of Charlie has made me lose confindece long ago. fraud is fraud Charlie - repeat with me.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:42:42
yes, cut the malicious parts off (ChinaBU).
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:03:30


HA! i will bet my 10 Litecoins against that :-P
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:25:51

I want a new house, you want add veranda to existing house. Why don't we tear down your house and build a new one _with veranda_?
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:38:13


dont waste your time with the buttcoin shit. they should add stofli as a mod - LOL!
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:57:24
if you would like bigger blocks NOW, support SW! -&gt;2MB blocks :)
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:01:19
i mean the Wikiwillis yes.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:49:53


it has no chance to succeed but it will be a wild ride.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:00:33
he seems to understand Roger Vers game.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:43:41


Sad but true. That is also the reason why they started this:
Make no mistake: at some point we have to split OR we have to take these guys out (persona non grata)
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:55:47
ChinaBU is like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:31:48


the main players support SegWit. they did a ton of work and implemented SW, they just need the start signal. See bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:08:27
ETF CONFIRMED!
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:57:05
When being questioned why the fund is only open to Chinese investors, Charlie explained that.
    “I love Chinese culture and I hope to work with Chinese investors for win-win outcomes.”
Some industrial players doubt that the truth is he doesn’t want to get involved with the US government or any legal  matters in that regard.
Also watch:
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:32:00
Who is the president of Schnorr signatures?
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:05:44
around 300-400 ChinaBU fake nodes. 
it is also obvious when you look at the past adoption of these fake ChinaBU nodes. you always see sudden jumps which are clearly launched by one entity.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:39:07
Intel and AMD - let´s join the game.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:22:58
SEC approves SolidX ETF. Why? Just to fuck with the WinkiWillis 
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:23:00
stopping OTC, hinder markets to operate, code an alternative client called ChinaBU - good plan, but bitcoin will win.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:44:28
that would lead to maybe 30 people worldwide (not even miners understand it "EXTREMELY extremely well".)
of course i dont understand the technical details very well too but at least i understand that the whole value of bitcoin comes from its censorship resistance, reliability and scarcity. that must be the top priority under all circumstances - i dont give two fucking shits about everything else ("high" fees or mass adoption tomorrow)
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:10:13
he never said that he is a cop, he is working for the state. 
and there are not many news anyway.

@_date: 2016-01-04 19:22:57
test test?!
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:06:47
i guess that is a good problem to have ;-)
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:17:38
I heard that probably 8 times in the last years :-p
Still no. 3 crypto. (Ripple is a scam.)

@_date: 2017-03-16 10:22:26
Ladies and gentlemen, stand up for the President of ChinaBU !
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:34:53

This is actually good news. *TM

thx for sharing, good points - "It is not an economic decision, it is an attack." .
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:03:59
name it ChinaBU - CBU.
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:13:34


@_date: 2017-03-03 15:56:41
ChinaBU wants to hinder bitcoins progress and the same people want control over bitcoin. they dont even want bigger blocks. why? because SegWit would give them bigger blocks asap and they try everything to block it. Clearly an attack.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:33:03
like these ChinaBU fuckers? 
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:17:49
only tell people which you wont see again or dont know who u are.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:57:13
this is why we have to think more about POW forks and other stuff. a good wake up call, thx Jihad Wu.

@_date: 2017-03-28 15:43:34


@_date: 2017-03-24 10:05:57
these are conspiracy theories - Roger Ver would never do that!
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:41:44
ChinaBU does not like the decentralized &amp; free bitcoin - what a surprise :-)
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:19:17


so $100k in 10 years? i would do it ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:31:25
time to tell Jihad and his friends from the PBoC what his job as a miner is.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:23:47
i would not call it a good thing because ChinaBU was some serious flaws, it is more an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:55:32
25k is not the "end target"
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:10:51
that is the mainstream narrative
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:41:50
dont wish for a global meltdown, you will suffer too.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:48:11

@_date: 2017-03-11 08:12:32
i was right about the size of the drop :-P
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:15:42


Coinbase is really a shit show.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:57:25
Bitmain and Roger Ver are the main reasons for this. They try to hinder bitcoins progress. We could already have LN with instant &amp; free transactions and bigger blocks too. Blame them.
We need SW asap.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:31:54
Sorry but i dont want to join ChinaBU :-) - fork off and be happy
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:49:42
I hold bitcoin because I am the LiteCoinGuy.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:56:31
$900 is the new floor - i like.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:00:01


that would be a good thing but i doubt he will do it.
they should fork away, there is no compromise if you have a malicious party at one side (ChinaBU)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:38:56
when bitcoin hits 100k in 15 years, you dont have to own alot coins.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:50:00
The President of ChinaBU wants to fork at 75%.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:00:01
;-P - i still like bitcoin extreme alot more than BU
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:06:18
PLEASE USE WIKI BEFORE WRITING YOUR ARTICLE.
and it is spelled Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:26:30
OP, you are right! Finally it is happening! Good bye all!
;-)☔ 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:06:04
Mike Maloney is a great and clever guy. watch his other videos too!
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:54:45
ChinaBU should start some more fake nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:22:48
Adopting BU in the first place is braindead to me. why do 99% of all experts say it is crap and a "mining pool expert" adopts it? makes no sense. the operators should spend more time talking to devs.
@_date: 2016-01-10 10:06:12
a summary of things would be interesting!
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:28:27
already running one. feels good man.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:03:27
Jihad is threating bitcoiners again? Nothing new.
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:26:33
10 gold reddits for starmaged.... ;-D
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:10:14
Bitcoin is always under attack. This is a (social) media attack / miner attack from Roger and his "friends". 
Bitcoin will be even stronger after that.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:46:08
Like, Best Week Ever! - for the next decades i guess ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:42:56
good points. also watch:
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:52:17
i would care.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:12:49
good point, but the main wallets and exchanges are SW ready anyway.
@_date: 2016-01-05 11:06:59
Source for download?
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:07:18
funny how some people completely destroy their (tiny) reputation forever.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:14:39
Charlie, you should open r/scamcoinseller and be the mod there :) 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:02:33
you should recieve some gold OP. the thing that drives Roger is money and power. he did some big OTC trades in alts and now he is attacking bitcoin - nice move.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:11:26
they will destroy the € for sure.
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:02:21
and thats the reason why bitcoin is only at $1200 (for now)
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:47:12
they are already trying that with ChinaBU. 
I like the UASF proposal.
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:23:56
while i agree with OP, we also have to make sure to fight back against the blatant lies from rbtc. you cant do nothing or more and more uneducated peopel fall for this ChinaBU scam
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:10:10
great post OP
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:26:44
the SEC did a great job with Madoff and the Banking and Rating industrie in 2007/2008. dont be so rude!
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:44:03


















i like this. and everyone can do what he wants. ChinaBU can mine their expensive shit and we can move on.
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:41:47
I know that lady ... :-p
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:13:46
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:47:36
The President of ChinaBU approves this plan.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:50:09
ChinaBU trolls are doing their best :-P
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:56:07


looking forward to that. looks promising.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:33:11


it is not astounding when you get paid by Roger Ver and when you give zero fucks about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:46:21
But i hear all the time from a malicious minority that we need bigger blocks right? With a hard fork and with some crazy new ChinaBU consensus system which gives this enemy even more power.
OF COURSE NOT! FUCK OFF Bitmain!
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:32:50
Proof of ChinaBU is even worse :-P
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:59:47
Bitcoin should fail any moment.
-Mike Hearn-
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:54:01
At least the president of ChinaBU should make a statement :-( !
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:56:50
This. 
(and call it what is it: an attack on bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:42:53
this time it is a social engineering attack and a attack from two pools.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:44:01
could be fake...
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:23:08
thx for that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:01:55
What could possibly go wrong if we hand over bitcoin to Roger and Jihad Wu in China?
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:30:59
Kudos Randal_M :)
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:44:06


@_date: 2017-03-26 14:34:42
i hope my friend, but 100mio (which Jihad claims) are alot of money.
i am more on Lukes side here - more research is needed to make a POW if necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:40:33
they can join on the moon - Mars is next then.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:44:04
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:35:11
the good thing is: you cant have disagreements with ChinaBU because the central gov of China tells you what do you. Jihad was born this way and he loves it i guess.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:47:43
UnfilteredGuy 700 bits Thx for that. Here are some free bits  :-)
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:27:09
it is entertaining sometimes :-P
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:00:28
bur Roger and Jihad can buy coffee again :)
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:49:03
i would agree, that is not a kitty pool.

@_date: 2016-01-19 11:06:25
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:52:54
THX for that. Covers my opinion
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:08:05


yep, they should do this. i support this idea and they can do this at any time. why havent they done it already? ChinaBU could fill a niche in the chinese market or could be used by the PBoC direcly because they already fund it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:42:11
"PBoC here: WE BAN BITCOIN! Yes, WE BAN BITCOIN!"
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:54:42

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:59:48
to the doooom!
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:49:45
exactly this.
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:45:22
a video would be nice too
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:02:57
now add: HODL!
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:56:14
ChinaBU has nearly 2 devs!
(who should code java games instead of bitcoin but okay...)
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:57:06
the price is going down because Roger bought a ton of alts via OTC and then stalled bitcoins progress. higher fees for miners, money goes into alts...win/win...(ok, no win for bitcoiners)
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:49:04
join r/dollar or r/euro and have more fun. i 100% with the post on top.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:33:12


to da moooon!
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:20:14
Now the chineses government got nervous and finally pushed Antpool to support ChinaBU- crazy times. Fork off and be happy bitches.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:16:18
ChinaBU is blocking bigger blocks, lower fees, more privacy and alot of other features. 
We should talk to the President of ChinaBU and bribe him - that could work :-) !
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:52:58
ChinaBU is comparable to goat shit.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:29:52
Roger has paid a little bit ;-) ?
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:22:42
Plan C is: FORK OFFFFF!
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:46:55
so the price target is between $238,900 and $384,472.
@_date: 2016-01-26 06:08:24
How much does it cost?
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:00:27
let´s SPORK these fuckers out!
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:59:49
China is attacking bitcoin on several levels, this is one of them.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:08:32
people on one sub are paid to hate and downvote everything. it is the new buttcoin.

If you support Bitcoin, don't use Antpool or Bitmain.

a good video about bitcoin - gj Pro7.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:18:40
Gaining more power, making money. Converting bitcoin to ChinaBU which is controlled by miners and Roger Ver, installing a ChinaBU president, obeying the chinese government.

cui bono? chinese government and some business men with altcoins (ChinaBU).
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:22:04
at least 10 dollars
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:57:12
rbtc with their ChinaBU is basically the new buttcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:14:32
Control exchanges - check
Control miners - check
Launch ChinaBU Coin - in progress

it´s called ChinaBU (CBU)
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:50:26
Actually the PBoC could be behind this attack by ChinaBU. China is doing everything they can to kill it, even when they dont say that publicly. Roger and Jihad are maybe just their puppets.


@_date: 2016-01-15 15:46:40
it is not caused by Mike - lol

(Presentation begins at 32:00)
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:20:55
no they wouldnt :)
most things that you can read there make no sense anyway. they could have bigger blocks in a few days but reject that. it is a political game from some chinese miners and Roger Ver who want more control over bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-30 05:59:23
it will run like a charm with LN
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:31:58
they could try to launch a ChinaBU ETF
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:01:37
but Roger Ver and Bitmain would love that hrhr. Now ChinaBU has to start alot more fake nodes (like in the past)
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:03:47
a story about an island. end.
@_date: 2016-03-04 06:49:40
it should be on /database
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:21:31
u start ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:44:56
maybe a bug?
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:12:29
But has the ChinaBU committee approved this plan?
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:07:40
"we are strongly against the 
coexistence of multiple blockchains that 
would result from a hard fork"
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:16:41
he is fighting idiocy (ChinaBU) with humor - i like him :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:56:06
and they fix problems that core does not even know. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:09:52
bitcoin can have an ETF in London, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore...it just takes time.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:28:06
thx Mani ;-)

no HODL?!
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:08:30
just sent it with a proper fee you morons.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:12:35
wow, good summary my friend.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:14:16
even if one ETF is denied, one will arrive. Satoshi predicted that.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:31:36
Can you ask him, since when he is a hodler?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:49:50
99% vs 1%
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:46:56
and forcing miners/users to adopt ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:57:42
make some research if you are interested in that :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:35:33
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:53:49
isnt it possible to add the wallet.dat in a ChinaBU client, then sent the ChinaBU Coins to an exchange and trade the ChinaBU Coins for bitcoin?
(after that, transfer the original Bitcoins to a new wallet. of course it is possible that the ChinaBU client may steal all coins or spies on your pc...)
can someone explain? i have to get rid of this shit asap.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:57:12






Make no mistake bitcoiners. Be aware.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:23:34
LN is ready. Adopt SW and we can start.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:03:55
that sounds like a plan ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:26:19
Jeff Garzik wanted to sent one into orbit (canceled that later) - would be cool if we could reach that in the next years!
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:46:37


the subreddit was bought by Roger, most nodes are fake which everyone saw in the last days and they bribed 1-2 pools (not individual miners.). t's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:45:08
If they are paid by a malicious organisation or state (which is the case with ChinaBU), yes. they dont care. it is an attack sponsored by China.
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:10:12

good to have u here nopara73 :-)
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:23:48
or ChinaBU (the people who fund this hostile attack have a right to be named)
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:51:30
only 1 pool, only 1 guy in china.

@_date: 2017-03-18 08:57:49
the silent majority finally found its voice.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:56:26


LoL - I can guarantee you that no sane dev will work for ChinaBU which was forced by 2 chinese pools, chinese gov and RogerVer.
that would be the opposite of the Cypherpunks  movement.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:21:35
what will happen in 2020? a reward halving yes, and?!
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:26:56
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:09:07
10k in the next 5-10 years. yes, but where is the news buddy? some people know that :)
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:23:35
you should post that in the other sub i guess. we already know this :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:16:45
so some chinese miners are paid to join ChinaBU which is actually an attack from the miners. another reminder why we need to keep bitcoin as decentralized as possible. fuck these miners! what do they think who is coding all this stuff?! good luck with ChinaCoin
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:44:05
You are Bitcoin Moses.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:05:08
Even if they finally name it ChinaBU, i will hate it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:30:45
who should buy this ChinaBU crap anyway?
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:35:59
JihadWu is fighting his holy war of insanity.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:25:26
stay focused and fight against the attacks we face (ChinaBU) and will face in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:04:20
i can confirm, pump incoming ;-P
But i am 95% BitcoinGuy to i would like to have SW in bitcoin asap too.

i support that part.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:09:18
I member.
@_date: 2016-03-26 20:54:12
dont worry, they still have plenty of VOX currency.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:07:14
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:53:22
a few years ago i felt like this was correct but it got alot better (in my view).
and on the other side: the is no miner communication.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:35:38
yep, just the codes matters.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:33:18
he was a politician.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:38:32
it would be the end. we have enough shit fiat currency in the world.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:41:37
Gemini is pro SW - see bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-02-18 07:18:47
as a long time hodler i can tell you:
the chance for a bitcoin ETF is 99,99% in the next 3-5 years.
have fun.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:14:37
thinking the PBoC is only attacking exchanges and is doing nothing against miners is naive.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:27:49
ChinaBU has meetings with the chinese government. Maybe we can attend one of these meetings? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:59:43
Should be less than 1% in my view. Antpool and Bitmain a clearly attacking bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:00:58
I feel like this is a fact most people dont see. Everyone is talking about hashrate, miners and exchanges. 
What do you do with ChinaBU when no Wizard gives a dusty fart? Who do you think will code and secure that Shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:23:41
gold OP, gold.
Roger now tries to install these Onecoin/ChinaBU meetings. He probably will not stop but hopefully just create his own coin someday.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:59:13
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, 3 untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundemental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:50:39
ChinaBU should fork and make their own thing, even if we have a little pressure on the price in the short term.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:42:14
Blame Miners and Roger for blocking progeress.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:26:57
i wait until it is official and has more review but nice to see progress.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:58:36
$0? better sell today!
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:44:40
And you would not even need many people. I guess 10-20 people using multiple accounts would be enough + some noobs who adapt the narrative.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:22:19

@_date: 2017-03-31 16:24:12


to have a good laugh yes :-)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:44:04

unfortunately not. what is the new trick xcsler :-) ?
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:31:26
i did not see a parabolic rise yet. maybe when we hit 5000 USD or so...and crash to 1800 USD after that.
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:14:32
i guess the SEC guys bought alot of coins and now are dancing all day long.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:26:20
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by a chinese mining operator (called Jihad Wu), some untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability.

@_date: 2017-03-18 08:21:24


That could be the case. Chinese gov is harassing bitcoin exchanges since years - THEY HATE BITCOIN! Does anybody really believe, that they wouldnt reach out to miners to hinder bitcoins success?!?
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:18:21
He is the president of Bitcoin   (foundation...the old one)
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:45:53
i will sell all my ChinaBU Coins as fast as possible....but before that, i will sent them over and over again to myself just for fun.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:46:50
finally someone is doing that! :) thx
at the moment it isnt that user friendly in my view but everything has to start somewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:58:41
Loaded could make a statement. What did Roger write in his mail?
But Roger would never trade his ChinaBU Coins anyway lol
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:08:20
Talk to your CTO - he will teach you more about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:22:34
yep, and we should support him.
and in addition to that, mindful readers can learn stuff by reading gregs answers :-P

@_date: 2017-03-23 08:53:39
you have to be a "libertarian" to say one thing and do the other ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:43:38
That pretty much sums it up. We can make this phantasy story even better: After ChinaBU took over, all Core Devs will join the two ChinaBU Devs and learn from them how to code.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:58:06
SW is the compromise. take it or leave it.
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:19:11
use Gemini or Kraken.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:43:27
"from the ashes of centralization" back to ChinaBU - lol
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:16:48
i should change my Coinbase password tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:43:37
so Twitter already enabled SegTwit and Jihad and Roger still blocking SegWit.
Twitter to da moon and we have to stay in earth? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:35:17
(bribed) chinese miners are still a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:24:15

@_date: 2017-03-19 17:44:23

just use a wallet which calculates the fees and have fun. why is that so hard?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:07:57
and they got away with this - lol
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:42:53
you can bet on it ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:40:15
i guess if you would really step back as a real bitcoiner and Roger can do what he wants, he will certainly have alot more bad influence in the future.
dont be lazy, fight against the enemies of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:54:31

lol, OP nailed it.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:23:51
in 15-20years maybe.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:46:29

Timbo925 700 bits Thx for that. Here are some free bits :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:46:33


but ChinaBU has an easy message: "$10k tomorrow! Bigger blocks! Power to the miners!!"
but most times the easy answers are wrong. Roger is trying to give easy answers to a complicated problem to gain more power. it is a social engineering attack.
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:50:49
Power is very addictive. He would never do this.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:34:49
Bitcoin Judas is buying all the altcoins at the moment. he made some larger otc trades...
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:11:25
hrhr, i thought about the same in the last weeks. it could happen that we see a massive load of new features after we eventually adopt SW.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:10:22
No one is attacking  trust me, i am Charlie!
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:10:37
then you leave the playing field to the astroturfers paid by ChinaBU and Roger Ver :-(
@_date: 2017-03-30 05:47:07
i came to that conclusion too.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:55:09
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by two chinese pools/guys, 3 untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). ChinaBU destroys the fundemental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability.

@_date: 2016-01-12 15:28:35
finally. theymos found his backbone.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:18:20
In case that the 100 ChinaBU nodes will survive :-P
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:24:36
Antpool switched to ChinaBU because the President of ChinaBU told them to do that (communists dont like back talk you know?).
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:37:30
you can have everything at the same time buddy.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:20:57
Many bitcoin businesses, not just BitPay, are paying a ton in tx fees because SegWit activation is being blocked.
@_date: 2017-02-11 08:41:31
Bitcoin can take 1% of alot of markets (gold, silver, forex, remittance). It does not need to take 20% of a single market to become really big.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:10:33

to write that in the light of the snowden docs is pathetic.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:46:58
i would pay to see that :-P
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:23:47
Jihad is just doing what the PBoC is telling him.
Maybe Roger is the bigger problem here.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:21:19
good point OP, thx.
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:42:44
i need more gov backing.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:43:42
The president of ChinaBU has to step down!
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:22:16
Install a proper wallet like Mycelium. Sent transaction. Done.
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:26:33
Most people want 2 mb blocks - nobody cares
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:10:16

@_date: 2017-03-26 19:13:30
good to see some sane minds. good luck with the project.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:52:13
"but it is too expensive to buy coffee!" *Roger Ver after he bought a ton of alts*
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:12:42
plus bigger blocks (1,7)! So finally everyone should be happy ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:00:50
SegWit is a good compromise. Lets make bigger blocks with that! I have no time for the president of ChinaBU lol...
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:08:26
60 minute version missing.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:13:52
because AXA....
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:47:22


SegWit is a block size increase to 2 MB, you dont need a hard fork do reach that! why is that so hard to understand? not adopting SegWit is a political move, an attack to stall bitcoins progress..
you can only make a compromise if the other party has no malicious plans but that is not the case with ChinaBU. ChinaBU wants to gain control over bitcoin and we can not allow that.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:20:31
thanks for all the hard work WinkiWillis! dont stop, bitcoin gives a fuck and u should too!
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:37:57
exactly but funny that some people cant see it. you have to be the digital gold first to build everything else on top of it. you cant build a crappy baselayer and make some useful stuff out of it (or just use Paypal)
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:17:13
i would be happy with "in 6 months" but i will be rather 12 months.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:44:50
Hrhr, good to hear true words from a Wizard like him. 
Jihad is doing everything to gain power, that should be clear.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:43:59
Jihad or Roger can dictate too.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:12:44
Damn, only the President of ChinaBU can help us now!
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:50:54
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:15:08
dont forget ChinaBU fake nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:21:00


Exactly that. ChinaBU is a social engineering attack and we already have alot of poofs that people are paid to post false informations, accusations and miners get bribed to favour buggy software.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:24:35

WoW, no more major bugs! these guys have turned from java devs into true wizards!
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:48:08


not really. they are promoting to attack and split bitcoin my friend.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:31:44
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:39:36
The President of ChinaBU should make a press conference. I want justice!
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:41:33
Of course he is unbanned again because that is not a free and equal place
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:36:59
i would not use that service.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:42:59


@_date: 2017-03-11 08:34:37
tl;dr: the ETF will happen when bitcoin has reached $10k without the SEC and then the SEC will finally approve the ETF which will bring bitcoin to $100k.
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:37:14
Unfortunately i had that feeling too since couple of months. He can´t live with SegWit as a compromise and it doesnt matter which technical arguments you bring up. ChinaBU should fork off and do their own thing. Maybe that is their business plan?
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:18:24
at the moment it is not immun against malicious actors like Bitmain and some business man who have no clue about coding and networks...we have to make it immun again.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:32:08


ask Roger Ver how high his moral on that topic is... (hint: $$$)
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:08:23
the missing 7th rule is: 
Miners must adopt ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:39:22
Mike Hearn was right all the time.
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:18:35
the ChinaBU guys should code java games instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:32:13


cant agree more. do it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:05:00
we should do this crazy LN stuff...
good news: almost ready but SegWit first :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:53:50
i call it ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:50:23


qui bono?
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:11:29


that is actually good news :-P
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:21:01
just imagine they had great arguments and writing skills.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:47:35
alot millions ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:59:11
They are building ChinaBU :)
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:54:20
the chinese committee has to decide! that is how it works. *Jihad Wu*
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:45:59
100% approval! 
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:35:46
the President of ChinaBU should make a statement.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:29:08
Did he ever meet Roger "Judas" Ver?
Why have so few chinese miners a clue about SW and LN? What can we do to improve that and protect the chinese members from ChinaBU propaganda and astroturfing?
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:48:33
fuck miners. they are not the only ones who will decide that. miners cant take the whole ecosystem as a hostage. they have to serve bitcoin and not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:53:47


@_date: 2017-03-09 14:55:24
chinese government is trying hard to push ChinaBU - that is an attack.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:17:11
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:15:54
AXA told you to say this :-P
(seriously: you summed it up pretty good)
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:02:39
Many people dont think about that. 99% of the world class bitcoin devs give a shit about BU and would rather hang themselves than work for it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:36:07


@_date: 2017-03-28 10:07:15


@_date: 2017-03-01 17:20:58
ChinaBU wants to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:37:46
ChinaBUs President says we must adopt ChinaBU! You have to obey Jihad Wu! That is all what bitcoin is about - controlled by 3 guys in china and japan.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:57:25
MATT MILLER IS BAAAACK!
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:38:25
also take a look here:
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:29:24
Jihad Wu is the biggest of all.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:17:29
this chart looks like natural adoption of nodes. the nodes operators must be in contact 24/7...best friends!
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:39:08
Roger knows probably too, but he makes alot of money with this tactic.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:57:07
Sotashi is the president of bitcoin and i am the president of Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:05:20
HAIL JIHAD! HAIL ROGER!
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:54:51


when they dont hold bitcoins and only alts, they give a shit. probably Rogers game too at the moment.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:41:14
haha, funny story :-D
i guess in some months you will laugh about that.
start at youtube bitcoin 101
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:12:54


lol, ChinaBU did this several times already. maybe there are 100 real ChinaBUs nodes in the world (maybe) but not more. their tactics and lies are pathetic.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:10:46
July 4´s - that is bitcoins Independence Day!
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:11:02
It is what it is: an attack from some chinese miners. Probably partly funded by chinese government. We had always expected that to happen at some point.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:00:04


Or you stay here and fight against the hostile ChinaBU attack &amp; for a free bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:44:19
should be sticky there.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:35:27

Willkommen hier ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:06:51


This. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:43:12
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by some chinese mining operators (mainly Jihad Wu), some untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:02:20
Hoaxtoshi is back!!!!! (and he is NOT Satoshi!)
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:39:40


They are paid, at least some of them.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:57:38
it is a duty of every bitcoiner to point out astroturfing and the propaganda from ChinaBU. did u ever visit the other sub?! the arguments and accusations are hilarious.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:33:53


and dont agree on anything that 99% of the tech. experts recommend = ChinaBU
naive is to believe that some people want only the best for bitcoin, they want the BEST FOR THEMSELVES (Roger, Jihad and so on).
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:23:06
kudos ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:52:28


(i am the blue guy)
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:29:25


this is a false assumption. why?
 DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:57:01
would make sense, yes.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:24:25
take a look at some silicon valley multi millionaires ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:06:30
Governments should buy all bitcoin and protect us from evil. I would approve that plan.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:14:40
if we estimate there are 15-20 million BTC users in the world and we have a price of $1100 - that would make $11000 when we hit 200 million users.
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:39:40
astroturfing and buttcoiners.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:43:50
after he was paid probably? the amount of excuses and the way he said it is suspicious to me. and even without his statement it is clear that some people are just trolls (or paid shills).
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:19:28
Charlie, I think you could be onto something here
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:25:28
while this is true, there are only a few good devs, alot investors and millions of users. so which of these groups are the most valuable?
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:59:54
hopefully. we need that split.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:26:01
true, you cant even follow all the news these days.

"Miners must double check to make sure all the mining nodes and backup nodes have been upgraded.

sorry, i got bamboozled.
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:54:30
Ver and Bitmain could bribe Coinbase to list ChinaBU instead of bitcoin. That would be an option :-)
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:34:53
you can only think what they think if you bribe them. (thx Winkis!)

@_date: 2017-03-06 07:20:58
you can stop bitcoin if the community adopts ChinaBU which only runs in datacenters or if we give too much control to (chinese) miners. 
always keep in mind why bitcoin is worth something and which are fundamental properties of it.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:30:23

To use LN the hubs have to lock in some bitcoins so that others can use this LN route right? isnt that a positive fact for the price aswell? because there will be a massive amount of "locked" funds which limits the amount of available bitcoin.

That is a logical conclusion. The chinese gov wants to hinder/destroy bitcoin (no surprise here). It is a social engineering attack by these people to split bitcoin and launch ChinaBU. Meanwhile they also attack the exchanges.

“In this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb,” she said. “I’m astounded the mining industry are running this software. But since they are, and a lot of people could get harmed, the best I can do, other than recommending they don’t use Bitcoin Unlimited, is to disclose the issues and hope they are competent enough to fix it.”

"Yes the attacker is on the move again right now. He donated some ether into the DAO and joined both whitehat splits. We drained the ETH he donated as fast as we could but he got what he wanted.
An attacker in now part of both splits and he can now do the split attack again in both white hat DAOs. This is why we need a soft fork. I will publish a blog post very soon with the steps forward from now on."

"investing in bitcoins since it's early years"
and still asking this question? this is strange. do more research and dont look at the price all the time. 400 - 500 - 600 - that is fun but meaningless.

reminds me of a story in 2013: i started some topics in big forums (not bitcoin forums) and just wanted to talk about bitcoin (i did not tell anyone to buy it, just wanted to discuss the topic). 
and every time i did that, my thread was locked some days/weeks after i had opened it ("ponzi" etc...)
(bitcoin was trading at 80 USD back then)
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:32:11

and BU just wants to bump to 2MB or 4 MB with a problematic hardfork right? that would be even worse and BU has no good features either. SW delivers much more clever things than BU and SW dont hurts decentralization.

Amen brother. Now would be a good time to start using bits like most of the people already use.
1 bitcoin = 1.000.000 bits

true but at some point, the base layer of bitcoin will be unchangeable (and that is a good thing)
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:11:25
the problem is not just about an increase in the blocksize. if you add bigger blocks, you add other attack vectors too. (google)
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:38:09
there will be enough opportunities for these folks in 2017 if they want to sell (i would not)
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:36:05

Berkshire Hathaway never made a split and now one single share is worth so much. many people dont know about this. if google never made a split it would be similar.

True, that will happen and most people will use that. i dont think it is a good thing but most people are already using exchanges as their banks.

Even if you bought in at $1200, in ten years it will more than likely seem wise.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:04:41
"I believe" is the problem here.
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:26:52
CHINA BANS BITCOIN!
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:52:47
try bitstamp, kraken or safello
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:12:24
buy a hardware wallet if you own a larger amount.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:33:09
This. Thx.
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:45:21
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:58:05
nice, thx for sharing
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:07:56
be careful.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:46:28
They play the Blockchain game but maybe this is a good start to bring bitcoin to the people ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:42:36
2014 - i member.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:45:17
now i would use their app!
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:34:23
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:08:29
They should use joystream.co
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:25:59
still waiting for that :-) 
i know Jeff wanted to do something like that but unfortunately he canceld his plan. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:05:35
the mainstream media and print will report about that in a few days or weeks. they are slow. and their "2 minute infomational shit clips" will be superficial as always.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:20:23


calm down buddy, i promise that wont happen. bitcoin works fine.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:41:30
Classic Roger Ver move.
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:20:00
i donate bitcoin regularly - thanks for the links :-)
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:47:22


i guess that comes with experience. iam following markets since decades (made mistakes too) but many years of learning and watching you also learn how to play the game.
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:30:52
like never ;-P
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:10:24
not yet
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:48:03


@_date: 2017-01-06 10:56:23
watching since 2013 and never buy anything? i cant imagine that...
anyway: welcome ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:21:56


?! 
that is not true.
hello redditor for 10 days :-P
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:45:13
and i guess all his life savings are in bitcoin since 2011 - good work Rick ;-)
(edit: ok, he did not do it in 2011 ;-D)
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:26:43


some devs are doing this since 1 year at least.
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:50:30
this dude nails it. thanks!

@_date: 2017-01-10 12:16:05
just for fun, i would do it :)
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:56:01
that coindesk is asking for donations is hilarious.

very trustworthy police i guess.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:07:01
I dont want to see Shiterium 2.0 so no, we dont want unnecessary hard forks. Bigger blocks can be accomplished in many ways.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:16:04
300k blocks NOW!
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:04:06
when bitcoin comes down 30% again, you feel right again (but u are wrong again)
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:49:32


@_date: 2017-03-24 16:34:31
thx for blocking progress Jihad Wu
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:49:11
that is a good thing :) (because u are early)
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:53:23
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:22:40
buy and hold bitcoin (and litecoin). end.
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:38:28
the brightest minds are working on Core and we should be thankful.
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:46:40
code is closed source. Hmmmm...
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:14:24
depends on the future valuation: i could imagine a bitcoin price of 40k - 100k in 15-20 years.
now ask yourself: do YOU own "enough" ?
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:00:21
Coinbase needs bigger blocks ASAP!
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:44:17
welcome boy.
@_date: 2016-11-05 08:00:02
nov2013 is nothing, we are not even close to an exponential growth curve.
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:46:17
I disagree with trying to work out a resolution as if this is a political process. It is not - either you hold strong on defending Bitcoin from centralized control or Bitcoin becomes another historic relic of an e-Money that failed.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:30:51
Coinbase -&gt; Install big blocks now!
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:19:35
some bitcoin action, thx :-P
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:27:42
SegWit 101:
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:31:05
yes but that is not an argument to give even more (potential) power to Intel :-)
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:18:58
well said.

i always buy when china bans bitcoin, an exchange get hacked or Mike Hearn quits again.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:33:22
that is not for a newbie, more for a semi-noob :-P

Do it OP and when u move your funds, dont move all at once, split!
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:55:41
the thing what takes bitcoin to the moon is: time.
@_date: 2016-06-09 05:58:01

for a bitcoin etf? 99%.
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:02:09


yeah, they only added some broken code :-P
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:21:54
now launch a canadian Bitcoin ETF asap! ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:53:56

@_date: 2017-01-22 09:06:59
dont forget the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:34:48
it is obvious that they use their tool to spread misinformation. that tool is a political one which gives users the easiest answer to their problem.
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:18:20
hopefully this is the legit website. last year there was a scam site :-(
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:46:19
these channels recieve 8 billion (!) Euros every year :-x - and you can hardly find any quality there.
but this time we were lucky and got our 6 min bitcoin review ;-P
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:01:54


good questions, i dont know what he is trying. i can see nothing good.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:34:14
Kraken.com, Bitstamp, Safello....
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:11:29


i would sign that.
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:39:10


and freedom. but fuck that! first they take your fiat, then they ban gold and then...good luck. dont give up your freedom so easily. bitcoin wont help you there. fight for your right to choose which ever medium of exchange u want to use!
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:17:18
bitcoin banks - cool, i predicted that some years ago :-)
(like some others too of course)

buy 100.000 bits for 90 USD, easy :)
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:33:08
your way leads to centralization. good luck when large cooperations or countries start to attack bitcoin... 
bitcoin has to be as resilient as possible. if the baselayer is not resilient, bitcoin will be worthless. simple as that.
you can build a second layer on bitcoin which does alot of funky stuff and then you can buy coffee with bitcoin again.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:26:15
but one useful tool more :)
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:20:09

They were anti-HF for a long time, then they took money from Bitmain and now suddenly they're some of the biggest HF proponents in the space. Let that sink in.
Steven Pair is a bought puppet. No integrity and principles whatsoever. That's why I keep saying we shouldn't let the industry dictate what Bitcoin is: these "captains of industry" only care about lining their pockets, most of them don't give a rat's ass about Bitcoin itself.

Only until they get hacked.
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:57:19
i should buy some Litecoins.....oh wait ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:39:54
AXA should build bigger blocks :-P ? 
All my transactions are instant, no problem here, especially when you only buy stuff which is worth under 20 USD in a shop.
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:30:10
but it sounds like a big change...
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:10:49
u are doing everything right mr. now do some more research and make your own decision:  buy more or leave this tech.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:32:10
Mark Karpeles had a key too by the way ;-P
@_date: 2017-01-15 10:20:39
good experience so far but i just made 3 transactions :)
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:30:49

this argument is so dumb....... i love it! Make bitcoin great again!
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:07:45
throughput increase - yep, that is a better and healthier way to look at it!
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:26:22
So generous.
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:12:24


I'm afraid he's really digging his own grave here...
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:38:37


and still transactions/day are rising. maybe people dont care if they have to pay 20 cents for a worldwide and censorship resistant transaction ;-) ?
be patient my friend and do some research.

@_date: 2016-12-31 12:24:49

@_date: 2017-01-28 07:10:09
believe me, it was bloody hard to use it in 2012/2013. now you can just download an app and start. making bitcoin like an apple product is not an important thing to do at the moment.
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:49:33
where can i buy it :) ?
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:58:37
Coinbase is still ok. Bitstamp, Kraken, Circle are good too.
@_date: 2016-12-16 09:48:50
i never understand what he is saying but he reminds me of Buddha so i agree with everything.
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:59:58

@_date: 2017-01-04 22:14:02
No, they just did not pay a normal fee.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:10:20
i do. and some south american countries try the same (and will fail)
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:56:30
and let VIABTC pay for it!
@_date: 2016-12-15 07:14:56
the world is easy to understand :-P
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:46:34
one of the best techincal analysis i have seen in a long time!
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:48:16
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:05:59
and VIABTC will pay for it!
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:12:03
some more infos would be great
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:44:33
i just made a transaction and paid 10 cents.
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:54:20
and bitsquare.io
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:03:41
this :) 
(&amp; the price is nice too)
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:57:36
in some years people will be able to sent half a cent for free and will be happy again - but people are impatient by nature.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:03:30
Bitcoin is not about shopping in the first world. It's about everything else, everywhere else
(but you will be able to use it for shopping in the future if you like, with your instant and nearly free transactions :) )
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:47:35
yeah but....it is really that great! :-)
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:11:01
That's (depending on the miners they use and if my calculations are correct) ~150PH, or about 15-17% of world's hash power.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:12:00
great. good work ken!
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:24:46
good deal.
@_date: 2016-11-07 09:26:25
"If a government limiting bitcoin scares you, get out. We’re going to see hostility toward bitcoin from many governments in the future and if this causes you to panic, I have no clue why you’re a part of this community. Also, if your main source of news is ZH, consider how many times they’ve been wrong in the past and also get out of the bitcoin community."
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:49:49
that is another good reason.
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:46:02
add a /s here  ;-)
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:29:44
yep, with that logic the internet wouldnt have intrinsic value too. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:06:26
"Blockchain" ?!
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:02:22
Google "Bitsquare"
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:55:48
what language is this?!
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:58:41
because mint-chip (from a first world country) was such a bug success.

@_date: 2016-11-13 09:17:24
Goldman Sachs and their friends fucked the whole world in 2008 with their risky "products" and scams (and regulators played their part).
compared to that, i see bitcoin as a secure and legitimate market instrument which should be available via an ETF.

@_date: 2016-12-25 11:21:41
and 4 billion have less than 5 dollars each month :-P
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:12:07

i know that feeling dude.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:22:57


are u kidding me? these people are probably the biggest (early) investors. that is the reason why they act so carefully - and we should thankful for that!
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:58:30
1. u are not late
2. i read about it in a tech magazin in 2011/2012...but did not do my research...argh
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:53:19
we will wait another year :)
@_date: 2016-11-30 18:06:47
yeah...because terrorists use cash...who could be against that?!
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:01:59

This company just sucks.

@_date: 2016-12-18 09:37:42
the venezuelan people should start accepting/spending bitcoin directly...that would be a major force.

Steven Pair is a bought puppet. No integrity and principles whatsoever. That's why I keep saying we shouldn't let the industry dictate what Bitcoin is: these "captains of industry" only care about lining their pockets, most of them don't give a rat's ass about Bitcoin itself.

the service is okay but you have to deal with other traders when you buy and sell, it is not "a real exchange".
the monthly limits for buying/selling are not good either.
personally i would recommend Bitstamp, Kraken or Safello if you want to buy more and hassle free.
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:33:11

i cant judge about the content of your slides (didnt read it) but i would say that your slides contain way too much text. a slide should only contain important informations and catchword/maybe 1 sentence.
anyway: your are doing god´s work :-P
@_date: 2016-12-24 17:37:50
just tell them something from time to time. over the years, they will think that bitcoin is a normal thing and probably make their own research.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:19:40
the reason is difficult to understand when u are new to bitcoin.
the easierst way is, just use a proper wallet like MyCelium or Copay and enjoy bitcoin. 
Longern version:
The scaling roadmap says "the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is unbounded". But we can't scale bitcoin in an unbounded way without serious trade-offs.
We would all love for the network to process thousands of transactions per second without any trade-offs, but at present, that is not possible. Simply increasing blocksize creates a problem known as "cost externalizing", which is is a term describing how one party maximizes its profits by off-loading indirect costs and forcing negative effects to a third party. If the block size is increased, the party that maximizes its profits are the people creating transactions because with a higher block size they don't have to pay as much in fees, and the third party having their costs increased are those running full nodes. If those costs increase, the number of nodes will drop, causing the network to be insecure.
Also, the economics of the bitcoin system require that a fee market develop over time as the block subsidy decreases. Without a fee market, there would be no incentive to mine and secure the network.
Bitcoin will scale on other layers with a strong fundament, dont worry my young friend :-)
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:33:48
Newsweek will do a Special Report just on that ;-P
then we will have to teach them: 1 Bitcoin = 1.000.000 bits

@_date: 2016-12-04 17:05:14
people love this ;-P
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:35:53
for most people that is probably true. and i guess most people already hold their coins on exchanges and more and more will do that in the future. exchanges will be the modern banks.
but if you are tech savy enough, i would not recommend it.

&lt;&lt;While we can’t predict how much demand there will be for a bitcoin ETF, and while it’s 
unlikely  to  be  as  large  as  that  for  the  GLD,  we  still  think  it  a  will  be  problem
atic  for  the 
bitcoin markets, in that it
could create demand that is 
an order of magnitude greater than 
what could currently be sourced without moving the market. 
Such  sizeable  demand  could
cause  a  severe  price
spike  akin  to  that  in  November  2013, 
which could
lead to headline risk for all players involved in the issuance o
f a bitcoin ETF.  It could also kick start a positively reinforcing bubble in the bitcoin markets, where the higher 
bitcoin’s  price  spikes,  the  more  speculative  demand  would  grow
.  &gt;&gt;
launch it.

@_date: 2016-11-25 08:51:48
use copay or mycelium

that would be hard to do :-P
i found some infos:
There are sort of three levels of pooled mining disincentivization.
    (Bitcoin) No disincentives. Incentivize pooled mining through limiting variance of rewards.
    (2P-PoW) Some disincentives. Allow some pooled mining, but make it difficult to create unnecessarily large pools.
    (Sign to Mine) Completely disincentivized.
The middle ground, 2P-PoW, would be great if we could (in a decentralized way) determine how much pooled mining is going on. While it would be nice to be somewhere in the middle, the only complete solutions that exist are polarized. Either pool mining is completely allowed (Bitcoin), or it is mostly eliminated (Sign to Mine).

Bitcoin has moved one step closer to mainstream credibility after the world’s largest futures exchange operator launched a pair of indexes designed to track the virtual currency’s price.
The gauges from CME Group Inc. could be used as building blocks for futures contracts that would make it easier for both professional and individual investors to trade bitcoin.
The new CME indexes “are clearly precursors to a listing of some kind” of futures contract, said Daniel Masters, chief investment officer at Global Advisors (Jersey) Ltd., which manages $25 million in bitcoin assets. “There is tremendous pent-up demand in the U.S. for bitcoin exposure that doesn’t require an investor to select one of the current bitcoin exchanges in order to invest.”
Trading the virtual currency can be logistically tricky. Since U.S. brokerages generally don’t offer a way to trade it, people who want to buy or sell it need to set up accounts directly with a bitcoin exchange. There are dozens of such exchanges around the world, many of them small and lightly regulated. But if major players such as CME launch exchange-traded funds or futures tied to bitcoin, investing in the digital currency would become similar to trading stocks or commodities.
By entering the bitcoin space, CME is associating itself with a virtual currency with a questionable past. Bitcoin has been linked to criminal enterprises such as Silk Road, the online drug bazaar shut down by the FBI in 2013. It is also notoriously volatile, with the price of a single coin jumping from $552.82 in August to about $700 today, according to CoinDesk.
CME could be risking its reputation by teaming up with the murky overseas bitcoin exchanges where prices are set, said Mark T. Williams, a lecturer at Boston University and critic of the digital currency.
“Bitcoin pricing is still in the Wild West stage with unregulated bucket shops influencing daily price discovery,” Mr. Williams said.

    Winklevoss Brothers Choose State Street to Help Launch Bitcoin ETF
    Chinese Investors Buying Up Bitcoin as Yuan Falls
The reputation of bitcoin exchanges has been tarnished by regulatory scrutiny and a series of high-profile cyberattacks. In August, the Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said it was hacked, resulting in the theft of more than $60 million worth of bitcoin.
CME said its new indexes are based on data contributed by six bitcoin exchanges, including the international arm of China-based OKCoin, whose mainland Chinese platform is the world’s most active marketplace for trading the digital currency, according to bitcoinity.org.
“Our products launched will bring greater transparency to the bitcoin market,” said a CME spokeswoman. “We have a long history of developing nascent markets across asset classes for this same reason.”
The bitcoin exchanges contributing data to CME’s indexes “have been extensively vetted,” the spokeswoman added.
CME declined to comment on whether it planned to launch bitcoin futures. The exchange operator would need approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before it could move ahead with such a listing.
The new CME indexes shed light on a brewing battle among exchanges to cash in on the seven-year-old digital currency. Bats Global Markets Inc. is seeking regulatory approval to list an ETF linked to bitcoin prices that was developed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers and entrepreneurs made famous by their early role in the creation of Facebook Inc.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to decide whether to allow the proposed ETF by the Winklevoss brothers by early next year. There is already an ETF-style product called the Bitcoin Investment Trust available to U.S. investors, but it trades in the lightly regulated over-the-counter markets and has a spotty record of tracking the price.
The New York Stock Exchange started publishing a daily U.S. dollar price index for bitcoin last year. CME is seeking to one-up NYSE by introducing both a daily index and a real-time index updated every second, saying it has the best methodology for calculating a bitcoin benchmark. The real-time index went live on Sunday, while CME’s first daily index started Monday.
The Chicago-based exchange giant said it designed its new indexes to comply with international standards for the regulation of financial benchmarks. An independent oversight committee will help ensure the gauges aren’t prone to gaming by unscrupulous traders, CME says.
“Non-susceptibility to price manipulation is a core principle that is very important,” said Sandra Ro, executive director and digitization lead at CME.

As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: - boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: - can be transported over a communications channel If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it

talk about it when the time is right!
Dude, some years ago my family thought the same but after years of discussions and explaining they love bitcoin too ;-) - explain them that it is not just a coin, it is a network of computers "like the internet". dont force them to buy bitcoins by the way, you will feel when the time is right to give them 5 USD in bitcoins on their mobile app. than they can watch this funny money go up and down and they will probably love that feeling. and the modern apps are pretty userfriendly too (Breadwallet / Copay)
be gentle but persistent.

Epiphyte will add scale and speed to blockchains by adopting a payment channel approach. "It will allow us to perform within sort of like a walled garden or a VPN kind of environment – over the actual Bitcoin system, with actual Bitcoin, but that many of the transactions don't need to be written to the blocks.
"The transactions all can be written to blockchain; it's a little bit like the Lightning Network.
So end up with the same degree of security that you would get from blockchain transactions with a higher degree of scalability and privacy."

Quick ELI5:
Running XT at this time is equivalent with running Core. It's the same network, and the same Bitcoins. At some point in the future, if 75% mining majority is reached (but not before January 2016), the network will split whenever a miner creates a block larger than 1MB. This will not be accepted by Core unless they adopt a large blocks patch, but will be accepted by XT, and at this point there will effectively be two chains.
Running XT means that you will always be on the largest (75%+) chain, regardless of whether the fork actually happens or not. Running Core means that you will be left behind if a 75% majority is reached. Regardless of which version you run, coins will be safe (on both chains) as long as you acquired them prior to the fork, and for some time the chains will largely mirror each other.

Should Bitcoin grow, even if the network changes its structure as a result?
   The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users.

@_date: 2015-08-10 16:03:45
The vast majority of value that people transferred into Bitcoin is long-term speculation that its utility is enormous, and that economy based on it will grow. However, the bitcoin network currently faces a problem: the network produces one block every 10 minutes, and the block is hard-limited to never exceed 1MB. That translates to about ~3.5 transactions per second, which does not bode well for scaling (even with some innovations currently being hammered out, such as the Lightning Network). 
The developers who contribute to the bitcoin project are divided: One side, the more well-known among which are and propose some form of stepping up (either automatic and scheduled like halvings, or miner-voted) over time. Another group of devs, the more well-known among them being and (he proposed a very, very conservative alternative) are against such a change, stating that it will result in high bandwidth use and loss of decentralization. Lots of discussion were had about how bad/not-so-bad the impact actually was, and how to weigh it against the danger of stunting growth and/or centralizing somewhere else, but no agreement was reached.
Many actors in the space (exchanges, payment processors, big pool operators) have stated, in a scattershot way over time, that they support some form of maxblocksize increase; however, due to opposition from the latter group, no such increase has been merged into the Core code, for a long time.
In his frustration, Mike Hearn proposed (and later did) to include code for lifting the blocksize in his alternative client based on Core, Bitcoin-XT. It is still being tested, and is supposed to only go into effect if a supermajority of miner adopts it.

Then Sergio, the one that claimed to have the ASICBoost patent, came forward with a new the SEGWIT2MB proposal, which was already shot down 100’s of times before. This was after Rootstock got funded by Bitmain.
A day later BCoin’s proposal came with Extension Blocks which is compatible with ASICBoost. BCoin didn’t follow the normal rules of Bitcoin proposals but got the media immediately involved. EB was nothing new, they just needed another excuse to stall.

Roger hired some astroturfers, pays the mods and bought the sub. That is not a surprise if you observe this space.

i would have done the same back then

maybe that proposal is just too complicated and will bring too many problems with it.
iam still in favor of a smooth increase over time 2MB, 4 MB, 8MB, 14 MB...

if you supported BU until today, you are already lost.

Be careful with that idea. I guess most rich are not doing this because they would not be rich then.

Finally, Roger convinced these guys with his solid presentation!
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:28:27
with SegWit enabled this would be easy peasy lemon squeeze.
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:21:21
Naspers is the next goal.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:33:33
My guess: not many. Yep. Alot of the user at rbtc are paid to write FUD and a minority are noobs who have no clue.

21coins is already alot. 1 bitcoin should be sufficient when you want to buy a house in 15 years.
@_date: 2017-04-06 08:35:42
Jihad found an exploit in the bitcoin code that gives him a major mining advantage, this exploit (and his advantage) are eliminated by segwit.
He doesn't want to give up the major competitive edge he currently has that is earning him tens of millions per year in additional revenue.
Its like if you are playing an online game and you found a hack that lets you fly while others cannot and you have the power to prevent an update that would eliminate your power to fly. Only in this case we are talking about someone blocking billions in new investments and features in a revolutionary currency system for their own personal gain.
@_date: 2017-04-03 08:11:04
This. And you can´t find a compromise if the other party is malicious in the first place (like Roger who bough ton of alts or Jihad who is mining a ton of them each day)
(and SW is the compromise)
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:08:26

it is from blockchain.info, of course it is shit. sorry to say that but where did all the funding go?
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:20:14
dont forget that Roger is paying alot for astroturfing so there will always be "users" who will write that.

@_date: 2017-04-02 06:57:37
ChinaBU could bee a sideproject by the PBoC.
The PBoC wants to launch their own coin in the future, so why not using ChinaBU and some minese miners for that?
And it is naive to believe that you can run massive datacenters for bitcoin and the PBoC will not notice that, you need their approval. Jihad Wu has obviously their approval.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:51:59

@_date: 2017-04-15 16:18:19
honestly i dont know when he lost his way. it would be better if he would leave bitcoin and start his own coin or business. 
One good thing about Mike Hearn is, he left and shut up his mouth.
Roger has become a laughing stock at this point.
@_date: 2017-04-06 08:46:42

Predictions of the death of Moore’s law are nearly as old as the forecast itself. The truth is: it isnt dead. Moore’s law was the fifth, not the first, paradigm to bring exponential growth to the price-performance of computing. The law of accelerating returns does not pertain to feature size or clock speed but to calculations per second per constant dollar.

10% discount?
@_date: 2017-04-06 08:30:25
So, Blockstream is holding back bitcoin scaling so they can profit from their centralized product?
• Nope, that was Bitmain
So, SegWit is just overly complex code to sneak in discounts for Blockstream's "products"?
• Nope... that was Bitmain realizing SegWit negated their already profitable discount and ruined their product.
So Blockstream wants the bitcoin market to be centralized through a few central companies and hubs?
• Nope, that was Bitmain that wanted to maintain centralization of mining hardware and hashing power through their company and hubs.
So, Blockstream is centralized development and wants everyone to run the code that makes their company valuable?
• Nope, it is Bitmain that supports any competing client, regardless of the effect on Bitcoin, in order to maintain the code that is specifically profitable for them and them alone.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:06:09
Maybe you believe that because Roger pays u alot money? 
Why is he buying a ton of alts OTC and is hindering bitcoins growth all the time?

Message to Roger: theymos has nothing to do with SW and LN - buy a coffee and help to activate it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:44:14
with SW and LN we would be at 1500 - 2000 USD in a couple of days.

"Unlike what can be read in crypto space, there is no reliable source indicated that Belgium wants to ban bitcoin. Such a proposal would make absolutely no sense as we all know bitcoin can't be banned or regulated by its design. This is just bad journalism.

@_date: 2017-04-05 07:31:02
of course it is doable but we have to activate SW and LN for that + all the amazing stuff that follows after that will bring us easilie to 100B market cap.

yeah but it might take 200-300 years. nothing bad about PM these days. bitcoin will have its own problems in 200 years...or next month ;-P

Think about it:
Jihan didn’t support Segwit, was spreading lies in China about Core, which stalled the activation of Segwit.
When pressure started building he started supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, even though everyone knew that it was buggy and would destroy Bitcoin.
Then Sergio, the one that claimed to have the ASICBoost patent, came forward with a new the SEGWIT2MB proposal, which was already shot down 100’s of times before. This was after Rootstock got funded by Bitmain.
A day later BCoin’s proposal came with Extension Blocks which is compatible with ASICBoost. BCoin didn’t follow the normal rules of Bitcoin proposals but got the media immediately involved. EB was nothing new, they just needed another excuse to stall.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:36:48
some years ago i tried that too (discussing bitcoin) in some large forums and guess what? i was banned just 1-2 days later for just naming bitcoin. of course 2013 was different than 2017. we see progress here: u/nevile_schlongbottom get downvoted but now banned ;-D

no one is using bitcoin these days, fees are to damn high! Ask Roger, he made some solid slides on that.
@_date: 2017-04-22 07:58:15
that is possible of course. then Litecoin will add a softfork so that Jihad can spam even more.
i dont care. Just activate SW and we can do it for Bitcoin then. Maybe Jihad saved his face with this deal.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:01:08
2 weeks we know, but i can wait 5 years for mass adoption, no need to hurry :P

make more research.basically ChinaBU is only pushed by some chinese mining operators (mainly Jihad Wu), some untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.

to note that our estimate of the total number of active wallets 
does not include users whose exchange accounts serve as 
their de facto wallet to store cryptocurrency, nor users from 
payment service providers or other platforms that enable the 
storage of cryptocurrency. In other words, the total number of 
active cryptocurrency users is likely considerably higher than 
our estimate of unique active wallet users

dont be so pessimistic, patience you must have my young padawan :)
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:40:04
basically ChinaBU is only pushed by some chinese mining operators (mainly Jihad Wu), some untalented devs and RogerVer who is doing the payments for all that (and other unknown funding sources / probably chinese gov). It's like 5 people holding Bitcoin back because they, as non-engineers, disagree with how code was written.  ChinaBU destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin which are censorship resistance, robustness, permissionless and immutability. They even want to install a committee  (President of ChinaBU) for bitcoin which is just hilarious.

i guess people are tired of this. if we have solid software which gives cool new features most people will run it.
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:03:15
be careful when something is pushed from Roger Ver or Jihad. Add SegWit first.

mostly the uneducated. if you are new in bitcoin and dont know Szabo OR Ver - you take the easy answers like 
"Censorship! BIG BLOCKS FOR THE POOR PEOPLE + MORE MONEY!"
Roger is a politician like Trump and he plays like that.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:51:23
Something for rbtc. Maybe Roger can stop funding astroturfing then?
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:44:19

@_date: 2017-04-28 15:14:05
yes but what does mass adoption actually mean here? mass adoption does not happen overnight. that is a process which will take years.
no one actually knows or owns bitcoin right now and we are at 1300 USD - that is awesome!
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:00:38
It uses Proof of Vitalik which is not compatible with bitcoin.

i would guess Saudi.
yes, buy bitcoin with the 10 USD and play with it. sent it back and forth, buy something or donate 1-2 USD.
try 1-2 wallets. try to restore a wallet with the wallet seed...
check out some videos
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:48:42
UASF please.
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:54:58


cheap electricity and scale = profit. they make huge gains with that. bitcoin could be worth 400 USD and they would make profit...

How To Prevent It = dont give Roger and Jihad (and other miners) more control over it.

little Jihad was always a liar and a toxic piece in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-15 12:24:49
Jihad and Roger are trying hard but will fail. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:00:13


This means, that there will be less bitcoin in circulation and probably a higher price mid/long term right?
That would be a pretty good outcome for bitcoin.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:36:26
Hi chalash,


but is this still a valid assumption in the light of threats like these:


Jihad Wu may not act in a logical way. The PBoC is probably giving him money too. So he could repeat that 75% move again and again.
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:40:24
Roger rescued enough of his money to buy coffee - that's all that counts!
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:58:25

Ich würde den Artikel erstmal aus dem Netz nehmen aber auf keinen Fall etwas bezahlen oder unterschreiben.
Wenn der Artikel (wie du sagst) nur das wiedergibt, was die BaFin gesagt hat, brauchst du dir sowieso keine Gedanken zu machen. Alles andere sollte (sofern nicht zu krass) unter Pressefreiheit fallen.
Sofern du den Artikel nicht löschen willst (was ich umso besser finden würde), würde ich aber eine Klarstellung hinzufügen. 
Ich bezweifle das bei Szenario 1: „Bitcoin vs: Onecoin“ mehrere tausend € zusammen kommen. 
Ergo: Weder bezahlen oder etwas unterschreiben. Klarstellung hinzufügen. Ich bezweifel das die Gegenseite am Ende tatsächlich  den lange Weg einer gerichtlichen Auseinandersetzungen gehen will bei dieser Faktenlage.
PS: Der Anwalt hat übrigens mal einen Aufsatz zu "Publikationen 2006:

"GenCoin, the fictional digital currency used in the show, loosely represents bitcoin, currently world's largest digital currency. Given that it's difficult to regulate and trace, some say it's an ideal vehicle for criminal activity such as money laundering."
"People have heard about digital currency, but they really don't understand how it operates. They just see it on the headlines," Stoeckert told CNBC. "This is one way they can follow a story line and get a unique perspective on it," he added."
oh yeah, that is great education!

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their involvement in the beginnings of Facebook FB +1.46% and for having competed in the Olympics — not to mention their 6’5” height, Harvard and Oxford pedigrees and identical looks — were vacationing in Ibiza in 2012 when a friend of a friend introduced them to Bitcoin.
Just as they had never intended for rowing to become such a big part of their lives when they first walked into a boathouse at 15, Tyler says of how they found themselves captivated by Bitcoin, “we were on vacation, not looking for the next big thing, but that’s how it always works. It’s very serendipitous. You don’t predict when you’re going to fall in love.”
Describing how they began buying and studying Bitcoin and found themselves “sucked in,” he concludes, “This was a pretty heady romance.”
In the latest episode of my blockchain and fintech podcast, Unchained, (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio), Tyler and Cameron, chief executive officer and president, respectively, of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and the first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), tell us what else occupied them in the years between the 2008 Olympics and the launch of Gemini in 2015, discuss the importance of regulation in a sector once associated in popular culture with illicit activity and explain why we’ve seen so many hacks of Bitcoin exchanges.
Tyler, left, and Cameron, right, and I did not get this dressed up to record the podcast! I forgot to photograph us the day we recorded, but we had another opportunity the next day when we spoke at the San Francisco Money show. Hence, more formal attire. (Beth Kurteson)
Tyler, left, and Cameron, right, and I did not get this dressed up to record the podcast! I forgot to photograph us then, but we had another opportunity the next day when we spoke at the San Francisco Money show. Hence, the more formal attire. Also, it must be noted I was wearing heels. (They were not.) (Beth Kurteson)
Having majored in economics at Harvard, the brothers were intrigued by Bitcoin because they had never before conceived of currencies beyond fiat ones. “It was a big eye-opener that all of a sudden there was this huge alternative,” says Cameron. “It’s almost like finding a new color. Thinking about all the different aspects of it, we figured this is probably a pretty binary outcome — it’s either a zero or an enormous new opportunity.”

Having grown up in an entrepreneurial- and business-focused household, they also liked that “Bitcoin is both disruptive from a technology perspective but there’s a tremendous power of social good behind it. So you can both build a cool business or have a great investment return and there’s the promise of potentially improving the remittance industry or banking the unbanked,” says Cameron.
Even their experience in Ibiza underscored how much of a technological improvement Bitcoin offered. Something went wrong with the payment for the hotel and they realized that overnighting checks to themselves would be faster than a bank wire — not as easy as email.
“When you think about how everything else works in the digital age and the way that money does, money really falls short,” says Tyler, saying money acts “pre-internet.”
After studying the space some (and investing in several cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin hardware and software firm 21 and Bitcoin vault Xapo), they decided to become a “picks and shovels” company for the industry — a fully licensed and regulated cryptocurrency exchange that would facilitate a liquid market in digital assets.
Noting that the United States has some of the strongest regulation and consumer protections in the world and that that framework fosters some of the globe’s most liquid markets, Cameron says, “Try to imagine a world without the NYSE or Nasdaq or the BATS exchange. The equity markets wouldn’t exist.” (The twins recently switched the designated exchange for their proposed ETF, which will be called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and trade under the ticker symbol COIN, from Nasdaq to BATS.)
Tyler adds, “Every investor around the world wants to invest in U.S. markets because they’re regulated, and they’re licensed, they’re trustworthy, they have confidence. If you take that away, the global economy will take a hit like nothing else. We want to create that for Bitcoin.”
They also place an emphasis on regulation and security because they feel that the positive social impact Bitcoin could have, in terms of banking the unbanked or slashing remittance costs, isn’t worth anything unless it can be secured properly. Discussing the recent hack of about $70 million worth of Bitcoin from Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex — the second-largest Bitcoin theft in history — they say that operators of exchanges and their regulators need to look closely at the details, to, for instance, see how a “multisig” security service (one that requires a majority of multiple pre-authorized signatures, such as two of three or three of five) is actually implemented.
Bitcoin, which initially took off among the libertarian crowd, has many fans who don’t like the idea of centralized exchanges, and they often point to the hacks as evidence that such exchanges are a bad idea. “We’d love to create a decentralized exchange,” says Tyler, “but … people don’t know how to do it yet at the scale and the speed required for the players in the legacy financial world. So when you think about the speeds happening at Nasdaq of NYSE, it’s microseconds. It’s orders of magnitude [faster than Bitcoin].” (On average, it takes ten minutes for a Bitcoin transaction to be processed and on average an hour for it to be considered irreversible.)
Tune into the episode (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, web) to find out what investing behaviors they’re seeing from professional traders and institutional investors, how the blue-chip Wall Street types are currently getting involved, and what Tyler and Cameron believe to be the next hot thing in the cryptocurrency space.
Plus, Cameron tells us what he really thinks about the efforts of incumbent financial institutions to create private blockchains and Tyler reveals how much money he has in his wallet.

@_date: 2017-04-06 08:54:08
Think about it:
Jihan didn’t support Segwit, was spreading lies in China about Core, which stalled the activation of Segwit.
When pressure started building he started supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, even though everyone knew that it was buggy and would destroy Bitcoin.
Then Sergio, the one that claimed to have the ASICBoost patent, came forward with a new the SEGWIT2MB proposal, which was already shot down 100’s of times before. This was after Rootstock got funded by Bitmain.
A day later BCoin’s proposal came with Extension Blocks which is compatible with ASICBoost. BCoin didn’t follow the normal rules of Bitcoin proposals but got the media immediately involved. EB was nothing new, they just needed another excuse to stall.

the mistake that alot of (especially young) people make is, that they have no investment horizon. they want everything NOW. they (old&amp;young) want to be rich now, not in 1 year, or 5 or 10 years - NOW! when it is not now, it is boring and they waste their money on something else.
if you ask 100 people if they would take 100 USD now or 500 USD in a month, 98% would take the 100 USD.
but you will probably always be a peasant with that thinking.
the most amazing and interesting thing to me was always, how young and immature bitcoin is. because that means there is so much opportunity! it is not a bug, it is a feature ;-D

At very high transaction rates each block can be over half a gigabyte in size.
It is not required for most fully validating nodes to store the entire chain. In Satoshi's paper he describes "pruning", a way to delete unnecessary data about transactions that are fully spent. This reduces the amount of data that is needed for a fully validating node to be only the size of the current unspent output size, plus some additional data that is needed to handle re-orgs. As of October 2012 (block 203258) there have been 7,979,231 transactions, however the size of the unspent output set is less than 100MiB, which is small enough to easily fit in RAM for even quite old computers.
Only a small number of archival nodes need to store the full chain going back to the genesis block. These nodes can be used to bootstrap new fully validating nodes from scratch but are otherwise unnecessary.
The primary limiting factor in Bitcoin's performance is disk seeks once the unspent transaction output set stops fitting in memory. It is quite possible that the set will always fit in memory on dedicated server class machines, if hardware advances faster than Bitcoin usage does.

Facebook (put in every stock, gold or anything else) early adopters got 'rich' because other people came in the future with large sums of fiat money to give them because they were motivated by someone else coming along down the line as well.

i will probably hold bitcoin for the rest of my life. you could sell 50% at 10k and buy something for it.
when we hit 20k you spend 50% of your coins and so on. that would be a strategy. but i cant imagine that i would sell all coins at some point, i wouldnt even do that at $100.000k.
or we hit 0 and i still hold ;-)

i understand your issue and i feel it too. fees are too expensive for alot of small transactions atm. but with LN it will be feasible again AND you have a great store of value with robust decentralization. so i am patient and i see the light on the end of the tunel. (keep in mind: we would already have LN since jan but malicious people like Roger Ver and Jihad Wu are damaging it for their own interests!)

@_date: 2017-05-28 12:24:12
This is a post for the newbies here who are scared of losing money on or immediately after the 1st of August due to UASF.
For those of us who know what UASF is and how it works, we have plans about what to do and will do it. This might be for example selling off our coins on the legacy chain and buying more on the new chain (this is what I'll be doing), or vice-versa (although vice-versa would seem extremely stupid to me as the risk of losing it all by having the chain wiped out is very high, it's something someone might choose to do).
For those of you who don't really get it though and don't really want to learn all about it, the simple advice is to do nothing. This means that you should not make any bitcoin transactions during this time. If you expect someone to send you BTC for whatever reason, ask them to do so before the 1st of August or to wait until a clear resolution (probably only a few days, but theoretically could be longer).
Watching this sub will help you figure out whether (and in which way) the situation has resolved. There will be posts either talking about the legacy chain being reorganised in to the new chain, which means that the UASF succeeded and there is now only one chain; or there will be posts talking about how there are now two chains with the legacy chain activating a hard-fork to avoid being reorganised in to the UASF chain (technically in that case there are three chains for a brief period, but the real legacy one pre-hardfork would be reorganised in to the UASF chain once everyone else moved to the hardforked one, ending up with two chains that are now entirely independent).
The reorganisation of the legacy chain in to the UASF chain is a clear signal of the end of the period of uncertainty. Two continuing chains without someone hardforking however means that transactions on the legacy chain are always at risk of being wiped out by being reorganised in to the UASF chain at some point and therefore uncertainty continues to exist. This is why eventually a hardfork would occur (probably based around the SegWit-on-bit4/2MB idea) on the legacy chain and it would then be safe from reorganisation.
All bitcoins you have currently will continue to hold value and can not be 'lost' if you never transact them during the chain split. In the first case - where the legacy chain reorganised in to the UASF chain - your coins will be valid on this new chain and you can transact them with confidence. In the second case - where a hardfork occurred and there are now two chains forevermore - the coins you hold will exist on both chains and can be transacted independently on both. Instructions will likely be clearly available on this subreddit about how to make sure you can indeed use them on both instead of only one.
As one exception: If an exchange or other online wallet where you do not have custody of the keys is holding your coins, then its entirely up to them whether you lose them or not or which chain they can be transacted on in the case of a split. While I think every major player will do their best to ensure you keep them and can transact them on both chains, there is no guarantee of this. If you have a significant amount of money there, you should move them to a system where you control the keys instead such as a wallet on your computer or smartphone/tablet (with appropriate backup and security precautions) or a hardware wallet device (much much safer). It's worth pointing out that this advice is generally true at all times even without the UASF or other forks.
All of the above said, I strongly recommend reading up more about the technology and proposals and then taking an active role instead. The greater the number of individuals involved actively in the future of bitcoin, the better it will be since you are not letting others choose and speak on your behalf (this is the main point of decentralisation as a general concept, which is a key aspect of bitcoin).
TL/DR: If you don't understand what's going on and don't want to learn, just avoid sending or receiving coins after 2017-07-31 until it's all over. They'll be safe. 
Make sure you hold your private keys, dont store them on a third party.

i call him selfish and Jihad is harming bitcoin since months/years. time to get rid of this guy.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:17:21


Barry´s ETF. Maybe he has a real chance to launch it because he spend his life in the financial business and knows this shit. We will see.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:18:58

Loop would be interesting though.

most people dont have an idea how bitcoin works and they probably think after a hack, that bitcoin is broken or something. part of the problem, but i like these times, i like it!

good that i did that several times over the years :-P

After considering all of the above, I cannot help but think of the call to hardfork Bitcoin to a permanent inflationary schedule as an unfortunate sequel to other knee-jerk reactions we’ve seen in the past.

DAMN u motherfucker - you are back again!
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:10:32


I doubt that. Bitcoins halving mechanism and adoption rate will make sure that we will not hit a ceiling of 20% returns in 5 years. I expect exponential growth over the next 5, 10, 15 years.
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:41:49
nice presentation. pretty fast sometimes and you have to click to the next slide at the right time to do the jokes right.
but good work.

@_date: 2017-05-04 12:21:57
Jihad Wu (CEO of Bitmain) is making 100 mio per year as long as he blocks SegWit because he uses a special mining trick (and also has a patent on that). That is the reason why he is blocking it but we will activate it in the end. The benefits of SW and LN (u need SW for a good LN) are enormous and we wont let a malicious miner dictate what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:55:55


make some thinking what you will do with the time / years.
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:06:04


True. If we would be at this stage already, bitcoin would be 50,000 USD a coin. We need more L2 technologies for that and it will take some years. Be patient.

@_date: 2017-05-28 07:34:36


But they want bigger blocks too. This makes no sense. But wait a minute: Maybe they dont want bigger blocks but only make more money with Asicboost because Jihad Wu is a corrupt fucker? Hmmm - i could be onto something here.

@_date: 2017-05-28 12:31:07


the guys are disappointing. Miners will not decide what bitcoin is or we can end this project at this point.
better use Samourai Wallet. these folks have a good spirit.

i dont think that is correct ;-) , and SW will raise the limit.

You have my sword. But even after BIP148, we have more options. Bitcoin will fight until the end.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:20:05
4000 USD is possible with LN and SW but 13k this year is a bit too much ;-)

For sure! :-P

BIP148 is the only way at this point :-) ! No sane Bitcoiner would install this FrankensteinSegWit Shit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:41:39
i understand your issue and i feel it too. fees are too expensive for alot of small transactions atm. but with LN it will be feasible again AND you have a great store of value with alot of decentalzion. so i am patient and i see the light on the end of the tunel.

(LOL - no joke, i know that is sad. Roger lost his mind somewhere...)
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:07:28
No, there is no more room, it is a fixed cap. Satoshi once said:
"If my B-Coin project will reach 0,5% of gold, it will stop and now I want my free lunch." End of the story.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:55:40
Could be the case because Roger paid alot of sock puppets for write propganda and even the mods (all main mods) are paid shills (also on bitcoin,com)

	Employees of asset manager Fidelity can now pay for their canteen lunch using bitcoin: a mark of the determination of Abigail Johnson, the company’s chief executive, to position it as a digital-currency pioneer.
Sample the FT’s top stories for a week

Speaking on stage on Tuesday morning at Consensus, a bitcoin-themed conference in New York, Ms Johnson noted that Fidelity has made venture investments in a handful of bitcoin-linked businesses, while partnering with various academic initiatives to explore possible usages of blockchain, the electronic ledger originally built to underpin bitcoin markets.
“I am in a traditional financial services business — but we at Fidelity can see that the evolution of technology is setting our industry up for disruption,” she said. “What if this technology could do for the transfer of value, what the internet did for the transfer of information?”
Ms Johnson noted that Fidelity has also set up a bank of computers built by 21 Inc, that can crunch complex algorithms to be rewarded with bitcoin.
    We at Fidelity can see that the evolution of technology is setting our industry up for disruption. What if this technology could do for the transfer of value, what the internet did for the transfer of information?
    Abigail Johnson, Fidelity chief executive
“My . . . computer has mined over 200,000 satoshis,” she said, using the name for the smallest unit of bitcoin. One satoshi — named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the crypto currency — is equal to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.
“I love this stuff . . . and what the future holds,” said Ms Johnson. “I’d like to think that huge new markets and products will be built on these open platforms.”
The remarks underscore the desire of traditional financial-services groups like Fidelity not to get left behind, as digital currencies begin to affect the way Wall Street does business. Promoters say that adoption of blockchain-style technologies will lead to cheaper, more secure ways of settling all kinds of transactions.
Regulators, however, continue to view bitcoin and other alt-currencies with suspicion, fearing that it has become the currency of choice for cyber-criminals.
In March the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it would not allow Bats Global Markets to list shares of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund based on concerns that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”.
Ms Johnson, president and chief executive of Fidelity since 2014, assumed full control of the company late last year when her 86-year-old father, Edward “Ned” Johnson III, said that he would retire after nearly six decades with the company, latterly as chairman.

The latest online investing craze has shades of dotcom exuberance
The 71-year-old company now holds some $2.2tn in managed assets, and handles the retirement and savings plans of approximately 26m people and 23,000 companies.
The Consensus event, hosted by Coindesk, a publishing group, comes as the price of bitcoin has rocketed to a record high, changing hands on Monday at over $2,110.
Bitcoin is up about 135 per cent against the US dollar this year, making it easily the world’s best-performing currency. The nearest rivals are the Icelandic krona (up 16 per cent), the Mexican peso and the Polish zloty (both up 13 per cent).
Ms Johnson noted that so far, fewer than 100 Fidelity employees had used the alt-currency option in the cafeteria at headquarters.
“I guess we have a lot of hodlers,” she said, using the slang for bitcoin users who avoid selling the currency when it jumps in value

When you can say this you are already a wealthy man. You have a good way of thinking. Dont just waste money for useless stuff (but dont be stingy to yourself too).
Maybe you are not a "car guy". Maybe you would like to have a fast new PC. Do it. Maybe you can make some investements in other things which generate an income.
And save the rest and live your good life :)

Financial services provider SolidX Partners Inc. on Tuesday disclosed plans for an initial public offering for SolidX Bitcoin Trust.
SolidX Partners provides blockchain-based software services relating to the recording of records, transfer of assets and identity.
The New York-based company said in its S-1 securities filing Tuesday that the offering will allow investors to witness the daily change in bitcoin’s U.S. dollar price before expenses and liabilities of the trust, as measured by the Trade Block XBX Index. SolidX said the trust isn’t actively managed.
The trust will be listed on NYSE Arca under ticker symbol XBTC. In the filing, the company said it planned to raise up to $1 million, though that is a placeholder number and could change.

Now which coin will have more value over the mid/long run? ;-)
it doesnt matter if you have some business on board and some mining power. write code, be part of the open source process or leave. simple as that.

Ethereum is more centralized in governance, has an open-ended coin supply and a willingness to do bailouts as needed.
