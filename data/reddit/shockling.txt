Valve is not real big on communication. They very rarely make annoucements outside of conventions. But as seen by this subreddit they don't need to anounce it the community promotes to it's self.

I know I've destroyed about 2 coins by accident. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:58:52
Honestly this sub has been fucked for the past year. all meme no conversation on issues.

Hey look everybody, advertising.

I read a stat while that 70% of US bills are held out of the US. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 03:39:09
If I recall humpthebundle.com has like 25% bitcoin sales. Even though most of its for charity bitcoin is definitly growing in porn.

It's not about what he's doing now it's about what he has already done. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:39:17
Bitcoin has stayed within 10% for 6 months now. No one is taking significant loses from buying right now. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 02:37:42
lol at the redditor for 13 days tag. Why even look?
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:14:01
Its been in a 800$ range for 6 months
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:13:35
I believe after all coins have been mined the transaction fee, that is so small now will bump slightly to accommodate for the cost of mining. This transaction fee is given directly  to the miner. The higher your transaction fee the faster it will be put in the block.

Everything is in a bubble if the time period is long enough.

I remember seeing this chart last time market price hit $1000.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:47:59
Well this ride never ends so I don't see the analogy 
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:49:12
All it takes is one mod.

Currency is usless if not used to exchange value.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:07:14
I have 2 accounts save and spend. I put 10% into spend every time I buy. The way I see it if you don't use bitcoin it can't grow. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:34:19
0% fee for transactions over 50 million. I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:57:16
But does it even need to be mainstream to accomplish its purpose? As long as bitcoin is being traded it will be a decentralized measurse for all other currency. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:15:14
Do BTC faucets still exist?
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:28:06
You can use any private key. The paper is just how you store it. If you wanted you could export a key from any of your clients and print a qr code. No need for extra software.
@_date: 2015-08-21 14:23:07
Exactly if you are just going to mess around with transactions and maybe buy a coffee or somthing you don't need $100

Important clarification
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:52:10
Lol 15%
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:28:35
I agree with this. There is a reason they are shutting down, good or bad, I believe they know what they are doing and nobody can stop them.

Just don't go hunting for cp and you will be fine. all though an extended stay on the /hebe/ board may get you put on some lists. Best way to stay safe is tor. Even if you aren't doing anything illegal.
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:28:32
Yeah you know there's a trouble maker in every crowd. It's legal because clothes. Hotwheels made 8ch with the idea you can post anything. This was during the gamergate fiasco on 4chan where everyone was getting censored. So all the hardcore 4chaners, the hackers and pedos and just all around fucked up left and joined 8ch. It's a vile place but boards like /v/ are pretty legit and keep to there own.

You invest your savings in gold right?
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:27:48
How did you get here? I am so confused.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:43:37
Not to mention we are using the internet to push bitcoin. If the internet didn't exist but bitcoin still worked no one would know about it. Pure word of mouth to push bitcoin. The number of articles would be minuscule. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:40:57
The dark net can be pretty dank. Also fullchan has an onion link.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:47:40
I believe the point is that this is the daily mail which I assume has a different audience than reddit.
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:54:27
Twitter uploads are just a shit. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:04:33
The point of the conversion is trading something you have for something you want. You can trade anything for bitcoin if the person you are trading with wants what you have. So credit cards are the most accessible form of payment because they can be used around the world so you can trade with anyone that wants fiat. If bitcoin become more widely adopted less people will want to trade for fiat as it is not valuable and instead you will be trading services and products for bitcoin.
As for wallet fees there are none. The only fees are transaction fees which are essentially a bounty. You put a price on your transaction and for that price hopefully someone will verify it. The higher the price the more likely it will be verified sooner. Right now transaction fees are 2-3 cents.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:07:34
I have no sympathy.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:11:15
If you never sell, it has no value.
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:08:45
Well the article from yesterday mentioned this guy had been asking first.

Is it over 9000? No? Then the answer is no. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:55:54
too much work.

His point is that keys can bey lost through theft, corruption, whatever. Having all of your money in one address is dangerous. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:09:21
Proud to say I was one of those 168 btc sales and also the first time I ever bought porn.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:12:19
Personally the most bitcoin I have ever held is 2.5, currently I have about 1. But total I have probably bought and sold 10. Now I am in college so I dont have a lot of extra cash which affects how much I can buy greatly.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:09:38
Honestly, I personally have no clue but it doesn't matter because I don't run a node. I'll let all the smart people figure it out.
