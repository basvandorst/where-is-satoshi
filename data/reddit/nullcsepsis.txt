Under no circumstance was Satoshi's vision 1mb. While Satoshi indeed created the 1mb blocksize to temporarily stop spam until blocks were full with real traffic. He made it very clear blocks would be upgraded in the future. Why do you even think there is so much outrage from the people who actually respect the man? It was an expectation from the start to upgrade the blocksize... it was always the plan and the current team who swept in... again... after years of publicly dumping on Bitcoin... want to completely re-engineer Bitcoin into something is has never been, a settlement layer. Which is pretty cool, but still certainly doesn't require blocksize to be artificially restricted to 1mb. We should be actual blocksize increases AND segwit. 
I'm tired of this and won't be responding anymore.

You are stating that people who follow Satoshi's actual plan/vision/execution of Bitcoin is something "Ver Brigade" people want and thus fluff. Satoshi Nakamoto... the creator of Bitcoin... wasn't part of the Ver Brigade. His vision... was his vision... not Vers. Big blockers and Ver simply respect him. By dismissing people that respect him... you are essentially saying Satoshi is fluff to you, and really Bitcoin should fluff too if you feel the genius that created it was massively wrong. Satoshi... what a damned idiot, right? That imbecile wanted big blocks! The real geniuses are the people programmers that crapped on Bitcoin for years... yet now somehow hold so much power over it.

Big blockers where around long before Ver took up a 'leadership' position and became the easy target.
