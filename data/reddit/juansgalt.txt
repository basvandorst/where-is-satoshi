wallets that support LN are part of the market problem right now. I think it's great that you are working on such a wallet.
Is there a place to have conversation about LNs right now? if not, where should we make one? I like reddit slack is kind of a pain.
I agree this is needed.

My friend that's been looking into this writes:
not very accurate but might be useful.  Pretty much all of the ones that mention UK/Gibraltar don't work outside Europe.  The ones that were working in Europe only all got cancelled by Visa yesterday. So WireX/Tenx etc all have 0 customers.
Wagecan is one that might work and I am going to take a closer look at Spectrocoin.
Some of the ones that say U.S. aren't available and others that say U.S. are only available to U.S. citizens. Bitpay for example. Nathan has a card with them.

try finding a wallet that lets you choose the fee and pay about 5 dollars. then wait a few days :P You'll see the transaction, but it won't be confirmed by some services until it gets 'confirmations'.
It's growing pains. a lot of the altcoins don't have these problems yet.

We need consumer grade wallets to support them. So from a PR perspective, put preasure on all software ones. mycelium (meh, no segwit yet), samurai wallet (YEY), green address, electrum. 
Hardware wallets, Trezor, Ledger Nano S. 
once wallets support it, nodes will make more sense. specially once people realize they can be profitable to run.

If we say that ranking is based on market cap. And we say that market cap = supply of units plus spot price in USD, then fundamentally the amount of units on the market does not matter.
If I make 10 coins and sell each at 1 USD, my MC will be 10 USD. If I make 100 coins and sell each at 10 cents, my market cap will be 10 USD.
Premine does not matter when it comes to market cap. 
Also, I made that comparison because of the technology. Its pretty easy to argue that DASH and NXT are technologically superior than Doge and LTC. Though I can't say I'm an expert on the latter, and I am a small investor in the first.

If it 'wins' it won't necessarily be because it is a better system, but rather because it was first. Just look at Doge ffs, or lite coin. How are they further ahead than DASH or NXT?

If the US gov wanted him dead, they would have killed him. If they killed him it would have been a bloody scandal, probably why they avoided it. 
They key thing to understand about this whole Kim Dotcom thing is that the US gov is hunting him down because of Holywood and Sony among other looby efforts. They don't want him dead nessesarily, they want his torrenting and file sharing empire to be destroyed, because they want a legal monopoly to profit from ideas for ever. 
Bitcoin and multisig in particular would have made their political attack much more difficult than just calling a few bankers with lawyer speak and getting accounts closed.

Not that simple when you have to type it with your thumbs. I find the log in process to airbitz dreadfully painfull. Usernames and passwords don't go well with mobile. 
Myceliyum on the other hand is plug and play and after you put a pin it is a 5-6 digit pass that is muuuch easier to type and remember then username and pass. 
If you do the backup you don't have to worry about the login anymore. 
So annoying do I find that system that I just stopped suggesting it to my nooby friends, its too frustrating for me and some of them.

What ever happened to web of trust? It doesn't have to be a technically complex implementation.  
Have the MVPs choose 5 people, and those 5 people, choose 3 people. and those 3 people choose 3 people.  
Or something like that. And make an invite only group.   
I've been making and moderating groups of under 100 people for years, one that is particularly dramatic has become stable with this image pinned to the top. (Link below)
I'm not saying you have to pin the pyramid of argumentation like I did, I have no doubt u understand it well, but the reminder helps this group and keeps people civil. And I kick the obviously malicious shit posters. That's a public group tho.   
For what Maxwell is asking for, an invite only group might be the way, using other public venues to find new talent that proves them selves civil and serious.   
Tho yeah that would lose the public anyone can talk aspect of it. Tricky. Twitter is getting better at dealing with stuff like this in the public square, but probable not for highly technical discussions that demand focus and high respect.

atomic swaps will (if ever implemented, fingers crossed) allos for p2p cross blockchain, trustless trades, yes.
But you'll still be trading tokens that are isolated to their own blockchain features, on their on chain networks.
These things are basically nation states built in cypher space. 
I can trade with other nations, but trading its self does not turn your nation into your neighbour's.
I guess thats a weak example.

Interesting. Yeah I def need to learn more about the history of this word. Competence hierarchies is another good term. or organic peer review. 
never the less, there does as far as I gather seem to be some screening. 
Code maintainers of which I believe there are three are the only one that can actually update the source. Which begs the question, what do they do during controversy? do they only accept very high consensus or high approval proposals? 
I could also ask how they are elected, but I already looked into that, it seems to be a chain of trust more or less unbroken coming from Nakamoto.

 Peter Todd, Applied cryptography engineer, and past Bitcoin Core contributor makes the case that UASF and the 2017 fork was a conflict of expectations between what miners thought their business model might be and what Bitcoin users actually wanted from them.

I'm not talking about spending. Not a kensian here. All im saying is. Having a lot of something that no one wants, does not make it valuable.
Yes, Hodl makes sense  on many levels, BTC will become a currency when we get to the moon.
But if on the way to the moon we change this rocket so much that it loses its value to buyers. Then HODL will become bag holding and we gonna crash and burn. 
Make sense?
SO far, looks like digital hold and settlement layer is a win. tho we'll see, the fork has not individuated the value propositions against digital cash for the short to mid term. Til LN is out in full force.

he claimed bitcoin intentionally has high fees and slower blocks. 
The facts and correlation seems pretty clear. BCH's EDA difficulty algorythm hyper inflated its money supply by dramatically lowering its mining difficulty, and thus paying miners to move to BCH, slowing down the BTC chain and thus filling up its blocks.
This resulted in high tx fees for some times, which are corrolated with EDA difficulty.
BCH has now changed their difficulty algorithm.
But the point is, most recent examples of high tx fees are correlated to BCH's manipulation of their inflation.

not sure where our disagreement is exactly. if supply is halved over night, the price of units has to go up, assuming the same demand.
And the change in supply with bitcoin halvings, is pretty disconnected from sources of demand. 
If people are buying as MoE, the daily supply  rate halving is hardly relevant. 
If they buy as SoV, it is certainly not bearish. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:35:34

But in all honestly. what I actually expect will happen, is a massive dump of b2x on day 0 post fork. and then 2 or 3 days of volatile hash rate, maybe a week, coinbase and gdax get embarased as fuck cuz of their stupid stance and bitpay loses a big client or two.... (I hope steam finds a new payment processor). anyways they might get in line after. 
I have not looked into bitpay competitors, but fk there's gotta be some one competente out there taking this opportunity. 
And yeah , miners give up and move back to bitcoin,. its gonna be a fascinating week.

that's hell of an argument. What about western manufacturers? AMD, Nvidia, Intel? 
Don't you think they'll want a piece? Correct my if my ignorance shows. 
Not well educated on the inner markets of hardware. 
Also, what would Core change a pow to, equihash? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:40:45
Yeah, that's interesting. so the 51% attack as was talked about classically is more or less fiction, given that there's other attacks like just trying to kill btc as a whole or trying to pump an altchain like 2x, or bch, which can be a lot more profitable. 
I have direct confirmation from a reasonably sized mining pool of the exact supply chain control argument u just put forth. 
Unless we see other major manufacturers also back by their governments as we are probably seeing with bitmain, then i see no real end to this.
Tho this test we are about to go through will no doubt reveal how strong miners really are in the face of the bitcoin price. 
I do expect western manufacturers to enter the market big in the not too distant future.

wouldn't a pow change be a hard fork requiring full node upgrades? 
would a pow change be backwards compatible?.
Another explanation for their behaviour is that Jihan Wu is being blackmailed to no end by Choyna, while at the same time bribed. 
Making B2X an attempt at taking over Bitcoin by the chinese government.
Why wouldn't they try? They are well on their way to becoming the next top world power.. and all they had to do is manipulate mining farms through Bitmain's supply chain into playing along with the b2x scam.

according to coin.dance it has fallen to about 84% as of right now. Slush and f2pool are not part of it. (MINERS, MOVE OVER THERE)

The only victims of democracy are whose who loudly oppose it. Everyone else is either participating of pasively volunteering.

Holy fuck. Just be a dumb comliant middle of the road dumb fk. And ull fit right in.

So generate your keys offline on cold storage computer and signed txs from offline pc. Wouldn't that be the easiest work around? not saying practical for everyone, but its not a hopeless situation. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:52:05
Do it in a public place. With someone u already vetted. Go to btc meetups and make friends. First. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 06:55:29
How many nodes does bitcoin have? last figure I heard was 700. 2400 sounds amazing to me. 
Every dev I've asked about isntantx that's not from DASH says that intant tx are impossible and that the system is rype for being exploited, tho they admitedly have not looked into it. The idea that consensus takes time is solid in bitcoin land, but not sure IX works the same way. Rant over. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 19:42:00
To be even more clear. Those who loudly oppose it and fail.    
But there's arguments for it as shitty as it can be. Being a cowboy can be fun but also a shit show. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:58:36
who's left other then bitfury?
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:50:18
go to bitcoin meetups. Sell in smaller amounts. Til u find someone u think is good. Then also sell in small amounts. Undet the aml limits.

what's wrong with perpetual inflation? Gold is perpetually inflating, just diminishes. It has to be limited in earth, but asteroid mining. . . .
The problem is not perpetual inflation. The problem is accountable allocation of inflation.
Granted, if we are talking about resource allocation. Then the real problem is about user's capacity to negotiate price mechanisms and trade computing resources.
The lack of financial incentives to run full blockchain nodes is the real problem here, and that avg users have no means to negotiate with the nodes that rout their txs to miners etc.

How ironic that you are trolling the person asking the legitimate questions, while accusing them of trolling. How about you address the topic and stop attacking the person? This is a legit threat to Bitcoin's Fungibility.

Hodl is a meme.   
Its true ish.   
In reality, you should maybe consider taking profits at a target price.

one man's spam is another's secure authentication. 
I agree, that's why limited block space is important.
Otherwise. Datacenters.

have you read pamela morgan's book on this topic? must read if you have not.  
Careful to give your private keys to your lawyer if he is a crypto noob, many wills are public data, which might be accessible by the public, your pks included.
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:46:08
it's gonna get even funner than that. state fiat will become digitized in crypto form and it will start floating around other countries, expanding and thinning the reach of nation states.  
Bitcoin will be in the frey competing.

in the long term yeah, we need to reach price stability first. lightning has to be working smoothly and easily and then we more likely beat things like a centralized usd crypto.

I debated Roger Ver live on radio.   
I'm a Bitcoin maximalist ( a moderate one)  
This might answer your question.  
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:30:39
I agree, but based on more than a gut feeling.   
TD analysis shows a 9 on the daily after a 13. Volume is slowing down, and we mooned at a parabolic rate, it feels over bought.  
Also, 9k memes may be resistance as much as they are support.

I asked Tone Vays this question at a conf recently, he said 50k, i say 110k  
And im buying the correction and getting back in.
