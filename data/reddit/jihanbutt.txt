This is what I was talking about
And I didn't even say anything positive about anything 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:48:07
Tbf, if you say anything positive about b c h here you also get downvoted (that's if you're lucky, else you get banned)
Even vitalik tweeted about these moderation "issues"

You think exchanges nowadays are using any kind of willybot 2.0 in order to pump btc?

AXP is an utility token and is SEC approved
The last thing you want is bring even more unwanted attention to this shady space
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:58:12
That's not how math works
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:53:20
Not really, since the person who holds the stock holds ownership in a physical company and most of them pay dividends 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:56:07
The whole crypto space is nothing but a ponzi scheme

Yeah, it jumped off the cliff

Google "steam Bitcoin", they said they don't want anything to do with Bitcoin because of its' volatility. No one wants to get paid in some currency that can go down or up 30% overnight.

No, not really

His email got hacked at some point
I'm surprised that address still exists
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:54:14
Yeah that's exactly what you do when you shill your coin to other people
The value of your coins increase when someone else buy, that's why shills exist
Why do everyone in crypto seek 'mass adoption'? Because they want more people buying in and pumping the price of their coins
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:16:19
It's not that simple: A stocks value is based on the percieved value of the company and their products/services, not how much people buy it. On the other side, a bitcoins value is based on how much you think it will go up in the future so you need a lot of new people thinking the same as you and buying in everyday to keep the price up.
That's pure speculative growth, and not actual value.

What? Btc is know for its' volatility, its obviously a characteristic and the reason no one wants to use it in real life except for speculators and dark net markets


@_date: 2018-04-25 05:26:57
You gotta bait everyone into the next bulltrap somehow, you know
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:13:56
I don't care about that, but if you think about it you will see its true: the ones who benefit the most are the creators/devs, then the first miners, then the buyers, then the bagholders, etc.
Literally a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:10:38
98% 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:54:56
You made the comparison not me, man
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:57:46
most of the folks here bought in December tho
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:28:36
It has
Its definitely not 8k or whatever the current price is tho
Incredibly overvalued, the tech is not even that good (that's why there's no mass adoption and even steam stopped accepting it, it's being used mostly to buy drugs, that's it) and it doesn't matter how you look at it, its value is speculative 
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:23:22
did it work?
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:53:25
What do you mean? I'm aware of bitcoin since it was 7 dollars, way before most of you here
It could go to 1M,  I don't care, I'm still right
