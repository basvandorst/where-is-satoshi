maaaan you old as shit. got that atlantis goin too ^ ^
i remember when i first started buying games on steam. the knee jerk reaction for me was "wtf where's my hard copy..i need the box. i need something i can hold" fast forward some years later now i'm damn glad i don't have to deal with the boxes. would be so much unnecessary clutter....

Wait. So the files were overwritten? There are programs that will let you dig in old data btw. Just because you can't see it via normal OS does not mean that the data is not still there. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:45:45
bookmarked teehee
@_date: 2014-01-11 10:14:09
It was easy and they shipped my item out fast x.O I didn't think it was going to be that quick and easy...
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:38:36
I don't think it's him at all. Who uses an online handle that close to their name? SPECIALLY when creating an anonymous currency x.O This poor guy.
Also if you think the media has made you with that much currency in your back pocket you're not staying around long to answer questions....
Satoshi if you're out there kick this man down some coins from the god wallet. Prove it's not you and help the man out.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:41:15
That's the one I've used in the past. Cheapest for the features you get and effective. Could try the demo....

Bitcoin is what smeagol is to precious. Doge is what Oprah is to cars...... 
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:56:05
heeelllo coinbase
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:44:23
down voted to hell but worth it for the few who got it..cheers!
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:38:54
I remember we narrowed this down to shoes. Criminals and terrorists use shoes and we must act to ban all shoes! Why hasn't there been any movement on this?!?! We must sacrifice our shoes for freedom!!

Yay bitcoins are on sale again :D So just a theoretical here: what happens when they announce that a company like Wells Fargo has bought the coins?
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:38:31
I..I..I don't know which way to go!
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:28:02
horrible response. i have plenty of cold i will not touch. im buying now to buy now. isn't that the whole idea behind the coin? that was the whole god damn sell feature........
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:04:59
i'll look up circle. it's just sad. is it not?
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:00:06
you sweet delicious fucks
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:42:39
lock in a price of BTC? blasphemy! :p the reason i said before the cold is untouchable is because they are priceless. as some have said before...will sell over my dead body :D thanks for the info btw
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:30:42
im not trying to hold. im trying to liquid..........
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:57:47
it's a transition atm. and no taking out of cold is not an option. what i'm trying to point out is that coinbase has taken a step backwards. trying to convert fiat to crypto shouldn't take so long. 
why would i want to take out of cold when i'm trying to convert now? it's feckin 2015 it should not be a process. again i'll point out that this is a step backwards for coinbase. here's my fiat...give me crypto.
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:27:28
there's other reasons too but you pretty much hit it straight on. my biggest gripe of this whole thing is within that...coinbase is regressing......
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:45:50
i do appreciate an actual response on reddit. that does mean something. don't get me wrong and here comes the BUT...i've had a linked account for probably 2 years now. why? why is the question. i'm 90% u can't give me a real answer because there's some internal reason :( you changed something....why
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:56:29
you do realize we can click on your name and see history right?
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:48:50
somehow i don't think he knows how bitcoin works
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:06:11
absolute bullshit floods our forum. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:24:49
that's weak at best
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:20:59
he talks shortcuts you talk reason. we have been flooded with this sort of short sided reasoning and i don't think it's a just short sided attack....
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:59:40
the understatement of all. just the ends and no mean.
@_date: 2016-10-11 07:43:02
trump up trickle down!
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:06:32
Business insider shit posting to try and buy cheaper BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:27:57
my buddy told me best a long time ago: "well if you sell right now you might end up just sittin there with your dick in the wind"
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:31:41
bitcoin died again yesterday
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:42:11
i've done it that way since even when i was sending peanuts
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:45:44
when u feel old in the crypto game. shit is cycling faster though is what i'm seeing. am i delusional?
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:16:34
same. "Uhhh uhhhh TERRORISM!!!" 
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:36:34
Thanks for your input and time. I guess 2014 is going to be a defining year for this sort of stuff x.O
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:43:48
people that wake up on the west are gonna think "wtf is this guy even talking about"
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:30:16
I live in an orange state YAY! The comments show just how ignorant people are :/ I still need to buy some coins....
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:51:39
Are we feeding the trolls now?
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:21:02
"One who posts a deliberately provocative message to a newsgroup or message board with the intention of causing maximum disruption and argument" 
I guess the troll part is the obvious fakeness behind the video in the first. It's gonna start a debate.
I guess a better way to describe this guy is a cheeseball angler. IF there is somebody causing real damage in the bitcoin community it would be in the interest of everybody to disclose who it is to protect others. It's just painefully obvious this guy is just angling for donations.
If this story is real he is putting others at risk by letting the so called offender still run a muck. If the story is fake he's gone to the depths of using his children to beg for donations. Either way OP is scum.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:46:05
Ugly troll or pretty troll...they both smell like dookie.
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:47:15
