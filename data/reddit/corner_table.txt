I think you missed the point. Economically tight-knit groups thrive when they support eachother and do use their money with the mindset "this is for the greater good of US".
So I'll give a real life example that I have experienced. I was at a national park with my gf and started talking with a family that we met there. Their kid (prob 10 or 11years old) saw my bitcoin shirt and started talking to me about mining and his raspberry pi and generally knew more about bitcoin than nearly every adult I've met. So I asked him if he owned any bitcoin and he said no so I offered to give him some. He downloaded a wallet on his mom's phone and I gave him .025btc($25 worth at the time).
The reason I decided to be altruistic and give him some bitcoin is because I knew that the .025 that I gave him might be the spark that lights the fire for the next generation of bitcoiners. It would be of much more value to him than it was to me, even if it went up in price.
Think of the x10 rule. For every person you give bitcoin to, they will go on and tell 10 more people about it. What might be dust to you is some serious skin in the game for others. Now this doesn't mean to give bitcoin to beggars, but if you see someone that is genuinely interested but doesn't own any, it is for the greater good of US to gift them some.

Sorry, should have worded that better. I need to write about the information given in the documentary. My professor said to just watch one documentary and write about it.

metcalfe's law. Market cap goes up with the amount of transactions squared.

Censorship is against bitcoin's values. Their argument for increasing the blocksize does have some merit.. lower fees, faster transactions. It really does make sense to increase the blocksize, even to 8MB. Especially with the increase in the transaction volume.

Even the Coinbase CEO sold his bitcoin and went all in on ETH. See how that worked out for him? Coinbase won't even  use segwit addresses and hasn't given their users their bcash.

"Regulation to allow growth" - Well that's an oxymoron.

Dude. Look at the jobs reports. There is a labor SHORTAGE. If you can't find a job in this market, then you need to look in the mirror and see whose fault it really is.

When will the noobs learn to HODL instead of selling the bottom?
