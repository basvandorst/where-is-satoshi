Mike - you live in Switzerland, which is one of the rare countries where the majority of participants (in a democratic election) **are** intelligent and well informed.

Jon Matonis is not saying that we should increase the 21M cap. He's saying that at some point in the future, someone will try and increase it. As many have pointed out - if this ever happens successfully, the value of bitcoin will be significantly destroyed. Jon Matonis is an early adopter and holds a large % of his wealth in bitcoin, so he is obviously opposed to increasing the size. Please understand the context of his words before making a premature judgement on what he means.

Hey that's a really good point! Yes I would do the same and I imagine everyone else would as well.

I do not see this as positive at all. Most of the report was positive, the below text was highly concerning. This is basically saying that there needs to be an entity responsible and in charge of bitcoin and that this entity would be regulated as a financial service. They are saying that without Bitcoin being regulated under control of an entity - bitcoin should not be allowed to interact with existing regulated financial services. That's a big problem.

Thanks regarding my argument. At first I also thought everyone would be running Bitcoin miners, but it has not gone that way.


Neither is Bitcoin mining. Consistently since nearly the beginning of Bitcoin's history - mining bitcoin has been less not profitable or at least less profitable than investing directly in the currency itself. The main people who can profit from mining have great access to either: electricity or hardware manufacturing (or both). 
If you can rent a warehouse in a place where electricity is subsidised by the state (or someone else) and then access fresh-off-the-fab ASICs then you can make money mining. I know a few people doing this, but it's not something everyone can do.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what "used" means. There's a lot of Gold in the world, but that Gold is mostly sitting, passively in vaults. Why then do humans spend loads of money to mine it from the ground, only to lock it up in a vault and never "use" it. They do this because it is a store of value. Bitcoin - same thing. Bitcoin's greatest use case is not necessarily it's abilities for payments on the internet, but for storage of long term value.

It's actually rather incredible that their government had a currency for 150 years without deciding to take it off the gold standard. I think the question is not "Why did the US go off the gold standard?" but instead "How did they go for 150 years without derailing from gold???"

I put all my money into bitcoin back in 2012, simply because it was easier to use than keeping in a bank. At the time volatility wasn't much of an issue and the price was slowly and steadily rising and so it worked out quite well. Vastly easier to move money between countries and whenever I needed fiat - localbitcoin was there for me to get electronic or paper fiat within an hour. It was not a hard decision, but one of the best ones I have made. Or perhaps - keeping it all in bitcoin throughout 2013 was the best. Either way...

This is not true. The US government controlls 144,000 of DPR's coins. The rest of his coins (DPR's net worth est. at 600k coins) are not being controlled by the US government as they were not able to access them. A big reason as to why the US couldn't auction those off as well is that DPR laid claim to them in the lawsuit. He didn't lay claim to the 29k coins because if he had, he would be admitting to various "crimes".

Same with bitcoin implementation - over time the cost of implementing bitcoin will go down and the benefits of implementing it will go up.

It's weird that people think Bitpay is damaging to the price of bitcoin. Bitpay is actually one of the major reasons why the price of bitcoin is so high today. After Wordpress and a few other major sites accepted bitcoin through bitpay in early 2013, the price started it's rise up to $100 (and then $250+). In the day-to-day yes bitpay is mostly selling large amounts of coins all the time, however so are miners and no one in their right mind would possibly accuse large mining farms of being bad for the bitcoin price, they are the ones securing the network. Without merchant processors that give the option of cashing 0-100% out into fiat, we would not see the price that we see today. 
However, yes we absolutely need more money to stay IN bitcoin rather than leave and it would be great if the merchant's supply chain could also accept bitcoin - but that will come in time of course. What do we need people to do to counterbalance the constant sell-off of miners and bitpay/coinbase? **Hoard of course!!** Hoarding is the only way bitcoin will succeed and the only reason why it has succeeded so far. There are people hoarding 6 figure stashes of bitcoin, some who have never sold a single coin. Without these true believers, the price would still be in the single-double digits. The more of you who hoard, the more we will solve this "problem" and create a full circle bitcoin economy.

I think the work that Bitcoin miners are doing is anything but wasteful. Proof of stake definitely brings something new, but it's not a order of magnitude improvement - in the way that the various previous cryptocurrencies were mostly vast improvements over each other. Also, paper money can be an order of magnitude more convenient than gold (even if it's centralisation = massive counter-party risk) and Bitcoin is similarly an order of magnitude great than paper (or electronic) money. Altcoins are not an order of magnitude greater than Bitcoin.

Especially for the growing number of freelancers and small online businesses - they cannot use cash to evade taxes and Bitcoin will make it easy as pie. 
Edit: What I am saying is that I think there will be a much higher % and also segments of the economy which are not currently evading tax (freelancers, middle class, etc).

**ELECTRUM FOR THE WIN!!!**
In all seriousness though - blockchain is trying to give you control of your own keys. Coinbase is trying to protect users from their own mistakes. **Electrum does both, extremely well**.
With electrum, you control your keys. With electrum, you can write down 12 words on a piece of paper - store than somewhere in your house, safe, etc, etc - and keep yourself "protected from your own potential failures". 
TL;DR: More people should store coins in Electrum

If I use a wallet purely for micropayments, I wouldn't care that much about whether they were solvent or not. If it's a wallet that I am only ever going to store $10 or $20 in, they could loose the keys and I wouldn't be tooo bummed.

When I buy stuff like Domain Names, SSL certs and that sort of thing I usually use namecheap.com and purchase them with bitcoin. It's just easier and faster than using a debit/credit card. 
Sometimes I buy flights from Cheapair.com. They are more expensive than purchasing them via debit/credit but I use bitcoin when I do not have enough fiat for the flight. Since I usually keep most of my savings in bitcoin, this has meant that the last several flights I have purchased have been done in bitcoin.

I think that Satoshi probably has a bunch of coins which he bought in the early days and is probably living off of that stash. 


Larry Paige and Sergey Brin probably also feel like the success of Google and the internet and android were nice rewards, but I do feel like they completely deserve to be billionaires.
Bitcoin however is an invention on a scale which goes far beyond the likes of Google, Facebook or any silicon valley startup - it's more akin to the invention of democracy, the printing press or language. If bitcoin is what I believe it to be, it will change the human condition in a similar way to the entire internet or the invention of agriculture. If Satoshi's net worth becomes $100 billion or whatever - so be it. He deserves that. 
As for me, I'm just looking forward to see what he does with it. A man as smart as that could put it to some great uses.

Taxes is a relatively small part of the demand for the US Dollar (I would say "fiat currencies" but in reality, there is only one reserve currency). Demand for oil is a huge part, possibly the majority of the demand for the US Dollar. This is why I think dollars are **also speculative and quite possibly in a bubble**. I would be happy to be proven wrong since I do business in fiat currencies, but I will continue to hold bitcoin as my main store of value.

I have no opinion as to whether gold is or isn't in a bubble right now. However I do know that it is used primarily as store of value (not method of payment), which was the reason I picked it as an example.
Whether Gold is in a bubble is an entirely separate matter. Whether it is a "good" store of value is also an entirely separate matter. I picked it as an example because Gold is "useful" even while sitting a vault somewhere. Same is true for bitcoin. Either can be in a bubble or not - that's irrelevant.

AFAIK - there are no companies/exchanges/services that will send bitcoin on the blockchain without a fee. They might internalise that fee and not charge it to the user, but the fee still exists.

It's annoying when people make comments like this. If colored coins were implemented in a way that solves a problem for people - they would be solving that problem.

Wait, but Gavin's scalability roadmap is regarding nodes right - not miners. I want to believe you that the storage/bandwidth costs falling will prevent bitcoin transaction costs from rising too much (and hopefully in the future they will fall) but I am worried that every increasing amounts of capital will be chasing the block rewards and that as the block rewards fall, miners will demand higher fees.

Yes. Bitcoin in my view isn't a currency *yet*. I like the comment someone made today, calling it a "candidate currency". That's fairly accurate. Another way to see it is as a commodity or as the first / most successful digital commodity. It's really a new asset class. 3% is huge, but this is the early days so...makes sense that it would be 3%. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:33:33
Not true. If I hold USD I am expecting a certain amount of inflation per year. If I am a shareholder in the Fed, I'm expecting a 6% return per year. If I own a house, I may expect the value to go up or down, maybe I will develop that house and it might double in value, etc. However a great portion of bitcoin holders are expecting the value of bitcoin to go up several orders of magnitude. This is different from most other assets. It's almost like shares in a startup in terms of the expected potential value, except that it's a liquid asset which "anyone" can technically invest in and there's no company.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:35:43

No kidding. Wow BIP-38 + knowing the right method of alignment, etc  =  that's probably the most compact, secure and transportable method of liquid wealth storage in the world. If someone were to ask the question: how should I move $10,000 or $10m out of a regime with capital controls - this would be simply the best way to do it. And it would fit right in your wallet and potentially could be backed up to multiple levels of redundancy. This is what makes bitcoin unique. This is what makes bitcoin an incredible invention.

Lol. It's definitely not unlimited risk. Have you heard of margin calls? Every exchange which allows short selling has implemented margin calls because exchanges hold no collateral and use calls to stop out someone's position once it has come close to zero. 
You have the same limit on your risk with shorting as with buying bitcoin: the value of your investment goes to $0.
Now that might be more likely to happen if you are shorting vs buying, but your risk is certainly still limited.

Sorry and thank you for correcting me. What I should've said is that bitcoin's path will either go one of two directions: to the eventual $0 point or the eventual 6-7 figure point. I don't believe there is a future option where bitcoin ends up hanging out in the middle somewhere forever.
I would say that the current price is based on the risk/reward of bitcoin reaching it's eventual 6-7 figure target at this stage in the adoption cycle. It's also probably based on the ease of entry/exit, which I would say at this point is low (meaning hard to enter/exit).

I disagree. I think that the *vast majority* of bitcoin's value comes as an asset for the long term storage of value, not a payment system. Just look at the velocity of bitcoin transactions - it's tiny. Today bitcoin is most useful for "hodling". One day it might be mostly used for payments, but I doubt that will ever happen. I think payments will continue to be a minority use case, although a very important one.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:29:13


This is not true. Most of the time the average (especially as mining has been getting more competitive) the time between blocks is less than 10 minutes, often the average over a period has gotten as low as 9 or even 8 minutes. This is because the difficulty only adjusts every 2 weeks and so any power added in during that 2 week period speeds up the block times. This is the reason why bitcoin has been inflating far faster than the scheduled rate of inflation.

Misconception. There's a difference between [Blockchain](blockchain.info) and The Bitcoin Blockchain. The first is a company that has an open source, javascript e-wallet which doesn't have access to users' funds. The second is the bitcoin network's public ledger.

Yes the volatility has gone down as the market cap goes up. Also, more exchanges, more liquidity across exchanges, etc has helped with volatility. More sophistication in financial products (futures, options, etc) will also decrease volatility.

What evidence do we have of this?
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:58:32
The difference is settlement. With Gold - settlement is expensive and so if a platform for trading Gold is hesitant or difficult with redemptions, they have an excuse. With bitcoin if a platform/exchange is delaying BTC withdrawals, you know something is terribly wrong.

Believe me, everything about Bitcoin is in the early stages. It works really well for individuals but the fact of the matter is that there is no good enterprise solution for Bitcoin just yet - thus all the exchanges closing down withdrawals. There's a vast array of software that needs to be built in and around bitcoin and when it is - the traditional finance systems will adopt it like crazy.

I personally would like to see (in several years) him cash out some portion of those coins. Doing so would require him to give up his anonymity, which would potentially be a life-risking event.

I was going to be annoyed by your comment, but I can see how you misunderstood my comment. I know that Bitstamp has a compliance department. I was saying that Bitcoin needs a compliance department (according to the implications of what the EBA is saying in the quoted text). I am not trying to spread FUD. Bitstamp is fine, I think they're perfectly legal with European law (not US law, but that's a separate matter). I was referring to Bitcoin not being a company with a compliance department.

@_date: 2014-01-05 18:23:48
As the price rises - there will be more things to cash out into, as more people will be seeking to benefit from the wealth created in bitcoin. Also, as there are more things to cash out into, Bitcoin will become more valuable, in the same way that the NYSE being the most liquid stock exchange means that it is the most valuable way for people to "Cash Out" of their equities. The USD is the most valuable currency mostly because if you need to "Cash Out" of oil, you will use USD. (Thus everyone purchasing Oil must also purchase USD).

@_date: 2014-10-11 22:45:02
I disagree with you, but you are also missing my point. I was saying "there's less access to credit" which means that it's harder to borrow BTC, not referring to the lending aspects. I agree that directly/voluntarily/consciously lending BTC is probably easier, however with fiat anytime I hold fiat in a bank, it is lent out - which means a crap-ton of credit for people who are looking to borrow fiat. 
Edit: btw this may change in the future, I'm just describing the way things are today.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:37:28
And yet everyone directs their hate towards MtGox rather than the US Federal Mobsters. I also would say that Coinlab is most likely partially to blame in the whole MtGox fiasco. It's highly likely Peter V. was involved in getting their US banking relations damaged. 
I am not saying MtGox is entirely blame-free, just that there are a number of parties to blame. In the end it's both a sad thing that they have been damaged, but also a good thing as it forces the bitcoin ecosystem to become stronger.

The internet, globalisation, much more efficient capital markets, prevalence of fiat currency systems, highly connected social networks (social media), and other factors all mean that technological innovations can spread much more quickly. Gold also gained value as humans became wealthier (there was less wealth 6000 years ago) whereas bitcoin will gain value from an existing wealthy humanity moving assets into bitcoin.

21 Inc won't need to worry too much about transaction fees when:
1. They own a large % of the network (as a mining pool)
2. The senders and receivers of the payments are within 21 Inc's network. 
Example: Joe is sending 0.01 BTC from his TV to Netflix to pay for a show. Netflix is either a customer of 21 Inc and thus on their network, or Netflix recognises the payment as some sort of "greenlisted" 21Inc-related payment and can accept it as a Zero-Conf / Zero-Fee payment. Then in the next block that 21 Inc mines, 21 Inc includes it in their batch even though it has no fee.

I found several resume's in the directory - but who knows if those are real or not and even still, most are large organisations.

Sure. If an investor is feeling to heavily invested into bitcoin, they should hedge by buying non-bitcoin assets, such as stock market index ETFs, Gold, etc. In my view (and the view of the above linked Nakamoto articles) either bitcoin will win, or cryptocurrencies will lose. There is one coin and it will rule them all.

1. Buy Bitcoin
2. Talk about it with your friends in casual everyday conversations. Don't push it on them. Don't bring it up every time you see them. Just tell them why you are buying/investing time and money into bitcoin.

I love how everyone **actually** believes that someone bought SatoshiDice from Erik Voorhees. You can still bet using the SatoshiDice addresses. There is no secure way to completely transfer ownership of those private keys. Any potential new owner would need to trust that Erik deleted any backups he had of the private keys. Furthermore, the buyer would need to own 125k BTC. There's a very small number of people who at that point in time, owned that many bitcoin. Highly unlikely that any of them would have "cashed out" for a site like Satoshidice.
In my view, it's much more likely that Erik himself bought back the shares from all public stockholders on MPEx and basically took the site private so he could renounce his affiliation to the poker site. Shortly after the sale, he moved to the US.

Well they have way more than $25m and considering that with their first 1-2 million users, they attracted a $458m valuation - I'm sure they wouldn't mind paying $25m to potentially attract a valuation that is $100-500m higher than their last valuation. I'm not saying this is logical, they won't earn their $25m back, but in the VC-funded mentality, it makes sense.

**Are blockchain.info and Coinbase.com's wallet user  inflated?**
Here's something to take into consideration. Any investor that is "long bitcoin" has an incentive in inflating the number of bitcoin users if they want to make adoption seem like it's growing faster than it is. Any of these investors can either program, or hire a programmer, a script that would automatically create massive numbers of wallets on both of these websites. If the systems of these 2 companies prohibit this type of mass wallet generation (both companies have incentives not too, but ignoring that fact for now) then the investors could hire people in India, China, etc to do this at an internet cafe. 
The thing is that anyone could have this incentive. So even if Coinbase and Blockchain.info are extremely trustworthy and are not manipulating numbers - any of their customers might be. I think the real # of bitcoin users is still around 1-5 million, but it's super hard to say.

If you deal with the fiat world, you need to collect data on your user. Otherwise you can lose the money or be implicated in a crime. If you deal with bitcoin only, you don't. This is the reason bitcoin exchanges have to do AML/KYC - they are bridging the gap between fiat and bitcoin. Once people are in this new world of BTC, they can use Seals With Clubs or Coinapult or whatever all they want without giving away their identity.

I haven't delved into the technicals of either OpenBazaar or this new project (Drop Zone), but from what I have seen so far, this sounds much more exciting than OpenBazaar. The devs at OB remain adamant that "selling drugs on OpenBazaar would be stupid" and are not focussed on the drug market at all, despite the massive, massive potential for that use case. This guy seems focussed on the drug market straight from the get go and that is wonderful. People should be laser focussed and the reason for Silk Road's success was because they were laser focussed on creating an internet based drug market. This guy seems to 1. be fully aware of the dangers of centralised (Evolution, Silk Road, etc) marketplaces, especially when dealing with contraband and 2. 100% focussed on solving that problem. 
I love it. Good luck and godspeed to Miracle Max and all the developers who follow in his footsteps and aid this effort. May the free market thrive and freedom reign.

the advice of the people here is fairly solid advice. I would add, don't invest until you have an extremely solid understanding and basis for why you believe that bitcoin will be more valuable in the future. Bitcoin is still going to be volatile for years to come and if you have a solid understanding, you won't sell at a loss or too early. If bitcoin delivers on it's greatest potential, you won't need to sell out for traditional currency.

There are a few ways the question of Satoshi is (unfortunately) relevant to bitcoin, both as an asset/currency and as a technology. 
**Asset Related**: If he resurfaces, the question that comes to mind is: Will he sell his coins and crash the market? What's his endgame?
More importantly / also asset related: Satoshi has done something that many have been killed/jailed for, which is to fight against the US Dollar and reign of fiat money. He also owns 1 million bitcoin, the ultimate "bearer asset". The question here is: Who will try to kill him first governments or criminal organisations? If he was killed, the price should arguably rise significantly as the supply of total bitcoin will have contracted immensely. 
**Technology Related**: Many open source technologies have a [BDFL]( or a Benevolent Dictator for Life. Right now Gavin Andresen is certainly a candidate for eventually being bitcoin's BDFL, however Satoshi is the "God", "Jesus" or "Neo" figure in religious aspect of bitcoin and so if he returned he would have immense sway over technological chances in bitcoin, from a hearts-and-minds perspectives. 
I think Satoshi is very likely Nick Szabo. Hopefully Nick Szabo is also a pseudonym, but I do know several people who have known Nick personally for 20+ years, so it would have had to be a longstanding pseudonym. We'll see what happens, but I hope for his sake that he doesn't reveal his identity and also that he never posts anything ever again. However, as many have pointed out previously - if he ever wants to cash out his massive bitcoin wealth, he will inevitably give up his identity (to at least one other person) since bitcoin is not anonymous.

Hi Johnny,
The main benefit I saw in Xapo was that it is a US-focused company jurisdictionally-based outside of the US and focussed on being a bitcoin bank ("Swiss bank for bitcoin" as Winces said). The fact that you are now looking to be a "US-based money services business" is really disappointing. Looks like Winces was right about the Switzerland analogy, the same US-government that pillaged the privacy of accounts in Swiss banks seems to have pillaged the privacy of accounts at Xapo - despite the jurisdictional setup in Hong Kong, Bermuda, etc, etc. 
Also there are major questions about your "insurance" offering. Xapo is "self-insured" through a captive insurance company, but we have no idea what the assets of Xapo or the captive are. How much of the $40m has been spent? How many bitcoins are being held? Without knowing Xapo's exact assets and how many bitcoins are on deposit, it's impossible to know the true value of Xapo's "insurance" offering.

SDICE has remained as untied as possible to the real world identity and I believe they are not paying taxes. The Public P&amp;L Google Doc sheet used to be online and isn't anymore, but if taxes were paid it would have shown up there and I never saw anything about it.
ASICMiner? Although there is a real man behind "Friedcat", I doubt the PRC government has made the connection and are taxing him. Certainly possible, I just doubt it. 
Another example is everyone who has made capital gains in bitcoin either from mining or buying - are they paying taxes? Not for the most part...

Bitcoin's exchange right now is gotten from MtGox, which is loosing market share.

I personally doubt it. They don't have much to gain from doing this (other than a pump and dump scheme). Also Litecoins are vastly more susceptible to a 51% attack, as any altcoin is, by virtue of having far less hashing power strengthening the chain. The guys involved in Gox know this and would not risk a large theft of their coin reserves due to a possible 51% attack. Another altcoin (I forgot which one) has already had a 51% attack, and with Litecoin I imagine it would not be impossible to execute one as well - especially if they became more liquid.

This is where the west will not understand what China does until it is done. The western world and western governments are motivated by very different things and work in different ways than China. China has - in some shape or form - been around for +5000 years. The government will not be afraid to sell it's dollar reserves at some point and trade away that financial loss for a power gain. This is actually a trade-off which governments are quite willing to make often. Loosing money, but gaining power. What happens next will be very interesting and I don't think anyone will be able to predict it!

So to obtain bitcoins anonymously a person merely needs to use Localbitcoin and not put any personal data on the site. If a person wants to be extra careful, they should use the Localbitcoin site through TOR. 
After that it's relatively easy because the bitcoins you own have not yet been traced. A mixing service such as Silk Road or eventually ZeroCoin can be utilised for protecting a person's privacy and using it anonymously.

After I bought my first Bitcoin (prices were in the single digits), I used the system and then went all in.
For the last year I have held all of my money in Bitcoin aside from whatever I needed for the next 7-15 days (sometimes more, at most 30). This has worked out relatively well for the most part, cashing out on Localbitcoin as needed, holding among price rises and drops. It's helped me become more prudent with my money, save more and spend less, especially during the value increases. I plan on keeping all of my wealth for the next 5 years in either: 
* Bitcoin 
* Bitcoin securities/startups
Currently I my salary is paid in Fiat but by the end of the year I am expecting that 100% of my salary and 80-90% of my spending will take place in Bitcoin. I expect that within 5-10 years Bitcoin will be one of a number of currencies that exist after the USD looses it's status as the de-facto reserve currency. I expect Google, Facebook and other companies to create their own currencies after the collapse of the USD, but I think Bitcoin will of course have significant advantages over those. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 09:05:53
If you do a simple comparison of [Bitcoin's volume in China]( with the volume in the [west]( you'll see that around 55% of the total volume is China/HK based. This should be enough of an answer to people who are worried about the US government cracking down. It's a good sign in many ways.

Most Billionaires keep very little of their wealth in USD or other fiat currencies. They keep wealth in:
* Shares of companies
* Hedge funds (which invest the money with specific strategies)
* Land, properties/real-estate 
* Gold/silver/precious-metals
* Etc
Billionaires rarely keep (most) of their money in USD/fiat. Keep in mind that for someone to be a millionaire or billionaire, their "net worth" must be over $1M or $1Bn in market value. If I own 718.50 ounces of Gold then I am a millionaire in USD standards - however none of my assets are in USD.

I may be an anarchist/ancap but I also realise that there is a strategy involved in dealing with governments and that at present we do need to deal with governments.

If the (or an) economy is denominated in Bitcoin - then taxes will either:
*  not exist
*  be payable in bitcoin as well
Every economy or ecosystem that exists only within the bitcoin ecosystem does not usually pay tax (SatoshiDICE, ASICMiner, Silk Road, etc) and if the economy switched to bitcoin, the chance that everyone would be voluntarily paying taxes while using something that was semi-anonymous? Very low...

Open source is a really great idea, but it's important to remember that it is not universally applicable to everything and that there are areas where open source software can succeed and areas/projects that are OSS/FOSS that do not succeed.
Bitcoin and Linux succeed because they are something that a vast number of developers have worked on (payment system and OS) and those developers will save time by contributing to a collective project rather than re-inventing the wheel.
However an exchange is a technology that far fewer developers have the task of working on and the ones who do are usually paid a hansom fee for implementing them. Exchange and high speed trading software generally goes for $100-500k or even much higher and is implemented by a far smaller number of people than those who have to install an OS or implement a payment system. 
Nothing wrong with FOSS - it's just not the best thing for everything.

They didn't get their bank account frozen because of bitcoin. I don't think either of those exchanges had the proper financial registrations and licenses to operate a FOREX exchange. Most likely they just had a business bank account, which is completely inadequate for this. They might not have been registered with Canada's FINTRAC, but they probably didn't have the necessary MSB or FOREX or whatnot license.
This most likely has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Anyone with some level of intelligence who has worked before and dealt with banks and fiat currency before will have felt the pain points of those systems and if they are at all levelheaded they can realise that a democratic, egalitarian system which removes human error is far better than the system that caused 2008 to happen.

It does not violate any such "Law". Spot Price (real gold) vs ETC/Comex price (paper gold) have recently diverged. Price divergence is normal, especially when there is a shift in the ability of a person to access the fundamental derivative that the investment/asset is based on.
When a person can no longer access the underlying USD that MtGOX-USD is based on, then there is a change in the price of MtGOX-USD vs other USD. That happens frequently in all sorts of markets.

In the future, people will not be sending all transactions to the main blockchain, the transaction fees would increase too much. We will probably see many large companies that start massive mining rigs and charge no fees in order to help their TX processing) but I think a more likely scenario is off-chain transactions are going to become used for the mainstream. For example if you have ever sent Bitcoin from one MtGox account to another, you'll notice that the coins immediately show up, there's 0 delay - this is because the transaction was probably an off-chain transaction and never hit the network, which it doesn't need too. 
Bitcoin means diversity, decentralisation and complete freedom. [Bitcoincard]( for example will allow for non-internet based transactions.

I put 95% of my net worth into Bitcoin when the price was $12. I personally don't regret that decision. Has it been stressful to keep 90-95% of my net worth in it ever since? Yes, but overall it's been a great investment - not only financially but morally I feel better about keeping value in something that does not support the centralisation of violence.
I know people who have millions and tens of millions of dollars invested in BTC. I know companies, hedge funds, HNWI and VC firms which hold significant amounts of BTC. This is something that can completely change the world and the ability of any party to shut it down is near 0 and decreasing rapidly as the ASIC mining industry is developing.

America is not as relevant as many people think. Bitcoin does not need to be massively adopted in the US, it has already been massively adopted elsewhere and will continue to be. Also  even if Americans don't consciously understand QE, they feel the effects of inflation and a fiat banking/currency system. If you ask an american "What is one thing you hate about banks/banking?" I can guarantee you everyone will have a few things to complain about - modern banking is just a slow, problematic system.

Doubling money value every 4 years? This is completely possible...
Angel investors and VCs regularly expect a 10x return in 3 years from their investments, many of the investments turn to 0, but the ones that succeed usually do 10x or better in that timespan.
Many stocks and whatnot have delivered a more than doubling in 4 years.
There is no bitcoin company or manager promising or telling anyone anything, so bitcoin is definitely not a scam - just an early stage, high risk, high tech asset/technology. It will either be many orders of magnitude larger or valued at close to 0 in a few years.

This wouldn't be possible. Obviously it would be impossible practically to convince this many people to buy all at once, but more than that - long time holders wouldn't sell their coins. Satoshi most likely holds 1 Million BTC and several people own 6 figure amounts of BTC and these people would not give that up easily. 
The market cap of bitcoin is $1.2 Bn and if that much was invested on bitcoin markets in one day than the price would double instantly but that would not mean that 11 million BTC would have been sold.

Yep that's a problem that can happen. I'm too lazy to find the link right now, but MtGox has claimed that they do not do this - I think they probably aren't doing this, it would expose them to too much "volatility risk" and would be an extremely dangerous thing to do. There's also ways to protect against this using the open accounting that bitcoin offers, although sometimes that means sacrifices in privacy. All I am saying is that bitcoin is limitless in the ways people can use it.

Put whatever percentage of your net worth you are comfortable with into Bitcoins. Post a localbitcoin.com advert and buy/sell to people in the area. As often as you can, use bitcoin when economically interacting with others. Look into having your employer pay you in bitcoin and if you rent, talk to your landlord about accepting bitcoin.
I've lived for the last year almost entirely off of profits I've made in the bitcoin economy which I convert into fiat to pay rent. Once I get my landlord to accept BTC, then 90%+ of my economic interactions will take place in the world of bitcoin.

Hi Olaf. Just a recommendation, it's probably not a good idea to allow purchase/sale of coins on a 24/7 hour basis if you do not have either:
* People who are awake 24/7 and can respond to problems.
* Alerts setup with the server so that if the system fails for a certain amount of time, then the server calls the engineer's phone. You can set this up so that it alternates which engineer to call based on the day of the week.

Talk to Tony from Bitpay or Roger Ver, they'll be able to broker/arrange a deal for you. Like I said, this isn't that hard of a thing to do, if you dedicate some time to a strategy, you should be able to buy this amount of coins in less than a week, depending on how movable your USD are.

This is flawed. For the most part, Banks don't hate bitcoin - in fact they don't give a crap about BTC - they just review accounts monthly and if they see "money laundering" going on, they will shut the bank account down if it does not have the necessary regulations. That's most likely the case for Bitfloor's accounts and it was definitely the case for Intersango and for the 2 Canadian exchanges that just shut down.
For the most part banks and governments don't care about bitcoin yet. They just care about money laundering and so if you are operating an exchange, you'll need to get full fiat-world legal licensing for whatever jurisdiction you are in - or get accounts shut down after 30 days.

People need to relax and understand the situation. This has nothing to do with bitcoin. This has everything to do with AML (Anti Money Laundering) regulations and registration with Canada's FINTRAC. AFAIK neither of these exchanges were registered with FINTRAC and probably did not have legal licenses necessary to operate a Forex or MSB business. If a bank sees an unusually high number of transactions going in and out with seemingly no commonalities, that bank will close the account/s. This is quite simple. 
Bitfloor, Intersango, etc, etc are all similar examples of this sort of thing. MtGox even was refused a UK bank as they did not have the proper legal licenses to operate a UK bank. 
If there weren't these regulations in place, we would have bitcoin exchanges all over the world. Banks/governments for the most part don't care about bitcoin yet, at all.

What I am saying is that it will eventually be possible to receive a $100,000 transaction with 0 confirmations as there is software that can detect double spends in real time. When this software becomes open source (as opposed to proprietary as it is now) then we won't need to wait for confirmations.

If you are storing any large (whatever you define as large) amount:
* Any (I mean any) passphrase you design yourself for a brainwallet is going to be crackable
* Electrum has a 12 word seed which uses 168 bits of entropy, that's vastly uncrackable and for holding that much money - how hard is it really to memorise 12 words? Store 'em in bank safes or somewhere really weird if you can't remember them.

The sheer number of factual inaccuracies in this article is astounding. Why are people upvoting this? Is it because it has a picture of the NASDAQ building on it? There was no confirmation that $150M of coin were purchase - that could have just been 1 user moving funds between 2 addresses that he owned.

The payment mechanism disrupts the banks
The currency disrupts the governments
Basically bitcoin threatens the two most powerful groups on earth and does it in a way that cannot be effectively shut down. That is why it's badass and that is why everything will be changed.

At certain times the volumes traded in China outpace those traded everywhere else in the world. You can find a good comparison [here]( There's a huge amount of trading happening in Russia (15% of trade happens in Russia right now) and of course Europe is huge, with Germany, Netherlands, Finland, UK, Iceland, etc all being huge countries for Bitcoin. The US...is a place for some cool bitcoin companies, but Bitcoin will never be a "mostly/majority American" thing.

"The best part of that system is you can sort out the ones that are truly greedy little morons, and the ones who have more noble intentions." Exactly! If someone is making loads of money selling bitcoin 5% over market price, then you can just undercut them and their "greed" will no longer be rewarded :)
If they are getting away with 5% over - then if all parties are informed, no one is being wronged.

I talked to a restaurant owner about why he accepted Bitcoin once. His explanation was extremely simple "By using this app (it was blockchain.info) I have people show up at my door all the time and pay me money, why wouldn't I want that?"
I love merchants like this - I hope he still kept the coins, he'll be super grateful if he did :)

That would be true except that even rich people/companies struggle with this. Thus I use "using money" and don't specify whether rich or poor.
It's certainly easier for the rich, but some things are still impossible.

Highly unlikely if Bitcoin succeeds past the next 6 months to 1 year. A group of "rogue miners" currently would need $40-400M to pull off a 51% attack, but in the next 6months-1 year that will go up by several orders of magnitude most likely.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:12:07
Yes, this is because 10-20% of all Bitcoin are probably destroyed, forever and then 40-50% is held by 20-50 people.
@_date: 2013-08-25 23:17:31
In the last three years, it has gone up 1000x or 10x every single year. There is no sign of that slowing down and even if the price only went up 10 or 100x in the next 10 years, that would be well over enough to make up for the block halving. 
Moore's law could be said to be "just not possible" and yet it happens, consistently - the only time it slows down is before another paradigm shift in computing. I am not trying to say that Bitcoin will continue doing 10x every year (although that would be wonderful for my portfolio) but I will say that it's possible for the next few years at least.
@_date: 2013-09-13 07:50:56
This is great except that I would put some sort of mixing/splitting of addresses because I probably would not want my "savings" to be in one address. but yeah this is a really cool idea, good job :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:33:34
Yeah in Part 1 section vi it defines "Large Company" and it seems pretty clear that MtGox is a large company - so I would say that on a cursory glance you do seem to be correct - this could be another reason why the banks are not allowing them to do large numbers of transactions.
Regarding the 52,400BTC - agreed I think they probably have a large portion of that left, possibly more in BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-13 00:57:39
Within jurisdictions this will happen. So for example the US might eventually modernise their banking and setup a RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlment) system similar to the UK's. The EU's SEPA is pretty good (next day or 3 days and usually cheap) but it might get better as well. However stuff like EU to US or UK to South Africa or Japan to China will almost always be slow - because international wire transfers have to go through several clearing banks (A central bank, then the Bank of International Settlements and then another central bank, etc) and that'll always take a long time. Ease of use is only one feature of bitcoin and if central banks keep the printing presses running and the currency controls/confiscation keeps happening then it'll be a relatively unimportant feature compared to the impossibility of confiscation/inflation that bitcoin has.
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:49:25
You could also use the money to:
* Feed the people in Satoshi Forest
* Build something in the forest?
* Hold the BTC for appreciation in value (although the value may end up going down or stagnating)
Of the choices you presented, I would vote for A. You rock man!!

Are you kidding? He's not worried at all. The only reason IMHO why the shares are "down" in price is investors are thinking short term and are afraid of the dividend decreases - which are happening because he is bringing in funds for the next batch/release in september and such.

No, like I said they have not actually attacked bitcoin itself. Liberty Reserve, Dwolla/Mitum Sigilum, etc - these things are all NOT bitcoin. We have yet to see a single government anywhere on earth actually make an attack on bitcoin. All they've done is attack institutions for holding fiat currencies, which in the end will only weaken fiat currencies. 
This is actually the strength of cryptography and bitcoin, they can spend all the resources they want to, but in the end they are just weakening themselves and not accomplishing anything. "No amount of violence will solve a math problem" - Jacob Appelbaum.

In order for all those people to be able to use bitcoin, we need vastly greater amounts of hoarding going on. We also need more bitcoin-economy spending as well, but hoarding is what will really bring access to the vast majority of the world.

Why do people think that just because they had $5m stolen from the US Gov, they are somehow running fractional reserve? This is a company that collects an overage of 1% combined trade fee and has processed well over $1 Billion. Also they have probably kept some of their earnings in BTC and been a long term investor, so I highly doubt that they somehow do not have every single dollar that users have deposited in them. This is purely a banking problem - their bank is only allowing them to do a certain number of transactions per day.

Doubling + Moores law + A brilliant core dev team which is working hard on scalability issues = I don't think it'll be a significant problem for the miners.

I hate to question that data, but I will. Only a small minority of the people who actually use Bitcoin took that pole, furthermore I do not for one moment believe that the Bitcointalk forums are a good sample size for bitcoin users in terms of interest distribution. Also, "Anarchism/Libertarianism" were not included in this survey, which I think are really important reasons and "cryptography enthusiast" is different from "privacy" and BOTH are different from "anonymity". 
Bitcoin is private by default, can be anonymous with technical knowledge and configuration, but "private" and "anonymous" are two very different things.

You give the government far too much credit. It's not as organised and cohesive as you make it out to be, the government does not have a soul and it cannot "hate". It's only power is to slow processes, destroy things and provide inefficient services. There will be no war because of the simple truth "No amount of violence can solve a math problem" and thus whatever they do, they'll only be able to act in their world, the world of Fiat currencies. They can wage fiat wars all they want, all it does is bring down the value of fiat by proving that fiat can easily be stolen, seized and shut down. As of yet, they've never actually attacked bitcoin itself - no one has.

Perhaps it limited the speed of the crash, however the crash happened and price is fully corrected by now (it's been months, enough time for anyone to get their money out). But yes MtGox being the only centralised exchange means that capital control (non-governmental) can happen.
Also, don't be tooo harsh on MtGox, a big chunk of it is their fault and another chunk is the fiat banking system's inefficiencies.

Hmm you don't completely understand what I'm trying to say. Yes it's certainly possible that if the NSA was listening in on a TOR node and then did a MITM (man in the middle attack) or some other attack, they could somehow obtain your IP address or perhaps even the email you used to login to Localbitcoin. However EVEN if they were able to do all that and discern that yes at X date you bought Y bitcoins from some other random guy online with Z amount of cash, they would not be able to know what you did with the coins after that. That would require them to compromise every aspect of Localbitcoin and then every aspect of every single other service you use your bitcoins with. 
It's just like tracking cash. VERY difficult. Not entirely impossible in some cases, but extremely difficult. Also - perhaps it's not such a good idea to use the same email for personal or work stuff (traceable to your identity) as the email you use to sign up for services (make that not traceable to your identity). 
Here's a few pieces of evidence for you to chew on:
* Silk Road is still running. DPR has not been caught yet. 
* Despite the high number of centralised exchanges, loads of people have never declared capital gains taxes on bitcoin appreciation - despite having made (in USD denominations) 6, 7, 8 and even 9 figure sums in the bitcoin world.
* At various times, half or more than half (currently it's probably a little less than half) the Bitcoin transactions are based around online gambling. The US is vehemently against online gambling and yet Americans are still able to use all sorts of online gambling things via bitcoin. 
So yes it might be possible to track some things. However when being careful, it's vastly harder to track than cash, cards or any other form of transacting value. Bitcoin has the same advantages that asymmetric cryptography has and thus tracing/tracking it's usage is like asymmetric warfare - a battle where the person defending their privacy has an infinitely easier time than the person attacking the privacy.

Bitcoin has already hit $91.26. In fact it's hit $98.50 on Bitfloor and on Localbitcoins.com it has hit $105. We are effectively at a $1Billion market cap it's just that MtGOX is slow, inefficient and takes forever to verify new customers and moving money into Japan/MtGOX takes forever as well. Congrats guys, we've reached $1Billion dollar valuation!
