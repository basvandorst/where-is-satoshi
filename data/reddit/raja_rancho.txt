They also use this alien method called the metric system. I swear if everyone could civilize as fast as Amurica we'd all be happy
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:52:31
then they put their 401K's and lose them and suddenly this is all just a risk taking stupid community of free market anarchists

Wait, so bcash and ripple and other currencies that have LN open it for one off transactions? Ripple transactions are 0.02 xmr (or 0.01?), how're they doing that? Something doesn't match up. 
Edit: also maybe try focussing on explaining this kinda stuff (why increased block size and LN promote centralisation, which I honestly haven't understood yet either) to newbies instead of useless mudslinging which is just hurting the community at this point.

Buddy bitcoin is teeny bit bigger than America. Thank god for that too. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:19:35
Just get some marketing and PR guys on board man you guys should be fine but yeah normies need to be made aware of stuff like this if anyone is dreaming of taking this whole gig to its logical end. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:26:25
That would have happened at the $8k dip, or even the $13500 dip a couple days ago. It's way beyond that point friend. Now dips mean people rush in to buy, bringing it back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:50:10
Can anyone please tell me in simple words so I can understand and forward it along if someone asks me?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:11:23
Thanks I think I sort of get it. So LN is something that the bitcoin community has to come to a consensus on? Can't you open a connection for a one time big purchase and close it when the transaction is done if it turns out to be cheaper over all? Are there security issues in applying LN to the bitcoin block chain?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:27:19
I'm just hoping merely having the law will stop him from doing that lol otherwise we're screwed.

Thanks man that really clears it up for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:40:24
Its not that simple but if you HAD to boil it down and answer that I'd say the money was never there in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:21:44
It's not a bubble. Until people's trust in the currency remains, the value will remain, which is pretty much how currencies work. Bubbles happen due to faults of the middlemen, like banks and financial institution. It may crash due to manipulative practices by holders of huge quantities or some other reason, but a classic bubble of over inflated value seen in traditional economic structures is just not applicable here. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:11:12
Man tbh this was the biggest impediment in me buying it over the years. When it was $7 i was like maybe ill get some and order things off Silk Road when i get my pay, when it hit $100 i was like whatever i can't afford a full bitcoin this month anyway, and the price of a full btc never went into affordable range ever since. I really feel the 'bit' part wasn't advertised at it should have been.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:22:49
Is it near ATH? It's on a dip at $14.5k at this moment. It's actually a brilliant idea to take it in btc right now, convert some to USD, and keep some for their lunar trip.

SPOILER 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:18:02
can people stop repeating what everyone else is saying without checking? btc fees has been like 2.5 dollar for me for the past few weeks. yeah sure youd spend 20 to take your btc out oif exchanges. stop using exchanges then 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:09:50
you cant manipulate the blockchain even with 8 billion. id think owning 51% nodes, mounting an attack on the 51% nodes or even just decrypting one hash will take more money and computing power than that
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:21:43
beneficial till 2008 happens. Or enron, or Washington mutual or the early 2000s real estate crash or....there's just too many. Borrowing works till it horribly doesn't anymore and it happens too often for you to have not noticed.

Only American society actually. Wages in US are a flat curve for the last 50 years. In the rest of the world it's not so flowery either but atleast the graph is not so obviously giving away what the problem is. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:13:24
he's probably one of the 300 people who didn't lose their money in 2008 
bankers take so much pride in their profession. All you need to become a succesful bankers is a white face. Plus literally 99% of the population hates bankers and will walk into wall street and take over if another bailout happens. it's time for people who 'understand finance' to maybe stop understanding it for a bit and give it over to others.

You're right. If the underlying systems aren't changed, any disruptive tech that's meant to be used for good will only be used to further entrench those positions. Altered Carbon anyone?
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:26:18
Forget about them. btc genuinely doesn't care. look at the movement. all btc baby
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:16:42
i know dragonchain might be a shitcoin but knowing which part of the world a type of weed came from just by checking the blockchain will very possibly happen in the next few years. these supply chain management coins are taking a lot of steps to facilitate exactly that for increasing b2c trust in retail. 
I'm not invested in them but oh boy is this not the future or what
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:02:26
No they're not, and good luck applying your knowledge in becoming poor and losing your coins haha

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDD it's gone. Yup, it's gone. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:01:37
Yup. Do not ask me more, but dark web is a wealth of all kinds of stuff you can do. Silk Road shut down but many websites where you can hire hitmen still exist and thrive. Not with btc though you can't. Monero probably 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:38:55
its the same as if you put in 2010. so the code is dumb proof
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:27:28
Idiots who tethered and are still desperately waiting for the imaginary tether crash will lose their coins and fiat, we will make sure of that.

hmmm that is true you know. i would say internet has also been an exception. no govt that says the internet theyd let flourish would one day cause uprisings like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street.
Also I'm sure many oil barons have huge investments in renewables also. these guys hedge everything
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:44:58
Wait.. Why can't you sell bitcoin to people? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:39:57
seriously i love it i can finally buy and immediately send to my wallet without getting physically hurt by it
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:19:21
Not sure but why can't it be a hitmen from the fiat World? This correlation is as bad as thinking some black guy should be the first suspect in a crime because the TV shows show only black criminals. It can be a crypto user who lost a lot of money. Also everyday unorganised pissed off contracts aren't dealt on the dark web. If they are, those guys will be getting caught very soon. It's a high profile scene brother.
Why don't you look for yourself? Dark web is as much a dyor thing as crypto. It's not all dark also a lot of good things there too. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:07:34
Must be tethering it as is value shadowy btc is way higher than then now lol. Atleast don't make it sound like a good decision in the middle of the biggest btc crash against bch since the fork. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:18:07
I think they absolutely will. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:21:32
Really? I just bought a game account and paid with my btc. I spend my coins all the time and replace through exchange 
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:06:35
Please stop referring to goddamn ancaps as anarchists. Ancap is an oxymoron. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:01:16
How can bitcoin ever become a fork? You get the concept of forks? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:02:20
People been wishing this for the past ten years, they'll be wishing it for another 1000 and it will never happen lulz. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:03:42
Huh? Trust me mate I or the consensus is never calling bitcoin cash bitcoin lol. Good lick with this vision hahha
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:58:56
Yes my friend because if it was something other than bitcoin cash the 51% consensus will be willing to make an exception. I'm sure you'll convince them sooner or later than the nano chain is actually the bitcoin chain, like the sheer audacity to even believe something like a bitcoin cash chain grab succeeding in the future. What are you going to do, try to attack the 51% nodes for it? Wait, that's already been tried too hahahaha
lol this btc hate is so kiddish and kinda rektifying at the same time as all shitcoins are crashing against it right now. Actually for 10 years, been crashing against it for ten years, will be crashing against it for a 1000 more trust me. bitcoin cash neo or nano or whoever the hell else is welcome to try to change that fact lulz
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:19:39
You literally have 0 idea how futures or options markets even works.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:04:56
No they don't. If 51% nodes agree a chain is bitcoin, ain't noone fucking going to change thay unless they control the 51% nodes. Bitcoin cash remembers the consequences of trying to manipulate consensus. You can't beat decentralization
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:22:27
so what youve been thinking everyone who bought in 2013 set their target to 20k and now theyre out? lulz. bitcoin' aim is to take over the world money supply. 1 trillion or 100 trillion. No number is low unless that happens, and it doesn't look any close to happening right now as the value is still a tiny 7ish grand with a tiny 300b cap. do not mistake it, most of us know its going to happen without an inch of doubt, especially now, after seeing 2017
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:53:13
Only slightly better than Charlie I sold my soul for cash Lee crying litecoin cash is a scam without one legit argument against it. Good luck you branded brands you. Get a ceo too. Actually you guys actually got  a board of directors don't you lol. Satoshi must be really happy somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:48:54
I know what forks are. Do you know what consensus is?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:33:05
Btc/bch is the biggest crash of the last two weeks of all pairs lol. In dollar terms btc has halved against bch.
