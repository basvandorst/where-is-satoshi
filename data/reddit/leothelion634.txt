Can someone explain how i would go about spending bitcoin using a smartphone if say my coins were stored in a coinbase account?
I got it using cydia's blockchain app and sending coins to the wallet from coinbase.org

OP understands what bitcoin could mean for the future, beyond what mainstream media can give it. BTC will most likely become a staple of global currency and being a part of it in the early stages is like watching a child grow up and take on the world on their own
