you're just a stupid idiot.
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:16:58
in other words, you don't know an answer.
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:05:53
yes. what's not clear? it's created and it's saved somewhere such as file or database, it's implied in my question.  
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:20:31


I don't have blockchain locally
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:15:08


what request?
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:16:10
the command line interface of Electrum has nothing to do with a programming language I want to use.
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:40:12
I'm not doing that manually
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:45:18
what log? what request? check for what? what do you expect to see in it except an address to which I expect to receive money? who is supposed to write anything other than an address to that log?
**How can then check if a certain amount of bitcoins, and I know exactly how much it has to be, has arrived to that address?** via the command line. automatically, via a ruby script. not manually.

what do I need then? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:21:45
right. and how to do that? I mean, what RPC calls exactly and what order?
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:54:50
what do you say Simple Payment Verification (SPV)?
@_date: 2017-02-24 02:07:12
where is the "r" parameter -- the url? they've removed it?
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:20:08


yes, but how then will I get a transaction_id for that address? only by traversing through all the  transactions that have been ever made?
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:14:20
you're overcomplicating that.
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:36:09
that won't work for me because I don't have a web application and don't want to build one only for this purpose.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:19:58
How can then **I** check if a certain amount of bitcoins, and I know exactly how much it has to be, has arrived to that address?
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:11:38
thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:07:14


what is output? what is input?
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:53:34
that's it!
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:46:12
why not?
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:50:27
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:25:42
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:05:43


and if I don't?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:13:05
will it shrink the whole .bitcoin directory by itself after I've run it in the prune mode?
