I’m pretty sure a lot of people predicted the futures trading stabilizing the price a little bit actually

Make that $5700 in 24 hours

Tried it once and ended up just putting it all back in at a higher price because the drop never happened. Lesson learned. HODL always

I feel you. Bought in 2 weeks ago around $7100 and then got greedy and told myself I can sell it at $8100 then wait for the dip and buy back in cheaper. Yeah it’s been hovering at like $8300 for like a week lol. Ended up partially buying back in at $8250. Lesson learned. Only HODL from here on out

Unless you can afford to lose that extra house it’s a terrible idea lol

Would love to see a correction so I can actually buy below the ATH...but the ATH hasn’t stopped...it’s still going 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:05:37
Doubt it. But if it goes sub $6000 again I will be purchasing a larger amount than originally planned lol

Bought the majority of my bitcoin when it was at $7100 last week. Now I’m patiently waiting to see how high this goes. Would love to sell off half of it at $8000ish then buy back in during the next dip

Use GDAX to eliminate some extra fees. They’re owned by Coinbase so you can trust their exchange

Actually sold last night when I was high :( I sold when I was up money so it’s not all bad but I still dun goofed. Waiting for the dip then putting it all back in. Lul

HODL. Nearly impossible to try and time the market. I got greedy and thought why not buy in at $7100, then sell it when it hits $8000 and then buy back in during a dip. As soon as I sold at $8100 it hovered at $8300 for 3 days until I finally bought back in at $8200 lol. Lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:42:57
A dip would be nice so I can buy even more. Why do you think that though?
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:29:33
HODL me bros. I’m afraid
