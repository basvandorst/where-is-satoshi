For future reference, "let's make this interesting" means make a bet.

It's not like he's going to have an answer.
Most of these types people are upper middle class kids who still live with their parents.

It's cool, I'm always happy to help internet tough guys who need rudimentary shit explained to them.
Wealthy people to tend to live longer, yes, but you're most likely talking single digit numbers, maybe ~15 years in extreme circumstances. Wealth is simply not going to make up a 40+ year age gap.
So yes, nearly all people reading this will outlive 2 rich elderly men whose deaths, if they happened today, would surprise no one.  They will probably outlive the man in his 60s as well.
No, of course it wont be all of them.  Only a Sith deals in absolutes, and only a complete fucking moron would ask that question in the first place.

When they misrepresent it by saying "Bitcoin Cash is the Real Bitcoin".

Most redditors are in their 20s.
Munger, Gates, and Buffet are 94, 62, and 87 years old.

Are you really this dense or do you just like arguing on the internet?
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:49:35
Yeah being skeptical is one thing.
If you're calling it rat poison, and aren't shorting it, I think it's fair to call that disingenuous.

He didn't say what it costs more of, he just said it costs more.  More can mean more BTC.

What % of businesses?  Get out of here with that bullshit.  As if that's a number that could ever be measured in the first place.
I'll bet less than 1% of businesses accept Canadian money, does that mean it isn't "money" either?
I'm not going to have some pedantic argument here but bottom line: what you said is misleading at best.  You're painting a picture that you can't spend btc on goods and services and that is simply not the case.

For you...

What about overstock.com, newegg.com, expedia.com, etc.?
I get the point you're trying to make, but saying "virtually no businesses accept [bitcoin]" is asinine.  You could just say "most of the places I shop don't accept it".  It makes the same point, and you don't even have to lie.

"in effect" is right there in your own pasted definition...
"In effect, there are no businesses that accept Bitcoin." is a false statement.
This isn't rocket science.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:25:26
"virtually none" is ambiguous, it can not be part of a fact.
You are taking "virtually none" to mean "almost none", whereas to others, it means "in effect, none".

I understand what you're saying, generally speaking, but don't understand the angle you're arguing here.
What about companies that accept Canadian money online and later convert it to USD?  Are you saying Canadian money isn't "money"?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:33:56
I didn't ask what country we're in, it's either money or it's not.
If the answer isn't "no", there's only one other choice.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:31:26
I mean I'm probably not the person to teach this to you but I'll try my best:
I'm saying you can't measure the total number of businesses, that's impossible, it's a number we can't know.
That does not, however, mean that it isn't a number.
The "I'll bet" is meant more as "probably", like a loose speculation, whereas the other guy was coming from a place of "once ___% of businesses accept btc, that makes it money".
