If one hasn't yet, one should take a look at their existing budget and expenses and see if that is the amount of expenses they are willing to continue with. If not, one can strive to reduce it if it is at all possible. 
For some reducing how much they spend is very possible and some are very willing.
For others it may not even be possible.

I do not understand that sentence and analogy. Can someone explain it?
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:09:31

Can someone explain this expression?

"To the moon." :p

Its not a big deal. It was just a hyperbole.

Yep can confirm, exact same thing happened to me...
Anyone know if its possible to be "unbanned", is it possible to be able to use Interac again? Not that I would use Interac eTransfers again for bitcoins, just for other uses

Why do you think so?  Im not necessarily thinking differently from you, but Id just like to see your reasoning/arguments?
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:30:47
Wait, sorry Im just confused, so is this a thing now?
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:43:51
agh god damn it. All of this backing up has made my life harder than I thought it would. My encrypted file is on the cloud. Should I put the cloud into the toilet too?
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:25:44
So do I like just print out my private key and flush it? Nah, I should just print out a public-private pair on paper and send it to that and then flush it right?
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:59:55
Hmm it would be even better though if there was a secure offline wallet that OP could see/screen reader could read

Well, apparently from what I've heard the location of Nakamoto seems a bit all over the place. The times of his communication seems to indicate one region (a certain coast, west or east, I forget), but the way he spelt seemed to match with Birtish spelling conventions. And then the name of Nakamoto seemed to indicate that he was Japanese.
Don't quote me on this though. This is all from memory and I absolutely have no sources.

What determines a wallet.dat's size? The number of address pairs (public-private) in the wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:34:22
Oh man, weird reaction from me. When I first read that I was thought "Nooo thatll run out all the addresses" for a a split second. Then realized how many addresses there truly is.

Come on, if somebody is demoing bitcoin transactions, they are not aware of those things (unfortunately).
Good to know and share for future reference though
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:53:37
lol youre assuming people are logical. Which theyre not 
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:59:20
Oh yes let us make bad comments about something without stating why

Can you expand on this? What do you mean by bottom line?

I was skeptical at first but I checked it out and God *does* have a phone, so this is legit.

15.6 BTC. Nice! Im the same age, but I just have ~2 BTC. 
7 months ago, I had like 5 BTC... But I sold them because I thought the peak in April/May *was* the only peak for Bitcoin... Guess not haha
My peer are not really into Bitcoin. Ive done them about it. And one friend wants to get into it but only when the price drops. None of my friends (to my knowledge) own any bitcoin except me.

LocalBitcoin! Head onto that website might have some ppl there in your area willing to sell Bitcoin.

Ah I see, is this pretty much the same with whenever I download the Tails live OS?
In the link, they tell me verify using their OpenPGP key.
What's so special about the OpenPGP key? I feel like it's a bit more special than just a simple hash function onto the data, but I'm not sure how?
And how would one be able to implement the PGP/GPG (not sure what they are) verification process?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:00:27
I doubt it... But hey, if it did, I guess that would be awesome?

So if I understand correctly, there is (for asymmetric decryption/encryption) a pair of keys. Text encrypted by key A, can only be decrypted by key B? Text encrypted by key B can only be decrypted by key A?
In this case, the public key and the private key (and the private key is only known by the creator).
The creator/author creates a hash of the program, the author then encrypts this hash using his private key, to obtain this so-called signature. Right?
The author then posts this signature (an private-key-encrypted hash of the program) on the website.
The users, download three things, the program itself, the signature and the public key. 
The user then hashes the program himself. He takes the signature, and decrypts it using the public key to obtain the hash that was created by the author. Now if the two hash corresponds (ie. matches) with each other, that means the program is the same program that the author created ! (Assuming there was no hash collision, but I bet that is rare to happen, right?) 
Is this all correct? If so, wow that sounds absolutely ingenious. If I were to read about the math involved, I bet it would sound even more incredible! It almost sounds like magic.
Are there any flaws in the cryptographic-signature system? Are there cons to this method of authentication? And I heard this word "web-of-trust" being thrown around before, what's up with that?

I supposed that you're underaged. How did you come to trade in an exchange? As someone underage, does anyone know how/where I could trade bitcoins? Which exchanges can I do this at?
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:37:55
Verify the signatures, that's what it's called!
Verifying signatures, does that allow one to verify that the wallet is uncomprimised/uncorrupted/etc.?
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:38:09
Hmm, that sounds not that expensive. How much is a cruise usually?
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:26:10
I dunno, youre missing a case.
The market is not going up, does not imply the market is going down. What if the market stood still?
