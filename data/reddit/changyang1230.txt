Tether pretends to be the equivalent of USD by claiming that they are backed by real USD somewhere owned by the company that operates it. The problem is they have never given convincing proof that this is true. If it turns out that they don’t actually have the backing USD, then they are essentially printing money out of thin air.

It's disappointing that the reporter did not do their due diligence in disclosing the bloody obvious conflict of interest.
It's made out as if bitcoin.com is a website about Bitcoin, when it's always been the case where bitcoin.com is a website for Bitcoin Cash.
In another word, the news should simply read, "Bitcoin Cash promoter says Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin".
Move along.

No. Confirmation is additional block added to the chain.

It started off as a drunken typo, but over time it became a backronym for “hold on for dear life”.

If we are talking astronomy we should really be using SI units which makes it 384000. Even better! :P
(Trivia: NASA once lost a mars rover because of a miles / km conversion error)

On block chain the regular tx fee is now down to 0.05 dollars while the priority is around 1 dollar.

Are you planning to invest in higher amount in the future? 
If you end up losing money just to buy the wallet, the additional security is probably not worth the money spent IMHO. The physical wallets cost around 100 dollars.

As of today they added Quoine as another exchange under BTC/AUD pair. Haven’t heard of that other one.

What is your definition of money?

Thanks for your opinion about the non-interchangeable nature of these two concepts. 
I still think that it's fun to compare the two in terms of their order of magnitude in the grand scheme of economy, however. As a measurement of its "total value" it is still a crudely applicable measure. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:55:57

Your buddy must do a very limited form of IT who does not explore / learn much beyond what he does. It's quite unlikely to not know about cryptocurrency and mining when you read up about IT these days, IMHO.

Fair enough. 
If you look at the effect of moving these assets on its own price and the entity associated with it then they are not directly comparable. 
It's still interesting to see such comparison, however. It may not mean much to the purist but it evokes some interesting thoughts when we say, for example, that Bill Gates net worth is more than so and so state or so and so country's GDP.

8 sounds similar to 发 which means prosper.

And not even factually correct for that matter. 
Crypto means based on cryptography, there’s nothing on the definition of crypto currency that says it has to be decentralised.
