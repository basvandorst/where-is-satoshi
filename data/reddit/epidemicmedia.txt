Simplex is not answering their emails nor do they have a contact phone number. I made a purchase right at the deepest drop on Thursday Morning. Bitcoin.com's ID Verification crapped out, and I had to submit docs manually. I got one automated emailed and have been stonewalled since. If they are a reputable company, why are they acting so damn shady?

I was looking to make a larger limit purchase to take advantage of timing in the market. I learned my lesson from experimenting, but I found a go to service that I'll use for now on.

Well somebody is giving me the run around. Either way Im stuck in the middle with Giant hold on my account, missing out on plays I should have been able to make. 
Even in the event everything you say checks out, Its still no excuse for Simplex's terrible customer service. I was very polite and respectful to them. Im sure these ppl are rolling in Millions, but I made a considerable purchase, they could at least provide decent customer service. If they did, i wouldn't be here having a chat with you!

I wasn't aware of the whole BCH story until afterwards. I am just a guy trying to by some coin.

My bank specifically said its up to the processor to contact them to cancel a hold. So I believe my Financial Institution more than some random company in the middle of Israel that is not responding to any emails and doesn't have a phone number listed anywhere. Reputable business don't leave their customers in the dark without any info or options. Also it was a Debit Card if it makes any difference.
