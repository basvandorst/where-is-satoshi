Facebook doesn't sell the information posted, they sell the metadata statistics about the users to anyone willing to pay. Every other data company that wants information from you needs to get you to Accept the Terms and Conditions which always have data snakes built in. 
That's the "only sharing information with those who people ask us to share it with" so they take those third-party agreements and count that as "asking us to make a profit off your information"

I've experienced depression (both myself and in others), but never to the point of suicide (in them either). In the end, we always come to the same conclusion that it's a much better deal to be alive and suffering through the beautiful agony of the ability to feel anything versus not existing or being trapped in a lifeless body. If I ever get 100% paralyzed and comatosed, you (everyone on the internet) has explicit permission (and direction) to kill me. That's the only thing I could ever imagine being worse than death. 
That all said, we all know what crypto is for and what it stands for. Making a bad sell or buy decision or missing an opportunity isn't enough to sway the majority of people here to shame themselves because they lost the time-race against fiat. I never said anything about depression being anything elementary, I'm just saying that if someone who was so invested in crypto killed themselves over it, it wouldn't have been the main reason they did it. Typically it's just the "last straw". 
That all said, I'm just incredibly skeptical about a 1 week old reddit account that posts about college football and cannibus oil might just be karma-whoring. Just saying...

Dude, when people start blaming Millenials for all the terrible shit going on, I'm like, "Hey, we aren't any different from the rest of you. You created a shitty life and threw us in it, we're just not going down silently." Really grinds my gears

Like, I'm not a bad guy, and I'm definitely not an dispassionate guy, but when something smells funny, I'm going to call it out.

It's not high when you spend a lot. It's a base fee, but for small transactions it's enormous. $10 to send $5? Absurd. $10 to send $200? Taxes. Not currently useful for "buying coffee" but neither is a gold bar from the bank.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:49:00
I'm look into it. Base model only, unless it's the same price. Also, slim, not pro. Figured I'd have better luck
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:36:24
Honestly, sounds pretty fake but okay. There's no reason anyone should kill themselves, especially not over money. If it is true, I hope there is a reprieve from your mourning.

So you basically want to put together a team of people who are already in a team, to work on work they are already working on, and ride their success into the rich wonderland?
No, I will not help you scam some developers

This is fucking stupid. So fucking stupid.
The only thing this ETF concept accomplishes is making people think they own "one" of something instead of realizing you can buy any fraction of a BTC you want. Rather than pumping some super dumb start-up full of hype so they can get rich of transaction fees for their fake ETFs. ETFs were created for the stock market to allow multiple individuals to share one fraction of a stock share without incurring the legal repercussions of requiring full party (all fractional owner) approval prior to selling to trading the full stock. Bitcoin isn't like that, which is exactly why you don't see ETFs for actual commodities like Gold and Oil.
This is a scam. Don't fall for it, Redditors.

I think the idea of this post is for the "pennant" features that would indicate that 99.5% of the time after a pennant formation in market analysis, the security moves aggressively in the direction of the pre-pennant direction, in this case, up. 
This is how we see the $30kUSD/BTC by September/October

QQ: Did the $6k longs from 2018 end up cashing in when we broke it a few months ago? Whats the typical return?

i thought thias was about another "verification required" announcwement. I got the fuck out of Bittrex once they announced required ID verification for all withdrawals (prior to enforcement). Good thing, too. Homogenized my portfolio to BTC, LTC, and ETH before sending it to my hardware wallets. Fuck all that reporting

If everyone dumps that little bch for BTC, we'll see the robots react and kick BTC up another $2000
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:40:44
Honestly, I think you're onto something here. If BTC ever drops below $100, it would be in an single lightspeed spike to 0$ because someone cracked some weakness/code and can manipulate the entire system, thus making it worthless. I don't think this will every happen unless those early day miners do something crazy and all sell at once or a fundamental flaw in the algorithm is exploited or something, but that said, I think you're right about $5 days because it would never settle there. The big money is attempting to find the floor if a major but not crippling exploit is found. (basically, whats the worth of a first-to-market token?) Thoughts?

I was always a fan of the term "micro Bits" or "mB" as a function of 6 decimal places to the right. Much more friendly and not killing to the Bitcoin branding

I don't honestly see how BTC stays above $1500 prior to Aug 1. Just look at what happened to Etherium before the split: obviously way lower figures, but very similar trading prior to the split. I'm selling now and buying back in at the ground floor.
