sell it a few months ago and start buying back in now. Unless the low is $2k and wall street is planning a quick $2k to $4k flip. In which case...

All those people putting life savings into bitcoin is still a small drop in the bucket compared to what "big money" can do.

As someone who hasn't own bitcoins since I sold them all for huge profit at about $1000 years ago, this is exciting. Might get good prices soon, once this dips below $2k.

You spent all that time preparing for a $30k+ investment and you didn't take any... _finance_ courses?
Make no mistake; I'm not criticizing your investment, and it's a good thing that you did all the research to fully understand what you were actually buying. It just seems like after doing all that work, it wouldn't take much more to brush up on on your financial/investing knowledge as well. You may already be financially savvy, in which case, forget I said anything.

Yeah only older people or people who overextended are really upset about this. Anyone else should be somewhat excited.
Note I don't own any crypto right now (sold all my bitcoin at 16k), but I'm looking at buying back in.

Yeah... if I had any money on exchanges, I would definitely deliberately pull them out _before_ this event occurs...
Surely anyone in their right mind would too?

Think about the wealth distribution in the US alone (let alone other countries) - the 1% has more money than the entire 90% or lower group _combined_.
One rich person's wallet could contain more bitcoins than tens of thousands of average joes buying bitcoin with their lifesavings combined. With such a huge supply, it's very easy for these people to overtake demand with a big sell order. This in turn will drop the price.
Essentially, market's don't move because lots of retail traders do the same thing; they move because a handful of big firms make big buys/sells.
For example, you might hear from EVERYONE you know, your parents, your friends, your coworkers, etc. that they're buying say, Apple stock. With everyone you know buying, demand should go up and thus the price should go up too right? In actuality, a single hedge fund or bank could sell 100x more Apple shares than everyone you know is buying combined. Thus, the supply increases, and the price goes down.
This is why self-fulfilling prophecies aren't a guarantee in markets. It's also why public sentiment is almost never a good long term trading strategy. In the short term, you might be able to make good money on a highly-leveraged quick trade, but in the long term, it means nothing.

Are people really trusting and ready enough for that? I'd just think you wanna verify your transaction from your own client... at least for now. God forbid the browser extension fucks up and does something wrong and you spend the next few minutes stressing over making it right.

Unless you were able to capitalize at an extremely opportune moment (and for a substantially small gain), no event like this would really impact the price of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin blew up. Everyone and their dog knows about bitcoin now. All it takes is a few big firms buying in to trivialize the price impact of a bunch of people buying small amounts of bitcoin at the same time. Those firms have bought in already. They have _so_ much money, even just by dipping their toe into the bitcoin waters, their holdings massively dwarf the combined value of all the little guys.

There are way more buyers than sellers in an economy. The payment systems will always favor the former.
