It's a hard fork.. which basically means the same thing as it wouldn't be bitcoin anymore.. however anyone could do it - it's just convincing everyone else to switch over to the new system. 
There's this idea that if only core would agree to increase the blocks that everyone else would go along with it.. but really core have no special power here it requires everyone to switch to a new system and there's no guarantee that core saying it's a good idea will make everyone else fall into line. 
The other thing is there is no need to increase the block size.. what is needed is a new payments layer - which is happening. Once it's in place there will be no ugrent need to increase blocks.. in the short term there is also no need to increase blocks as they are only full because of spam transcations that are part of a psychological attack on bitcoin. The spammers can't afford to spend much on their spam so everyone who really needs to use it can get their transactions included for a modest fee. 
The fee market is also necessary anyway as it's part of the bitcoin economic model.. as block rewards decline, fees pick up the slack so we need to start paying for this anyway.. once the payment layer is in place thousands of transactions will be aggregated into a single blockchian transaciton with a high fee (but shared by thousands so low for each payment).
When the core planned hardfork fails to materialize later this year it will solidify trust in the existing system as it will be obvious that hard forking is impossible and the foundational bitcoin layer is set in stone forever.
