I don't have any retirement fund for this reason, I want access to my current and fixed assets all the time.

I only store my BTC locally, once bitten...

I wonder if Microsoft would be as open if they had not been hit hard by failing sales. Either way this is great news.

TIL about changetip, even though I own Bitcoin for more than year

I stopped after I could not withdraw for not being verified, once verified(after a month long delay) I pulled everything I had deposited. Just really pissed they have all my private info on record now.

If they decide to meet on Jekyll Island then I'd be really worried.

I pulled all my coins out around mid January, doged a bullet.
The fact that I had to verify my account AFTER depositing bitcoins that I now was unable to withdraw set off alarm bells, luckily I got verified after a few angry emails just in time to pull all my coins. But they have my personal details which is a concern.

Spar in my country does not accept Bitcoin.

Fuck that dude.

I've never trusted her, guess my instinct was right.

I'm seriously worried about my personal details used to verify my mtgox account a while back, very dodgey.
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:50:06
I agree wholeheartedly.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:08:28
So happy I removed all my BTC from my MTGOX wallet just before this happened, I was not allowed to withdrawal **my** deposited BTC until I was verified as well.

I had known about bitcoin back in the early days, I wish I had started out then instead of waiting.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:38:39
What if it's already paid off?
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:15:06
What bums me is that I passed up my opportunity to mine for bitcoin in the early days thinking it would better using my time mining for gold in WoW instead.

I know, which is why I said I cant!
Although, I was not serious with my response, but thanks for the math, probably is unlikely in our lifetimes.

Therefore I can't wait for when 1 mBTC = $1000!

That’s the right attitude. Financial decisions I felt made sense to me have always been the best. Those I’ve borrowed from experts failed or underperformed.

I do UI and UX, I would be happy to vounteer some time

If it were not for Mt. Gox I would probably be in the same situation.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:52:28
Explains why the price has skyrocketed!
