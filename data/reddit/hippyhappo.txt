Yep, I just received the same letter today.

I bought the Bitcoin for the family member when all this was still a grey area (it was back in 2013 or 2014). It was a fairly large amount, but I never received a 1099 because I never reached the 200 transaction number with Coinbase (just held them for the family member and then sold when they asked me to several years later).
I don't know why any of this would constitute money laundering. Heck, the family member was in a higher tax bracket than me, so this resulted in the government getting significantly more tax income.
Anyway, I'm gonna talk to an accountant and see if there's something I should do to clear this up. As I said though, I didn't intentionally do anything wrong (as I said, this was all a grey area when I bought them, so I didn't think much of it at the time).

What worries me are the derivatives. They can use them to hedge their losses every time they dump.

Yeah, I just received a 6174 today and did nothing wrong (only purchased Bitcoin, but haven't sold any yet). Although I did purchase some for a family member a few years ago, and then sold them for that family member last year using my account (the family member then paid the taxes on them). I didn't think much of it at the time, but I suppose that could cause some issues...

Going back in time several hundred years and holding individuals accountable to today's standards is kind of ridiculous. You could do this to virtually every country (you do realize slavery was legal pretty much everywhere at one time or another). What's important is that you learn from it / don't repeat the mistakes of the past.

It's called price suppression. The price of Bitcoin is being manipulated by powerful interests who don't want it to succeed.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:23:16
I'm living in the real world, where Bitcoin is a huge threat to the current power structure. And to be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. I want Bitcoin to succeed as much as anybody, but denying the reality of the huge hurdles we have in our way is of no practical benefit (aside from the false sense of security it provides).
Here's some interesting reading material that illustrates some of the issues:

Any decent person (democrat or republican) acting in good faith will be weeded out of the political process long before they can effect any meaningful change.

Naw, I never got a 1099K from them.

This is way more common than people realize. In particular, the social media bot presence is FAR greater than most people realize. People use bots to upvote / like / promote certain viewpoints, and downvote / dislike other viewpoints, all to advance certain agendas. The sheer power of this to shape views / socially engineer outcomes cannot be underestimated.

I don't think I went above the 20k threshold in any given year. I suspect the IRS got a wider list of names than was reported.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:37:18
Of course, if it has a small pullback / drops back below 10K, they'll all run stories about it "tanking"

I don't know if I'd say that. He was a model and actor that leveraged his position to build relationships with a lot of really smart people. He's more of a businessman in my mind. I guess you could say he's smart enough to recognize and listen to really smart people. Maybe I'm just being petty, but in my mind, the smart people are the ones who create the technology these venture capitalists invest in.

Seriously, why do people play team politics? None of these politicians give two shits about you (on either side of the isle). They are the most diabolically manipulative, rapacious people on the planet. They actively divide us, because when we're divided, we are incapable of holding government accountable. Those in power can then do whatever the hell they want without resistance. Stop fighting over this petty nonsense and realize "we the people" are all on the same team. The enemy is the rampant corruption that's infiltrated our government. Until we recognize this and start banding together, nothing will ever change for the better.

Politicians are politicians. By the time you get to the top of the political hierarchy, all the decent people operating in good faith are weeded out. Nobody on either side of the isle gives two shits about any of us. Stop falling for the whole "Democrat" / "Republican" thing. All that rhetoric does is further divide us, which is exactly what those in power want (if we band together, then we can hold those in power accountable).

I'm sorry, but I don't trust any of these Silicon Valley billionaires. They're all a bunch of comically hypocritical megalomaniacs / magnificently devoid of self awareness.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:20:13
No, don't use anything from [bitcoin.com]( You want [bitcoin.org]( instead.

FYI, I think there's a lot of bot action on this sub. Only the stupid / mindless memes get upvoted and anything even remotely useful remains in obscurity.

Yeah, I was always under the impression that he was just an all around bad guy (based solely on what I had heard about him from other people / media). I then happened to catch a pretty lengthy interview of his on Joe Rogan's show, which led me to check out some more stuff of his. It's pretty crazy how ridiculously misrepresented his views are (and how many people parrot these views, without actually listening to him directly).

Well, I re-downloaded and verified the file sig, so I'm not sure what the deal is. It appears to be legit but still seems really suspicious to me. Maybe I'll just use the Linux version in a VM to be safe.
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:22:01
Yeah, I don't recall it asking for calendar / contacts on any previous versions I've used, so it might be something new with the latest version. Anyway, I searched as well and couldn't find any mention of it. The latest version has only been out a couple weeks though so maybe that's why.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:27:33
I downloaded from here: [
I didn't verify the file signature. I'm pretty sure the link is legit but it just seems odd that it would ask to access calendar and contacts (I have no idea why it would need that info). Just wanted to make absolutely certain that it's legit.

Yeah, unfortunately Linux doesn't work well with the funky keyboard layout of the touchbar MacBook Pro so I'm stuck with OSX (unless I want to run it in a VM).
