Why would you want his window to be cracked?
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:32:28
You're saying another call for doom, but there's also "zzz another call for bull runs"
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:50:52
So it's always going to increase in price according to your rules? because it's always going to go up and down and then go back up to higher.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:13:51
Atleast you're honest 
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:34:16
Who's to say bitcoin doesn't lose value as people sell it to buy things (because if we're being real probably 90% of the people holding bitcoin now don't care about the tech behind it they want to make money).
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:47:24
But according to your logic if 6-8k is nothing and 20k is nothing, investing everything I currently have is a no risk investment.
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:23:57
Or it could never happen, there's the same chance of both. It might be already at the correct price.
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:51:54
\*insert business I'm currently invested in\* will 100% grow 1000x, invest in it and you'll see
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:34:47
Why? Because you want it to go higher? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:05:37
But the supply is finite now and demand is constantly growing but the price is going down. But nobody knows what the future will hold, it might go down to 100$ each and a few places will accept it or it might go to 10,000$ and everyone will accept it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:40:18
I like the option where I pay for something that doesn't ever arrive and can't dispute the transactions because the money's gone and there's no way to trace the guy who just scammed me :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:41:13
Careful there son, don't be going against the crowd with your facts like that
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:46:22
Who decides who's lying in a smart contract?
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:20:11
I can also possibly deadlift 500kg but it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:30:42
Or he's like a large portion of us who are here to buy and sell to make money and really couldn't care about the technology behind it.
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:14:51
In a modern day society I couldn't see that going down well, lawyers would have a field day. But everyone has their own views I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:36:34
It'll be 250k by May 2018, crypto experts (heavily invested in it) are saying it will happen as they've seen these trends before with markets!
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:46:54
Do you have any links to cases where this has happened to a random citizen? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:01:19
Why spend it when you can not spend it and wait for it to go up to £1m per coin in the next 6 months 
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:35:26
One of the problems I have with crypto is, if the will of this subreddit is to come true and the banks go under and everyone moves to crypto. What's backing it? If it fails and becomes worthless, something major happens and everyones money was on a hard drive on their computer what happens to the worlds wealth at that point since it's all digital?
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:39:10
I'm not going to, I don't really want to lose any money. I'll buy it when it "takes over the world" and we're forced to.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:37:55
I'm probably just dumb but that made no sense to me at all, but you seem like you know what you're talking about so imma chill
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:15:47
I want some cases where this has happened, I could say the government seized my car and sold it when I didn't collect it from them but that's not proof that it happened.
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:30:29
I'm still not feeling a legal case that shows that somebody's safety deposit box has been taken by the bank 
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:28:39
What's wrong with storing it in a safe deposit box at a bank? Are they gonna come in in the middle of the night and take shavings of it?
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:04:35
Why does it matter? If you tell people how many bitcoins you have and it makes you vulnerable, won't the end result of bitcoin replacing actual money mean people with large amount of bitcoins won't be safe?
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:32:39
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:07:51
We're not in that bad of an economic crisis that they're going to close the banks any time soon. Was all of the money in them boxes then taken by the government or was it retrieved when the banks opened?
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:31:50
Oh I bury all of my money in the yard i don't have a safety deposit box, much safer that way if the bank decide they want my house I can come in the night and dig my gold bars up 
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:29:03
Not really, everyone keeps talking about buying the dip but every time they say this is the dip! It goes even lower.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:22:06
Nothing because they can't prove you own it I assume
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:43:52
That's articles, I'm talking about modern cases 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:06:01
Want me to restructure the sentence to include tenses for you?
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:14:03
I'm not debating the case that what you're stating every actually just randomly happens l. I think you're just paranoid.
@_date: 2019-02-05 07:54:28
How will they fail? Just curious really, you seem really sure so must have an argument to the contrary
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:50:26
Shh, let the people on the subreddit dream, have you not seen the charts going up?! it'll never stop!
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:31:45
\&gt; most people don't care about Bitcoin   
And here's why I struggle to imagine it taking off, once again I may be wrong (and I will be wrong in your eyes). After seeing the odd post from here pop up every now and then I see a lot of people comparing it to dollars, when in reality it's meant to be its own currency to be used and not sold, people are using this as an investment to make actual money. I really do wish it all works out for you guys and you all become the super wealthy and the system all goes great and solves world hunger, but I personally in my life time can't see that happening (my opinion, it'll not be the same as you and probably most people here due to the amount of money they have invested in it).
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:49:56
I think if they really wanted to they could find a way to stop the use of cryptocurrencys all together (Not saying they will/I want them to) but I can imagine the US making it illegal the accept Bitcoin as payment would kill it for the US (Not saying they will)
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:59:48
Or...."Son, let me tell you about the night I paid $0.03 USD for a beer and a blow job!"
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:38:27
You'll be sorry if you sell for that price, it's EASILY going to be 1-2m per coin, have you seen the charts? It'll forever grow; people thought it would stop at 600$ and sold, people will think it'll stop at 200k and sell.
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:03:11
Why wait till 20k when it's going to be 250k by mid may?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:49:32
Yeah I get you, I bought a some chicken breasts last week and some rice, rather the government weren't looking at my transactions so I wanna pay in bitcoin. 
I also sent my mate a message asking if he wants to go to the pub tomorrow night I also don't want the government to know about because if they know the pubs I go to it's a complete invasion of my privacy and they can use it to blackmail me. So I only send my messages via encrypted carrier pigeon. 
Now a none sarcastic answer is my friend is exactly the same as a lot of people on here, he wants EVERYTHING to be encrypted because he doesn't want anyone reading his conversations about which steak house is the best in town or that he doesn't like my mate Kevin because he's a dick. 
Now imagine this, a child trafficking ring is operating somewhere in the world(Probably quite a few). But because my friends advocating for full privacy and untraceability of his conversations about my mate Kevin they can't get access to any transactions, conversations, or information which could lead to capturing them. But you know it's all good because Kevin doesn't know James thinks he's a dick.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:51:32
A gathering about the blockchain and you don't buy tickets with crypto? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:48:37
I've got nothing to hide, I just want to hide it
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:23:12
"Analyst with money invested in bitcoin says his investments are going to increase"
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:02:17
Shhh sh bitcoin is different don't argue, it's the one and only, i've read the Daily Mail article about it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:52:34
The weather in the UK directly correlates with a day when bitcoin rose 5% at 17:42. By this pattern I can say that everyone should be buying now.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:20:56
I hold all of my money in bitcoin, and transfer back and forth by exchanging coins on a USB with my local dealer
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:34:14
Liquidate your valuables and buy bitcoins, the banks will steal EVERYTHING from you.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:05:10
I'm assuming this is an article of somebodies who's invested a lot of money into something telling people to invest in it because he has a lot of money invested in it?
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:22:48
Not losing anything when you're just converting your currency, it's not an investment :)
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:12:52
Exactly, people with weak hands don't deserve to be part of the future.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:42:23
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:12:40
200,000 by the end of march if we carry on this trend.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:31:03
The banks are evil, they'll find a way! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:18:19
Haha spending it! Look at this guy everyone, spending it! What do you think this is? A currency to be used?!
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:52:45
You bought 1 BTC, which is now still worth 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:16:59
So what happens when there's no way to tax people and public services fail?
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:35:48
This is it! we're going to 100k like the investors predicted by mid may!
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:52:32
It's not going to stop at $1 million, I read a DailyMail article about it and the commentators were saying the same.
