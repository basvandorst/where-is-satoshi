I just started to buy bitcoin and after much research I used coinbase. The process was easy and quick. It does take a few days to get your bitcoins but I was not in a hurry to use or sell. After I get a bit more comfortable with the process I will probably try local coins out and purchase directly from the seller. In addition to deciding how you are going to buy the bitcoin you will also need to decide which "wallet" method you are going to use to store them.

Right now I would only trust breadwallet. Over time other alternatives may develop so keep up to date on the comments via reddit.

I started out by doing research by reviewing the posts on reddit and bitcoin talk. I found that coindesk.com had some great information. After you get comfortable with the process and decide whether you want to buy bitcoin to trade, save for the future or buy goods and services - open an account. I opened my coinbase account about a month ago and started out buying small amounts of bitcoin ($100-$200). I am in for the long term and will continue buying on a periodic basis.
To answer your question - yes I believe that bitcoin can lose value if people stop using it. But remember the bitcoin hype is just starting and it is likely that more and more people will get involved. 
It took me a great deal of time to research bitcoin and I wanted to make it easier for others so I am creating a easy to understand bitcoin buying guide that will hopefully help out others that want to find out more about bitcoin. If you are interested in getting a copy of the guide you can get on our list at

if there were a reputable bitcoin ETF available I would definitely invest in it. That way I would not have to worry about the security/storage issues. At this point I wanted to get involved and understand the bitcoin process so I went out and purchased coins outright.
