Do u not see how ironic that is? How many times do you see people complaining about losing their private key, getting phished, exchanges going bankrupt, getting hacked and then losing ALL of their money PERMANENTLY.  None of which would happen if they just used a normal bank. 
If your bank account gets hacked into, you get your money back. If your bank becomes insolvent, you get your money back. If you forget ur bank pin, you can still get your money back.
Sure you can go on about the infrastructure not being there yet, but you guys have been saying that for almost a fucking decade.  You guys are so filled with greed and get rich schemes that you lie to yourself about the true value of crypto.

He most certainly does.

I would love to spend some time responding to your points later but am a little busy atm.  I just want to leave the first paragraph I read in your article here...
With wealthy Greeks and others who are hiding their money in secret foreign bank accounts to AVOID PAYING TAXES are escaping government raids on assets of state debtors, tax officials through October confiscated more than 105,000 bank accounts.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:09:37
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:02:53
I’m very well aware that there has been a financial crisis.
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:27:56
I wouldn’t say it’s another discussion. Seems like a fundamental disagreement between us.  Just curious as to why you think a true free market is good while it has quite literally never shown to work.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:10:18
You make a solid point about Wikileaks.  However, they're a very niche use case of crypto that's relatively legal.  The only other way you'd be cut off from the financial system is if you're doing something illegal.   I don't really want a system where people can't be cut off from the financial system -- it's actually a good thing.  
You think it'd be good for a terrorist organization to have free reign when it comes to financing their operations?  Fuck no.

Inflation is around 2% and you can earn money in a savings account. Any significant amount of money should be invested anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:22:03
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:10:26
Doesn’t mean your ideas about money and freedom don’t stem from ignorance of the topic.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:04:44
You don't really seem to have much of an understanding of economics.  inflation is HEALTHY, it is good.  Sure the future value of your money will be less than its present value but that's why there's treasury inflation protected securities.  Risk-free investments that are guaranteed to stay on pace with inflation.  Salaries are in fact going up, they may not outpace inflation, but they are indeed rising.  
Anyways, what exactly does crypto have to do with this? Do you think the Fed is causing inflation to fuck over U.S. citizens? Does that realistically make sense?
I also have reasoning to believe that you don't give a single fuck about poor people becoming more poor and you're simply looking to get rich off of crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:08:14
How exactly? It quite literally is the most dominant currency in the world and it’s very likely that it will stay that way. I’m not quite sure what ur alluding too.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:21:13
What’s wrong with the government being able to control money? It’s regulated to keep it safe, secure, and stable — all of which benefit us.  Why do you hate the government so much?
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:06:31
So you want a complete and true free market economy?
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:36:01
Are you trolling? I can’t find any information that provides any evidence that people actually use it. 
I used to be heavily interested in bitcoin &amp; spent a bit of time researching. I’m not blind to how it’s used.
Might be a gross generalization to say it’s only used for drugs. I guess you could throw gambling in there and then maybe a couple freelancers who accept it but other than that there’s nothing significant about it’s use.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:24:09
Alright I will. I’ll get back to you
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:14:35
As a currency? Who in the fuck buys anything other than drugs with bitcoin? Be real man.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:19:05
Mate, I’m here for discussion. That’s literally what reddit is for. I’m allowed to have a different opinion than the rest of the sub. I’ve made a fair amount of coin from BTC but have also realized it’s flaws. I’m here to see both sides of the story.
Inflation encourages investment, investment is good as it creates value over time. You have to be finically illiterate to not beat inflation. There’s risk-free investments meant to beat it, that means you will never lose your money.
You don’t care about the intention or you don’t understand it? I think the latter.  Your views are so black and white about how the buying power of your money works.  The government is helping you but you’re too dense to understand it.
I’m sorry I want to have a legitimate discussion but you lack the fundamental understanding of how the US financial system works even on Economics101 level.
The poster above has a good understanding and we’re facilitating a decent discussion which is the point of reddit. This isn’t a place to circlejerk eachother cuz “BItCOin iS tHe fUTurE”. You have to look at why you believe what you do and whether or not it really makes sense. 
I can tell all of your viewpoints are shit you read off of this subreddit. Go listen to anti crypto people for once and get ur head outta ur ass.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:37:56
I’m not mad. I’m just explaining why I think it’s stupid.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:54:08
It’s a little unfair for you to blame her for not taking your gift seriously. However, if you truly do give it to her/her kids in your will, then that’s absolutely fine. Otherwise you’re kind of* being an asshole in the situation as it was a gift and you did anticipate the future scenario... meaning it was very reasonable.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:39:19
You first called me stupid and then said “why the fuck are you here”. Of course I’m going to be condescending if someone speaks to me that way.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:43:22
You make a strong point.  However, I don’t really see how these issues are solved with BTC.  The money being sound comes from more regulation, not a new currency.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:00:18
Isn’t the whole point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank?
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:08:11
I completely agree that it allows from prosperity but as the financial crisis has show us, it comes at a great cost
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:09:39
I’d say trump surely was pretty bright growing up but he most certainly has not aged well.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:05:45
Haha that's what banks said -- then the financial crisis happened.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:10:22
Some serious mental gymnastics you got going on there.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:43:23
Sounds like a time SALT would come in handy. Check it out. They give you cash loans and you give them crypto as a collateral. You still own the crypto currency so you realize any appreciation or depreciation of the money, it's a really interesting project.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:42:49
I loved the response and learned quite a bit from it, thanks. No reason to throw in the last piece of shade at the end man, keep things as civil as possible.

When you open it, it's immediately Chinese. He probably just assumed there was no translation because I did the same.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:59:54
But not how life works unfortunately
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:53:59
Hate to say it, but it'll never happen. With over 2000% increase in value, there's no shot they'd even think about paying any more than the law tells them they have to.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:07:38
I honestly can’t even think of one. Can you?
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:10:09
I think you just learned why bitcoin is worse than fiat
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:39:57
All good man :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:57:08
Unfair yes. Legally, it's how it should work. Law will always prevail over what we may think is 'fair'

In case of an audit, you can easily prove through time stamps of transactions that you've held it for long periods of time.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:37:03
Crypto is used for things other than being a currency 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:45:40
Absolutely, I had to respect your response. Proved me wrong as hell
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:19:10
How useful is the crypto if it's not fiat tho? Sure you can pay for some services for it, but it's not exactly ideal to have crypto over fiat, at least not in today's day and age.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:42:44
People seriously overestimate how easy it would be to turn 100k in crypto into fiat with out raising any red flags
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:24:39
I guess the Board of Directors or solely the trustee. I honestly don't exactly understand how it's going to work, I will admit my comment above is a little too direct... there may be a SLIGHT chance that it's all refunded.
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:11:55
Check out r/buttcoin . It’s an anti crypto sub, so it’s filled with memes shitting on btc but there’s some useful discussion occasionally on there.
For everything in life, you really need to understand both perspectives to be fully knowledgeable on a subject.
