at least the wealth distribution is known. The amount of fiat in circulation is an estimate at best

I think it is important to acknowledge that most people in the world are still primarily subsistence farmers, with almost no access to any financial mechanisms, let alone 1500 dollars.
If you have an hour, you should watch these ted talks from Hans Rosling, 
He has a few more, but this covers the above point pretty succinctly.

It wouldn't be so bad, if they made it clear up front, at deposit time. Instead I think they hope to capitalize on people who aren't willing to hand out their identity to anyone who asks for it. What happens to those orphaned bitcoins in unverified accounts? Also, waiting 20 BCH confirmations is a fucking nightmare for anyone hoping to swing trade.

I expect a correction to the 10d simple moving average, but once it's sub 1k, anything could happen.

We need increased regulation and tougher slaps on wrists

I'm worried about a weak or buggy implementation that breaks down the integrity of the network, or erodes trust. I don't care about the adoption strategy. It's high risk, for a low reward. I'm not critical of the technology, I'm risk averse. I'm not a cryptography person, but there are numerous examples where bad implementations and choices led to flaws in both algorithms, and particular softwares and protocols. ECDSA has been put through the fire with decades of use all over the place, particularly with ssh.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:01:00
But I trust ecdsa, not this other thing. Ecdsa has been battle tested in many crytogrqphic scenarios. I'm not a ludite, mind you, just paranoid.

This whole debacle just reeks of other people messing with my money. Time to spin up a full node just to vote.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:44:24
It's even easier than that, because you can just set up an amazon drop shipping shop, upload a picture, that you may or may not even own, and click a few buttons. Your hands never touch anything other than a keyboard.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:02:20
Sounds scammy
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:09:40
only need the seed word or private keys
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:25:01
No, in this case gdax holds the keys. You could withdraw the money to your own wallet 
You would need to have the bitcoin in the wallet at the time of the fork.
Keep in mind, you are now responsible( or irresponsible) for what happens to your own money, and if there is a computer failure, or you lose access to your password, the jig is up. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:20:08
You load your private keys into wallets that connect to the respective blockchains. Since the address where the coins sit prefork exist in both blockchains they can be spent separately on each blockchain post fork.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:09:28
It's worth mentioning that ETH was born out of forks.
Not that I think this is a good thing, it just is a thing.
Also, if you are risk tolerant you have the opportunity to make a bit of cash when you now have private keys to 2 coins. Many people are moving their money INTO btc from alts to get higher btc volumes pre-forks. This of course is a gamble that speculative value of BOTH coins doesn't just fall through the floor.

nice try nsa, feel free to send me a few test bitcoins as well!
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:04:57
ok, but when do I get my free house, education, and healthcare.... literally my three biggest expenses. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 05:26:12
I'm long on bitcoin. 
It doesn't benefit me to support other cryptos. 
It benefits me to promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:34:13
Well, this is really just a demo, but if I can get a supply chain I want to sell gfx cards and pre-built mining rigs with custom monitoring software. Software is free, but the hardware will cost them.  Currently there is no shop that sells gfx cards with any mining metrics. I plan to test and sell rigs that are pre-configured to have an optimized hashrate for ltc and btc. I already have detailed benchmarks on about 10 cards. In my immediate circle of friends we are over 15GH/s
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:29:45
Getting fiat in and out is difficult, trading there is bot dominated, so in general a standard exchange
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:59:11
We should do this, and sell the dude mining shares to pre-mine his own coin
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:26:32
This is what turned up on a quick google, you be the judge
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:09:07
that is quite reasonable, perhaps will add support for bitstamp, will need to review the tos first
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:43:31
I find the premise exciting.  Would you mind adding a link to your bitcointalk.org forums. I saw the initial project there. 
I work at one of the major web hosts, and I would certainly be interested in contributing a bit. I have a lot of sys-admin and WP experience, although I am more of a RoR dev
I did notice that the default implementation doesn't support increments of 0.00006. I would image that micro transactions would be popular for intangible content, and you might as well build in initial support for the full 0.00000001 transaction range of btc. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:52:46
you are right about the asics, but frankly I can probably ship a 2ghs rig in 2-3 weeks, asics haven't hit the market running, and the demand far outreaches the supply. Further,  I expect people will still mine gpus for other cryptocurrencies. Once the shop is setup and I get my supply chain established I can sell anything. This is really just an experiment anyway.

Just bought a domain, and installed a clean wordpress.  Once propagated, I will give it a go and send some feedback to support
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:30:02
I have been waiting for an implementation that separates the chain from the wallet. Will be installing
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:47:49
yep, I currently mine ltc on my prototype
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:58:02
I'm pissed off at the increasing amount of accounts I have to link to their service to get instant btc. It's like everytime I log in they ask for another method of payment.
