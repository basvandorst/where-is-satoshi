Exactly, some big shot with 50k btc in the vault sure has an incentive to manipulate the exchange rate higher and also encourage investment in the btc space for long term viability.

Were you two on different mobile OS' or something?  Why would he not be able to and you could.  Was he on an updated app?

Isn't that the opposite of the question?

I think he's just trying to play snide to get the point about needing bigger blocks across.

I'm saying, if you want to move small amount out of that paper wallet you'll have to make a new paper wallet every time.  It's a huge hassle.

Well, I mean it mimics the intent of Dorsey himself.  A lot of important people find it a necessary process before they implement bitcoin to their platform.  But sure keep calling them a troll and ignore the issue.

To give "I understand blockchain technology but think Bitcoiners are assholes" dudes something to circlejerk about

It's funny how these sites only see Bitcoin as relevant when the price is high but they don't see an increased profit since they convert it to local currency immediately.
People are truly herd behavior idiots

Airbitz is one of the ugliest wallets I've ever seen. Copay and breadwallet are vastly superior on iOS.

Technically, Coinbase can always access your coins since they are regulated by American law.  So while they may let you have your private key, they can still freeze accounts and they can always move your coin to another address.
Think of a private key like the key to a lockbox full of money.  The more people who have it, the less safe it is.  You generally want to be the only one holding it.

Privacy mostly.  Bitcoin exchanges are usually fine as long as you migrate coins into a wallet you control (if you practice good security and can trust yourself handling it)

It's generally seen as a very poor beginners wallet.  They've had a few flaws in security and general UX difficulties in the past.  I'm not sure if they have updated though.  Last time I used their wallet it was difficult.

No, they are 0.1btc it's just more expensive because it's on a highly secure and regulated exchange

Move to a bank that allows you to move your money where you want.  Credit unions have always treated me much better.
