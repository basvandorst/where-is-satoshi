If you haven't already, read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. 
Puts the global economy into perspective. 
The improvement to BTC's stock-to-flow ratio after the halving is going to be very useful for the global economy. BIG MONEY COMING
Thought - We don't know the consequences of extremely high StF ratios though, like 100+. Gold has almost always had the highest ratio, but in a few years BTC will surpasse it, and eventually all mining will have completed unless the code is updated. The future is going to be exciting that's for sure

We'll bounce off the strong 6k support to 9k. We might continue to move between 6 &amp; 9. Once we're chilling at 9 we jump up and start closing weekly candles in the 13k range. With that happening we're off the to races, testing 20k before breaking it to move onwards 25k plus.
Let's throw some dates out:
9k by EOY 2019
13k by May 2020
20k+ by August 2021
I love downvotes

I believe the following:
We are out of the larger bear market, which bottomed at 3.3k, in the bull phase (but it's all a spectrum). Prior I called for a quick drop to the 6k region after we first jumped down to 8k, but if you look at the charts BTC likes to stabilize within a range for about a month at a time. So instead we didn't drop quick, but after about a month we hopped down to 7.2k and then shot up to the 9k bracket which was my prediction following the 6-7k drop.
It's time for us to leave this mini bear downtrend. Around the end of November I believe we'll move up to 13k, just under the 14k spike. At low 9k the one year graph for BTC will look fantastic (up ~300%) to the average investor. At 13k it starts to look incredible.
After 13k we've broken resistance. We'll probably stay there a bit, go to a close-yet-still-distant under 20k, and then break 20k with a leap to 25k. After 25k it's hard to confidently predict the shorter term price movements, but I think this bull market will take us ultimately to 400k in a couple years. We're moving faster than before but also on a larger scale.
Note- If we drop to 6k by end of November, the sine pattern will have completely symmetrically, and the 1yr will show up 200%, plus we'll have strong support to jump off of, but it's too big a step back at this point. The sine pattern needs to break upwards asymmetrically towards the positive. BTC's recent 40% pump is proof that we have left the 6-8k region

Yeah 2022. Until the transaction fees per block are less than the amount of BTC mined I think these halving cycles will continue growing the price in sequence unless a very large macro event is to occur.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:02:18
Lol now everyone is calling 4k or lower. Nubs
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:07:04
I think this will age like a fine Cabernet Sauvignon

Bitcoin has this attitude like "nothing can grow on me rn", but the market really needs to let the alts grow on the ratio.
BCH is in a unusual position because it's an alt that directly competes with BTC, and BTC maximalists typically want to see that ratio low. But it'll go up on the ratio if the other alts, XRP and ETH leading, continue to do so.
So BTC, please let BCH grow for a bit, and everyone else too :)
Keep in mind, Bitcoin explodes when it supports a larger crypto economy rather than BEING the crypto economy

Incredible pump. One of the best BTC has had in a day.
XRP will be a better fall

This is a good sign that they expect a large increase in price soon as they wouldn't raise fees unless they expected to generate more revenue from this than revenue lost from lost traders.
New traders won't care.

With economic uncertainty in China, BTC miners there are accumulating their last stash of BTC before they sell some in the last of the bear market dumps.
After that, historically we've seen that miners will wait out a halving in order to sell at the newly established prices, prices which don't affect their bottom line. I believe this will happen again.
With miners likely selling little over the next year, but worldwide buy pressure only increasing, the price has one way to go... the train is about to leave the station, and there is no going back to these prices soon.

We haven't broken UP from the channel yet so it's still a strong possibility we move DOWN. I thought it was going to drop faster but those in crypto do like to suffer over long durations it seems ��‍♀️

Oh for sure BTC could go sideways at 10k for the next five years and that would be amazing for it's adoption. A stable 10k permission-less decentralized store of value through a recession would be highly valued.
If BTC goes up over five years then that's even better.
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:01:28
Agree on all points.
Puts BTC in a pretty good position considering those economics at play, and especially all the local on ramps you can find for BTC around the world
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:38:23
"lol" blacked out yet??
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:49:06
But it causes the exchanges to buy taphead.gif
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:11:23
All of the above would be terrible if not fatal for Bitcoin smh
That level of volatility would give people zero faith in Bitcoin as a SoV
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:29:09
Bitcoin will at least reach the same total valuation as gold (currently 10 tril mcap) within 6 years.
That seems like a long time but in reality that is very rapid adoption

Everything checks out
@_date: 2019-10-29 06:12:12
Big movement happening within the week
@_date: 2019-09-29 04:13:18
You good bro! Buy lower in a couple days.
@_date: 2019-09-20 04:54:18
And that's exactly where this money will go. 
A small amount is routed through Ripple, eventually finding it's way back to BTC, creating wealth in the crypto community while driving spending back home in the states.
@_date: 2019-09-26 05:01:08
This is dope, nice work!
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:43:52
Bitcoin is going to 6k within 2 days
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:27:31
Aaaand that's why it'll go there. We spent 12 months LOCKING down 6k during the bear. We'll land back to jump up next. Look at the BTC current 1yr chart. Completion of a beautiful sin wave
