Yeah i sold my bitcoins at 47 a few weeks ago too. I'm bad luck, sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:42:46
I get my bitcoins sent to the wallet by  When you make an account you should see a bitcoin address on your account page (this is where you will want your money sent to - and you can send it to other wallets or mxgox or wherever). 
If you want to buy from Blue Sky Traders email them at bitcoinage and let them know how much money you want to spend. They'll most likely reply tomorrow morning giving you his account info and you just fill out a bank deposit slip at any BoA and once it gets confirmed you will have bitcoins in your digital wallet.
*If you do order from them now make sure to put Early Order $XXXX in the subject.

I buy them from Blue Sky Traders. It's just a simple bank deposit at Bank of America and you should have your coins by the time you get home, no identification required. Message me if you want more details or their email/.onion site.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:56
i got mine early this morning. tell me about it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:25

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:19:53
i spent $2000 today and now im a broke college student and will hold my 8 bitcoins no matter what, even if their worthless, for i believe in the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:51
i hope your right
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:35:52
Try bank deposits at Bank Of America. Blue Sky Traders is a good.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:53:46
A cash deposit at Bank of America with Blue Sky Traders is how I usually buy bitcoins. I email them the night before, deposit the cash when I get the confirmation email the next morning, and I have bitcoins by the time I get back home.
