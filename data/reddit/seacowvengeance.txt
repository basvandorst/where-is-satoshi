- Blockchain.info: Online wallet that's easy to use, and is relatively secure (you maintain private key ownership).
- Electrum: Desktop/mobile "light" wallet that doesn't require you to download the entire blockchain, and allows easy recovery with a passphrase.

This was a widespread issue for man sites, specifically affecting Chrome and Safari. [Here's the fix](

Yes. They've added a feature called instant buy that allows the transaction to take place within hours. You need a credit card on file though.

I couldn't agree more. I stopped having fun in a long time ago. has restored my faith in crypto currencies. There is a community that is actually passionate about the currency and not making a short term investment.
+50 doge

I like this idea. The bit should be programmed for tip users that have accounts more than few months old. Particularly that mention bitcoin at random. Are you going to be programming this or are you asking someone else to? If you're doing it, open source it and I'd be glad to help

I agree getting rid of the top gradient will make it look more clean and professional. The work you have now is great, just needs to look a bit brighter to give it a better image in my opinion.

I think he meant more along the lines of defacing (aka writing or stamping anything on U.S. dollars) is illegal.

What? Pretty sure there's plenty poker sites already put there (ex one popular app on Facebook) that lets you gamble online and trade in chips for cash.

I'm curious how you can pull of buying ANYTHING except the four things you mentioned with BTC. How do you buy food with BTC? Clothes? Entertainment? Not trying to call you out, just genuinely curious since I have no idea how that's possible at the moment.

If you're serious I hope you're really thinking this through...until restaurants/grocery stores accept BTC wide-scale, unless you still have a stable source of USD income, you might starve in the meantime.

This is huge, I can only hope that at least some of these people  know what bitcoin is and are willing to use it as payment. Thing is, if mainstream places like this put effort into something like this and 0 people end up using it, others will see implementing bitcoin payment systems as a waste of time and money. If someone here is going to this college, please pay support it!

Do you get paid in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:08:59
As i understand it, blocks of transactions are securely confirmed by mining. What happens when nearly all the bitcoins hit the market, and there's no incentive to mine anymore? With a big market and no one to confirm transactions, I suspect trouble.
Also, I heard somewhere on here bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second. Doesn't sound like high volume.
