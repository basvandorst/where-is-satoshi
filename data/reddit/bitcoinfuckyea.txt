If your bank locked up your money for weeks without providing you any reason, or timeline for when you would have it returned, and the only reason they finally gave it back was because you caused them lots of negative publicity would you thank them?

The Core wallet does not work completely in the non-GUI version either. There is no way to have the wallet automatically generate Segwit change addresses when creating a transaction. You can create a Segwit receive address but as soon as you send out any received coin to another address your change ends up going to a non-Segwit address anyways so there’s really no point. 
It’s not ready yet, and isn’t expected to be until 0.16 release which isn’t expected for at least 4-5 months still.

Was there no contact information anywhere on or near the machine with the name of the person/company that runs the machine? Your best bet would be to try and reach the entity in charge of running the bitcoin ATM. If there is no contact info that you can find ask the location where it is hosted to put you in touch with the owner(s).
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:57:59
Well I think you're on the right track but not quite there.
Assuming your model of 10 machines, a few of your figures are off. Rent would be $5K per month, not $0.5K, and you will be hard pressed to find any reputable company to service 10 machines regularly for $2k a month. But let's assume you do, and that your running costs for 10 machines are only $7000/month.
***You are still ignoring the biggest issue which is the bitcoin liquidity and float that is required to run a Bitcoin ATM business successfully***. To scale to 5 machines or 10 machines requires a significant amount of bitcoins that must be available to the operator at market price or very close to it.
Anyone running multiple machines in Canada and the United States will attest to the fact that holding tens of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin in float and being susceptible to large swings in price (historically downwards) is not an easy pill to swallow. Operators must charge a significant markup because they must continuously source coins and many times they are unable to source coins at market rate, instead having to pay up to 5-7% premium just to have enough coins for their customers.
Most operators are unable to just go buy online at Coinbase or Bitstamp or any other exchange due to the issue that North American banks have with accepting large amounts of cash deposits. An operator cannot take the $30K that his machine brings in every month, go deposit it in the bank, and wire that money to an exchange and buy coins at market price. If anyone is doing that, they are not doing it for very long. Sure it will work for 1 month or maybe even 6 but eventually the banks will cite "increased risk" and shut your account down. Now imagine an operator with 5 machines or 10 machines, trying to deposit $150k or $300k, respectively, in cash every single month at their bank. Do you know of many banks that will accept that for very long?
The general public doesn't realize that many operators charging 7% markup are doing so at significant cost to themselves (probably not paying themselves an equitable wage for their time/investment) or they are doing small enough volume where they are able to maintain a banking relationship and have not had their accounts shut down. But with 10 machines, as in your example, there is no way that would work for very long.
Many of the operators that I have spoken to have echoed the same exact sentiment -- find us an unlimited source of coins at market rate, that we can buy with cash, and we will charge less than 5% forever. 
Of course this isn't the reality yet and operators are forced to purchase coins above market rates and in large quantities when they are available so that they will have enough coins for their customers. This requires carrying a float and being susceptible to market volatility, and this is the largest reason many operators are required to charge higher fees.
If the Bitcoin ATMs business were as profitable as most people think, it would not have taken over 2 years to reach only 500 machines worldwide. That is a drop in the bucket and markets are efficient -- if there really was so much money to be made, we would see a much higher number of machines deployed by now, and almost no machine or Bitcoin ATM company would have gone out of business, but of course we know that is not what has happened.
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:21:53
Thank you for the reply, this is a very interesting discussion.
Unfortunately here in Canada and the US, most Bitcoin ATM Operators cannot sustain any sort of banking relationship when their monthly sales volume exceeds a certain threshold. Even with all proper compliance (AML/KYC), and legal paperwork done, banks still get to decide who they will and will not do business with. In fact in November 2014, [FinCEN issued a statement to banks]( telling them that they should not be indiscriminately denying banking services to Money Service Businesses (MSBs). It is well known that banks will shut down accounts or outright deny an account to businesses that are properly registered as an MSB which led FinCEN to issue this advisory.
Unfortunately the regulatory landscape in North America is such that the banks are not only required to know their customer, but also their customer's customer, and therefore for most banks, the reward of providing banking services to an MSB is just not worth the risk. The banks see a large amount of cash being deposited to an account every month and this triggers their automated system. The MSB's account is then reviewed by a human and usually ends up with the business losing their banking relationship.
What operators are largely left with is trying to survive as an unbanked business. This means operators must purchase bitcoins on localbitcoins via cash deposit into another bank customer's account, or try to find miners or other sellers locally.
This splits the BATM operator market into two dichotomies. The first group is the small time operators who are doing $30k or less per month, and are able to maintain a banking relationship and buy coins from online exchanges without having their banks shut down their accounts. These operators are able to easily purchase at market price, or very close to it, and can charge 5-10% on top of it and do very well. They can even have their machines purchase the coin immediately when the customer buys from the machine and therefore protect themselves from any market volatility risk.
The second group is the BATM operators who have multiple machines and are doing a larger amount of volume and therefore cannot consistently sustain a banking relationship due to the larger amount of cash that they are turning over. Unfortunately for them, they also cannot buy bitcoin with their cash every single day as they are at the mercy of local sellers and their own supply constraints. Instead, these operators must purchase coins at whatever rate and quantity that is available to them, whenever it is available, and try to accurately predict the demand for coins at their machines while also worrying about market volatility between the time when they purchase coins and when they are able to sell them. These operators are at the mercy of market volatility and must hold a larger amount of coins in their wallet because they do not have any consistently reliable source of coins at a consistently reliable rate. They can easily purchase coins and see 5% volatility in price between the time they purchased coins and the time they arrived home. Because these operators have limited avenues to purchase coins, and have no exchange access due to their monetary supply being largely in cash, they must charge a larger fee to mitigate the potential losses due to holding a large float. In your example you say worst case scenario their float decreases in value by 50% over a year, but this is very inaccurate. They are purchasing a few percentage points above market and then the price drops 5-10% in the matter of a few hours. If they try to sell for 5-10% above the new market price, they are basically keeping their machines on at a complete loss.
Hopefully the banking situation will change in North America, but currently as it is, most operators belong to one of the two groups outlined above and must set their fees accordingly, in order to make it worth their time and efforts.

If you think Bitcoin ATM operators and individuals who sell on LocalBitcoins have even close to the same fixed costs and overhead, then with all due respect, you are very uninformed about the way the Bitcoin ATM business works.
Individuals selling on LocalBitcoins.com have very few costs and are charging around 10% above market. They pay no rent, regulatory/compliance fees, and probably also little to no taxes on their income. They provide little to no support, no call-in helpline, and have no continuous hardware and software costs.
How can you expect a Bitcoin ATM operator to have the same price structure as someone sitting in their mother's basement selling bitcoin whenever they feel like it?

The customer was trying to cash out $180 and says he paid a valid miner fee. Coinsource should just allow him to get his cash without waiting on a confirmation on an amount so small. Many bitcoin ATMs do this but apparently Coinsource ones do not. There are plenty of ways to know with a strong confidence level that a transaction will confirm before it actually does and this converts into a significantly better customer experience.

You can buy 10 brand new Genesis Bitcoin ATMs, delivered for free anywhere in North America for less than $70k. BitAccess machines are not reliable and full of bugs and other issues. The company barely sells them anymore. 
Also the fees which they charge in ongoing royalties to the operator are super high. 
But of course buying a bitcoin ATM is the smallest cost anyone will face if they are trying to start a bitcoin ATM business. Compliance legal fees, support staff, maintenance, insurance, rents, vandalism repairs, etc are much bigger.

Your first mistake is expecting it to work like a fiat ATM. Fiat ATMs are not doing currency exchange, they are simply giving you money that you already own and charging a fee for the infrastructure costs that your bank pays to maintain their ATM network. 
Try to tell a foreign currency exchange business to just charge you $5 over the spot rate and see how well that goes. 
I think you need to step back and make an honest attempt at understanding the Bitcoin ATM business model. Comparing the fees with Coinbase shows you haven't done your homework.

The cheapest part about running a bitcoin ATM business is the cost of the machine. There are so many other costs involved that the only way to cover your expenses and make a profit is by charging high fees.
Before you begin make sure you consult with a lawyer and figure out exactly what you need to do to make sure you are compliant at the federal and state level (if you're in the US).
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:50:52
4% makes sense to *you*, not to the market itself.
If bitcoin ATM operators could charge 4% and still make money, someone would be selling coin at 4%, and conquering the entire industry.
The fees at bitcoin ATMs will never be more than someone is willing to pay. The fact that they exist means there is demand for bitcoin at that price.

There are fees involved with buying from an exchange which aren't listed in the exchange's price. You have to wire or ACH money from your bank account which is neither fast or free.
Then you have the risk that the exchange will steal your money or your coins or that they will be hacked.
Also you have to worry that your bank won't shut your account down for buying bitcoin. On top of that you need to trust the exchange with all kinds of personal information about yourself (passport, drivers license, utility bill, some even ask for a selfie...)
So the basic reason is that after you take everything into account, the premium charged at the ATMs is not that unreasonable and people want to be able to get bitcoin quickly without jumping through all those hoops.

Your fault. Accept some personal responsibility for not knowing what you're doing.
Next time go sign up at Coinbase, hand over all your personal information, wait 5 days, have them cancel your order, then wait 3 more days for them to reply to your email asking you what's the issue, then come here and complain about Coinbase, have their reddit support tell you to email them again, wait another 2 days for your issue to be resolved and then finally get your coins. Also, Coinbase also charges fees on top of their advertised rate.
Or just use a bitcoin ATM, pay a premium and learn more about the business model that you're so quick to criticize before you post.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:13:21

You got $194 for $200 and you think the fees are ridiculous? That is only 3%. You paid 3% for something that has gone up more than that in the last 2 hours. 
When it comes to buying bitcoin you can either get cheap, or you can get fast. You somehow got both and you still think the fees are ridiculous?
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:50:48
I have tried it a few times in the past 6 months and every time they have asked for ID. The way it has worked for me is if I'm the account holder, they want me to slide my debit card and enter in my PIN to make the deposit. If I can't do that, they assume its not my account.
Once they know its not my account, if its a personal account they tell me no cash allowed, buy a money order, or if its a business account they allow it but only with ID.
Never had any luck doing it without ID so thats why I was curious as to how you're able to. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:28:12
The effectively high exchange rate is likely due to the fact that as mentioned, the cost to send your transaction on the bitcoin network is so costly currently that when the ATM deducts the miner fee on top of the ATM operator's commission the effective exchange rate jumps up very high. But you bought $60, not an entire bitcoin so although you may have paid an exchange rate over $7000, that is more a fault of the high fees and huge backlog on the network right now, not the ATM operator gouging you.
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:34:05
don't you need to show your ID to make a cash deposit at a Chase Bank? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:21:26
Do this. It will be a great way for you to realize how expensive it is to actually operate a bitcoin ATM business and how much financial, legal, and logistical risk the operator takes on so that people can buy bitcoin instantly with cash, in less than 5 minutes. 
And if you're right, then you should be an overnight success and you will get all of your competition's customers because you will be the only one doing it cheaper/faster/better. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:56:29
This isn't correct. Costs increase based on the number of transactions AND the volume of each individual transaction.
There's more to a bitcoin ATM business than plugging in your exchange account credentials on a machine. If that was all that was involved, you're right it would make no difference how much bitcoin someone was buying. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:09:28

Why do you think there are so few providers currently? There must be some sorts of barriers to entry, correct? Those barriers are risk, costs, and logistics.
No viable business will charge more than what their customers are willing to pay. You were willing to pay that fee so your post title accusing bitcoin ATM companies of thievery comes across as a little bit click-baity and disingenuous.
I personally don't use bitcoin ATMs because I have the ability to earn btc via work that I do, but I do see the value that they provide.

Think of the bitcoin ATMs more as currency exchanging vending machines and not bank owned ATMs. Banks can afford to charge only a fixed fee on transactions, they're simply giving you ***your own*** money.
Bitcoin ATMs are converting your fiat cash for bitcoin and therefore are unable to charge only a flat fee for the service. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:06:13
Sorry, but it really doesn't sound like you got scammed. You received bitcoin instantly without having to jump through any hoops or wait for any delays and you got to purchase it with cash.
Compared to the markup you pay for a gallon of milk at the grocery store, you actually did pretty well here.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:15:37
Well the answer is because it would never work. Online exchanges and local exchanges (bitcoin ATMs) both have costs which increase proportionally with their transaction volume. Having a fixed fee would quickly put them out of business. 
It is like going to a restaurant and asking everyone to pay the same amount no matter what they order. The restaurant could just come up with a fee that would cover their average order and make everyone pay that.
They could have a huge Grand Opening, followed a few weeks later with a huge Grand Closing. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:34:13
This is where you're wrong. It definitely costs them more on a transaction of 500 BTC vs 100 BTC. Is it 5x more? Probably not exactly, but it is definitely much more costly than a transaction 1/5th the amount.
You are ignoring all of the costs involved in running any business in general and specifically the unique costs involved in running a bitcoin ATM business. 
If it was as easy as you believe it to be, there would be much less risk involved and way more competition than there currently exists. 
Back to the restaurant analogy, why does it cost a restaurant more to serve 5 people versus 1 person? The same reasons apply to this. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:35:21

Also be well aware of the fact that no bank will want to do business with you as soon as they find out you are a bitcoin business.

A lot of owners would probably love to charge less but they just aren't able to do so due to the expenses involved in running the business. An owner has to worry about rent, compliance/legal costs, backend server and maintenance costs, and also the cost of sourcing BTC reliably and without too much volatility.

They went from 19 or so Bitcoin ATMs to now only having 5 that are *sometimes* online. All in the course of less than 6 months.
They also are in a dispute with ExpressCoin, the exchange they were relying on, and last I heard still owe ExpressCoin money.

Agreed. Skyhooks are plagued with problems. Some operators have been able to get theirs to work but they just aren't very reliable. But if you were going to be at the location yourself every day then your machine doesn't have to be super reliable anyways.

Interesting to see what will happen to [BitStop]( now. They just spent a good amount of money expanding in that area with bitcoin ATMs.
LibertyX is kind of a flaky company though IMHO, they tried the QPay thing and it seemed to have been mostly a fail. They had a ton of locations in my area and now there are only a handful left and even going there is a hit or miss. So when they advertise 19,000 locations, I'm guessing that many of those have either never made a single bitcoin sale, or are no longer functioning.
Also LibertyX's pricing is not transparent by any means and they change the rate they charge on you, increasing their price if you buy more. It's like the opposite of volume discounting.

OP I have to respectfully disagree. There are not "tons of small companies in the Bay Area that fit this description". There is actually exactly 1 company on CoinATMRadar that fits this description and it is CoinWorks. 
You stated in another comment that all of your machines except for one are already on CoinATMRadar. There's no other company in the Bay Area using General Bytes with a CoinATMRadar presence at the moment. runs CoinATMRadar and can probably confirm this as well.
Why would a Bitcoin ATM Operator do an AMA but then not want any publicity for their company?
If you are CoinWorks, which it seems pretty obvious you are, you should definitely get your registration done ASAP. CoinWorks is **NOT registered with FinCEN**, so I would recommend you get that taken care of as the fines and jail time for not being compliant are pretty crazy.

Eric Grill scammed a few other bitcoin ATM operators early last year, selling them used bitcoin ATM hardware that was damaged and missing vital components.
I don't remember the names of the companies that got scammed by him but they had posted long complaints about it in a bitcoin ATM operators slack group. If I recall, he used old pictures to misrepresent the state in which the items he was selling were in and had promised certain key components were included with the sale and then never delivered them.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:49:25
Used to be in the bitcoin atm industry and one of the reasons the fees are so high is because the companies putting these ATMs out there have really high expenses, especially with legal and compliance fees. I am sure most would love to be able to lower their pricing and do way more volume in sales, but they just aren't able to. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:13:02
Fair enough. OP has given enough details about his business to make it obvious that he is CoinWorks, but they actually don't have the proper legal registration completed so it seems that is why he is trying to now claim that it is not his company.

Coinsource's ATMs have a camera inside which is activated as soon as you touch the screen to begin the buy process. It then takes pictures of you and anyone standing near you multiple times throughout the entire process. 
The pictures are tagged to your specific transaction and it is very easy for them to quickly review those pictures and see if they match up with the information that you have given them when you created the account. Pictures from your previous transactions are also tagged so they can quickly compare who used that account the previous time.
If you're not comfortable with that, don't use Coinsource's ATMs. Not all ATMs do this, but most of the ones that use the same manufacturer that Coinsource does (Genesis Bitcoin ATMs) do use this feature. 
General Bytes and Lamassu Bitcoin ATMs do not take pictures of you throughout the entire process.

You have to remember that most people are not buying an entire bitcoin from a bitcoin ATM. Instead they're typically buying $40 or less. The high markup you see seems really high if you were to buy an entire bitcoin, but for the small transactions that bitcoin ATMs experience, it amounts to a few dollars of a fee. If bitcoin ATMs were doing much larger transactions, they could charge way less of a fee and the volume would make up for it.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:33:23

@_date: 2017-09-14 03:40:10
There's a lot of costs involved in operating a Bitcoin ATM that you just probably haven't considered. 
Couple that with the average transaction at these machines being between $5-$25, if they do not inflate their asking price by a significant amount, they can't make enough money to cover their expenses. 
Charging 10-20% markup on a $20 transaction doesn't seem like anything close to a scam unless our definitions of what a scam entails are wildly different. The markup you are paying for a gallon of milk at the grocery store is much higher.

Used to be in the industry. Tons of headache and legal/compliance costs along with a lot of gray area on regulation which does not help things at all. 
Once you do shell out a ton of money to get your compliance program, running a cash heavy business in general is costly and difficult. 
Also the bitcoin volatility risk that you will encounter -- many bitcoin companies cannot secure banking relationships and therefore cannot buy from an online exchange. You will have to purchase bitcoin and hold it and hope that by the time you sell it, the price hasn't tanked on you.
Legal/compliance + bitcoin volatility means that if you do enter the industry, you better have deep pockets. 
My experience is specific to the US. In other countries with way less regulation, the business can be much more lucrative.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:11:43
It's not possible to insert more cash than the required amount -- there is no required amount, unless you mean you were trying to get a certain amount and you received more? 
Bitcoin ATMs let you insert cash first and then send you the amount of bitcoin that corresponds to how much cash you inserted minus the fee charged by the bitcoin ATM company. Fees are typically in the 10-20% range.

That's just how bitcoin transactions work. They are broadcast, and then take time to confirm. There is no delay for broadcasting them so the bitcoin ATM simply broadcasts them instantly. Some third party services such as Coinbase, Localbitcoins.com, etc will not broadcast a transaction right away but will instead wait until they have multiple customers' transactions and will then bulk broadcast them in the same transaction so that they can save on miner fees. Bitcoin ATMs generally don't do this so you see the transaction show up instantly.

Not to be a naysayer but this is a bad idea. Cash logistics are already one of the most expensive costs that bitcoin ATM operators have to deal with. 
Accepting loose coins for very little upside doesn't make good business sense. The average person who is looking to buy bitcoin with loose change is probably going to be buying less than $100. It isn't worth the extra cost involved in developing, testing, and manufacturing a bitcoin machine that can accept, sort, count and safely store loose change just for the few extra bucks that it may bring in. Also retail space in high density metropolitan areas trades at a very high premium so any machine that will be using up floor space needs to be as compact and efficiently designed as possible. Having a larger machine just so that it can store that extra hardware to accept loose change isn't very profitable.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:37:19
Can you be more specific regarding city/state that you're going to be operating in. Recommendations can be given based upon that. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:12:47
No that isn't what's happening. The bitcoin ATM sends the coin to your wallet instantly however it is still pending on the blockchain and has not confirmed. Depending upon how high of a fee the bitcoin ATM company pays to send your transaction you can have it confirm on the very next block if they pay a high miner fee or not in the first block if they are not paying high miner fees. 
You see it show up instantly, but it isn't actually confirmed instantly.

@_date: 2017-09-04 03:44:46
Yes most operators are taking one or multiple exchanges' pricing and then adding their fees/commissions/etc on top of that and arriving at a final sell price, just like any other retail business does with any product that they sell.

Athena could pay a higher fee to send the transaction and target next-block confirmation. They probably are just trying to save on miner fees.

Depends entirely on which app you are using as your bitcoin wallet. If you are using the app of an online provider such as Coinbase, then even though the bitcoin are on your app, you don't control the private keys to those coins, Coinbase does. If on the other hand you are using a bitcoin app such as Mycelium, you control the keys.

Haha, the person you're replying to, runs the company that owns the ATM you had an issue with.
My guess on what happened is that XBTeller's ATM wallet was configured in a way where it was spending its own unconfirmed change outputs. Due to the malleability attack that has been taking place, the transaction ID changed on one of the unconfirmed outputs they spent when you bought your coins. They probably used an unconfirmed output which ended up not being mined and therefore was never included in a block. Since your transaction was a child of that transaction, it also never made it into a block and you never received your coins.
Best way to prevent this would be to not spend unconfirmed change while this attack is continuing.

Thanks for sharing. Have heard similar stories about Marco Santori from some others who reached out to him for legal advice in the past. He just seems like a huge opportunist and like you experienced, provides very little value. Back when he was charging Bitcoin ATM operators $15k for those letters, he wasn't even accepting bitcoin himself and his grasp of the fundamentals behind bitcoin was very superficial at best. Guy was just trying to make a quick buck in a niche where he saw little competition.

You're right. It is because Athena Bitcoin did not pay an appropriate miner/network fee when sending your transaction, whereas RockitCoin did pay an appropriate fee. 
Athena is probably just trying to save money on miner fees and the downside of that is that you as the customer end up having to wait hours for the coins to arrive.

The business has a lot of risks and costs involved which you as a consumer don't see. Your comment about Bitcoin ATM networks having "literally zero backend infrastructure to maintain" shows how little you understand the business.
Do you think bitcoin ATMs and regular ATMs are basically the same thing? They're not. One gives you your own money, the other is selling you a product, similar to a foreign currency exchange. 
Take some time to understand the business model and all the overhead involved before you express your outrage that the fees are too damn high.
