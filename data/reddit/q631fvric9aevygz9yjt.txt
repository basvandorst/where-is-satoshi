I would still pick the cheapest airport. Skipping a meal is no big deal. Same with skipping a trip just for a Bit Coin ATM. I can run to a real ATM, deposit cash, and use Coinbase or another service to get my Bit Coins. Much more convenient.
You're right, I don't use Bit Coin now. There's not much to use them for, beyond NewEgg, Overstock, and black markets. I do still have some from when I was mining them. Had 3 miners with 3 7950s each.

If you aren't one of those who mined their coins or purchased them on Local Bit Coins, then you'll likely have to go through an exchange who will require all the same information.
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:16:14
Yea! With Bit Coin you can instantly purchase alpaca socks, computer parts, child pornography, and drugs.

I'm pretty sure real GDP has been increasing. i.e. GDP is increasing faster than inflation.

@_date: 2015-07-02 08:15:49
It's in the graph I linked. Real GDP is *literally* GDP adjusted for inflation.
E: The graph is adjusted for inflation. If inflation was out-pacing GDP, it'd have a negative slope.

Just look at Bit Coin's success with the MyBus app for ACTION buses in Australia. [In nine months, 23 of the 3249 transactions were Bit Coin transactions.]( When the Bit Coin payment option was taken down for maintenance, they ["received about 30 emails from people asking for it to be reinstalled which is odd because that's more people than have actually used the feature."]( If that's not HIGH DEMAND, then I don't know what is.
