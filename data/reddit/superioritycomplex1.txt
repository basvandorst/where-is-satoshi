I know I made a decent amount on Bitcoin, I paid 120$ for a ledger nano s and I'd easy pay 15 plus dollars for a great Android wallet app.

just so i know, and feel safe with the few coins i have (i just started buying some bitcoins) do i need to do anything to my bitcoin wallet after this happens? i use mycelium on android.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:34:52
Oh? I sure hope mines fine.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:11:27
Random question, I use mycelium on Android, why don't you trust Android?
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:43:49
ok thanks you, i have about 250$ worth of bitcoin and was planing to pick up more, but i think im going to wait it out as this all scares me.

As far as I know, it has no way to connect to the internet. But you can connect it to usb on a pc. For updates and such. I don't have a trezor, I only have about 100usd in bit coin cause I believe in Bitcoin. So if I'm wrong, that's why
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:11:29
im still a noob myself, but ive found the ATMs around me have a fee of 10%

A hardware wallet (trezer or another) with no internet connection (Dosent have wifi or any other way to connect to the internet) nonsms 2fa (two factor authentication that does not text your phone with a text message, such as Google authenticer app on Android on another device, so not on the hardware wallet it self. Hope this helps, there's alot of complex things with Bitcoin.
