If they're reselling cards for more than NewEgg charges then why are people buying them off eBay?

Oh, wow, I didn't realize it was that bad. Really hope my 970 doesn't poop out before GPU prices are a little bit more sane because there's no way I'd pay those outrageous prices.

Yeah that's one of the big perks.
Slightly high fees though, and still no SegWit. Which is extremely disappointing. Otherwise I love them.

Winklevoss Twin fanboys I guess is the reason for the recent love for Gemini.
I agree is Gemini isn't the greatest, but neither are any of the other major exchanges. Out of all of them, I think Gemini is the best choice currently (at least for those in the US). Even with all the downsides you mentioned.

Just use [cryptowat.ch]( It's superior to every exchange's interface anyways.

open source doesn't mean bug free. it just means that the source code is open to audit freely by anyone at anytime (among other things). and if such a gaping security hole were in the source code, it would have been found ages ago.

thanks for the well thought out and convincing argument dude. going to sell all my bitcoin now

Just spent about 150 USD worth of Bitcoin on overstock last night. Now if only Amazon would hop on the Bitcoin train.

corrected that for you

Only buy what you can afford to lose.
Sounds like you can't afford to lose that money. So I would suggest you buy only a little at a time, 50 bucks or so at a time. Whatever your budget will allow.

Read his blog post: 
Wonder how it feels to be so wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:12:51
No. I wonder if it is due to higher fees, or people wanting to hold on to their bitcoin. Probably both.

Paper wallet, or if he has a smart phone set him up with a proper wallet and demo the process for him (don't forget to help him back up his key).
And also give him 20 dollars cash too. Bitcoin is cool and sharing it is cool, but he's a little kid so give him something to buy something from the sweet shop or whatever the fuck those people buy these days.

I recently made a (test) transaction the other week with a fee of 0.00000001 bitcoin. Took a real long time to go through, but it did.
Unless you're making a transaction that absolutely must be confirmed as soon as possible there's no reason why you have to set the fee so high.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:12
Because very few people use them. Let me know when any of those alt-coins have even half the amount of usage Bitcoin has and I will.

Unless the HD itself fried, it should be fine. I've had motherboards, PSUs, and entire laptops fry up and almost in flames and the hard drive was always fine.

If I have to send something that needs to be confirmed quickly I use this site:  and base my fee off that. It tells you the cheapest and fastest fee.
Otherwise I just sent it with a 30 satoshis per byte fee. On a full day it may take several hours, but usually gets a couple confirmations in an hour or so.
