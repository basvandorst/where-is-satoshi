Remember, 21 one days ago i paid à calculator with exams mode to my Mathematics Teacher in BTC. The price was 60€ in BTC when it was 7000€/BTC. Today she brings the new calculators and she gave me the most expensive one (TI NSPIRE ~120€) instead of TI-82 STATS because of the  price increase (Today 15000€/BTC) !
(Sorry for my english i'm French)

Thanks, i have a ledger nano S so i will store this btc on. 
So the most secure solution is à legacy address for long term ? I understand Segwit is for lower fees. 
But if there is hardforks or other things they fork from Segwit or legacy chain ?

Why you can't withdraw ETH ?
