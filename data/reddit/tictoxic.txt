If you're just going to argue semantics about the word "cost" then what's the point - we were talking about fees in the context of the thread and I fed the troll (you) and acknowledged that costs could be an umbrella term including labor.


It's a good option for every consumer who has ever knowingly bought anything that had a No Returns policy, otherwise they would've shopped elsewhere.  Sales speak for themself.


Citation needed.  Also, I AM a merchant and I prefer BTC. Even if I didn't I could always change my BTC right over to fiat.


Even if it's not, what harm is there in putting your products on another platform when the labor cost is minimal and the tangible cost is $0?  Also, there are MANY markets where there simply is no competition - OB will be the only game in town.  I'll let you think about which.
I guess your ultimate point is that I'm actually acting against my own rational self-interest in using OB and you want to help me?  Congratulations!  You've now taken up more of my time (labor) than it took me to create my OB page.
@_date: 2016-04-06 03:47:49
Way ahead of you:  I've just started with OB while the site is many months old so really no way to compare yet but if I'm going with Sales Per Day, right now OB is doing better.
Point is, having your products on multiple platforms is not "dumb", especially when the cost is free in money and negligible in time.
@_date: 2016-04-06 01:43:43
I just went to that site for the first time.  Unless I'm missing something, there were all of 13 items for sale.
@_date: 2016-04-05 02:31:41
Why not?  There are real merchants selling real goods that really accept Bitcoin.  For example I could buy up all the inventory of Newegg or Tiger Direct or Overstock.

Which arguments are straw?
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:06:09
He had to convert to a fiat debit card so his purchase WAS censorable and on top of that he paid a fee to do so.  That's why it's so uninteresting when compared with the truly revolutionary aspects of bitcoin.  If he had been an unbanked person who had mined coins or had been converting cash to Bitcoin locally and used that to reserve the car directly with Tesla, THAT would be noteworthy.
@_date: 2016-04-09 01:17:24
Hodl on to your bits!
@_date: 2016-04-06 03:42:51
You *are* missing that I was genuinely throwing out the caveat that I might've been navigating the site wrong and hence missing seeing all the items.
I have a feeling that site is somehow precious to you.  Don't worry I won't be using it now!
PS. Superior tech is just one of many factors people use in determining which platform is "better" than another - not that anyone but you is even arguing about the "tech" levels of the 2 platforms.
@_date: 2016-04-01 00:52:02
Ok so if I'm buying something in another country that requires a face to face meeting I want to be paid with one of these rather than a trezor.  I guess I can give you that.  Still seems quite niche, like I said.  The cost of these would have to become basically negligible to be much more useful and I don't think they will be able to reach the economy of scale for that to happen due to aforementioned limited use cases.
@_date: 2016-04-02 22:33:07

Can you point me to somewhere I can see these promises they made that aren't being delivered on?  I don't recall being promised anything other than what it already is.

@_date: 2016-04-06 03:30:16
I know all about labor costs - but really it took less than 10 minutes to make my shop and listing so I consider the labor cost to be negligible.  I don't offer returns.  I haven't had any issues or needed to do any troubleshooting - my first sale went beautifully and I already have the Bitcoin in my wallet.  Most of the issues you mention are true of any online platform, anyway.  Even USD changes in value daily.
I'm wondering what is your ultimate point here?  Honest question.  I can't think of any reason for a person to bash a free marketplace.  Do you work for eBay or something?  
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:19:15
I just created my page ( c347e0fe81d191b03cff4b3dc9f75929746d7992) and what I'm offering is only .04BTC but it did cost me over $5 in materials and countless hours of my time.  I guess I'm just willing to trust people at this point.  Let's see how well the arbitration develops.
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:40:53

In your system I've paid thousands of dollars and still had the info leaked anyway.  Even without the spectre of leaks, that level of anonymity is not worth the price for most people.  Bitcoin properly used, or Monero, or ZCash, or some future crypto, puts a level of transactional anonymity in the hands of the GP basically for free.

He took his time to help the guy out and the question naturally arose.  He didn't guide the conversation to try to be able to plug something.  Was a perfectly reasonable answer.

Only time will tell.  We do know there are no fees, save for the ~1% fee to use the optional moderation.  So theoretically it's a more profitable platform for vendors and/or cheaper for consumers.

I routinely get 20-25%.  The more the item(s) cost, the less aggressive you can be with the discount - there's less people with gift cards with enough value to buy your item(s).

Nope, wrong. Sorry, Barry, thanks for playing.  If we didn't have an income tax you wouldn't need a "mechanism for tax enforcement" and crypto-currencies wouldn't be a threat to your income/power.  Fees would simply be collected at point of sale for goods and services.

@_date: 2016-04-05 16:06:16

Worth what?  It costs absolutely $0 to use OB.  If you get 1 sale it's been "worth it".  The beauty is there's no risk, no barrier to entry.  Nobody is saying vendors are going to be removing their eBay and Amazon listings anytime soon.  But it costs nothing to add your products to OB.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
@_date: 2016-04-03 00:29:57
Yea but I think there's an expectation that they wont create UNLIMITED funds.  Also, it matters in the context of OPs question whether everyone KNOWS you have unlimited funds, or just that person knows - huge difference.  Also, the even better question would be "What's the cheapest way to create a huge crash in the price of bitcoin?"  It's probably not as expensive as people think.

I do love me some AA, and I do have optimism about Bitcoin, and I think the halving will go just fine, but to play devil's advocate: AA mentions a couple times that a lot of miners prepay their electricity so there's less chance of them deciding to not mine at halving.  But, they could've prepaid electricity ONLY UP TO or around the expected date of the halving and take a monthly-pay-wait-and-see approach at halving time.  Just sayin' it's something to think about.

If he had said he supports both fiat and BTC you'd be right.   What he is saying is more akin to supporting both Hilary and Bernie.

And, yet, not nearly as frustrating and slow as the author.

He sold firecrackers to farmers.  Of course, he wasn't the only one doing this, just the only one who went to jail.  He did 10 months in fed prison.

From practice.  I'm sure Visa has the capability to handle this type of transaction but most dealerships set a limit on CCs for reasons that are obvious.

Is this where you tell me about the faster horses people would've wanted instead of cars?  Were just going to end up arguing about the definition of democracy so lets just both agree that we like the system.  You can describe it as a meritocracy or hegemony or whatever you want but to me its more of a democracy.

Thanks for heads up... I assumed there was some shadiness going on I just needed to hear it to keep me from jumping in.  I cant find their fine print anywhere.

I think it's theoretically possible given that other revenue sources would be available.  Also if it was peer to peer only then theres no house, no risk.

Please tell me you just forgot the /s

Misleading... You win a Litecoin, not a Bitcoin :/

And yet they are described as an "upstart".

Kinda like the never-ending cycle of making the blocks bigger?

No, they'll just see it on every checkout screen.  Eyeballs, son.

So I can sell anything I want for no fee while accepting a currency that has been the top performer 4 of the last 5 years?!?! Mind blown.
@_date: 2016-02-13 17:30:07
Do you know of another global marketplace with no fees that accepts Bitcoin? Please tell.
@_date: 2016-02-12 21:17:53
Can't wait to sell my products on here.  What's OB's cut?  Any tools yet for delivering digital goods like ebooks?
@_date: 2016-02-13 05:06:37
Or, like, 10 million 1 satoshi txs.
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:17:52
Ask her if it's the size of your block that matters, or what you do with it?
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:09:59
Isn't it possible he did listen, but still came to his own conclusions? Isn't that allowed?
@_date: 2016-02-27 14:22:33

I heard hes gonna jack the price up to ~3mil BTC and sell it to Satoshi.

Nothing created 6 years ago will be considered a store of value, to say nothing of Mt Gox and the fact that many have had their coins stolen or simply made unavailable. Having said that, I fully expect to be able to do so.

Better headline: "Bitcoin" High on DOPE?"

90% this, but 9% is it's almost complete lack of friction and fees.  The other 1% is moxy!

The fact that you have free access to a marketplace with traffic.  I have a website too, of course (those arent free, btw), but this is another place I can list my item and get exposure.  It's like having a free kiosk in a mall vs selling out of your house or a remote storefront.  Do you think people put items on amazon and ebay just because they cant make websites?
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:41:41
If you look again it shows that the fee is paid by the merchant not the customer (not directly anyway).  If you've found a way, as a merchant, to avoid paying fees for transactions PLEASE do tell.
@_date: 2016-02-10 03:51:19
Yea it was just for effect.  I love Steam and this IS a big deal.  Can't wait to be playing my Steam-powered HTC Vive and make an in-game payment via btc.  Virtual money for virtual reality.

Actually everyone using fiat credit cards pays for these fraudulent transactions every day in the form of higher prices.
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:52:56
I agree with your sentiment but I don't think "the State" will have control over the HyperLedger Project.  Possibly a non-profit akin to ICAAN would be the trusted central party.  Still don't like that as much as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-19 02:32:58
I TRUST you can see you were wrong in this case.
