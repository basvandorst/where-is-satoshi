So now he is back in Florida. The heat is on so time to look busy. Now he wants help with accounting, after a journalist finally called him out. What happened to all of the money over the past few years? 
Looks like he has a long history of scamming people. Why are we surprised?

Link bait blog looks like it's full of hard facts.. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:06:05
Incorrect.. These questions have been asked before with no answer. Bravo Ben!

Was the flight paid for with Bitcoin donations? Was the flight personal business or outpost related. If your charity had correct records and auditing, these questions would be answered.
As of now I consider your flight paid for with the homeless's lunch money.

This shows his true character.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:44:58
Well.. I'm kinda butt hurt since the money was to feed the homeless.. So yeah..

I feel Sean's outpost should be removed due to recent events.

Let's say $100,000 was donated. What if $50,000 was used for the homeless and $50,000 used for Jason's personal use. Are we ok with that? I am not..
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:07:16
This will not be addressed, since the "run" was a lie.
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:14:45
Sean's outpost is questionable.
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:32:22
Yeah, the whole run thing bugs me the most. Wrap a bus with an advert and publicize a run across America, then lie to us. The site was never updated after it started.  Didn't this guy adopt a shiba inu for publicity as well??

Everything asked of Sean's outpost has been asked many times over the past few years. These questions have been ignored by Sean's outpost. I believe the entire dialog has been more respectful than this charity deserves. Kudos Ben for asking the questions, and getting a response.
We have donated over the years to feed the homeless. Where has this money gone? Why not show us? 
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:31:02
This is not link bate or sensational. These questions have been asked of you many times. Each time you have ignored the questions. Your org smells fishy and thankfully Ben has come forward to address the issues and ask the questions that we as a community have not been able to get answered.

Did he? The blog was never updated after Florida. This dude doesn't look like he ran much. Prob drove a lot of it.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:06:18
Fuck you tower of one. I'm sick of hearing your bitching. We want accountability for our donations. No transparency, no donations from me.
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:00:49
I was always suspicious about this "run across America" The web site was hardly updated after the beginning of the run. Are we sure this scammer ran across the country?? Site seems down now 
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:16:27
Sean's outpost.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:10:16
I believe it started.. He drove or rode part and flew into San Fran. Most Feel the same.
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:58:03
Many of us believe the "run across America" was a sham. Can you address this?
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:59:59
I would. I'm sick of this scam artist.
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:19:40
I thought the same thing.. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:08:57
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:49:48
"Basically the same thing that happened last time" correct. Same lack of transparency since this charity formed.
