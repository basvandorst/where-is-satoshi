Not sure if I understand this correctly. So I need to lock up a greater amount of bitcoin for a longer time, in order to use it on the LN?
What if I just want to buy 1 cup of coffee in a shop where I usually don't come? I don't want to have more funds locked up than necessary and I don't want to pay fees twice (for the opening and closing of the channel). Doesn't this method only work if you have A LOT of transactions with a specific party?

I don't mind people jumping into Bitcoin for the price action, but please read up on Bitcoin, look up some Antonopoulos videos on YouTube and understand what this is ACTUALLY about. This is about so much more than the price.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:45:54
I see, thank you for your answer. This clears up things. But doesn't it require A LOT of participants in the LN in order to ensure that there is a link between you, the random person and the shop? Because that doesn't seem like a certainty.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:34:07
Bitcoin is better with lots of participation, but it's not NECESSARY. Look at all the shitcoins that exist without lots of participation.

Cool! I don't think that's a fair comparison, though. Because Starblocks was the famous 'test your lightning network here' app. Nearly everyone showcasing the LN used Starblocks as an example. So the chances of being connected to that will be very high. Especially at this stage, where there are not a lot of virtual services to test your LN.
Not saying that it's an invalid argument, but just that I'm imagining that a real-life coffeeshop will not have the same 'fame' as Starblocks.

There are very few people who have done more for the bitcoin community and the bitcoin cause than this fellow over here. If you don't know that, you must be new to the space.
It's quite funny that you think your opinion outweighs all those people who have donated so much to him, because they felt like he explained bitcoin in such an inspiring way, that they got into crypto, because of him. But yeah, surely he is overhyped just because you personally don't like/connect with his style, right?

What if I told you that a basic income would decrease government spending? Giving a person basic life needs (food, roof, maybe some clothes) saves money on crime and health cost, improves education level and productivity to society.
The question is: Are some people poor because they are unproductive to society or are they unproductive because they are poor? A lot of research needs to be done to know this.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:43
I'm not advising anything, sorry if it looked that way. I was just stating that I was looking at the same situation (paying rent) exactly the opposite way as OP, who got bitcoin and uses it to pay rent in advance, while I try to postpone paying rent as much as possible because of the (possible) returns.

I have my BTC on a Nano S. I memorized the 24 word phrase. I've also distributed parts of the seed phrase on 3 separate locations of close relatives and friends (written on a folded piece of paper that has been laminated). I've given them enough words each, that I can always retrieve the entire phrase with 2 out of 3 papers, just in case 1 of them loses it.

Lol. It's so funny that you accuse me of having feelings on the matter, when I literally said that we need more research on this. You must be really empathic to know what my feelings are over a small piece of text over the internet. Stop making assumptions, those also don't really apply.
That being said. The welfare state is actually something that, in my opinion, works counterproductive, because it discourages working. You will lose the welfare when you get a job, so you are basically working for the difference. With a basic income (or, as some call it, negative income tax), that's not the case. You get a minimum amount of money for basic living and if you work, you get to spend it on a car, nicer clothes, internet and a mobile phone. So there is no inhibition as is with the welfare state.
And if you want proof for the savings on crime and health cost and improvements in education, look up the 'mincome experiment' in Canada. 
This is actually an idea that was proposed by the right in the past, because it causes a smaller government (you need a lot less bureaucrats if you just give everyone a basic income, rather than have a selection for all the welfare programmes for each person that applies).
Feel free to comment on my feelings though, they make for very good arguments.

That's funny. I'm like the exact opposite. I've been putting off paying rent as long as possible so that I could hold bitcoin a bit longer. Because I did, I was able to pay rent for 2 months with the same amount of starting money I would have paid 1 month with if I paid on time. (Didn't actually pay off 2 months, but cashed out half of the amount to pay that month's rent and holding the other half)

Looking at the first transaction: Not sure if I'm getting this right, but it looks like one of the inputs still needs to be confirmed. I think that this transaction can't happen until all inputs are confirmed. That input has a transaction fee of 20 sat/B.
The second transaction has all inputs confirmed, but the transaction itself has a fee of 50 sat/B.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:14
Can we stop with this please? The dump happened because the entire crypto space was overextended, so a correction was bound to happen. You can't have a price increase of 150% within a month, without cooling down after that.
I don't care about bcash and you shouldn't either. It's a crap coin with no long-term strategy. Let's focus on making bitcoin better, rather than blaming every dip on a consipracy from Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. This is getting ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:50:03
Relax. I've had this happen to me as well. I've had a conversation with their support. They wanted me to verify their account.
Just verify your acount with:
- A copy of your ID
- A picture of you holding your ID with a note that says "Bittrex &lt;Today's date&gt;"
- Proof of residence.
 
When I did this, I had my account activated. Since then I've moved my BTC and ETH from that account and never used it since.

His rage and condescending attitude don't really bother me. What does bother me, is that he thinks he has more say in how a supposedly DECENTRALIZED currency is called than other people. I still have bcash (so I'm part of the community) and i call it bcash, because it's a better name. Why does Roger think that he has more say in picking a name than me? If he does, than he automatically admits that it's not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:03:06
I don't have this problem. I always input custom fees in my ledger nano, but it's clear that at least some wallets/exchanges are heavily overpaying in fees, which can cause other wallets/exchanges to compete for getting their transactions in the next block and also charge high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:19:38
I like you too, and your idea of calling anonymous (honourable) people Satoshi. I will make this reference from now on. If any of my non-bitcoin initiated friends asks what a 'Satoshi' is, I will tell them that it's a Japanese word for an honourable person who wishes to remain anonymous and not take credit for his/her good deed. They will believe me. (I have dumb friends)

Pro tip: I have parts of my pass phrase stored with trusted people that don't know each other. I have it stored at 3 places and I have given each person a specific piece of the pass phrase, so that I can retrieve my pass phrase with 2 out of those 3 pieces. If I lose my pass phrase, I can always retrieve it from those people even if 1 of them lost his/her piece or if 1 of them decides not to cooperate. These people don't know that they hold only a piece of the pass phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:10:31
I'll upvote for visibility, but you should really refrain from accusations of theft, unless you have undeniable proof that it isn't just the the amount of work they can't handle right now or that it's an error with their system. I understand that you're emotional about this, but theft is a pretty serious crime to accuse someone of.

The price of electricity will not impact bitcoin. If the price becomes higher, some miners will drop out as it might not be profitable.

I think hes talking about the metric of 'Market cap', which is flawed if not the entire supply of coins is available to the market.
Thought experiment: Let's say I create a coin with a cap of 10^15 coins. I keep all of them to myself, but only sell 100 of those coins. If I can sell 1 of them for 1/10 of a cent, does that mean that my coin has a market cap of 10^15 * 0.001 = $1 trillion?
I don't think so, which is (in a less extreme case) what a lot of these altcoins do, which is why market cap is bogus, which is why measuring dominance based on market cap is even more bogus.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:47:10

While I think you are partially right, I've always found blaming 'the system' a very easy and lazy excuse. Rather I'd like to think that it's human nature that's flawed and will try to find a way to abuse any system. Bitcoin is indeed a better system that attempts to decrease the effects of these human flaws, but if you think people won't find a way to abuse it, you'll be in for a surprise. Still a better system, I agree.

Here's what's changed: What is better? Having 1 BTC or having 2 BTC?
The answer is obvious, but as we are entering a bear market (possibly for a long period of time), I'd rather sell my 1 BTC now and buy 2 BTC with that money later. Or at least, that's the logic of a lot of people. I'm HODLing obviously. ^^Or ^^am ^^I?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:17:40
There is not enough money pouring into bitcoin right now. 
- New people (who don't really understand bitcoin) are getting burnt hard, so they'll say 'Ah, so it is a bubble' and they will sell.
- Hodlers already have their money in BTC, so they can't drive the price up.
- Institutional players know a bear market when they see one, so they are not touching this thing with a 10 ft. pole until it shows some clear signs of recovery.
To drive the price up, there needs to be more demand than supply and quite frankly, it's not here right now. Even the most bullish people are turning bearish right now and are selling off. Not because they don't believe in bitcoin anymore, but they can get more bitcoin if they sell now and buy when (they think) it bottoms.
This is a bear market. You don't get 70% slow correction and not call it a bear market. The last (real) bear market took 3 years to recover. I don't think it will take that long this time around, but I'm finding a year really plausible.

Bitcoins will remain to be mined for another 100 years, son. The last satoshi will be mined in (approx.) 2141.
Not only that, but transactions have a fee, so that will be the reward for mining.
