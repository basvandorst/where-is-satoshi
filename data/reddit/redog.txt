@_date: 2014-12-07 12:44:23
My point being there is no exposed port since it's behind the NAT. As I understand TV works by connecting from the client through the teamviewers servers. So the hacker gained knowledge of the TV account by means other than port scanning. I suspect a keylogger on another PC.

Bingo, I couldn't agree more.

In gentoo minimalism rules. defaults have always been modest and not gutted. USE flag defaults should leave most packages in their default states i.e. ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
Adding functionality is encouraged through the use of USE flags USE="addsomecoolshit"
i.e. ./configure --with-addsomecoolshit &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
Downstream patches should only be accepted if they're security related and those usually make their way back up stream and get dropped from ebuilds.

I've used gentoo since 1.2a and typically non upstream patches have been for security purposes only. Gentoo is NOT a consumer distro. I don't want gentoo developers/maintainers baking in defaults just because they like them and have used them for years. Make it a use flag then let the community demand it to become default. I use gentoo to limit, test and iterate not to complicate, politicize and alienate.

If and when the power shift happens the judicial system may not have much say in these tactics because they won't be as easily employable by prosecutors.  Then prosecutors might actually have to do real work.

Same error. There's some sort of image protection function that's breaking after the camera takes it's photo and the app just gives up on the photo.

Do you actually believe that is how the law works? 
- Semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit. — The burden of proof always lies upon the claimant
- Non possessori incumbit necessitas probandi possessiones ad se pertinere. — It is not incumbent on the possessor of property to prove that his possessions belong to him.
- Affirmanti, non neganti incumbit probatio. — The burden of proof is on the party who affirms, not upon one who denies.
- Facultas probationum non est angustanda. — The right of offering proof is not to be narrowed.
- In criminalibus, probationes debent esse luce clariores. — In criminal cases, the proofs ought to be clearer than light.
- Quod per recordum probatum, non debet esse negatum. — That which is proved by record ought not to be denied.
- Quod constat curiae opere testium non indiget. — That which is clear to the court needs not the help of witnesses
- Probandi necessitas incumbit illi qui agit. — The necessity of proving lies with the person who sues
- Principia probant, non probantur. — Principles prove, they are not proved.
- Praesumptiones sunt conjecturae ex signo verisimili ad probandum assumptae. — Presumptions are conjectures from probable proof, assumed for purposes of proof
- Idem est non probari et non esse: non deficit jus, sedprobatio. — What is not proved, and what is not, are the same; it is not a defect of the law, but a want of proof.
- Factum negantis nulla probatio sit. — No proof is required of him who denies a fact
- Semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit. — The claimant is always bound to prove; the burden of proof lies on the actor.
- Ei incumbit probatio, qui dicit, non qui negat; cum per rerum naturam factum negantis probatio nulla sit. — The burden of proof lies upon him who asserts it, not upon him who denies, since, by the nature of things, he who denies a fact cannot produce any proof of it

Well that's stretching it. I first noticed LJr because of the Gentoo bitcoind drama. As a longtime gentoo user/contributor it left me with a bitter taste for the person behind the words because his rhetoric seemed to be diametrically opposed to the philosophy of gentoo (i.e. user choice(especially when it comes to configuration choices)) and instead of listening to suggestion by other contributors he took a very staunch position of authority or at least  I know better than you. I was quickly amazed that someone with that attitude was a bitcoin developer. It certainly made me wonder how code contributions to bitcoin were treated. 
I've looked on in awe ever since.  He just doesn't _seem_ like a free software developer. Not in attitude nor in rhetoric.  I'm glad he's contributing but holy shit what a circus his style seems to have caused. I don't really have an opinion on the guy other than that and it's no wonder the scaling "debate" has drug on for so long. I often wonder if his more outrageous comments aren't bait for his haters but I also worry that maybe I'm giving a crazy person too much credit. I still don't think he's a Judas. To me it looks like he's socially empowered and having a grand time with it. I think some of his haters are just missing details.

Always been like that, people choose to compete instead of cooperate. 
 


the traders used an even more uncooperative strategy than the psychopaths,
maximizing their relative gain only by harming the game partner. This result
seems to corroborate the popular notion of ruthlessness on behalf of the traders,
but is surprising in view of the fact that traders are supposed to maximize the
total gain for their businesses


the relative gain, the traders seem to be motivated more by competition than by
lucrative pragmatism. This irrational relative thinking is also observed in other areas of economic psychology such as consumer behavior.[1]

No, LN is another layer. To use it you and a partner ""open a channel" by each risking some btc. The total of the "channel" i.e. at risk crypto, is the limit of how much can be transacted through said "channel". 
If one side tries to "cheat" the LN penalizes them by giving the whole channels funds to the channel partner.

I've been saying for quite some time now that I think CSW "hacked satoshi just enough" to know who it was and then when he died knew there would be no way for anyone to call his bluff. The rest of the details are typical political maneuvering. CSW tried to establish a back history with bullshit companies created in his and Dave's name. Likely without Dave even being a real party(hacked info used for identity theft.)

I gotta say, even if it's been revised some, I can't quite shake that feeling either.


I don't know, it's gripping for sure and I love a good reveal but unless CSW ever actually moves or signs with the satoshi keys I think this one is going to go into the unsolved mystery books.
I've not gotten further away from my own theory which is that DK was the sole individual behind satoshi and his anonymity was not complete or was compromised in such a way that CSW was able to assert these falsehoods knowing there wasn't anyone to left to counter the claims. 
The satoshi coins are locked in the drive that Dave's brother has (CSW has interestingly referenced this drive a few times).

@_date: 2018-03-29 21:56:07


Well yea, I know that, It's called virtue signaling and It's done here too. The word Bcash is a perfect counter example. I've been mostly petrified to comment here for a few years now. The ONLY reason I ever subscribed there was because of the ALLEGED heavy handed ban hammering here. I know you all (mods on both subs) don't deserve ALL of the criticism given but it became obvious to me (because of my own research / and maybe libertarian biases) that a lot of it was. So I'm not sure if I'd be considered a "there account" or a "here account" but I ain't scared to write out my off the cuff opinions there, whereas here I usually just read and keep the hype or fud to myself.


Why? Any opinion however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth. I find It's pretentious when people think they need to curate content for me. For me the deontological considerations concerning censorship and intellectual freedom take precedence over consequentialist arguments. 
It usually happens when people think their opinion on a matter is infallible. Silencing of discussion is an assumption of that infallibility. Even if the opinion some wish to censor is largely false, it may contain some portion of truth, a portion denied us if we suppress the speech which contains it. 
I'm a free-software zealot and find it ironically laughable how politicized the word fork is in crypto conversations. It's a "four letter word" around here. Yet in the free software world it's celebrated and enshrined.
Censorship is wrong because it makes it less likely that truth will be discovered or preserved, and it is wrong because it has destructive consequences for the intellectual character of those who live under it.

Yes, that's the original post, to which I replied.


Yes, it did indeed seem to support the implication that was pursuing. I don't deny that similarity. 
If was attempting to dispel that, which I'm certain he was, then I think he fell short by describing the difference in the manner he did, i.e. four **whole** years. 
I simply wanted to point out for those who may not be aware that four-whole-Hal-has-ALS-years aren't equivalent to four-whole-Hal-before-ALS-years because I only recently learned that Hal died of ALS and if someone was hiding their online activity then contracts ALS they're certainly going to do so much differently going forward. Maybe even disappearing due to the difficult nature of their ALS life.

I'm not disagreeing here but this was the same argument made against BCH pre-fork. Obviously miners are mining BCH so it's wrong.
It's obvious to me too that the introduction of the third chain will change the nature of the profit oscillation between the 2 current chains but I think all three will have increasing hash power over time.

No, you're correct. I also don't consider Gentoo extremist nor Libertarianism in particular but I understand that I'm in the minority in those regards when it comes to perspective. I'm old enough to know that  my perspective is rarely a shared one.
The point is that when it comes to a majority of a particular view that view holds other's perspective as an extreme to their own. This is the case between much political dispute, the stipulation alone isn't enough to frame the perspective. You must subscribe to definitions that differ from your own just to begin looking at it. 
The small blockers certainly view the simple large block solution as problematic. So from their perspective, yes it's extreme, that's what they mostly say. I've seen articulate arguments for minimizing the size as well. From my perspective that's extreme. See how it works?

I'm a software zealot. Redhat is the industry leader yet I use gentoo for my personal and professional solutions. I see crypto in much the same way. BTC is the industry leader. It inspires competition but keeps it's cards close to it's chest and remains much safer than other options. BCH looks more like a Gentoo or Arch. Something that knows the fundamentals yet chooses to run on extreme principles because users are asking for such things.
In the world of software we tend to use solutions that answer user concerns. But being concerned with what another is concerned over and then dismissing their concerns is rather ridiculous. I think you should just accept that some of us are more into that one than the alternatives. For many It's really that simple for other's it's a fucking identity crisis because of their reliance on identity politics to navigate life.

I'm not making any claims on what should or shouldn't be done. 
Segwit looks just ok to me...
I was simply pointing out that if there's room for lesser-than-bitcoin coins to flourish then something attempting to remain as close to bitcoin purism as BCC purports should have a chance at actually being relevant if not overtaking and redefining Bitcoin. 
I see no reason to condone or condemn SW but if the block size increase is not carried out then I have a very reasonable claim to distrust those who agree to a compromise only to renege. It seems to me that BCC is a reasonable threat. Maybe they're overreacting but given the shenanigans and the value at risk I don't blame them for playing such a hand.
Personally I kind of hope they renege on the block increase just so I can see it play out and confirm my uncertain beliefs.

I think it's happening Aug 1. Whether or not it actually persists depends upon lots of things, the biggest one being the 2MB size increase. 
Currently I think we get the increase and BCC dies as it fails to out perform segwit +2MB
I do think the politics surrounding the blocksize debate is making it more possible that the signatories of the NYA cancel the 2MB increase out of spite or the knowledge that there will already be another chain with bigger blocks. I just think they'll lose more trust than it's worth if that happens and that the ultimate winner will be born out of performance.

Then you do prefer myspace? Because when I ask it's because Myspace was at one point on top and now isn't and some may even prefer it that way. I know I preferred reddit when digg was on top. And maybe you want to revisit the OP topic because the entire fucking thread is about OP's fear of BTC falling to 'number2'


No, You might be. To suggest my question had to do with myspace's development is some good spin there. I was quipping about a potential fall from grace. I.E. Like myspace did. Like digg did. Like slashdot did! Like Yahoo messanger did, like ICQ did like AOL. Not HOW they did it.


And RIGHT THERE I wasn't even trying to give examples of that you idiot. I was filling in the context between "You're just insulting me because I failed to steer your attention towards what I MEANT away from WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING I MEANT, when I first appealed with, "but I have been thinking about this stuff..." 
Why would I even need to give a fucking example of why someone would choose ETH over BTC to make this point? 
Bitcoin may remain the cryptocurrency standard for eternity but I think the possibility for another crypto to take over the role is very possible and for you to digg in your heals over whether or not I made a 'Puritan' metaphor between the fate of bitcoin and that of myspace's fall from grace shows me that you're more interested in splitting hairs over how enlightened or numbskulled I am than you are of the OP which is about a potential "fall from the top" 


Nope I've been making the same lazyily styled metaphors since at least when digg failed but I'm glad you're so in tuned to what goes on in my mind. Its not like it takes a fucking savant to take note of similarities but we all have different perceptions.

1. money in coins or notes, as distinct from checks, money orders, or credit.

I was just tying the analogy together. You asked if bitcoin could power your house. then asked if a pile of dollars could. Your retort was that you never suggested dollars were backed by electricity.

So what's an example of any currency redeemable by a non volatile priced commodity?
Even Gold prices fluctuate right? 
It seems to me the only difference is knowing some more of the terms of the transaction prior to attempting the transaction. And only if price remained constant. 


Ok so if Bitcoin is irredeemable then it seems dishonest to even call it a currency, virtual or otherwise. More like what? An intangible fractional monetary good?

I watched the 260 to 65 crash and bought in at 80.
I watched the 1100 rise and got eager and sold at 350 then bought back in at 665 but held. I have bought at 995 and 698 and now at 571. Basically, I've got as much as I'm willing to lose in it and still even in value even though I caught one low buy and high sell. Now, I'm holding long. Probably will set a date based off my kids graduation though I may buy in again later depending upon finances I'm willing to forego.

I suppose the WATTS &lt;=&gt; ฿ cycle isn't exactly circular but it is as you say entirely different. I think it's therefore reasonable to say it's backing would also be a little different. 
If the reason for a currency backing in the first place is to 1, nullify inflation and 2, provide an [Asset-backed security]( then I find electricity **seems like** that asset. Does it do either of those? I dunno and maybe not. But there is no other commodity I know of that is even close.

But Crypto isn't a commodity. Can a cryptographer run bitcoin without the network? Can the network run without electricity? In the strictest sense here I mean backing as in the traditional definition of [Currency Backing.](
As long as we can produce electricity sufficient to run the crypto and continue building upon the network bitcoin is (at least to my mind) sufficiently as good as gold.
Otherwise I agree with everything else you've stated.

I feel like such an ironic-oldtimer on this one. I remember reading about bitcoin  in late 2010 and thinking, "A digital currency? Nice! I should build a cluster out of all this crap inventory and help mine some!" While I did consider it, I quickly learned that my vision was shortsighted and even though I started a miner I never did get it working correctly or at least never got any coin much less get them to work in concert. 
Now, with all the news of it lately, I can't help but feel like I've missed another of life's opportunities. Yet I still can't seem to convince myself to buy any...why spend money on it when I couldn't even contribute what I really wanted?
Ironic since my career has been helping people learn to use new technology and here I am at 0 BTC.

Sure you can, they call their credits Watts, we call ours dollars or bitcoin or EUR or CNY. We exchange them first sometimes because not every company accepts the EUR for WATTS. 


I get what you're saying and I suppose the WATTS &lt;=&gt; ฿ cycle isn't exactly circular but Bitcoin is a bit different than what we traditionally call currency. I think it's therefore reasonable to say it's backing would also be a little different. 
If the reason for a currency backing in the first place is to 1, nullify inflation and 2, provide an [Asset-backed security]( then I find electricity **seems like** that asset. Does it do either of those? I dunno and maybe not. But there is no other commodity I know of that is even close.
Ensuring that affordable and reliable electric service is available is at the core of the energy industry and Electricity is fungible isn't it? 


The only restriction on variance is the actual credit to be redeemed. I can't use the actual computer as a backing. I cannot use the "network" as a backing. Neither of those are even fungible. I believe electricity is though, albeit some companies are more efficient than others at providing it so without a perfectly sound energy efficient method of producing and providing it the price of it is likely to vary on many factors. That doesn't mean the commodity isn't the backing, just that said backing isn't sound enough to prevent inflation/deflation alone. Maybe bitcoins' features address this maybe not.
I'm probably guilty of shoehorning it a bit here so I apologize for any egregious errors. I'm no economist and I'm not even convinced bitcoin will remain successful. Though it seems to me to have found a sweet spot for what could become a very sound currency system. Maybe the question will instead become, Debit, Credit or Bitcoin? I dunno, but if the cost of electricity goes through the roof I think bitcoin value would be affected. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:01:05
Well, it's certainly not fiat but it's [backed]( none the less. The network that mines and verifies is required for it. That network is powered by computers that require electricity. The commodity is electricity, or perhaps we could go a little further and say it's what creates the electricity but I think that's beside the point since we can harness electricity through many sources. I suppose we could pay cryptographers to do it by hand but then we're back to trusting someone like fiat requires.
