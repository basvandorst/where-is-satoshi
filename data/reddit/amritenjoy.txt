there will be 26% dilution every year (26% of total ether sold in pre sale) but you should also consider the face that any ethers you pay as fee (fuel) to write contracts will be taken out of the system. so in short 26% of X, added every year minus Y. (X is total ether sold in presale + 20% for dev team etc., Y is ethers used in writing contracts and using Ethereum Platform. X will constant every year but Y will be a variable. So price will vary.

I agree ETF rejection will take it below 1000$ for short period of time but it will regain again as it did with chianies mining companies issue.
But worse would be when if community is unable to settle block size debate. If that goes longer and longer or there are 2 Blockchains then expect a long term below 1k$ mark. Lightening network or seg wit has to be implemented for btc to keep its march.

What is so special in 2018 that it will rise to 30k+ level. I honestly believe that btc will continue moving up but not as much as you say. I think 5k+ is fair by the end of 2018. It would go more if euro zone breaks and currency chaos follows. Then Europe may not have much choice. China is expected to solidify its currency and finance. Some regulatory framework will be developed in next 18 months . That will help too. But I think 5k -8k would be a fair assessment provided the $ value remains as stable as today. If there is problem with $ then it is not Bitcoin rise, then it would be $ fall. In that case precious metals will be worth more because of its history and human belief system build around it, although I think btc is better than gold.

Unlimited still has the no oF nodes they had, that has not fallen. Check last 1000 blocks mined that is significant for unlimited.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:28:53
Rosie - coinbase is not responding to emails both at support and support + Reddit. 
Still missing my btc. 
Coinbase mum. 6 days and counting.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:10:45
What has Happened that bU is over. Anyway I never linked roger and his circus, but still needs to know, he has 800+ nodes running on unlimited?
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:06:37
To do 2 Mb size just like that would require hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:45:13
What happens to bitcoins on paper wallets in case of fork happening ?
Will they get both coins without some kind of wallet upgrading ?
How to separate those coins ?
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:18:12
I never linked unlimited at the first place but I made a Wrong discussion after btc went below 900, I exchanged it with eth when eth was 51. Now btc is up and eth is down. Second I removed my btc from circle which is very good service as compared to coinbase. Kraken is not insured which is quite a risk keeping coins in there wallet. 
I never trusted roger and his circus. But 11% was what he had when discussing what at its peak. So nothing changed since then. What is celebration about ?
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:27:26
What is the shock ?
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:28:55
That depends - no fork scaling happens by seg-wit or other method of soft fork. Prise above 1500.
Fork happens - price between 500-600. Altcoins will rise. It will take long for btc to recover and one of split chain has to be killed. Unlikely scenario.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:38:43
How? Any link ? I just checked the node count unlimited has what they had ?
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:12:53
Bcos he is a clown too
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:10:43
Still nothing from Coinbase. have not responded to my emails
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:06:31
Just trying to find out how many zeroes are in a brazillion? Anyone knows
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:48:55
Thanks - what it takes for a fork to happen, is it  51% nodes or 51% of mining power? 
 only 500 nodes running BTU and BTC has more than 5400, it is not even near, it seems long road for fork if that is to happen, what do u think.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:43:21
Did you finally get your money back?
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:08:12
I don't think roger ver has best interest at heart for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:32:50
Let's assume Bitcoin scales without splitting by some consensus then sky will be the lower limit for price. 
Think of mumble wumble-rootstack - lightening network etc. in that case you will regret your decision exiting. I'm in it since 2013 and has always bought and never sold.
Although my intreast has grown in other coins
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:51:34
I never received second email to approve.....
2 emails came at the same time at different address but nothing after that....
So still waiting 
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:01:09
Is it 51% nodes or 51% mining power? Where can I check mining power or node count ?
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:14:41
Agreed. If other currency like crypto coins take root it will hurt Bitcoin price in the short, long and medium run.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:25:50
What did the market speak a week ago?
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:28:26
Exiting Bitcoin what did you go in.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:29:33
I am not sure the person handling the case understands what the problem is. he is still saying that i have to confirm from my primary and sec emails which was done on march 1. i did it again today and the message was "this task has already been completed"
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:26:12
Email Conf message was complied to. Transaction still not complete. Out of vault but not in the reg wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:41:03
In case of fork, the bitcoins on paper wallet , r they safe ? Will the holder in that case will have both coins, core and unlimited?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:25:44
It is 6 days and counting . That is not customer fault if they r busy.
What if someone needs his/her btc. This could be another my gox in making. It is also about honesty. 
They are not responding to emails now...
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:45:42
3 months ?
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:16:55
Why no impact? Bitcoin was to eat their lunch 'remittances' etc. they just saved it. 
Also more banks will follow suit with their respective coins?
@_date: 2015-07-02 04:52:59
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:59:53
If it survives that long, then that could happen.

Segwit is not changing blocksize it is twisting data to  adjust more data through the given blocksize (1mb in btc). Sigwit is a side chain talking to main Blockchain. It will create an extended block and take some data out of transaction into extended block to lower the size of the data so that more data can be accommodated through the block. 
In case of btc it gives 75% more room. This is not a perm fix to Block size but lightening network can help have millions of transactions per second. Lightening network needs segwit.
I cannot be more simple than this.
Segwit does not do anything to Blockchain itself.
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:30:47
Already their are multiple Bitcoins that r lost. Lost wallets etc. 
in our life time it will be 20 million max Bitcoin. Next I million will take 100 years to mine, we all will be long gone. I think There will be atleast 10 million people with 1 or more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:36:31
What is the node count ratio for core vs unlimited?
Coin dance is not working 
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:11:49
But it cannot work with current block size so scaling has to be resolved. To have reasonable level of scaling segwit is needed.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:50:30
Consensus and time
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:11:08
Side chains can help little in terms of scaling but that is not the real intention of side chains it is just a byproduct. They r not designed for that ofcource that happens anyways
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:08:33
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:17:41
Thanks 
Is there a chart to refer for more than an Year holding?
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:07:34
That stats are last 1000 blocks not 100 blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:23:25
Let me rephrase, for rootstock to implement, scaling has to be resolved with or without segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:09:33
Right, it will increase "capacity" by 75% by trick and has a future plan of increasing the block size slowly. 
This is a tricky situation to increase block size since large increase can open many security issues so it has to be done bit by bit dynamically. Yes LN can help millions of transactions per second. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 10:28:18
After segwit is launched. Rootstock needs segwit to work. When will segwit be launched, it is anybody's guess.
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:17:48
Rootstock is not scaling solution segwit is
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:15:07
Rootstock is a side chain to Bitcoin Blockchain, it will have smart contracts functionality enabled on Bitcoin blockchain just like ethereum. 
For rootstock to function with Bitcoin Blockchain the block size of Bitcoin Blockchain needs to be bigger. Block size of Bitcoin already is full. Segwit is a scaling solution.
I hope it is clear now.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:49:59
That was helpful

The top names in the article are under investigation for fraud and money laundering by Indian fed investigators. Unrelated to crypto, they have been involved in money laundering schemes. I think they think they can hide their black money in crypto.
