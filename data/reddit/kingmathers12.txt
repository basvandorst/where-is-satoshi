There was a hack on the 7th and on the 8th we had a big swing.

You're paranoid

I'm anticipating it will continue through the day maybe 20% at most.  The last hack on the 7th was $70mil and in 24 hrs it dropped 20%

Solid logic
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:58:02
Always seems to work that way doesn't it.

You were saying?

Not worried just looking for opportunities and opinions

We knew it was coming within the month.

If hackers stole 4000 BTC then sold them you don't think that would move the market?  Some news sites are posting this so I'm sure there is some reactionary movement as well.

The federal reserve doesn't print money technically.  They do loan money to the banks but the US Treasury prints money.  And banks also do not lend the money they borrow from the federal...well not all of it.  A bank is required to keep 10% of all deposits as cash on hand.  So essentially it is lending 90% of your money to loan seekers.  When they drop below this 10% they will borrow money from the Fed or another bank.  The Fed typically offers a higher rate than borrowing from another bank. 
On top of that a bank tends to take the money they borrow from the Fed at 0.1% And buy treasuries that pay 3.5%.  So I believe the banks have some leeway in what they offer savings/checking interest rates.  They are just greedy which is why they have not.

I get this but not everyone does or will.  A large portion (more than half) of the adoption will come from casual users who will swap back to fiat in the blink of an eye if they are incentivized.  People's loyalty can be bought.

How would raising checking/savings interest rates crash the economy?  Ally offers a 1% on savings but requires a large balance.  Why couldn't that become the norm for savings or even checking?  I'm legitimately asking bc I'm not an expert at economics.

How does lower savings rates suggest a booming economy?

Printing money is linked to loan rates TO banks from larger world bank's.  A banks checking and savings rates have nothing to do with printing money.  But I do agree with your second point.  However, I'm not talking about raising checking and savings rates to even CD levels.  I'm talking about 1-2%.  If people see that they can keep 10gs in there savings and earn a guaranteed $100 while having liquidity this may incentivize casual crypto users to keep less in bitcoin to avoid risk hindering mass adoption.

Lowering loan interest rates, but im taling about raising savings interest rates.
