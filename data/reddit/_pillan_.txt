@_date: 2018-01-31 03:37:06

@_date: 2018-01-15 03:52:30
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:06:42
9.8k at gdax, if we reach 8k can we say "lets the end begin"?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:42:22
do you remember when only 1 job was needed for have a house, send your child to university, have a car and have a nice retirement?.
but some one say "hey, thinks are to expensive, we are gonna move to china so you can have more things"
and now your mother and father works, and they cant pay university, buy a car using a bank loan and forget about retirement.
yep, things are cheaper, but sadly still was better in the old times.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:03:06
Media: but if bitcoin us used to avoid tax, to finance terrorism, and money laundry, then you will think about banning bitcoin?.
Finance minister: well, maybe
Media: !!!!south korea still banning bitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:51:29

thats bother me :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:54:22
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:44:36
yeah men, tomorrow you could be dead, so whats the deal?.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:32:52
coinbase its like a truck using a road for cycles, and telling that the road is used to travel.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:37:24
interesting that satoshi think that any transaction lower than 0.01 could be considered spam.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:22:22
embrace market manipulation and take the chance to buy more cheap bitcoin, when we reach 100k a lot will complain about not buying enough at 10k.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:29:22
which company?, thats matters.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:58:37
better, more time to buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:34:39
sorry but thats not coinbase money(bitcoin), is users money(bitcoin), and coinbase charge the users for the fee.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:25:13
so segwit support?, bech32?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:37
i hate you.
ps: can you send me some bitcoins? :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:17:55
why not take some profit after reaching 20k?.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:30:27
bitcoin is so good that allow people buy at discount if you dont have money when was cheaper-
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:36

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:35:08
demand segwit in your exchange!!!!
PS: we need a bot that everytime someone ask about fees post about demanding segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:01:57
let those futures get close...
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:14:16
and how do you think that people get rich?, working hard?

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:43
too much moon for my body!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:03:35
when people who create webpages or mined bitcoin become so important?.
the only important here is satoshi, and hi is gone, anyone else can go to hell and nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:08:47
you dont play games with bitcoin, waiting that tatoo.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:24:50
dollar cost average = bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:42:05
already on the road to 15k
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:57:28
people wanting cheap bitcoin is so innocent.
bitcoin value is near to zero, but they forget production cost, you cant sell below production cost.
at the same time have to pay big bills, so you cant keep that bitcoins and affect the market while holding huge amounts.
also you force miners to invest real world object into virtual world, miners harms themselves if they try to damage bitcoin and lose they real world money.
no, changing to aeasy/cheaper way of bitcoin production will affect the price, but that doesnt means that more effective miners can be developed in the future, or push for more green energy.
come on people, 10 years ago iphone doesnt exist, have more faith in technology.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:41:17
never sneeze again!!!
i want that dip!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:48:51
aaaaand its gone.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:09:56
sad day for me, really, wanted more time to buy more cheap bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:56:31
satoshi send his conscience from the future, so when the last bitcoin be minned the year 2140 he reveal himself as the humanity liberator.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:12
a nice green wall at gdax :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:39
down voted and voted negatively.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:50
i never tough that was a millonaire when bitcoin was almost 20k and im not thinking that bitcoin is dead.
patience guys, when people say that bitcoin will turn into a millionaire for free, they are so wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:20:30
so close and so far!!!!
damn you bitcoin, can you dip a little??? :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:42

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:51:09
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:40
thats looks a like 24 late sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:14
when someone talk about bitcoin turning into gold 2.0 and high fees that made impossible to use bitcoin i like to think about this:
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:15:05
im the only happy if bitcoin losses 50%?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:06:06
its just me or 16k looks stable?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:43:02
do you remember this?, 25k by 2022?
times flies
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:52:29
i didnt buy enough at 1.8k, and have lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:07:00
crazy asians.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:04:06
i know that you need to look some bitcoin, how many btc need to be locked?.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:19
bcash is like the b plan for people that dont invest too much in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:32
we celebrate at 20k or 100k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:49
thats a tulip-mazda.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:14:29
venezuela accepting bitcoin for petrol?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:12
follow roger ver and the true bitcoin(?)
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:11:27
buy high 
sell low
you did it
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:40
1M or 500k when some country embrace bitcoin, like venezuela or another petrol-country, not before.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:02
i use my bcash to buy my mom a new ipad.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:41:15
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:06:30
in bitcoin we trust.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:53:31
over 20% IMO, or any lose that need more than 36 hour to recover.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:11:11
do you remember lightning?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:05:55
for people that invest late is like a second chance to live again!!!
dont mind of lose money.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:01:52
if i was bought at march, already could have more than 1 BTC.
but didnt have job so buy in "small" accounts from my saves, after almost 8 mouth still cant reach 1BTC.
if you have money, invest heavy, until you reach some good amount, then you can relax, but buy now!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:38:19
can import bitcoin from non segwit to segwit?, or have to transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:11:25
remember telling my mom that in about 10 years will have a lot of money, now looks like 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:31:54
i you ask me, the real bubble in that graph is apple.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:02:55
dont forget china.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:09:33
for god sake somebody please put some replay protection in that damn thing!!!
sadly dont know enough programming.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:11:16
question: If you get a bitcoin prepaid debit card, and use that card to buy things using your bitcoin, still have to paid taxes?.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:12:37
think about BCASH as the brave who are the first in die in the war.
Really, centralization is the most dangerous foe of any crypto, bitcoin wasnt born to be fast, or to have many features like ethereum.
Bitcoin was designed and born to be hard to kill, sad to alot of people dont see it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:34:36
im scared!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:31:30
exchange, wallets, users.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:08:33
what if he come as another developer?, or mined more bitcoin but using another wallet?.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:39:32
in the long term increase block size is impossible to avoid.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:26:57
anything that lead to centralization isnt bitcoin.
Do you remember?, bitcoin is a decentralized cypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:42:04
when you can choose, choose the things you like and enjoy, dont waste your precious time in things you dislike.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:36:01
no, no and no.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:40
what was trying to say is that satoshi not necessary disappear or is dead, maybe he is among us but using another name.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:04:13
my exchange give my bcash, but have to trade to get the money, didnt know how to do it, sowanna try to do today, sadly went from 1100 to 900 :(
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:27:40
off course, because they wanna blame core devs.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:14:38
just have patience and wait for the futures of CME.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:54:07
as bitcoin is deflationary this isnt a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:23:51
i stay wth bitcoin.
if the bitcoin chain freeze, i will wait, if the price goes to 0.1 cents, dont care, i will wait.
my money and trust is with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:15:44
exchange this useless gold for this modern and easy to use dollar.
who is the idiot your gold fanatical(?)
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:00:36
im going to buy an ipad to my mom this xmas, btc at 10k would be nice :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:02:39
thank to all of us who believe, defend and trust bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:55:44
send some fiat money to my sister, have to pay a lot in transport.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:20:43
surbtc, chilean exchange.
check trade part of the site and find options like bcash/btc or bcash/fiat but dont know best way to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:06:04
why not an ico(?)
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:31:56
deflation is the best thing in the world.
i have more money today than yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:39:13
but thats not your money.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:14:07
im already on the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:43:45
put lots of money(if you have, of course).
when you gain x2 or even x3, take your initial investment and keep the other.
its a win-win situation, then you can invest weekly or monthly.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:39:50
7k already on my exchange :(
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:41:55
135 sat/byte dont look like $15, looks like USD $0.0105155010.
check your glasses or your computer.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:29:14
but any experience with segwit?, really fast and low fees?
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:53:45
i dont care who is bigger!, segwit finally is getting attention, thats what matters.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:28:17
what a magical place to live is zimbabwe, its like living in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:43:14
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:25:08
can we banned this guy?, really, the are like 1000s cryptos and he can choose anyone of them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:25:02
as always now bitcoin is on the decline :(
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:39:24
2k too high.
3k too high.
4k too high.
5k too high.
6k too high.
sad, isnt?, could have your money increase x6 but "still too high".
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:46
is segwit enabled by default?, how can activate?
how can generate a segwit address?
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:48:00
wake me up when quantum computing have practical uses.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:33:55
if you dont spend you are poor.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:00:41
strange how 7k feels like normal bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:53:36
thats why gold is dead.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:09:14
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:55:30
demand segwit people, really.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:35:53
we are talking about money, this is more complicated than religion.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:30:54
next big crash will be when gobs around the world try to kill bitcoin, because they will try, and of course bitcoin will survive.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:33:18
no one owns gold, or silver or the sun.
even satoshi dont own bitcoin, thats why the never use his real name, or never touch his bitcoin.
dont trust anyone, greed is too powerful.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:50:56
how are you gonna kill something that isnt backed for the gob?
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:15:21
any guide about how to do it on electrum,?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:05:06
probably we end today at 8900-9000
patience, 10k will come eventually.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:07:41
why are we talking about roger ver again? /s
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:20:37
what about getting a bitcoin prepaid debit card?, move some money and buy things?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:43:46
money IS a store of value, sadly central banks prints money like stupid, but, one of the things that you need to be considered a money is being a store of value.
So, why the big deal with bitcoin being a store of value?.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:27:30
a money cant be a money if isnt a store of value.
you need to read guys, really.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:11:26
bitcoin was born to fight against monetary politics by the fed and central banks.
and here we are, fighting against individuals that wanna impose they vision about bitcoin.
Bitcoin dont hear miners, dont hear banks, the fed, only the users.
and if that dont like you, fine, you can fork the code and be happy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:37:14
like not allow people tell other how much bitcoin they have?, yes, core devs need to implement that /s
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:15
and this is money, not a web page.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:34:22
the same people who sell at 9k because of the crypto ban on google and facebook are going to buy at 15k.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:22:47
wait for the dow jones tomorrow-
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:56:03
im temped to sell(small amount)
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:10:59
estimate time to reach 17M of btc?
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:42:48
2015-2016 was like this?, like an ice age for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:42:23
this guys sounds like bchash supporters and "big blocks solve the problem".
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:07:57
a lot of people use currency as stock, buy dollar when is high and sell when is low, yes, sounds crazy, both of them.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:22:57
to me binance looks more transparent that a lot of banks, with lots of regulations and you know, real money.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:45:16
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:02:21
finally green numbers in my highly-speculative-non-bitcoin portfolio!!!
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:21:33
sounds good to me.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:26:04
looks like someone turn on the damn sell bot on gdax-
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:17:29
in the road to 11700
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:19:52
or the buyers are too weak.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:05:56
anyone here in myspace?
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:33:37
i know that, but what if i reset the trezor? still risky? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:05:29
bitcoin at 6k was a good moment to buy, at 7.2k also was good to buy.
why you wait for some pump to buy?, you are already late.
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:53:55
and then, after the 3rd buy high and sell low, he come back to live to hold forever
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:25:38
almost 10 years, and still wanting my blockchain app(not bitcoin) that will change the world...
...because the truth is that blockchain never was needed to speed up bank transaction, or allow to track food or clothes. Any thing that someone sell you as revolutionary thanks to block could be made with non blockchain services.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:30:13
so still possible for bitcoin to reach 1M by 2020.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:42:00
i dont know where motorola, or anker offices are, and whats the problem?.
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:09:04
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:30:52
someone please buy those damn sell walls!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:49:21
bitcoin almost x2 in less than 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:32:22
and now we are going down, bitcoin, you are so predictable nowadays
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:57:02
i selling one of my lung for 1 btc, anyone?
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:47:38
we will see 15k sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:21:28
not yet please, cheap bitcoin and still no money :(
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:58:46
you cant beat the market, so better be the market.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:04:14
that why you use bitcoin and not shitty credit cards.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:21:45
then we have to create a new bitcoin, if that fails then another one.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:18:10
shortest pump ever?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:09:37
sad?, are you crazy?, instead of paying 20k for 1 bitcoin, you could get 1 for 4k.

@_date: 2018-03-28 04:37:19
TIL that the value of a coin is determined by the cost of production of that coin. If you have:
- coin A, cost of production of 1 hour by human worker
- coin B, cost of production of 2 hour by human worker
B coin always have more value than A coin.

please yes, buy my first bitcoin last year so this extra time is like gold for me.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:26:41
slow adoption of bitcoin == more time to buy more bitcoin.
this is good for me.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:33:41
we need some kind of bot that post this shit every time bitcoin goes up so this poor guys can have a normal life.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:02:56
because bitcoin is mooning.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:22:39
9k tonight?
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:48:45
probably gets a little lower in the next hours, wait a little for 9100 in the best case.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:24:34
bitcoin now is basically a trench warfare-
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:51:27
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:46:57
what about taking a part out?, like 20% or 10%?, less riskier than selling all and then buying back at 9k.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:03:04
but i have a life, wanna and must buy some things like a ps4, clothes, pay internet, nextflix, music, etc.
but even investing a good amount of money every month, and at this price, 0.5btc is a hardwork.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:14:31
just buy the damn bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:58:13
it doesnt matter, if the market believes that sold all of them, then the price will dip.
The right movement was sell to one exchange-
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:31:30
"at the end of the cycle".
with 1 bitcoin at 500usd by the 2030 im happy.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:18:51
your ass is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:15:19
at least a good move. not that 0.00001 increase every 10 seconds
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:32:38
thats because this is a new bitcoin, the last one died the last month.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:19:43

@_date: 2018-03-04 23:48:20
what if bitcoin going to 12k is because of the currency wars?
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:23:34
well, the end doesn't look so bad,
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:41:42
anyone with free time to implement here?
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:12:04

@_date: 2018-03-23 21:24:19
you know what?.
our would is a finite world, the sun is going to die, gold has a limit, even universe is finite.
But then come the economists, and in they magic minds create a world were the money, a human creation is infinite. forget about using resources wisely, or thinking before acting.
no, they create a world were everything can be spend like nothing, just imagine that people designing a computer or even internet.

i have the theory that hal knew satoshi in real life, satoshi was really paranoid so he visited hal to talk about bitcoin(not email, nothing internet related), probably he used an alias to hide his name. In the same days he probably also meet with the dorian.
So when hal need a clue about how to identify satoshi on line, he used a name that hal could identify, and that name was satoshi.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:33:46
that is the kind of people who loves to buy at ATH.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:29:02

anyone missing 10k?.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:40:34
bitcoin died when we reach 6k, but another new bitcoin was created after that, and thats the bitcoin we are using right now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:34:59
what happened with the sec???
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:33:46
why people wanna buy expensive bitcoin and not cheap bitcoin?, really, i don't understand, this price, after the 20k, is like a dream, 8k, 9k, it doesn't matter.
I bought my first bitcoin just last year, not 3 or 4 years ago, and this price make me happy(not at all i don't have a job for now), but can have more bitcoin with less money.
even if you buy bitcoin at 20k, still is a good chance to get bitcoin at 50% the price on January.
20k will be reached again, tomorrow, 1 month, 1 year, its a matter of time, relax and enjoy.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:27:48

@_date: 2018-02-07 22:41:48

@_date: 2018-02-06 02:34:04

bitcoin will break 20k again, when?, thats the question.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:49:23
1300?, too high
2k?, too high.
3k?, too high
4k?, too high
5k?, too high
seriously guys, just buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:34:03
im going to repeat this.
fees need to going down now that bitcoin is going to the moon.
when bitcoin was cheap high fees was a need to keep the miners interested, but know bitcoin thats not necessary.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:30:40
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:32:50
you sell at 8k in the dip?, or sell at 8k on the rise?, the first was smart, the second stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:27:48
yep, at least take the chance to make some profits in the DIP.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:13:37

@_date: 2018-03-16 14:24:49
what about selling to usd when bitcoin is giving you loses?, then buy again?.
- buy 1k in bitcoin
- bitcoin loses 40%
- sell, now you have 600
- buy again(at least the same bitcoin)
now you can report loses, and still you have the same bitcoin amount.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:26:46
enjoy the rides, buy the dip and relax.
bitcoin is future-
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:30:23
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:52:52
great, my exchange instead of lowering the price just got more expensive.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:11:13
just wanna say thank you to anyone who sell today.

@_date: 2017-10-29 01:47:34

@_date: 2018-02-08 17:07:13
give your bitcoin to the government isn't very smart.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:58:48
tell them that to those idiot that wanna fork bitcoin everytime that the devs dont do what they want.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:16:49

@_date: 2018-03-23 18:02:52
im not saying that traders are dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:24:12
bitcoin going down?, what a smart, you should be working at wallstreet.
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:57:46
for me LN is more like a debit card, you put some money on them and you can spend without drama to buy a coffee, donuts.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:03:29
why you dont want some cheap bitcoin for a few months?
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:14:03
if there's no transaction fees, miners dont get paid, they quit and bitcoin dies.
if there's too much high fees, people dont send bitcoin, so miners dont get paid and leave and bitcoin die.
if you have enough power to attack bitcoin, it'snt better use that power to mine bitcoin and get "millonaire"?.
As long as the main rules of bitcoin arent changed, bitcoin will survive, people want money, bitcoin give you money.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:37:21
easy trading.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:31:30
thats why hodl-
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:51:27

@_date: 2017-10-31 01:59:11
what if we audit fort knox?...
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:57:58
redditor detected.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:21:45
its safe to say that at this moment any kind of "support" doesn't exist?, if this continue we can fall below 1k in less than a month.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:07:44
like 100 btc, thats why spend a lot of time on reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:52:18

bitcoin +1k  every day.
so this time everyone have time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:45:25
can you bitcoin keep at 8k until April????
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:54:07
wrong answer.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:20:27
IMO the more people use bitcoin, the more value that have bitcoin, so the less that fees can be.
imagine that bitcoin is valued in 500k, a today transaction from my exchange is about 0.0009, that will be like 400usd!!! thats insane!!!
but now, when bitcoin value is so low we need high fees to keep the miners interested.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:10:39
they wanted bigger blocks, 
they got bitcoin cash,
they wanted more decentralized minning,
they got bitcoin gold.
what the hell do you wanna now?,take your money, you have your own crypto with the name bitcoin.
please, leave us alone, really, feel free to leave.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:29:06
the best choice was accept bitcoin for petrol, and allow mining of any crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:24:28

@_date: 2018-02-10 04:09:37

@_date: 2018-02-09 01:02:19
and lambos, dont forget the lambos.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:07:23
but bitcoin is a money, not a stock, as every money isnt backed by nothing more than trust.
if more people buy bitcoin, the more trust.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:20:19
a classless society without governments is a good start for me.
because this shit of selling my body just to survive doesn't look a good idea.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:45:13
split your bitcoin, different wallets and physical.
dont wanna read that someone stole all your bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:26:17
take a look at five days graph.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:58:45
buy cheap coins when bitcoin crash, like storm(0.02usd), is so cheap that is hard to lose money, but the minimal increase in price would be like heaven.
and if doesn't pump sell, and of course avoid coins already pumped like doge.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:50:29
ladies and gentleman, prepare for moon!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:58:14
"bitcoin will fail, but blockchain will change the world".
Sadly for them, until now, aside bitcoin, zeronet and maybe lbry dont see other project using blockchain changing the world, while bitcoin is present and is already changing  the world.
and no, ethereum until now is only vaporware.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:19:51
believe in bitcoin, if bitcoin fail then we are doomed.

central bank playing with your money.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:35:32

@_date: 2018-02-08 04:22:55

@_date: 2017-10-30 02:16:07
so, when nodes join to the network, its valued add to bitcoin, like a proof of trust.
and thats also is a way to increase price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:22:27
USD has value because you need it to buy petrol.
the day that another currency can be used to buy petrol, that day will be the end of the dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:32:57
then policy seize that data center and goodbye bitcoin.
they dont need to hack the block chain, just let the idiots put all the eggs in the same places and......its gone.
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:44:56
im always bullish for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:13:16
smart contracts are interesting, having automated organizations maybe is the future.
Easy to say than easy to do.
PS: as far i know, satoshi was working in smartcontract in bitcoin but the code was removed cause could troubles.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:17:18

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:50:13
too little to late(?)
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:16:12
would be very sad if bitcoin return to 15k when get a job after 2 months of bitcoin on sale.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:32:14

@_date: 2017-10-31 01:34:12
dont worry, bigger blocks will help you a lot /s
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:37:51
what i really dont understand from people that was following bitcoin that time was that buying bitcoin was so cheap, why didnt buy some bitcoins?.
Really, how much will hurt your life speding like 10 bucks on bitcoin?.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:46:34
no, but if you have large amounts of bitcoin your a target for a thief. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:24:37

@_date: 2018-02-04 01:30:25
to the moon!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:59:41
my exchange is very strange, its like five hours delayed, and thats very dangerous because if the price goes down globally, and i sell but bounce in the next 5 or 6 hour and goes higher, when you wanna buy is higher that when you sell.
so isnt very good for quick dip, and in the little increase in price, it goes up immediately.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:46:37
this is bitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:25:40
bitfinex+tether effect?

"Payments: By eliminating the need to rely on intermediaries to approve transactions between consumers, blockchain technology could facilitate faster payments at lower fees than banks."
"Now image yourself using blockchain to pay for your transaction. It would go through almost instantly."

* 1- 1800 btc are mined daily
* 2- if those coins arent buyed at the current price, then the price will fall until that coins will be buyed.
* 3- goto 1
bitcoin isnt like gold, gold supply is controlled by price, if price increase gold production increase, if price decrease production decrease. In bitcoin 1800 coins are mined daily.
