Bitcoin Cash is nothing short of a scam, get real bitcoin instead. "BTC"

Holy shit that's an expensive house. I guess if it's in London it's normal...

It would be the reverse, they bought the moon and waiting for the dip.

Is it that much of a gamble? :( Or are you just asking what flipping means?

What do you guys think about spending half of my bitcoins to buy some alternative coins? Is it worth it in the long run or just waste of time?
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:06:35
No, not USD in Europe. I just wanted everyone to understand ;)

so... when do I sell? I dont feel like having bitcoins stored worth hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars and not do anything with it than just "hodl".

Are you expecting Bitcoin to keep raising every month for years?
@_date: 2014-05-24 11:20:36
Is this really true? I was thinking about twitching to cryptsy permanently because they keep many currencies at the same place.

Thank you, I've noticed.

I know, I just didn't know what to call it. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 09:43:46
Yes, it looks messed up. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:52:00
Just delete comment, no problem.

Are you saying you can't use bitcoin unless you turn it into fiat? That's simply not true.

You cant lose money if you don't sell. 
You still have the same amount of cryptocurrency.
