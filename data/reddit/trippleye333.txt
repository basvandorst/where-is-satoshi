Your doing such a great service!
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:32:01
Your welcome!
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:30:02
AnalyzerX7 is love. AnalyzerX7 is life.
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:44:02
This sound awesome. I would love to be part of this. I would be willing to donate a bunch to get others in here to join our big family!
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:30:21
Let's hope the decline turns around soon!
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:20:36
Why thank you : )
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:04:31
This seems pretty good, the big issue people seem to have is what if circle disappears? How big is the risk that circle would say go bankrupt or go away, I guess I can see that as concerning since the users don't have personal assess to the bitcoin codes.
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:19:59
A combination of things. But the main thing was probably people all around me becoming more and more familiar with bitcoin. Makes me think that's its becoming less of a certain brand of people niche. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:20:24
And figured it out thanks : )
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:53:03
This is the next thing I must learn how to do now!
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:52:27
Am I too late?!
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:49:05
I get bad motion sickness : /
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:26:18
Yah a good thing to remember...though...I AM ALREADY UP 50CENTS! : P
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:06:53
That is a huge and really hard in reality to grasp number. But, I wouldn't say it confuses me.
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:46:52
Thanks! The fact that it is becoming so well accepted in society was what pushed me over the edge.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:18:01
And this very sentence points to bitcoins eventual failure...
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:25:58
But your comparing a technological advancement with a currency. Technologies will always continue to advance. However, currency throughout history has always stayed relatively stagnant. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:46:22
And that is the dangerous notion I think. Trying to make a technology into a currency is a confusing and dangerous notion. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:47:46
Indeed I do! I, however, see it as more a long shot financial gamble then anything. The risk of storing value, however, is still better suited for fiat for a strong majority of people. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:17:20
I'm not sure I understand your point.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:09:39
But it is different with currency. It needs to be easy to know exactly how much you have and how much things are worth. With lives often dedicated to retirement; the knowledge of your assets is vital and should be easy.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:29:23
Again, this points to bitcoins main use just being a transfer service. In which we are spending way too much energy if that's all it is.
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:52:34
Also this...I can see this as a valid argument. An entire system shift, seems a bit excessive over bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:42:27
Yes true, but with currency I do think it is different. A simple for currency I believe is more important to keep then a more complicated way to mail things.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:24:40
A fine argument. At the same time, it seems those who support bitcoin have the tendency to overestimate in their thinking. Where bitcoin will happen because things are always confusing at first but they come around. This is a fallacy worth noting. The fact is, it will struggle to compete with fiat no matter what for the current generations. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:10:52
I am not!
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:28:54
Your username points to a slight bias. The struggle is that a successful base point of currency should not be that high if to avoid confusion. In the end, that plain and simple is more confusing.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:25:57
The phrase you can't compare apples and oranges comes to light here!
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:23:54
Invalid response
EDIT: I say invalid, because he in no way attempted to be part of the conversation with his comment. Upvoting him, demonstrates the inability to counter an argument in a civilized manner. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:16:23
Comparing apples and oranges does not work.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:22:01
I see the truth in your three points at the beginning. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:50:13
I am sure.
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:57:13
Would the fact that they have insurance on the coins be a reason to leave them there?
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:02:40
This is getting a bit off topic. But if your username was humanrights_sux4. I would say yes, you are incapable of having a two way discussion about human rights...Mr. President.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:32:33
You are, however, comparing a technological advancement with an attempted currency overhaul. Those are two vastly different things. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:16:52
I am not trying to be. No need for insults in a discussion. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:04:20
Most Americans are not mathematicians. They can handle 30.99. But if bitcoin value eventually rises (which I am assuming everyone here wants) rounding will not be an acceptable answer. For .902 will be far different from .901675383. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:39:16
Well, this I have to disagree with. The dangers of not knowing how to trade bitcoin have led and will lead to people being scammed and losing millions. Like we have already seen multiple times.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:28:32
Comparing telephones and currency is foolish.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:34:51
Is your thinking then that bitcoin would never plan to replace fiat. The ultimate goal from what I have been able to understand is fiat will be eliminated from the world acceptance of bitcoin. It seems that with so many changes, bitcoin is almost being run like a prototype.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:14:22
You are comparing technologies and currency. Currency should always be easy to understand. Of course technological advancements and the internet are confusing. Currency is not a technology - it should not be compared as such.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:30:00
Not sure where you are coming from.
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:01:02
A well put piece of writing! The one danger I can see is that bitcoin is seen as a technology. Having a technology eventually replace fiat money is a scary and confusing notion.
It could definitely play a role and replace fiat as you said, however, I do believe it would need to shift from being a technology to a more user friendly, stable, non-changing currency. Is it possible that bitcoin becomes this; it's possible - though from an objective view it would be quite the Mount Everest.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:31:16
Agreed knowledge for both is needed; but I do think from an objective standpoint, bitcoin needs a considerable more knowledge. The prince example is not the best, as the prince would much rather have some coins then trying to convince you to give him your bank account info. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:16:08
The question is, is there room for bitcoin to coexist. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:14:18
You can't compare technological advances to currency. Those are two very different things. Technological advancements will always occur, but calling currency a technology is a foolish notion. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:44:39
I do not see your point...I would love to hear from you further on this subject.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:29:46
Some very strange mental math?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:20:04
Having things digital excels because in the background the rules of cash exchange are still present. With bitcoin you lose that.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:43:49
Gotta be honest with you. You seem like you have no idea what you are talking about. 90/100 is a F in anyone's book. Your not even worth considering as a credible business. Bound to fail - sorry. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:42:41
However, it's comparing two vastly different things. Throughout history bartering and money has been a physical relatively simple exchange. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:24:32
Indeed, and since it is in such the early days, it can be hard to view it as more of a prototype.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:49:47
Waste of space here...please move along everyone
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:55:38
Some quick examples off the top of my head before I go to bed; I could come up with more tomorrow if you ask for more when I am less sleepy!!
Security of a wallet/cold storage/'bank' - more difficult and complicated then fiat security
the nature and irreversibly of bitcoin payments - the dangers of such transactions.
it's tracking nature
how 'instant' transactions work
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:06:41
I've said it before, but this is no way to help increase the credibility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:22:59
I am not screaming. This is simple an avenue for a spirited debate! I would be careful about comparing currency with technological advances like email. Those two things are vastly different.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:15:40
Unfortunately, for bitcoin to have a chance it needs those passionate to be able to intellectually explain what the advantages are. However, most people are like this...aggressive and respond only with demeaning comments. Mostly because they have nothing intellectual to add to the conversation.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:33:20
I am only pointing out that your username really limits other people to have an objective conversation with you. No need to overreact. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:53:58
Even for buying a coffee...Talking about paying in decimals for something is confusing. Saying I have .90238201 of a bitcoin seems a bit confusing does it not?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:25:09
Relative to the amount, bitcoin scams have been percentage wise much higher.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:20:06
Not trolling just trying to bring you some rational reasoning that 95% of the population will have. And the phrase you are an idiot or stop trolling will not bring them to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:13:18
That is an opinion...Though I question its validity.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:05:41
Which leaves you with how much? Knowing what you have is made more difficult because of the very nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:48:11
I promise you...everyone can find it for free haha
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:59:30
Stop making such lofty assumptions.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:44:24
My only point is I think it doesn't allow you to seem as objective in a discussion. The currency is called mbit, though.
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:05:05
A reciever transferring it to fiat does matter for the sustainability and relativity of bitcoin. If it is only used as a transfer tool, that is not really a sustainable function.
I hope to come back to your other questions tomorrow! Time for bed!
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:47:09
You can say that, but you present no refute. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:51:04
But the very nature of spending a bitcoin is more complicated. And spending at any business isn't 'really' spending a bitcoin. They are accepting it as a fiat transfer service. They will change it to fiat as soon as they receive it. 
A google search of 'trading bitcoin scam' comes up with a plethora of results that I would point too; many of which are credible. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:16:04
But that's the beauty of it. I have $100. You don't NEED to know the rest. With bitcoin, if you don't know the rest you put yourself at risk for things like fraud and stolen coins.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:18:45
A fair assessment...Though even with credit the overarching theme was that it still used dollars in its transfer.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:49:03
It does not use a trusted third party, nor can it be trusted...dangerous and confusing.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:27:30
Yet at the very heart of currency was the physical. Whether you could see the sheep being traded or the dollar being given or not. There was always backing to currency. Technologies should help us use currency; technology should not be a currency.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:10:40
But 90 million is a number you only use with dollars in rare circumstances. Dealing with it for daily transactions would be a mess. With bits, it would be a daily circumstance. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:12:41
That is the very issue I have. Currency should not be considered a technology. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:28:19
Technology can help transfer currency, but should never replace currency.
I don't understand your second point. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:45:10
But not understanding fiat fully is less dangerous then not understanding bitcoin fully.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:16:44
No sir! Only trying to stir the intellectual debate!
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:23:39
This very theory is the reason bitcoin is dangerous. Knowing less and less puts you in a dangerous position to get scammed and lose more and more bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:30:57
What I am saying is the general population will never seek to understand it, which will lead to its eventual failure if that does not approve. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:59:07
Truth hurts my friend
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:32:36
Do you have a point to add?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:21:18
A good response. I would argue that not knowing many of the technicals can be a dangerous notion when it comes to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:38:03
It's ok, obviously people are passionate!
If the goal isn't to replace all fiat, it would seem then that bitcoin is more of a transportation vehicle for fiat money to just change forms. That or just a way of eliminating fees from exchanges; which seems like quite a lot of work
