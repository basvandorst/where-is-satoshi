That's pretty cool. Looks like you've spent alot of time on it!

Human readable address will be a giant leap for bitcoin adoption. When I first saw a bitcoin address I thought to myself. WTF is this?

Personally I've never had an issue with Coinbase as an online  wallet. As for storing larger amounts I would recommend buying a trezor hardware wallet or paper wallet so you don't have to trust anyone else with your private keys. If you don't hold your keys, you don't really own your bitcoin.

I placed an order on Amazon yesterday the 6th with my Shift card and it pulled from my Coinbase account 7 times and drained all the Bitcoin from my wallet! I look on amazon order details and it says my card was declined due to insufficient funds. Amazon says they didn't receive any money. Have not heard back yet from Shift Payments or Coinbase on this issue. I need my Bitcoin back!
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:46:23
Yes, They were able to refund all the transactions back to my account.

Here is a better explanation @ 
I also added a new feature @

The upcoming block reward halving.

You can either spend it, sell it, or hodl (hold) it. I'd recommend to hodl it until it's more valuable and then spend it.
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:44:33
Very exciting but a little scary. There's a lot of changes all at once.

10-60 minutes for confirmation is not very long compared to days with traditional banking. Maybe some new company will offer insurance for zero confirmation transactions under a certain amount.

I am sorry for your loss.

I've been using Coinbase for years and I've never had an issue. I use it to buy Bitcoin and if you store you're bitcoin in your vault, even if someone did guess your password,  when withdrawing from there, it's a 2 day waiting period, double email verification and cell phone access code auth. BUT if you are planning on not following their agreement, I'd recommend something else. For large amounts of BTC I use a Trezor hardware wallet.

The difficulty adjusts roughly every two weeks. IMO this drop is healthy for the price of Bitcoin. It's like when the water recedes right before a tsunami.  
Buy more and hodl forever. I'd rather loose money from the price going down to 0 than wish I would have bought after it goes to the moon.
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:27:23
I spend my Bitcoin whenever I can then I immediately buy back a little more Bitcoin than what I spent.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:06:37
This price drop is like the sea receding before a tsunami.
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:47:44
This is only the second big bubble! Probably shouldn't buy after the price skyrockets and the only reason it bubbles is because people are buying in.
@_date: 2016-06-23 13:55:15
Everyone is flipping out that bitcoin is crashing down to 150 dollars above what it was.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:40:14
Once Bitcoin has mainstream adoption, why would you ever want to "sell" them for obsolete fiat currency? I would still want my Bitcoin if I could never sell it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:59:50
Are you thinking like a website store or physical store? And what are stacks? Like a kit or box?
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:49:02
When I said it was scary, it doesn't mean I don't fully support it! I was just stating that there's a lot of changes and even changing very small things make me nervous.
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:31:33
I am glad Bitcoin does not change too fast. Slow and steady wins the race.

I want nothing more than the moon but it's gonna take some extra oomph to break through the atmosphere. I'm hoping brexit + halving = moon
@_date: 2016-02-28 20:48:31
Codacoin.com uses a moving average that hasn't moved much. Just takes the average time to solve a block and uses that to predict a halving date.

Bitcoin is up $10.00 in 24 hours today.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:56:39
It seems like they would accept Bitcoin as payment. But sadly only paypal.

Looks like the blog post is part of a larger document I pulled from his xml feed from his page.

Now there's a video! -&gt; 
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:51:23
Thanks for the video! I hope you're right.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:05:06
It is actually a weighted average of the price of Bitcoin.

Tomorrow is my birthday and I hope I get my wish. To the Moon!

Everyone should buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:00:35
If I included those exchanges then there is no point in adding any other exchanges since OKCOIN and Houbi consist of over 95 percent of the volume. I might as well just display those exchanges exclusively.

Yes. A very good article.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:02:47
That is exactly what I am going for. I was tired of waiting for a whole page full of ads to load just to see the price on my cellphone with 2 bars of 3g. If you want more detail, click on the price.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:30:44
Haha. Well only 21 million of them. In some years, it'll be rare for one person to have 1 whole bitcoin.
