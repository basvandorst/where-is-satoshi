I somewhat understand you logic, but I think you would care.  If you spend $1000 on bitcoin at $600/coin you get 1.7 bitcoins v 1.4 bitcoins at $700/coin.  Should it go to $70,000/coin that difference is an extra ~$17,000 per $1,000 invested.  If it goes to $7,000/coin thats an extra ~$1,700 per $1,000 invested
If you dont want that 17K, I would happily take it.

Sorry guys, we ran out of money on the exchange to buy bitcoins with due to the overwhelming amount of people that want to buy bitcoins at this price. And since it's the weekend, we are not able to wire money to them until Monday. So we can either turn on delayed buys (the price you buy the coin is not locked in) or we set both the buy and sell price to be higher so that we get more people selling coins to us. People are upset with both options, but unfortunately we don't have much choices as fiat doesn't move around on weekends like Bitcoin does.
No, we are not pulling a money-grab. If you are selling bitcoins, you will find that our price right now is $30 higher. Where else can you get $720 for a bitcoin right now? If it was a money grab, our buy and sell price would not both be at $720.
Honestly, from my point of view, the price on Coinbase is closer to the "real" bitcoin price. As it's the price where the sell and buy demand evens out. The reason why BitStamp price is lower is because people don't have fiat on BitStamp to buy at this low price just like we don't. So there's more selling pressure on the exchanges.

If he is just using it as a merchant, he wont have any coins.  All of those complaints look like wallet issues not merchant exchange for fiat issues.

Since banks are the only way to move large amounts of money (until bitcoin), it is only natural they are the largest money launderers.  Doctors also commit the most medical mal-practice.  Clean it up!

Four YEARS ago?  Think you need to consult your timeline. Hint: Bear collapsed six years ago.  Otherwise, I agree
