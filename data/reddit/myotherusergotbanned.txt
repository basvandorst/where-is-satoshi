I meant service providers not auth providers
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:04:33
A lot of providers just use a text as a second factor.

Didn't everyone already accept segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:36:32
Does it? If you're talking about savings accounts, they haven't provided a return that beats inflation in decades.

Idk does your crypto wallet charge you crypto to keep crypto in the wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:15:19
I think binance is crypto coins only (so I've heard). Gemini looks good and they have ach which is a win.

Right, because there still has to be some incentive to process transactions. Look up the transaction fees of Visa, MasterCard, stripe, etc. You don't see it, but you do pay for it.
Edit:ATM fees?

It split and "people clamored".

Idk exactly what it is as a financial vehicle but it stands for automated clearing house. It's batch processing of bank transactions. Most every utility company in the US uses it for bill pay.

For sure. I thought about that too. It very well might not be anything to begin with. But someone on I want to say personal finance was talking about it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:41:30
People don't know that though.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:37:11
For sure, but some don't I imagine. Just a PSA
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:51:37
Lol, no. They even have big red letters on the support page that their identity verification partner is overloaded. I tried like 6/7 times before it said that I can't try anymore. Beyond that, it sounds like from a community prespective coinbase kinda sucks.

If this is being pushed by bitcoin.org (core team?) It would be nice to have a roadmap...

? You can always wipe your keys to another wallet. Unless you literally don't know anything and just have a login or something (which is ok, but maybe btc isn't for you right now).

I'm sure people realize theres any number of nuances that can't be encompassed by a documentary
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:13:34
It's a colloquialism... 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:08:48
That's not empathy though. People are here because they are interested in BITCOIN. You don't want to support BITCOIN. Who exactly do you have empathy for?
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:08:46
No no no, there is ONLY ONE BITCOIN. It IS the main whitepaper. That's it. There's other crypto currencies. Some of them even try to be marketable by using the bitcoin name as part of their name so people can make money on them. But there is one bitcoin. It's not about "plenty of people" defining anything. There's no marketing spin to be had here. There. Is. One. Bitcoin. The community is probably not even really in a schism. It was with bitcoin cash too and that never went anywhere. 2x is literally defined as a hostile chain. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:52:22
So how does that make sense then? If we're not at a fork yet, how is the other chain being mined so heavily? If its old 2x (the last 2x for bit coin cash) I thought that coin has not fared well

Further than that, who runs this site?
This is their wallet address with 5 grand in it. Whos contributing to this and why?
edit: "Community-driven Bitcoin statistics and services." For a community driven site, I can't find anything about it. A private whois and very little interaction isn't very "community" to me.

"Segwit2X has 95% of the hashing power" how do you determine that? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:21:04
I like it. It's now part of my vocabulary.
