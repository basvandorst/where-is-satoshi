Jeremy did a really fantastic job, as well as Omaha's own Matt McKeever, a local attorney active with bitcoin who actually came to the conference and became a panelist as a result of this reddit post. Video is compressing onto Dropbox right now, will hopefully post soon. 
Great to meet you today Jeremy! Thanks for a great discussion!

Great suggestion but I couldn't figure out how to sign up or get started. Clicking on get started just took me to a blog post about the project.

Just glanced at it but that's a nice looking graphic on how it works. Going to have to go get a cupcake now. Nice work guys.

Sounds good, I just posted this to our Omaha Bitcoin meetup group too. Not sure how many we'll get on short notice but might be a couple. I'll be sure to hit you up afterwards. Really glad I checked reddit tonight haha.

This is normal volatility for bitcoin. Any asset that appreciates as quickly as bitcoin has is going to have periods of pullback due to profit-taking and the need for real-world functionality to catch up to price. A certain percentage of new investors will buy and hold for a longer term; a certain percentage will sell at the first sign of slowdown and not get back in until the next bubble.

Gates is basically talking about Bitcoin's competition. One of Bitcoin's apps is banking the unbanked, but if the MPesas of the world accomplish this before bitcoin then it'll be harder for bitcoin to gain that market once it is already saturated with good mobile money alternatives.
