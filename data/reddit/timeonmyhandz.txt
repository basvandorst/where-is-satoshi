Download a paper wallet and send BTC to it from coinbase..  Then give them the paper and show them how to make their own account or other wallet..

I am not an expert in any way.. Buy that never stopped me before..
I don't see how changing the ownership of an asset would reduce / avoid  taxes.  Possibly moving the asset from one entity(you) to a corporation (its an entity) could even trigger taxable gains to you. 
SubS and LLC are not immune to taxes..  They pass through their earnings to the shareholders where they are taxed.
Best way to minimize is to hodl for at least a year and take the lower capital gains rate. probably helps a bit on that topic.

Snow ability to sell on CB.  Who could buy?

Are you buying from a bank account or from a USD wallet on CB?

I know what you mean.. Flick flick flick until the price you want hits..  Worse thing is the alert never goes off..  At least for me..

Research "wash Sales" rules before taking these actions.

I think it is still less than the energy to mine gold..

Curious what would be considered taxable about BC?  Not the fluctuation of the currency...   So trading?  Evidence of income?

Aren't there bitcoin ATMs for this?

High quality reference there.. Thanks.    It should be stickied somewhere if not already.   I am wondering if wash sale rules could start to apply..  Crypto in that grey area of property, but having some rules similar to securities.

With a warrant, all information for any transaction can be discovered.  When the law confiscates all your computers, cell phones and collects records from your ISP, what don't you think will be found?

I've not researched this topic in depth..  So curious..  And NOT on topic with the OP...  But I feel like my few transactions of Bitcoin are easily traced to me..  I purchased on an exchange that has my full identity verified..  I transferred the coins to my wallet That has an account on line with a login and email address..  I don't exactly feel anonymous..   Are you indicating the peer to peer is where anonymity applies?  As in the public address I give to someone has no discoverable relationship to with my wallet or exchange accounts?

If a global event destroyed all the power sources on the globe, some country's "money" in your hands would be just as worthless..  Aliens won't take either!

Unsettling they updated the app and it dropped my android PIN that was set...   Not much respect for security settings...
