Greenspan is well-respected, and during his time as fed chairman markets were up 380%.  I think he did A-OK.

This.  r/bitcoinmarkets has intelligent discussion.  r/bitcoin seems like a bunch of people with little/no investing or trading experience.

do more reading, because if you have to ask reddit (of all places!), you are probably not ready.
But, some tidbits:
1. Dont put all your eggs in one basket, diversify, if you want some bitcoin, put no more that 25% of your investment in it.  the other 75% buy other things, stocks, bonds.
2. Dont invest an entire sum in 1 time, space it out over 3-4 Buys, so you can buy on the dips.  Also, trade around your position.  If you are up  big, take some money off the table and wait to put it back when there is a price drop.

oh, that is cool, I did not know that.
Is the bitcoin conversion accurate to the current exchange rate?  I ask because I see some sites that accept bitcoin are only doing it for novelty purposes, and the price, when converted back to USD, is significantly higher (just check out pizzaforcoins.com as an example).  
That type of thinking, that buying something with bitcoin just because it's bitcoin, regardless that the price is extremely inflated, is not exactly appealing for people just starting to get into the currency.

So buy bitcoin with USD, then buy gift cards with bitcoin in  USD amounts to use at stores. Seems kinda like an extra step to me. I'm all for bitcoin, it's just not there yet, and these multiple transactions just seem, odd.

posts like these are why I am patiently waiting on the sidelines.  People with no trading or investing experience just shouting out random numbers.  In my short time (10 years) of investing experience I have seen some some stocks go parabolic and then come back to reality.  One tell-tale sign is people picking random price targets (see: apple at $700, people were saying $1000, $2000 before a one year plunge back to sub $400, or more recently Tesla) and another is everyone and their mom knowing about it and discussing it at dinner.  This christmas, see what the discussions are about.  If it is bitcoin, it has come too far, too fast.  Thats not saying there is no potential, because I feel there is.  But the random posts 100 times a day of "bitcoin is going to 5000 or 100000 or 1 million" just reassure me that patience is key right now.

You must hate bernanke then , since rates have been between 0-.25 for years.

exactly, when the largest bitcoin market does not support it, well, let's just say it could be better.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:28:28
yeah, ok.  the largest bitcoin market just stated yesterday that they are not ready to accept bitcoin as currency, so this price drop seems pretty reasonable to me.  
but yeah, "these mooks be gettin' cray cray."  or something.
