Thanks. Can you give me some suggestion on how to hire people?
is it feasible to hire people on site such as freelancer? Or it's better to hire people locally?
I ever hired one India guy 2 years ago on one project via freelancer.com, and I felt he was very perfunctory. (At that time I did not see any ***big*** price difference between Indian and Westerners.)
@_date: 2015-06-06 05:53:46
he eagerly wants du*g now!

You know, so many people thought there are only 21M whole coins. So I always suggest people to buy 0.7 btc, instead of 1 btc.
Edit for mistake.

Nice try, Mr. Roger Var. Can you use your own account to post, instead of creating so many fake accounts ridiculously? So many people are laughing at you, Mr. Roger Var. XD
Okcoin CEO Star Xu and Btcchina Ceo Bobby Lee are the only two people in China who believe Bitcoin has no doubt bright future. So, don't excoriate them and stop telling lies to prove your - Mr Roger Var's selfishness and greedy.

You seem not to be "in love with this technology". What you care about is capital appreciation.
Similarly, if you own some stock of one company, what you are caring is "In which way can we make the stock's price keeping arising", instead of "how can this company succeeds in competition and create value to benefit the society."
That is what I think.
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:45:22
the difference is, I believe bitcoin is used to benefit society, while you think it's used to break rules.
So, you have many and many friend who steal/defraud others that help you. You keep downvoting posts like mine. But listen, you are only bugs that are hurting bitcoin. Stop saying you are Bitcoin believer, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:26:06

I won't encourage is the centralization of the network and this kind of tracking activity happening 'at the top' of the Bitcoin network, too.
BTW, It's clear you are not native English speaker, and what I emphasized again and again is "Bitcoin is so good, that we should do things to prevent criminals stealing/defrauding others' bitcoin"
You got it this time? It's really not a pleasure since you can't understand what I am saying from beginning, and, sorry but you are really lack of logic.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:50:51

Again, legal does not mean immoral.
The criminal is not god, and criminal do not equal morality.
If you want to aid criminal build tools to help them but it is not Bitcoin's job to help you do it.
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:21:04
In first post, I said if we can do enough things to prevent "theft/fraud", the price can go to 10k. And later you said "we need those bad actors".
Do you still think we need "thieves/scammers who steal/defraud others' bitcoin"?
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:03:11
Criminals exits in society, but we should try best to find/punish them and stop criminality. Instead of being indifferent and think it's normal and moral.
Criminals exits in society, but we should try best to find/punish them and stop criminality.  Instead of being indifferent and think it's normal and moral. So Bitcoin can benefit society instead of being used by criminals to hurt society.
If you are indifference to criminal, please don't say you appreciate righteousness.
That's what I try to teach you. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:13:17
bad actors will scare normal people away.  Hence it will impair the userbase. 1 bad actor will frighten at least 10 people away. (I admit that some bad actors really helps the price at the beginning.)
Yes there certainly are something illegal but moral, for example drugs as for me. (I never bought any)
But there are scary theft/fraud that frighten most people away. And now they are the critical factor that hinder the price.

You can't say a man is honest if he like Mr. Roger Ver renounced US citizenship to avoid tax and support scams such as ripple.
This time Mr. Roger Ver gets into trouble because Mr. okcoin is not to be trifled. And have plenty of tactics and fans &amp; tricks and money, like Mr. Roger Ver.

but if it's not easy/able to get back original file, why bitcoind auto delete the wallet.dat and create that "wallet.14*****.bak"?
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:29:05
Yes you will understand him when you admit the fact that 50% of community members are fraudsters, and another 30% are only knowing downvoting bad news.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:31:58
Thank you, you mean that I can get back my money with "wallet.142*****.bak" 99%?
I rename it (this time backuped) but every time I launch bitcoind it says error. thanks
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:32:23
I forgot to do that, sigh
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:05:40
Thanks. It's not the same file. It's another different useless file. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:35:23
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:41:14
Also this new generated "wallet.142*****.bak" only has a size of 112k.
@_date: 2015-04-12 14:25:43
that's the 1st thing i thought about when this issue happened. But I don't know how to restore it......
@_date: 2015-04-12 14:27:08
Thank you. But I tried several times, every time fails.
About 5 months ago, everything works ok. I am sure nothing in this laptop changed.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:54:50

Thank you my friend.

pywallet could not extract keys. such error 
While same command can extract keys of new generated "normal" wallet.dat
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:06:33
Oh no, that file is balance 0. No.
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:42:14
Yes you are not alone, so does scammers and thieves.
Anyway, if you want 100% anonimity, you can switch to xmr.
@_date: 2015-04-12 23:21:01
I have db.log and wallet.412*(timestamp).dat
In fact that's just the wallet.dat. Because in the command history I saw "***rename*** wallet.dat to wallet.412***(timestamp).dat"
But it's only 112k, which makes me a little worried. Because there are some transactions on it so I don't think it shall be only 112k.
Anyway I think this file has enough data although I can't take it out.
I tried and tried, with various command lines.  Still fails.
@_date: 2015-04-12 14:03:30
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:14:09

@_date: 2015-04-12 12:29:33

XMR is the coin you want
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:55:42
Reason: Community proven its strength. And China
1. can't stop same phishing attempts for years, and mostly indifference, except downvote.
2. can't stop exchanges/fraudulent services from running away with money, and have nothing to do with the webmaster such as Mark Karples, except downvote.
3. The bitcoind software most people are using is buggy, for years, And the bitcoin foundation don't care about people's money.
4. In China the stock market is very very bull now, So they quit.
5. Big investors decided not to buy coins from those thieves, nor bump price to let scammers profit.
@_date: 2015-04-12 23:29:24
Thanks. Do you think the file was damaged by bitcoind when it was renamed? Because the new file only has a size of 112k. I think it's a little small because there were. some transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:38:20

Thank you, but as a tech noob, I don't know how to do it exactly.
@_date: 2015-04-13 00:21:12
So the important thing is to let the bitcoind recognize corrupted wallet.dat.
@_date: 2015-04-13 00:02:49
Downloaded, however, seems neither can import any .dat from bitcoind
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:20:12
Really? I think it will not be included.
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:44:52
