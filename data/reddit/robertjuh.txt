 I can give the best TL;DR for you:
"Look at me! There's also some women in crypto!"

"bubble will pop" etc etc etc

he writes an article and keep it as simple as possible for many people to understand. This isnt a tech magazine (afaik?) so he doesnt have to go over the technicalities so that readers get lost, thats not the idea

i think they're trying to tell us that there's some women in crypto. Obviously. Science has told that men are in general more interested in tech and women in general more in things.
However, there's a spectrum in personality types (and note, i used teh term "in general") so there's variances and outliers. This does NOT mean this is the norm. And these statistics (4 to 6 % of women in crypto) prove this theory. Now people could make the case that women arent encouraged to do tech, well neither was I, but i still chose this sector because i think it's interesting.
About the sexist remarks part, that's how subcultures bond. Go to construction work, these guys arent nice to eachother all the times, they make harsh jokes to eachother and if they learn to take the jokes (and even better, make jokes back, and EVEN BETTER: prove that they can do this work with extraordinary competence despite them being "bullied") they will get mad respect. So if women want to operate in a male dominated space, they have to adapt, same goes for female dominated spaces.

The money you pay him goes directly into him buying youtube ads. Then people make youtube video's debunking tai lopez. Tai lopez commercial plays.
Congrats Tai, you played yourself, the money you extract from people goes to people that criticise you
