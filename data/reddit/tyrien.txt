Wouldn't that be how he set it up to receive the payment though?

Most recent version isn't the trash bag that IE 8 or lower was.

I'm not an expert, but couldn't this be stopped simply by flooding the frequency they are running on with interference?

Interesting. 
Is... it possible you were using a plugin meant for paypal donations? 
Sounds like something went wrong somewhere rather than paypal being at fault. I can see where they were coming from, because from their eyes the payments you were receiving were *appearing* to be circumventing their system.

No, it's more that they won't add new hardware until they can see a marketable use for it. They won't make the APIs open until they're confident that they can safely and securely maintain them. 
I'm not happy about it, but I can understand why they would do it this way. The last thing they'd want is to have an API for the NFC then find out there's a problem that can be exploited.

Probably because the logistics and economics of having it implemented in a household were outside of scope at the time. Obviously the tech became more common, costs went down, and infrastructure slowly grew. It became more feasible.

They're newer revisions have gotten better, actually.

From the way this reads you were taking bitcoin payments and having them sent into your paypal account? 
or is it as others have said and that your customers were sending you personal payments, which is free but designed so one person can easily send another money? It's not meant for merchant transactions.

I said marketable. 
Apple pay has an obvious gain for the company. They stated they have been working on it for a while now as well. There wasn't a clean and cut reason to put ncf on an iPhone before.

I don't think those are mutually exclusive activities. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:16:03
It will be hard to account for. You can keep things in bitcoin only but then you can only buy and sell items with bitcoin. 
You'd still pay sales tax on that if the country you're buying from taxes for online transactions. Even then there's still a possibility you'd receive a duty when the package enters the boarder. 
If you try and dodge the tax on gains when you cash the bitcoin back to CND, then you're pretty much screwed if you get audited.

I believe it's anything over $10,000 a bank is required by law to report to CRA. Though I believe a bank is also allowed to report at their own discretion if they have a reasonable cause. 
Like... say you're making a weekly deposit of $1000 that's not a payroll source. As far as I'm aware (and I can be wrong) a bank is within their rights to report the activity.

Capital gains tax is paid on the difference. 
So if you (example) 
Bought 10 units of bitcoin for $100, and sold 10 units for $100 there's no difference and nothing to be taxed. However if you sold those 10 units for $200 you'd be taxed on the $100 difference. Same principle as investing in the stock market or with investment products. You pay a tax on the difference. Each country's rate is different. 
You'd only be taxed when you bring that money back into the Canadian economy. Just as if you were buying and selling foreign currency.
Now *if* you're handling all of this yourself then you can try and avoid the tax by not claiming it when you file income tax. The problem is banks are required by law to report deposits over certain sizes, and will report suspicious activity to the CRA. If you're audited and cannot account for the income then you'll be fined. This would be no different than buying and selling on the stock market, being audited, and not being able to justify why you didn't pay tax on your earnings. On a side note, earnings from lottery/casino winnings are not taxed in Canada. 
If you're running a business and accepting bitcoin then you're not buying bitcoin, you're taking it in. You'd need to convert that bitcoin to Canadian dollars and you'd need to claim that as income/revenue through your business. 
You could keep the bitcoin and spend it on places that only take bitcoin, but you'd still be subjected to sales tax if the region your shop is based in charges tax for online transactions.
**tl;dr** you're taxed if you earn money off of of buying and selling bitcoin. It's the same as buying and selling stocks. You'd be smart to claim it on your income tax or you'd end up losing more if you're audited by the CRA and cannot account for the extra income. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:13:12
Obviously? 
You can keep it as bitcoin and there's no real way for CRA, or any other Tax organization in a government to track and tax you on it. 
However, when you convert the bitcoins into your country's currency then you'll have to claim it as income. 
Likewise, bitcoins are more than able to be taxed for sales if the business is Canadian. Online transactions are taxed in Canada and subject to HST. There's no reason sales with bitcoin shouldn't be taxed the same way.

Hm. Seems like it was poorly explained to me then. The way it was explained to me was a very high rate. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:18:05
In all likelyhood that would be the case. 
The message that I take isn't that bitcoin is to receive a special tax. The message I'm getting is that it will be treated like buying and selling stocks or foreign currency. It just happens that, as far as I'm aware, Bitcoin is the most volatile currency at the present time (which is why it's being treated like buying and selling stocks)
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:54:07
Depends how you're receiving the bitcoins.
If you're a business and you accept bitcoins then it's still income. 
If you're buying and selling, then yes that'd be capital gains. In Canada, as far as I know, capital gains tax is pretty high. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:22:18
I don't think that was meant as "we ended it". as much as it was meant "we proved how useless it is".

I can't speak much for the US tax system but...
Ask yourself, how are you getting those Euros back into your hands? I'd assume you'd have an account with your bank to deposit them in. In that case you still need to account for that when you file taxes.
If you have the money being held in an account located in Europe... well still the question is, what are you going to tell the IRS if they audit you? 
What you need to consider is your overall net gain when the currency converted into USD within the year. So if you buy $100 worth and sell it later for $120 Euros (which is around a 57% gain with the current USD to Euro rate) that means you really have about $157 USD. So at the end of the year you'd be subject to tax on that $57. 
Now $57 probably isn't something to worry about. The point is that if you were audited then you'd have to explain that $57.
I *believe* if you're dealing with stocks/currency through a broker then the tax can be paid when you cash out. If you're dealing with it as an individual then you'd need to report it when you file your income tax. That's honestly just a guess though because you can gain and lose so you'd have an overall net number to be concerned with when it comes to tax time. 
Again, not a US resident, so I cannot comment on that with confidence.   Not even claiming to be an expert. Just interpreting this. Someone else may know more than I do.
