Extrinsic means it can be *used* outside of being a currency.  Like gold is extrinsic, silver is extrinsic, hell even SEEDS are extrinsic.  An overpriced digital currency has ZERO extrinsic value.

The USE of gold is the extrinsic.  The properties of gold are the intrinsic.  I am not confused by this.  Its the USE of gold, that gold can be USED by outside forces, is what gives it value.

Until that bitcoin shows up in my digital account and they can see that it has gone from one account to another.

Okay I've got the definitions backwards, sorry it has been a long day.  


Which means that they have a "stake" in making it work, which means they aren't thinking clearly.  They've brainwashed themselves, kind of like how religious people hold onto their beliefs in the face of logic, since they've devoted so much of their life to it, they can't see it as anything else.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:20:53
I said EXTRINSIC value.  Seriously when will you fools learn how to read?  see how hostile you get when people question these concepts?  Its turning into a religion for you people.  You should take a step back and examine your fanatical religious views on this "special" money that was given to you on a silver platter.

Good luck with that lol.

Someone has to set the price based on the S&amp;D.  The exchanges are getting their info from *somewhere*...
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:23:12
My "argument" isn't an argument, its a what if.  A digital currency pushed exclusively to libertarians/an-caps, for years on all of the talk shows, who are usually rallying around hard currency like gold and silver.  Sounds fishy.  That's all I'm suggesting.  Get the people who should be most against something to be all for it in order to minimize resistance.  Its a war tactic.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:40:41
What central authority sets the price of Bitcoin?  The exchanges are getting the information from somewhere, they're not all just pulling the price out of the ether.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:36:52
No but that transaction can be taxed.  People who are defending this system aren't thinking in terms of how the government will step in.  They want a consumption tax and transaction taxes, which is impossible with cash payments between private individuals, but if you've got two digital coins you're trading, they can see that those digital coins have been traded and can charge a nice tax onto that transaction in the middle.  Think of the relatively simple technology that would take.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:47:47
But I know it can be tracked, that it IS tracked and that governments and big corporations are starting to "accept" it, that is all I need to know to know that it is a scam.  In order for you to understand that its a scam, you should do a little history reading.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:43:46
Who says they haven't already and are letting it rise in price so as to draw as much attention to it as possible? just in time for a dollar collapse, bam, New World Digital Currency?  
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:12:32
*exactly*.  They MARKET IT to the libertarians.  What do we all know about propaganda?  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:48:25
So the headlines "Bitcoin at $800" is based off of the exchanges jacking up the price or people shelling that much out for them?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:46:08
thank you for being open minded.  I'm getting called a tinfoil hatter over here for suggesting this even though its more plausible than a random digital currency becoming the way to "stick it to the man" so to speak.   
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:24:44
I'm not arguing for a centrally controlled anything.  Also to think that bitcoin will not be co-opted or hasn't been is ridiculous.  If it was a threat it wouldn't be talked about in corporate mainstream news.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:35:01
I've thought about it a lot.  It seems plausible.  Doesn't take much to buy advertising on Free Talk Live or any other libertarian/an-cap show or website.  That's all it takes.  If you look at it from a globalist perspective they need to neutralize the enemy to the system, best way to do it is to get them to embrace the new system and somehow embrace it as their own.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:49:37
YES.  I just made a post about this and got downvoted to oblivion.  It was pushed at the libertarian/ancaps FIRST, as in the people who would be most against a world digital currency, so they could minimize resistance.  It makes total sense from a globalist perspective.  ALL the big libertarian/ancap sites and radio shows push bitcoin HARD and have been for years.  They're making it seem like its somehow a good idea to the people who should be most against it!!
edit: not to mention they've managed to make people religiously fanatical about bitcoin so that any criticism is met with comments like this: ["You won't understand it unless you've got a degree in computer science, or have an equivalent knowledge base. It simply isn't possible."](
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:49:19
I am definitely suggesting this.  They've been conditioning people to accept a digital only currency for the last few decades.  Government would *love* a digital only currency.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:57:13
they were before though too.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:09:33
The non-digital currencies are on the way out, hence the constant inflation.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:33:53


This sentence right here is EXACTLY what I said. For example: Gold has extrinsic value because its external substance is malleable and is used for all sorts of things, it has VALUE.  Jesus, you have ZERO reading comprehension.  No wonder you fall for this shit.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:05:21
Okay, what's stopping them from taxing the printing of the paper?  
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:32:11
Like I've said in other replies.  Bitcoins have been *pushed* at libertarian/an-cap types via the echochamber talk radio stations for years now.  I've watched the "community" literally form with very clever advertising.  The libertarian/an-cap types are the people who traditionally are all about hard money and were the people warning of digital currencies, then all of a sudden the radio stations started promoting this new "wonder currency" that was somehow now totally cool even though its not hard money.  
Its a war tactic, you get the people who will put up the most resistance and you convince them, using their "celebrity" radio shows, that its actually a good idea.  This minimizes resistance and legitimizes it to everyone else who isn't paying attention.  I'm looking at this from a historical standpoint, I've read the technocratic books about how they would love a global digital currency to go along with their global government.  Who resists global government and global anything?  Libertarians and anarcho-capitalists... Just saying.  
edit:   You're going to say that guy *isn't* an agent? Come on...
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:30:26
I've looked into it enough to know that anything digital *can* be tracked and *will be* tracked and *is* tracked, I don't care what the bitcoin pushers have told you, its totally trackable, there's no way it ISN'T trackable.
