I did hedge my position by placing a ETH long and it did fantastic, thanks. I don't like shorting anything and I wish btc the best.

They have a very bad and flawed design in the first place. Wouldn't it better putting up a basket of Kraken, Gdax, Bitstamp, Gemini(all regulated exchanges) bitcoin price, to better anchor ETF pricing. Their proposal is very stupid, or outright manipulative.

This is of course a very critical reason, take a look at the full comment from SEC and discussion of Gemini's thin liquidity and order book and how it is inappropriate to anchor a ETF pricing. The full comment also discuss about the influence of Chinese bitcoin exchanges( which is outdated, blame SEC for not catching up with the latest development).

Yes, same as bitcoin and better, transaction cost is around 0.15 cents, seconds confirmation time and no back log.

Wow, wait until Ethereum implement it and it all will be too late, bitcoin is MySpace and Ethereum is flipping history. Bitcoin fails because all led by big egos and ignorant kids, Greggy and his associate dipshits alike.

According to the Chinese translation, summary: 
1. Core defaulted on HK consensus and doesn't honor 2M increase. 
2. Chinese miners to unite to implement Classic which supports 2M increase and SegWit
3. Urge all miners to unite to support the Terminator Plan - ( i think it implies to terminate Core's 0.13.1 which doesn't honor HK consensus). 
This is truly a war by miners against CORE.

You bet it is just a random proposal, 8btc is the largest Chinese bitcoin community and they are mobilizing miners

sorry, it is still 200% a China factor,driving this bull, bet for a crash.

Shorting is the best way to bankrupt yourselves and centralized bitcoin is not a good candidate to put your faith into, bitcoin is manipulated heavily, just take a look at how many bitcoin longs hit the margin calls over the past 24 hrs(Huobi, OKCoin, Bitfinex ), bitcoin can't even stand a bit of Chinese rumor, people with their right mind would not place their house on it. 
Anyone using 10x leverage to short eth/btc over the past 24 hrs already hit their margin call, shorting eth is the stupidest strategy at this juncture ( upcoming Gnosis, Golem ICO and HF2, Chinese bitcoin ban, these events are going to fire up ether 10-20% at any moment)

Interested to hear your views on Ethereum and whether you have any plan to list ETH in your exchange.
