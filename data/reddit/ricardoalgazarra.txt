Backing away from the decision of socializing only btc losses among btc holders is a major mistake and it will doom the exchange.
How do you expect to get profits to repay your customers? Everyone was already scared, after seeing their accounts being messed around even though the funds survived the heist is doubling the fear.
Don't use people's money to cover your incompetence. That's bad PR not only for BFX but for crypto too. Issue tokens to replace your clients btc and use profits to buy back the tokens.
We all need a healthy trading community to get whole again.

this should be addressed pronto. If BFX doesn't clearly state that there will be a progressive buyback or some kind of fee dividend to repay everyone in a timely manner there's nothing backing those tokens.
Right now I don't see how this token will retain the 1usd face value

Withdrawals shouldn't be enabled without trading. Users with no usd bank accounts will be severely hurt by this.

BFX won't be successful if they socialize losses across assets. They must retain the problem and deal with it on the side while the rest of the assets go back to trading and profiting. Everyone will go away with whatever they can still grab and the exchange will collapse if EVERYONE gets hit with 36% without one single proof of LE involvement.

Enabling withdrawals without trading is also limiting any chances of cashing out usd for people that no longer use banks... This is becoming a huge mess. Socializing the losses across other assets is a huge huge mistake

Worst PR campaign possible and surely dooming the exchange and any hopes of getting those 36% back

Is BFX buying the tokens back? Paying some sort of dividend from fee profits every week?
I don't get the token plan. If it isn't backed up by something it will simply crash

I have to agree, I don't see why holders of other currencies should pay for the stolen BTC. These are different "currencies" for a reason. If anyone has to pay is bitfinex. No one else is at fault. So why bring the problem of part of your users to the whole community. Why not give the tokens to the ones who were stolen and leave the rest of the community actively trading? IMHO, it's the only real way bitfinex can rise again
BTC holders would get tradeable tokens And everyone else would keep the market alive with their whole usd/eth/Ltc...
It's impossible to not take all you can out of the exchange if the exchange hits you with 36%. I know my trust would be a lot different if you solved your problems with btc holders without affecting me. Now it looks like you are using my money to cover your incompetence.
I believe socializing the loss is a half solution because it will just bring a slow motion death. No one will be depositing. Everyone will rush to withdraw making everyone loose even more money. Specially usd holders with no usd bank account while trading isn't enabled. Think about it, you're landlocking too many serious good old folks in your game. this is extremely unfair. It seems you're just bringing in more people to the fight when you don't pay the 36% back because no one will ever again deposit like in the old days.
Also I still haven't seen a solid plan regarding the tokens...
How long are we gonna be left out in the dark? I want verifiable data regarding the hack and which LE is involved. It has been a week.

could you clarify if balances other than BTC will be affected? thanks

Is it possible this is just FUD from people wanting to see BFX dead? It seems many "unaffected" parties keep pushing the bankruptcy angle...
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:41:21
Yes, maybe they sold too early and need some FUD out there
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:11:02
I hope you're wrong, but it starts feeling like Stockholm syndrome. Anyway, who knows about Hong Kong and LE there that could deal with this?
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:07:31
These tokens are worthless unless they're backed by BFX's weekly/monthly fees or some guaranteed buy back.
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:23:12
were you holding btc?
I'm not arguing for bankruptcy in any way. However, The social loss should be between btc holders. No one will stay there if they're hit with 36%. You need a profiting exchange to cover the loss. Otherwise everyone pays but the faulty BFX

BFX has been surviving major blows like a real finex. To be honest, this whole NY story seems super fishy. It seems someone is afraid of a bull stampede. Regarding the dirty book entries, I can't stop remembering [The Spider's Web]( Funny how the banker city is complaining about something they practically feed from. Lets see how this whole mess gets sorted.
