1. As in BitPay? That would fix the problem and mean no extra bitcoin accounting. But it doesn't answer the comment's question, just gives a way around it. Should bitcoin always have a middle man? If that's the design, I guess I misunderstood.
2. That's not really a whole new market. If one burger place adds extra pickles and wins a few pickle-lovers, it's the same pool of customers.
The tone is anti-bitcoin. It's true that few places take bitcoin and more are wanted badly. People just need to be informed.

Thanks for the reply. Here's what I understand. Accountants must prepare for the drops in bitcoin price before they happen. They create "allowance for returns", "allowance for warranty" and "allowance for bad credit" when they sell items, and try guess how much is needed. If you expect to sell $100,000 in widgets and 10% to be defective, you record negative ($10,000) before you sell anything. So for $100,000 in expected Bitcoin revenue and 50% volatility, you first start with negative ($50,000). 50% obviously seems too high, to me.


The article didn't give the impression it was "genuine involvement", I think. Here:


The comment says there's an award for "pandering" to bitcoin. Recently a space website added bitcoin donation and made $100 from 1 person after he posted it here. His regular readers didn't donate, just us rewarding his choice. This example of many lends weight to the interpretation, in my opinion.
The [actual, real damage of Bitcoin]( should not be whitewashed. If those who follow the advice are hurt by Bitcoin, is it irresponsible if it was written to get press and cajole coins from millionaires?
