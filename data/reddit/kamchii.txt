"Should" lower fees based off various other factors becoming true first, which isn't the case currently. Lightning for example is currently still a pipe dream, and only works in a very centralized way with a small number of users. Short story, it will be a long time until something like Lightning is usable.  
You can see the current backlog of waiting transactions and the fees they're paying (in satoshis/byte, with an average transaction taking 250bytes) [here]( Every drop at the top of the graphs is a block being found and taking a few of the highest-fee transactions with it. If you zoom out to 3 months you can see the backlog for BTC has been progressively getting worse, so there's no end in sight currently to the rising fees.

I think this is one of the main points of contention: whether all the transactions currently piling up (or will in the future if growth continues) are actually spam or are legitimate and simply being priced out due to the fee market. Sure, the fees are still small and acceptable for many people, but as fees rise in cost it also eliminates more use cases. At .0001 per transfer, someone from the Democratic Republic of Congo, making one transfer per day, would cost them 3.4% of their monthly income. If fees rose to .0005 (~22c USD) they would then be up to 18.7% of their monthly income.
At this point the argument turns into 'Bitcoin shouldn't be used by those 75 million people anyways. Every coffee purchase shouldn't be on the main chain', but this was the idea many people were invisioning when first getting involved with Bitcoin. Now the line seems drawn, and the rift is growing as opinions clash on what Bitcoin should evolve into in the long-term.  
The baffling thing to me is that the vast majority of both sides seem to agree the block size will increase, it's just a matter of when. Even the Lightning Network will require much larger blocks than 2MB to function.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:45:06
IMO the one item that could be used as an argument against a block size increase is the increased bandwidth and time required to relay the block across the network which is a very real, direct effect of increasing the block size.  
However, I haven't seen any evidence to sway me that going above 1MB would be catastrophic to the network. Some areas that only have a very slow connection may be unable to run a node, but requiring the entire network to cater themselves to the weakest link, limiting growth, seems counter-productive.
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:42:41
In the future 8GB blocks could be a possibility since we don't know what the future will actually end up looking like. The internet-connected device of the future may use 8GB in a split second just to handshake with a server. Insane example, but you can't say with definite certainty that it won't happen. The internet speeds of today would seem mindbogglingly fast to those in the even recent past. Hell, the internet speed that already exist in some parts of the world seem stupidly faster compared to what other parts have.

If the majority of the network forks those left behind will suffer from a lack of adoption, and while it's possible the chain could continue (possibly requiring their own fork to lower their difficulty) those who stayed would be willing to suffer financial losses due to it. Those who opt for the majority chain would also likely sell/use their coins on the minor chain, additionally effecting the price - not a killer, just more financial loss for those invested in it as the supply of coins on the market increases.  
If the market wants additional capacity it will go to where it can get it. It doesn't matter whether that's Bitcoin or &lt;insert crypto here&gt;. If the market is happy with the available capacity they will have even with a block size reduction, then they will support it through their actions of adopting it.

Nope, just Bitcoin isn't currently evolving into something that some of the community expected it to be - an p2p value transfer system open to everyone and with eventual widespread adoption so fees to use the system don't exclude valid users or use cases.  
It's inevitable that either Bitcoin grows into that, or many users jump ship to a coin that will.
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:45:32
Still usable, but the higher the fee the less adoption there will be. If you're only interested in Bitcoin evolving into a high-level settlement layer then that's fine, but for the farmer in a 3rd-world country who can't afford a $0.20 USD fee on every transaction that's a deal breaker.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:03:03
Yep, xtreme thinblocks as advertised will have a big benefit in reducing the amount of data required to be sent across the network, which is never bad. I don't think it effects how many transactions can be put into a block however, it just changes how the details of a past block is communicated between peers in a much more efficient way. I don't have a full grasp on it yet so can be totally wrong, welcome any corrections :) 
2mb blocks will definitely fill up if Bitcoin continues to grow at a similar pace, but it allows that growth to continue for a bit while more developments, like segwit, are discovered and added. The alternative is for the popular, low-fee, everyone-welcome nightclub to hire bouncers that only lets in a trickle of people while charging a high entry fee.  
Plus, if it's proven that small blocks are better, or advances are made that make small blocks more than enough, it would be in the networks best interest to just hardfork back to a smaller block size.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:16:54

Say the world is that 1million population city. At first only the people within a few city blocks know about it and give it a try. It gets more popular and a few more city blocks worth of people give it a shot. After some time you've reached your capacity and the lines are starting to form, but in terms of total city blocks actually aware of and visiting you're restaurant you're still at a very small number, say 1%.  
You decide to focus on your single restaurant, perfecting the menu and recipes to perfection before then focusing on expanding. Wait times get longer and you can afford to increase your prices because of an increased demand. You still continue to grow in popularity a bit, but other people have already started to take notice. They take your current business plan and modify it a bit. They open dozens, then hundreds of restaurants across the city, getting extremely popular with the other 99% of people you couldn't accommodate. Some of your existing customers, fed up with inconvenience and high prices go to the competition. You still exist in this state, but have become the small-fish that only serves a niche.  
The miners and devs may be reaping the rewards currently, but you would think they would be better off in the long-run with mass adoption.

SegWit and Lightning are a temporary fix too, assuming Bitcoin keeps growing. The Lightning whitepaper itself says it requires 133MB blocks to allow 7 billion people to setup two payment channels a year, which allow unlimited transactions within the channel.  
Any change made today, whether it's increasing block size to 2MB, 20MB, or waiting for Segwit and lightning - future changes will have to be made. Increasing the block size looks like one that **will** change, it's just a matter of when.

I'm all for optimizations, but the entire argument for on-chain scaling has been for the base block size to increase in order to foster increased user growth while the miners are still being subsidized for another 123 years. Rather than entertaining this idea, which I believe is what many early bitcoiners 'signed up for', Core has decided to label a growing number of use cases as spam, driving out entire populations/countries from being able to use Bitcoin due to the rapidly rising fees, which we have all seen coming from a long, long ways away - hence the growing anti-Core crowd this past year.  
While some core devs are open to a block size increase, the facts are that one has not been developed, entertained, or even fully allowed to be fairly discussed in the big public areas (this being one of them) in the years this debate has been going on for.
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:12:00
Because the block size doesn't increase. Transactions that can fit into the still-small-block does increase, as long as there's adoption.

The community has grown larger and louder about onchain scaling and has tried compromising repeatedly. 20MB, 8MB, 4MB, 2MB. Lightning itself requires massive onchain scaling before it will be of any mass public use, as detailed in its whitepaper. The blocksize debate should be a non-issue, yet Core remains steadfast that onchain scaling is the enemy.  
The entire reason BU exists is because of Cores refusal to compromise.

The alternative to not forking was to allow new code/rules into the protocol that many users don't want included. Even though it's an optional feature it will impact everyone using the chain. This is unacceptable to many people - hence the preemptive BCH split.  


I would argue that much of the market is too blind to the technical details to pick a side and just wants their transactions to work. For example, the recent MSNBC report that explains how Bitcoin just released a dividend called Bitcoin Cash...  
I do agree the NYA agreement should be scrapped, however. Let the 50% of miners who were signalling for big blocks previously come to BCH. :)

If you want Bitcoin to be a settlement-only layer for a tiny fraction of privileged people then yes, Lightning with 1MB blocks would be fine. If this comes to pass then I'll concede defeat and move to an altcoin.
If you want 7 billion people to setup a maximum of two Lightning channels a year then Lightning requires 133MB blocks.
@_date: 2019-08-31 23:23:12
Depends on the tx type and block usage.
Native tx (non-segwit) with no tx backlog (constant full blocks) they would be the same.
Native tx on BCH and segwit tx on BTC with no backlog would be cheaper fees for the BTC-segwit tx since it's designed with a built-in fee discount. BTC isn't designed around having non-full blocks, however, so this is an undesirable state for BTC.
If any scenario the chain that hits its blocksize limit first (full blocks) will have more expensive fees than the other. In this case 1MB BTC (\~1.4MB with theoretical all-segwit tx) vs 32MB BCH.
@_date: 2019-08-31 23:17:36
Incorrect. Native tx are the same between both. Segwit tx are actually slightly larger than native tx.
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:54:03
I would prefer individual fees go down drastically so that advertising Bitcoin as ~~free~~/~~tiny~~/low-fee transactions for the average person isn't a lie anymore. This could be made up by the increased amount of transactions (adoption), but this view is contrarian to Bitcoin as a settlement-only layer where we must keep the peasantry off our blockchain...
Miners who aren't profitable will drop off the network and self-balance like they already do today. The coinbase reward is also likely the only reward most miners factor in - if fees suddenly disappeared bitcoin wouldn't grind to a halt. If mining at a loss becomes standard this also becomes a moot point.
It's also the users that make the network valuable. A cryptographically secure network that nobody uses is worthless - see altcoins. 
A cryptographically secure and popular network like bitcoin's also isn't unique - see market share.
@_date: 2019-08-31 23:16:26
Expecting the majority of the population to buy $10 worth of BTC and lose 5-25% to fees  for each tx (on a good day - much more with more usage) is the sad business model. It's economic suicide doomed to failure to be routed around by competitors.
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:20:27
If 1 bitcoin in 19 years = 12k USD then it would be the same value as what miners receive today for a block. If you believe bitcoin will be less than 12k in 19 years then your argument may be valid - but making decisions for that far into the future based off our current understanding is (heh) short-sighted.  
Just as one example: there's a chance mining will switch back over to a more decentralized setup (peoples homes) as the ASIC manufacturing process stops making giant leaps and bounds in efficiency, meaning current/future miners will have a longer useful life rather than be replaced every few months to remain competitive. Miners could also be integrated into other appliances (water tanks, etc) - I'm still running an S3 at a heavy loss since it's just being a space heater.

The payment channel is created and broadcast on the global ledger first, so both the sender and receiver (lightning channel operator) can a) both agree to spend part of the 1btc or b) individually decide to close the channel, which results in the last agreed-upon transaction to be broadcast onto the global chain, and the any remainder back under control of the sender... i think. :)

The government will print the new pink $10 bills twice as fast as they used to print the green ones, essentially doubling the market, so a pink $10 bill will only really be worth $5.

Assuming that costs will suddenly raise astronomically assumes quite a few things about what happens in the next century. It's also possible that with growing adoption (users+price) the aggregate fees will naturally replace the block subsidy over time.  
Putting the whole settlement-layer-only vs VISA-destroyer viewpoints aside, both sides agree the blocksize has to and will increase. The Lightning whitepaper says it requires blocks around 140MB. The fact we're having such massive issues over what should essentially be a hard fork test is showing Bitcoins weakness.

In addition to deadwavelength's reply, Bitcoin Cash forked before SegWit became active because 1) some of the community believed SegWit was the wrong way to scale and 2) once SegWit is active you cannot remove it without causing a mess (potential coin loss) due to the way SegWit changed transaction signatures.

Yes, lucked out and still very in the green currently too, but I'm a long-term hodler which is good because I have a bad habit of buying at the tops (~250, ~1000) but even those are profits now :)  
The fork definitely has the news headlines, but todays news isn't what decides the winner long-term. Actual use-cases and adoption are. Even if Bitcoin forks into 3 chains in November (S2X, Today's chain, Core's hardforked chain) I still believe BCH will win out by onboaring more users over time.  Thanks to EDA, as flawed as it is, there can be 100 chains competing for hash power and it will still survive.  


Yet no arguments 


Again, SegWit is not required to fix malleability. This means BCH will have its own malleability fix which is being discussed for the next hardfork. Considering Lightning will take ~1.5yrs to deploy I think it's safe to say that the moment it comes out BCH will be able to take advantage of it the same way as BTC will from the start.

The old Bitcoin had the transaction signatures moved to another part of the block and subsequently able to be pruned, plus opening up potential hardfork attacks that permit coins to be automatically stolen? The old Bitcoin gives some transactions a heavy discount to incentivize their use? The old Bitcoin makes some nodes more equal than others, making some nodes unable to verify transactions?   
The EDA is a minor change compared to SegWit. EDA is something that would benefit the current BTC chain, just in a better form. Proof: see the Ethereum/Classic hardfork and how much better they handled it than us.  
Users are keeping BCH afloat just like every other crypto, not conspiracies.  
You're dead-set in your beliefs and I in mine, unless I see evidence to the contrary. This is why we are no longer the same community, and why I've wanted a community split for a few years now. The Bitcoin I originally joined in 2011 is alive and well, just not here.

BTC chain would have died long ago if it suddenly went down to the hash power BCH did. That looks like a vulnerability of BTC that remains.  
If you don't approve of Chinese miners taking advantage of mining profits just like everyone else is incentivized to (yes, including the game theory in the whitepaper) then a) compete with them b) wait until mining hardware has a longer shelf-life so they become common for everyday people to use c) change your PoW algorithm to something naturally more decentralized, like GPU cards.

Lightning requires 133MB blocks to allow 6 billion people to each open/close a channel once per year. One channel. Each. Maximum. On-chain scaling (i.e. blocks larger than a floppy disk) is inevitable and unavoidable, full stop. No amount of citing the efficiency of off-chain vs on-chain scaling matters when, if you expect Bitcoin to be more than a plaything for a relatively tiny amount of people on the planet, they all require the ability to do timely, efficient, and cheap on-chain transactions.
Core's refusal to compromise **is** the reason the community has fractured - the very reason Bitcoin Cash and soon S2X exist. Myself and likely most of the Bitcoin Cash community would have accepted a 2MB hardfork over the past 2 years and been satisfied as it would have met user and business needs  (i.e. the very people that give Bitcoin a value in the first place) at least for the short-term.  
Here's the thing. Other coins have much better features than Bitcoin already. Instant transactions: check. Actual privacy: check. On-chain scaling: check. Low fees: check. What does Bitcoin have going for it? Network effect. Everyone knows about it. That's it. The thing is, once people get familiar with crypto, they're going to get familiar with those other coins too. If Bitcoin can't compete with them it will slowly wither and die to the competition.   
Lightning isn't some holy artifact that will solve everything and keep Bitcoin king. If Lightning does provide a massive network throughput increase it doesn't matter - because Bitcoin's competition will also have it. If anyone today wants Bitcoin to be the King of Crypto, they should support it in crushing the competition. How? Scaling and features. Make there no point to use another chain. Don't force me to buy Ethereum with my fiat so I can do transactions between exchanges way, way cheaper than Bitcoin offers.  
I'm just ranting now. My views fall on deaf ears over here anyways. We're the same community reduced to competing with each other. Let the best chain win. :)

100% is nothing compared to what many other coins have done over the time Bitcoin has remained gridlocked due to the scaling debate. I'm diversified, but my holdings assigned to the Bitcoin ecosystem will stay where they are on morals/philosophy grounds - the same reason why I got into Bitcoin. :)  
If on-chain scaling goes to zero I can live with that financially, but I sincerely doubt it will - it doesn't make sense why it would.

The EDA does need to be updated and will be, but it's allowing the chain to survive so it's fulfilling its intended purpose. BTC relying only on the 2016-block difficulty adjustment is a weakness of the protocol without even considering BCH. Just look at how poorly BTC has handled the loss of hashrate vs mempool size, then compare it to the Ethereum/Classic hardfork.  


5 different clients with interest growing steadily  


SegWit is not required for a malleability fix. Lightning, when/if it launches, will work on BCH.


All ad hominem attacks that are irrelevant to BCH. There is no glorious leader or official representative that speaks for the entire community, just like how Core or english-speaking Twitter users do not represent the entire planet.  


True, for now. Looking at the current situations numbers and claiming superiority is the same thing Western Union did against Bitcoin years ago.  


BCH was created by Core for refusing to compromise for years. As a result a decent chunk of the community was forced to abandon Core and continue building the original Bitcoin vision. Multiple miners and companies agree with that vision.


Should we try to ban all new miners under 14nm as well? They're a performance increase as well.  


Transactions on-chain are a feature of BCH that the users who use it want, there is no 'at expense of' for them. The alternative is Core's vision of high fees for each on-chain transaction which immediately prevents a large chunk of the planet from participating in Bitcoin. This is fine according to Core, though. I don't see how miners mining a little more efficiently has any impact on developers or 'progress'.  


It seems to me it's more like Core who are stroking their egos by wanting to remain in control. At first they agreed multiple times the base block size needed to increase, but only if it increased by smaller amounts than what the community was discussing. Then Core says if miners keep them in power the base block size will increase to 2MB, but only if there is universal consensus which they ultimately determine. Now a large chunk of the miner, business, and user community is forcing the original agreement Core didn't follow through on and they respond by pre-emptively blocking S2X nodes and ensuring a fork happens.  
It sounds more like Core is going to be 'kicked off the stage' at this point, and Bitcoin will be fractured into 3 (4?) different forks. How's that Core leadership working out for you?

The point was to activate segwit and a 2MB block increase. As long as those two things are done the agreement is upheld.

51% attack won't stop a network from working, just cause a reorg or allow the attacker to attempt a double-spend (although less than 51% of really needed for that) - the same as BTC is vulnerable to.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:23:06
Funny that the 'blatant scam coin' is more similar to the Bitcoin of old than BTC currently is.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:27:13
It's impossible to say who the minority is since we can't know the numbers for the entire planet. I would say it's safe to say that the majority of users have no idea about BCH vs BTC and just want their transactions to work when they use it. This also means they went along with the BTC chain through sheer ignorance - very likely the same thing that will happen when S2X becomes the dominant chain here.  
Oh, Ethereum also does more transactions that BTC does. I guess that makes BTC irrelevant too?

As long as your network isn't congested, which is how it's designed to be.

A direct blocksize increase is more bandwidth-efficient and provides a higher number of transactions per block than a block using 100% SegWit transactions - of which is unlikely, as regular Bitcoin transactions are still allowed on a SegWit chain. Each regular transaction reduces the number of SegWit-transactions that can be included in a block. This is not an opinion - the numbers support it.  
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:20:24
Because nobody knows which chain will win in the long run as there is no way to get the opinion of the entire market until both options exist for a period of time.  
I myself will hold both for now, but the new money I'm putting in will only be heading to the Bitcoin with the features I want: BCC. This community needs to split.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:33:00
I'm afraid I'm not mistaken. The Litecoin situation is not a proof against the attack I mentioned.  
It's currently a fact that a group of colluding miners can attempt to condition the network to begin ignoring the witness data by making that data less profitable to mine/verify. This attack does assume that miners are profit-seeking and not altruistic, which I believe is a perfectly good assumption and is how Bitcoin pre-SegWit was designed.  
SegWit enables the above attack. IF it happened it would be impossible to prove it, your SegWit coins would simply be transferred to another address without any signatures to prove it. Once the attack was detected the network value would implode as nobody would trust the network any longer, so whichever miner(s) succeed in this would cash out immediately. This gives all the miners a trigger, and they all get to wonder if the other guys are going to pull it first. That's not what Bitcoin was originally designed as.

Its also not in BCH anymore and was replaced with something much better than the original DAA
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:21:45
The lack of critical thinking is astonishing.  
Watch [this]( if you're even vaguely interested in contributing to the discussion regarding this attack. It gives a good overview.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:05:19
Haven't really kept tabs, but viabtc.com has a futures exchange for BCC now, and QuadrigaCX has noted they will at the least allow users to transfer their BCC coins once they exist.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:25:04
Splitting is a feature of Bitcoin and should be embraced. If there is a group large enough to cause a split, then the original implementation was failing to provide a feature/service to that community.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:06:05
Doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:41:16
Sure!  
When I joined Bitcoin [this]( was the attitude the entire community supported. The idea was that everyone was going to use Bitcoin, including the incredibly poor people of the world where $0.10usd is a big deal. As more people got involved with Bitcoin the higher its value would get due to the increased demand and use-cases, which would feed back into Bitcoin's network-effect. Bitcoin is more valuable and desirable to people when their street has 50 businesses accepting it versus the same street with only 5 businesses accepting it. This means onboarding more users provides a direct increase in the value of Bitcoin.  
I support a direct blocksize increase for multiple reasons. However, this shouldn't be an issue to begin with. It's not a matter of if or when; the blocksize **has** to increase in order for Bitcoin to even begin scaling for the original use-case of worldwide adoption. The entire reason the 1MB limit was put in place was to prevent malicious transactions (tiny amounts to/from the same addresses for no other purpose than creating transactions) from creating gigantic blocks. At the time those gigantic blocks cost the spammers cents to create since Bitcoin was mostly worthless then. Thanks to the increased value of the network, through adoption, those people attempting the same thing today with no block limit would go bankrupt extremely quickly. Even the Lightning whitepaper reported it required 133MB blocks in order for 7billion people to open and close one payment channel each per year.  
The other side of the coin is that I don't want SegWit. It opens up an attack vector on my finances that doesn't exist pre-SegWit. It provides an incentive for miners to collude and steal SegWit-coins with no tracability by conditioning the network to ignore the witness data in exchange for higher mining profits. [Peter Rizun's talk]( goes over it well. Is it likely to happen? Maybe not. Am I okay with my finances only 'maybe' being stolen? No. Even if I did want the features SegWit provides I would prefer to have them as a clean hardfork so all nodes are on the same page rather than making some nodes see a 'bigger' picture than the others.  
Many in this sub now believe Bitcoin needs to be a settlement layer, and full blocks and a fee-market are required for a healthy network. I fundamentally disagree.  
Edit: Oh, and the argument that increasing the block size will make the network more centralized by preventing people from running nodes due to increased bandwidth: it's not a problem. Yes some nodes will get knocked off, but those that will get knocked off are a) running extremely limited/old hardware or b) using extremely slow/outdated internet connections. A global financial system shouldn't limit itself to sub-dialup speeds (fun fact: 56k modem does 4MB/10mins).  
Cornell did [a study]( a year ago that showed 90% of the Bitcoin nodes at the time would support a 4MB blocksize. Since then some substantial improvements have been made in Bitcoin's bandwidth efficiency, so that recommendation is already obsolete.

Apparently I'm not getting through to you, so will just leave you with [this]( and stop trying. You may keep your head in the sand if you wish.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:15:32
The BCC fork shouldn't need to alter their chain just because the BTC chain alters their protocol which permits a way for their coins to be stolen.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:42:14
SegWit does introduce a reason for miners to collude and steal coins if they are profit-seekers.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:17:12
Your response shows that you don't understand the attack method described in the video. I suggest watching it again. No amount of hating me/my opinion will change the fact that you are wrong about this attack and that it does exist. 
Edit: woops, that was the other one I linked  the video to. [Here](
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:08:14
Also doesn't matter. If Bitcoin (regardless of which implementation 'wins') does become a widely-adopted currency then its current market-cap is infinitesimally tiny to what it will become.
