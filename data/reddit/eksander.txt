Well, for starters, my comment is targeting students and young people. When people say "Dont put all your savings in crypto" That is a very general thing to say. European teens will be absolutely fine putting all their savings in there, even if they are not that much.
American teens, no, because of high tuition, perhaps risk due to shitty health system, the ridiculously high housing costs, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:28:22
Not everyone is american, needs money, has debts or a family. I can live perfectly well with 300 a month from a part time gig as a student and still have all my life savings, scholarship funds, money I've accumulated invested in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:32:04
"Don't invest more than you're willing to lose", this is a great thing to say, fits all scenarios.
"Don't invest all your fiat", if the reason is don't do it so that you can buy the dip, sure. If the reason is because you need safety, then I don't agree. But this is true mostly for European students. All my money is still relatively a very low amount, and I can comfortably afford to lose. I never even had a real job, so I technically shouldn't even have money. However here I am with my 2btcs
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:06:50
I get paid minimum wage for studying and getting good grades, which I never needed to use for the last 4 years so I hodled those euros. I did some other part times jobs, tutoring and also subleased a student place for income. Instead of hodling euros, I am now proudly hodling 2 bitcoins.
EDIT: I know its not alot, but it's just to make a point: "Dont put all your money into crypto" doesnt always hold. I have my life set up in a way which I can afford to do so. Another perfect example is Sunny decree on youtube. He claims all his money is crypto
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:28:12
No, university is free because I volunteered as fireman and they cover it, I got a grant for housing so thats covered, a part time gig which covers my food and other needs, and I invested all my 20k euros which I had saved up from other jobs and investments into crypto because otherwise it'll be sitting in my bank. I don't buy what I don't need, best way to make money is not spend it
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:28
Exactly what I meant. "All your life savings" is a very general thing people say. For me I invested all because I can afford to lose it since I am under 25 and only have to care about myself and I'll be fine with a low income for now.

We were never in a bear market. Untill we drop below 5800usd this is a correction within a bullrun. It can go both ways still at this point

I didn't read the full article, but glimpsed it.
It says that USDT is backed by USD after it was audited in June 2018. Of course, we can tin foil hat it and say that the auditor has questionable motives, but I decided to believe it. 
These 100M new tethers have not been audited yet, and maybe they only audit these 100M USDT once they have generated enough profit in USD by manipulating the market which seems to be the likely scenario.

Im quoting Alessio Rastani there, and I agree. A bear market is what happened to gold and bitcoin in 2014. If btc drops below 5800, goes to 4kish then we are entering bear market territory in my opinion (and Alessios). If after this descending triangle, it pushes out back to 20k how was this a bear market?

@_date: 2018-09-04 10:50:42
Look, I did. And I still don't think this is in bear market territory. Investopedia says a commonly acepted value for a bearmarket is 20% thus encouraing selling. 20% in crypto occurs in hours span and does not encourage selling. We've had 50% drops in a single day and return to normal in the next days.
Currently we are at 70% drop. In the past there has been 90-95% corrections in price. If bitcoin bounces back from only a 70% correction - was it ever really a bearmarket? Or just a correction promoting the buying of more bitcoin for a continued rally?

I'm no economics expert, but I still don't believe that is correct. Inflation is not related to peoples opinion, it is maths. 1usd=1usd only if you time freeze it, but I was comparing USD(1980) to USD (2018). 
Forget the USD value of bitcoin, in 2140 it could be 1billion, doesnt matter. The fact is that
1BTC(2140)/1BTC(2018) = 17M/21M
It will be worth more in reality, but thats not because of inflation, thats because of demand which cannot be easily modeled. The inflation will still be hidden within the final USD evaluation in 2140

But he's been doing it for over 6 years he claims, and seems be be sucessfull with arbitrage trading. He was locking in profits. No idea why he wouldn't use an exchange. I asked for a small discount on the asking price and ended up at exactly 20% off current exchange rate.

*Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation.* from wikipedia.
I wouldn't count bitcoin on that definition. It has use cases and thus an intrinsic value, even if it doesn't reflect current value. Like gold, it can be used for jewelary but thats not the reason for its price currently.
*Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity.* from investopedia
Bitcoin is not a physical commodity, but it has everything to be classified as a digital commodity. I think these definitions will adapt to changing technology.

In general you want BTC/Fiat during dips and diversify at bottom of dips. Alts always pump back up faster after dips.

Yeah, I just swing from btc to alts during dips and fully on btc when things are starting to look sketchy/overextended.

I honestly think this is one of the most bullish news I've heard. All 10-15 YO kids these days watch twitch, possibly influenced by their older brothers (Me, and many others here)
They are the generation to be targeted, the digital generation Z. If they start using it for all internet based payments and even *some* real life scenarios, bitcoin will have a guaranteed spot in this world, regardless of what regulations or governments say.
Not to mention Twitch is owned by amazon. Its a huge step in making Btc the currency of the internet. It will only be a real world currency, after it establishes itself as a internet currency, its native domain.

Some content deserves payment, sure. But how can we know what is deserving and what is not beforehand? You dont. You become expected to pay a couple thousand sats and try it. And if you dont like it, well its only a couple cents. Then you have to do it again. And again.

It absolutely can, since the general public has lost interest and theres is very low volume. If a whale wants it, it will happen. But the underlying network of people, hashrate and value of the network has grown much more since last time we were at 1k so even if it dips to 1k, the recovery will be much faster because that is incredibly cheap, and people know it.
Eventually, it will bottom out and the price will rise steadily following an exponential trendline similar to the past ones, and one day, another major trigger and FOMO will cause another crazy bullrun. This is not TA, I am not saying it will not fall below the yellow line. I am saying that any price near the yellow line is  a theoretical good buy price, but always do dollar cost average and dont go all in.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:54:41
All of that is doable in multiple layers, not on the main chain... I will try one last time to make my point. 
Bitcoin is not about improving payment systems. It is about providing an alternative to having all your currency as a decaying fiat number displayed on the ATM screen, which is not backed by any real life asset other than the promise that the bank will always be liquid. News flash, they are not (fractional reserves). They go bankrupt and fuck us in the ass.
Bitcoin allows for everything that a bank does, with varying degrees of decentralization to allow for scalibility, while having as a native currency bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and cannot ever be generated under "fractional reserves" or lose value to to printing more.
I'm done with this conversation
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:45:36


How is it different? Enlighten me then, or provide me a source so I can learn. 


I dont care, I've been selling every month since january. Got my cash stack ready for after this. Its a bubble, price was miles away from real adoption curve.


I didnt say government would adopt Bitcoin, maybe I should have worded differently. What I really meant was a wallet that is acknowledged as a bank, meaning that have the legal responsability to hold our Bitcoin and keep it always availiable.  If I want, I can use my keys. If I feel safer, I can use such a wallet.... It is an important step, especially for older people etc.
And finally, YES YES Debt should never be incentivized! It can existe, sure, but it shouldn't be a significant part of someones life model. The cycle must be broken, expensive house -&gt; loan -&gt; overbid -&gt; more expensive house. In the meanwhile, bankers pocket the interest, and eventually it all crashes down. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:45:08


That sentence I said summarizes everything you just said. They were selling subprime loans or mortgages that were being speculated on by everyone and their mother, whereas the underlying asset was shit.
Now we have student loans, mortage, car, the entire fucking country while were at it ( 21 Trillion amirite). Same shit. It will continue happening every single time as long as the banks have this monopoly. There is no competition to the banking system, they control the currency flow and the government is not going to protect forever. Gradually, those strict rules get laid back, lobbyist do their moves, bad politicians take power...
Bitcoin, for me, is a tool to live a happy and comfortable live away from all this. I admit, I need a "bank". I have poor organizational skills and I will lose my seeds. But that "bank" will not be holding fiat and pocketing the interests on my money while giving me crumbs. It will be a trusted wallet client, regulated by the government.

@_date: 2018-11-20 17:37:58
It was greatly due to fractional reserve banking and selling subprimes loans. Banks can literally give away fiat, upon request of some average Joe. Sure, regulation can help... But regulations come and go in cycles... The situation right now is actually worse than 2008, and noone is talking about it because "we have learned our lesson". Anyway, I don't wanna go there because that would be tinfoil.
If you use Bitcoin, you don't need any of that crap, and if you have to take a loan it will be transparent and laid out in a smart contract (Theres a project for bitcoin smartcontracts now, otherwise Ethereum) which does not allow banks to literally "Print" 10k out of nowhere and give it to someone, knowing that in the end, they cannot afford it...

The real value, inherent value of bitcoin is related to how many people know about it, how many people learn the technology, learn how to use it, buy it, tell their friends, mine it etc. That is social and grows exponentially, there is no ponzi scheme because it is not a zero sum game, there is a product/platform being created that allows to hedge against fiat, performs purchases, international transfers, etc. 
After a bull cycle finishes, we converge back to this exponential trend and it repeats.

Why would I give people what they are looking for, or a strategy for that matter? I was just reminding people that adoption, network growth and value tend to grow exponentially, and that only now we are stepping back into an healthy historic exponential law.

I though I was clear, having bitcoin wallet is the equivalent to having a bank account. Using the LN for payments is the equivalent to using a wireless chip on your debit card.
You don't do a bank transfer everytime you buy coffee, the same way you won't use the mainnet... You use a second layer solution, less safe and more scalable, built into it.
Brexit disaster? Fuck yeah its because of Brexit, but it is not the fault of most the people! It is poor government administration, and for their whims and benefits, the poor always lose. Bitcoin can protect us all from this, one day it will be the US and other European countries. Authoritarianism is rising everywhere, and bad decisions are bound to be made.
You have have a viable currency, fixed supply, independent of government action throughtout your entire lifespan. The money in your pocket, which you can buy coffee with, will be worth multiple times more in the future. You seriously don't see how amazing that is?
In the currency system, you are obligated to play THEIR game. You either WORK your entire life, or you throw it all into an overvalued stock market because interest rates are so low, its not worth having your wealth in the bank. It is rigged so that the poor invest must invested in stocks (current situation, not always).
We have an alternative presented to us now, in the form of Bitcoin. You can preserve your wealth (I'm not even talking about moon). You can simply preserve your wealth and still use it to buy coffee on a daily basis.

I believe a long term exponential regression. There is a reason it is the model used for population growth in ecosystems, decay in atoms and on and on. It is the best model you can get for bitcoin user base adoption, bitcoin hashrate growth and therefore the real value of the network, not its speculative value.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:46:43
10years of price data and hash power growth does not show to a certain degree of certainty that it does track an exponential trend ? The whole point of my post, is to simply show that the past 10 years have tracked an exponential growth rate, as is typical in such networks/systems.
Thats science: This model has been validated over 10 years of history, and we can assume with an increasing degree of certainty that will continue to do so, until it is falsified and then we look for a new model.
The bullruns are phenomena dominated by hype, excitment, greed, manipulation, media and are very artificial. The \*GENERAL\* growth trendline, is not. 
  
One major assumption here is that Bitcoin is not yet at its full market cap, because then prices begins to settle down and stabilizes. Do you think bitcoin is at its full potential? With only like 1% people owning some? No LN? With an upcoming halvening? With no institutional platforms for the common folk? Only 200B market cap? NOPE.
Another assumption is that there is no major system failure or worldwide ban, but Hey, I could also die tomorrow and then the linear growth of my age which has an historic record of 20+ years would also go down the drain right?  
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:59:52
Don't be greedy and keep buying the dip in 2019... A basic exponential regression places bitcoin at 10k in the end of 2019. Guess what happens in March 2020? Bitcoin halving.
10k late 2019, 100k late 2020 after the halving. Patience and dreams is all we got untill then
Also, it doesn't really matter if bottom is 3.5k, 4.5k, 2.5k... We are entering accumulation phase.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:46:16
I drew the line quite arbitrarily, exact values are on the realm of crystal balls and TA. If I move the line 1 degree then its 4000usd. Doesn't matter
I'm saying that very soon, this dip will finish and we will most likely be back on an historic exponential trend line and which is accumulation stage.
Edit: And when I say buy/sell I don't mean sell/buy all... Dollar cost average. If you have 4000USD, maybe 500 now, 500 in a month etc etc.

The dip? Nah... Itll look probably be bloody for the upcoming months, especially as hopeful hodlers get fucked in the ass by tax season, but I think we can expect this exponential line (or a similar one) to begin being tracked soon. Once we find an healthy exponential growth during an entire 6months-1year, then all we need is a major trigger, such as the bitcoin halving in March 2020.

Listen, first of all, I directly oppose libertarianism and the free market. I believe in wealth distribution, technodemocray and socialism/communism. Bitcoin has been hijacked by libertarian ideals, but its transparency and decentralization make it a fantastic tool for taxing and distributing wealth. Tools like Chainanalysis put rich people on the spotlight, and with development of technology, eventually everyone will know what bitcoin everyone else has. Look at Finland example, there is a day a year where everyones tax information is pubicly released, meaning you know how much your boss made and spent, as well as your neighbour, as well as the politicians. Thats my alignment with Bitcoin.
As for the bubble, well fuck it I'm not gonna throw away my wealth under the carpet just because I believe in the tech right? Fuck no, Ill buy it back later... Not my fault it went into a bubble.
Next, you are talking as if *suddenly* Bitcoin replaced the USD and everything went to shit, not the slow decades long adoption process I am trying to describe all along this thread. 
It doesn't fix any of that, why would it fix it? A Bitcoin based economy would have prevented it from ever happening since the prices wouldn't have been ridicoulously inflated due to capitalism. But thats an utopia, and not what we have currently.
We keep getting away from the use case I want bitcoin for: To have a viable currency, that is deflationary and whose "value" (NOT PRICE) depends on mathematics and social dynamics, not on goverments, banks, wars, Brexits, Iran deals, Bolsonaros, Trumps, Erdogans and whatever the venezuela guys name was. Am I asking too much? Why can't I have this? You can choose to go for your Proof of Military Supremacy, but for me, I am happy to have Proof of Work.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:41:47
Bitcoin is slow and cumbersome because it decentralized, censorship resistant and deflationary. If you want to do trivial daily payments, you can use another service such as the Lightning Network at the expense of some decentralization, which is absolutely fine for trivial payments + your core holdings are still in mainnet, safe and deflating. Institutions can use the Liquid Network for safe large volume transactions internationally. Kids can use it to buy shit online, just like they use their V-Bucks, Bits, and crappy videogame tokens.
Personally I am super excited, because right now, I am having a field day buying shit from [amazon.co.uk]( British pound is down to 1.10 agaisnt the euro, but it used to be 1.25 a few months ago and 1.45 2 years ago. This means that buyers from the United Kingdom actually didn't lose as much as us recently if they were holding bitcoin and not pounds. I won't even talk about Bulgary, I have a friend there shipping me stuff to I can sell here because their currency is inflating like hell. One day this will be the Euro or the USD, no doubt about it.
There is VALUE in bitcoin, and there is plenty of people that don't buy it simply because they want to make a quick buck. These crashes cleanse the market of these people. It won't drop to $1 because me, and many others, will buy it all before it drops to $1. We are convinced of its possibilities, and everyday we share our knowledge and "faith" lets put it that way to others, exponentially contributing to an ever growing network.

That doesn't ignore volatility, in fact, what you proposed makes no sense. The price is always in dollars, not bitcoins (for now). But people don't want to lose more bitcoins than they have to so when the price is low, we hodl which is bad for the business selling products. And the other way around, some smaller businesses may not be happy taking overpumped bitcoins bound to crash any second.

The problem with the current system, based on debt and inflation, is not only the cash distribution but also the cash flow. It always flows to the top, which creates bigger gaps over time.
On a deflationary economy such as the utopian bitcoin one, there may be a initial concentration of wealth but the cash flow and dynamics should be very different because you are in possesion of your own money and it keeps it's value overtime. I don't know if it would be better or worst, but I'm pretty sure it would be different

@_date: 2018-04-16 17:10:06
This is what I mean, in an inflationary economy, you must spend and invest thus creating the cash flow to the top that I was talking about. 
It does erode generational wealth, but at a much faster pace for the lower classes with acess to less resources/knowledge and time because they are led to the belief that they must work to keep up. In the other hand, the generational wealth of the richest keeps snowballing. (I'm basically describing a pyramide)

The problem is that the means, the cause, the motivator and the end goal are all the same: Money.


But ALOT less. Consumerism is a major plague, and it was introduced into society for a single purpose: to motivate people to work more, to spend more and keep the cash flow upwards strong.


Well, if people need less and what they hold is enough, perhaps they will work less and pay less thus slowy starving the boss.
Some people say: But then humans will fall to misery, with no motivation, no purpose and no reason to work. I don't think this is true. We will work less for meaningless causes, such as making corporations richer. Perhaps we wouldn't have made to the moon in the 1960s, maybe we would have made it in the 2000s. But who cares right? We still make it there. Perhaps without feeding the big industries/companies the rate of global warming and destruction of this planet is so much slower that we can actually enjoy our time here, instead of racing to leave to another planet or to fix the problem.
I diverged there lol, but the utopias we can dream about with bitcoin are endless. And probably will never happen in the real world.
