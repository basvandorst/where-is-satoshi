Circular logic at it's finest. I see the same logic used by fundamentalist Christians who insist non-believers are proving their own inherent sinful nature by the very act of questioning.

True there is a lot of greed being masked by heroism here, but come on, you don't think emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies, the blockchain and peer-to-peer networks will have a much larger place in the future?

There's a lot about emergent peer-to-peer networks, and the relatively new fields of systems theory and cybernetics that informs us a lot about sociology and behavior of humans on massive scales. I guess I can't give you many specifics though because I'm kind of an idiot.

Thanks Sean. I've been following the pics on your facebook. Keep going strong.

Nope, I just prefer to discuss things with experts and people who are involved in what the discussion is about, rather than people who just have an opinion and have no experience in what they're talking about.

Palmer! Irrelevant: Will OculusVR accept bitcoins for the consumer version of the Rift?

As has been said, get out of your bank and join a credit union. Non-profit and they won't hassle you about bitcoin.

Seriously. Sometimes I can't handle reading some of the comments from the hordes of uninformed people in other subreddits where bitcoin discussion pops up.

Oculus Rift logo?

What a grossly uninformed article. How is he ignoring the growth of bitcoins and the growth of people interested and buying bitcoins?
I tend to wonder if some of these article writers are paid to spread fear and disinformation, or if they have some other motive driving their nonsense.
