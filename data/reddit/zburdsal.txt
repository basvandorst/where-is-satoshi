Yeah, in the vice interview the founder of this said he still ate solid food occasionally for this reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:41:16
800? They sell 1000 man, come on!
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:37:10
As a counter-point to no one putting serious money into dogecoin, on cryptsy right now there is a sell order of 32 BTC of dogecoins at a single price point, and the 24 hour volume is over 2300 BTC, which really makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:49:21
Which according to the creator of this project, will only happen once or twice a week. Cool.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:48:56
Just because you lost some BTC on the faults with ferret encoding technology, don't blame BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:19:37
That would just cause those exchanges to fail after a few months, if they picked up any traction at all. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:17:49
Well that's how came to it. I'm guessing he used the threading number per core, but not sure what that means.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:24:35
The problem with gox is the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get money out of it. That's the short answer anyway. Otherwise, follow advice. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:19:57
A lot of people buy more bitcoins as they spend them.
Example: last night I bought some sheets from overstock.com due to their addition of bitcoins when the price was 843, then bought about the same amount back about two hours later when it was at like 810.

If anything, it's an inverted population map. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:53:10
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:30:05
Can confirm: Just bought some sheets. It's about the same process as buying reddit gold with bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:44:13
Well, means the email is real. Doesn't mean your account wasn't compromised.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:06:17
Can confirm, took the trash out in -8f last week in only my shorts.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:25:45
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:37:42
Plus it says the price in the picture, so there's that.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:38:49
Looking for some new sheets to buy, guess I might as well look there now.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:10:11
Hmm, I guess that does make more sense. Correction it is then!
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:48:20
It's at 195, so won't be long
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:10:39
Bitcoin paranoid managed to wake me up with all the price jumping at 5:30 am, but I only got to it as it was at 510, but I still bought .5 at that
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:22:07
If only it didn't take 7 days to buy on coinbase...
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:47:53
Pretty easy to check, the address is right there in the picture.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:09:07
Someone also bought 600 at 176, wish I was that guy right now,
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:00:40
Up to 254 on bitstamp, it could make it by today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:02:33
im selling 1/3 of mine at 250, 1/3 at 275 and all but 1 at 300, so heres hoping it'll be something like what you've said.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:36:33
Source? I'd like to hear him talk about this.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:58:18
Op used the bitstamp.net numbers as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:34:49
Well, .77% change in 9 hours, so more than $48 a year, I'll go figure out the actual value after a year. 
Hey where is an easy place to figure out the current price for a bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:32:15
I started using bitcoin paranoid about 2 weeks ago, it's the best I can find for android.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:20:32
What kind of work were you thinking of? 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:41:11
And it can give you paper cuts I hear. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:55:47
I think mean hedging, although I'm not that familiar with the term. If somehow there isn't a bubble pop then I'll buy back on after a week or two above 300, but that seems very unlikely. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:15:50
I'd like to think all of that is true, especially this not being a bubble (or as pointed out to more correctly be a correction as pointed out by but it may take a few more years for that to be entirely correct.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:35:16
Get a job as a secretary? 
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:36:34
It's definitely a bubble, though hopefully when it pops it won't pop below 180 or 190.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:06:51
Haha, his first graph shows a 5 min time period. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:31:18
Huh, it went up 5 cents in the last 9 hours. Cool. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:03:27
No I'll still believe in it, but like kind of said, I don't think it'll go much further than a few days at 300 before popping, but hey if it stays above 300 for awhile I'll buy back in and lose a bit for trying to avoid a fall.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:11:30
Haha its up to 672 the now, guess that's over. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:37:32
Really wish I was able to buy last week, but no my bank thought I should wait for a few days and see if I still want to... No it's 20$ higher a bitcoin and I can't sell when the bubble starts to pop. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:35:19
For proof see @_date: 2013-10-21 20:15:46
Too much clutter, too many colors.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:17:00
I'm dealing with it now. Seems cryptsy messed up one of my orders and now I have 40,000 ZET, and -.8 BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-11 21:22:21
So you can't send precious metals. Does this include things that contain precious metals? Like any electronics? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:16:23
604 -&gt;586 -&gt; 515 -&gt; now to 550. I'm so confused.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:26:23
hmm... I think I may join in on this...
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:38:47
You mean like everything?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:24:29
Huh, seems you were kinda right. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:39:01
He should do an ama, he'd be rich. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:28:33
I was trying to explain bitcoins to my family a few days ago and I went into the comments on one thread, where this bot was just everywhere, when I explained to them that it was people giving 5 or 10 dollars to others just for making a good point on the Internet, they all just confused. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:43:42
Yeah but like, it's Pluto, who wants that?
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:03:45
576846.72 USD from what I can tell, although I don't know more than what I've just googled.
1 bar is 27.4 pounds,  16 ounces per pound (normal ounces, not troy), $1315.8 per ounce.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:21:25
Link to what's being said?
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:30:47
Plain solid or at least monochrome, business cards are supposed to get information across not get someone's attention, if they're holding the card you already have their attention.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:16:58
Is this weird? What does everyone else in the U.S. use?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:12:58
An exchange is usually 2 days or less, brokers like coinbase are a week with buy limits. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:06:00
Where did he say this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:34:04
I think bitstamp has been around 830 for the last 2.5 days, which is what a lot of people here seem to use.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:14:53
On mtgox? Go by bitstamp.net
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:28:18
You would get more BTCs by just buying from an exchange than buying a mining contract.
@_date: 2013-06-01 02:45:16
That's a lot man, read around a bit before asking something like that. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:07:37
This usually just happens after every little drop from the influx of people trying to sell, it's back up for me now.
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:30:43
Woah the value of an internet has really come down recently.
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:07:36
So where can I buy bitcoins that are licensed in the way you say?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:15:48
Well... You trade bitcoins for other currencies to get them usually, although I guess you might be able to sell some things for them? 
Also downloading a wallet doesn't really mean much, you may want to read the getting started stuff on the sidebar.
