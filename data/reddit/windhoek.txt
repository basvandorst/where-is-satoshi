the only thing i hate on bitcointalk is that theymos is collecting tons of donations for a stupid new forum software...

lol you are worried that you dont know from which person the donations come. damn thats so sick, so far i can tell you already can only vote for parties/candidats who get a lot of company donations. the weird thing is everybody knows it but nobody seems to care.. other parties have no chance to success.  if you ask me the US have the weirdest democracy i have ever seen and when it comes to vote for presidents you only have the choice between cholera and plague

The whole economic crisis is an economic war between US and Europe.
However it is a good idea to put your money into Bitcoin (for a while). But I think Americans should do the same. Europeans Centralbank prints a lot of new money since the crisis, the FED is doing that ever since I can remember..
