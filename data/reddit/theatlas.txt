Essentially, this isn't a matter of philosophy and what we prefer but the precedent of the market: Whoever's preferences are most valued/powerful.

I see you have a strong binding to subjective morality. I accept that. You will find that we prefer similar ends. You just don't accept reality as I do. 
When the will has the means to achieve the ends, you can impact anything. That may or may not include persuasion. 
@_date: 2012-05-25 02:10:07
My point is Bitmunchies failed because very few people buy Bitcoins with additional fees just to get food with it. 
There is a cost in acquiring Bitcoins. Now, if you are a Bitcoin miner, a big investor or otherwise you may have another story and no cost at all. However, such people are a minority at the moment. 
If people had Bitcoin-paying jobs, sure, buying essentials with Bitcoins would be reasonable.

I don't see the problem. 
It seems you simply prefer forced legitimacy by a central authority. 
Traders trade at their own risk. Money talks. The money says (250 Bitcoins) this bond will pay. People have confidence in it based on the evidence available. The market agrees with my conclusions about Meni Rosenfeld and his ABSORB bonds.
Again, I see no problem. 
Additionally, money affects wherever it goes as long as it has value. Its connection to the real world is inherent.

"I don't want to give anyone the idea that this will be paid 90D [3 months] after IPO, **because that very well may not happen.**"
-- Kluge, IOU | 
This bond has a life-span of less than 3 months unless Kronos is going to spend like crazy. 
The fact is these people will profit very quickly and then buy back these bonds as soon as possible. The 90 day estimate is just for marketing purposes only. 
Remember, the fact that these bonds are being resold is only testament of the likely truth that they are betting against you making a big profit through dividends.

It wasn't true margin trading. Bitcoinica was just a bucket shop managing bets on the prices. The maximum possible wins weren't even there.  It seems Bitcoinica wasn't what Bitcoin deserves. 
As for kronos.io, I don't know if it will be actual trading. We'll see.
@_date: 2012-05-28 07:36:45
From first impression, this offering looks like it sucks.
However, if you imagine how much profit Kronos.io is going to have as a monopoly on Bitcoin margin trading, this might just be a nice deal; as long as they don't cut you short with a forced buyback within a month or two. 
**My suggestion: Buy from pre-IPO sellers (or become one) at .105 through .1139 and get a guaranteed profit. I wouldn't mess with full price. These middlemen are probably going to buyback this bond really fast.**

No, they can't. John F. Kennedy tried to give the control of our money supply back to the treasury and congress and he got his head blown off. Same thing with Harding and Lincoln.
Andrew Jackson was the only successful president to overturn a private central bank.
The Treasury is simply a printing press that makes fancy designs. The government doesn't own the money that comes out of it.
The Federal Reserve is absolutely and positively corrupt from the very fact partial audits expose unauthorized wires back to Europe in the trillions.
The shareholders of the only functional branch of The Federal Reserve (NY) are entirely private. It's all in black and white. Trace the holding companies and shareholders to the top and you get a single family in London. 
You're just buying what they want you to see. If people knew the truth about our monetary system, it would be overturned overnight.

If your idea of it serving as " a medium of exchange" is valued, then the market will account for that by making sure any price rise is gradual. 
@_date: 2012-07-15 23:18:58
The price would go up simply because of the existence of such tyranny. People will want to leave the banking system even more if the government started tightening controls like.
If anything, the goverment would be creating a monopoly for the select few that could sell Bitcoins.
In fact, I would be a happy man if the government tried to shut down the exchanges; there would be lots of money to be made.
...and a good portion of Bitcoin's value is in the black markets. Not just speculation.

Our governments are indebted to the private shareholders of central banks, the creators of fiat currency. This gives perverse incentive to have our countries default on debts so bankers can achieve more profitable control of our world.
Inevitably this will lead to more and more centralized governance and less of humanities desires met. 
For citations from the Library of Congress, I direct you to The Secrets of the Federal Reserve: 
In short, Bitcoin eliminates the need for governments and individuals to indebt themselves to the creators of a money supply. 
This leads to less inflation, more money in our pockets, more savings and thus a more prosperous society.
@_date: 2012-05-28 09:14:25
On its face, what you are saying its correct but if you look deeply how The Federal Reserve operates, there are nuanced collusions that turn this whole illusion on its face. 
I would turn you to the The Federal Reserve Act itself but, if you want, give The Secrets of the Federal Reserve a shot. 
Anyways, I am so sorry somebody is downvoting you, hugolp.

You're a funny man.
The people who don't support Bitcoin for political ends will quickly ditch it when a government opposes it. They will never be loyal. They are a pillar Bitcoin can stand upon but no the only one.
We need more political people to know about it. They will be the most loyal, uncompromising supporters. There are more to be found. By turning this userbase passionate, we can attract even more people exponentially. 
I wish to see the strongest base possible. The regular users will come naturally after the grass roots uses it passionately.
