Agree. Any rally this weekend is an April Fools' rally.
1. Expecting the current sell-off to find support at approx 5900.
2. Then, a 15%-20% bounce.
3. Followed by, another sell-off leg to approx 4000.
4. Then, an approx 40% bounce.
5. Followed by, a cryptocalypse to 1000.

Personally think Bitcoin is headed towards $850 to $2500 by 2Q2019. Therefore, cannot recommend any buying of the dips since they are falling knives and dead-cat bounces. All cryptocurrencies are in a bear market, and all ALT/BTC pairs will hit zero.
Expecting an approx 15%-20% bounce once the 6000 lows are taken out. Followed by another sell-off to approx 4000. At which point, an approx 40% bounce ought to occur back to 6000. After that, welcome to cryptodystopia!

If the low of 27-MAR holds (or 7600 on Bitfinex), there is potential for an Easter rally towards approx 9500.
However, only an April's fool would believe in a continued rally much beyond:

Surprisingly bearish, even by my standards!
7600 on Bitfinex remains key between a graceful Easter, or a massacre from the bunnyman.

That's the whole point of the exercise! 
Time and price scales are removed to illustrate how the same patterns occur on very different price and timescales; i.e. fractals.

Now that's funny! :)
It does look precarious, but expecting at least one more wave higher before the collapse. Markets usually drift aimlessly higher on low volume during holiday seasons, but this doesn't appear the case at the moment. 7600 on Bitfinex is really quite the line in the sand, below that, and its welcome to cryptodystopia!

The purpose of the CSCO chart is to illustrate how price forms in fractals; and how exponential parabolic bubble curves, usually decline a Fibonacci 78.6% of value when they burst.
This happens on all time scales whether hours, days, weeks, months, years or decades. 
Here is a blind test with price and time scales removed. It illustrates how the same patterns occur on very different price and timescales.
Two charts ended in a speculator crash losing 80% in value, and one isn't done yet.
Can you tell which is Bitcoin, and which is Nasdaq, and which is a random stock called Pulte Group ?:

History has shown that once an asset class bubble bursts, it never recovers to become a bubble again —there are rarely any "second chances", if any at all.
Paradoxically, a volatile and rapid appreciation of a currency, is a failed currency. By definition, currencies are supposed to be recognized, accepted and stable mediums of exchange for goods and services —not just another speculative boom-bust asset class driven by speculative mania like art.
Cryptocurrencies can only be considered for adoption once corporations, governments and charities deem the asset class as stable. However, speculators and traders desire anything but stability and thrive on the volatility of 10% intraday price swings —the demographic here are experienced pre-millennial traders from other asset classes, whom quite frankly are careless in regards to the future of cryptocurrencies. So, the demographic 'invested' in cryptocurrencies are the millennials whom have a pseudo-understanding of cryptography and blockchain given their affinity to technology; but with a lack of trading experience and anti-establishment views, they simply adopt a unidirectional mentality, i.e. 'hodl', in the vein that prices will perpetually rocket to the moon.
Its a classic case of where the millennials know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. Real-world intrinsic value will be set by the 'whale' pre-millennials.
So who actually has any altruistic concern about the future of cryptocurrencies? Nobody. Hence, the bubble bursts. The ALT/BTC tokens are the epitome of manipulation and fraud.
Cryptocurrencies are a speculative side implementation of legitimate blockchain technology. Use of blockchain such as distributed ledgers for say the Asset Servicing areas of investment banking are genuine solutions. Once legitimate uses of blockchain are adopted as real-world applications, its then likely a second generation of cryptocurrencies may emerge as stable alternatives to fiat with greater adoption.
Quite possible that the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon lead the way with the next generation cryptocurrencies by acquiring the current players. In comparison to a mobile farm in rural China, cloud mining with say Microsoft's Azure decentralised platform with their vast, secure and robust datacentres is most technically feasible and trustworthy.
—If the costs of mining begin to outweigh, then Bitcoin could cease to exist along with the current generation of other cryptocurrencies.
—Not all speculative asset classes have survived their respective bubble bursts, especially non-tangible ones.
—Technology, algorithms, software &amp; hardware are short-cycle lifespan industries, subjected to rapid price depreciation and obsolescence. 
—If Bitcoin does survive, price volatility would have to subside for adoption, and it must begin to behave like a stable currency as opposed to boom-bust cycles akin to a speculative asset class. Therefore, its success as a currency and survival would be paradoxically tied to no further parabolic price appreciation curves. 
—Cicso, the darling of dotcom stocks, the backbone of the Internet, has yet to recover from its parabolic price collapse 20 years on; chart: 
Since inception, the price of Bitcoin and mining complexity have been been parabolically twined. 
However, since late Dec 2017, price has more than halved whilst the difficulty of mining remains increasingly complex.
Is this divergence between price/complexity sustainable economics, whether altruistic in pursuit or incentivised?
In other words, would you work harder and for longer whilst your salary decreased? Ask the Virginia coal miners.

Difficulty: 
Historically, when any asset bubble bursts, the unravelling bear market typically lasts 2 years on average (from peak price to ultimate low); and usually erases approx 90% in value (thebubblebubble.com/historic-crashes).
Applying the metrics to the cryptocurrency bubble, it would suggest Bitcoin between $850 and $2500 around 2Q2019.

Pullback to approx 8000 underway, followed by final bounce to approx 9500, and then crash to approx 4000.
