Making up numbers, assuming bitcoin was used in 1% of world transactions...
Using this: $78e12 * 0.01 bitcoin percentage of world transactions = $780e9 / 16 million bitcoin = $47000/bitcoin.  
If it was used in 10% of world GWP it would be $470000, but that's a stretch.

I bought a raspberry pi from the original dealers and never received it.  Looking forward to getting one from adafruit now.

I always thought a good way would be to hand out a block chain (piece of paper with pre filled in blocks) to every person.  Explain what a transaction is and at that point you announce you're sending money to someone in the class.  At that point you have everyone start flipping a coin, and the first person to get two heads in a row adds it with their initials to their block chain and everyone else copies the block down.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which in real terms means a way for machines to talk to coinbase.  If you were programming a point of sale system, or auction site and wanted to integrate with coinbase, you'd use the API.
