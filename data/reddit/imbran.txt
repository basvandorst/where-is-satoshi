lol? I guess $1000 doesn't mean much to you.. 
I mean I'm always open for donations if you like.

I actually work hard to make money online.. I don't get allowance, lunch money or anything. All the money I have is earned through work and losing this much is killing me. "work" does not always imply that I work with hourly wage and what not..

I can sell .02 for $13 and get it instant since you can pay me with paypal.

I live for now and $1000 means ALOT. You don't know how hard I work for this and its just gone in a matter of seconds..

Damn.. this is the first huge scam I've encountered. 
$1000 means so much to me and its just gone..

I hope so but this set me back so far.. basically to where I started. I feel like shit and can't even do anything against it. Thanks though.

I have heard of BitQuick approximately 2 weeks ago but only briefly checked out the website this week.
I like that it appears to be a new somewhat quicker approach to buying Bitcoins than what exists now.
I dislike that it seems only a limited number of banks can be used. I have a Schwab bank account and I didn't see that listed as an option.
