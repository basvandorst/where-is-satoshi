What work are they doing? What are they doing besides turning money into more money?

Good plan.

Yes, I have gambled before. People who gamble on a commodity or stock etc. do not do anything positive for a society and negatively affect it.

I understand we are not going to agree. If you agreed that a person inheriting money and making more that thousands of people, I could take 3 or 4 argument steps and arrive at capitalism is immoral. It was an interesting discussion.

I began thinking of welfare and parasites. I just wrote about it in another comment in this post. 
If you give your kid an inheritance, I agree, that can stimulate an economy. That kid didn't do anything to deserve it, he or she didn't work. They did not do anything to make up for that use of resources.

How does everyone having the ability to do something affect it at all?

I understand everything you are saying and I agree with most libertarian ideas. It is a completely voluntary transaction and it might not even be negative or it doesn't matter. Can you agree that there could be 100% voluntary transactions that do not harm either party, but are morally wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:14:54
I would agree. I am taking it a step further, if you buy a share of say Ford, then you sell it later for more money, what have you done besides made money? You allowed them to use your money.

I don't know what you think about my post. Is it so strange to think of you buy a BTC for the sole purpose to make more money, you are not doing anything positive?
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:44:49
If you move commodities, you are doing something of value. If you buy one BTC or one ounce of gold then sell it later at a higher price, what good have you done the society?

This such a fun conversation because it quickly becomes a discussion about very deep questions about how our economy works. You don't agree with speculation? That means you don't agree with the stock market. So that means you are against our economy.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:39:27
So what are you buying then?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:09:26
I agree that you are not twisting anyone's arm to buy or sell something. If you would say that the society doesn't matter I would accept that. I am just arguing that if you make money by buying low and selling dear, you are doing nothing of value to the society.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:38:48
But what is that doing besides turning money into more money? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:53:41
That isn't the same thing. I am talking about people buying all of food in a starving area, then waiting to sell it when the price goes up.

Going back to fairness. Should we try to move towards fairness? Capitalism is inherently unfair. There needs to be the poor and the rich for it to operate. 
So a Walton kid gets a huge inheritance or gift. They then invest that money, they have a lot of power over the economy compared to normal people. Why should this person have such power? What qualifications does this person have? Why should a minority have the majority of the power in an economy? Then you take the step, can we run an economy democratically? Instead of one dollar, one vote, we should have one person, one vote. 
Another way. How does money make money? It is from other people's work. This person is taking their money and turning it into more money by other people's work. They are not doing any work, yet they make money. If you agree to that, that is just anti capitalist. 
The argument sort of boils down to, it is immoral to make money without working? You can easily point to any form of welfare and say that is making money without working. My mother is on social security disability and Medicare. She doesn't work. Socialism just says we should care for one another. She is a parasite, but also a human. Should I care about the widow down the street? Should I help pay for a kids education even though I don't have kids? Individualism vs collectivism.

You can be the child of Sam Walton, be given billions of dollars. You then invest that money. The investing is all voluntary, all truthful, no harm caused according to you. That person can make more money per year that hundreds or thousands of people's whole lives of working from just having money.

Just because I have done something negative to the society, doesn't mean that I have not done something negative. 
If you buy gold with the sole purpose to sell it in the future at a higher price, you are not doing any work and are only taking money out the economy. If you buy high and sell low, you lose money and the rest of the people with that commodity made more money without doing anything.
