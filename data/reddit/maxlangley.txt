I'm having problems too.  It took 21 hours for my withdrawal yesterday.  I lost money in the opportunity cost of sales I would have made.  Now all my withdrawals from Coinbase keep bouncing back.  I put in the verification code, it says pending, then the pending withdrawal (transfer to Cryptsy) just disappears.  :-/

Whatever they are, I'm dissatisfied and I dislike the way they are handling my case

Can we please focus on the *good* that this article will bring instead of the bad?  This subreddit has been such a downer lately.  
The ATM operators didn't even have a choice.  If they wanted to put the machine on American soil, they had to comply with U.S. laws. 
But the article itself is still good press.  We should be *happy.*  There has been so much BS revolving around bitcoin lately.  MtGox, the Silk Road heist, etc.  The reason I posted this was to bring back a taste of optimism.

Security seems to be compromising functionality here.  As a consumer, I don't like this.  
I buy on Coinbase and instantly transfer when they claim my coins are available.

Their slowness is costing me money, and they clearly lied to me.  I'm looking for a new exchange.  Do you have any recommendations?  (They lost a customer for life).

Why would their support team lie to us?  That sounds like a bad idea...

Why would Coinbase face substantial exposure to sharp price moves if they're just a medium for trading?  They don't actually own the bitcoins.  That's why I'm confused as to their really slow cold storage methodology.

The instant buy limit decreased?  On my page, it still shows $100 per week (and $1,000 per week once I wait the stupid 30 days).  I think they should *increase* it, not decrease it!

+100 doge verify 
(Sorry, no bitcoins in the tipbot.  But I just had to give you some internet money for that!).

How hard is it to take the bitcoins from cold storage and put them in the hot wallet?  How could the process take more than 30 minutes?

What if regulation meant bitcoin would reach $12,000 a coin.  Would you want it then?  What if regulation meant main stream adoption?  (I'm undecided on the issue).

I think that's some mighty fine journalism.

Maybe Europe will have less requirements from the government.  This ATM is located in America.  Land of the free.

It's still really frustrating.  They sure weren't transparent with me in the first reply.  Try clicking the link they gave me.  I get an error: "Couldn't find that transaction."

I think those are reasonable security measures because once bitcoin is hacked/stolen, it's pretty much gone forever.  But I do understand the desire for anonymity.  It's a delicate balance.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:18:05
What ponzi scheme?  
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:38:34
If these measures have to be put in place to appease the government, then do you think it's a better idea to have no Bitcoin ATMs?  I think adhering to some regulations may be a good idea for Bitcoin's growth and vitality.

Pick me :).  
Edit -- missed it by one!  :'(
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:21:33
Wow.  Very well written response.  What level of security measures do you think would be reasonable?  Give me an example of your "dream bitcoin ATM."  
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:20:33
I'll try them out.  Coinbase is too slow, lied to me, and seems fishy (I don't understand their second excuse).
