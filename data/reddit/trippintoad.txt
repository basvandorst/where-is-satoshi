Negative in that mining from a mobile phone will probably greatly reduce the life of the phone, and not be profitable at all

This could also be a scam to get your login info

Lmao! Did you even read that before you posted it?
I’m going to go ahead and say you can’t mine Bitcoin from a phone

They’re spreading the FUD thick in that article. I do enjoy reading all viewpoints though

I mostly use Bitcoin to purchase other crypto. I really only trust CB with fiat deposits and I just go from there. It’s not used as currency outside of that in my personal life, but ONLY because where I live there is no way to use it. If we were more of a Progressive town then I would be so stoked to use crypto/Bitcoin instead of my card

Damn

Binance is .05% if you use BNB to pay the fees. Otherwise I think it’s .1%

Good post. 
I laughed at the part where it says “Naturally, it’s not perfect” right after showing a chart with USDT listed as USTD

Where in the ��?
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:46:14
Why? Genuinely curious
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:06:25
Okay never mind. I thought the block explorer or something was fishy.

You should definitely take out a loan, and then start margin trading. Huge gains!
