@_date: 2017-12-26 12:00:28
So now you just admit 750 was obvious. 
Each was useless. We can agree now. 
Let s celebrate!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:02:17
Do you honestly think there are a lot of lambos in GoC...
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:56:59
So you bought at 750 or 500 in the end?
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:02:38
I will grow up my IQ to 350 each :-)
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:02

You should go to casino and put your 1000 on a black at roulette. But wait for the good moment. 
Then put 2000 in bitcoin BUT here again wait for the bottom. 
Ez peasy
