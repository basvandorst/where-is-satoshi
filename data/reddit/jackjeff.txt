I don't think you need to have 85% of the world to be relevant. For instance the vast majority of people in the world do not have access to credit cards and sometimes not even bank accounts. 
I see this as a good thing overall. Apple Pay will force Bitcoin solutions and other payment systems to innovate... it's time credit card numbers as a payment option die.

You can buy BTC in person with 20% commission and you need to add the VAT on top of that... pricey

How on earth did you guys figure out what the source image was?
There is not much metadata going around in that file...

WarpWallet is not bad. Personally I would tweak things a little bit, but using both a seed (e.g. email address) and a secret (passphrase) and a strong key derivation algorithm (PBKDF2 and scrypt) instead of a simple hash, goes a long way preventing the kind of stupid cracks that were possible with the infamous brainwallet.
The guys from WarpWallet have a challenge for 20BTC for a very weak password (8 alphanumerical characters) with no seed and no-one has claimed it. There's a reason for that. Even if you optimize the hashing it will take you a long long time to brute force it, even with GPU optimized algorithms.
Here's what I don't like about WarpWallet though:
- It's in JavaScript, therefore slower than it needs to be. Also it runs in a web browser so beware!
- I could not audit the code. That's partly because I'm not familiar with CoffeeScript and IcedCoffee, but also partly because the dependencies on that project are a bit over the top. 
- It generates a single public address. I'd rather have one passphrase+seed generate a list of bitcoin addresses and not put all my eggs in a single basket.
- It uses both scrypt and PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1. And scrypt uses PBKDF2 internally. If you're going to use two different key derivation functions, you might as well mix up the hash function a bit. And SHA1 is quite old, we should stop using it.
Here's what I did
- I have my own code written in C. The project has a single dependency on OpenSSL, which is used only to convert the private key into public key (i.e. not something critical to generate the private key).
- I use scrypt with different parameters. PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA3
- My code generates a seed which is then hashed repeatedly to generate as many bitcoin addresses as I want.

Bad UI design in Windows and bad security have also "killed" people. So have cars, airplanes, electricity and all modern technologies.

I view the "21 million" figure as a high water mark. I wonder how many of these "21 million" bitcoins have essentially been irremediably lost... especially in the early days.

I don't understand why he claims that Segwit2x requires a middleman. It's a different block size, but in both cases, the double spending is avoided by having a block chain and miners? You don't need Bitgo for the Sigwit2x chain to work, or do you? Can someone explain?
