The GBTC premium over Net Asset Value right now is about 75%, so you are paying $1112/BTC instead of $650/BTC. There will likely always be a premium, but it was &lt; 10% in Jan 2016. So long-term holders will absorb most of that premium over time.

The value of the Bitcoin network is 1300x the $52 million extra annually in higher fees. How can this have strategic value?

Bad contract design. ETH transfers have to be coded in a very specific way due to the 1024 stack size. Ethereum itself and the EVM is not the issue. The DAO was hacked, not Ethereum.
The DAO was rushed out as a Venture Capital money grab and had multiple design flaws. Of course, $200 million size means most of the ETH Founders and their circles were heavily invested so... soft fork followed by a hard fork (just like Washington bailouts in 2008).

DCA is random behavior that (a) has no impact on return and (b) increases risk. If it was that simple to create a positive return everyone would be rich.

This is a very basic mistake amateur traders make. To repeat (a) making random purchases does not impact return and (b) any time you increase position size you increase risk.
DCA only works if you are a skilled trader... and swing trade to capture the bid-ask spread while DCA. Otherwise, it's just another variation of Free Lunch.
Also, a skilled trader will often dump the entire position and get the hell out... as opposed to being paralyzed and DCA to zero.

His primary thesis is in the title =  what tech goes viral and mainstream is counterintuitive and very hard to predict. Like RSS feeds failed, but this ridiculous 140 char thing called Twitter is now everyone's RSS feed. That's why every crypto poll predicting the next year is wildly wrong every year as far back as you wanna go.
