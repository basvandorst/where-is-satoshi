Syndra? Is that you?

About to buy. Don‘t know if I should wait for it to dip or just buy right now.

What are you even talking about? When did I say that I don't want to pay the costs? The mind boggling thing for me is being forced to work for 1 year while getting 300€ a month. I don't know if you replied to the wrong person or not but your reply doesn't make sense.

I do see the benefits. It has helped me be more communicative, social and responsible. I can now understand what the elderly go through, their day to day struggles, illnesses etc. There are benefits, definitely, but the detriments outweigh the benefits in my opinion. Not to mention the pay is absolutely ridiculous for the work I do/time I spend. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:04:08
On average people get around 1400€ where I work for 40 hours a week. I get 300€, wanted to emphasize that I get almost nothing for the same job.

Bin schon im Zivildienst, 4 Monate noch. Inkompetente Regierung, war schon immer so und wird für eine lange Zeit so bleiben.

I am. I'm trying to learn Java right now, my first ever programming language but it's kind of overwhelming. Hopefully I'll get the hang of it, though. If everything goes well I'm thinking about stuyding software engineering or media technology and visual computing. 
Theodinproject sounds interesting but I'm not too sure what RubyOnRails is. Is it some kind of IDE? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:13:45
No, it's around 40€ per year. Other than that it's completely free for 8 semesters. After that you pay around 360€ per semester.

I get "breakfast" (bread and cheese/ham) and lunch. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:33:19
Prison I assume.

I thought the minimum wage for the US was $7,25/h. I get around 1,50€ an hour. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:35:28
That's what is keeping me motivated. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:15:38
If you mean Java I look for resources online, no particular site. Videos, tutorials etc.

My biggest complaint right now is that I'm forced to do civil service in my country. Basically you work in a retirement home or something like that, 42 hours a week and receive 317€ a month. My plan was to go to university and work part-time after getting my Higher School Certificate but noo, my beloved country wants me to waste a year of my life and try to get by with fucking 300€ a month for **42 hours a week**.  What the fuck, Austria? 
Sorry for the rant. I had to get it out of my system. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:34:19
Ja, das Problem ist aber, dass ich dazu gezwungen werde. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:00:22
Seriously. My broke ass would be fucking happy about 1000€ right now. Fml I'm jealous. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:27:28
I don't have any other options though. That's the point. Either I do it or I go to prison.  
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:37:22
Nope, I meant I'm working 42 hours a week and I'm paid 300€/month. 300€ per week would be a dream. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:01:21
It's complete bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:31:20
The pay isn't low when comparing them with eachother but the pay for both of them is low.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:34:26
Nothing. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:54:42
I don't know about that. I don't know if the definition of slave would apply in my case but my time and liberty are taken away. I'm a member of a society which decided that forcing young *men* (not women) to serve others instead of focusing on education and setting the pillars of an independent life is the way to go. 
We worked to change the laws. We had a referendum in 2013. The government decided to ask **everyone** instead of those whom this system affects. Women were allowed to vote, people who don't have to do civil service were allowed to vote. Guess what? The majority voted for the system to stay as it is. 55% of all the women voted in favor of the system we have now. 70% of young men under 25, who are affected by the military/civil service system, voted for a change. I still can't fathom the decision to allow individuals who are not affected by this to vote.

Thank you! By the way, nice username.

Can't move to another country without having enough money. Creating a new identity would be a crime and if I'm caught I'm in prison. Hiding leads to prison as well. Commiting a crime in order to be put into prison intentionally...puts me into prison. That's the **forced** part the other guy was talking about. I have literally no other option. Yeah, it is the easier path to just go through with it, which I'm doing by the way, but why should it be like that at all? Other countries manage, why can't we?

Newbie here. What is the difference? What is the picture trying to tell me? I don‘t get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:04:01
Damn, I wanted to read up on Bitcoins and get into it but stuff like this really throws me off. The chance of my money just getting..lost? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:47:41
Newbie here. Why is cex better and how does it differ from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:04:37
I‘ll definitely read up more on it before diving in. Thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:14
Stumbled upon the app called 'Coinbase'. Thought about using that for everything, is it any good? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:14:20
I‘ll look into it, sounds better. Thanks a lot.
