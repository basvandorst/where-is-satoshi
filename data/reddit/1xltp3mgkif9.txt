I'm in crypto since few years, I understand what's going on, and I'm also holding since 19k.

The price was $200 at the time of the presentation. Now it almost reached $20,000. So the prediction is getting less and less dumb actually.

It's not a blockchain though.

In my country nfc payments work in almost 100% of stores (Poland). Also very safe, and easy because I have to/can unlock my phone via fingerprint before transactions.
