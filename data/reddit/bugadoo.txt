Do you know any bitcoin machine in Canada, which is not reflected on the map?
There are 3 machines in Edmonton on the map, and yes, all of them are one-way.
I don't think it makes any sense to compare bitcoin ATM (which is exchange machine) to bank ATM (which is withdrawal machine unless currency of withdrawal is different from your account currency), they have simply different purposes.
One-way machine is useful because you can easily buy bitcoins there. This is practical usage. If you want to sell, then it is not useful for you, but not in general.
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:30:58
Looks like you used this one 
As mentioned here  and was pointed by several responses to you, robocoin requires 6 confirmations before you can withdraw, now you have 188, so just go back to ATM and get your cash.

Didn't understand your argument about Canada. All the known machines in Canada are there. If you know any which is not present on the list, let me know and I report it.

You're missing couple of things here. First of all when you compare to MasterCard withdrawal  - it is different. Bitcoin ATM is currency exchange operation, however fiat withdrawal is in the same currency as your account.
Another thing you ask who uses it - well the pricing for ATMs (and 6% is the average) is totally reasonable on the market, compare it to localbitcoins where it can easily be 10-12%
@_date: 2015-05-13 09:50:23
The closest is in Osaka, but it's only one-way (Skyhook).
The two-way machines are located in Tokyo. Out of 5 machines in total in the city, 3 are two-way.
But it's not a good option, as it is quite far away from the airport.

There are two bitcoin ATMs in Winnipeg 
One is at Chaise Cafe &amp; Lounge and the other one at Santa Lucia Pizza.
The latter is two-way, so you can not only buy bitcoins, but also sell bitcoins there.
The average fee for bitcoin ATMs is about 5%, but for small amounts this might work for you.

Good news that it's increasing, probably correlates w/ lowered price and people invest via ATM, but in general the machine isn't profitable, right?
W/ average 5% fee after half a year you got back only 1500 GBP, while purchase costs were about 4500 GBP probably not taking into account maintenance and liquidity support

The one from General Bytes looks like a good option, here was  [a review]( you also can get a discount by using a code. They planed to launch two-way machine as well.
There is one new machine from BitExchange  - they just launched the first unit. Looks like they use Lamassu open source sotware, but should be cheaper. Maybe you would like to try them.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:39:40


I won't argue about the usage level as nobody knows this except maybe operators within their network, however, the first figure is definitely far from truth. Non-functional machines are removed from the map regularly. This is the most up-to-date map I know, so it is probably more like at least 90% of those locations are actually true.

The fee mentioned includes all the exchange rate fees as well. This is actually a fee calculated by Coin ATM Radar, independently of what the operators announce.
5.5% is calculated based on real prices displayed at the ATMs compared to the Bitcoin Average index, so no additional costs.

In Vancouver and around there are 11 different bitcoin machines.
You have tried Robocoin before, which may be a bit clumsy for first purchase.
By the way this machine at Waves is now switched to be operating based on General Bytes software - so will be totally different user experience.

Your words definitely make sense, and you're right saying I have not operated bitcoin ATM. I just mentioned how popular Skyhook machines were, and what I mean - there are use cases for small box machines as well, maybe not applicable in all places / all jurisdictions, but still..

Portable machines have pros and cons, the advantage I think you can take it anywhere like meetup or gathering, where you can easily introduce bitcoin to new people by allowing to easy buy bitcoins, not only from you.
Yes, it's not a good idea to place this small box in not supervised place on the street in criminal district, but an add-on in a local business is a good idea. Of course, price makes sense.
Speaking about stealing machines, the ones in Netherlands were General Bytes and BitAccess. And BitAccess is quite big and heavy I think, however it was stolen as well.

Where does it come that ATM is something only to "withdraw"? Do you have a link? Automatic teller machine is a machine to replace teller in its functions, teller can give cash to clients (withdraw from account) as well as take cash and put it to account (deposit to account). Bitcoins ATM have two types: the ones which allow you only to deposit to your Bitcoin " account" and the ones which allow to do both.  So, just relax and take it for granted it is a "Bitcoin ATM"

@_date: 2015-07-30 20:27:42
This post is outdated, this price of 389 EUR probably was about the normal market price at the time of writing as bitcoin was worth more, and this feature is present in skyhook, so you as an operator can set the minimum price to sell bitcoins.
But I think it is about the fee they mention now Kraken + 4.2%, if the machine is still running at all.
And 4.2% is a good prooposal, as on average bitcoin ATMs take 5.5% commission.
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:13:17
So they confirmed that minimum price is 389 EUR? Did they explain it somehow?
Then it's just a rip off, because instead of Kraken+4.2% it is actually Kraken+50%, crazy..

@_date: 2015-07-14 14:42:16
if you are talking about bitcoin exchange - you probably should look into two-way bitcoin ATMs, most prominent players on the market:
* Genesis1 from Genesis Coin
* BitAccess
* CoinOutlet
* General Bytes
* BitXAtm
* BTCPoint
* Lamassu + special stand
You can find the full list here 
Normally it should operate w/o any requirements of somebody's presence.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:43:41
Sounds good, I mean General Bytes was just as an example, could be Lamassu (they also provided software for Robocoin kiosks I think - but I hear only about one-way), now BitAccess ported their (is it two-way btw?)
So you are not going to sell this machine, but rather try to give a second chance? I think the one in Harward might not be the best place, as there is another one close it. Too much competition, and being on Robocoin software you definitely lost the war.. Hope now it will change.

The analysis is done based on today's broadband speeds. Is it correct? However, it might change in the future drastically. I can imagine similar projection done 10-15 years ago and putting 56kb/s speed as a projection for 2015 year average speed.

Now I see, I missed the Y-axis log scale. This assumption makes sense. However, it is not clear what is the internet speed you forecast for 2035 for example in Norway for your calculations?
In a nutshell the problem will occur, when the internet speed increases with slower speed than bitcoin adoption (hence, blockchain size increase), however, these two figures have totally different growth charts I assume.
While internet speed will grow over time (although might grow asymptotically to some physical limitation as you mentioned), the adoption will have this S-curve, and newcomers will be described with bell-shape chart like 
So at the first phase - it is hard because bockchain size will grow with higher speed than internet, but then it will balance out as internet speed will be higher than block size growth.

@_date: 2015-11-12 16:00:02
I would not call myself an expert as well, but even from rough idea of sidechains, which you put in your post, is that those are separate blockchains, which means transactions occur on sidechains, and not on bitcoin blockchain.
I don't fully understand what you mean by "merged mining", but the idea is that bitcoins transferred to sidechains live their own lives there, and then they are just returned to main bitcoin blockchains, that means bitcoin miners won't get any fees for transactions happening in sidechains, which clearly decreases the incentive, as the block reward halving will shift incentives to fee reward in the future.
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:46:04
They don't "consolidate", only first (payback) and latest state transaction gets added to main blockchain all the rest "transactions" are just signed messages exchanged between parties, so with respect to volume and number of transactions - sidechains will definitely pull it from the main blockchain, and what OP says makes sense to me.

* these ATMs are quite expensive, in Africa it is hardly affordable for average Joe 
* the only demand I potentially see there - is receiving remittance from abroad, which basically means ATM should be 2-way, which is even more expensive to install
* due to low average income, there will be hardly a demand for bitcoin, compared to developed countries, where people can make some savings in BTC
* as mentioned before - in the developing countries it is much less secure to install the machine, than in developed countries. However, recently there were two ATMs stolen in the Netherlands

They have a spread of 8%, which means they charge only 4% on one-side, which is better than 5% you suggest.
Actually 4% is far better than market average for bitcoin ATMs.
@_date: 2015-02-05 09:37:33
That makes sense, but that means all the price fluctuation risk is taken by you as a customer, but not by the libertyx. They convert $300 to bitcoins at the moment when you redeem the pin code.
That means if the price goes up, they simply send you less bitcoins.
So they don't care whether you redeem immediately, in 24h or in a week.
The limitation of 24 hours they impose has nothing to do with price volatility.

Then looks I miss something here, as they mention they apply the rate at the moment of redemption, that means you purchase nominal in USD, but not in BTC as you said.
So my understanding was that you purchase a pin say for $50 and then when you apply it on the site, they use current exchange rate convert it to BTC and send you BTC equivalent at the moment of conversion, not purchase.
Actually 24h is still a lot for BTC volatility as the price can change say for 25% during one day.
Can you elaborate what you actually bought at the store? BTC or USD nominal?

Yes, you're right.
They sell bitcoin w/ 8% over Bitstamp approx, my assumption was just taking the middle, probably they use not BitStamp, but other exchange feed w/ higher rate.
Because I see at the moment the ATM buy BTC price is 222.43 and bitstamp is 221.39, which means selling bitcoins using ATM is even more profitable than selling over bitstamp.
But you're right, comission for buying bitcoins is pretty high.

Especially while you can purchase only $10/$30/$50 worth of bitcoins at a time.

If you go to the charts page on this site, there is one pie diagram, which shows that 36% of all bitcoin machines are actually 2-way. There was also a nice [post]( recently w/ the list of alternative bitcoin cash services. In some countries there are thousands of locations..

I would assume they are not so stupid, and rather were looking for cash inside.

What was the commission fee?

No, this doesn't make sense. On their site it is written "The exchange rate is set at the time of pin redemption (not pin purchase)." So they don't care about fluctuations over time.
24H limit is for something else..

Checked the temp folders. Have not found the file you mentioned. Scanned the full system with NOD32, also everything is clean.
Are you sure this is related to this particular site? Coinfinity is known company, they run bitcoin ATM as well in Graz. So potentially they could be hacked, but I was not able to detect any trojan files after visiting the site.
[Virustotal]( also does not detect anything for this URL.
