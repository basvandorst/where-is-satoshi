Bitcoin goes up 10% after a month.
Bitcoiners be like: To the moon!
Altcoins: Ok, lemme see that 10% gain in a minute ok thanks bud.

The thing about cryptocurrency is that it's still so new to the market, I don't think there is anyone that should be qualified as an "expert" on the market. Obviously there's those experts that know how the technological side works, but it's just such a volatile game, one that is in a completely different league than stocks. Like a Super Saiyan stock market performing a Kaio-Ken while taking steroids. Literally beginners can do better in this game than people with years in the game. I know I'm still relatively new to the game, almost 2 months in, yet my coworker who just started this week has already made better trades than I ever have. On top of that, even I have made better gains than a friend whose been grinding for 3 more months than I have. But the best thing that worked for me was simply studying subreddits. There's super helpful communities all around, with constant updates on what to look for and what goals, projects and partnerships certain coins are developing. Cryptocurrency is a dangerous game, but let me tell you, I'm having a lot of fun playing it ;)

Yeah I know. I've seen it time and time again within the short 6 weeks I've been here. I guess you can call the 7.5k to 5k a burst, but I wasn't too worried as I know it has come back up 100% of the time so far. And I've concluded that it will continue to happen with many coins for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:08:50
All I know is I'm looking forward to Christmas and New Years. For everyone in Bitcoin I'm November, y'all remember how Bitcoin skyrocketed during Thanksgiving weekend, as people were talking about their year at the dinner table, so no doubt Bitcoin was brought up. So I'm expecting the same result for these two holidays. Plus they're back-to-back, so I'm really being optimistic here! I'm only worried about tomorrow and how or even if the futures will have a positive or negative effect on cryptocurrency across the board.
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:47:29
Sorry to sound like a n00b, but how many types of coins are there out there? As in, we have erc20, DAG, and what else? What coin would Bitcoin classify under? I'm currently making a presentation on cryptocurrency at school if anyone  could tell me this that would be awesome, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:25:46
My Nano S comes in tomorrow! Super excited! :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:54:12
Actually pretty much everyone at work knows I'm into crypto, as many of them are themselves. The thing that makes me different than many people here is that I really like to talk about it with people, and I really Luke to tell them about good coins to look or for,  because like I tell other crypto investors,  I want everyone to get rich with me x) I just like to talk and help people out in general. 
Also my parents and sister know. My parents don't like the idea because they say it's a bubble, which I understand where they're coming from. And my sister doesn't really bring it up, as I only see her once a week anyways (she's married and has kids).
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:17:00
I think it's a nuclear bomb.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:08:33
Tbh, to those who say it's a bubble, I understand where they're coming from. But honestly, I see crypto currency as the future. So if it is a bubble, I'm gonna keep rising that bubble and make the most out of it. And to be fair, many of these "experts" (though I wouldn't call many of these people experts as cryptocurrency is still something so new and revolutionary) have been calling Bitcoin a bubble for years, and it still hasn't popped. In their defence, many bubbles do take years to burst, but like I said, I'm gonna make the most of it. And honestly you're still right on time, as I see massive jumps on Chirstmas week and New Years week :D Happened on Thanksgiving, but this double holiday coming up is gonna be a great time for all of us HODLers. And excellent idea getting a Ledger, I think I might do the same for myself:)
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:54:26
Then its the perfext rime tp buy. Trust me, even though ive only been in this game for 7 weeks or so, whenever Bitcoin drops, even to the point where it looks like too much, that is the time to buy. Just give it a few days and it always comes back to the top of even stronger. Can be said for almost and crypto currency.

20 y/o college kid here. Am currently 7k deep into the crypto market (roughly 75% of my savings). It would suck to lose it, but I figured that I am super low risk compared to everyone else, as I still live with my parents and I don't have too many bills to pay a month. So if I do go broke in this game, it really only sets me a year's worth of work back. Plus I truly believe that crypto is the future, so I honestly feel like it is the best investment in my life. I've already more than doubled my money the past month, so I only hope to continue the trend upwards! I just need to figure out jow to use wallets across the board as they're still a tad bit confusing to me. Also a big shout out to Iota, Raiblocks and Qash!
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:56:46
I know that much, I'm not saying like listing out Bitcoin, Ethereum, Iota, Monero, VeChain, Nano etc. I'm saying, many coins are erc20 tokens, there are some that are DAG tokens. So what type of crypto would Bitcoin classify as, as EOS is erc20, Nano is DAG, etc., and if there are other types of tokens besides erc20 and DAG.

Honestly I was trying to take a 3k loan from the bank yesterday to go invest more towards crypto lmao. I didn't mention crypto to them when I asked for the loan, but either way they told me they could only loan to me if it was for a car. Oh well, I guess I'll tell that to my other bank xD

Lmao I was talking to my Macroeconomics professor, and he said the whole thing was like the Dutch Tulip. As he is an older fellow, I see where he is coming from, as this technology is something we have never even seen before in history. Besides, the Dutch Tulip was more of a fashion statement in parts of Europe I believe, whereas the crypto market is worldwide. I truly believe this is here to stay.

This is my attitude because I know it's gonna get WAY better throughout the year. If people are claiming to be hodling crypto long term, why panic sell after a month? This is money you claim you won't touch for a long time, so why worry about it at this instant? Only true hodlers deserve riches.

Damn it, there are no such things as experts in the crypto market! I'm no expert, but even I've been saying it would hit$50k eoy 2018 since last year. But who really knows, it's all speculation.

I got started in late October/early November 2017, and that's still before Tai even got into crypto. Even though im not too experienced, I've still studied a lot and still know more than he does about this! So if has offering a $600, course, how much would I be able to charge?! -_- I like the guy as a living meme, but acting like an expert, talking about Bitcoin hitting a million dollars is just absurd.

What traders know is that it will fall under 7k again. I mean, c'mon, BTC barted up *3* *times* in a row from sub 6k to 8.5k. What barts up must bart down. I doubt we'll see sub 6k, but sub 7k is not far-fetched at all, and I'd even argue inevitable.
