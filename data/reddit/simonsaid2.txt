Living in America I/we are blind to some of the true possibilities bitcoin represents.  I hope that through the grapevine, my and our use helps give bitcoin enough momentum to push through the economic and government corruption of other countries and give it's citizens an alternative and spendable currency that is safe from their own countries currency inflection and instability. 
Observation - 1st worlders stand to gain from opening their eyes and seeing how a little for one can me a whole lot for another. 
Me - just a humble new professional trying to make it in the world.

Very nice work!  A beautiful visualization of what was before very much a mystery.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:44:37
Looks like the block was solved.

Did you dust one address in particular?  Would be interesting to see these 12,000 confirm (and proof).

Thanks for doing this AMA!  Some very helpful tidbits so far.
BTC-e, and a slew of other exchanges have fallen in the last year(s).   Many of us may have had coin there when they closed or once had coin there.  For tax purposes, the transaction and deposit/withdraw logs are now gone, poof, not available.
How does one go about reporting transactions in which the official exchange data is not available?  
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:54:10
has anyone considered the possibility there may be something fishy over at BTC-e and causing some people with fiat to enter positions and get out?  No word yet of any withdraw issues.  
I do the majority of my trading over on BTCe and will be watching this closely.
Edit:   The reason I suggest, is that in the last while, BTCe has followed market moves and very rarely if at all been the market leader.  In recent times when a market has made a move, there has been overal capitulation among all markets and equilibrium of price.  It's been a good few hours since and the other markets have only begun to nudge and the latency is very apparent.
Edit 2: from the daily discussion over in :

Its not that it is not possible, just not yet realized.  If the btce servers were for some reason hacked, then we would be the last to find out.   So far tho, no indication this is the case.

That's it - they said it. 
Virtual currencies are not illegal. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:01:05
The panel is refusing to talk about Bitcoin.  They are using past 'virtual financial institutions' as sole examples of their power and success in regulation and catching the bad guys.  There is a major difference between Bitcoin and Liberty Reserve and eGold.. that is the inherent lack of a central bank or governing authority.  This really should be addressed.  
Tom is really making a hard case to have the panel address Bitcoin and current cryptocurrencies but they are simply refusing at answering his questions.  The political dance is frustrating.

Thanks for the morning LoL.

As a resident of Palo Alto, CA - I strongly support this!

I have the same question.  Signed up with a different email than my coinbase email.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:24:20
Not here.

This guy is something else.
Guys guys - I think I might lack common sense - "In my brain"

In the area on travel often.  I would make a point to stop in for a BitMeal.  
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:10:57
I agree with you here.  Panic mode has not yet set in.  So far seems stable just under 260.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:45:01
Mind you - If I hear "As I said in my testimony" one more time... good lord.  WE KNOW.

Thanks for sharing and caring!  
Giving Bitcoin and all it's people a good name.   
Cheers and happy Thanksgiving!

Go Tom - the analogy he is trying to make right now has huge potential.  Relating the internet and how there were inherent evils and fears during its inception.

Now.. what if you live in the US but gave your acct details to a trusted contact overseas - could you still technically do business on bitfunder?
