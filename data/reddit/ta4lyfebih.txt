You asked if arbitrage occurred on other exchanges when this happened I said obviously it would and now you’re explaining what arbitrage is? I can tell you for a fact that I don’t know what in the hell *we* are talking about
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:55:25
I don’t think you know what arbitrage is... those ‘huge arbitrage opportunities’ last minutes because arbitrage means that the prices around the exchanges will catch up to the ‘real’ price. They will all always catch up.
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:20:22
Because you asked such a ridiculous question if you actually know what arbitrage is. If you know what arbitrage is why would you wonder if other exchanges arbitraged to the new value? I said obviously they would and then you started talking about huge arbitrage opportunities.
Seems like we’re on the same page and if we’re not it’s okay this book is overdue anyway ima go hit the library have a good weekend brudda

Can you elaborate? I thought futures balanced themselves. In order to buy a short future there has to be an equivalent long future from someone else. It’s not like every single person buying a future is investing in bitcoin’s failure. Only half of them are. 
So what do you mean by etf’s balancing? Idk even what an etf is so I’ll look into it now but if you have any more insight I’d love to hear it

I’m somewhat newer to crypto but I’ve noticed this too. Have you found coins with fiat offramps (ETH and LTC mainly) have started moving more with bitcoin’s moves or are they still firmly in the ‘alts’ category? I feel like the last couple bear patterns ETH has been more elastic with btc and is gaining recognition for itself as its own crypto entity (kinda like a Batman and robin/btc&amp;eth) but maybe that’s inaccurate. Is bitcoin still and always its own beast?
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:34:24
I don’t, please explain if you don’t mind.

This seems like an interesting article and I’m definitely going to continue (just got to part 2) but this, despite explaining the idea of futures trading, also missed the point.
For you to enter a contract with someone who agrees to enter a future trading contract with you, one of you must be betting on success and the other on failure. And there must be an equal amount of money on either side
If ‘all’ the institutional investors wanted to sell - as this fud always wants to suggest - there must be an equivalent amount of money that wants to buy. Supply and demand is EQUAL, so price will not be driven in either direction.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:46:42
‘USDT was being printed by the hundreds of millions at a time when demand was lowest’
Obviously, to prepare for the inevitable dump that occurs at the end of the rally. Most people will want to cash out some btc to ‘usd’ and given that the btc price is now double what it was a month ago, we will need more ‘usd’ to accommodate all the traders wishing to sell.
Will keep editing this as I read more but I think it’s somewhat safe to conclude that this author is a dweeb and doesn’t really know what’s going on

?? Hello. the idea of a future is that it’s a bet - someone will lose and someone will win. If these big institutions want to short btc down someone has to match the bet amount going long on btc. That someone who goes long and loses has no incentive to bet huge sums of money on a loser and lose all of their money. Even if it is somehow ‘endless’. 
If you’re having a fist fight with Floyd mayweather and somebody gives me $999 for free to make a $1k bet on you winning, I’m not gonna put the extra dollar down on you out of my own pocket. I’d rather put my one dollar on Floyd. And that’s if your weird conspiracy that I’m somehow handed $999 is real. And also your weird conspiracy that everyone in the room somehow knows that one side is mayweather. 
Not to mention that there were literally fewer than 200 futures contracts iirc that were sold. At only $5M a contract that’s fewer than $1B in futures betting. Overall crypto market cap at that time was like $700B. 1/700. That’s nothing. If everyone knew about you vs Floyd, only 200 people were stupid enough to bet on you. So there’s no real money in the betting game. Big whales would have much more incentive to actually sell btc instead of just betting on it because there’s waaaaaaaay more money to be made there. And now, two months later, we see that the futures contracts didn’t really mean all that much in the grand scheme. Crypto is still on the decline and ultimately there wasn’t enough money in the betting game to justify betting over actual selling. 
The real discussion is tether. If anything the futures contracts could have been FUD to distract from large institutional selling and artificial inflation with tether. It makes a lot of sense to print a ton of tether when people are selling btc because there’s a high demand for tether. And it makes sense to print a ton when people are buying btc, in anticipation of the high demand for tether when the btc selloff occurs. If the audit on tether comes back negative it would be disastrous for crypto. But honestly as unrealistic as it seems to print $340M at one time that’s actually backed by real money, there’s definitely people/institutions who have that kind of money to spend so the tethers could very well be really truly backed by actual usd. Everything about tether - good and bad - somehow makes sense; we’ll just have to wait and see. 
Personally, my explanation for the crash is that the futures contracts were announced and that induced profit taking on the heavy 2-3x ROI in 2-3 month rally that had just occurred, and economics took over as a retracement began. Regulations and ICO drama kept the retracement healthy for a bit.,Then bitconnect fell, and the retracement evolved into a crash. Lots of fud in the water + a mass exodus of scam victims and others with shaken faith has kept prices suppressed even further. People are getting more suspicious of crypto in general and in specific, many random low MC coins, and prices are reflective. We’re waiting for some good news to start to rally back up. A positive tether audit could be that good news to reinvigorate confidence in the market. But a negative tether audit would be another bitconnect.
What I don’t understand is this author literally spends the whole article talking about how tether is a scam, and then at the end says half his money is currently in tether.

A $300 short within a range/in a downtrend is really not unreasonable 
All the people you said goodbye to are not the same people leverage shorting bitcoin

That’s $1.40 per month... have you thought about playing runescape cause I’m pretty sure you can make $1.40 in like 4 or 5 hours on that game assuming you have a decent internet connection, which I realize is a whole nother conversation
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:57:29
No because you don’t own the other 99 btc anyway. The moment btc price moves to a point where your 1 btc is no longer enough to sustain the 100x leverage, the btc you borrowed will be returned to the owners and your 1 btc will be force liquidated. You will never owe more than you have but if you aren’t careful you can very easily lose what you do have
