How do you figure he had a 50k tax bill?
I don’t know about the states but I thought it was 20% capital gains tax on profit realised.
So if he’s paid $7,200 per BTC= $57,600 if he bought eight.
He sells for $120,000, so that’s $120,000 minus his original investment, which equals $62,400, which is the profit realised, plus you must in the US have a capital gains tax free allowance if so minus that first.
But for the sake of simplicity let’s not include that and work off deducting 20% off $62,400 which equals=$12,480 in TAX.
So his net profit should be $49,920 NET,
Plus this figure is without any other things like fee’s ect... that should also be tax deductible. 
Also you can  say something is a taxable event  only if a profit is realised, meaning if your profit dropped too below the point at which you realised a profit, then you would be in loss, and that loss would be tax deductible against any gains.
I don’t know the US tax system but in the U.K. the HMRC won’t tax something you haven’t had, and you only have when the money is transferred into fiat.
Enlighten me please as I don’t see how this guy is in this situation.

@_date: 2018-04-08 07:02:50
I don’t know the whole truth on what you’ve said I can only go on the uk tax perspective, but I agree 100% with your figuring and I cannot see if you did any of those how they could prove otherwise.
Capital gains allowance in in U.K. is just over 11k, anything above is 20% tax minus cost of the original BTC and miner fees ect, not difficult to calculate and pay.
Trading though is grey area done on a case by case scenario, if you prove your a hobbiest speculator there is no tax payable, as it’s akin to gambling.
Buying other coins I believe is a taxable event, but even if those coins go up the tax should be 20 % when you cash out.
If you don’t cash out and the coins go down below what you paid you can have the loss, carried into any gains.
Personally I know all is recorded it is traceable, but it’s a massive job, believe me they are relaying on people being honest and reporting their gains.
I’m self employed in the U.K. and I can off set a lot of things against my final tax bill,there are also countries where no tax is payable, it’s having accounts in those countries though for that purpose.
Or go on Holliday and change crypto in countries that have tax free policy.
But a loss is a loss you cannot be taxed on a loss, in the U.K. I’m convinced they are only interested in what’s going into your bank account for tax reasons.
On chain or coin swapping is nothing more than virtual magic beans, means nothing till cash out time.

Clearly you don’t understand UK taxation either or you would know any loss made here in any tax year doesn’t have to be rolled on, as it is a loss so there is no tax to pay.
Clearly you have a different tax system but is it better than the U.K. and cheaper well that’s debatable as I only ever see people from the US moaning on here and not others from Europe.
And if you believe your tax system is cheaper i believe your clearly the bigger fool as we in U.K. don’t you get loaded for health care costs, generally mate that’s an added tax hahahha.
Either way the guy who said crypto ruined his life is talking crap because he must have realised a profit somewhere and rightly so he should pay his tax.

@_date: 2018-04-18 18:50:34
That’s because most people are lazy sheep that need herding each day by a centralised authority.
Most people in the U.K. don’t even know what interest rate they pay on their mortgages, barely worth trying to educate them on the subtleties of Bitcoin.
And the biggest problem is most people live pay cheque to pay cheque and have little money left for buying crypto.
This is the reality of living on an over rated, over expensive island with below average wages, a housing crisis that is out of control and a government that doesn’t give a fuck.

I doubt sincerely they can track all crypto transactions even with software designed to do so, just think about the scale of the task.
Most tax authorities have trouble collecting normal tax from individuals that are self employed and get paid in cash on occasions.
That is why governments would rather have everyone working for companies so that the tax is deducted at source and easier to claim.
One thing for sure is that it is good that Christine Lagarde has an open approach.

And when your saying growing with your economy you talking rubbish as Quantitative easing is done when an economy isnt growing, it’s done when an economy isn’t, to spur growth by creating money that doesn’t exist for lending.

More and more debt debt debt debt and so on.

I think it’s correct that you need incentive via payment (miners) making sure all transactions are good.
In truth all other so called Blockchain seem like databases, I am interested myself as to how secure or vulnerable they are when hacking takes place, or can they be corrupted with viruses ect?
As if banks go down this route or large companies do, I’m sure their Blockchains will be tested by hackers.
If they are shown to be weak and pointless, real Blockchain with a token like BTC will become worth more as setting up your own system like BTC takes a lot of doing.

I wouldn’t want anything to do with that system.

If any individual out there has to tell you or show you why there is value in certain crypto tokens, then I would beg the question why you own them in the first place.
As for your reasoning on real world use, please remember the early days of each new technology that dictates our lives as we speak.
You are one of many who clearly lacks vision, that’s not your fault it’s because you have been conditioned that way.
The one biggest mistake all people make with crypto tech is the stupid remark they make about what it can and can’t do, as I assure you it can be anything it wants over time with the right software upgrades, it may not be that thing today but it will be in the future.
There is nothing wrong with being paid in USD or any other currency, that’s life and I believe there is nothing wrong with investments either, as a general rule people who invest who are patient and cleaver generally make more money over time than joe who gets paid in USD or other.
Moving forward let’s hope you yourself are not one that has to have a bitter outburst on reddit or other because Bitcoin does in the future what you clearly don’t think it can £££££££££ ��.
Peace out.
The funniest part about what you’ve said about having to have an ID card wherever you go in the states, and also the fact that they only accept certain payments, let’s break the irony down of which you speak, remembering firstly BTC stands for FREEDOM.
America the land of the free, what a load of bollocks, having to carry an ID card is a reflection of a society that is far from free, the Jews in World War Two nazi Germany where painted with the Star of David, similar for you with you ID cards really.
As for your shops not being able to interact Apple Pay and only letting you use certain payments, that’s Stone Age and utterly lacking.
But if Paypal or visa or other wanted to use BTC as a payment option, it can be integrated so people wouldn’t even know they’d pain with crypto.
Those crypt related payments could come directly off your standard visa or Amex cards if those companies gave  the green light to incorporate them.
I can’t see anything you’ve said that has any sense or fore thought, if I was you I would go back and think about crypto a lot more.
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:07:44
NO, I’m basing my argument of probability and utility, and also the fact that what’s in the past won’t keep up with the future.
Gold may have been round thousands of years but it’s not had direct challenge, and certainly one that’s better.
Ask most young people, BTC or GOLD, the former is their choice, then gold dies off over time.

That’s absolute rubbish you talk.
Show us the proof of what you saying please.
Are you saying that the fed haven’t increased the money supply so the fed haven’t devalued the dollar, especially since early 1970s?
If you are you are talking crap, now weather this chart is right or wrong the money supply has been debased in many ways, through mis management of tax payers funds and overspending on many projects including all the wars that have been funded since the early 1970s on the never never.
As of which is still part of the huge debts these countries still have today.

@_date: 2018-04-06 20:41:32
Yes but like I showed either way if your capital gains is 20% then he would have only the tax bill I showed, 
I don’t know your short term capital gains rate in the US so I can’t calculate that figure.
It’s still bullshit because if he sells the coins then he has the tax,even if the tax rate is 50% it’s only half the profit.
I think what he means is he spent the profit and the tax, if so he’s an idiot.
You can’t  be taxed anywhere for something you haven’t gained from. 
If I buy BTC and that year they go up by 50%, only to loose 50% the same year that gain becomes even, so no tax is payable.
Only when the crypto is realised into fiat through a bank account does it become a reality.
Other wise any one who has been hacked or lost their holding would also be liable for tax on something they owned on a Blockchain or in a wallet, but that they never had or got in physical assets.

Just because he’s a member of a political party you may not like or others may not, doesn’t mean he shouldn’t have a voice in a so called democracy.
Secondly the real reason isn’t to ignore his view, it’s more to do with the fact only a fool would argue that central banks manage the money supply correctly.
(Tax payers money not banks or governments)
Your last point is probably correct but this is the reason why stiff collared plebs tent to rule forever.
But as for UKIP being a joke, I think you’ll find that it was Nigel farage that took the U.K. out of the grip of the European Union, so they can’t be that much of a joke as that was a huge achievement that no one thought would ever happen.
I would say nick from your post you should go back to licking your obviously tori blue thumb, and leave crypto sites for those that support change like the guy for UKIP who dares stand up and say his piece.
Also may I add a little pointer about taking your opponent seriously, take crypto or mr Farage that I mentioned, which are both things that we’re dismissed as rubbish.
The moral of this lesson for you is that generally when you under estimate your opponent it will or they will destroy you in time.

I personally hope that these innovations don’t help institutions make more money than they already do, I hope Blockchain and crypto stays for the people.

Do you have a professional back ground in trading other commodities.
Personally I wouldn’t of thought that kind of volatility would exist either as id expect BTC price to rise slower than the predictions.
Volatility of 5k to 10k is huge, 250k drops is insane and I can’t see that happening.
Making millions on a sell and buying back at half the price, at those levels would be un realistic for the eco system.
Bad weather of any kind won’t see BTC drop below 4K, so 4K is stable bottom, either way one BTC is worth 4K.
By quarter 4 I guess 15k stable, with a drop of probably 10k in the sell off.
It will be more gradual in all cases.

No it wasn’t you idiot it was so they could fix the money supply by creating the euro first and foremost.
These arse holes in Brussels don’t want the U.K. to leave because they know it’s a failed state and project, and also the European Central Bank doesn’t know its head from its arse as to getting itself out the debt it’s in.
There are likely not going to be many people around like hitler again as circumstances have changed, and how laughable that you think Europe has the money to fund a war ��.
Good for the U.K. that they have the reserve to leave, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN and bitcoin.

Coinbase are becoming a problem and not a solution, they should support all the businesses that use crypto.

Debt to whom, who do you think brainiac? 
Oh that’s right to the people who pick up the debts eventually when the bubbles burst �� the tax payer, the likes of me.
No QE isn’t needed sonny in times when the sun shines, economies only need QE ect to spur growth, you are talking shite.

They shouldnt just review it, they should welcome all crypto.
Russia being one of the main countries to be riddled with sanctions from western governments, but then laughably sanctions itself on the biggest financial change in history.
Communist governments  don’t look or seem that cleaver, let’s hope they realise their mistakes.

When you buy your gold though, as in a physical bar of the different sizes available, how do you know that it is a real gold bar.????
Think I read that even jewellers have received officially stamped gold bars that have been fakes and not gold at all.
Begs the question how many of you have this pointless asset thinking you have value, but in reality you have none.
BTC can’t be faked, BTC is in that case better and safer than Gold period.

That would be that it’s not owned by the banks or regulated by them.
But it’s not anonymous and never has been, who cares as your ID is everywhere and easy to find.
anonymity isn’t possible.
Monero isn’t anonymous either, just harder to track.

He talks rubbish most of the time, his price predictions are ludicrous to say the least and I cannot believe anyone would fall for it, or believe it.
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:00:19
I think your vision is clouded, you seem like your the kind of person who because BTC hasn’t grown in the way you thought it would, that it can’t.
General public don’t even need to know when they take a payment card out they are paying with crypto, point is as long as the bills payed their happy.
As for your point about being in control of your own funds, I think that will take time for the masses to feel secure about that, but safer wallets will evolve also compared to what we have know.
On that point ledger and Trezor are very secure.
As for money laundering and terrorism, these are by all parts government failing globally, not crypto currency related, they would happen anyway with fiat.
It’s government policy that creates terrorism and money laundering.
So I think your wrong, I think we have just started and the knew model army has arisen and will continue its path for a crypto world.

Isn’t it obvious that digital currency is the better choice all round.
Gold blah so yesterday.

Explain what you mean.?
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:26:41
Yes I agree, think someone else needs to make a change.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:57:22
Have you used it?
I’ve never traded but I would like too, I don’t really see big profit though unless volatility is in the thousands up and down.
And that would mean far higher price than we have today, am I wrong or right?
Kinda seems like hassle to sell for £100 profit and wait to buy on the £100 drop, with fees tax ect,.., I’d like to do less trades but minimum of £1000 fluctuation.

Possibly that’s true, but unfair, all this tax situation can be simplified so all is fair, simply only tax at the exit point.
Don’t calculate taxes on chain or in wallet holdings, it’s ridiculous and complicates it.
Personally I think it will become such a tangle or transactions that they will eventually loose track of payments.
What I don’t get still thought is irrelevant of the year if the other crypto he bought didn’t make a profit how can it be realised as profit, and why would he need those loss adjustment figures of $3000 per year to offset.
He must again have made profit and not paid the tax.
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:06:51
Yes good idea I will do the same also.
Everyone should do this.
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:40:17
Your probably spot on with that, gold isn’t as good as BTC, BTC can do many more things than gold, with the exception  of Jewellery and electronics.
And I believe only 10% of it is used for these purposes.
Let’s get rid of it, buy BTC not gold.
If you believe in BTC you don’t need gold have faith.

The people who you claim are bitter probably don’t like change, and also realise they have missed out.
Generally the latter makes them even more stupid as they haven’t missed out because crypto is still cheap.
Take a look at people how pre programmed they are, working 40 to 50 hours a week in their mundane jobs, for a steady secure pay check in a system developed so as they never have enough from their mundane jobs so  that they have to come back for more year in year out.
Yet given a chance to make a packed with an element of high risk, most run away, they say I don’t have the money for investing in that, also they think all comers that do are dumb.
That is until the prices rise and the news spreads and then they are furious they didn’t invest and the negativity pours out on sites.
Who cares about these people, you will never have all the people using crypto, I know people who are so dumb that If you try to tell them how it works, you may just as well waste your breath and tell a door the same thing.
That’s why I don’t believe in selling it, let the worthy choose and the unworthy go.

But your voice has no content nick and his does, take HSBC who laundering billions state side for drug cartels and terrorist organisations.
They were fined a month profit and no one went to prison, this is just one bank.
I don’t see how you can disagree with a system in banking that’s broken.
You just make yourself look a bigger fool than they are.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:29:17
Absolutely true, every word.
Rich people forget quickly what it’s like to slave away year on year for little, they have no money value as there is always more in their vast pot.
They always talk about the success but seldom do they admit the failures, but their financial failures are generally soaked up by the huge gains they make of the projects that do pay.

How is this guy defining psychological and economic firstly.
All and every aspect of human evolution was at one point, surely psychological, and all the good and great or bad and horrible, where products of mind and thought.
Economics is also a psychological thought process and was throughout the history of its development.
This really does show just how little he’s thought or evaluated the meaning.
Also there isn’t any content to anything he said and no evidence, just more drivel leaving his lips.

Mark Cuban is just another boring twat with money that’s had the luck needed to make it.
These shits preach about what normal people should do because they are sat on the top of the hill looking down.
My message to Mark Cuban is FUCK OFF as no one wants your views.
