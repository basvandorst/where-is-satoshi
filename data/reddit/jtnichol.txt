I've listed to Phil numerous times on TS. He's an awesome person to listen to. That's a very loose room at times and the traders feed off each other. I trust Phil more than just about anyone in that room.  We're all trying to figure Bitcoin out including the exchanges. It's a volatile financial wild west.

 is useful for a myriad of currencies.  
Then use shapeshift.io to convert to Bitcoin or move them automatically on an exchange. Coinpayments I think can allow you to set your price in USD and fluctuate the BTC/ALT prices to suit the market.  Not sure what all the fees are but it's worth checking out. I'm in the same boat you are.
Good luck!

Noob here.  Just imagine for a moment Apple decides to adopt Bitcoin within their structure as an optional payment source.  Apple users could pay either way through their interface and charge fees both ways.  
I don't know because I use a windows phone and don't know about what Apple is doing with their pay feature.  Curious if that will ever be attractive to them?

He's slowly embracing the idea of it all.  I just wish as an IT guy he'd really get into the tech.  So damn fascinating to me.  Oh well I don't want to wear him out about it.

Ageism is not a good argument though.  In general perceptions do change but I'm sure there are plenty of old folks out there who would appreciate the steady hand of a teacher to guide them rather than to be talked down to.I mean....well they did land a guy on the moon etc.

Perspective.  I'm new to all this.  I've just purchased 2 coins in the last week and have tipped about 20 people and put a button on my site.  I'm a fan of reddit but now I'm devoting 99% of my time on this sub.Edit: 99% of my time on cryptocurrency
I'm focused and I've never traded anything actively before.  So....why not trade something newish and exciting and wholly illogical and finite.
I'm not investing more than I am willing to lose.  I'm even looking into other products like this marketing scheme 
I've heard of bitcoin and decided the best way to learn is to start the game with some skin and here I am!  Hope there are about a million more like me.

$370 is my sweet spot.  I'm in on 10btc at an average of $360.  I'm new to this as of mid November.  I'm playing some with alts with 1btc currently and up 10%.

Therein lies the difference in your marriage. My wife has common sense to a point but still maintains a separate credit card and has a copy of my credit card too.  We are independent in financial decisions. I pay for everything except school lunches. In fairness her job as a teacher affords our kids the best education in the area tuition free but the pay is dismal.  She doesn't spend money recklessly.
I on the otherhand am also a teacher but I make much more annually as a DJ on weekends. She doesn't understand why a speaker needs to cost $750 but over it's lifetime will be along for the ride for at least $75,000 in revenue.  Thus I'm the risktaker.
I even breathe bitcoin and try to explain what i'm doing with $3000 of it and I'll be putting an addition on our doghouse.
There is no communication about finances and it really truly sucks.  She's not a nerd like me....Frankly, it's ok because she's a great mom to our 4 kids.  I'll just keep the bills to myself and plug away.

@_date: 2014-12-17 20:24:34
In fairness....I feel like no amount of explanation of why I'm invested will ever please my wife. Especially at a loss... Much less how to use it.  In fairness she's 42 years old so I guess I'm an ageist too....
Now if Old Navy and Gap accept Bitcoin in 2016 I'll explain why they do and give her a way to spend some and she will be the biggest fan when that QR code comes in the mail for some kind of changetip bitcoin rebate.

Indeed...The difference is I'm losing and keeping a straight face about it.  Albeit I haven't lost 50% but I'll bleed for this idea to work...but if my wife EVER finds out I invested as a speculator in a crypto blockchain currency I would first have to explain the word "invest" to her before trying to tell her why I'm holding onto something intangible.  She's clueless.  I want her to be educated but we have other long term financial issues in our midst and marriage than this stuff.  I know it's going to be a better year for bitcoin.  Why?  Because I love rabbit holes and wonderous tech....

Moronic Monday Newb Question about Cryptowat.ch
When I look at the right side can someone explain to me the Red and Green bubbles? Yesterday when I was watching the plunge I noticed the Red side was deflated and the Green side was inflated. Does this mean there were more people buying than selling but ONLY if the price dropped to a certain level?
Also the Sticks at the bottom of the page: Is that an indicator of volume and red if the price went down and Green if it went up?
I've been trying to read about candlesticks and learn about markets in general.
On a side note Bitcoin was my first investment ever! What a fun rollercoaster! Like 20 story roller coaster! lol
Love it though

Are we in the midst of a huge amount of BTC flying around and getting into the hands of new people like me?  
Or is it a small amount of players playing the markets with large amounts of BTC to gather in $10 swings every hour?

Ok I have an experiment here.  I'm going to give this Ledger to Jonah and his sister. They are one year apart. I'm also going to make a reaction video because some folks are throwin' some in the pot. I'm going to make a "Dad Contract" and have them sign it and I'll give them an even split on their 18th birthdays. Until then, the Ledger and Contract will sit in cold storage.  Bits and Finney go below:
ETH Address:  0xa379321F8259e3a642Fb60526D644b10EF51c11A
BTC Address:  1D5tAMctkRBi3xM4Tdhb4jafj3pZTwsMiM
Any donations sent to the address will be theirs to own in 8+ years. This is the start of a journey.  It'll be nice to see them age on camera right along with me.  Should be fun. I'll throw some in there too.

Well that's not too bad....but they had to drive there to make the order I'm assuming. Less than 1/10th of a percent of total cost at 75 cents.  I'm still trying to get paid in BTC.  No takers....they would save almost $100 off our services that way.  
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:10:36
You are right. I think "exclusive" isn't meant to be "closed off".  It's just that everyone I know myself included really can't afford their services. I'm very humbled to serve clients there.  I came off a bit snobbish I apologize.  Really good folks there that work hard to make people very happy myself included.  I jump in with the staff and help in more ways than MC and DJ and as a result they really like us there as entertainers.  We're on a short list of about 4 DJ companies allowed in the place and it's an honor.  Phenomenal chefs too!

and the /eth trade subs are just as mad.  It's really disappointing and is causing the reputation of the community to go down. Vitalik Buterin has even tweeted asking the spammer to stop.

I'm totally in agreement with this statement. 
No need to pursue further....especially when the following conditions are met.
Old Man:  **Yes**
Stubborn Man:  **Yes**
Southern Man:  **Yes**
Combination of the 3 and the question isn't worth asking unless it deals with 4 out of the 5 listed below:
1.  **Titties**
2.  **Guns**
3.  **Money**
4.  **Whiskey**
5.  **Whiskey**
So in this rare occurance the young Bitcoiner has to try to ask the question...but alas the dominate old stubborn southern Bull walks away.
Just have a drunk girl with a gun tattoo try and buy a double shot of whiskey in his bar with bitcoin.  He might change his mind.

Not really sure why I love it so much.  But my plan is to accumulate and make a decision at the end of 2016.

Exactly 100%.  This was the response I was hoping for.  Bitcoin guarantees payment.  Further more even if they were able to acquire it I wouldn't accept it either knowing someone else got ripped off.  Aquiring Bitcoin through fraudulent wire activity would be difficult I'm guessing.

Not promoting bitcoin or accepting payment from this scanner.  I'm just trolling him.  At least with bitcoin I'm certain that its a legit deal.  Can't fake that transaction!   I'd like to see how many steps they would be willing to take to try and Nigerian 441 me.

I'm a legitimate business with a passion.  This text was from a illegitimate scammer plain and simple.  Bitcoin is the ultimate roadblock for trustless transactions.

I wouldn't either. It would be pretty hard to sit on that many coins during the 2013 bubble and not take a profit of any kind.  Nobody is that benevolent. Heck, even Jesus Christ himself would cash in and help the needy perhaps....

I'm just like OP.  I now have Trezor in a Ziploc bag in a safe.  Private pass phrase stored off site in 2 locations.

I'm one person who doesn't understand the tech at all. I can't even tell you the difference between a miner and node.  But alas I have my Bitcoin sitting on a Trezor in a safe like a good little hodler.
I'm willing to run a node if we need it?  I've been reading about stand alone units around $150 and that people who hold more than 10 BTC or whatever should possibly "pitch in".
SO...is this device plug and play because I'm in that category of hodlers.
thanks for advice

Thanks for the ideas. 
I should be more clear. This is a hangout for around 90 kids at my school alone. It's the Bitcoiners I'm interested in sharing a pool of kid friendly resources to the doc. The Hangout session will have around 3 or 4 Bitcoiners to handle a majority of the discussion.  Heck maybe you can jump in to!  I think we'll a chat capability too.  
We are seeking very low levels of donation. I don't want to turn this into a "do it for the children" event. In fact I just want the kids to see transactions happening in real time and learns bits about the history and perhaps spark their imagination about how this is going to be used moving forward.
Yes of course if the donations come in a large way we'll certainly spread the love to the Booster Club etc.  I figure if a person comes in and tosses some BTC we'll get their address and mail them one of the coins the kids design. It's really going to be a phenomenal way to show how commerce can be done in real time and goods can be delivered fresh of the factory floor.
I'm pretty new to BTC and have a few now.  I'm learning as much as they are!  I bought my first one in October last year.
Thanks so much for your willingness to contribute.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:19:22
What I mean by "opposite direction" is can I accept payment to the trezor through the phone's interface from customers?

Sure I suppose if it was something I talked about constantly.  I guess I talked about it for 15 minutes though.  Every now and then I talk about my family etc.  Showing kids what you are into gives them a sense of who you are as a person.Let us not forget about common core and the fact as a music teacher I am now responsible for incorporating math, reading, science and writing into my lessons.Candlestick charts are sort of a wave or vibration just like sound.  When I asked kids what they were looking at nearly every class had one student who mentioned that it looked like a sound wave.  Fitting answer because I have shown them wave editing software.  I'm not your typical music teacher.Owl City's "Fireflies" Performed By Students

My app usually shows 3400 BTC are mined daily on average.  What is the average because lately it is higher than that even as high as 4500.  Is this normal and has that had an impact on the pricing in significant way?  Does this affect Bitcoin days destroyed?  I'm a noob and maybe I'm not asking the right questions here or if they are related.  Thanks!
