Because these have already been in production for over a year, and still earning a profit?

Given the trickle of deliveries of ASICs, it seems like FPGAs are still a viable way to mine.

So are the ASIC machines.
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:08:25
Know anyone that makes one suitable for mining?
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:09:12
Is there a mining client?  ZTEX has a client for their FGPAs.

I'm doubting that any of the new ASIC providers will flood the market before too long.  Even so, the increasing value of BTC should keep your returns positive.

Yeah.  I'm a nerd, but not that big of a nerd.

You raise a very, very good point.  I suppose this would have made more sense last year before the reward halving.  Ah well, hindsight...  :)

I'd be happy to see your source.  These units and literally plug-and-play, and ZTEX has miner software for their units freely available online.

The ZTEX 1.15y I bought over a year ago was a little over $1k.  At today's prices, you should recoup your investment in less than 10 months.  If BTC goes up, less.

Delivery is anticipated to be 6 weeks.
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:11:14
The one you don't see, is the 1.15y, has four of those chips, and does 860MH/sec.

Correct, they're not much faster than a fully decked out GPU rig...  But the initial cost is cheaper, and they run on a fraction of the power.  My rig is an old ThinkPad with the lid closed and a 12V 4A adapter.  I figure my power costs are less than 9KWh/week.  That's way less than $10 a month in power, plus it runs cooler and quieter.
