It's not a re-gift, though.  If you *give* something to someone as a gift, you're giving ownership of it to someone.  If you're holding on to a copy for safe keeping, that's one thing -- plenty of people do this for their children, siblings, or even less responsible or "together" loved ones -- but honestly, holding onto it after you already gave it to them is basically just stealing because your "gift" now has greater value and you want it.  It was never a gift. You don't get a pat on the back for being clever when it's just you being an asshole.

But, uh, bitcoin is not a credit system, any more than an dollar is a credit system.
A company could use bitcoin as a basis for a credit system, but they'd still charge you fees for the services -- they would just charge it in bitcoin.  And despite seeing the transactions, you'd still have to legislate limits on those fees and you'd still get lawsuits like this one.

I think the kicker isn't that your mom drove you somewhere and made you do the work of looking for it, but that your mom didn't berate and punish you, then after it was all said and done, stated that she had it all along but fuck you cuz you're a kid and need to learn things.
The first is a life lesson, the latter is how people learn to hate and lose respect for one another.
Punishing someone for losing a gift and then rubbing it in their face or refusing to help them just kind of shows where your relationship with the person is at.

Credit card companies are actually excellent ways to combat fraud.
You can use them for a buffer to your real money, and because it's credit, it's not like you'll go to pay your rent and find all your money gone one day.
Most cards have great fraud coverage so long as you report the fraud as soon as you see it.  I have never, ever, had a card issuer refuse to roll back charges.

And no body wants to be working with currency by trying to do math in the fractions.
"Yeah, that will be 0.000000000005ths of a bitcoin, sir."
"I'm sorry, how many zeros was that again?  Oh, shit, I typo'd and now I need change back."
Everyday products need to be able to be traded in increments of whole numbers because that's how the average person thinks in math.

You'll be seeing a lot of other vendors following suit -- any that intend to operate in the US, anyhow.

Arguably, if you're hungry and all you have is BTC, you've already made some bad financial choices and you being forced to sell off your bitcoin to get food is no different than being forced to sell off that Lambo because you buying it made you homeless.
What I'm trying to say is, it's not a normal situation for someone with the flexibility to "hodl" and invest in BTC to find themselves in.
@_date: 2019-03-31 10:41:00
What's that got to do with my comment?
@_date: 2019-03-31 05:39:17
I feel like there needs to be a way to decentivize hodling, since we're working with a finite "resource" and are expecting people to move it around.

Money that is only realistically useable when widely accepted by merchants, or if you're using a middle-man processor like a card provider that totes promises to cover your charges.
You're either in a big city or you're eating the same thing all the time.

You can't separate bitcoin (money) from the blockchain (system) and still have bitcoin, so therefore you can't compare bitcoin with "hard money" like gold.
Even with fiat currency, I don't *need* a bank or payment processor to make transactions so long as the person I'm paying is willing to accept that it has an agreed-upon value.

Maybe it's just me, but, I was born into a middle class and then became poverty-level poor at a young age (before I was 13, but old enough to remember it "both ways").  As an adult, still got that "lesser way of life."
Sometimes you just got to ... not give a shit about money.  If you think it's how you get a happier life, then you are absolutely going to be miserable, and when you lose (and lose hard), you're going to let it eat you alive.  Even at the "lowest of lows", assuming you don't turn to drugs and alcohol and other crap that just robs you of your cognizance, you can turn it around.  Sure, you aren't going to be Donald Trump and driving around that 90k BMW, but you could get to a point where you can at least do a day lease on one.  ;P
Let your wins be wins, and your losses be an opportunity to win later.

It was an investment if you got in early and won.
These days, it's just a rollercoaster that keeps 'investors' engaged and obsessively looking at prices by the hour.

Exactly this.
Robber will have your bitcoin moved before he's even disappeared down the street and you'll never see it again.
At least with a bank, if they're stupid enough to steal your bank account information right in front of you, you can not only call the bank to freeze the account, but the amount is likely insured if they still manage to get it after the fact AND they can at least begin to track where it went.
Complete anonymity has it's dark side and we can't ignore WHY bitcoin is such a lure for illicit transactions.

Look at you, assuming people pointing a gun at you will take "no" for an answer.

I'm not going to argue with you, man.  I know what I've seen offered to some of the folks I've worked with, which undoubtedly may have been a "wink wink" discount rate.  I honestly don't care enough to hash it out with you over some other business's practices -- if you need to "win" on the internet, have at it.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:27:59
Exactly.  The prices I was quoting came from an enthusiast who rented his cars out from his repair/servicing shop, not a rental business with a big sign out on the street next to the airport.  My point is that if you *really* wanted to do this, the right price and the right car was out there if you asked around.  Guy responding to me is just being an ass.

Good to know information:  You can get one in less extravagant cities for the whole day, for a quarter of that cost.  Even less if you go for a non-lambo exotic or luxury vehicle.
It's perfect for when you need to go to a school reunion and one-up all those assholes like a total cliche.

Nobody said they'd be NEW Lamborghinis; there's no telling from where, or how, they were sourced.  But for the layman who just wants to know what it's like to drive one, who gives a shit?  They obviously make their money somewhere, or they wouldn't be doing it.
