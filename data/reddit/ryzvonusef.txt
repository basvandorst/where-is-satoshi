It's automatic, UPS have a system inside, if outside voltage falls below certain thresholds, it will switch over to backup until voltage returns.
Our problem is rather basic, no supply to meet demand.

Yes, this has been going on for YEARS, so every one has developed backups.

Both battery based UPS (uninterrupted power supply) and fuel based Generators.
Homes often have a small UPS, with a single truck battery. It runs a 3-4 lights and 3-4 fans for 3-4 hours (depending on how frequent main supply is available to charge the batteries). I've linked my modem to it.
Shops have small portable generators, since their demands are low.
Large offices, banks, malls, etc have large permanent generators onsite, since electricity outage is a regular and permanent aspect of our life.
In winters, since demand is low, we have lower outages, like currently we have outage every third hour (so about 8 hrs daily)
In peak summer, outages can reach 12-18 hrs daily.

And how do they even mine it? We have electricity outages every third hour!
