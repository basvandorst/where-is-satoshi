Been warning about this for years, no one listens, been telling people to buy crypto because it’s going be bad guys, crypto might be the only thing keeping your lights on or putting food on your table

Well in the current economic climate, there is going to be a crash worse than 2008 because all of the banks colluded and ignored the bankruptcy instead of facing it. This crash is predicted to happen within the next year and a half. This would make the dollar crash so likely one bitcoin would be worth a million but also a loaf of bread would be worth 1000 dollars.

I don’t think it will, but if it does, AYE-O

Hope you’re right, I wouldn’t mind seeing 5k just so I can buy some more honestly haha, we all know were going to have a bull run some time in the future so seeing 5k for a little while might be nice to fill up your bags. I’m not sure if tether will recover, there is a lot of evidence that it is a scam and after this people will lose faith in it. It hasn’t been audited either so no one even knows if they actually have 2billion usd backing it. Either way say far away from it and let’s watch the show!

I think I get what you’re saying, so people will acquire btc with tether by paying a Lower price like .95 per tether on one exchange, transfer it to an exchange that tether is worth more then sell it for btc?

Interesting, what does it mean for bitcoin? People see a “stable” coin as unstable and promotes a sell off? Or ?

Huge crash on the horizon after this whole thing, I’d wait. We could see 5000
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:53:19
I think they said it’s because as they sell it’s going straight into btc so it bumps the price
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:14:22
Rumor has is it, we’ll see 5000. Not only will it have rebound effect, tether after this will likely have a huge exit and assets will be sold, there is fear that if tether doesn’t bounce back from this that that will be 1% of the entire cryto market cap gone. That causes huge problems. We’ll see though, you really never know.

Beware, huge crash immanent 
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:56:15
Please explain

Interesting thank you. Is it possible they came out and did the whole BCH fork to drive price down in order to short BTC as they sell off their bags only to buy back more at the bottom with the huge gains they made off the shorts?

What does this imply? Sorry I’m slow in the head
