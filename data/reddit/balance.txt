In The Netherlands we have a privacy crisis: Our government want to push 'De Sleepwet' through, a law that gives out intelligence services the authority to spy unfocused on everybody by both wireless and wired communications. While many organizations are fighting for our privacy of us, Dutch citizens, Bits of Freedom is by far the most important. Our country tends to lead in most area's, but we're about to do a huge step backwards (we were the second country on planet earth to have net neutrality (the strong version, even data-free music streaming is illegal here)). With he risk that other European countries follow.
