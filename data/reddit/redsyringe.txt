Even if they fill up in a couple of months time, we would still be able to perform 2x as many transactions as before. This slippery slope to server farms thing is just garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:10:37
How much do you think the transaction cost is at the moment?? What do you consider an exaggeration?? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:14:53
No lol. Itd be better put into savings, or further education / training. Basically anything would be better than a rolex or the crap you're listing. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:52
I'm not blaming you, I understand it fine. But every man and his dog was here praising a few months ago saying it would solve the growing transaction backlog.... And here we are....
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:43
[Read this](
Original guy thought it would be doubling, and the others tried to correct him and said a 20% boost (which still hasn't happened months after activation). And they thought fees would fall off a cliff with that. That would be funny if it wasn't so wrong.


That last quote is from a source that you had previously linked ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:35:31
They would have probably said the same thing in 2013 when it was $200. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:35:41
Yeah, why not? Smaller market cap coin that will be getting a lot of positive publicity because of that price increase. Articles will also discuss its differences and advantages over btc.

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:07


But those are the reality and if done right, bitcoin would be less susceptible to those attacks. It's frankly arrogant for Core to offer solutions 'oh this will work if everyone else does XYZ to support it'. They have not compromised on anything and refused to acknowledge the NYA which they were invited to, yet refused to attend. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:42:36
Yeah I remember him too. It'd fit, but I think he killed himself months ago, not in the last couple of weeks.

I agree. But 10 btc isn't a little fuck up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:59:32
I understand that.
My point was rather that at a lower market cap it has a lot more growth potential.

Well done mate! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:56:27
Dw about the mempool. Sure bigger blocks would clear it in no time and mean lower fees. But at least we still have 1mb blocks and lightning network only another 18 months away.

@_date: 2017-12-31 03:56:29
It doesn't mean the fee will be 8x lower at all. You're assuming that total fees will be the exact same?? You don't know what you're talking about if you think that. ��

I was here at $200 and I thought 10k would come, but I thought a $200b market cap would peak in the couple of hundred billion (where we are now). $2T is an unbelievable amount of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:15:40
Tbh I'd use a coin which doesn't have $15 transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:58
I've had btc for over 4 years. I'm not part of a coordinated attack, I am just facing the reality that the network is barely usable for anyone who doesn't want to pay a $10 transaction fee. No other cryptos are having this problem, and I can't blame newcomers for not wanting to pick bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:31
Lol. It's hard not to find these stories amusing. Did you expect they would lose the private keys? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:59
Haha. I agree. Bitcoin keeps defying my expectations lol...
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:40:49


Yeah that's always been the case with bitcoin. The rest of the crypto world continues to move... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:55
How much do you think opening a channel will cost? I suspect it'll be more of the same pixie dust that segwit has been.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:22:03
Dude that 'conservative' 100k thing with 90% confidence is bullish af. I couldn't imagine it in my wildest dreams just because of the sheer volume of new money that would have to enter the ecosystem. Bitcoin market cap would be approaching $2 trillion??
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:18
Yeah, I've been paying $10 for a slow transactions for the last 4 years.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:43:55
That's absolutely terrible logic, and doesn't make a rolex any less of a dumb purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:24
BCH is actually good for transactions under $10 too. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:41:30

Was bcash really the biggest scare you've had in the last 5 years? Bought at a higher price, but it didn't really bother me because I had both bcash and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:39:06
Lol I do it through my coinbase referrrals.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:11:04
1 megabyte blocks isn't working. It's an inhibitor of adoption and use. Bcash has mere 8mb blocks, which is completely feasible given that tech has improved in the 9 years since bitcoin started. 
Whenever someone points this out, some monkey always writes some crap about gigabyte or terabyte blocks. ��������

@_date: 2017-12-16 09:02:48
Ah fair enough then.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:01:51
Segwit isn't being adopted though. 2mb is not "ginormous", and a hard fork would have been fine.
We are stuck with $20 transactions because we only have segwit. Absolute refusal for bigger blocks has capped how many people can use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:43:14
Sorry man. I hope you and your wife can find comfort in your love.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:21:25


Every man and his dog was saying it was an 'instant doubling' of capacity when it was getting rolled out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:53:54
I'd go eth, ltc, and btc. You can get all of them on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:05:08
Yeah, I can't afford transactions, and it's turning off newcomers. Not sure if that's a 'feature' of a constrained network.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:49:58
A network where blocks are persistently full and people are bidding $20 for space for a transaction is not scaling adequately to meet demand. A lightning network is pixie dust and won't do much at all to relieve the glut of transactions.
Keep telling yourself they only need another *18 months* to fix it.
The core lied when they said 2mb blocks will hurt decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:51:32
Spend your own money you scab.

I have a large stake in their coin which is used to fund the development. They become significantly poorer overnight if a large swath of the community decides to leave. Keeping users on board is definitely in their interest.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:51:45
Yeah good point mate ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:32


Those features are completely academic when we've got a network that costs $20 per transaction. All it would have taken would be to Core to have supported segwit2x for an actual capacity doubling. The crypto world moves fast and bitcoin is currently extremely slow. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:58
If bitcoin launched in its current state this year no one would poke a stick at it. Unbelievable fees, slow confirmations, mempool backlog which will probably take weeks to clear...
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:49
You already have real money. GBP are slave dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:13:02

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:03:34
It's an instant doubling.... *But only if users and corporations do XYZ...*
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:29:51
Holy shit. I just read through your past comments. All you do is make arbitrary and specific demands for sources.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:10:05
Eth performed over 1million transactions yesterday. It's not crippled. Litecoin already has twice the capacity of bitcoin, and it won't show strain if it were to get the transaction volume that BTC is currently receiving.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:50
They made their statement when they said no to 2mb blocks. That was a real scaling solution which would have given an instant capacity boost. Saying no because 'it would hurt decentralisation' was a terrible lie.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:01:25
What's your point? Can't have a positive opinion of another coin without being a shill?
You know darknet markets will be accepting bcash because bitcoin is no longer economical for payments?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:15
I'm not 'shitting myself', there were heaps of posts speaking about how it was an effective immediate doubling of network capacity, but mainly from people who were uninformed on what it actually does. That's the truth, and you know it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:43:42
Lightning network won't help scaling any more than segwit currently is. Don't get your hopes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:13
Tbh I'd just re-buy. You'd still be up a shitload, and sometimes it doesn't hit the same levels.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:29


They were last year :(
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:12:30
You suggested the fees will be exactly 8x less with 8x bigger blocks. That's just wrong. How else did you come up with such a ridiculous statement?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:13

I'm not a shill, I hold 85% btc. I can just recognise that the network is currently failing to do its job.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:03:18
I agree with you. LN is pixie dust that may not make a difference, and in the time it becomes available 'only 18 months', newcomers will have gone to coins which actually have affordable and quick transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:36:15
Segwit2x would have provided an instant boost in capacity :(
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:51:35

@_date: 2017-12-11 13:14:52
I have a far greater stock of btc than ltc. But if I only had $100 to spend hoping for a 'moonshot' I would pick ltc. It literally doubled a couple days ago, and has outperformed btc this year. It hasn't hit the same technical barriers as btc and has far lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:40:16
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:32:11
Yeah, but when that happens, bcash will be supporting more users than Bitcoin can. Bitcoin is going to remain a niche product until it is viable for more users.
When the 8mb blocks fill, bcash will be supporting about 8x more transactions than Bitcoin currently can.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:05:49

Translation: hey man. it's not cores fault that they have taken years to implement a tiny capacity upgrade while the ecosystem has exploded. roger and jihan are evil and have obviously prevented them from doing anything. plz don't criticise the weaknesses of bitcoin. $10 transactions are a part of sathoshis plan. it hurts my confidence in my investment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:21:26
*18 months* lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:10
Do you think a modest increase in blocksize would actually affect scaling that much?? Going from 1mb blocks to 2mb would have doubled capacity and only costed marginally more for full nodes to run.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:22:43
I would fucking love for either of you guys to be right, but I just can't imagine it :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:17:07

Either way he's in heaven lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:13:15
Yeah, they are wrong. Congestion has only gotten worse since segwit was activated, and only 10% or so of transactions are segwit. Doubling would mean twice as many transactions can be processed, and this could have been achieved months ago if Core weren't so arrogant. That is not marginal and would go a long way in solving our current issues.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:42
Bittrex stole my baby! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:51:39

Brah you wrote a paragraph over a semantics issue on reddit. The total number of circulating bitcoins has never been worth more, even if it's not exactly $15B. That tends to be referred to as the market cap because it's a familiar term. The website I used, and many others haven’t taken issue with that terminology, even if you do.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:08:14

Bitcoin has a 88% capitalisation of all the currencies. It is the oldest, and the most stable, most widely recognised and accepted. It is something I am interested in, and I posted in the bitcoin sub, not somewhere else trying to pump it.
Stop trying to conflate it with a toy because you haven't had the insight to invest earlier. I have had money sitting in BTC for years, if I wanted instant gratification I would have gone to a casino.

@_date: 2016-12-23 05:16:03
Stopped thinking about it. Decided I wouldn't be too bothered if I lost the money, but still anticipated it would rocket up sooner or later. It's not worth the stress of having money in bitcoin that would affect your life dramatically if you lost it.

Assuming you need $1,000,000 to retire on, the current price of bitcoin would have to increase 10000-fold, so each bitcoin would be worth $40,000,000... Does that seem realistic to you?

@_date: 2016-12-28 02:13:21
Anyone who compares bitcoin to beanie babies, tulips, or tiny crypto-currencies which have no functional uses is either really misinformed or is just trying to smear it. Beanie babies are cute toys, but are not useful. My understanding is that their price collapsed because their producer increased production then retired some lines.
I have used bitcoin to purchase things that I can't do with conventional money, or where I haven't wanted a purchase linked to my identity. If you have bought bitcoin just to see it appreciate, congratulations. If you have bought it to use it for purchases, congratulations also.
I've been involved in bitcoin for over 4 years. I have made money and lost money. I have followed this sub and other outlets really closely. I made this post in the bitcoin sub, I do not try and promote it outside here or in my own personal circles. I have not promoted it like a pyramid scheme, I just noted a milestone, no matter how arbitrary it may be.
I have never said it is a shoe-in, it is anything but that. It is a high-risk, but potentially high-reward investment. If it goes to zero tomorrow my lifestyle won't change at all. I didn't put in more than I can afford to lose. I would discourage anyone putting more money in than they can afford to lose. [This behaviour]( disgusts me as much as I think it would disgust you. If my bitcoin holdings go to zero I will still be able to have a laugh and benefit from everything I have learnt.
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:55:47
About a few days just because of the delay in getting the money. It 'clicked' pretty quick. Saw the story about how Bitcoin had soared with the Greek troubles in 2013 but had since crashed. I couldn't believe how much it had appreciated since the last time I read about it in NewScientist (in 2011?). Cashed out of some more traditional investments and put it straight into BTC. Despite the ups and downs I'm still comfortably hodling.

Thanks for your reply. 
I used to host a full node in 2014, and I plan on doing it again on my rasp pi before this year is out. I just don't see how 1mb blocks is reasonable, but what line people are drawing as *beyond reasonable*. Is there a similar line people think is suitable for transaction costs? $5 is okay, but $50 isn't?
Do you think that a 2mb block size would overly restrict who is able to host a full node?
Running a full node is nowhere near the limits of technology. Blockchain total size is 140gb for 9 years worth of transactions. LN is still years away, and blocksize can be changed at any time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:05:07
The core were invited to NYA but declined to go. That basically says all you need to know about them.
NYA was a compromise project and Core couldn't even grace it with their presence. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:15:00
To me it just feels like Core is being oppositional. Core outright refused to attend the NYA meeting. I am yet to see any convincing reasons that 2mb block will have any significant adverse effect on decentralisation. I am worried that their decision to keep 1mb blocks is more about maintaining control of 'the bitcoin', rather than adapting to the changing landscape.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:58:39

If you and your wife are as bad with money as you suggest, and she doesn't like her job. You can bet the money you make from selling coins won't last long enough to significantly improve your situation.
I don't know the relationship between you and your wife. But there are lots of stories of people getting pressured to sell btc to pay off spouse's debts, or waste the money on crap. Then the relationship falls apart.
I wouldn't sell a solely owned pre-marital asset to buy a shared house. You are effectively betting half your btc money that she won't leave you.
Not many people have the self control you do to sit on the coins for so long. A lot of people see btc as free money and think it's worth selling immediately after it appreciates. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:40:50

@_date: 2017-11-07 13:13:47
Core are making themselves redundant, and bitcoin more vulnerable to competitors. They have had years to innovate and improve bitcoin for end users. I have had bitcoin for over 4 years, and it has never been worse to use than now. The current $5-$10 had been an impending reality for years and they've just sat on their hands.
People's transactions aren't spam, and outbidding eachother for space on the network is bullshit.

Can you please explain the 'big picture' to me. I've been hodling since 2013 and I've run a full node before. Now I'm paying over $5 for transactions because demand for transaction space exceeds the supply. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:46:34
Not wanting to pay $5 for a transaction is a pretty mainstream use case. It's as if the core and their trolls are enjoying watching bitcoin become more shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:23:01


Yeah those fees are also an incentive for people to just use a different crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:21:24
Yeah, and with the improvements in computer specs, internet connectivity, and data storage costs, I don't see why some kind of minor increase in block size would hurt decentralisation. Only thing I ever hear about is the perceived steep slope arguments, like Andreas discussing petabyte blocks in his talk.
I would rather pay to maintain a full node than spend money outbidding others for on-chain transactions.

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:43:50

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:32:31
Core are playing the market with their laughable scaling solutions that never manage to match demand. Whenever they don't develop something it suddenly 'lacks consensus'. They were invited to the NYA but refused. They couldn't even compromise to segwit2x. Now we're stuck with $5 transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:21:05
Bitcoin currently sucks as a payment method and 2mb blocks would alleviate this. Computers are constantly improving and we're being bottlenecked by Core and their supporters arguing that not every African farmer would be able to host a full node on their smartphone. All while we're paying $5 transactions.
1mb or 8mb blocks will affect usability and but it won't drastically affect how many people can host a node. 'Optimisation' like segwit is giving us diminishing returns.

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:14:54

@_date: 2017-04-12 07:54:18
It will always affect the pump, but this is relevant to bitcoin as we try to get segwit implemented.
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:27:48
There haven't been any software changes in years allowing for greater transaction capacity.

Yeah, segwit. Only needs 95% of miners signalling before it gets activated. That seems really likely.....
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:54:42
Muh $120 billion network which can handle 1mb of transactions every 10 minutes....
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:09:10
All it takes is 5% of mining power to prevent segwit happening. It will not be because of miners lagging to upgrade, but rather them choosing not to.
Devs could have patched this years ago before it became an issue and before they had competition... But here we are....

Bitcoin is already a success, but other coins can transmit money faster and cheaper. It'd be great if bitcoin also had the capacity for that. Bitcoin taking less than 3 days for a bank transfer is a poor comparison.
You're trying to make something out of nothing. Other cryptos don't need huge caps to do this. The current litecoin cap is where bitcoin was a few years ago. Your original comment that no other caps are big compared to bitcoin is arbitrary and completely unrelated to the point.

You've taken to the extreme a situation that I doubt you understand at all. 
I was referring to substance use disorder which has a medical definition and criteria dsm-5. You can look it up if it interests you, and you will see it only applies to drugs/etoh. 
These people are spending their government welfare money on drugs and alcohol. Restricting peoples access to buying drugs and alcohol from tax payer funded welfare is hardly fascism.
Are you seriously comparing that to slavery?

Yeah, you can only buy so many groceries though, and the research so far says it's working. The people on welfare in the communities trialled are really sad cases, and lack the motivation to spend this money improving their own lives. Restricting their money means it's not going to crack dealers as easily.

Craig’s favourite place as a kid was his grand­father’s basement, a paradise of early computing. His family say Ronald Lyman received the first degree awarded by the Marconi School of Wireless in Australia, and served in the army as a signals officer. They also say he later became a spy.
Lyman had an old computer terminal and a Hayes 80-103A modem that was used to connect to the University of Melbourne’s network. To keep Craig quiet while he worked, Pop, as the children called him, would let him write code. “I found this community of hackers,” Wright says, “and I worked out how to interact with them. I started building games and hacking other people’s games. In time, I’d be pulling apart hacker code, and eventually I did this for companies, to help them create defences against hackers.”
His mother, when I met her in Brisbane in March 2016, told me he was sometimes picked on at school. “He struggled,” she said, “but after a while I sent him to Padua College” — a Catholic boys’ school in Brisbane — “and he shone there. I mean, he was different. He used to dress up and he had an obsession with Japanese culture. He had big samurai swords.”
When he was 18, Wright joined the air force. “They locked me in a bunker,” he told me, “and I worked on a bombing system. Smart bombs. We needed fast code, and I did that.” When he was in his 20s a melanoma appeared on his back and he had several skin grafts. “This was after he got out of the air force,” his mother told me, “and when he recovered he was off to university, and it’s been degrees, degrees, degrees since then.” He went to the University of Queensland to study computer systems engineering. And over the following 25 years he would finish, or not finish (or finish and not do the graduation paperwork for) degrees in digital forensics, nuclear physics, theology, management, network security, international commercial law and statistics. After our first full interview, he went home to work on an assignment for a new course he was taking at the University of London, a masters in quantitative finance.
The question of how to take Bitcoin forward has been riven with opposing views, and after Satoshi disappeared in 2011 there was no central authority to lead the discussion or calm the waters. By increments, the task fell to Gavin Andresen, a Princeton graduate with experience in Silicon ­Valley. Andresen only gradually accepted the role of lead core Bitcoin developer. This is not an official designation and he appears to have got none of the thanks and all the flak, but by general ­consensus he is the most level-headed thinker in the Bitcoin world.
Andresen had been in touch with Satoshi in the early days and would have records of their conversations. He would presumably be able to ask Wright questions that only Satoshi could answer. In December 2015, after Wired published the story about Wright possibly being Satoshi, Andresen told the magazine he’d never heard of Craig Wright. But he began to believe in Wright once he started corresponding with him by email in early April. Within a week, Andresen was sufficiently convinced to get on a plane to London. He was ready to see Wright sign a message to him using the original Satoshi cryptographic keys.
It was late one afternoon when Wright, in the presence of Matthews and MacGregor, finally logged on to his laptop to do for Andresen what he had already done for me in a proof session at his home: sign a message with the key and have it verified. At that point, Andresen reached over to his bag and took out a brand-new USB stick and removed it from its wrapping. He took out his own laptop. “I need to test it on my computer,” he said.
Wright suddenly baulked. “I had vowed,” he told me, “never to show the key publicly and never to let it go. I trusted Andresen, but I couldn’t do it.” Matthews’ blood ran cold. “It was the only time during all the years that I thought: ‘Jesus Christ, has he been spinning us the whole time?’”
MacGregor, too, felt this was a very risky moment. He glanced at Matthews. They all felt Wright’s behaviour was ludicrous: he’d demonstrated that he was Satoshi and only had to let this be verified on Andresen’s laptop. End of story. But Wright spoke to me later in a way that showed his cypherpunk suspicion had reared its head: What if Andresen was a plant? What if the whole thing was a plot to rob him of Satoshi’s keys and exploit him or deny him?
Then, a compromise. A brand new laptop was purchased and Wright demonstrated, again, that he held Satoshi’s private key.
May 2, 2016. The day of reckoning, the day the media could name Satoshi. At 8am, Wright posted a blog about himself as Satoshi. At the same moment, Gavin Andresen posted a message to his blog, titled “Satoshi”. “I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin,” it began. By midday the blog was receiving the wrong sort of attention. A number of researchers had studied what Wright had written and noticed that the explanation was fudged — worse than fudged, it was faked. Something that he said was signed with the Satoshi key had, in fact, been cut and pasted from an old, publicly available signature associated with Nakamoto. It was astonishing and the buzz quickly grew fierce.
Wright must have known, having been a cryptographer all his adult life, that his fraud would be spotted immediately. But when I asked him about it he said it wasn’t a fraud, it was a mistake. “I cut and pasted something just for the time being but knew I would change it later,” he said. “But then it went up.” That rang hollow to me. I believed at that point that he had misled his colleagues and tried to get out of being Satoshi, which isn’t necessarily the same thing as not being him.
The next day, I turned up at MacGregor’s office and found him sitting with Matthews in a dark meeting room. MacGregor said they were going to “flood the blog with evidence” and get Wright to transfer some of the Satoshi Bitcoin in a way that only someone in possession of Satoshi’s private keys could do. Over the next 24 hours, Wright agreed to move Satoshi’s Bitcoin and his blog advertised the fact. It said, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof” and he was set to provide it.
The next day, May 4, Matthews was at Wright’s house organising the movement of Bitcoin to Andresen and also to a BBC journalist. The new (and final) proof session was intended to blow away the doubts, but many felt it was too late. Wright was worried about a security flaw in the early blockchain that would make it risky for him to move Bitcoin, exposing him to exploitation or theft. My sources later said Andresen understood the problem and confirmed it had been fixed. But Wright continued to worry and showed great reluctance about offering the final proof. Then he left the room abruptly and didn’t come back.
The next day, he sent me an email. It linked to an article headlined “UK law enforcement sources hint at impending Craig Wright arrest”. The article suggested that the father of Bitcoin might be liable, under the Terrorism Act, for the actions of people who used Bitcoin to buy weapons. Under the link, Wright had written an explanation: “I walk from 1 billion [dollars] or I go to jail. I never wanted to be out, but if I prove it, they destroy me and my ­family. I am the source of terrorist funds as Bitcoin creator or I am a fraud to the world. At least a fraud is able to see his family. There is nothing I can do.”
I am still not sure if Wright was faking his fear of the FBI. He’d never mentioned them to me before, and there seemed little evidence they were seeking to arrest him. Indeed they never have.
That afternoon, he closed down the blog — the one that was intended to lead cryptocurrency fans into a new era — but left a final posting: “I’m sorry. I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot. When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this. I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me … I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.”
MacGregor, Matthews and Andresen still believe he is Satoshi. To them, there is just too much evidence to accept Wright’s late attempt at deniability. But no matter. “The world is still going to think we got fooled, but I know the facts. He has the keys,” MacGregor told me.
Wright wanted to meet. It was a few weeks after the abortive “reveal” and I saw when I got to the cafe that he was happy again and ready to take on the world. He had lost a third share in a billion dollars but he felt unburdened. He was sorry to have let good people down but now he could work in peace.

@_date: 2017-06-24 13:23:31
One of the things I’d noticed during my times with him was that Wright hated claiming outright to be Satoshi and would spend hours giving credit to everyone who had ever contributed. It was odd: he was coming out as Satoshi, yet the claim embarrassed him and I have many hours of tape in which he deflects it. “Do you want to know what I think?” I said to him that day in the cafe. “What if you were 30 per cent Satoshi. You were there at its formation and you were part of a brilliant group. You coded and you synthesised other people’s work and you shared in the encryption keys. Then, sometime in the last year, you upgraded yourself to 80 or 90 per cent. You were already a lot more Satoshi than anybody else has been hitherto, but the deal, in your eyes, required you to be more and in the end you couldn’t carry that off.”
“No,” he said. And he flew off on a tangent about elliptical curves and the nature of the blockchain and how he never wanted to be a deity. I turned off my recorder at that point and stared through him.
Outside the cafe, he shook my hand. I knew I would never see him again. What he actually did may never be known. Either he’s one of the ­greatest computer scientists of his generation, or he’s a reckless opportunist, or he’s both.

Ten men raided a house in Gordon, a north shore suburb of Sydney, at 1.30pm on December 9, 2015. Some of the federal agents wore shirts that said Computer Forensics; one carried a search warrant. They were looking for a man named Craig Steven Wright (pictured above, last year), who lived with his wife, Ramona, in St Johns ­Avenue. The warrant was issued at the behest of the tax office. Wright, a computer ­scientist and businessman, headed a group of companies ­associated with crypto-currency and online ­security. But he and his wife were gone, and the agents entered the house by force.
As one set of agents scoured his cupboards and emptied out his garage, another entered Wright’s main company HQ in nearby North Ryde. They were looking for originals or copies of material held on hard drives and computers; they wanted bank statements, mobile phone records, research papers and photographs. The warrant listed ­dozens of companies whose papers were to be scrutinised, and 32 individuals. The name “Satoshi Nakamoto” appeared sixth from the bottom.
Some of the Wrights’ neighbours say Ramona was friendly but her husband was weird — to one he was “Cold-Shoulder Craig” — and their landlord wondered why they needed so much extra power: Wright had what appeared to be a whole room full of generators at the back of the property. This fed a rack of computers he called his “toys”; he had taken them away the day before the raid. A reporter had turned up at the house and Wright, alarmed, had phoned ­Stefan, the man advising them on what he and Ramona were ­calling “the deal”. Stefan immediately moved the couple into a luxury apartment in Sydney’s CBD. They would soon be ­moving to England anyway, and all parties agreed it was best to hide out for now.
On December 9, after their first night in the new apartment, Wright woke to the news that two articles, one on the website Gizmodo, the other in the tech magazine Wired, had come out overnight fingering him as the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who in 2008 had published a paper describing a “peer-to-peer ­electronic cash system” — a technology Satoshi went on to develop as Bitcoin. Reading the articles on his laptop, Wright knew his old life was over.
Technology is constantly changing the lives of people who don’t really understand it — we drive our cars and care nothing for internal combustion — but now and then a story will break that captures the imagination of the general public. I was one of the people who had never heard of Satoshi Nakamoto or the blockchain — the invention underlying Bitcoin, which verifies transactions without the need for any central authority. It was news to me that this was the biggest thing in computer science, and that the banks were grabbing onto the blockchain as the foundation of a future “internet of value”. But to those who are much more invested in the world of tomorrow, the Satoshi story has the lineaments of a modern morality tale quite independent of stock realities.
A few weeks before the raid on Wright’s house, when his name still hadn’t ever been ­publicly ­associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, I got an email from a US lawyer called Jimmy Nguyen, looking to ­contract me to write a biography of Nakamoto. “My client has acquired life story rights from the true person behind the pseudonym Satoshi ­Nakamoto, the creator of the Bitcoin protocol,” he wrote. “The story will be [of] great interest to the public and we expect the book project will generate ­significant publicity and media coverage once Satoshi’s true identity is revealed.” Journalists, it turned out, had spent years looking for ­Nakamoto, who had disappeared in 2011. His identity was one of the great mysteries of the internet and a holy grail of investigative reporting.
I wanted to be careful. I had to find out exactly what these clients were looking for and why they’d come to me. This information came slowly, and I let the deal remain vague; I signed nothing while I worked out who they were.
The “Stefan” who was hovering during the raid on Craig Wright’s house and office is Stefan ­Matthews, an Australian IT expert whom Wright had known for 10 years since they both worked for the online gambling site Centrebet. In those days, around 2007, Wright was often hired as a security analyst by such firms, deploying his skills as a computer scientist (and his experience as a hacker) to make life difficult for fraudsters. Wright was an eccentric guy, Matthews remembered, but known to be a reliable freelancer. He told me that in 2008 Wright had asked him to look at a ­document written by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto, but Matthews had been busy at the time and didn’t read it for a while. He said that Wright was always trying to get him interested in this new venture called Bitcoin.
A few years later, however, Matthews realised the document he’d been shown was, in fact, an original draft of the famous white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. (Like the governments they despise, bitcoiners deal — when it comes to ideas — in “white papers”, as if they were issuing laws.)
By 2015, Wright was in financial trouble: a number of businesses he had founded were ­failing, and he was embroiled in a dispute with the ATO. By then, Matthews had become friendly with Robert MacGregor, the boss of a ­Canada-based money-transfer firm called nTrust. ­Matthews encouraged MacGregor to come to Australia and assess Wright’s value as an investment opportunity. Matthews told ­MacGregor that Wright was almost certainly the man behind Bitcoin.
The maths behind the technology can be mind-boggling, but essentially Bitcoin is a form of digital money in which the flow and the integrity of the currency is guaranteed by its appearance on a shared public ledger, updated and refreshed with every ­single transaction, a “public history” that cannot be corrupted by any single entity. It works by consensus and is secured by a series of private and public encryption keys. Blockchain technology is a hot topic in computer science and ­banking at the moment, and hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested in such ideas. Thus ­Matthews’ proposal. MacGregor came to Australia in May 2015, and after initial scepticism struck a deal with Wright the following month.
MacGregor says he felt sure that Wright was Bitcoin’s legendary missing father, and he told me it was his idea, later in the drafting of the deal, to insist that Satoshi’s “life story rights” be included as part of the agreement. The plan was to take Wright to London, set up a research and development centre for him and complete the work on his inventions and patent applications — and the whole lot would be sold as the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, who would be unmasked as part of the project. Once packaged, Matthews and MacGregor planned to sell the intellectual property for upwards of a billion dollars. Wright would prove he was Satoshi by using cryptographic keys that only Satoshi had access to — those associated with the very first blocks in the blockchain.
At this point, nobody knew who Craig Wright was but he appeared, from the initial evidence, to have a better claim to being Satoshi Nakamoto than anyone else had. He seemed to have the technical ability. He also had the right social ­history, and the timeline worked. The big proof was up ahead, and how could it not be specta­cular? It was then, four weeks after my first meeting with MacGregor, that Wired and ­Gizmodo reported that he might be Satoshi.
 
Craig Wright’s father, Frederick Page Wright, was a forward scout in Vietnam, serving with the 8th Battalion of the Australian Army. “He lost all his friends,” Wright told me when we eventually started meeting in London, “every single one of them” — and before long he was drinking and Wright’s mother eventually left him.

Brah. Those are 2 completely unrelated things. That said you're in a fantastic position to improve your life without the financial hinderances most people your age face. You are in the financial 1% of people in your age group.
I was in your situation when I was 22. I hit the gym, ate well, worked on myself, and got on tinder. Not saying it will work for you, but my experience has always been that self improvement will draw good people to you.
