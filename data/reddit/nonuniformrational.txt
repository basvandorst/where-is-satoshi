As someone that got goxxed for, this is starting to feel familiar. I doubt it is the same but do be wary people. 
Don't trust exchanges even if they are the biggest most trusted. 
Edit, seeing all the comments now, something shady is going on. Something is being hidden.

For many outside the US there were no alternatives until quite recently.
 And most of the new routes in still seem really sketchy. Mtgox was a tried and tested route in. 
A lot of people got caught when they would change the level of verification need to take out btc. When I signed up no verification was needed initially. But when I tried to get out I needed to be verified to withdraw btc. No email was sent to me by gox, only logging on would tell me. Tried to get verified before they halted withdrawals but it didn't get verified in time. Didn't lose too much. Was keeping a small amount there with intention to trade with but my day trading just turned into holding.
People easily forget what bitcoin exchanges looked like just a year ago. And people in the US have no idea how inconvenient buying is for the rest of us.

Really describes reddit as a whole. Seems to happen to every community on reddit... Probably because the main page for new users is a bag of unimportant shite. So it attracts the non intellects unfortunately.

I think she regrets missing out on making a shit ton of money, rather than getting into bitcoin.

Yeah I'm not sure why anyone would use it for longterm storage of large amounts when there is a free alternative. But I was mainly talking about buying in not storing. There hasn't been many other routes to buy in until recently. Storing has always had multiple solutions.

It's legit, just been down there.

Until fairly recently their hasn't been much choice in exchanges, especially if your trying to put money in from  outside of the US. They were the only tried and tested option for a lot of people, no one wants to be a guinea pig and use something even more unknown than gox. They had a route of payment (in) that seemed to work. In the UK its still a nightmare to buy in but they had the simplest method for quite some time. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 11:08:23
Exactly, they could easily become 'on street' exchanges, it would be mutually beneficial for Western union and for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:30:12
They've now got 1.2btc, some sweet wrappers, a few MTG cards, .2 grams of pocket fluff and an expired bus pass. Can we all share it all out evenly?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:43:32
Yeah they have no way of enforcing it but I doubt they really care, other wise you would have to set up an account with them before using the ATM and I checked, you don't.
 It really is very simple, I didn't buy but the dude walked me through it and it seems very legit.  8% doesn't really sound too bad, obviously I would like it to be cheaper, but 8% is nothing in btc you could make it back in a few days if done right.  
You can wait weeks for transfers with banks and  then risk using a dodgy exchange, bank fees, the risk of non return in faliure. This is blam... 10 seconds... to the moon. 
The More I think about it, the more I'm convinced that this will actually be quite a huge entry point to BTC in the UK.

It would be good to choose charities that help people/areas that unscrupulous investment from traditional banking has had the most negative effect. 
We could 'brand' the donations as a direct retaliation to the major banks etc.
E.g. 'This donation drive is going toward victims of drug cartels in Mexico to help counter the past investments/laundering of HSBC'
(maybe a bad example, but along those lines)
A) It would help people in genuine need.
B) The BTC community would donate more as it is having a poke at the establishment.
If btc or similar becomes the core of the new economy, it would be great to see it redistributing wealth/equality better than the current system.

Yeah presumably addresses, I might have not thought it through while i was writing.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:44:46
Just went there, totally legit. Nice guy who owns it.  It's 8percent. Limited to 1000quid  per wallet per month. edit: (actually per customer, but can only be enforced by wallet) 
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:03:47
Don't quote me, but I think the guy said it was based off bitpay rate. 
 
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:23:56
You will 'have' to declare it to Job Seekers, and they might reduce any allowance, if you can claim it at 16 that is.  
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:14:41
They also own Play.com in the UK, which is one of the biggest online retailers. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:19:02
Take cash for btc only, £1000 quid per customer (actually per wallet a month).

Just pasting what I put a few comments up.  I went there earlier.


















Edit: I think Bitpay is what they base their price on.

I'm not specifically talking about the current Tories or Cameron but much longer spans of time than just one generation of a party. You have made leaps of speculation into what I have written.
In the past there has been a lot more aggressive pro globalization and currently it is more out of favour in the mainstream, as the electorate becomes more diverse than just the big 2. The parties can't afford to rock the boat with so much growing support being seen for UKIP, agreed. 
I see pro-globalisation in the media at an all time low at the moment. But it does exist as a long term agenda for **some** people, just as the inverse is true. Those people aren't going to always succeed at positively promoting globalism. But if they think it is a good idea they will continue to lobby for it.
Unifying currencies, is a consistent theme in globalisation there are thousands of references to it if you search. 
I'm not saying that David Cameron is going to introduce a one world currency. 
But anyone can see you that the value of work is stabilizing across the world. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:21:17
Why? It's the natural conclusion of globalisation. For Certain think-tanks and NGOs, promoting aspects of globalisation is their main goal. Others are against it But it **is** certainly an agenda that some influential people like to fund.

Great pub too.

Yeah this is what is going on in the long game, the currencies are conveniently merging. The system is completely rigged. The people have come up with an alternative solution. The powers that be will do all they can to hold on to 'their' system.
 
The UK is the centre of banking and the banks, government (and the people) stand to loose a lot if they cant continue to be the funnel of the worlds economy. (a rigged funnel!)
