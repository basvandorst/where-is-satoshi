Kind of random but I live in Oregon and recently tried to use Gemini to trade BTC but it is not offered here. Any recommendations for a site that is more instant than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:45:21
the coin I have now I got a few weeks back, I am still pretty new to this. I would just like to get more before it is way way too late 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:32:44
I'm curious what people think the effect of interest rate hike tomorrow will be? I understand it may have little to no effect at all.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:36:43
This makes it sound like you think even if it fails right now it wont drop below 1250.... is that true?
 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:35:29
Thank you so much for the advice! I will definitely set up a more scheduled buy post ETF decision. I have it on coinbase right now and is that a " party"? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:01:28
I use coinbase too and to buy using my bank account there is like an 8 day wait. The credit card is fast but the max buy is way lower and the fee is higher. IS there a way to by at the small fee instant and still be able to buy a few thousand worth?
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:52:36
Thanks again for breaking this down for a noob. Really do appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:34:50
so what exactly is the alternative to these third arty sites?
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:54:57
where do I sign up?
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:43:30
I'm very new here but I always thought that bitcoin was intended to be a decentralized currency. I believe that if transactions are not fast, practically instant, it will never bee widely accepted currency. I also think major fees also destroys the dream of having this be what I am paid by my employer and use to buy my coffee. Do you disagree with this?  
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:29:30
Thank you in advance for any advice. I am really starting to love this magical internet money.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:41:55
Well let me know. I just graduated college and am very new to the bitcoin/cryptocurrency thing but have been enjoying learning and splashing around in it.
And congrats on the potentially new boat!   
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:02:13
Awesome thank you for clarifying that. So is Sigwit a " lightening Network"?
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:01:20
Can you quickly explain the difference between on chain and off chain transactions? I'm guessing off chain would be like a coin base account to another coin base account..?

New York Agreement 
The signed agreement by some CEOs and miners to implement segwit2x BTC1

If it is true profit, then a lot of businesses could. I would not recommend many businesses who were not profitable before adding BTC, to add BTC and then hold much if not any of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:50:46
I would NOT recommend trying to time the market. I have learned that buying and HODLing is the best method.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:32:20
do you think it will drop that far? if so how come? I think a drop like that would set bitcoin back years for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:07:43
I bet in 5 years that bitcoin will be worth more than that gold ;)
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:49:11
I just made another purchase at 2120. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:05:28
This is proof that Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow. I just hope the politics and major players of Bitcoin don't ruin this for common users and early investors. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:08:59
I just bought a trezor off their site using bitcoin and it was half the price as amazon and came in 3 days.
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:03:53
There was a post like 5 before mine that said the SEC decision was not going to be today... but I don't have a true source so maybe it is still day... Have you heard otherwise?
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:36:23
With talk of a reasonable compromise I think that confidence is rising 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:07:26
I think you are right for the long term (two years) but you dont think that the idea of any kind of fork will deter new investors? and even drive some to other alt coins. Especially investors like me who dont know much about it. Correct me if I am wrong but i dont think a fork of any kind will result in a price increase (shorty term). If anything I would expect the price to drop until the side of the chain is chosen.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:35:52
loving this sale 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:19:16
Buy the dip
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:03:22
Could not agree with you more. If people want bitcoin to get mass adoption and head for the moon, now is the time! There has been great publicity recently and with the whole trump Russia thing Americans will start to lose confidence in the US dollar. Bitcoin needs to step up now!
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:04:45
I don't ever think it will replace the USD. Especially not in the near future, but it will coexist with it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:23:49
I could not agree more with this. I am still pretty new to the crypto currency world but when I first join I was all about BTC now with all this talk about chain splits an soft and hard forks (which as someone with a non technical background) I have started to switch to holding Ethereum because I feel it is safer. I really hope the BTC community figures it out though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:59:25
yes adding a little bit every month is very smart. Now is a good time to get started 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:28:06
HODLing to moon.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:00:01
I only care because I want Segwit for bitcoin. I have never actually been to that sub.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:33:48
So how do you see the scaling debate playing out? Do you support the UASF, the NY comprise, bigger blocks or some other solution? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:07:55
I think you are right. Do you know what day they are suppose to decide by?
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:25:41
They will be changing that title form bitcoin to some other alt coin if we dont scale here soon.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:43:54
USD. Since you are doing it as a fraction on your paycheck USD would make the most sense. This would allow you to coast average buy which will help to insure you can ride the bitcoin roller coaster with out feeling like you are losing everything on these price corrections.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:10:58
I bought it off  
This is their website right? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:24:11
do you know when that will be released? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:30:31
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:30:48
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:38:19
just hold and reevaluate in like 6 months 
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:14:34
I really hope this gets resolved before summer of 2018. With such political turmoil globally right now I think this is a great year for bitcoin to become more mainstream. In the long run you are probably right that this is just another "this is the end" fad. That being said if bitcoin does not figure it out this year I think a major dent will be made in its dominance which may never full recover 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:33:27
this is where I just ordered mine. 
As for how they work I am not your guy. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:13:00
while I 100% agree my statement is more geared toward the influx of new users and investors being spooked by this big drop. In the large scheme of things I agree this drop is just a sale, but to someone new and there are a lot of new people a drop that big would be a major turn off and I would see many people not returning to the market. So I hope this is the extent of the correction 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:35:10
no one is sure. don't just sell because someone says it will drop 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:30:08
If the merchant believes the value of BTC will go up in the long run they should accept now while it is "cheaper". Sure there may be bear markets that cost them some money in the short term but long run they will make more if BTC does become more accepted and rises in price. Early merchant acceptors of BTC have a lot to gain. Think of people how choose to accept BTC a year ago, if they even kept 25% as BTC and converted the rest their profits are much greater than someone who only accepted Fiat.

For the record I was not referring to his English but rather what it meant from a technical view point
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:19:58
Thank you. I thought something like this may be the reason but could not figure it out completely 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:35:04
Use Gdax if you are trying to go from BTC to USD without any fess. Use a limit order
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:00:00
after this summer this question will be answered.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:07:03
Best advice given yet
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:05:19
It usually takes the full time if not a little longer. Congrats!! and happy HODLING
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:51:19
That is changing in some places very fast. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:12:03
..... Any you recommend?
 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:43:34
Well put. That being said if you believe in BTC and what it can do/has potential to do than there is no bad time to buy if you plan on using and HODLing your BTC
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:57
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:18
100% agree with this if we scale, but as of right now there is no solution that is even close to having the support needed, which is very concerning. i hope we figure out because I will not be selling now, nor in the near future. HODL
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:58:25
Hopefully some kind of agreement can be made at that conference. For now all we can do is HODL
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:15:44
Too expensive now. The cost of electricity is more than the value of the bitcoin you mined.
