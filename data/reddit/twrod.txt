I was just able to reproduce it, and it wasn't during sign up for me either, but I did have to make a new account. I'm getting closer to debugging it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:55:44
Hi, CTO here. We plan to release the source, we realize that's an important part of building the trust, but we need to know that it's important for you too. The fact that you've posted that though lets me know that it is. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:03:59
CTO here. We send to your email address via Coinbase. From there, you can transfer your BTC to another wallet if you choose.
We like minimalism too, which is why we provide settings to hide the bars completely, giving you the full real-estate.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:39:43
CTO here. This is built on node-webkit, which is built on Chromium.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:43:40
The version we're showing people doesn't have any anonymity guarantees, but we're rethinking that in the current climate.
Right now, the encryption is server side due to business decisions (we don't store sensitive data, and never would without client-side encryption), but if people would like us to build an open-source, Tor-enabled, anti-fingerprinting, anti-traffic analysis service, then of course we'd do all encryption client-side, or not even store data.

Hi folks, CTO here. It would appear as though this release has a bug that crashes the browser during signup. I'm working to resolve this quickly, I apologize for the inconvenience.
Please upvote this comment so others can see this.

Hi there! 13.10 uses libudev.so.1, as opposed to libudev.so.0; our .deb post-installer is supposed to detect libudev.so.1 and make a symbolic link to libudev.so.0, but it doesn't always work. Can you run the following script and tell me the output?
    libudev1=`locate libudev.so.1 | grep -m1 'libudev.so.1$' || true`
    if [[ -n "$libudev1" ]]; then
      libdir=`dirname $libudev1`
      if test -L "$libdir/libudev.so.0"; then
        touch "$libdir/libudev.so.0"
      elif test -e "$libdir/libudev.so.0"; then
        touch "$libdir/libudev.so.0"
      else
        ln -s "$libudev1" "$libdir/libudev.so.0"
      fi
    fi
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:11:15
In addition to those things, we recognize that Tor doesn't cover all the holes. We also would want to build anti-fingerprinting technology, and anti-traffic analysis technology.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:08:19
The current browser isn't the privacy browser, we're trying to find out if that is what people want. If so, then it'll be client-side encryption, it will be open-source, and it will utilize Tor as well.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:00:34
CTO here. Agreed. All user data is already encrypted, and if people want us to go in the direction of Anonymous Browsing, then we'll provide even stronger guarantees that we're not spying on you and doing everything in our power to protect the user's right to anonymity.
We're not spying on you, but until I open source it, I realize that you only have my word.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:02:22
CTO here. Sorry that it's crashing, I think there may be a bug in the signup process. I'll see what I can do to fix that ASAP, but once you're using it, it's much more stable. I use it everyday and it hasn't crashed in months for me.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:27:51
Yes, that's actually what broke massively. Hope your email address is correct, because that's the one we'll be sending to!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:03:23
That seems to be a more than common problem. I'll be investigating it ASAP. Sorry for the inconvenience!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:28:01
Hi, CTO here. While your data is certainly safe with us (we currently don't even store passwords and form data!), the feedback on when it is safe is unfortunately one thing that isn't perfect at the moment. In the topbar, you can see if the site you're viewing is using HTTPS, but I haven't quite finished the "green/yellow/red" security notification for browsers that indicate the current state of the site you're viewing. Obviously you should be cautious, and if you want to be perfectly safe, then just use services that you don't log in to for the moment.
It is embarrassing that it isn't there yet despite all the effort I've put in to provide a secure environment, so this IS coming in a future update.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:58:12
Hm. All looks normal. Can I also get the output from the following command?
dir .cycle\current\
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:27:07
Sorry to hear that! We'll run more promotions in the future, but we have to make a system to automate this process for next time, so it'll be a little while before the next one. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:46:53
Hi, I just finished sending out BTC to the list of users that I have that registered (before 6:00 PM PST on 11/21/13) and opened Cycle. If you still haven't received any, send me an email at contact so I can verify your account. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:00:23
Sorry about that, we had some massive load. It looks like everything is back to working order. Please try again!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:30:16
Roger that. I'll make it so.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:41:00
Hi there! If you're using an Ubuntu that has Unity, you should be able to click the launcher icon in the upper left and see Cycle as a recently-added app. If not, type "Cycle" and it should show up.
If that doesn't work, please let me know what version of Ubuntu you're running so I can fix that problem.
To launch Cycle from the command line, type "cycle-launcher"
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:26:03
Unfortunately, it could extend into the weekend for many people. We don't want to disappoint you guys, but we WILL be keeping our word, you WILL get some BTC, but we ask that you be patient. We're _really_ behind, sorry to make you wait.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:37:05
Hi, we're experience massive traffic and things are breaking! Sorry, we're trying to get it resolved as soon as possible! No, you're not missing something, I need to change the wording of that error message.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:45:50
Wow, thank you for bringing this to my attention! That is a horrible oversight on my part, I'm sorry for that. I'll make sure that it works in the next version!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:17:09
Yes, Coinbase is able to send BTC via email address, you'll receive it shortly! Thanks for downloading!
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:22:45
CTO here. I've tested our Fedora binary on Arch Linux. It's running smoothly under GNOME with somewhat minimal additional requirements (eg, libgconf). Although it isn't required, I'd probably also make it "depend" on flashplugin. I'll see what I can do about making a simple installation package for Arch over the next couple of releases.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:30:13
Hi, I'm the CTO.
Great questions! These "apps" can be viewed as combination between tabs and bookmarks. Internally, the app has logic that groups together tabs that belong to it so they're listed as part of it (e.g., multiple Quora tabs will group together under the Quora app). Every app also has a "start" page that can be customized in the info menu. We like the open web, so while we have our marketplace, it's really just a nice index of commonly used web apps/services. There are several ways to create custom apps just for your own Cycle: type a URL in the search bar and hit "shift+enter" or select the "+ Add App" suggestion that is at the bottom of the search overlay.
That's not all though. Just last week, we finished the first version of our extension framework (very primitive, but it works), and included the functionality with our Pandora app. It's just a play/pause and a skip button, but we plan to include custom little extensions with apps to enhance the experience of services and eventually open it up to developers, of course :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:54:07
Terribly sorry that it's not showing up, I'll get that remedied ASAP. It's at:
EDIT: That didn't show up correctly. The correct path is:
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:53:21
Theoretically, there's no reason our linux builds shouldn't work on there. I just have no experience packaging for Arch. Arch is the next Linux distro that I want to add support for, just haven't gotten to it. If you know of a good tutorial on how to package for it, that'll help out a bunch!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:50:53
Hah! Yeah, I wouldn't believe it myself, but the newer instruction sets paired with the fabrication shrinks help immensely for the current release. Cheers!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:59:10
Thanks for the info, the installer is supposed to handle it, but I'll work the fix in!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:01:57
Thanks! Our apps are a simplified mixture of bookmarks, tabs, and extensions. Here's an explanation that I gave during our previous promotion, and I'll be putting it up on our FAQ later today:

Ok, it looks like everything is back to working order. Please try again!
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:43:05
We're aware of that issue. Sorry that it's so annoying (it definitely bugs us too), we're working toward fixing it, but the timeline is 6-8 weeks, unfortunately. We'll keep everyone posted on our progress.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:46:29
15? Wow! Hopefully it's not an antivirus software reporting a false positive. If you have antivirus software running, first disable it for the moment. Then what I need you to do is open a Windows command prompt and then type:
.cycle\Cycle.exe --debug
It will launch and do its thing. Hopefully Cycle launches, but if not, it should create a text file named "cycle_log.txt" in your user directory (C:\Users\yourusername\cycle_log.txt). Please either post the contents here or email the file to me at: tim at cycleapplications dot com
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:06:59
Hmm, yeah it might very well be the proxy. Thanks for the info, I'll get to work on testing with proxies!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:27
Hi, thanks for downloading. I'm the CTO, let's see if we can get you up and running. What version of Windows are you running, and how many times have you tried launching it?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:04:25
Sorry about that, we had some massive load. It looks like everything is back to working order. Your account should have been created, try logging in.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:13:43
Yes! Our email system is down, but we're sending out the BTC manually. Hang tight, you'll get it eventually!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:35:38
Hi, we're experience massive traffic and things are breaking! Sorry, we're trying to get it resolved as soon as possible!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:22:57
Hi there! We're built on Chromium, so your data is as safe as in Chrome. Right now, we don't even save form data and passwords because I wanted to make sure that our process for saving your personal data is even more secure than Chrome's. We're continuing to work to give the best user experience possible without compromise.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:34:21
It does! It has a mini-beach-ball of death + mini cursor. It shows up on Cycle boot-up, but not during page loads. I'll get that fixed ;)
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:32:48
The forward and back buttons disappear completely when there's no forward history or back history, respectively. If you are clicking on them and nothing's happening, please file a support ticket on  letting me know which site(s) it's not working on. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:29:35
Yes, we do plan on open-sourcing this in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:57:00
What was the error message that displayed when you typed "cycle-launcher"? Also make sure that you have the proper .deb package that supports your architecture (i386 or amd64). Our download page should highlight the right architecture to download for your machine.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:57:46

@_date: 2013-11-21 21:40:20
we're experiencing massive traffic and things are breaking! Sorry, we're trying to get it resolved as soon as possible! And that's a problem with my error message, sorry about that, I'll make sure to change it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:51:22
Thanks for downloading! You'll get it through the email that you signed up with, so be sure it's a valid one! Coinbase facilitates this. If you don't want to keep it in Coinbase, then you can transfer it to another wallet at your leisure.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:12:46
Yes, you'll be able to add games! We'll add a couple to the marketplace over the weekend.
We got a hug of death from the deluge of signups, so our email system is down. We're manually sending the BTC to people's emails, so just hang tight, we'll get to you!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:32:04
Hah, good point. We already did get a couple $5 bonuses because people bought a BTC through Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:05:02
Sorry about that, I put in some locks to prevent it from working on non-Ubuntu, non-Linux Mint, and non-Fedora distros. We just don't have the capacity to support more distros at this time.
If you really want it to try it out on Squeeze, I'll take off the lock in the next version, but it hasn't been tested, and we can't officially support it yet. :(
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:27:19
Normally yes, but our email confirmation system broke, so you won't be getting confirmation emails. You will get BTC, but we're WAAAAY behind in the queue.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:31:58
Thanks for the feedback! You're right, it is the perfect time :)
Very perceptive! While the core of the browser is built on Chromium, the interface is actually HTML/JS/CSS. We're continuing to improve performance with it and we'll also consider making it look more like the OS-native design so it isn't as jarring. Eventually, we'll use native code to integrate perfectly, but that comes at the expense of being able to iterate quite as quickly.
We definitely have plans to make the dock more interactive like you mention, but I can't give a timeline on it, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:57:26
We do! It seems like everything is back to normal though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:56:02
Ok, it looks like everything is back to working order. Please try again!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:30:55
Hi, I'm the CTO. Not officially, yet, since we don't speak Laywer. But we hate privacy invasions as much as you guys do. Your data is your own, and we ACTUALLY delete it when you ask. We also don't sell your data and we will fight tooth and nail to keep it that way. In addition, all stored data is encrypted with AES-256.
Edit: Also, all inter-server communication is encrypted.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:26:09
Hi, thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately, it's only going to get worse in the future since we'll be fully-utilizing Chromium's multi-process architecture. But we will rename them to Cycle Browser.exe at least :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:55:14
Open up a terminal and type the following command and send me the output either on pastebin or tim (assuming that you've installed to your Applications folder):

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:39:29
Thanks, hope you enjoy it! If you have any specific ideas of how to do that, let me know on our feature request page: 
We'll be upgrading the rendering engine in a few releases also, so it'll be even faster then. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:54:58
Sorry, our confirmation email system is down, so you won't get a confirmation. We'll be sending BTC to it though, so that can act as a verification email ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:36:54
Also, AOL? :) I'll see if I can't make it a bit more unique, then. We're coming out with some cool stuff soon that will give it a bit more personality.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:05:11
Thanks for the feedback!
We're going to be revamping that behavior in the next release or so to fix the choppiness.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:52:52
Sorry for the wait, part of our system went down this afternoon, and we're sending out BTC manually. You won't get a confirmation email, but if you're able to use the browser, then you're in our system and you will get your BTC sooner or later.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:00:52
Sorry about that, we had some massive load. It looks like everything is back to working order. Please try again!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:34:26
Terribly sorry about that, I will make sure that the uninstaller not only gets added to the Start Menu, but that Cycle also appears in the Control Panel &gt; Programs screen.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:09:28
We'll be honoring all sign ups before 6:00PM PST (6 minutes ago). We're just too backed up! Everyone who signs up between 6:00PM and 8:00PM PST will be entered to win a larger chunk of BTC than we've been giving out (depending on how much we have left!)
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:02:36
Sorry about that, we had some massive load. It looks like everything is back to working order. You are registered, we just hit some limits with our emailing. We'll send out the BTC to the email addresses we get, so hopefully it isn't fake :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:38:06
Sorry about that, we started having signup issues at the time, and we were getting REALLY backed up too. Like was said previously, we're going to keep going through the list, sending out BTC. We're not even 1/3 of the way through the list! If you haven't received your BTC by tomorrow night, ping us at contact and we'll make sure you didn't fall through the cracks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:39:24
No worries, you don't have to do anything more than sign up. We always appreciate feedback though!
Here's some more data regarding the security and privacy of Cycle (from other comments):
We're built on Chromium, so your data is as safe as in Chrome. Right now, we don't even save form data and passwords because I wanted to make sure that our process for saving your personal data is even more secure than Chrome's.

@_date: 2013-11-22 00:02:49
It is! Just hang tight, we're working through the list, but it keeps growing rather than shrinking ;)
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:15:31
Tabs get automatically categorized underneath a parent "app", so that's the first attempt to categorize. If you have a large amount of apps, then yes, it could get quite messy. We're working on ways to accommodate large amounts of apps.
We have an import feature from other browsers planned, but yes, it's still a bit early. Hang tight, and we'll get it done!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:34:16
Yes, we'll be improving the indications over the next few releases. For now, the titlebar's refresh button rotates while the page is initially loading, and your mouse SHOULD show the system's default "busy" cursor. If it doesn't, I'll get that fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:52:27
Thanks for trying it out!
We're built on top of Chromium, so it's Blink (aka Webkit) and V8 underneath.
I'm always keeping my eye on other rendering engines. We certainly don't have any loyalties to Chromium, should another rendering engine (I'm looking at you, Servo) prove to be faster, more stable, and more secure.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:30:49
Sorry about that! We're working on providing visual feedback in that first-run gap.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:12:40
We're MASSIVELY backed up sending out BTC manually. You guys certainly surprised us! We'll probably going to be STILL be giving out the BTC from today on Saturday!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:20:48
Sorry about that, our confirmation system went down due to the traffic, so we can't send you a confirmation email at this time. Rest assured, you're in our system, and you will get your BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:21:15
Sorry about that, we're not even 1/3 of the way through the list! If you haven't received your BTC by tomorrow night, ping us at contact and we'll make sure you didn't fall through the cracks!

Hi, CTO here. I understand your frustration! Our built-in password manager is planned, and we'll reach out to LastPass about possibly having them integrated (I'm a LastPass user myself, but I also remember all my passwords, just in case).
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:33:14
Interesting. I have an idea of what it could be. Email us at contact and we'll follow up and send you some bitcoin because you were definitely within the promotional period. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:28:47
Our confirmation emailing system is actually what broke down. If you're able to use Cycle, you're registered, and we'll get to you. Hope your email address is valid, because that's the one we'll be sending BTC to!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:35:27
Your trepidation is understandable :). We're currently built on node-webkit, which uses Chromium as a base, so we have all the same security features. Your cookies and passwords are as safe as they are in Chrome.
We auto-categorize tabs according to the apps that they belong to, assuming you have the apps installed. You can go to our market and add Gmail and Coinbase as apps, and then the tabs will be separated from then on.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:22:24
Yes, we're sending out BTC manually, so it might take a while, but you'll get it, rest assured!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:40:39
Hi, CTO here. Mavericks is untested for us, and people using the same framework as us have occasionally reported issues with Mavericks. The icon bouncing for more than a few seconds usually means that your version is old enough that it has to download an update before it launches, but since you just downloaded it, that shouldn't happen.
Do you have a few moments to help me debug what might be going wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:45:47
And I'm the CTO. Here's my website with links to all my social media: 
We are delivering BTC via Coinbase to the email address you use to sign up with.
The homepage is still being worked on (several pages such as contact/about and FAQ still aren't up yet). It's my fault that the site wasn't more complete before this post.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:39
I'm sorry to hear that you think it sucks and is worthless. We do provide uninstallers:
Windows: We provide an "Uninstall Cycle" program for Windows in your Start Menu. We haven't yet put an entry in the system "Programs" where typical administration is, and I apologize for that. That will be remedied in a future release.
Ubuntu: apt-get remove cycle-browser
Fedora: yum erase cycle-browser
Mac OSX: Drag the icon to the Trash
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:58:56
Our email confirmation system is down, so you won't get a confirmation email. And we're sending out the BTC manually, so it could take a while!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:25:53
Ah, that's pretty simple to fix. The installer is supposed to create that symlink, but it looks like a newline got shoved in there somehow. Try the following command:
libudev1=`locate libudev.so.1 | grep -m1 'libudev.so.1$' `;
if [[ -n "$libudev1" ]]; then
  libdir=`dirname $libudev1`
  if test -L "$libdir/libudev.so.0"; then
    touch "$libdir/libudev.so.0"
  else
    sudo ln -s "$libudev1" "$libdir/libudev.so.0"
  fi
EDIT: Great! Yeah, the postinst script should've done that automatically.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:05:43
Hi, I'm the CTO. Thanks for trying to install, let's see if we can get that figured out. What version of Ubuntu are you using? I've tested with Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, and Linux Mint 13, 14, and 15.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:46:55
Hi there! Version 5 is being worked on, we're upgrading our platform so it will be much more stable and responsive. I'm glad that you like the idea, because otherwise the upgrades wouldn't be worth it. We'll keep everyone informed on the progress!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:28:47
Sorry, we're REALLY behind on the signups (~800 at this point). You guys overwhelmed us! We'll get to you, we promise!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:06:31
Thanks for the feedback! I'll be sure to take care of that.

Hi, I'm the CTO. Do you have a few minutes to help me debug the problem?
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:17:15
Hi, please see  for additional questions regarding Coinbase. You may have to transfer your bitcoin to different wallet (or wallet service) before moving money in and out if you don't have a VISA or US bank account.

No, the application is running on your computer, but it logs in and stores its session in the cloud. Doesn't affect the speed

Hi, I'm looking into it now.
Edit: Sorry about that, found the error, I'll push the fix shortly. You should be able to log in fine though.
Edit 2: Also, if you don't get your BTC soon, please let us know (contact The error occurred right before our BTC-giving portion.

We are! Sorry, it's a bit backed up. And our email system is down for the rest of the day at a minimum. We're sending them out manually, just sit tight!

Thanks for the compliment on the design! Sorry to hear that it's a little sluggish for you. The experience at the moment varies widely across different hardware and OSes. We'll be upgrading the rendering engine to fully utilize Chromium's multi-process architecture soon. That, combined with additional tweaks to our interface should remove the sluggishness from all but the lowest-end hardware.
Be sure to check it out in a few weeks, it'll auto-update to the latest version!

Hi, CTO here. Have you not been able to install the .deb, or not been able to open?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:36:26
Yes, we're currently built on node-webkit, which uses Chromium as its rendering Engine.

Sorry about the delay, we're seeing 5 times the amount of signups/minute that we got during our last promotion. Manually sending them isn't scaling very well. We'll get it to you as soon as we can, even if it takes us all weekend! :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:00:12
Ah, yes, that is a planned feature! We'll try to get it included as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:04:26
Thanks a lot! We hope Cycle and the BTC continues to serve you well :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:24:08
I'm sorry about that! Somebody earlier hit the same error, so I have the fix ready to go, but we're hitting some heavy load. I'm scaling up our infrastructure now to handle the load while I push the fix.

Sorry about that, our email system hit capacity, so our password reset is also not working at the moment. Send us an email at contact and I'll try to get you sorted out. Thanks!

There's still BTC, it's just taking a while to send out manually! Glad that you like it, we release updates about once per week, and it'll automatically download them so it only gets better.

Ah, good. It'll probably work on another machine. My next guess is that you don't have "xcopy.exe" in your path. If you type in the command prompt:
where xcopy.exe
It should print out:
If it doesn't, then that's the problem. Either way, it's a bad assumption on my part that xcopy would always be in the path, so the next release will fix that.

They are. Current Chromium versions use Blink and V8 for rendering and javascript, respectively. Node-webkit was named before the change and they currently have no plans to change the name, but they (and we) are using Blink as well. You can read more about node-webkit at
