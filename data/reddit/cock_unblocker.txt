73 days later...also if they don't learn they would just get fired because they would suck. Point still stands you can't be risk adverse

No MtGox?

This wasn't an "earnest payment", I believe you are misusing this term. If you read the entire post, you'll see they make muiltple months payments and acknowledge the contract which they are abiding by. Now even If by some magical way they weren't the company that actually signed the contract, they could be liable to fulfill the terms because they implied ownership, made payments, made no effort to correct the issue until they realized it wasn't profitable, and assumed liability. A court would most likely find them in a legal contract

Lol fuck off 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:31:03
I apologize for that, you seem to have this mentality that everybody is using it to do what you're doing. But the fact is a lot of people in this sub are losing money and they're losing money because they're listening to people like you instead of people like me telling them 24% loss in a single day is just fine  
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:20:11
How is that nice? He has a loss of 24% value in a single day.....    
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:38:30
What the fuck is wrong with all you people, there are so many funds designed for college education for young kids. Use those 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:23:27
LMAO, I work at a bank. $10,000 isn't even a blip on the radar 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:06:10
What about it?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:33:55
What bounce? It's been a bear trend for over a year. You don't seem to understand that phrase 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:51:56
Why? Where is the demand coming from?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:10:54
It is Now you're at a loss of $7,795. Get out now don't be stupid 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:51:58
I understand what you mean but since products priced in Bitcoin are pegged to the USD conversion rate your strategy doesn't make sense. Sorry 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:42:31
85% in a little over a year isn't fast for you? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:17:51
Don't go into why demand is falling thought, that's out of circle jerk territory  
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:38:16
Market orders sell at market price butthead. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:07:13
Uses day trading techniques to find a purchase point. Uses long term investor sentiment that has been baked into the price over and over again to rationalize  that purchase point. Recipe for total disaster. GL   
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:41:30
Yeah but it's so much easier to give a kid a lottery ticket then to research a proper investment strategy. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:56:17
Source: your ass. Most people who buy coins are actually traders. Those are speculators. Also holding coins just to sell for a higher rate are speculators no matter how long you hold it 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:14:12
Hmmm I guess you're right. Even if it goes down to such a small price which would indicate there is a huge issue with Bitcoin and something catastrophic has happened, there would STILL be delusional folks like you to buy it up.  10cents means a drop of 99.999% from its high. That means something broke, badly. But hey! You don't even know what it is and YOURE already in line to buy it up on blind faith alone. That's your position here. Idiotic.   
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:41:11
What? It's common knowledge that most coins trade between exchanges. I forgot the metric but it shows the time a coin sits in a certain wallet, most of the volume was created by exchanges under a day. What do stocks have to do with anything. My point is no one is spending these things they are just trading them, hence the price drop from plus $1,000 to $185ish. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:53:46
No, as of right now that BTC buys 24% less than yesterday. This pseudo investment logic circle jerk is what keeps you people in the dark. An unrealized loss of 24% in 24 hours is an awful thing no matter how you slice it 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:54:35
$0.00 is possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:37:23
You got the percentages backward. 99% of the people here are speculators. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:07:45
I didn't mean literally zero people. If that was true it would instantly be $0.00. How is there "good" support if the price is falling? It means people are leaving the market 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:08:59
What? Because there has been demand for the coin in a speculative manner. Which means people were buying it hoping to make more than they paid. Without them what do you think it's worth?
Edit: I do believe there are people who buy BTC and don't speculate and actually use it to buy shit. But at most 5% of actually owners 
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:14:33
Boy this sub sure has turned to shit if this is the 3rd post on the front page. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:35:20
Actually USD is worth the same overthere. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:53:51
I know fuck me right? This asshole doesn't realize his entire investment could be ruined if some asshat accidentally knocks over a shelf. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:25:37
Even if it was friendly, it currently offers no incentive for going through all the hassle. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:24:02
Look at his post history. This guy is so fucked in the head. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:04:47
Lmao, anything with the ability to be exchanged in the future or a greater price then it was purchased for can be in investment
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:55:30
Dont be fucking stupid please. Even if you believe Bitcoin is the way of the future you should never tie 100% of your income to something so risky 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:20:47
No one is buying, hence the price drop 
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:49:52
I swear all you folk are from the middle of the boonies with the way you don't understand basic economics.
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:01:08
The last one is the best part of it all.
They say its not their contract yet pay the monthly fee of $10,000 every month............
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:25:16
Because you're the idiot arguing that 24% price drop in a day isn't a big deal! Even to do what you just did you need a stable market! 
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:53:11
I think from his user name he is 14 years old...
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:39:52
But the risk appetite for life savings should never be this much. This was an awful idea. The risk is way to high. OP take your money out please  
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:59:30
I know. I didn't lose 10BTC with this one trick. Scammers HATE me 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:32:32
It's easy to buy or post your own fake positive reviews. You can only take negative reviews for any value. This is what I found when I added "review" to your search 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:33:39
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:29:08
Or maybe he will do a tiny bit of research before transfering $3,000 somewhere? Isn't the entire point of Bitcoin to take banking into you're own hands? Personal responsibility?
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:11:36
It's called demand 
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:12:15
Isn't that normal in Bitcoin terms ?
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:36:43
Cocaine blocks the receptors for remorse when you lose and turns on the receptors of joy when you win. The opposite of how normal person views risk. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:50:32
This is good for traders 
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:58:25
What am I looking at here?
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:24:11
Wait the guy in the email was a real DEA agent? And he was undercover? But his LinkedIn says DEA agent on it!
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:15:39
Ahh shit I just lost my money 
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:41:24
And stolen 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:26:41
Wouldn't say that too loud around here. People talk like Bitcoin cured their kids cancer or something. Never seen a group of people get so excited over payments before.....
