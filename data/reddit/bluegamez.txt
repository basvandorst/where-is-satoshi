I tried to buy an iPhone from there. I wanted merely 5% discount. But, for 3 straight week, there was no response. I had to cancel it ultimately.

Really? Block generation involves hash function, which involves prime numbers.

Good to see redesigned bitcoin.org. We're working on coinlearn.org to have an umbrella FAQ for cryptocurrencies in general.

There'll most likely be a crash @ $10k, which may bring down the price as low as $1k. Dont lose that opportunity, as bull run will begin after that, backed by Lightning Network, Sidechain, Rootstock, Schnorr, Tumblebit and many more, which will turn bitcoin into a fast, secure, uncensored, decentralized network, where smart contract will work on Layer 2.

My experience with Purse.io is not so good so far. I am from India and hence have to use amazon.in. I ordered an iPhone on Feb 10, asking for 20% discount. It was unsold. On Feb 16, I changed the discount to 15%. It is still unsold till date. It seems like, I have to cancel the order, sell BTC directly and buy it with cash.

Now-a-days, u can not trust any electronic device not to remember your activity. Hence, my paper wallets are hand written.

Which one of these [VPS plans]( should be considered viable to host a Bitcoin full node?

Postponing a verdict is now **Breaking News**? How low can this click-baiting go?

Not really. BTCPay claims to be a alternative of BitPay. The real function of BitPay is allowing merchants to serve Bitcoiners, while dealing with FIAT at their end. Its a bridge between Bitcoin &amp; FIAT. As of yet, BTCPay does NOT do that. What BTCPay really does so far, is comparable to Bitcoin transaction API providers like BlockCypher. Hence I asked **How is BTCPay better than BlockCypher?**

While running  for over one and a half year, the main difficulty I have faced is the increased use of ad blocker among users. This chokes the earning from various ad networks.
