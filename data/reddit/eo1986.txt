should I expect to make 1.44 btc a day, and so like 43.2 a month?

Thank you, how did you get 3,413,842.72GH/s as 1%?
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:29:37

if bitcoin manages to penetrate 1% of the world population, the it is a massive success! so do the calculations yourself.
I personally think bitcoin becomes something nice and reaches a 0.1% penetration...

is there any way around this? If we give them proof of identity etc?

maybe the government will tax us in bitcoins too, of course that would be slightly problematic for tax returns due to volatility

I was actually thinking the same thing, but it should definitely be a weighted average, weighted by the volume of liquidity.
Otherwise we could have a tiny exchange with little volume affecting the price too much.

Would be incredible, but probably not this year

I have friends who didn't own any at 100 and been waiting for a correction to 60!

you can try day trading it, but it is really difficult and don't cry well you sell low and buy high
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:57:06
but we were at 200 a month ago?
it just doesn't make sense to expect something to go up in a straight line fashion

nice timing
but I hope you regret this decision in the long term :)
