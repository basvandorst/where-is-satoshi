Looks like you are paid to not be aware of the problem. Gavin saw this coming years ago, and you are still not aware of it? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 11:47:53
You did not answer my question, and my personal investments have nothing to do with it. If you believe investors have little or no influence on companies, you should state so.
@_date: 2016-11-23 10:14:55
Then you agree that AXA owns parts of Blockstream. Do you think owners are without influence on their companies?
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:25:35
So you disagree with the ecosystem and the miners. Maybe start your own coin? A spin-off perhaps with new POW algo? You could call it BRG Coin! 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:26:05
It's not about 2MB anymore. Now, the miners are interested in a solution that lets the market decide what the maximum size of a block should be. If you want to be updated about the trends among miners, you should go to a place where people can write what they want.

Plenty of time for core devs to plan their retirement. Or is it?
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:43:01
Hand over from who? Core? Blockstream? Axa?
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:42:17


Yes, it's 1000 times more. But it's not that much really. We all download movies. Some of us even download 3D HD movies. And the "block propagation time" issue was solved by Bitcoin Unlimited developer Peter Tchipper with Xthin. That was the last argument Core had for choking bitcoin at 3 transactions per second. Then, they made their own version of it, compact blocks without giving Peter cred.
Bitcoin Unlimited have a lot more up our sleeves. If you believe bitcoin can scale on chain, you are also able to make the solutions. Core doesn't, therefore they can't.
As in a lot of CS, it's a matter of tweeking and engineering. Not being extreme.
I am not against off chain solutions, and I think it was sad to see ChangeTip go. Someone else will take this market in the future. Maybe one of the experimental Lightning versions out there. I doubt Blockstream will pull that one off due to poor organization and leadership.
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:08:22
Let me get this straight: You admit that investors have influence on companies? Seems like you try to avoid this simple question. Maybe you don't like the truth.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:50:56
No, I don't want you to be scared. But I think you are. Change is comming, regardless of your or my feelings :)
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:26:53
How rude!
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:22:53
It takes 1 gig blocks to reach 3000 trx/s on the current system. That is 50% more than the average for VISA.
(Source: 
One gig every 10 minutes is 1,6 MB every second. Not that much, really. And we should not expect VISA levels until a few years into the future. At that point in time, you will still be able to run a full node on your iPhone.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:31:20
You might be surprised to see the egg kicking the chicken's ass ;)
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:53:36
You only need to upload transactions to 2 nodes to get an exponential distribution in a p2p network. 50 is better, 10.000.000 even better. But 2 is enough to get the sweet effect of exponential distribution.
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:30:37
So who is the ecosystem? You change definitions all the time...
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:55:04
"should" is wishful thinking. The way bitcoin is set up today, nodes will have to follow miners when they go for BU (if they want to stay relevant as bitcoin nodes).
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:36:20
Sooo... we are talking about non-mining AND mining nodes handing the power of deciding the max block size to the mining nodes...
Then I have to say I disagree. If the mining nodes can take the power, they allready have it.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:10:55


I guess the market.


What a weired question.


If you want to understand what's going on right now, you should read forums where people can write what they want.
@_date: 2016-11-22 04:08:34
So everybody is the enemy now? Even the bitcoin businesses? Because they didn't expect bitcoin to be choked at 3tps?
You might be on your way to losing when everybody around you are enemies. Old devs, new devs, early adopters, businesses, miners, pools, forum participants etc etc etc.
When Bitcoin Unlimited becomes the standard for miners and bitcoin goes to the moon both in usage and value, you might change your mind ;)
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:41:43
A lot of people are working together to scale bitcoin on chain. To make it a better and more useful currency to more people.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:19:15
Isn't China bigger than Europe (Area, people, economy)?
@_date: 2016-11-23 09:34:50
AXA's investments in Blockstream are real. Or do you deny that?
@_date: 2016-11-23 10:01:49
Claims that transactions with fees are spam looks highly suspect.
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:29:07
So now it's the "ecosystem" handing over power. I spent so much time getting you to say that the non-mining and mining nodes were the ones handing power to the mining nodes. And then you change your mind? It's hard to take you seriously when you shift all the time.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:39:16
I think the biggest miners and pools are making up their minds about what software they want to run and how to prevent orphans when they switch right now ;)
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:13:28
So no one have the control over the max block size now? Not even Core?
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:45:59
Certainly, I totally agree. I just used it as a measure stick. I am sure we can scale a lot more than that on chain in the future. And I'm not against off chain solutions.
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:08:36
IDK. I think it's just Core/Blockstream that lose power when the miners upgrade to BU. The end users will stop having transactions stuck in mempool like they have today. The fees will be predictable. More people will join the ecosystem. Bitcoin will go to the moon. ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:20:00
So you mean to hand the power over max block size from Core, right? Must be Core handing over the power over max block size to the miners if they start to mine BU then. If it's not Core that does this, they don't control the power over max block size.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:02:03
Sounds like you don't understand what bitcoin is, but you are scared about the winds of change that is coming from China. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:33:06
Yeah, concern troll FUDing about the upcomming full blocks for years. And now they are here (for 6 months). Denial much?
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:05:58
Do you mean non-mining nodes?
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:57:11
Ask Peter Todd, he can give you some RBF if you need it. Then you can just bid against yourself and make more seats on the same bus.
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:49:00
Do you mean Core? It's a simple question.
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:01:07
Do you think miners and pools need to be altruistic for bitcoin to work? That miners should not try to maximize profit?
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:20:32
Not true. I was there when they first met.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:48:19
Are you serious?
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:13:35
Yet, a lot of people will get into bitcoin through Coinbase, using bank accounts. That's how I buy my coins. Not on the street with localbitcoins, cash &amp; pepper spray in my pocket.
@_date: 2016-11-21 22:58:47
We're talking about the control over the max blocksize, right? Not the control over transaction verification?
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:33:58
Good to hear that you are prepared. BU doesn't really need to be "activated", but you probably know that. Thanks for your response :)
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:27:22
Why do you think miners and pools make more profit by blocking segwit?
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:20:38
Slightly off topic, but I'm curious: Are you running real BU on a mining node now, or are you just signaling BU support for those who votes that?
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:31:14
Why do you think that? There is so much going on now outside of Core. The changes will be visible soon.
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:42:02
And what is my batshit crazy conspiracy theory?
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:40:12


Great quote!
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:33:21
So... miners are a central "top down" entity? The single point of failiure? If you believe that, why are you in bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:30:18
Yes, the election is over. Why don't we all just go home? ;)
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:48:44
VISA is on top already! There are many VISA cards you can top up with bitcoin. A guy (don't remember his nick) wrote about it a few days ago and made the brilliant conclusion: It's fiat backed by bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:33:40
If you want to be enlightened, you shoud go to a forum without strong censorship.
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:49:41
So the pools and miners will support it and it will trigger at the 95% threshold. Mission complete?
EDIT: No elephant in the chat room, right?
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:55:53
I'm refering to the future. Time will show.
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:50:55
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:14:54
China had already did it more than 1000 years earlier, that's why they were biggest? And you are not talking about Alex the great or the Roman empire. You are talking about Europe 1870-1915?
EDIT: Hell, I forgot the vikings trade expantion from the middle east to discovering America, (Not very Platon inspired, lol!)
