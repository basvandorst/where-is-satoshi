The idea that the only incentive for transaction processors to validate transactions is to be granted some underlying tokens is a fallacy and shows an incredible lack of understanding of incentives and how they work.

Tim is entirely correct.  It's a great deck.  I'd like to have seen the full presentation.

The game is on between permissionless and permissioned ledgers.  Coin or no coin?  For many of the banks' use cases, coinless permissioned systems will work just fine.

Gold is the 'unimpeachable store of value'.  Try use you bitcoin when you have no electricity.

It seems the Fed is seriously considering rebuilding the payments system from the ground up.  In the past they would have focused entirely on interbank payments.  Now the mandate is end-to-end.  Obviously a huge opportunity for cryptocurrencies to get engaged.

Great tune.

Once you get used to Ripple's 5 second transaction time, it's hard to to go backward.  And, there is already a ton of multicurrency liquidity on the network with endpoints in many different countries.  It's a no-brainer really.

And capital rotates out of BTC into ETH.

The bickering is hurting but the stagnant blocksize improvement is killing BTC.  Pull your thumbs out devs.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:08:48
You are completely right.  Bitcoin is stuck technically and politically.  Meanwhile the world moves on and gets interested in other blockchains.  It only takes a quick glance at Coinmarketcap.com to see what has been happening these past weeks.  The devs need to get their heads out of their asses.

And the community is now held hostage to a bunch of Chinese miners behind the great firewall.  The world is moving on....

A buying opportunity?

Good analysis here.

Are you referring to the fork or to Bitcoin in general?

Different issuers of fiat have different counterparty risks.  That's why USD.snapswap may not trade at parity with USD.bitstamp (although in practice, they are very close to 1:1).  In fact, it's a lot like how the banking system used to be before central banking appeared (here's a good link to learn more about that:   But liquid issuers such as USD.chase and USD.bankofamerica would be expected to trade at par.

What meta protocol was used to issue the 'smart securities' onto the Bitcon blockchain?  Was it an existing one (Counterparty, Omni, Colored Coins, etc.) or was it a purpose-built meta protocol developed by Symbiont?

What he described is just one small (but very important) part of the Ripple protocol - the distributed exchange.  In Ripple pathfinding through different order books is built into the protocol itself and is extremely efficient.

It's definitely a bubble in stupidity.  That is completely clear.

Fractional reserve started with the rehypothication of anther immutable asset - gold.  You have no idea what you are talking about....

I wonder if Coinbase has polled their users on the right approach?
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:32:47
What makes "blockchain technology" appealing to banks is the prospect of being able to participate on a cryptographically secure database that is distributed among them all but that none of them individually control.  It could provide them a way of instantly clearing and settling transactions across a range of asset classes and perhaps remove billion$ in legacy backend costs.  It may well be that blockchain technology is not the answer for their needs but it is the spark that has started the conversation.  And that is a good thing.

Two questions:
1) How is leg risk eliminated?
2) What happens if the payment is sent to the wrong address?
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:36:53
100% correct.  It'd be funny if it wasn't such a big problem.
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:29:17
There's probably not much left.

I like Coinbase but there are no new ideas in that blog post.
