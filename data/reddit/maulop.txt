lol, we're about to end january and it's already the year of alternate coins?
Bitcoin is still in diapers, but it has proven to be stronger and more stable and secure to attacks than other coins. The problem with altcoins is that they don't have near the amount of users than bitcoin has, so they haven't experienced the problems of bitcoin. Other promising coins are still in beta or in closed development. Also not many altcoins have been used to purchase stuff, so they haven't been put to the test properly.
The LN and other developments to come will only strengthen the position of bitcoin as a currency, and the fact of btc being decentralized will play an interesting role in the world economy, now that other countries have more motives to stop using the dollar away as the de-facto currency for international trade. If they succeed, everyone will be in for a surprise if the dollar price falls. (and a war along with it, maybe).
What I expect for this year is that people starts accepting Bitcoin as a currency to do business, and keep it circulating in the network instead of trading it for fiat. That will drive the price up like crazy.

I think apps that help and enable merchants to implement easily Bitcoin payments and LN as a turnkey solution will speed up adoption. I'm a designer and looking for tools like that. Not many are accepting BTC or other coin payments because of the fees and the obscurity around the implementation.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:24:00
That's an easy to use implementation. The user should be able to discriminate between currencies when paying. But it's only in USA. Most countries can't use it, probably because local regulations or bank interference, and it still doesn't eliminate the fact that is another intermediary in the chain of payments. I think the future is smart contracts, at least for services; but as I said: there are no tools available. Even for a smart contract you need to know how to program one, and it still is too obscure for someone who doesn't have a background or interest on computer science, or programming.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:00:38

@_date: 2017-12-05 04:12:02
At this moment, even if bitcoin has a high appreciation against other currencies, and it has a number of features that makes it trustworthy, it still feels like playing monopoly alone.
Bitcoin isn't "being your own bank", it's more like having a piggy bank. Someone steals your private key (breaks the pig), and your money is gone. At least with banks you have insurance for your money if there's some form of fraud or theft.
You have to think mainstream. No one is going to adopt a new technology if it isn't easy to use, useful or related to something you know. (I accept bitcoin and other cryptos as payment for my design services, but no one that hired me uses those currencies).
Big retail companies won't adopt bitcoin, if they're selling more than a million a day, if the cryptocurrency system can't handle the transactions and also give trust to the seller. That's why electronic payment systems have contracts that cover cases of fraud, and they can handle returns and issue credit notes within the system easily.
The food service industry also won't adopt it if they don't have any tools to handle the payments and controlling the staff. Imagine the waiter issues the customer a QR from his phone to his own wallet instead of the address from the restaurant to pay. The places you mention don't sell items in bitcoin at the same rate as fiat money (for obvious reasons), so they can still handle it as losses if the transactions stays unconfirmed. And not every store accepts bitcoin, only some of them.
Also the volatility of the price is so high, that you won't know how to handle the losses if the price drops too much on a pay day.
And finally, if the BTC price wasn't compared to another currency, how you determine the real value? Consider that not many are using it for regular business trade, and it doesn't have any other uses aside doing transactions. At least gold is used in a lot of other industries to manufacture tangible products. With that you understand that it has some value.

BTC was made to solve some problems that you can find in fiat money. (Double spending, Inflation, and security) However it works like a digital piggy bank (a wallet). Where you have a "key" (public key) for the coin slot, and another key (private key) that allows you send the coins to another wallet.
So you own your money and have to be responsible with its storage. You can have as many wallets as you want, and several public keys tied to the same wallet. You lose the private key and you lose your money, so learning about it's safety is a must.
The interesting part, is that BTC is deflationary, so every time your money has more value. (you can purchase more things with less money). When I bought bitcoin (two months ago), the value was $5000 per 1 BTC, and now it's almost $20000 for 1 BTC. You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can buy a fraction on an exchange.
And the uses on day to day basis are possible. Not in btc, but in btc to dollars, euros or pounds, through exchanges and debit cards issued by some exchanges or operators.
Example: If you are in USA, you can have an account on coinbase, which is an exchange that allows you to store your BTC and trade it for other digital coins or dollars, euros, etc. Then there's Shift, who issues VISA debit cards that work with coinbase allowing you spend your BTC in regular stores without fees as long you do it inside the country, and charges fees internationally. Other operators like Bitpay or Xapo offer similar cards, but with different conditions. The only problem with this method is that you are not in control of your btc, the exchange is, and operates like a bank.
I don't know if you should invest in BTC, but as far as I know, the last bitcoin will be mined by the year 2130, so there's a lot of room for its value to grow. The more people buys bitcoin, the more value it will have, since it's scarce and limited. Also right now is really slow and expensive to do transactions on the bitcoin network, but there are technologies being designed to overcome this obstacles, allowing btc to operate like any normal currency, or even faster.
And if you just want to use it to store btc and then do withdrawals when the price goes up, it also can work like that.

The problem isn't bitcoin, it's the users who are not using BTC as a currency. They're just holding in hope to cash out someday. (that's why it looks like a bubble about to burst).
If you're looking at BTC from a developed country, it isn't that interesting or useful, since many have their economic needs solved and have a lot of available tools to conduct trade and business, and the fiat currency is strong enough to do anything; but bitcoin seems great to grow your money as it appreciates by speculation.
But if you're in an underdeveloped or emerging country, where many people cannot afford banking services; this system is amazing, and has a lot of potential for business and trade. And that's about 3 billion people that could be benefited from it. The real value of BTC comes from using it.

What are your concerns about that? Unless there's a legitimate reason and a legal action for a government to trace back and go after your funds, you have nothing to worry about. No one is interested in how you spend your money, unless it raises an alarm. ( Like buying weapons, gunpowder or materials to build a bomb). The rest of the "evil government" thing is mostly paranoia.
Even in my country, the government and the police can track you easily if they want, but still they need a real reason, and processing times are slow enough to put obstacles. Also marketers can access your credit score and some of them your purchasing history, but there's not much that they can do with that information, otherwise they'll be questioned or sued.

For some things, public knowledge of the owner of an account is important. Like knowing that you're sending money to a store when you're paying at the cashier, instead of sending money directly to the cashier's personal account. I think something like registered vanity addresses will be necessary for businesses.
Also for things like engaging in a joint venture, knowing that your associates are solvent and not showing you or using somebody else's wallet is very important.
I've discussed this several times, but anonimity is different from privacy, and bitcoin is private enough to allow transactions and allowing people being accountable for their doings by tracing the accounts. Many addresses the issue of wanting being anonymous for the sake of feeling comfortable with knowing that no one can peek at their account and realise the amount or lack of money in the wallet. But we also have to look at it differently, like the priorities of purchasing goods with bitcoin will change a lot, since there's no credit system and no payments in installments. You will have to value more your money and what's necessary for you, and you will also need to save money instead of asking for a loan before buying a house or a car.
Also second layer services should help to protect the identity of the people when they're buying everyday things, but we're still in bitcoin's infancy.

Actually it could be beneficial to have traceability and accountability in politics. You'll know where is all the government spending going and its justification. Probably in an integrated system, the IRS will know your purchasing history, but not your neighbours or friends.

The most important value it has is that is secure in terms of transactions (too hard to create counterfeits). And the design of the transaction method implies that the more people uses it, and the more nodes and miners are backing up the system, the more it appreciates. So in the end, more security = more users (nodes, miners, end users) = bigger system = more value = more trust. And also some side effects for commerce, like the fact that you cannot buy with credit or do business without actually having the money (and you can check that the person is solvent), then you can really focus on the business instead of paying 3rd parties to handle your money, and the accounting speeds up.
I think we're still a bit far from getting all the benefits of Bitcoin. We still need smart contracts, other apps built on top of it, easier methods of using it (better wallets and payment processors), and the mass adoption.

It could be convenient for governments to detach themselves from the production and control of money. Most of the times they're engaging in massive loans, economic adjustments, and always are at loss and at mercy of bank and industrial lobbying. Also they're competing against other currencies, which leaves them vulnerable to crisis if people start moving money away from the country.
Banks will also lose part of their power because there will be no need for most individuals to use bank services. (they will have to go back to the business of lending money or protecting assets for big companies or wealthy people).
Look at the world debt clocks ( and notice that most countries have the capacity to repay their debt, except for USA, Japan, Greece, Belgium, Portugal and Spain, but Japan is embracing cryptocurrencies (that could mean that they already want to detach from the regulation of the economy).
The problem is that embracing crypto completely, is that implies a huge shift in the way we use money and produce stuff. And that means that the choices of what you're buying should be more conscious and oriented to preserve your wealth on the long term, more than 'luxury' shopping or buying just because there's a sale, since you can't buy things with credit, and poverty under bitcoin will be brutal if there aren't enough jobs or good social security programs. So: No lambos, but better and cheaper cars probably.

1.- It's value can't be manipulated by a central authority. It's detached from a controlling or issuing source like a government or a bank, but the fluctuations of its value can be influenced by the market.
2.- It works just like a digital money transfer, from one account to another and you can use it to pay for goods and services as long someone is willing to receive them as a valid currency.
3.- Since it's digital and controlled by multiple nodes that verifies the validity of the transactions, accounting for each transaction is easier to track an audit than banknotes. Also other features like security, multisignature accounts and smart contracts gives it an advantage over paper money.
4.- As a store of value, that works while the market is willing to use it, and since it's scarce and finite; the more the market uses the currency, the higher its value.

Consider that in the future, the technology will make mining faster and more energy efficient.

There's still a lot of things missing before that happens:
* Key in hand nodes and software for commerce. (point of sale, accounting)
* Better safety and easy usage of wallets.
* Smart Contracts in bitcoin. (for business, judicial sentences, payroll, insurance, healthcare, etc.)
* More smart services layered on top of the bitcoin mainnet (payments like lightning network, taxes, insurance, registration of a business attached to wallets and vanity addresses for them, banking, family oriented wallets).
When a society notices that bitcoin has so many features that makes your economic life easier and safer than using banking or fiat, they will switch in a blink. Otherwise it will still be perceived as terrorist money or a pyramid scheme by the majority.

If something can scale greatly, like a million transactions per nanosecond without control (extreme example), it presents a problem when you don't have traceability. Fraud can happen too quickly and without a way to audit it. Then, the problem won't be drug dealers or criminals, it would be rich people and corporations trying to avoid taxes or mask their earnings. That's why you need a set of rules. If you're in charge of running the country and you're out of funds, how are you going to sustain it when no one will voluntarily pay taxes or reveal their income.
I think Bitcoin is now interesting for governments because it could separate the ties with private actors that can control the economy, and provides them a better way to trace the expenditure of funds. But they need a way to regulate it so it can be safe for the public and the government.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:47:32
Think about technology evolving. If bitcoin keeps on developing, we'll get better safety measures to avoid losing coins while respecting valid transactions and making fraud very hard, and making the user experience easier for users and merchants.

Adoption will come with ease of use. 
* Selling ready-to-run bitcoin and lightning nodes for merchants, and Point of Sale systems so they can integrate them into their current payment options. (provide security for them and strenghten the network)
* Wallets that are secure and easier to use that provides the same or more services than a bank without paying more (multi sig wallets, smart contracts, anti-fraud mechanisms).
* Exchanges and ATMs that provide easier access to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
* Laws that provide a secure environment for the use of cryptocurrencies.
* Mechanisms that automate taxes.
* Better traceability without compromising privacy (you can catch a thief or a fraudster and get your money back)
With that in place, people will educate themselves on how to use it, since it will be a new option on the market. The same happened with smartphones vs mobile phones, the car vs the horse, flying vs taking a bus or a ship, airbnb vs hotels, uber vs taxis.
You can advertise a cryptocurrency with words like freedom or privacy, but in the end, the average user wants convenience. Privacy is a non-issue for them since the bank already has all their data and it probably shared that information to other business partners.

I think adoption for btc will start with commerce. The same happened with credit cards. Banks had to approach the commerce first to give them the tools to accept the virtual currency safely. (also they had to train people on how to use that weird copying machine and fill out the papers that had to go to the bank to reclaim their money, and a lot of mistakes were made at that time). With Bitcoin this is a hard one to tackle, but if it is convenient for commerce and people starts noticing, they will start asking about it.

Bitcoin is based on exchanging money like it is cash. That part is solved properly. Another thing is the layers built on top to solve the everyday problems of commerce, like: guarantees, refunds, inventory, balance sheets, taxes, loss of product, bad batches of products delivered, lack of funds, etc. Without smart contracts you won't want to buy with btc from any seller if they don't deliver your product or the service is bad. Or offering services when the customer is dissatisfied with the quality of it and refuses to pay (or he never intended to pay). A smart contract can save you the wasted time. Wether is centralized or not I think that's up to the users to decide on who are they going to choose to provide that middle layer.

I think people also should realize that with technological advances, the energy consumption is being lowered. A fridge today consumes at least 50% less electricity than one made in the 80's.

Also new power generators will be more efficient, and the mining machines will consume less power to do the same job.

Because you are looking at it at a personal scale. Big companies move millions of dollars on a regular basis, wether is payments to providers, or processing payments from customers (imagine administering walmart or a mining company). Using swift or escrow services to pay international providers have high fees for the transactions, and sometimes takes at least 5 days to verify and approve the international transaction. With something like ripple, every part of the transaction is traced and automated. More security and speed for the bank and it's insurance company, less waiting time for the providers, and more trust for the company paying.
So banks aren't jumping on the blockchain train because it's trending, it's because is useful for them, and they funded ripple to tailor it to their needs, which is very different from how bitcoin works.

you pay transaction fees when you buy something with a credit or debit card, you just don't notice it, because it's charged to the store owner, who pumped the price to compensate for those fees. If you pay in fiat at the same store, you are also paying the same price for the item, but the store "keeps" the transaction fee.

The problem is friction with other currencies and systems. No country will want to see their money vanish, devaluated or exchanged for cryptocurrency if there's no way to keep track and control of every citizen and business wealth with taxes.  Also banks and financial institutions are actively pushing their ecosystems, encouraging the development of apps, new ways of investment, commerce and different products suited for a broad range of audiences. Bitcoin being open source has no active actor challenging people and incentivating them with funds, prizes or sponsorships. So it's natural that the development is slow and done by a a few well informed enthusiasts.

What we need is more businesses working with BTC. That's a better way to give it true value.
Comparing the value of BTC against a dollar is a way to compare the exchange rate against a dominant currency, but not necessarily the real price of the coin. People like it because the 'hodlers' of BTC look at it as a savings account, and they're thinking in exchanging them for dollars at some point, but if the dollar collapses, 1 BTC could be valued in millions of worthless dollars; and without services and businesses working with BTC, the coin becomes useless.

When supermarkets implemented self service checkout they never incorporated a discount in favor of the buyer for doing the cashiers work. At least gas stations in my country did it, but not the supermarkets or other stores.
Without intermediaries, in bitcoin with the current transaction fees, it won't be necessarily cheaper than paying with a card. Transactions are about $0.20 for the seller, and sometimes an additional 2% or 3% for the buyer if it is an international purchase (on site), so you'll need to choose a very low transfer fee for BTC, which is about $3, and buy something over $100 to make it fair. So until the Lightning network is implemented, fees will still be high or competitive with the current ones for regular money.
Prices should lower, but not that much, and the transaction fee won't be incorporated in the price of a product, since that's up to the buyer.

even if money is deflationary, it needs to be moving to hold the value. Otherwise the price will drop, because there won't be any interest in buying (because it's impossible by all the people holding on to it), and no one is selling. So there won't be any interest in using the currency. Also, if transactions keep being expensive, people will lose interest because it is unpractical to use.

Because Mr. Nakamoto loves coffee?
The original idea was to make a secure trustless decentralized p2p currency for daily trading, and it is still possible.
The main problem is the way we change things. i.e: Marriage was for kings and wealthy people who wanted to secure their businesses or consolidate power with a legal partnership. With that you avoid wars, expand your lands and assets, and everyone is happy and safe. The common people wanted to feel like royalty, so they started emulating marriage rituals, until they became legal. Now divorces are a mess and expensive.
With banking is almost the same. Banks were designed for wealthy people who needed their assets managed and secured by a central authority with enough power to insure them against theft, and also provide them with tools to manage their money and projects. (loans, savings, etc.). The common people had to hide their money under the mattress and carry coins in a bag. The people wanted to feel like rich people by opening a bank account, and banks saw an opportunity to make more money in a massive scale, and offered them basic accounts and then they developed tools for them, like credit, savings, insurances, etc, but with high penalties if they missed payments or tried to defraud the bank.
Now we're in an economic mess and in a problem with the distribution of wealth, because the tools provided by the banks, plus the needs of the governments for development, and the lack of financial education of people, caused inflation and made almost everyone go in debt. 
With Bitcoin you give people, who cannot have access to banking, tools just as strong for safety, storage and control of their money. However the cost of it, is that you have to be highly educated in the use of e-wallets and public and private keys.

Note that bitcoin doesn't change its price. Its market value is compared to other currencies. The dollar is a very strong currency to do worldwide trade. It's the currency of choice to trade oil also. So the exchange rate of btc is dependant on the dominant currency. If your local currency is weaker than the dollar, it will cost more to buy btc or dollars, but if it's stronger, it will be cheaper. (like the euro or the pound, or the kuwaiti dinar). Hyperinflated currencies, like in Venezuela or Zimbabwe have a value closer to $0, and the availability of certain currencies (because of the exchange rate from local currency to dollar) can make the value shift up or down for an exchange.

I think you have to give it time. We are still in a very early adoption of Bitcoin. It indicates 18 million users, which is a lot, but insufficient for the global scale (imagine that amount but scattered on the planet, instead of concentrated on one city). Everyday commerce and trading requires that the people doing business remain at a close distance. 
For Bitcoin there are still missing certain services developed on top of the technology that makes its use simpler and well regulated.Newer cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems have this solved, but they have the intervention of big players on the economic market. (banks, big businesses). I guess the Lightning network is one of the solutions for the fees and payments, and Segwit is in charge of the security and trust of the transactions. Also the lack of cryptocurrency compatible hardware for stores and the low popularity of Bitcoin makes it harder to adopt and implement. So more things have to be developed around it, to make it more attractive for adoption.
The good thing is that the development teams takes the projection and growth of Bitcoin as something for the long term, so in that case, we can be sure that eventually this coin will work as a daily malleable asset.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:58:59
My guess is the way they're proposing ripple is to be competitive with an even lower fee. Also it isn't about owning your own money or being your own bank. It's about security mechanisms. Most people see banking from the personal experience (which is shitty), but for enterprise use it's very convenient if you have millions of dollars to be secured, and when others need some form of trust that they're paying or being paid from the company they're doing business with.

The benefit of bitcoin is that it separates the value of money from controlling sources like governments, banks or other actors (even cryptominers). And distributes the payment processors, allowing anyone to be part of it, so the network becomes really strong if a lot of people take part in it.
One problem it solves is trust. You can't get fake bitcoins if they pass one verification. Bitcoin is not anonymous, it's private (very different concepts). Fiat and credit cards have been cloned countless of times.
Merchants have to pay a fee for every credit or debit card transaction, but they tend to manipulate prices to compensate for fees, depending on the contract they have with the payment processor they hired. For users those transactions are instantaneous, however in the back end, they take at least a day to settle, and involve insurance and other mechanisms to compensate for fraud. And in the end is the buyer who pays for taxes (if you have VAT) and fees.
And if merchants wants to accept bitcoin or other digital coins, they have to install a node to verify their own transactions, otherwise it's going to be slow, and by adding nodes they give more power to the network and help with the congestion problem.
In a developed country is hard to use bitcoin when the economy has well established financial and economic systems (banking access, payment systems and options, credit). However in poor or developing countries it gives you a lot of practical benefits when you don't have all those options. You can store your money and know that the goverment cannot affect the value of the currency, or the bank is going to charge you a ridiculous amount of money for maintenance fees or freeze your account for "security". Also you don't have to hide it under the matress or having a money vault with thousands of banknotes with a total value of $100
A very interesting example happened in my country a couple of days ago: (and it can happen in other countries if a coordinated attack or some weird accident happens) There's one operator controlling the credit card and debit card network (a monopoly); banks also use their systems to handle ATM transactions. Their main server went offline, and the backup server didn't started, so the whole payment network was down. No one could pay for stuff or get money from ATMs. Also the same morning, the network that handles the insurance for public and private healthcare was down, and people couldn't use their insurance to pay for a doctor. Hospitals and clinics offered patients to pay in full to be attended and then they could get a refund with their insurance, but since it's expensive, some people went home and others waited until the problem got solved. With decentralized systems this scenario can't happen unless you destroy every access point to that network, or block internet access for the whole country.

To make Bitcoin successful, it can't just operate among people. Corporations and businesses will have to go on board with the virtual currency and the blockchain technology. And transactions will have to stop being anonymous in order to protect consumers, employees and businesses. (That's how you collect taxes).

That's the bitcoin; also the stability of a currency isn't on the currency itself, but in the environment it is traded. If political or social factors set in controlling the assets, could mean the success or failure of any currency (think about the one hundred trillion zimbabwe dollar). Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary, so theoretically it should increase in value over time because of scarcity, however sometimes it devaluates (dips) against other coins, like any other currency, then it gains traction again.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:15:29
No, I guess bitcoin will still exist, however countries will transform their own currency into cryptocurrency and start taxing the exchanges to have some insight over the use and destination of the money. Probably you'll have to justify the origin of your bitcoins to be able to convert it to another currency, or be taxed. Neutrality won't be affected, and the thing with China is all about control for stability. (imagine trying to keep the economical and political peace among 1.300.000.000 citizens), so western rules of net neutrality don't apply there.

That would be a huge problem. Decentralization on a business means that you no longer have control over the quality of the work happening on your organization. I see this daily whith retail: online and physical sales are handled by the company, but storage and delivery are two different companies. You buy something, and your product arrives when the storage manages to coordinate with the delivery company, so they tell you: "your product will arrive on tuesday between 8 am and 9 pm, and somebody has to be there to receive it". (the deliverers also outsource their drivers, so you don't have any guarantees over the handling of the product, since the rotation is high there's no preparation or induction of the drivers; and in they have an accident, you'll have to wait a lot longer). So decentralized money = great. Decentralized businesses = consumers gets affected with quality, but the business saves a lot of money.

If people keep comparing btc value to other currencies it's obvious that it will look bad. Like comparing USD to Kuwaiti Dinars. For now, the price of bitcoin seems to depend on what is happening with the dollar or the euro. If both currencies collapse, the price of bitcoin will skyrocket by comparison, not by real value. We're still starting with decentralized virtual currencies and if more people jumps in accepting bitcoin, the price should stabilize and the value will rise against other currencies.

In my country a bank transfer is instantaneous up to USD$10.000 within the country (amount depending on the bank and account type). But sending money to another country can be a pain. SWIFT numbers are for certain type of accounts which require you to prove the bank that you earn a lot of money.
For credit cards, the merchant chooses how he gets his funds transfered. The faster, the higher the fees; and it can vary from 2 days to 30 days. Most of them choose the latter because it's cheaper, and they sign a contract with the company who issues the POS machines, so no possibility of fraud on their part, and they're insured for credit card fraud. Although signing with them can be slow, expensive and irritating.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:37:03

Tulips are grown by bulbs that can be divided each time a new plant appears. So eventually everyone can grow a tulip without depending on a farmer. In money terms that could means devaluation by becoming something common and easy to get. (everyone has one, so there are no incentives to sell a tulip at a high price).
With bitcoins the supply is limited to 21 million, so the value will be set by the trading and holding of the coins, and the amount of miners on board with supporting the nodes and transactions. The more people trade, the value will stabilize. The longer people hold on to it, it will rise in value because it will be hard to buy from others. (this value is in comparison to other currencies). The only way that the value of the bitcoin drops, is that something so massive happens that makes having a bitcoin an inconvenience, and makes everyone want to trade their coins for other currencies. (that could be a better coin, hacking, government laws). Since in that scenario is inconvenient to have bitcoins, exchanges and traders won't buy them, making the price drop almost to $0.

There are some initiatives outside of bitcoin about social or communal lending. I think bolivian towns that do not have banking do things like that. Haven't seen it applied with bitcoins, but it's a good idea, however some protection mechanisms need to be in place, like transferring the funds with a smart contract that binds the owner of the money, the loaner and the person needing the loan. But the loaner has to figure out how to do some background credit check on the loanee first.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:05:27
This one is very long, but bear with me:
I'm not sure if Bitcoin will be successful as a "replacement" of fiat currency. One of the problems I see is, from the viewpoint of governments and tax authority, is the anonymity of the transactions. Since you can't identify a user, there's no way to tax that person or know if it is involved in illegal activities. And while many use the argument of privacy, I think they are confusing privacy with anonymity. If you live on a city, there's a lot of infrastructure that has to be maintained (roads, transportation, basic services, safety, education, healthcare, and crooked politicians.), but without the right proportion of taxes; it's impossible to keep everything running for the amount of people who lives in a city. Also, you don't want someone on the loose committing crimes or selling illegal drugs or guns in your neighborhood via untraceable transactions, because in the long term it devalues the surroundings, and the quality of life goes down.
The other part is the handling of the bitcoin. Transactions are slow and the verification process has fees, so how's that cheaper than using a bank if every transaction can be subjected to fees? I've seen the argument of 'freedom' of owning your money, which is also confused with 'liberty' (of doing whatever you want to do with your money). Even banks are insured in the case of failure, so in that scenario, so there isn't any advantage for Bitcoin against a bank if you lose all your money or it gets stolen from your account. It's complicated to understand how transactions work, how to handle public and private keys (probably many had published their private keys instead of the public ones by mistake). The numerous cases of hacking and theft of cryptos, means that the security has to be improved. Most users aren't really good with computers, and they don't know about computer security, strong passwords or what malware or a keylogger is. So it can be scary for them to switch to a cryptocurrency.
For the standpoint of businesses, it's almost the same for the government case. No traceability of the money means that there's no accountability for mistakes, and no way to make projections or improvements of products or services based on who bought what and how is been used.
The blockchain tech is amazing tho, and I guess it will be adopted in the short term by companies and governments because it has a lot of benefits for improving workflows. And my guess for cryptocurrencies, is that governments, like Russia is doing now, will transform their currency into crypto, but with a more controlled and transparent version. Probably in the future we will have blockchain id's, and everything will be associated to them. What we have to be careful with is how privacy is handled. Example: your ID is linked to your social history (criminal records, properties, marital status, age, money transactions, healthcare), but only authorized parties can have access to those records. If you go to a hospital, they can only see your health history, but the insurance company or the pharmacy cannot check any of it. The police can only see your criminal history, but not the rest of your data, unless you're under investigation and it's a multi-signed agreement backed up by a smart contract. The bank or investors can check your credit rating, but not your financial history, assets or any other data that can give them an advantage over you. Another case: what happens when you die. If all your money and assets are under your blockchain ID, then when a coroner declares you dead, all your assets, unless you have a "smart will", will automatically be split among your heirs.

Banking has become so automated that you don't need to visit a bank anymore, so they're cutting job positions. Customers have lost being a priority, and the bank is focused on offering credits and mutual funds, or offering to increase the limits of your credit card and your overdraft limits (which increases the monthly fees they charge).

For BTC to become stable, people have to start using it like cash. It's still in the adoption process, so a bunch of merchants have to sacrifice themselves with the price changes for some time. Remember when the internet had to be accessed on a 5600 baud modem over the phone? Now you can have 1gbps for dedicated residential connections. What happened?: Adoption and the needs that had to be solved because of the masification.

The main benefit of bitcoin is that achieves the separation of money from controlling institutions or governments. So the value of it is determined by the successful uses of bitcoin exchanging goods or services.
Also it reduces the possibility of fraud or corruption. If it's used by a government, the public accounts for each senator, or politician can be audited for its transactions. You can know who's financing them, and where the money is going. No more private donations or money used for lobbying and buying politicians. The government can also collect taxes, and people can audit that collection and movement of money. (no more terrorist funding programs disguised as classified operations).
Also the trust provided by the verifications makes commerce safer. A business running a node can verify their transactions and avoid being a victim of fraud. (like credit card fraud or falsified money).

There's no need to put pressure on the banks. If any commerce starts gradually accepting cryptocurrencies, people will naturally shift to use it when they see the benefits. They'll cease the need for banks and as any other business, they will transform the services or die. Remember what happened to blank cassette tapes when blank cds appeared on the market?

maybe IoT machines that uses IOTA as a currency to mantain themselves and negotiate with other machines, could be rented or bought with money from btc to iota, keeping the economies separated. Human to machine, and machine to machine.

That's where smart contracts come in place. A business wouldn't use a simple wallet for transactions, it probably will be a multisignature one, with several permission levels: the accountant reserves the money, the general manager approves the transaction, the owner authorizes the transaction. Also other mechanisms could be in place, but they are still not implemented or developed in bitcoin core or third party softwares.

any digital currency can work for that purpose, but the idea behind it is to have separate economies for these purposes.

Loss appears when you have people committing fraud with credit cards, or counterfeit money. With bitcoin this is really hard to do. Even for theft on the store, if someone manages to hack you or get your private keys by gunpoint, insurance can be helpful there, which happens with credit cards, they have a insurance policy attached in case of fraud, and most of the time they need a culprit, so there's not too different there.
And about wanting an example of btc being central to business, that's like asking to provide a successfull example of email marketing when email is still being developed.
We're talking about adoption, and Bitcoin still has a long way to go in terms of development, security and ease of use. There's still missing some form of privacy, vanity addresses, easy to set up nodes, one click installs, etc.
Even in the times that email was being deployed massively, marketers and companies saw little use for email because of its limited capabilites to attach images or customized layouts to communicate offers, and it was more suited for internal communications.

Bitcoin Nodes and LN nodes should be run by merchants and shop owners. That's all we need for adoption and to strengthen the network.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:09:36
The mainstream users are like monkeys, because they will copy what they see is being used effectively and it's better than what they already have. So adoption will come when you can see people paying with bitcoin on a store, a restaurant, a cafe or whatever small shop you use daily. They will see people paying with their cellphone or a wrist band, even with nfc implants. Merchants on the street selling with QR codes, or beggars using QR codes to request money, like they do in china with AliPay or WeChat. Savings come later when you see that your purchasing power increases and you can get things cheaper or in a combo, because merchants will want to give better deals to be competitive and earn money.
What's missing for adoption is easier ways to use BTC and to implement it to sell stuff, more security and vanity addresses to be able to have more trust when sending money to another wallet.

It's about the security that gives you to run a node. It's more logical that the owners of a  business run nodes to make sure their payments are valid. The paradigm on how the economy is run changes with bitcoin, since it's detached from a particular institution, and shifts to everyone who's using the technology.

The thing that should be implemented is privacy, not anonymity. Everyone likes to look at this subject of anonymity from their own standpoint and the belief that "I'm not doing anything wrong or illegal", however the reality is that some people will try to use bitcoin to launder money, hide their income, divert funds or whatever unregulated thing corporations, rich people or politicians do to reduce the amount of taxes to pay. With privacy you keep civilians from looking into your funds or your expenses, and allow transparency to work through regulated and trusted institutions. (tax collectors, auditors, police, etc).
