That's pretty much a condensed way to do dollar cost averaging but instead of spreading out over a few periods, you spread it out over just a couple.
In terms of a better chance, I assume you mean at profiting, the answer is ... maybe :) 
If the price falls between the two periods, you lose money on the first buy but may see larger profits on the second buy when it goes back up. If the price increases between buys, you make some from your first buy but then lose potential profit on the second buy.
Hope I answered your question!

I don't see why you would need to transfer back to Coinbase, but am not sure. I guess it doesn't hurt since it's free and instant but I wouldn't do it :)

Ah yes you're correct! I read it wrong and thought it was mentioned to move the USD back to Coinbase (oops).
In terms of BTC, sell on GDAX every time yes!

For P2P selling, depending on which wallet, you go to your wallet software and should have the ability to send the bitcoin. No different from sending it on an exchange other than the interface.
If you're trying to sell to the exchange, then yes you send to "your" wallet address of the exchange and then can sell for fiat.

If you have a coinbase account, you will automatically have a gdax account. 
Go to [GDAX]( and you should see a small "deposit" and "withdraw" button. Press deposit and there should be another tab that says "coinbase account".
From there you can choose an amount to transfer and it will instantly move over. No need for a btc address!

This is the right answer. Coinbase charges a fee for transfers while gdax (on the btc network at least) does not

No point waiting, you'll miss out on potential profits. Dollar cost averaging is the answer and always the better strategy in terms of hedging your risks.

I'm sorry to hear about this, definitely sucks. If you're not making headway with coinbase support, there's not much anyone here can do sadly. I would recommend getting registered with a new exchange and using their platform. Sorry!
