I agree with some of what you're saying
bitcoin is more than just a volatile "pump and dump" asset.
There is real, legitimate, unique value in using a blockchain to track ownership of tokens, and by having the largest-use, longest established network, bitcoin has the highest fundamental value of any cryptocurrency/asset.
Will BTC work like cash one day?  Maybe.  That would be enormous if it happens.  IF no major technical innovations occur, BTC still remains a cheap, easy, ***uncensorable*** transfer of value between parties that don't have to know or trust each other.  There is value in that -- there is no better way than bitcoin (for instance) to buy and sell black/grey market goods, or to transfer a million dollars internationally (bonus points for needing secrecy).
While I agree nobody should be surprised, and BTC isn't a good long term investment strategy, I think speculation is reasonable.  I think there's *no way in hell* that there isn't a strong fundamental valuation for BTC for only its use as an international money transfer method or as a black market currency.

How is anyone surprised?
This isn't anyone's fault either lol, it's a volatile asset.
If you're surprised, upset, concerned, *you're doing it wrong*, and you should sell and sit out.

You're simply wrong.
There was never any systematic or widespread violation of net neutrality principles before they were enforced by the government.  That in and of itself is an indictment of the position that claims there must exist some regulation -- there is no evidence of a problem that needed solving.
If an ISP tried to limit your network access, you could easily use a VPN to circumvent their discrimination.  It's fundamentally not plausible to claim they have the means or incentive to actually do this.
With respect to Bitcoin and block chain technologies, permitting internet infrastructure companies to cater to different traffic differently could allow for the development of unique network infrastructure that supports block chain networks, infrastructure that would not be built otherwise.

If any community should oppose net neutrality, it's advocates of up and coming technologies like block chain.

Ok poetic justice blah blah.
Bitcoin is great for money laundering and other illegal activity.  That's just a fact.  That's one of the fundamental reasons it has value in the first place.

How does the blockchain know you control the public key / address?
