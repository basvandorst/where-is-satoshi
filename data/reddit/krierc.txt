Do some research, Trace is one of the most well spoken people in the crypto world. His economic analysis are top notch. He is definitely not a pump and dumper.

Because everything in the traditional financial system is designed around a pull system (I can pull a transaction out of your credit card account if I steal your numbers) and currencies are based on a push system, cyrpto transactions are permanent and cannot be reversed. So if Coinbase lets you take your coins off the platform early, you could simply call your bank and claim you did not authorize the transactions and they would pull the $$$ transactions back. Hence you would end up with free coins. So Coinbase locks you out for 7 days.

I agree, it is a really cool design, but I just can not grasp the use cases. The $10-12 price makes it unrealistic for small transactions and for large ones I'm worried about losing it. Every time there is a news story about them I go to their website because I have to have one.....but then I stall and can not think of one case where I want it. For a $200 transaction I"m paying ~%6 for the OD plus the transaction fee to load it up. Plus the person who gets it has to pay the transaction fee to unload it. That is a significant amount of fees. I'm not willing to put much more then a few hundred $ on it because of possible loss/theft/bad hardware....etc. It is really neat though :/

I currently live on a yacht and have thought about BTC names a lot. You need one that does not broadcast wealth in BTC (you sail into poor areas with a lot of petty crime, pretty common for the wealthy looking boats to get robbed) but rather a name that has a subtle nod to BTC. This one is perfect!!!

If mining becomes unprofitable the miners shut down there machines. Then the block time slows, and then the mining difficultly will will adjust lower, then mining becomes profitable again. The difficultly adjust every so many blocks.

I'm sure they will do some sort of multi signature setup to account for this.

2% inflation per year is 50% every 35 years, so roughly 50% every generation....it adds up quick!

I'm setting up my China and India suppliers to accept bitcoins and in a few weeks my company will be accepting bitcoins. That "if" is already starting to happen!

Kept all mine, decided a long time ago that I was a terrible day trader.  I believe in the long term future of bitcoins, so I figure the best thing for both me and the bitcoin community is to just ride the bubbles out.  We don't need any more volatility.
