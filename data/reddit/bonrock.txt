BU is an attack on Bitcoin. Plain and simple. It is likely funded by altcoin holders, but this is not known and only speculation.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:36:11
I love that I keep seeing others point this out. We need to continue to speak up and expose them for who they are!
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:18:36
Your argument would have more credibility if Bitcoin Core auto-updated, which it does not. Because it does not, each user consciously upgrades. The act of consciously upgrading to the latest Bitcoin Core expresses support for Segwit. How is this not clear to you?
If someone was against Segwit, they could upgrade by choosing to run BU. That's their right. They also have the right to be mad if at some point they make a BU transaction and end up owning and altcoin instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:27:48


Hah! BU has been dead in the water since day one.

Haha. The noobs you speak of probably instinctively type in bitcoin {dot} com, which ironically tells them to download and use BU. They would have to research alternative clients to find Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:45:30
Yes. Many fail to realize this point. If miners collude for a 51% attack and redefine Bitcoin, my node will simply reject their blocks and ban their IPs. The users of Bitcoin define the rules; not miners. Miners can direct their hash power temporarily to a foolish altcoin if they so choose. They may misjudge who will join them.

I can't wait for the day BU forks off to their altcoin.
Having read too much r/btc and suffered with the constantly negativity, I have a new plan of action.
Instead of selling my BU altcoins after the fork, I'm going to use them to spam the shit out of their chain with near zero fee transactions until every last one is used up.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:50:55

Have you read r/btc?! It's anything but "well meaning Bitcoin enthusiasts and developers"...
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:25:17
You must be joking? A massive sudden spike in low fee transactions completely out of whack with moving averages to create a 40,000+ mempool backlog is just "a lot of users who want to transact"?
I hope some day you wake up and realize you are sided with an enemy of Bitcoin. Hopefully you're not a bitcoin holder too because if so that's really sad. It's the same as betting against yourself. Fortunately there's enough people like me who see through the BS and will prevent BU from ever happening.

Doubt that. Very unlikely possibility, maybe. BU needs more than 51% or even 75% of miner support to become the "real" Bitcoin. It needs market support, which it does not have - just browse r/Bitcoin countless examples of market opposition.
The most likely scenario is that BU will fizzle out and die, otherwise it might fork off. LOL

If you are heavily invested in altcoins, an investment in destroying Bitcoin is an investment in your altcoins. Bitcoin represents 80% market share. This is not childish, but realistic. The best tactic is to pretend to be a "different supporting opinion", while chaos and failure is the behind the scenes goal.

Yes, thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:27:27
The problem is that BU has been masquerading as pro-Bitcoin when, in fact, it's an attack against Bitcoin. BU is very effective at manipulation through populist political rhetoric and this has many casual observers and outsiders confused, while insiders are aware of what's going on.
You are spot on about Bitcoin progress being purely political at this point. Fortunately, Bitcoin works very well as is.
True scaling requires a secondary layer or lightning network eventually regardless of block size increases. It also doesn't make sense for the blockchain to support low-fee micro-transactions.
This is obvious because Bitcoin goes under attack from low fee transactions designed to create a backlog and push a political agenda. This happens every time you see people complain about waiting for confirmations.
If the fee was near zero and the block size allowed to grow indefinitely, the best way to attack Bitcoin would be to spam pointless low fee transactions which translates to data that must be validated and stored across tens of thousands of computers. Then, this database of bullshit grows indefinitely large so that only centralized data-centers run nodes and control is back in the hands of the few instead of the many.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:48:36
Troll harder please... Sending lightning transactions will be as easy as sending bitcoin. Both will become even easier as better methods are discovered in the future.

Miners who mine within the existing rules will be fine.
Miners who misjudge the market support for BU and vote with their hash power may end up mining an altcoin. Good luck to them.
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:50:01
A spam transaction includes a fee that is only a tiny fraction of the current market rate for fees of similar transactions at that time.


No, an abrupt flood of extremely low fee transactions is obviously spam.
The point with LN is to get legitimate low fee/low value transactions off the blockchain by offering the next best thing.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:23:38

Fork off with your altcoin please. Globally distributed Bitcoin blockchain is not going to store your micro transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:26:06
Yes, this is true and does in fact work. Also, if you run your node through TOR &amp; your local IP, you already have two nodes for the price of one. VPS services rent additional IP addresses for hardly any extra cost. One computer can run 20 fake nodes easily and 1000 fake nodes with the proper adversarial funding.

Generally, r/btc and BU attracts Bitcoin haters from all walks of life. Some of them are probably Ethereum holders, yes.  They realize no altcoin will every be successful while Bitcoin represents 80%+ market share. Greed is a wonderful motivator.

With widespread adoption, a typical home user will not run a home node even if the cost is zero. The reason is because they aren't tech savvy or interested and generally want to simplify their lives.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:37:06
Each time a user opens their node, it must connect to a listening node to get the latest blocks. The listening node sees this new connection and adds it to a count.


Yes, these nodes come online and go offline in line with user behavior.


The time frame varies, but you would want to use a time frame that captures the majority of users. Maybe a significant amount of users only sync their nodes once per month on average. I don't know.


I don't know all the details as I'm not actually doing this.
However: Run a listening node with port-forwarding so anyone can connect to it. Set your max connections as high as you feel comfortable so that as many other nodes connect to you as possible. Use bitcoin-cli commands like "getpeerinfo" to gather information.
Of course node counts can be faked through Sybil attack, but it's worth noting that the Sybil attack and the true users are represented in the total count. It's only their percentages that is unknown.

Here you are trolling hard again trying so hard to sound reasonable and technical. Further economics speculation along these lines may lead you to believe that inflation beyond 21M is necessary and should be added as a feature. Hopefully not.
The great irony is we all know increased transaction throughput from larger blocks is a good thing, so long as it doesn't degrade decentralization. This is why Segwit is an effective block size increase to 2-4mb depending on transaction mix.

@_date: 2017-02-10 16:09:16
Can you argue for bigger blocks without having to argue for future perpetual increases?
No. A one time increase would surely become "full" again, possibly quite soon. This requires another increase. Thus, it can only be reasoned that the future size is unbound.
Surely you know the way to scale is by other means and not by storing more and more micro transactions on a globally distributed database, which coincidentally increases the cost to operate a node, and thus leads to centralization, effectively destroying Bitcoin's censorship resistance?
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:43:23
Hate due to a difference in opinion is unjustified and make rbtc and BU supporters look like trolls IMO. Also because BU is heavily supported by centralizing Chinese mining interest, that should be another warning. We should always be critical of hard forks that miners are pushing. Miner's are a main player in the balance of power. It's not wise to grant them more. Lukejr's tone may be trollish, but his lone dissenting voice is healthy criticism.

I feel those invested in altcoins or for profit companies with certain business models have a financial incentive to block Segwit &amp; stall Bitcoin progress.
First, pushing this HF drama has dropped the exchange rate price of BTC by over 20%. Not coincidentally, altcoins have boomed.
Second, Segwit script version is the upgrade that enables all other upgrades.
Third, altcoins betting on faster transactions or private transactions will be destroyed by Segwit + LN + Schnorr sigs + Confidential Transactions.
This is what all of this is about IMO. Short-term greed by big players in the industry. It's a sad reality.

You don't get it do you? It's not some mining race to 51% or 75% or whatever and then there's a magical winner. Miners have to retain this hash power indefinitely. That might be difficult if they see the value plummet over time in favor of the original chain.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:38:23
This is absolutely incorrect. You have it exactly backwards. How typical of you.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:26:22
What's happening here is miner signaling for BU, but staying within consensus. They aren't actually mining according the BU's new rules. The 1.1MB invalid block you're talking about was due to a bug in the BU software which accidentally produced an invalid block. This just shows the incompetency of their development.

You are correct, but once you factor in a paid Sybil attack, you have a scenario of all voices silenced but ONE. Sub moderation is a good thing. The beauty of decentralization is that another sub (albeit an anti-Bitcoin troll sub) r/btc does exist.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:21:51
The only crashes I've ever experienced resulted in me discovering a bad stick of RAM or a failing hard drive. Maybe an unstable system in general. Bitcoin Core seems to be very effective at testing my hardware stability!
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:30:53
A miner is compensated for finding a block with a reward (bitcoin inflation) and fees (of the transactions looking to be confirmed). The block reward is halving every 4 years until it reaches zero. This coincides with the 21 million bitcoin limit. Because bitcoin does not inflate indefinitely, miners must rely on fees for most of their revenue.
Thus, you are competing for the first confirmation based on your transaction fee relative to others in the market at that same moment. This is why, as you say, it "might take a bit of time" for the first confirmation. After the first confirmation, you gain an additional confirmation each time a new block is found. As others have said, it varies, but on average it's 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:57:01
Yes. Increasing the block size requires more powerful machines with larger hard drives and better internet connections. This affects miners as well as full nodes. To what degree depends on the block size. Segwit, released by Core, is an effective block size increase to ~2mb.
BU wants to redefine consensus and hand miners more power and control, hence why BU is pushed by miners in China. Their software running on a miner accidentally mined a block greater than 1mb, which currently breaks consensus, and was rejected by the network. They lost ~13.5 BTC in reward and fees. Reckless and foolish indeed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:07:36


No. BU changes protocol consensus into a flexible and likely gameable block size. This is new experimentation and in my opinion, will lead to disaster.

The fact that you think you know how it works, but clearly don't, and yet are so adamant about it, is very perplexing.
Miners follow value. If miners fork only to release they are mining a worthless altcoin, they will switch back. In the meantime, transaction processing on the original chain may slow down a bit, but nothing will be lost. The only thing is lost is transactions made on the altcoin chain that end up being worthless when it's all said and done.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:53:10

@_date: 2017-03-11 08:05:12
Well, there is clearly market consensus which places value to Bitcoin through price discovery. There is also miner consensus, which I called "protocol" consensus. Maybe that's wrong, but regardless, there are two ways to think about consensus, and to deny this is to remain ignorant. Miners follow market value, not vice-versa.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:38:12
Indeed. I fear the total value of both chains after the fork will be much less than prior to the fork. I will definitely participate in selling my BU altcoins for original chain if the fork happens. This scenario is a total disaster in the short-term and exactly what altcoin holders want.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:16:40
Ok, I'll agree to disagree. Majority hash power attacking Bitcoin is indeed not good and may require a hard fork to a new algorithm. At least this hard fork resembles Bitcoin's prior hard fork motive: forking for security from attack. Maybe activation will be quick. We'll see how it plays out...

It's said to be "flexible" because miners can adjust the limit on a whim. It is also no limit, so you are right. Regardless, it's highly experimental and likely gameable, which will lead to disaster.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:44:29
Under what condition is "no transaction allowed on a network"?
I'll move my BU altcoins to an exchange paying little to no fee due to the unlimited block size, while my BTC remains safely on the original chain.
Then, I'll sell my BU altcoins for original chain bitcoins on the exchange paying the usual exchange fee.
Finally, I'll request to withdrawal these original chain bitcoins to my cold wallets. The exchange may have to pay a very high fee (due to drop in hash rate &amp; difficulty retarget) but as long as it is a appropriate, my coins will eventually be confirmed.
Notice how my original chain bitcoins did not move?

I think that describing it as a private central bank with owners profiting attracts the populist socialist more-so than another "wonderful" government agency "helping". These are people who especially need to wake up.
I shoot myself in the foot by shitting on their believe that government can do no wrong and is essentially "God".

You are clueless. Good luck with your BU altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:01:33
I'm not sold on EC. It's highly experimental and has not been proven in the market. Many argue it gives centralized miners an advantage, especially centralized miners colluding in China with high latency to the rest of the world. They can set the block size high and give themselves an advantage as it takes even longer to relay found blocks to miners outside of China. Block propagation is another aspect to scaling. I'd feel better if EC tech was deployed and successful on an altcoin for a few years, then considered in Bitcoin.
The fact EC exists in another repo beyond Core proves there is decentralization in development. The next step is building consensus. Core appears to be in control simply because most market participants have trusted and continue to trust them. I am one of them. Decentralization in development surely isn't forcing a group of developers to act against what they believe is their best interest?
Many Core devs wanted Segwit without an effective block size, but the current proposal includes one to 2-4mb. So, not even Core is in total agreement with itself.


Which alternative are you referring to? It can't possibly be BU as that has been riddled with bugs as recently as last week.
Edit: typo &amp; slight clarification

Dude, get a clue.
You are sending BTU to BTU in your example. Just because the addresses work the same, doesn't mean the balance shows up.
You think you are so clever, but really you are not even correcting me. You are answering an entirely different question.

LOL What are you even talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:02:05


Interesting. I don't think I would support this as it's basically an ugly hack of BU.
I think you are wrong about how easily miners in collusion can kill the original chain. If a fork occurs, two coins will be listed on exchanges, and price discovery over time is the consensus that determines which chain is Bitcoin. Miners may temporarily be wrong and ultimately switch back once this is realized.
I'll be one of the speculators who sells my BU altcoins for original chain bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:27:15
Ok friend. We'll meet again on the exchanges. I'll beat you there though!

LOL keep up the great work! I can't stand this troll and you have made it entertaining!
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:28:14
You nailed it. I've moved my coins to cold wallets. After the fork I'll be sending my BU altcoins on the forked BU protocol to whichever exchange supports both. My original bitcoins will ignore these transactions as included within invalid blocks. I'll send the BU transaction with low fees and quick confirmation due to the "unlimited" block size. Meanwhile, BU fanboys will struggle to send their original bitcoins to exchanges due to panicked backlog, slow confirmations from difficulty retargeting. While their transaction is confirming, I'm selling my BU altcoin to another BU fanboy first before they have had their ability to drive the price of original chain bitcoins down. By the time they even get their bitcoins on to exchanges, the value of BU altcoins will have collapsed. Dead on arrival. LOL
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:42:32
Don't let emotion or greed influence your decision making. I bought around $400 on the way down from the 2013 top, suffered through a year or more of being down 50%, now I only regret not buying more at the time.
Edit: meant to reply to AlexHM. Sorry RustyNomad!
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:44:20
It's called strategy. Maybe he wants to use his "official pool" to push the hash near or over 50% quickly, but the opportunity hasn't happened, and likely never will.
He has also fooled you with this tactic by manipulating your perception of him, but just look at his words written about Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:41:40


I get it. You're just a troll adding confusion instead of clarity.

LOL - You apparently have no idea about the difference between market consensus and protocol consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:02:02


LOL - How disingenuous to say BU isn't a hard fork because miners are currently only signaling support for it, and not actually using the BU protocol. Have another down-vote.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:55:44
Segwit is an effective block size increase to 1.7-2.1mb based on current transaction mix. The crowd you are referring to wants control, not just a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:50:18
It's not.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:32:18
Because the hard fork will be contentious - that's why.
The ETF filing reads that whichever chain is the longest/most work after 48hrs becomes what investors bought, while the other chain is ?discarded?
I'll be dumping my BU altcoins for original chain bitcoins as soon as the chains diverge in this fork event.
I'm not remotely as afraid of 4-8MB blocks as I am of a highly experimental "flexible" block size that shifts more power to miners, will likely be gameable, and could end in disaster.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:23:45
This is glaringly obvious. Anyone who continues to look past it arguing Ver is somehow a good guy makes me want to puke...

This branch is 1072 commits ahead, 3437 commits behind bitcoin:master.
Sorry buddy, you're wrong. They aren't merging anything from master. They're just renaming variables and redefining consensus into a flexible and likely gameable block size.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:46:55
This is speculation without any proof. It's also possible Roger sold every bitcoin he once owned and diversified into altcoins, which he actively pumps.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:57:30
The beauty is that their obvious down-voting Sybil attack can be claimed to be "individual users expressing their opinion" and cannot be proven otherwise.
Anyone without malicious intent or dumb ignorance knows r/btc and BU are an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:01:18
There are plenty of Ivy-league economists who argue inflation is a requirement for money, otherwise people will save their money instead of spending. Thus, we must encourage them to spend by eroding money's purchasing power.
This same argument applies to transaction fees in Bitcoin. You can inflation indefinitely, eroding the purchasing power of holders, to benefit the spenders with zero fees.
Is this not the next logical step for unlimited on-chain scaling???
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:58:47
BU is a designed attack against Bitcoin by its adversaries. This is very obvious. BU supporters are altcoin holders wishing the price of Bitcoin will go down. This is why they troll even harder when the price is rising.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:02:36
BU replaces current protocol consensus with a flexible and likely gameable block size. Because of this, existing nodes will not see these blocks as valid Bitcoin blocks. By definition this is an altcoin. 
Experimental flexible block size which puts more power in control of miners has no business being considered as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:55:39
BU programmers are incompetent morons. Accidentally mining a 1.1MB block out of consensus; rejected and banned by all nodes. Hah! Who is the idiot now?
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:28:41
How does Bitcoin exist?

The higher node count is gathered as nodes behind firewall connect to a listening node over time.
Only active listening nodes w/o firewall are shown on online node counters.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:18:10
BU has no intention of implementing segwit. They openly view the Core devs as "evil" and refuse to support any implementation they offer, regardless of technical merit.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:00:06
I held through with no intention of selling as well :-)
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:22:38
In a hypothetical BU fork:
Original chain coins do not have to move from existing cold wallets.
BU altcoins can be transferred to exchanges via the forked BU protocol (which original chain ignores as invalid) using near zero fees due to the unlimited block size.
These BU altcoins can be exchanged to original bitcoins and then withdrawn as per usual.
It is the BU fanboys that may struggle to move original chain coins to exchanges to sell (due to panicked transaction backlog and slow confirmations from delayed difficulty retarget).
In other words, original chain supporters likely have a head start on the price war - the ultimate consensus mechanism - for the reasons you outlined.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:51:52
Clearly you sold out!
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:55:15
Why wouldn't they add say 10% perpetual inflation to be paid to the BU management? They elected a President of BU. The President of BU needs compensation for his valuable work and expertise. Without his guidance, Bitcoin is doomed to fail. Thus, the President of BU should earn 5% inflation going forward. This is for our own benefit everybody! Nobody is going to fork. Besides, we need perpetual inflation to encourage us to spend instead of save. Economics 101. If our money deflates, we will delay all purchases, starve to death, and die in miserably austere conditions. Why do all developed nations have inflation within their national currencies??? /s

I'll be dumping my BU altcoin ASAP.

It's very obvious that you're the idiot here! LOL
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:27:00
You are right about address formatting, but wrong that this alone will allow you to send balance from BTC to BTU after a fork. A transaction must be within a valid block, and hard forks don't agree each other's blocks are valid.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:12:16


Bullshit. Segwit includes an effective block size increase to 2-4mb depending on transaction mix. How is this not on chain scaling?
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:37:02
This is indeed the plan. BU altcoins will be the first to hit exchanges to be sold for original bitcoins. Like he said, original bitcoins are going to have very slow confirmations.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:14:33
The most hilarious part is that once the original chain regains the majority of hash rate, the minority BU chain is immediately abandoned, by BU nodes/miners. The only way around this is to dictate in the code that "BU is the new Bitcoin", and that goes against their "emergent consensus" propaganda - LOL
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:17:22
You likely don't own any bitcoin and are currently an altcoin bag-holder hoping for Bitcoin to fail so your altcoin appreciates.
If not, I'll promise to trade 5 BU altcoins for every 1 of your bitcoins when the fork happens! This is a great deal especially given your level of confidence!
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:51:30
The only way it can be solved is for BU to fork off with their BU altcoin and run their flexible and gameable block size experiment with someone else's money. This is contentious and will never be implemented within Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:43:29
This is a painful lesson in patience. Best advice is to acknowledge that it's in a breakout bubble and that you might be too late (unless you're a gambler willing to chase). No one knows where the top is.
From the top of the bubble, it will likely correct 60% of the way back to the start of the breakout on extreme panic selling. I would wait to buy here. The price may be higher or lower than now, but the timing is surely better.

The downvoting is due to your shitty attitude FYI. People hold bitcoin because they believe bitcoin is better money than government fiat. For this to be proven true, the price of bitcoin in fiat will rise.
The debate over a gold standard, inflation/deflation, etc is not as settled as you may think. There are many people with titles beyond (Redditor for zero days) associated with the Austrian school of economic thought who will attest to this.

Savings plays a good role in society, but one that's hard to measure. For example, individual free time is a by-product of savings. This stems creativity, innovation, small business growth. Great inventions have been made by average Joe's with savings. Because of their savings they weren't forced to work overtime just to pay bills and interest on debt. Nobody with zero capital and tons of debt is thinking about the next great technological invention...
Interest from holding a deflationary currency will never outpace investment in business in aggregate over the long term. It's true during periods of uncertainty money will move into currency, but this is not a fault of the money, rather the external factor causing the uncertainty (eg: War).
If economic stimulus was meant to "benefit everybody", why write the check to select banks, corporations, foreign governments? Why not write a check to each and every citizen. Inflationary monetary policy, as we both agree, insures every recipient will spend every cent anyway - benefiting the economy!
How does insuring poor business decisions with bailouts promote good business decisions in the future? If anything, it encourages reckless decision-making.
Please stop apologizing on behalf of central bankers. Bitcoin is here to challenge that monetary policy.
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:31:50
Judging by your alias, I'm sure you'll argue Monero is the far superior currency...
While altcoins may have niche use cases, they wont likely replace Bitcoin's 87% current market dominance as Bitcoin can theoretically adopt any of their breakthrough features with consensus.
Consensus being achieved to avoid life-threatening decline is much different than consensus over the current block size debate.
Your point about scaling is also a bit ironic. Bitcoin has many years to scale to serve the whole world. That's how growth works.

It reads hard fork in 6 months; segwit if miners signal &gt;80%. Basically 2mb hard fork, but segwit is not going to happen. DOA.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:13:39
Segwit has to be rewritten to activate on a new version bit so there will be delays and I'm willing to bet it will not kill ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:31:30
You may be right. I'm a skeptic until the code is out and reviewed, as I should be. Trusting protocol development to backroom deals with major players licking their greedy chops at every opportunity entirely destroys Bitcoin's value proposition as a trust-less decentralized currency. When this agreement falls apart and Segwit is activated as it is by the threat of UASF, then Bitcoin's value proposition is reaffirmed.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:25:56
Changes to code require new peer review, however minimal. Why not activate vetted and well-tested Segwit as it is currently? Because activating segwit is not the goal, hard forking is. Hence the agreement does not activate segwit, only reduces the threshold to 80%, but this does not mean miner's will signal. This is DOA. I wish it wasn't true.
