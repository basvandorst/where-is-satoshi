I felt weird not having any coin the last 2 months, but I just bought 2.5 btc on circle two hours ago and I feel better now.
Now to keep buying more and hodl like I used to. If people like me who have been out but have almost always been in come back like I did....moon.

So far got a speedy and helpful email from admin, sent him the transaction ID for the initial deposit. there might be a light at the end of the tunnel, fingers crossed.

Just got a super speedy response again from admin, looks like this was probably my fault from what I can gather with me just submitting to another address or something. By looking up the transaction on the blockchain he was able to verify what I was saying and behold my 1.41505 btc have returned to my wallet.
TL;DR: bitcoinvideocasino.com is the real deal, admin is quick and helpful, I'm just a big dummy, so money much coin

Not on tor. iOS to play and then I always connect to my PC to cash out using my unique url, password protection, and fixed wallet withdrawl address. I'd cash out from my phone but the cash out button doesn't fit in the screen on my phone.

I've had success with them for weeks now, but never bet that high until now.
I didn't bother sending an email because I just assumed this was how they make their money, by pretending to be legitimate until a full btc is in the game, and they simply take it from you. Now that it's been 6 or more hours since it happened, I doubt they would do anything, guess it doesn't hurt to try!
