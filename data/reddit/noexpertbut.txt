I don’t like Big Macs, but I like speculating on random shit, so I bought them.  The first McDonald’s I went to sold me 15 on different transactions with no questions asked.  The rest of them insisted on one per customer.  So I had to go to five cities to find the remaining 10 coins.  It took about three hours.  I’m counting on McDonald’s to make an announcement or something to make the coins more valuable than a Big Mac.  If not, oh well.  Too answer your questions, I just bought the coins, though the first McDonald’s gave me a vanilla coffee and one employee told me he would eat the sandwich so I gave that one to him.

I was able to purchase 25 today, because none of the many McDonalds near me were sold out, and they do no advertising of the promotion outside of the online commercial.  I can tell you that these cannot be counterfeited.  I put one of them between my teeth, in the way that old-timers might check a gold coin, and it tasted just like Big Mac.  I know of no treasury that is able to replicate this.  Full disclosure, I was eating a Big Mac when I bit into the coin, so tasting results may vary.

Yeah, I thought about asking them to sell me more, but I didn’t know which ones I was even getting.  I didn’t get any 1998-2008 and I asked two McDonald’s to search all of their coins for me (I showed them four and told them I just needed that one more).  So I think it’s the “rare” coin or maybe it’s just not available in my area.  I like the hippy flower-child (78?) and the internet emoji ones (2008-18).
