This is a little bit old news, but it's still cool. I work a few blocks north, across the street from the NY Fed branch (at a bitcoin startup), and I've gone to a few of the trading nights. Most of the week they offer Bitcoin trading classes, but on Monday nights starting at 6 it opens up as a trading floor.

Were you at the front desk yesterday? I may have run into you.

We're close to there; I go to the Chinese food cart for lunch a lot.

Sure, no problem with getting the word out early, though I'm not saying the name because we don't have the full website up yet. 
So the company was started by a bunch of ex-finance guys who wanted to do simple, easy to use bitcoin products for the everyday person, plus bitcoin finance systems (trading, investment, escrow services etc.) The idea is to have everything linked together through a single site, so you can useyour wallet, check stocks and news and access a community all from the same place. 
As for the timeline, the launch is supposed to be within a month or two. Mind, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel, just perfect it, so more ambitious or technologically advanced ideas might take longer.
And yeah, they started in December. Good guess.

As soon as I saw the headline I knew it would be Polis. He's been on the side of freedom from day one; he was one of the most outspoken opponents of SOPA/PIPA, and I hear about him a lot standing up for privacy and internet rights.
EDIT: Opponent, not supporter. Thanks tetondon.

They offer bitcoin classes for $500 a piece, and a "masters" class for $1500. The trading only happens on Monday nights, but I assume they make a fee from that too. I work a few blocks from there (at a bitcoin startup), and I checked it out last night. I don't have the flyer for the classes but I can go get another one if people are interested.

I had a lot of fun myself, and got to buy some dogecoin in exchange for video games. Looking forward to going back when I'm not so busy. 
We're keeping the startup under wraps for now until we launch. Thanks for asking though!

Just watched the pilot last night. I'm liking it so far, even if they could use a futurist or two. Also the music from Dorian's awakening scene is Smile by the Crystal Method, which made me very happy.
