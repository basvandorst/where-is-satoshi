maybe sell 25% or some other percentage of your holdings, that's what I did at other milestones (but.. I subsequently regretted it of course).. but it helps reduce potential regret if it ever crashes

it's a cheap(ish) LED display, I recall I paid around $150 for it years ago.. it's RS232, but you can either get a usb adapter for it, or an ethernet-&gt;RS232... I originally used USB, but now it just sits on my network over ethernet
Once it's connected, you just need a small script to fetch data, I currently get mid-market rates from a couple of exchanges, then push the packets to the display.
Most LED displays follow a similar protocol, and there's a handful of libraries you can use to send data, this is the one I'm using currently: 
Then I just have it run every minute during the day, but in the morning I also have it shown the times for the next few trains for my commute.. and also have it setup so Alexa can display data on there too

already removed spaces.. I guess I could have it scrolling, or just show smaller symbols :)

every transaction is public, so yes, anything can be tracked. Of course you need to know who owns the source and destination address.
