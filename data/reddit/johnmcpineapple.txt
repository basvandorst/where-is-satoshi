Dollars are used to buy drugs too, do they fall under no tolerance policy too!?

Currency is just an artificial good to simplify and control barter, there will be neither the need nor the time for that immediately after an apocalypse.

That's certainly a cheap donut.

Is bitcoin.de recommendable? I used to use Kraken but they require sketchy verification from German residents lately.

I've only had one experience with their support but it was a good one. They answered my support mail asking about having a list of upvoted songs in the radio function, saying there currently isn't one but they will pass along that idea. A couple months after that this function was implemented.

There are local wallets that don't download the blockchain? Which one? I currently use Bitcoin Core, I tested Armory once but it did, in addition of requiring a running Bitcoin Core, download what seemed like another instance of the entire blockchain.

I mined a good amount of dogecoin in its beginning that were worth over a thousand euros at the time. Now the same amount is worth a mere 100 euros. I kept them in blind hope but for quite some time now I just didn't care anymore. Good thing I never invested any money in them, I don't see Dogecoin going anywhere.

A system would develop that resembles a form of government of some sort. That's what inevitably happens when many people share a certain space. But way less bureaucratic initially.

Killing Gaddafi and thereby instigating the uprise of ISIS was Hillarys doing. It built upon what happened before obviously but it could have gone a very different direction if handled differently.

*Do* spend it. Spend it and immediately buy back the amount you've spent. That way you don't loose out *and* you're contributing to the value of the currency.

"If you don't pay me more than initially agreed upon, *against* company rules, I'll ensure you'll never get service again" sounds like blackmail.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:07:44


I disagree.


I'm not talking about selling for dollars. I'm talking about exchanging for products. Using it as an active currency.
When Bitcoin is not used, the only value it holds is speculative. And purely speculative value is *not* going to rise forever. 
Why do you assume the demand for Bitcoin would remain the same if nobody used it?
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:10:22


It's controlled by the small circle of main contributers to core and the corporations that invested millions funding them. Don't act like anyone else has a say about its development. Otherwise that small circle would have shown at least a sign of listening to critique.
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:33:54


Wrong, it's not that simple. All you can do is submit pull requests, which the maintainers have to review and accept - or reject. Which makes sense to weed out bugged or malicious code, but it also enables the core maintainers to control the direction of the development.


It's not an extraordinary claim, it's simply how the GitHub repository works - see the paragraph above. Certain people who had direct commit access also have been revoked that ability - by core - because they didn't share the same views.


The users simply download any wallet that gives them access to the Bitcoin Blockchain, I don't see how that's relevant.
