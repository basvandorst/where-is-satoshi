With the IRS deeming bitcoin "property," will all of these requirements still be necessary?
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:06:33
Sooo it's the darknet. .?
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:31:50
Cool story bro!
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:12:13
If anything, bitcoin 2.0
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:04:05
Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:34:14
If it's too early to sell, then it isn't too late to buy. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:56:54
Because bitcoin works on consensus of the network. One person cannot just update it. If the majority doesn't agree on it, it won't be implemented.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:20:52


You should probably should've read a little more. I haven't seen Gox referred to as "the best" in at least a year.
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:16:18
If the creator(s) even had the ability to disappear with everyone's coins, the value would drop to 0.. So this would accomplish what exactly? smh. They're just trying to spread FUD because they're scared.
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:26:38
Oh hey bitcoin is at the end of their commercials now. Look at that!
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:18:53
We haven't. I just announced it.
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:24:16
Don't get me wrong, I am too. I'm not claiming bitcoin is going to 10 million, but waking up every day and seeing despair isn't too fun. It's nice to see people optimistic again.
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:35:48
4 minutes? I watched for 4 hours.

Last time I checked he wasn't a "large recognized charity." Not that I'm saying we should just throw money to someone if we aren't sure who they are. But the Dorian donations didn't seem to follow the rules either.

Regulators are already tossing around the idea of making tumblers illegal because "they serve no purpose except for illegal activity." 
How they would do this, I'm not sure. I'd imagine if you send your coins to an "unregistered" address you may get a visit? Who knows
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:03:54
Unless they backdoored bitcoin's encryption method and could seize anyone's funds that way..

Why can't you now? Lol my cell phone contact wasn't up, but I found someone on craigslist to trade their galaxy s4 for my iPhone straight up. Just met at the Verizon store and got the services switched. There's a lot of people that want to trade their droids for iPhones. Best trade I ever made.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:42:18
Mycelium does this beautifully. Scan private key to paper wallet, scan address to wallet you want to transfer coins to, and boom. Done.
Just hit the menu button on android phone and select child storage.

@_date: 2014-04-03 19:12:25
TBH, I'm kind of disappointed. I was hoping they would just outright ban it so we could be done with them. Now this leaves us open for more despair if they do end up all out banning it.

They sure do have some badass designers..
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:36:48
Very nice. Only in the bitcoin community do people give away valuable stuff so consistently. Thank you thank you! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:38:37
How can you be in the process of successfully recovering them? You either have the private key or you don't?

But it was perfectly fine when Andreas wanted to raise bitcoins for Dorian?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:08:36
I don't see how ANY news could possibly be worse for the market? The general public and media had already accepted the money and coins on mt gox to be gone. More FUD. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:14:12
The protocol is still the same. If bitcoin drops below 100, I'm selling my truck and taking out a loan.
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:02:54
Well, looks like I need to buy a bitcoin hoodie before my next flight. Because fuck it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:56:14
So much yes. I just donated $5 to something and it was so easy. This is what bitcoin is all about. Not in person retail.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:05:05
Not if I have anything to do with it.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:12:59
Why not use snail mail over email?
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:34:30
I dunno, maybe because the owner is pro-bitcoin..?
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:56:46
FUCK apple. I was such a loyal customer for so many years. I've had 4 iPhones and a MacBook. Love my MacBook. Loved my iPhones. But I just switched to android a few weeks ago. The ONLY reason I switched is because apple keeps banning all the good bitcoin wallets. They can't stop bitcoin, all they're doing is pushing customers away and putting themselves behind in the game. I have no plans to buy another iPhone until I can use one to spend my bitcoin without jumping through hoops. gg Apple, you lose.

If that piece of paper is encrypted and in a safety deposit box or a fire proof safe bolted to the ground, then yeah, I'd say so.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:58:24

Welcome to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:27:29
Funny. I was joking with a buddy of mine saying I had an idea for THE killer bitcoin app.. 
At the strip club, put a large QR code at the front of the stage. A different one for each stripper. You load up your "make it rain bitcoin" app, scan the QR code, and you're ready to make it rain on them hoes. 
With the app open, you walk up to the stage, hold your smartphone in one hand, and with your other hand you swipe the screen over and over (you know, the universal "make it rain" gesture). Each swipe sends one mBTC. 
Maybe set up some sort of green flashing lights on stage that flash every time the stripper gets a milibit. Could even set up some sort of off the blockchain deal to not spam it.. and send all the coins in one transaction at the end of the night
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:20:23
Set and forget..? Ha.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:17:30
Because the bitcoin market is the most skittish thing I've ever seen. And FUD spreads like wildfire, and the naysayers have something out to "prove us wrong."

There's a difference between "governing the market" and governing a person(s) who disappears with a literal shit ton of money.

Honey badger don't give a shit and nothing can stop it. It all originated with this video. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:46:50
you mock the people that say, "This time it's different." If it really was "different," it would crash down to $0. But every time bitcoin has "crashed" it has come back stronger than before.. so I'll agree with you. This time is not different. It is the same as every other time it has crashed.
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:00:35
You're a sweetheart. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:11:17
Hyperdeflation in an economy yes, but hyperinflation in a single asset? Not that I'm comparing bitcoin to a stock, but it is an "asset" of sorts. Was the steep rise in Microsoft, Apple or Tesla stock "fucking bad?" 
No. 
Everyone has their price. I guarantee you if my measly bitcoin holdings rise enough for me to buy a house, I'm buying that house, not hoarding, just as most other people will. Only so many people can make serious money on bitcoin. When it eventually levels off at its "true value," people won't be buying and hoarding it like they do now, but there will be a steep rise before it levels off at its true value. Look at any technology or stock that has taken off.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:06:02
That's how you do it. Have a hiccup, and not only fix it, but come back better than before. Anti-fragile.

No, no, no. Bitcoin is dead. Right..?
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:00:45
Let the fun begin!
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:42:12
This. If the government created it and owned a big share, so what? If they have the power to seize anyone's coins.. This is what should worry people. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:26:18
This is definitely a good reminder. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:59:54
So you want regulation?
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:38:48

To the people screaming "tulip mania!": Can tulips do this?
To Peter Schiff: Can gold do this? If this isn't "intrinsic value," I have no idea what is. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:27:31
not necessarily. the more spread out bitcoins are, the less likely a full out crash will occur. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:14:36
am i the only one that wanted to slap that woman?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:53:52
Fuck you bill. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:06:46
OR.. was silk road 2.0 set up by the government as a "false flag" for an excuse to try n shut bitcoin down? o_O
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:12:23
one more stupid question if i may.. what if something happens to electrum and it ceases to exist, but i still have my string of words? will i be able to use another program to decrypt my private keys or should i copy down the private keys too?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:47:36
agreed. i've already had 2 new friends that i've stirred up some interest in about botcoin. both told me they went to coinbase and saw the price and were like "whoa thats way too much." 
the thing with coinbase is, a noob would have no idea you could buy a fraction of a bitcoin without logging in first. it just says "current buy price: $950" or whatever. think about all the people that don't know anybody that is in to bitcoin and just heard about it on the news and go straight to coinbase to buy some, then see the price and forget about it. 
mBTC ftw. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:30:34
of all the good news of bitcoin spreading like wild fire, i think this might be the best news yet. i think the only thing that really could have slowed bitcoin down was the US trying to make it illegal to use here.. but this, this is GREAT news. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:28:44


this would be so badass on a t-shirt. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:06:26
i bought 1BTC at 12:35am Nov 5 (late monday night). says pending and my bitcoin would arrive today. still no bitcoin.. lol i paid $238 for it and they're now up to almost $338. they took the money out of my account yesterday. is there a chance they may just refund my USD since the price has shot up so much? even though the price was locked in and they already took the money out of my bank?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:13:36
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:29:03
i'm so stupid..
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:09:16
More like quintupled. I bought my first whole coin in the beginning of November for $250 and watched the price climb to nearly $1250
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:52:26
ah i've been in love with the NSX since high school. good for you man! when the price doubles my original investment, i plan on cashing the price i paid and sitting on the rest "to the moon" too. lol here's to bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:03:48
i have 2 bitcoins. stash it away for a couple years and you're covered. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:46:32
you haven't been watching the prices. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:23:35
"Oh no! Another crash!"
Because remember how much the price shot up after all the "India is crazy for bitcoin" posts?
Yeah, neither do I. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:38:13
Even so, if only one person inspects the work and notices an attack and drops out, the total mining power drops, and with how quick word spreads on the internet, others in the pool would become aware rather quickly, no?
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:45:00
awesome watch! thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:20:11
how did you get "this time is different" out of his comment? after every "bubble" since bitcoin's inception, it has come back to set new all time highs after the "crash." he wasn't saying "this time is different." he was saying "this time is just like all the other times." bitcoin will rise again. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:03:05
i work in a college town at a large liquor and wine store. the other day i was talkin bitcoin with a coworker and a man comes up to the counter and overheard us. come to find out he's an economics professor at our college. he said he had heard quite a bit about BTC. he said he had a couple of his students who bought in early and now were now "rich" from it. they know about it. it's just kind of a "taboo" subject for them.. for now. :P
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:01:27
nice design
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:40:04
the one in the middle really looks like a twat. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:45:35
big investors will invest big regardless. this would help bring the small too. not everyone is necessarily interested in bitcoin as an investment. some may be fascinated by the technology and just want to "play" with a little. either way, more "small" bitcoin buyers are overall better for coinbase and bitcoin alike. 
edit: typo
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:24:54
awesome video. the ONLY thing i kept waiting for that i didn't get to see in it was some interview when someone (i don't remember who) said "the only way to shut it down is to shut down the internet." that at the end would've been perfect.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:19:34
I have had nothing but smooth transactions and good things to say about coinbase.

hustlin. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:50:52
Hopefully this gets pulled off and theres a decent bitcoin wallet in cydia. i upgraded to ios7 before i was really into bitcoin and now im seriously considering switching to android just so i can have a btc wallet on my phone. a jailbreak would solve this.
