I love how only 'experienced insiders knew about the fork'. What the fuck. This shit was LITERALLY all over the news sites and subreddits.

I can be BagMan. My superpower is the ability to retardedly hold shitcoins down to - 99%, and then buy Bitcoin high and selling it low.

God damn it I fucking hate Pomp. He tweets dumb shit like this every day. And dumb redditors post his dumb tweets everyday.

Smh I blew it on Satoshimines. What were we thinking.

This is totally doable. I remember a few years back, when phpBB forums were the bomb, I'd sign up an user and basically reply to my own threads from it. That's was to make sure whoever arrived didn't think I was the only one, to give it a bit of legitimacy. Maybe Hal did the same :)

I blew a lot on Satoshimines. What the fuck was I thinking.

I'd pay actual precious bitcoin for this addition on the game.

He will always be Satoshi in my heart :(

Ratoshi has done more for Bitcoin than Faketoshi.

And putting visa in the middle of the transaction, just as they wanted.

Libra is already on the Uncle Sam's sniper shooting range. It might not even go live.

Exactly. Who gives a shit about them? We want adoption from everyday people, not Wall Street financial wolves.

Isn't this bank partially owned by Nimiq (crypto startup) and Litecoin? Lol

Well a few months back a bitcoin dev discovered a critical vulnerability that allowed printing bitcoin at will. Code will always be exploitable man.

Satoshi was ahead of his time.

I have posted this every time I see a tweet from Pomp on reddit.
Goddammit I fucking hate pomp.

BITCOIN DID 9/11
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:43:14
Exactly. I'll always believe Finney was Satoshi. RIP.

They bought 0 graphic cards. They use Antminers.

Those are, in average, the highest volume exchanges that trade BTC/USD (not USDT) 
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:28:01
High quality meme. Give some updates to this man! 
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:20:06
Hal Finney, who many think is Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:29:02


And without wall street bonuses, chinese new year, consensus pamp and Sminem killing the Bogdabots!

And that book is average at best, yet people praise it as a must for personal finance -_-
