Is there any talk of making SegWit transactions default on Bitcoin Core? I've read that it was going to be part of a certain update, but it didn't. Is there another ETA or something?

While you're probably asking about this short gift, I must mention that the clip is from [Batmetal](

Cry*. Because you didn't buy one year ago.

So just to be clear, those numbers are probably fake. You can check all the info [in this link]( if you sort by volume. 
The funny thing is: AFAIK both NegocieCoins and TemBTC are owned by the same corporation. 
The difference of volume between the second place and the third place is immense. It makes no sense.
Sadly I can't bring much more information to the table since I'm pretty out of the loop regarding the Brazilian Bitcoin scene. But those numbers are ~~definitely~~ *probably* fake. At this point it became pretty much a meme.

The monetary revolution didn't happen in **most** countries. 
We already have countries like Venezuela, or Argentina that people are buying Bitcoin at a 20~40% premium.
The revolution will happen when it needs to happen. Out of necessity. When everything else breaks.

I laughed at your post but then it occurred to me you could mean it

Just curious about something. I'm using Electrum, and on the PC version there is a "Console" tab with some stuf on it.
Basically it says "Welcome to my node, I'm a Bitcoin Core supporter :)", and some other stuff, and a wallet donation address. 
What is this? Whose node? Why? I thought it could be the donation for Electrum devs or something, but said adress has only ever received ~0.013 bitcoins.

Why? D:

Damn. I already have some on my Electrum. I guess I'll send everything to it.

wait oh god what's happening
I didn't quite understand what's going on, but I have enough on my Mycelium wallet to be worried
