Think about it this way, if you left a baby alone in a stroller in grand central station for an hour, whether or not the baby came into harm it would still be a victim of reckless endangerment because you left the baby there, willfully putting it into a situation where it could come into harm, so whether or not the baby actually does come into harm, it is still a victim of your reckless disregard for the babies life.
But let's say you were doing drugs, as long as you are alone and only hurting yourself, there is no victim. What the legal system does today is assume that doing drugs is automatically equal to doing something violent towards someone else.

You cant just make things illegal to protect people from them, ever heard of prohibition, that didn't go so well.
The hard truth is, people are stupid, and they will do stupid things, they will do drugs and hurt themselves and in generally suck as people. But it is not the jobs of governments to protect people from themselves. Spending a gross amount of government money on a "war on drugs" doesn't help people, it [hurts society in general](
You can't make suicide illegal, or self-harm, but you can help those people through programs and mental support. Im not saying we should make heroin legal, but we shouldn't throw people in jail for using it when they only hurt themselves.

Well actually you are totally right, I said that if you are alone, with no one under your care, there is no victim, but if there is a child that relies on you it is the victim.
In my original comment I said it's a only victimless if your the only one who relies on you while you do drugs.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:10:05
Well yes, but that's not the crime.  The crime isn't what you're doing, its essentially that what you are doing is putting the child at risk. So the video games aren't the crime, the endangerment of the child (lets say forgetting to feed the child) is the crime, it is just caused by whatever you are doing.
Under today's laws if you spent all your time trying to solve a rubix cube while letting an infant starve you wouldn't be charged with illegal rubix cube solving, you would be charged with reckless endangerment or disregard for human life.

I think it would be great if we could all work together to decide which causes in bitcoin were good and important to its future and then invest in those causes.
We could help build notoriety for it and help fund projects important to its success.
Plus that cute little wizard ad is what got me to check this sub out in the first place.

But I'm not trying to say there's no victim there, I'm saying there's only no victim if you are alone.

But during that time the baby is under your care and therefore as long as the harm that comes to the baby while you were ACTIVELY taking care of it is not your fault unless you willfully caused the harm. But by leaving the baby unattended, a baby that was meant to be under your care, you are by proxy assuming responsibility for what happens to it because you left it alone, if you still had e baby with you then you probably did what you could to save it if harm occurred.
My point is that harm need not come to the baby for it to have been victimized. If you throw a baby off a cliff, it doesn't matter if it survives because to you still committed a crime by putting it in harms way (willfully mind you). Something that is important to remember is that there are two scenarios in the baby example. One where the baby comes into harm [Depraved-Heart murder]( and one where it doesn't come into harm, but could have, which is [Reckless endangerment](

Wait what, entertaining and enlightening?
By calling him a prepubescent kid?
I in no way understand how making petty insults against a person (I still do think he's irresponsible with the bitcoin he's been given) makes you entertaining or enlightening
He is not a prepubescent kid (to the best of my knowledge) and while he has shown he is untrustworthy he has not stolen the funds (or at least not spent them for him own purposes) and deserves at least some shred of respect, and least insofar as to not call him a child.

I understand that, but if you wish to make an informed point it is important to use logic and not exploit fallacies like such.


First off I want to clarify that I am not talking specifically about the US government or any real-world government, there is as of yet no perfect government.
So are you asking me to explain why the concept of a government is moral or why the US government specifically is moral? I don't agree with the sentiment that the US government is necessarily moral but I do support the idea of the US gov being *not*-immoral.
The concept of a voluntary government which derives its power from the consent of those it governs controlling an area of land and the *consenting* people within it is moral. Those people either pay taxes, pool resources w/ the government, or work for the entity of the gov which then provide benefits in the vein of aid for poor or disadvantaged, medical care, food, housing/shelter, protection from foreign entities and domestic aggressors, enforce laws governing conduct determined by the wishes of the people, and many other things. 
Laws are an agreed upon set of things that, if done, will evoke consequences enforced by the government. I'm not saying that anti-drug laws are moral, or that the US governments unwillingness to stop restricting them despite public demand is moral. But I want to make the point that these laws are made by the people in the best interests for their own prosperity.


The reason for this in the US and other sovereign nations is the idea that selling your body is not good for anyone and especially for people in general. I'm not saying its entirely correct but these kinds of things lead to a worse off culture and especially worse off sex workers.


Not really true, in the US if you run from a low/medium/or even high security facility they will try and find you, but they are not out to kill you , if you resist arrest and pose a serious threat to the people chasing you they will shoot you , but not just because.
Plus none of these things are true for the concept of government, just specific government.
Honestly I think you just don't like the US government, not government in general.
If/when you respond please treat me with the respect I have shown for you.

this is actually an example of public endangerment, a subset of reckless endangerment: 
The victim is anyone who might have come to harm by your willful disregard for human life.

Straw man argument:
Setting up a weak version of the opponent's position which can be easily refuted
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:58:22
I was just agreeing with you but then...


Please, this is a big problem with the internet in general, don't resort to petty and in all likelyhood untrue insults, especially when you are on the cusp of a good point
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:06:23
Yes, well it still is, reckless endangerment. As a drunk driver you endanger other drivers. The crime is endangering your fellow man through reckless, unsafe behavior.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:27:49
Endangering someone does a actually make them a victim of reckless disregard for human life.

If the Gov changes its mind and shuts it down those bitcoins your hiding under your bed arent worth shit
