It's clearly an excuse to get out without people bitching at him, just like "transaction malleability" was. It's a lot harder for people like to him to come out and say "I spent all your money on advertising but never actually developed anything, I am grossly incompetent, I lost all your money". No, he's going to say that internet strangers threatened his family, and everyone is going to "feel bad" for him and not really question it.

"Everyone's talking about it, so it's gotta go somewhere!"

Oh, alright, fair enough. Being part of the "bitcoin community" you learn not to take anything at face value and just assume everyone is lying unless proven otherwise.

He's waiting until people forget about it so he can cash out. It's fucking obvious and there's really no defense for it. There is no need for any custom forum software, it's just a lie to keep the money tied up until people forget. You would think he would be more humble with donations from users, but no, he doesn't have the *time* to keep repeating it to you, silly peasant. Of course he doesn't have the *time* to improve the forum either, since it's already been a couple of years!
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:25:02
Lots of advertising, expensive office building, hiring a ton of staff before they actually had anything working or any customers. He has no idea how to run a business.

If you were verified on Mt. Gox, you're in for a bad time. Most likely your ID (driver license, passport, SSN documents, etc.) have been compromised, along with your password and bank information (which in the US is usually enough to request a wire), and is up to the highest bidder.

Lots of places in Japan don't even accept credit cards. It's still very much a cash based society, and international cards like VISA and etc. are only accepted at airports and 7-Elevens. This is more circlejerking.

It makes perfect sense. What don't you understand? He's lying through his teeth. He knew what was about to happen, bailed, didn't pay anyone, made up a bullshit excuse to leave the country, and is now sitting somewhere in the UK laughing.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:41:29
They would be stupid not to. Hackers are after one thing most of the time, money... they told you they won't touch users so they can appear "noble" and we can all feel reassured, but you can be sure they will sell those IDs. Credit cards are sold in bulk for $1-3 a piece, imagine how much they could get for hundreds of thousands of passports/driver licenses?

Oh no, on the contrary, he's very smart. He knew how to play people and leverage his position to get 6 million from naive people that really thought they were donating to the "community".

No, but if they hire you, they will check your SS, address, and generally have legal cause to find you and arrest you if you pull something like that, and it will be much easier than explaining "some developer online stole my Bitcoins" to the police, they will just say "this person violated our employment agreement".

You won't be able to dump anything. They will clear the orderbooks before opening trading, if they ever even reopen, and no one in their right mind will put in buy orders. Your shares (and mine) are now worthless.

@_date: 2013-06-29 15:02:16
Yeah, and bitcoin has fallen to $96. All the people that think the jump from 2.5 to 3.5 was simply because "ASICMiner is a super awesome investment" fail to see that Bitcoin has fallen from 135 to 95 in the exact same time period.

You're an idiot. The point of SR was to give you freedom to choose - if you chose meth, that's your own fault, but he didn't want the government, nor anybody else, even himself, dictating what you can and can't buy. Freedom is all or nothing, it's not "you can have weed and physchedelics because AllanChezar thinks they are ok, but everything else is harmful for you!"
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:14:53
yes he fucking said that he understands this, stop being clueless bitcoin fanatics. he's saying even if it's better, it's not going to take off without a killer use for it, kinda like paypal would have never taken off without being required for ebay in the first place, because ordinary people don't give a shit about "the state of money transfer" as long as they can buy their shit on amazon or ebay with their CC

Guess what, I do live in the US, almost half our budget (and thus my taxes) goes to killing brown people, education gets something like 1% and universities are some of the most expensive in the world, no free medical care, shit public transport in almost every major city, horrendous infrastructure (local roads are shit, power goes out in the event of a little rain because most major powerlines in the US are above ground, they find sex hormones and lead in the tap water periodically), yet my govt. loves policing the world with my money. For someone that talks about seeing perspectives, I wish you could see mine.
Edit: if I lived in one of those European socialist havens ala Denmark and payed extremely high taxes for a good reason, then maybe I would agree with you. But until then 'paying your taxes which is a social duty' sounds like something from a government pamphlet.

The constitution always prohibited more than 2 *consecutive* terms, nothing was ever said about limiting the *total* terms of an individual. The change in 2008 only extended the presidential term from 4 to 6 years. So what Putin is doing is legal and was always legal since 1993, according to what is "written down in constitution".

It might be hard to tie him to running the Silkroad and he might become a 'martyr', especially if he says he was just trying to provide freedom.

Because after you buy a t-shirt to support your favorite site/tracker/whatever and buy your drugs from SR, what is a DAILY purchase that Bitcoin is USEFUL for, besides vanity or luxury expenditures (on shit like TREZOR or bitcoin mining stuff)? The answer is nothing, nothing makes 1 BTC worth $100 besides all the early speculation and early tech-minded adopters, now that they are all selling or holding their coins, there is very little reason to buy Bitcoins and very little people that do so. Bitcoin is not USED for anything, and it's value will continue to slowly decline unless something magical happens, for example Ebay makes it required for all purchases (without which Paypal would have never taken off).

Good for you, but I'm pretty sure the exchange rate matters a lot to the market, the majority of which is made up of practical people looking for a return, not bitcoin idealists. Before you start preaching to me about how I'm not worthy of ASICMiner stock, I have $21K (from an initial $10k) invested across the 3 exchanges, but my head isn't stuck up my ass, and yet blind believers like you, who cannot see that Bitcoin is still in its infancy and very much dependent on USD, keep telling me that "I just don't understand".

No you're wrong. I'm holding my bitcoins until I die. In fact I'm going to buy more since they're so cheap now. This is all just market manipulation. Bitcoin is super awesome and will survive. This is not the result of speculation, this was all expected, it's just readjusting. The fundamentals of bitcoin are sound. This is a revolution!
