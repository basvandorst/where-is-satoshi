I was probably about 15 and I decided to culture myself by going through IMDb's top 100 list and watch as many movies as I could. Se7en was on there. I remember watching it on a dark rainy school day, in my parents basement, alone.

I think people are downvoting you because they don't realize you were making an analogy the whole time. :\ You and PoorlyTimedSaxophone are in agreement here.
The only difference is who is paying the product company fiat. OP is paying directly, after using Coinbase to get Fiat, whereas Gyft pays Amazon fiat for the Gift card which you exchange for Fiat credit at Amazon. There's no meaningful difference.

Without going into numbers, their hashrate share of the network was consistently higher than previous weeks -- ~0.003 BTC/share increase right there. They also reduced the minimum USB miner order quantity from 300 to 50 which would likely increase sales volume. I imagined that would at least sustain their hardware revenue and likely give it a modest boost.
