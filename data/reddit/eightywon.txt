[this]( and googling as needed should get you there. Installation of the software isn't actually too bad.

Participating in the network as a node and therefore helping in the routing of transactions will allow you to earn small per transaction fees, but no one knows for sure yet how the economics of it all will look in a live environment.

It's not easy currently. c-lightning implementation, took me about a full day to spin up the bitcoin full node (without having to download the blockchain which I copied from my main node) and lightning node on an RPi, and that was the smooth part. I've got a moderate amount of Linux experience.
Since then, it's been an exercise in frustration opening and using channels. I funded with 500,000sat and was eventually able to buy a sticker from the Blockstream store, but have been fighting bugs, channel, and route issues since the beginning. I initially wanted to buy the t-shirt, too, but bugs have prevented me from being able to do that.
I've not *directly* lost any BTC due to bugs, however I have "lost" BTC to the fees associated with having to close and open new channels due to bugs.
From my last few days of experiences with it, I'd say we're still easily 6-12 months away from even an early-adopter phase (note: I haven't messed with any of the other implementations except Eclair Mobile on testnet). There are a number of issues that never even occurred to me before the last few days testing, too, that go to the core of the implementation. edit: They'll be solved either by LN or it's eventual replacement technology, but now we're talking long term.
My impression is that LN is going to be a suitable but imperfect stepping stone to something even better.
Overall a rewarding experience, though. 10/10 would bang.

While I agree with this, there are some very basic bugs and implementation issues with the software right now that need to be worked out before we can even begin to worry about testing at scale/scale related issues. Those bugs/issues should absolutely be tested and caught on testnet.
All the mainnet stuff is going on right now (including the node I'm running) is for fun and hype (which is great)

Your node can only route transactions for which it has enough BTC to cover (on a channel basis).
Alice wants to pay Bob 10BTC. The best route the payment can take goes through you. From the network's perspective, Alice settles with you for 10BTC and you settle with Bob for 10BTC, taking a small fee as part of the process.

I'd think the zero would run the lightning network software easily. Bitcoin full node is going to be the limiting factor, with available ram likely being the biggest issue.
Compare the zero's available ram vs. what's required by bitcoind (or whatever node you want  to run).
You'll also obviously need an external drive to house the blockchain (~160GB all told currently).
edit: GB, not Gb

I'm hyped about it so I guess.... no?
I mean, we're currently at the point in LN development where developers are literally engineering (in code) how to implement the protocol. I'm not sure what gave you the expectation that mobile wallets should be widely available yet? Those are going to come much later in the process.
I suppose it's possible to have misread the hype if you're only paying attention to reddit post titles, but cursory research shows we're clearly not at the point you seem to assume we are.
Why so sad? We'll get there.

Nevermind, seems straight forward -  - prolly can be done with core too.

There are a few different groups actively developing node software, and they're all on github. You can check open and past bugs on their respective projects. For instance, c-lightning implementation -
 
Development is VERY active. They're pushing out bug fixes every day. "Update/modify" the network is like how you'd update the bitcoin network. You release a new client and it's up to the community when they choose to install it.

I want to move my cold wallet to a segwit enabled address but I haven't found a known secure segwit paper wallet generator yet. Course I only researched for 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:35:16
Yeah, I've been running one the last few days. Basically install bitcoind, download (or copy) the blockchain, install your lightning implementation.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:20:37
Yes, node versions will generally be backward compatible as they're written per the lightning network protocol/standards. Changes are in terms of how the various node flavors implement the protocol programmatically. In terms of development methodology, it's very similar to how bitcoin node software evolves.

It wouldn't surprise me if it did. The LCD is one of the Chinese knock-offs, but the advantage is that IIRC it was \~$15.
We'll see.

Got tired of using my phone, having the screen timeout and having to log back in, and I prefer to use my browser/screen real estate for other things. I had a spare Pi and cheap LCD sitting around, so threw this together to be a permanent ticker screen.

I like the analogy of the savings (your HODL btc, wherever you choose to store it) and the checking/spending cash (your LN balance).
You only expose to centralization risk (your LN balance) what you'd risk carrying in your wallet in the old fiat world - enough to cover your day to day transactions, petty cash.

So after watching this video I decided to try LN out. Here's what I did, from a practical perspective:
* Installed the "Eclair Wallet Testnet" app from the Google Play store on my andriod phone
*  Opened the app, grabbed my new testnet wallet's btc address, and entered it into [this faucet]( then clicked "Give me some coins"
* Back in the app, once the testnet coins arrived (quick), I swiped left until I was on the *LIGHTNING CHANNELS* tab, I clicked the plus/add button at the bottom and chose *PASTE A NODE URI*
* I added the 02f1da524a70afd8de6019e2367b47d8d41a623aa3594f55d0785fe1b047c853bc node from [this thread]( Knowing what node to add was a bit confusing, but this worked to purchase coffee from starblocks. I entered 160mBTC for the channel capacity
* I waited 5-10 minutes for the Eclair app to show that my new payment channel had the required 2 confirmations
* I opened [starblocks]( in the browser on my PC and placed my order
* I swiped to the *TRANSACTION HISTORY* tab in the Eclair app on my phone and pressed the icon in the bottom right to *SCAN A PAYMENT*
* I scanned the QR code presented by starblocks, and bought my mother fucking coffee
* I got as giddy as I did the first time I used bitcoin
* I ran upstairs to show my wife and she told me to go away

This. That whole conversation was frustrating as shit to read because the were both talking past each other. If someone would have just said what you just said, the issue would have been so much more clear.

If you believe in the eventual success of the technology, buy what you can, when you can, and ignore the price as much as you can. Be sure you and only you control the keys and store them securely. 
It's truly that simple.

GDAX/coinbase. No fee for ACH deposits/withdrawals or to transfer in btc. No trading fees for limit orders.

Exactly what you'd expect Adam Back to say. 
He's also brilliant and exactly right. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:59:40
I xfered to a cold wallet from GDAX a week ago and observed no fee. Not sure why

Yes. I believe the bitcoin timestamp would reliably be UTC but the tweet date/time would depend on the timezone settings of the twitter account of the person who took the screenshot.
Seems pretty clear, though, that the btc transaction was at least several hours AFTER the tweet.
