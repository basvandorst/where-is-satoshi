I didn't realize debit transfers were the same thing as wire transfers. Bitcoin does have other advantages though. Also I'm not sure if debit transfers are reversible.

D-Wave has proven that their quantum computers are as fast as supercomputers at certain problems. That's proof enough for me.
You don't know for a fact that one time pads wouldn't be usable. A bank could distribute USB keys with pad processing software to make payments from. You don't have to carry 5GB of pad data to send 5GB of information for example, you could just use an irrational number system.

I agree. I might create something like this in conjunction with something else. I had this idea about a month ago.

I would imagine it wouldn't be built to break bitcoin, but to prove that quantum computing can break SHA and public/private key encryption. That kind of power would be pretty valuable to investors. After that, it would only take a government effort to use it for military purposes and seizing funds from bitcoin accounts.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:16:03
I can't do that, but I'll explain what I know it means.
bit-card keeps a private key associated with the multisignature address, the customer gets the other one.
bit-card signs the private key and address pair and puts it on the card to verify that bit-card owns the private key associated with the funds.
The customer has the other private key to ensure bit-pay can't spend their funds, and bit-pay signs it to ensure it's the private key associated with the address.
Unfortunately I don't think this it's possible for bitpay to sign your private key without knowing it, so unless that can be resolved the cards are a bad idea.

No, the entire banking system will not simply "go down".
People who hold bitcoins just like to say that to downplay the significance QC has on Bitcoin. Encrypted communications can still take place in a quantum world, and fiat would continue running perfectly fine. The only thing that would be hindered is remote internet access to banking systems, and even that can be easily remedied using one-time-pad encryption.
On the other hand, Bitcoin would crumble in one fell swoop, with absolutely no recourse to get any of your money back.
And no, every computer system in the world would still be perfectly secure. The only thing that would be made insecure is communications. There is a huge difference.
@_date: 2013-07-21 18:12:58
There is actually a standard being developed by the owner of Casascius that would allow instant transactions with Bitcoin without changing the protocol. Basically miners who opt in would be paid to broadcast proof of work to the network before it's added to the blockchain, which proves that miners are working to confirm the transaction. If 51% of the hashing power is dedicated to the transaction, then it's safe to accept it with 0 confirmations, assuming the miners go on to add it to the chain, which is incentivized by adding a payment.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:49:34
Namecoin is being developed for this
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:41:03
You're assuming that bitcoin isn't going to be worth much when quantum computing comes around.
And my point still stands, I'd rather not have all of my money in bitcoin if that did happen; it would be much better to hold gold or other valuables in that case.
@_date: 2013-05-22 10:35:09
Meanwhile, you don't do anything with them. Meanwhile you need to get people's DNS servers integrated with Namecoin. OpenDNS could be one step. The next step could be Google's DNS servers, etc.
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:19:46
Well, it might. Encryption isn't invulnerable to attack.
@_date: 2013-05-17 04:37:23
You don't need a modified client, you just need to use the raw transaction API. I've done this before with bitcoind.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:19:02


Yeah, that's the point. You could access any wallet you wanted with that kind of power. It wouldn't just increase the hashing rate.
And yeah, it would be pretty devastating, but if that were feasible, all of your bitcoins would become worthless if the technology was used maliciously. I'd rather not be holding something whose value depends entirely on encryption if that did happen.
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:03:33

@_date: 2013-05-20 10:59:59
For anything unimportant like logging in to reddit, we can wait for quantum encryption. The majority of people won't have quantum computers in the meantime, so only governments will be able to crack those communications. Important stuff like financial transactions can still utilize one time pads.
@_date: 2013-08-10 03:41:53

Actually no, with bitcoin you need businesses to accept it to do anything useful with it. It's pretty much the same thing. The tipping point is just more fuzzy.
ICANN doesn't have to support namecoin. You just need to use a DNS server that supports Namecoin resolution. Browsers also don't have any role in this, although browser adoption would help.

I don't know exactly how the process works, but you're right, unless there is a change in the protocol that adds these partial confirmations to the chain while the confirmations are being created. Whether or not that's what he had in mind, I don't know, but it would be a good idea.

I forking heard you the first time
@_date: 2013-05-22 09:22:27
I'm sure that at some point, the current domain name system wasn't supported out of the box by networking hardware. The reason people are buying into Namecoin is because they're speculating that it will make progress in that direction, not because of its current usefulness.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:41:38
You only have to wait 2 weeks.
One way to do it would be to add all of your hardware at the beginning of a difficulty cycle, mine up a shitload of bitcoins, then when the difficulty readjusts, short sell the bitcoins and attack the network. It would have an added benefit of slowing down block creation when the attack is done.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:21:23
Miners don't have to be complicit in a double spend attempt if you don't require a confirmation.
In that case, all the buyer has to do is send multiple transactions with the same coins to different addresses to perform a double spend. That's why you must wait for a confirmation. Requiring multiple blocks decreases the chance of each spend being included in a different fork if two nodes generate the next block simultaneously.

That doesn't convince me quantum computers wouldn't be able to crack it. We're talking about the ability of quantum computers to crack it, not the availability of algorithms.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:00:18
I know it's not based on PGP. ECDSA is the algorithm I was referring to in this case. It's based on the same principles.

The more the network grows, the more incentive a government might have to attack the network. It's actually a good thing since incentive to attack the network only grows as the network becomes more resilient.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:16:49
That sounds about right. Transaction fees vary based on transaction size, so if you send a 499 kilobyte transaction, you will have to pay a lot more than 0.01 BTC, and there would be no guarantee that a transaction that size would be included in a block.
@_date: 2013-05-20 05:33:57
It's not the least of your concerns if you hold a significant amount of money in it.
@_date: 2013-05-22 00:02:03
Keys would be equations that generate irrational numbers, which are used as the pad.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:33:07
You're wrong.
All you have to do is send the transactions simultaneously to different nodes and conflicting transactions get propagated through the network.

No, they're not as easy as asymmetric encryption but it's still doable.
In other words, the financial system won't collapse due to asymmetric encryption being broken. All you would need is for your payment processor to give you a list of keys to use with transactions that you would use to encrypt and decrypt communications using software.
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:43:18
Give bitcoins pls
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:50:59
I don't see anything on that list that would cause a problem if notifications are opt-in and partial blocks only exist in memory and not on disk. I'm not referring to decreasing block time.
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:23:58
@_date: 2013-07-19 20:59:20
Apparently this is caused by sending a zero output with the transaction. That may make it take awhile to confirm it, but it gets confirmed. If it's not confirmed, you may be able to send a different transaction to get the coins back, but I'm not positive.

Fractional reserve banking can still be done with bitcoin. That's not really a problem. The problem is fractional lending, which is creating money out of thin air, with the intention of paying it back. That creates inflation.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:30:12
Not if quantum computing renders conventional security completely obsolete. If you needed quantum hardware to defend against quantum computing, we wouldn't be able to upgrade the system until the technology became widespread. That would leave bitcoin open to attack for a significant amount of time.

Bitcoin needs to handle transaction fees in terms of kilobyte size. The minimum payment should scale according to how much data you add to the chain.
This way you could still make micropayments, but the more you make, the more of a fee you have to pay.

@_date: 2013-07-19 04:02:57
Connect to a lot of nodes, when you get a transaction wait a couple seconds and listen for double spends. If you don't get any double spends, consider the funds confirmed. You can use libbitcoin to make a custom listener. Also make sure the transaction has a minimum fee.
@_date: 2013-05-22 09:20:01

Quantum computers can check every solution to a problem within the bit space provided by its hardware if I'm not mistaken. Every bit doubles its capacity, and the bit growth rate is on an exponential trend, doubling something like every year for D-Wave's systems. If it can't crack SHA, it can still crack PGP, one of the technologies bitcoin is based on. Although I would bet SHA would at least be weakened by quantum hardware.
