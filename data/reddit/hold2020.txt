You are not a holder. See those people who bought years ago and never sold no matter how tempting? Those are holders. I got in very late but now got a good portfolio of some bitcoin and different altcoins where I see good projects/products, benefit for the people, possibility for the future. And I probably should just cut off internet and not even watch them anymore til in a few years :)

apple better watch out or some holder just buys them with btc

Well the advantage for Bitcoin is still its the  most popular, everyone going into Bitcoin. While BCash not having any trust. Also there is 100s of other Altcoins that also have fast transactions like BCash. So I dont really see how BCash could grow really big just because of that. It would take a little more.
  
I agree its pretty bad for Bitcoin tho, hopefully it wont be too long now for faster, much cheaper transactions to happen so its more usable in the poorer places.

it just means its submitted. coinbase cant look in your bank account luckily

You paid just a bit over 100 Sat per byte, this would probably take 3-4 days because the market is so busy right now. But everything over 80 Sat should confirm. For the transaction to return, that would take like 2 weeks. In any case it wont get lost.

Interesting info, I also just read an article that said people were even paying 20% more in Korea just to get Bitcoin now. However I dont come to the same conclusion as you... I dont see why price could not increase further. If the people dont even believe the medias talk of a bubble, they will just keep holding, and buy more.
