Absolutely true... You don't live in the US do you?

It works really well in Venezuela as well.

You aren't "down" money unless you sell. Ever heard of BTFD?

It all comes down to the ability of a government to devalue the currency without a gold standard. On a gold standard, they cannot fire up the presses unless they have underlying backing for doing so. Without the gold standard, a government can literally just steal from everyone unilaterally by printing additional currency. Each dollar printed steals a fraction of the buying power of the already issued currency. For a good basis, I would suggest reading the works of FA Hayek (start with The Road to Serfdom) and Ron Paul's End the Fed!

I think you are missing that not all ETFs are derivative instruments. While some are (leveraged, inverse, etc.), some are simply just tied to an assets price. As has been stated, an ETF could be helped in tax deferred accounts (IRA, 401k, etc) while physical bitcoin cannot. I am a goldbug, but not entirely sure your comparison with the physical gold market to the BTC market is apt. Physical gold does not have near the transparency inherent in BTC, and as a result, can more easily be manipulated. It had long been rumored that COMEX and NYMEX vaults held less gold than they had written on, but no one could ever prove it.

If a regular person is investing in something, they should understand what they are investing in. If not, as they say, "a fool and his money are soon parted." 
I think SEC Commissioner Peirce puts it best in her dissent, which you can read here: [ I highly recommend her speeches which she has given since then as well.

All ETFs are not the same. Some are derivative (inverse, leveraged) and some are strictly tied to the value of the asset which backs the ETF.
