More like, probably had no idea that he'd be charged. I don't expect to pay for parking to visit places like that. Also, I had to drive 90 minutes to where I picked up my marriage license--it would not have convent to realize at the end that I needed to find my bank at the end of such a trip.

Wrong table. If they did not have it and you ask them if they have it, then they have it, and could sell it.

One problem other I see: A million dollar ransom is 2% of the current Bitcoin economy--it would be probably a little illiquid, even if the issue of redeeming was resolved. 
On the other hand, I don't have any idea what a typical ransom is in real life. Googling 'Typical ransom' didn't do anything other than get me on an FBI watchlist.

People might... But if you can write a script to play satoshidice, you can write a script to simulate it. And if you can do THAT, you'll know that you'll ALWAYS lose money in the long run. (Really!)
That said... I've played satoshidice a few times, it is kinda fun/addicting/really perfectly designed for bitcoin. But playing isn't anything but giving money to the owners.
