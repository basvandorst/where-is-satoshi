I’m not sure what your talking about now you’ve clearly gone of on a tangent to nowhere.
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:03:19
I’ve done some research it seems that it’s not necessarily the private key that’s the main security it’s a high hash rate network that’s the real security.
I understand that in BTCs early years cryptographic private keys could be found easily with a lap top computer to release the Block reward of Bitcoins, it seems the algorithm adjusts this mining difficulty over time meaning you need more computing power to release the reward  OR find the hash the cryptographic key or get very close to this unique number as possible to release the mining reward.
So in effect miners are actually hacking private keys through a process of mining bitcoin transactions.
So the keys are less difficult to guess with less computing power on the network of which ever Blockchain it is running on, logically more hash makes it harder less hash makes it easier.
Am I correct in this?.

Can’t see the point myself over using a debit card, but if that’s your thing then they’ll take your money just the same.
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:29:11
Just because you’ve gambled and not lost doesn’t mean you can’t or won’t.
People get paid in fiat for a reason it’s reasonably stable, Bitcoins so called profits held in bitcoin can be wiped out in an instant that’s why it’s not money in the true sense of the word, the general population won’t be coaxed into that for the simple reason it’s gambling.
When you consider online gambling sites people who play always say they win in reality many lose So do many so called traders.

If you could read also and went through the links I’d provided you’d see that ETHEREUM CLASSIC was attack in the way I’ve said when it’s price was down meaning less profitable so miners had less hash-rate the chart in the link is a dead giveaway.
Off course if Bitcoins price followed the same path of shedding value each day it also becomes more vulnerable to attack.
I hope you’re getting it now.

A distributed network of many miners doesn’t add security it adds decentralisation, decentralisation means no central server to shut down that has Little to nothing to do with security.
Go back and read LOW HASH LOW SECURITY.
My my my you’ve some  learning to do.
Miners don’t have to conspire, you only need a company, country,  or individual with more hash power to effectively create a double spend by re-writing the ledger that’s what they did with Eutherium classic and if you’d read that we’d not be here now.
Miners generally don’t agree to attack their own networks rogue entities do that.
Read the end of first paragraph SECURITY.
Then read decentralised consensus 
I’ve only known about Bitcoins for 4 days it says you’ve been on here for 3 years are you slow.
@_date: 2019-10-21 11:03:29
Off topic you mean you don’t really believe in censorship resistance then well well well how ironic is that, you want Bitcoins to be resistant but you don’t believe in free speech is that right?

@_date: 2019-10-21 05:38:28
So what are you reading into this, are you saying this is showing adoption or are you saying there are more transaction than usual?.
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:30:13
Let me show you anyway so you can see how dumb Bitcoin is and many who invest in it calling it sound money and bullshit like that.
Firstly Bitcoins value in real time is probably a few hundred dollars based on the electric it wastes.
Dumb sucker retail investors come next, the markets tiny so they can probably raise the price up to say 2k max.
Then there is USDT the pumper of pumps, go look at every price spike in Bitcoin there is no real value at all it is all TETHER minting ��.
Traders and whales know those printing times and react as you or I would cashing out into USDT and making a mint, then buying back in when the price collapses back.
Remember what I taught you about any money cashed out comes from suckers who are just buying in, well now you should see it’s a pyramid with virtually no value.
Read and look at the graphs only an idiot would disagree.
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:00:36
Why would anyone?  whats the advantage, I mean get paid in fiat pay tax on your fiat wages  and then buy bitcoins to pay for something you could pay for in cash via a debit card.
Urrrr sounds weird to me a kinda novelty token.
Does that middleman company do those transactions for free or do they charge a fee on each transaction as I can’t see it being free.
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:57:40
I understand that if they can’t make a profit off transactions fees when most of the Bitcoins are mined, electricity, hassle, and obvious profits, they’d be stuck in limbo with no options but to inflate the supply and sell more Bitcoins.
I understand it can be done by adding code to the Blockchain so 21 million isn’t a guaranteed limit anymore, I believe most miners ect would have to vote yes to the changes and in that situation why wouldn’t they as they are a for profit organisation.
I believe people see transactions fees as a certainty going forward but no one knows that at all.
@_date: 2019-10-22 03:18:16
No difficulty adjustment only works fine until a price drops drastic enough to cause a mass shut down of hash rate, meaning that the networks hash rate is so low compared to what it is now, it becomes way easier to attack.
And not a case of if, it’s a case of when will the price collapse.
And like I said mining difficulty isn’t security, it’s just a way of making sure a Blocks mined consistently every 10 mins.
As I said BTC in these circumstances will be hacked just for fun then Blockchains like this will be seen for what they are RELIANT on higher prices because that’s how the pyramid tries to guarantee miners rewards by bringing in more sucker money.
Once demand goes because no ones buying in the respect there are no more takers to convince to buy Bitcoins prices stall, confidence ebbs, prices drop as people sell off, this is the start of a self fore filling cycle by then when prices drop more panic selling starts  until the point as I’ve pointed out there’s no security in the network worth talking about, Bitcoins ridiculously high network fees are all over main stream media news yet again as the Blocks can’t cope with this mass exodus and people will be paying hundreds of dollars in fees desperately trying to salvage something anything they can, Blockchains like this can’t scale on chain.
There is little demand for bitcoins at present as its price is stagnant has been for over a year in real adoption terms as most price rises are manipulated not solid demand, so without more sucker money it’s destined to fail sooner rather than later.
Check back to me in a year or two you will see.
Oh and by the way I’ve just put a post on here maybe you’d like to comment there tell your views why and how there is demand for bitcoins I’d be interested to hear you point of view.
Remember the price though.
@_date: 2019-10-21 09:51:31
Not really so you see a gain is a gain and that tax has to be paid same as a loss has to be claimed all hassle for the man in the street.
You can use it because you believe in it, most wont and don’t.
I’m not saying you can’t use it, it’s just that it’s limited because not many are interested and most times you’re not really using bitcoin you are or companies that allow bitcoin payments are transferring straight into fiat for clients (that’s because they may lose if the price drops haha) so no it’s so niche it’s laughable and I assure you in a few years it will be canned and then we’ll be back to one use case a store of value as long as demand is there which it probably won’t be.
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:21:27
As regards the halvening or inflationary mechanism, albeit true prices did spike research shows those price fell back also cancelling out any gains.
The point being they look more impressive than they actually are in reality.
I’m not sure I’m following you on the part about pulling in more demand, I’ve researched the 20k peak when there was high demand yet the price isn’t anywhere near that so how can you say there is more demand as demand increases prices and cuts supply, albeit unsustainable if demand is constant.
Sorry I think you’re maybe believing that halvenings are a guarantee of demand which I don’t see, you can have as many as you like but they don’t guarantee demand.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:16:46
Of course your not going to answer that’s what they all say.
@_date: 2019-10-22 07:23:05
It has first mover advantage in the respect it was what attracted large mining pools, it has less advantages than other crypto coins other than as I said it’s network security and anyone who thinks otherwise is naive because miners work solely for profit not LOVE they go where the profit is like any business If another coin was more profitable and Bitcoin became worthless they’d move over simple as.
Centralisation is what you have to sacrifice when your protocol didn’t work well enough to scale on chain, you can’t have decentralised and centralised as the former isn’t decentralised really is it.
I don’t need to read your link Bitcoin works only by having a price value no one cares if it doesn’t there is no incentive especially for miners, price based pyramid scheme.

You’ve heard this term Genesis Block 
The mysterious satoshi Nakamoto 
Bitcoin will go to 20k,50k,100K,1million this is the Bait.
Everyone who’s cashed out cashed out money invested by people below them people who bought in later.
The people with Bitcoins push for others to adopt so they can pump their monetary value and cash out themselves.
You always need new money if the new money stops coming in the pyramid collapses.
No value is created by Bitcoin ZERO so all the money that’s made can only come from suckers.

@_date: 2019-10-21 19:13:52
It’s not ignorance is it, clearly debit cards are direct and fast without fees, Bitcoins incur short term capital gains tax if applicable or a capital gain loss on purchases so what’s the advantage there then?
So you’re calling me ignorant because I can see the pitfalls of using bitcoins for payments, that’s not ignorant that’s smart.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:39:37
No you are a fucking idiot you don’t pay 2% a year in inflation because people print money so to speak, 2% is the inflation target it’s a mechanism to spur growth and keep the wheels of industry turning.
Stop talking about money printing you moron money that’s printed by the federal reserve bank is money they create without incurring any interest payments on those monies, meaning they cannot go bankrupt unless they declare themselves bankrupt and they won’t they can do all of that because they are the reserve currency if they go down so does everything.
So unless you’ve got some background in economics or a computer science degree or a degree in phycology don’t make out you know what your talking about because you are on par with a goat in the brain stakes.

No political party has been voted in because their policy is to raise taxes, they always lose because people don’t like tax.
What bitcoin proposes since government tax regulation is simply earn your wages and pay tax then buy Bitcoin to pay for everyday things that you may incur tax on (oh and the purchase recording also hassle) you will never get the public to adopt such as stupid system and only die hards think it can still work because they have convinced themselves of this fact.
The people have voted already no one uses it.

I would agree that there must be a lot of power wielded by most bitcoins being held by only a few wallets, on that issue it would be worrying for traditional investors IMO because if a market shock occurred through one reason or another and they decided to sell then the price would probably crash if the wallet spoken of was large enough, maybe this could be a reason those investors may never come into the market.
I can’t say I agree with the cap being increased though as I would consider that to be not good for anyone.
What other reasons would you think a cap could be increased out of interest?.

Nobody said it was the same as Bitcoin but it runs on a Blockchain protected by hash rate the same as any other, you’ve missed the point the structure is the same so no Bitcoin is not without danger from these kinds of attacks if it’s hash rate falls low enough.
You just don’t understand this subject well enough to see it.
Less hash power is available if the price of a Bitcoin falls to $1000 as an example because the miners won’t run hardware that’s not profitable meaning the hash rate drops and security also drops meaning the hash rate is now easier to equal.
Price = Security 
Read on the internet about miners hiring out hash rate it’s all available stuff, that’s why in the matter of a few paragraphs you’ve been shown to have only a low understanding of how Blockchain works.

Completely correct debate the pyramid structure though as many on here are sellers and pumpers.
But it’s not a currency it’s already failed joe public won’t use it as it’s got tax on gain linked to paying with it, sure if the tax was done away with it would work and would be used but that’s how the game they game in their favour Period, it won’t ever be used by the masses.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:29:32
Difficulty adjustment doesn’t work m8 if your networks hash rate falls low enough for a rogue player with more hash power and double spends.
So you’re  one of these idiots on reddit who think now the cats out the bag we can go back to home mining and still have a secure network right, please understand you simply cannot do that.
Just to educate you you can increase hash-rate 20 fold from what it is now yet your network security isn’t 20 fold more secure, the point you miss is the consequences of reducing hash are far more dangerous for once your network is compete-able in hash rate terms by a rouge player they can then create an attack on said network.
And this would happen when your price goes so low the miners walk away and turn off their equipment, price is all in bitcoin.
It’s only computing power nothing more.
What’s funny is in another post of yours you’re saying why do we spent millions of Dollars a day on mining to secure the network, yet here you are arguing the opposite, so you do get what happens when there’s less hash rate or hash rate is equalled or exceeded, pissing myself laughing.
Not doing too bad at lasting on here am I.
But I’ve dug this out for you mining difficulty means higher hash rate harder to mine the Bitcoin reward and arguably more network security.
Lower adjustment level means it’s less hash-rate meaning it’s easier to find the Block reward also less hash-rate leads to lowered network security.
That’s what I’ve been saying but please read up sonny.

You can have security on any coin all it needs is the same hash power bitcoin isn’t unique other than it has that first mover advantage IMO.

Mining fees in theory seem fine only if there is a lot of people using Bitcoins (at current adoption levels I agree these fees wouldn’t sustain miners) but if there was a large move in adoption it is possible they could.
I agree the fees probably will go up in the case there are less takers maybe even making BTC unsustainable.
I couldn’t see anyone trusting Bitcoin if the cap went it becomes no more than another inflated form of money (that’s struggling to act as money because of the tax implications at present IMO).
One thing seems sure people seem patient when prices are low and there is no movement in the market, but I think if BTC ever revisits 20k they’ll be queuing to dump for fiat as I don’t think easy money can be ignored 2nd time around.
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:35:13
Bitcoins slow clunky and volatile, you pay fees with bitcoins transactions and you pay tax on gains, I bet I pay less in bank fees I don’t pay any fees on my debit card.
And I’ve always had access to my money 24/7/365 so nobody considers their money not to be their money it’s just bullshit made up by a bitcoin crowd.

You clearly do need to learn lots all your replies are full of holes in fact you still don’t understand how a Blockchain is secured.
Not sure what you’re talking about with your insinuations about me being here a few weeks ago.
Im not pretending to be knowable at all, all I am doing is correcting your incapacity to see the truth even a retard could understand price drops and miners backing out = a less secure network.

You’ve only partly answered that question yeah sure if the BTC price falls so dramatically that say 90% of miners shut shop you’ve also lost 90% of the security the network once had.
Even if the algorithm adjust the BTC network just became hack able in every sense of the word, it’s preposterous to believe that BTCs mining hash power can go back to levels lower than 10% of what they are now and it survive the bombardment it’s constantly under from rogue players.
As you said it hash rate falls if it falls to low it’s now a hack able network.
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:40:22
They don’t take your Bitcoin they take fiat as the provider will turn the Bitcoin into fiat, MOON will probably sell it on in some way.

Yes debit cards are fast without fees that’s what a real payment rail looks like to me and it works just fine.
I know who pays for fraud ultimately the customer on prices in the shops, I’m happy paying what I pay so is most others as they do it daily 25k transactions a second says it all.
Thanks for seeing the truth and I agree while it’s going through a fiat system anyone using it is basically just showing their support that’s fine but it’s not changing anything because for everyone else the masses it hassle, and it’s dogged with complications even off chain.
My opinion it’s dead has been since it’s scaling problems and regulation, achieving critical mass adoption is a pipe dream Visa Mastercard PayPal have nothing to fear because it just can’t  compete.
@_date: 2019-10-21 05:28:22
Oh it didn’t exist in ETHEREUM CLASSIC you’ve read the link right add into that coinbase admit the hack was external so the only way that hack was possible was a rogue with higher hash rate, what do you think bitcoin miners do when they turn off their hardware sit looking at it or hire it out to mine lesser coins ��, you’ll find it’s the latter as they’re running a business.
So yes a company or a country or an individual who simply amasses more computational power than a Blockchain is running can simply alter a ledger and create a double spend, it has already been done.
Nothing exists sonny until it’s done nothing is guaranteed.

It’s also pointless if the prices are not enough for it to be profitable, no profits no mining no security.

Actually a little research says it is possible also to guess a 256bit private key although unlikely not impossible.
Odds wise it would be like tossing a coin heads or tails and guessing correctly all 256 times.

Just one thing would it be possible for some one to randomly get lucky hacking a bitcoin address, I mean is there a tiny chance someone could put in a private key or a seed phrase that let them have access to the bitcoins related to that address?.
@_date: 2019-10-21 00:26:44
Don’t try confusing the issue
Bitcoins network is secured only by computing power if you take away or lose 90% as a hypothetical scenario that means any rogue player only needs just over 10% of the computing power to effectively hack the network.
Why would you argue this, as there are freely available information of other Blockchains that haven’t got such high security that have indeed been hacked.
Are you so deluded to believe that Bitcoin could go back to a state like 2010 when little monetary value was there and not many knew about it or any kind of network?, simply you can’t! BTC has value at present so it is under attack constantly take away computing power needed to secure the network and it simply becomes hack able.
You’re deluded if you believe this not to be the case, why would a mining pool mine if a situation came along that meant there was no value in BTC anymore (why why why???) so where is the security without the hardware.
Price keeps miners securing the network
The lower the price drops the less secure the network becomes (miners don’t work for free)
The lower the price goes the more the machines are turned off the weaker the network, drop in hash rate means weaker network.
Wouldn’t you agree.
Or are you saying under no circumstances could bitcoin ever fail or be compromised as if you are you’re talking rubbish IMO.
You should read this also about non mining full nodes as you’ve brought it up
What is the real point of running a non-mining full node?
[This article]( does a pretty good job of rebutting the idea that everyone needs to run a full node. But near the end it says:


So can anyone clearly describe those benefits? I'm curious.

Nothing at all about making the network secure from hacks in the scenario I gave you.
I am begging to think you are trolling me as you seem to be not that knowledgable about these issues yourself.
To summarise so you GET IT Bitcoins network is nothing more than making sure it has more computing power than any attacker out there as soon as it hasn’t got that it is susceptible to attack like any Blockchain, Blockchains are nothing if they’re not secure and Bitcoin is also nothing without security.
Get it now if not try this.
The above is what happens when you lose or haven’t as much computing power as the next guy as i told you earlier crypto is not guaranteed safe it’s only safe until it’s hacked ��, nothing is ultimately secure NOTHING!!!.

Good for you if it works, I wouldn’t want wages paid in it unless it was changed into fiat straight away.
Getting paid on a Friday and finding Bitcoins crashed by 1000k put any benefits out the window, but good luck.

You don’t get any of it is the point it’s not referring to me it’s referring to the whole Bitcoin market, you don’t get anything your knowledge base on all to do with Bitcoin is dire at least.
But I’ve given you food for thought use it or you will lose it.
Because I now realise you are clueless you better study a little more before expecting conversations like this (people who don’t answer questions do so because they don’t really know the answers like you).

But it’s not impossible right, just improbable?.
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:06:48
But you can randomly put in a wrong address public key and send to the wrong address?
But no way could someone randomly guess a private key and end up lucky?.
Or is it that it’s not possible until it happens.

How do miners break the cryptographic key to release the Block reward?.
Mining is an arms race against other mining pools, any one with a basic computer in 2009 could mine bitcoins with a block reward of 50BTC basic gaming graphics cards were users to find the nonce or get as close as possible.
The Block reward is cryptographically protected, mining is a means of breaking the code it is no different from hacking.
Why do you think I’m wrong?.
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:34:13
I think the answer to the question  is either a yes or a no,and as I have listened to people in this thread they have said yes it is possible to sent to the wrong address.
I get your scenarios sure but no one intends to make a mistake that’s why it’s a mistake.

Where did they get the Bitcoin from in the first place? They either mined it or bought it even if they’re payed in it the company that pays them bought it with fiat.
Bitcoin is priced in fiat it can’t escape fiat, how much is my bitcoin worth (fiat) how much are those alpaca socks (fiat) how much are my wages (fiat) nobody prices things in bitcoin as it’s always compared into fiat because that’s real value.

Ummm yes I pay less in bank fees even with segwit if your Blockchain becomes clogged up guess what everyone will be paying shit loads in TX fees again.
Nope I don’t live in Greece or Hong Kong great if Bitcoins tiny market serves a tiny few its got a great future NOT.
Bitcoin  doesn’t care it’s not got emotion it’s just code THINK is not something it does (ridiculous), it’s like saying do dollars care.

I love these strong arguments for Bitcoins they’re just a plausible as any I’ve heard on reddit.
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:51:34
No of course gold has no value, apart from all the electronic equipment it’s used in that saves lives and mines bitcoins, no value haha.
Values subjective please don’t be a naive value is money m8 moolar, dosh, greenbacks, subjective is some pussy way of saying bitcoins got none geez hows about I put a dog turd in your wage bag and say value is subjective ummm don’t talk rubbish there are already plenty on here who do in a clueless fashion.

Bitcoins loses a thousand dollars in a matter of minutes sometimes more sometimes less you’re a pure idiot of the highest order.
As for being paid in Bitcoin I can tell you mcdonalds won’t pay your wages in Bitcoin, what you could get is your wages in Burgers that wouldsave you changing anything from anything and a Burger will always be worth one Burger kapesh��.
Refer to my other reply you received don’t msg me or reply to me period I don’t want to here your garbage go and talk with the 4 year olds.

Facts are people in general would still Bank even if interest rates were negative because crypto is to complicated for the masses and way to risky.
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:03:02
Funny I bet the feeling you don’t really understand it yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:36:23
It’d a pyramid scheme it based on new recruits the housing market is a pyramid scheme yet the difference there is not only are houses useful there is also demand and one thing Bitcoin can never have is sustained demand.
If the housing market loses first time buyers it stagnates and if no more buyer were found or needed prices wouldn’t rise because demand wouldn’t be there.
Bitcoin is the worst kind of pyramid scheme as it’s not very useful has little liquidity and demand isn’t constant and sustainable so that in a nutshell spells buyer beware.

I’ve only known about Bitcoin for 4 days and the odd person on reddit seems to not understand it either, after checking what some say you’ll find it not correct at all.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:01:52
Your not so bright are you, the point was clearly you can see the whole markets manipulated Bitcoins have no value it’s a pyramid.
Traders are smarter than hodler boys, traders take hodler boys money they’re taking profits sonny while the sucker money sits and waits for larger price moves, I mean you’ve already said how retarded the early investors you know are never sold even though a year ago prices were at 20k BUBBLE TROUBLE.
And tethers not a shit coin you’re absolutely clueless how to make money aren’t you, tether is a way of taking profits fast before the prices crash, you take your profits and transfer to USDT as it’s a stable coin (clues in the name m8) then they’ll cash out or buy back in.
Let me guess your a bag holder, bag holder mentality came through I’m afraid in your comment.
@_date: 2019-10-22 05:30:22
Yes people use email no doubt they’ll use some form of crypto but it won’t be Bitcoins there are an endless stream of better version only reason people stick with bitcoin is network security.
@_date: 2019-10-21 08:01:50
No thats not correct that I’m a troll and yes I am right INDEED right I’m pleased you’ve seen it now.
I don’t need to answer any of those other questions you’ve answered them yourself as they are on your mind you clearly see they may actually be the truth you run from, funny that ehh.
But as regards a pyramid scheme I never said it was intentional I said it relies on new money which always enriches the earliest adopters and those who own the most bitcoins, I mean seriously do you think those billionaires didn’t see this as easy money perpetuated by sucker money from the lower ranks with less financial know how!.
Bitcoin hasn’t any value if it has no new money the price always collapses or goes down if supply is always larger than demand.
Telling the truth isn’t trolling it’s opening limited minds to the reality of economics.

Bit of an ironic post isn’t it BANKS not responsible WHOS responsible for your Bitcoin hack? No one right.
