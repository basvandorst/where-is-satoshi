what else should "passive income" be?
something like "Dividend and interest income from owning securities, such as stocks and bonds, is usually referred to as portfolio income, which may or may not be considered a form of passive income" ....
no pyramid, just advertise ...

what would happen if there is a backdoor, or it is buggy?  btc could loose its value, but soon another digital-currency will rise up.
on the other site: bitcoin is opensource, and nobody has recognized the backdoor yet? maybe its because everybody just wants to make money, this might make blind.
If there would be a super-tec with prime factorisation w/o time, btc will also get worthless.

if there will be a classic fork, will my BTC exist in core and in classic?
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:41:56
that is no problem, that will offer the possibility to buy BTC at lower prices :-)
(so it might be a problem for miners, paid many $$ for hardware)
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:51:37
thank you.
what about the idea, that miner are mining empty blocks, because empty blocks are smaller and will be faster transferred to get the reward. Bigger blocks will not solve this.

so if bitcoin wants extent current uses (paying a drink in a bar with bitcoin) it has to extent the blocksize.
if bitcoin likes to stay at current blocksize such current uses might want to change to an altcoin, litecoin e.g.
(because it does not make sense to pay a high fee for a little drink and it does not make sense to wait days until payment is confirmed).
