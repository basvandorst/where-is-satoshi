So if their servers a down their hot wallet(s) accumulates spendable funds? If their servers are compromised deposits could end up really anywhere? 
With a smart contract you have neither vulnerability as the hot wallet can always rebalance itself and the code isn't running on only a single location. 
It's worth noting that doing this in Solidity is A LOT less code than would be required using live management.

At least Chris didn't resort to his pod cast's "bro speak / shaming" tactics in this article but he does kinda rely on his audience to not be able to think and by no means be able to read up on anything. 
As an example, follow his logic here:


So: Main contract which needs oracle -&gt; Main contract + Parasite contract -&gt; MAGIC -&gt; Corrupted main contract. How exactly does one go about bribing or corrupting a contract with a dirt simple hash-reveal approach? If participants may only participate with votes they submitted answers for, signed by them, in a hash round. How exactly does one "bribe" the oracle? 
Assuming that he does have an answer for that it should be pointed out that Turing complete approaches can in fact also deal with multisig. Simple tweaks to multisig (max payout amounts, special reward, contest rounds, etc, etc, etc) alone make this a more attractive option. 
Another thing he doesn't address is that state is as much a missing component from UTXO blockchains as scripting. Honestly if Bitcoin had state instead of spent / unpsent, there wouldn't be 90% of the problems we see in Bitcoin and the construction of sidechains today. 
As for the main point of his article. That no-one needs the uses of Turing completeness because subsidizing the use of the network will be to high. This begs the question of if he's read the Ethereum white or yellow papers or if he has any idea what their road map looks like. I don't know if he was personally involved in implementing the EVM on Counterparty, but surely someone has told him about the gas price. It is more of a pay per use model than Bitcoin's is AND Ethereum's inflation (read miner subsidy) will be dropping to 0-2% in the near future. 
Assuming that the blockchain approach does have a hard limit to block-size in terms of how many TPS can be processed. That would simply mean that things that cannot afford to run on Ethereum will not run on Ethereum. That said I doubt this could ever extend to simple value transfers as their gas consumption is fairly low. 
Lastly, no mention is made of the planned sharding of Ethereum. The approach introduces a whole large set of trade-offs that would allow FAR more to be done on the blockchain.
Then again, I don't think the author is acting in good faith so I don't know if he'll be willing to concede any of

Rootstock forks 98% of Ethereum's code and is explicitly designed to leverage Ethereum's ecosystem. Bolting Ethereum onto Bitcoin to create Rootstock is like bolting a  747 onto a Model-T Ford and using the Model-T for landing gear.

Well that's not true, having a set of predetermined rules and strong accounting does remove a lot of coordination and auditing efforts that often accompany inter organizational transfers.

What they would want under those circumstances is to be able to stop deposits (another thing smart contracts could help with if they hadn't already solved the problem). They'd also want any live funds moved to cold storage ASAP. 
The hot wallet simply forwards excess funds to a mulitsig cold wallet. 
As for the risk / cost analysis. It costs about the same as a Bitcoin transaction. The risk that is removed is that only the hot balance can ever be lost if the contract owner key is compromised. And it's all so simple MagicalTux could have safely done it. 
Maybe you need to clarify what you mean by mining overhead. Do you mean blockchain size, networks traffic costs, verification costs or actual mining overhead? Even today, with PoW, the mining subsidy is comparable to Bitcoin and won't exist under CASPER.

That's a terrible conflation. 
1st of all, there was a 2002 and 2008 period where ZAR also "collapsed". Although admittedly JZ has helped make the situation more reliable to those wishing to short ZAR. 
2nd even though the ZAR's purchasing power is decreasing, it doesn't mean the economy is stupid and doesn't factor this into calculations. Argentina has had worse for longer and most people still have food. 
3rd remember collectively there is a lot of opportunity for those who believe the rand is an unreliable form of payment to profit from this and in the process produce a better solution. 
4th by almost every metric that counts people are better off today than they were 10 years ago. Every morning 50 million South Africans wake up, most of them intent on making live better than the day before. The ANC's greatest accomplishment is having somewhat impeded their inherent momentum.

If the limits don't get struck, no fees will develop, we cannot simply keep upping the blocksize every time it gets full. That is exactly the same as having an infinite blocksize. At no marginal cost per transaction, the biggest centers will include all fee'd and all the unfeed transactions they can and sign off those blocks, forcing everyone else out to the point where only a handful of fullnodes will remain.

The government derives it power from the use of force against individuals. Not from the monetary system, although it has used force to corrupt that.
Bitcoin goes beyond addressing the government's power to inflate and addresses the government's capacity to inflict force, by making those it would need to inflict the force against, nearly impossible to identify. (It is simply untrue that the ledger can be tracked long term, the use of HD wallets and other techniques will over time render tracking it impossible).

It does not automatically. It is however akin to playing Russian roulette, even if you are managing it well, you are introducing unnecessary risk that could start a mirriad of bad situations. 
Basically Hyperinflation is a confidence event. Currency becomes a hot potato no one wants to hold because they seriously doubt its future acceptance or value. 
Inflation can get **very** bad and not be a confidence event. Argentina at the moment has very high inflation but it can last for decades more since it is within bounds and few people doubt that it will be accepted in the future or will have 0 value. I live in a country that has in the past had very high inflation (like 20%+). You kinda get used to it.

Oh brother. So liberty is for the selfish, a blockchain working on consensus is as bad a state working with violence and in the end we are all deluded Martians?
OK, so far as "Exit" is concerned, for the sake of the writer, here is what is meant; Capital can exit the grasp of the state as they can no longer reliably see how much anyone is making. Once this happens the state will have to live within its means and provide services within the constraints of its now, massively reduced, budget. So no more $700 billion spent on "defense" to blow up brown people, just cause.

There will definitely still be an incentive to just build specialized hardware. However, the problem with fully connected nodes will be mitigated as no central party will easily be able to manipulate which transactions can and cannot enter the blockchain. This is because everyone would have a full copy and no incentive to exclude transactions. 
Initially, before the hardware develops though, we would see an explosion of full nodes again.

No **individual** was forced to listen to them. There were **lots** of dissenting posts, the individuals involved chose to ignore or chose not to invest more time in reading about and as a result may not have seen.
MtGox had **individuals** defraud other individuals. The defrauding individuals should be held to account not the collectivist notion of "everyone is guilty, no one can be punished".
The most often repeated Bitcoin investment advice I've head from the "majority" has always been; Never invest money or time you cannot afford to lose. 
If someone lost money or time you couldn't afford (like the life savings you talk about in your comment), they were forewarned of the dangers of 3rd party wallet providers, exchanges, MtGox and even the potential risks of the protocol. I really feel for them and a friend of mine lost 250 BTC on Gox, but at the end of the day they took the **risk** and with that comes the potential for gains and the **risk** of loss.

I don't want to misquote him, and he gets quite verbose. But; basically it boils down to getting consensus on non-critical changes to the protocol is near impossible. Scalability issues would break the system as a whole and therefore we might be able to get quick consensus from the involved parties if the cliff loomed.

The velocity of money has a practical upper limit even with bitcoin. Eventually people will only be exchanging money *so* fast and no faster. Then smaller amounts will need to be employed to facilitate large adoption. 
Also the faster people exchange money for real goods and services the faster real goods and services are actually being produced and thus the purchasing power of the money goes up.

Your answer contains valuable points but misses a few things. Firstly, not all places can ban bitcoin in time to stop mass adoption, their governments are just too far behind the curve. Secondly not all governments will ban bitcoin, Hong Kong, Singapore,  Switzerland and Chile have a long history of ignoring the bad policies of the rest of the world. Since Bitcoin is a vastly superior form of money it will eventually become adopted in these places and hard for banning states to explain away it benefits and explain the difficulty of trade their citizens face when interacting with bitcoined jurisdictions. Thirdly bitcoin will facilitate illegal drugs and gambling, both those exist with the restrictions of the dollar and will go loco with even an illegal bitcoin. Lastly, the core community is antifragile, it is a hydra, make trade illegal and it will build a LE resistant exchange system, stealth wallets, plausable deniability tools etc. etc. 
But I agree, legal gets there faster

The only reason your country can afford the insanity that is public healthcare is because it was rich enough to do so BEFORE it was implemented. I happen to live in a country that is too poor to try stupid ideas, yet tries them anyway. Here it is obviously the less efficient way to run things. 
The US has the worst of both world, they have neither nationalized nor private health care. They just have regulations up the wazoo for anything and everything, it is not by any measure a free market in medicine over there. 
Healthcare should not be. 
While there might be some compassion argument to be made for the haves looking out for the have-nots, what you are suggesting is not that they look after them, you are suggesting men with guns imprison anyone who choose not to do it, or to do it differently than the state prescribed mechanism of "charity".
What you call Voodoo economics was once called classical economics in the pre-Keynes. Even Keynes denounced the crazy things they did in his name and governments around the world have become FAR more extreme than they were in the 30s. 
If bitcoins continue to gain value they will continue to gain holders hoping to cash in on that value. You can figure out what that will ultimately do to a currency that does not have the properties Bitcoin has.

Almost all internet traffic today is routed on the rules you say cannot work. 
There are LOTS of private roads in world, in the area where I live there a probably hundreds of gated communities that have internal roads. Ironically the rules there are **more** strict, yet there is no violent enforcement of them. Most of the time the enforcement takes the shape of improved road design, IE bike paths, speed bumps, etc. They are built so cheaply that the "freeloader" problem isn't even mentioned. When there is a choke point, they can get improved and it's in the interest of everyone involved to improve it.

The CIA and the NSA are most likely already using Bitcoin to fund their off book operations. They don't presently have an incentive to kill it. If we became aware of their attack, we would swap out SHA256 for something else and they'd have wasted a significant chunk of cash on the attack. They would then be smart enough not to attack again, so my reasoning is that they are smart enough not to attack now, and rather contribute to projects like DarkWallet indirectly so Bitcoin can serve as a funding channel for them when the federal government needs to make funding cuts. **Remember they have two mandates look (which everyone is up in arms about) and hide...**

The need for justice and safety are **fundamental** needs. They are not unnatural productions of the state. People have an incentive to be safe and have their property, that is in fact why governments form. They are perhaps not the optimal solution to the problem though, and definitely not optimal in their current organization. When there are incentives, problems generally get solved.
**Ancap solutions**
A person can arm himself, especially if he is aware there are thugs on the loose. His community can organize and stop thuggery on a **voluntary** cooperation / donation basis. Lastly, he can hire his own forms of defence. 
**Minarchist solution**
Have a government that only uses punitive measures against truly violent criminals like murders and rapists. The rest of the time hold individuals fully liable for damages they incur and *have them pay it back* instead of "correcting" them in quasi isolation facilities at the cost of others.

Please read up about CoinJoin, "Billions of dollars" will not solve the problem of having simply too many potential targets to track. 
As an example, imagine I am being tracked for some reason and they want to see what I'm spending money on. If I leave money on an automated CoinJoin wallet, it will appear to them to eventually be thousands of potential wallets, all in active use. They will only be able to correlate the data at exit points they are aware are exit points (exchanges, companies with known addresses, etc.) and then launch a far more manual process to get information from there to see if it was in fact the person they are tracing (1000 to 1 it wasn't). They will also not be able to see if the bitcoins simply exited the system in a person to person trade.

Yes, so you are suggesting that perhaps the wallet pays a small connection fee to the node? I saw that DarkWallet has an option to donate to the node you want to use. 
I don't think miners will want to do that as many of them communicate to their pools without any of the hassle at the moment. 
The problem that Satoshi "missed" was that there is incentive to generate dual round SHA256, but no incentive to host the full node. The trick will be to fix the incentives, without *needing* a protocol change.

Oh cry me a revised river. The fact that children once worked in the west was because the west was once so poor that families had trouble surviving without the income. When the west became richer it became affordable to give one's children more leisure time and luxuries as well as oneself. This is evidenced by the fact that even though it is legal to work at 18, lots of people are supported by their parents well into their 20s. Richer people will support their offspring even longer than that.

I think this is the translation problem of the NAP to day to day law.
If you told me you stole something and then ask me if I want to reward your theft by buying it from you, then the principle applies absolutely. I've acted unethically. In a free society the victim would have full recourse against me. When you do that and you didn't actually steal anything, there is no victim and hence there would be no prosecution.
Actual laws about this in a free society would probably work on some sort of sliding scale as to how guilty the people involved can be determined to be. I don't think it will be absolute either/or.

Secondly, "Don't try to turn growing minds into your political tool" sounds somewhat disingenuous when trying to correct someone about critiquing the state school system. It operates largely by "turning people into political tools".

Hong Kong and Singapore are massive financial centres because they don't punish capital, IE low taxes, relatively little regulation ease of moving capital. They actively try to attract the rich and the innovative. Classically Switzerland did the same thing and more recently they've resisted things like joining the EU which has put them in the interesting position of having low import barriers from outside Europe and low export barriers to Europe, meaning they make money just for getting things into Europe.
Chile deserves to be on the list almost more than the others do. While Pinochet was no saint, he did prevent a communist government from taking over the country and after he left it was the most economically free country on the continent and the most prosperous. For comparison visit Argentina, then visit Chile, the difference is VERY large. Argentina only had "mild" socialism compared to some of the other countries in the region.

The reason is that there is a lot more gold than full bitcoins. Also the argument for millions of USD per BTC is based on 
1. BTC replacing the entire money supply and 
2. Bitcoin creating a whole new "crypto-economy."
If gold replaced all the money in circulation you would probably have close to $100,000 per ounce type prices. Gold also will probably not have as many new value adds it can offer as a blockchain technology can.

Regulatory bodies and courts are not the same thing. 
Regulations are justified as attempts at "preemptive justice". In most cases they do nothing but lift the cost of entry into a market. In a large number of cases a thing called "regulatory capture" occurs. This is when people from the companies the regulator is meant to police constantly move from the regulator to the company and back again. Basically this creates a closed system that protects the incumbents from competition. 
People who initiate violence or fraud against others should be taken to court **after the crime actually occurs.**

You sir are a hater, uniformed or both. 
Ethereum's intent is to act as a base on which to build DACs. Too that end it has two fundamental improvements over bitcoin. First contacts have state and do not exist in a binary condition of spent or unspent. Secondly they can run Turing complete code *at a cost per step preventing infinite loops*. There are other improvements specifically aimed at avoiding bugs like malleability, you would know this and the rational behind it if you ever read the white paper or watched a decent interview with Vitalik. 
Ethereum may fail due to mismanagement, but the idea is sound and it or something like it *will* replace bitcoin if those features are not implemented. Given the difficulty of doing something straight forward like increasing the block size, I doubt Bitcoin will ever have these features.

Well Ethereum includes proof of storage in a parallelization resistant fashion. This could be applied to Bitcoin as well, however it would require consensus from the node hosts. 
It is however economically feasible to put a small fraction of coins behind a cloud mining operation that does not mine with the major pool. That mush easier than attempting to do a protocol change. That protocol is pretty much frozen until a severe 51% attack actually happens. The core devs are too conservative to do anything about it until such a time.

On your first point I agree. Bitcoin discriminates based on who owns what (or rather who can proof they have the private keys), however it is open and unbiased with respects to who enters its discriminatory system. 
Secondly, I named bailouts as **an** example. A better example might be government bond auctions where only a select few may bid and then turn around and sell it back to the Fed. This is a near infinite hand out of money. Another, perhaps more pressing example can be found at  that big number near the top is money the current system has given to the government and no-one has any intent to ever pay that off. They may devalue all money to make the number more manageable, but paying it back is not in the cards.

I have no idea why this post made it to the front page. I appreciate that you're trying to be "a voice of reason" but even your facts are wrong. I also don't know how long you've been involved, but you should have seen **2011** now **that** would shake your confidence!
1. There is no need to wait around for an unconfirmed transaction that **has a fee**. None at all. The chances of a 0 confirmation TX **with a fee** not confirming is astronomically small. The moment it is on Blockchain.info it would take a misunderstanding of Bitcoin for someone to insist on hanging around. **Why does this myth persist?**
2. We are basically the first pilgrims building a space station here. Sadly now and then one of us is going to get sucked out the airlock. So much is going on to improve security for the average man it's insane. You can't believe **less** in the viability of Bitcoin based on this, it has only been improving. My first wallet was clear text on my connected windows machine! I have so many options now the mind boggles. 
3. Again, we are the first pilgrims building a space station here. Sadly some of will go to that dodgy space saloon that everyone was warning against repeatedly and get cleaned out at the poker tables. Lots of love for the guys who took a risk on Bitcoin and got burned, you are almost heroes in my eyes, but it was a risky proposition and you knew that. Honestly I don't know if the most of the people who got burned in Gox are as indignant at the "abuse" you say they are suffering. I know a guy who lost 250 XBT, but still has more than that elsewhere. He's not contemplating jumping off any ledges, he's a grown-up who knows the risks, took them and got burned, but is still ahead due to the other risks he took in this space. 
4. Consumer protection will emerge in the form of community review, Bitcoin banks and streamlined escrow. I hope sincerely it never emerges as the government backed de-risked version I suspect you envision. Bitcoin will probably **always** provide a funding mechanism for scammers, **but sometimes you just can't tell the scammer in his garage from Steve Jobs in his garage.**
**In case it is unclear, Bitcoin is the high risk long game, you can get wiped out in this thing, things may very well get worse before they get better.**

If he bought in back then with 1% of his wealth, the Bitcoin market cap would be much higher today and he would be worth a lot more.
There are a couple reasons for this. Firstly he would have caused his own mini rally. Secondly, the market cap is determined at allcoins*price, but as we know there are far fewer than allcoins still accessible. Lastly, his early presence in the market would have put us several years ahead in the eyes of VCs

To put that into perspective, the cheapest way you could do that is to bribe the entire network to include a different transaction with the same inputs. That would cost about $15,000.00 at the moment if you could get the majority of the network on your side. You would also need to be able to contact the pool operators and somehow convince them to forgo long term profits permanently. 
If the strategy above seems infeasible, people can consider plopping down a few billion USD for a chip fabrication plant and a mining centre. Then they don't need all that consensus to steal a few bucks. Of course then they would also not want to ever pay off that fabrication plant or mining centre...

The biggest non-commercial network on the planet is a volunteer driven project in Gauteng (PTAWUG and JHBWUG), South Africa. It delivers higher speeds than commercial internet (although its members are prevented by regulation to use it as a for profit internet delivery mechanism).

The hashing algorithm has been changed a few times. There is a PoC with a testnet running **today**.
The reason the mining algorithm is still under development is because it is being developed so as to be as decentralized as possible for as long as possible. There have been several in detail posts about it and Vitalik has contributed greatly to this field of cryptocurrency.

This is simply not true. 
The need for justice and safety are **fundamental** needs. They are not unnatural productions of the state. People have an incentive to be safe and have their property, that is in fact why governments form. They are perhaps not the optimal solution to the problem though, and definitely not optimal in their current organization. When there are incentives, problems generally get solved.
**Ancap solutions**
He can arm himself, especially if he is aware there are thugs on the loose. His community can organize and stop thuggery on a **voluntary** cooperation / donation basis. Lastly, he can hire his own forms of defence. 
**Minarchist solution**
Have a government that only uses punitive measures against truly violent criminals like murders and rapists. The rest of the time hold individuals fully liable for damages they incur and *have them pay it back* instead of "correcting" them in quasi isolation facilities at the cost of others.

The factual reason I say that it coincides and was not the cause is that there was no evidence that downloads of the bitcoin client or purchases originating from Cyprus increased. Unlike the China bubble which was very clearly an increase on the traffic originating from Chinese investors and speculators
The more general reason I say that is because we a programmed to assign cause to effect, even when no reliable effect can be identified. Nassim Taleb wrote at length about this in the Black Swan (really worth a read). He specifically mentions an incident where bonds weakened and then strengthened in one day. This day coincided with the death of one of Sadam Hussein's sons. The ticker feed read "Bonds weaken on news of Hussein's son's death" one minute and "Bonds strengthen on news of Hussein's son's death" a bit later that day. 
The point is just that we simply never know what causes lots of the effects we see in the world. That said, it might have been Cyprus, but I find that unlikely, it is more likely that was a coincidence. I mention this precisely because none of us are cause and effect gods.

There is an excellent chapter in Nassim Taleb's the Black Swan about how our brains are almost incapable of NOT looking for patterns.
I would highly recommend the book, it really highlights how something like Bitcoin could happen. Bitcoin is a positive Black Swan, it appears too good to be true, but there is a large confluence of "chance" events that make it a completely viable occurrence. It may look overly genius, but I don't think Satoshi thought it would work as well as it has and if he did he may have (thankfully) been a bit delusional at the time.
Regarding the unfinished bits of code and the nature of the code itself; Nakamoto was not a very up to date programmer and his experience might be limited and is very likely dated. If he were a group of people then they would have sources a better coder.

You make a good point the federal government can do IT. It is still very inefficient compared to free market IT, but it does get done, and goes incredibly far in secret.

OK, let's stop short of the name calling or questions of capability or naivety. 
It is known that TOR is a very hard nut for the NSA to crack. TOR like Bitcoin is a open source protocol level approach that anyone can evaluate.  
Secondly, there is very little on P2PFoundation that would reveal his identity and it is a site that he already has an identity on. He doesn't risk creating a new one, making sure his e-mail is secure, etc. etc. etc.
Thirdly, unlike DPR, Satoshi is not under active investigation. DPR was the subject of a major manhunt. The evidence in open court shows that it took the FBI a **long** time, a lot of footwork and a lot of old school warrants to finally catch him.
I would agree that hosting the Silk Road with "a mere couple of software programs" would be very naive. Posting to P2PFoundation once in 4 years from TOR bundle is not going to reveal who you are.

with a lot of respect and gratitude for all the work you've done to improve the ecosystem as a whole, I totally disagree. 
I am flabbergasted by this statement. Bitcoin presently allows for neither state (the main Ethereum "feature") nor funding contained turning completeness. Just how do you suggest either of these will be implemented onto the current blockchain design?
Assuming you have an answer for the above, just how do you intend to gain consensus on a design to stop the billion dollar golden train and hotswop the engine? I mean good heavens you core devs are at each other's throats over far more trivial things! How will such a radical overhaul go down?

First of all there should be legal recourse, something which common law does very well, both to resolve and to prevent these types of things. 
What you are suggesting is **regulation**, the idea that wise overlords will protect us from ourselves, preemptively, before there was a crime or a victim and often when there isn't even intent yet.
Secondly... just because **one** high profile criminal wasn't caught? It was the most enormous of ponzi's yet laid bare, even compared to the ones that existed before any regulations on the matter did, even when adjusted for population and even when adjusted for inflation. They didn't miss "a ponzi", they missed "the ponzi".

Well how technology dispersion works around here is that old phones have to go somewhere. So they start with richer people and a year or two later are with poorer people. Tablets specifically have become readily available and relatively cheap. Poor people (contrary to statist indoctrination) love their children too and can identify trends. So lots of these are making their ways into poorer households.
Significantly, most of the country is covered in 3G and 4G and the 4G is actually getting pretty darn decent. You can access it in Sandton (SA's Manhattan) or Alexandria (a squatter camp).
Also agorism is rampant. There are so many laws and almost not cognition of those laws, so people often just do things. Bitcoin is ideal for here.

The cost of switching has been high due to the network effects of money combined with the manual nature of money. 
As a system collapses the owners of it tend to try to close it off so that they may attempt to extract value from the holders of their scrip as long as possible. 
Example: Zimbabwe was in hyperinflation for a **very** long time. Any savvy Zimbabwean would rather keep USD or South African Rands if they could find them. Over time there were large stashes of Rands, Pula and USD in private hands. This accumulation kept on going until a critical point when there was **enough** for people to start paying for daily life in the alternatives. This then lead to the near over night total rejection of the ZimDollar. The government lost all their monetary slaves in a period less than a month because enough funds had entered the economy to act as a replacement. The accumulation took years.
Enough bitcoin can enter a country to run the whole place **in a matter of minutes!** 
Another example of an 'elegant crash' might be Argentina. Their monetary authority has tried to close off the system, but has a massive gash open in the form of Bitcoin. People can very easily check out of the free falling Peso by holding BTC. A point in time will arrive that Argentinians will find it easier to just transact in BTC than Peso.

You can state that but it doesn't make it true.
1. Ether is simply the fuel that pays miners to do contract calculations. That makes it more useful not less. There are already multiple sub-currencies on top of Ethereum, like Digix which tracks gold reserves. If you don't want to use Ether, then code something with properties you do like on top of it. Here is the ready made tutorial on how to do that:  . Please link me to the tutorials on how to publish high level code to Bitcoin.
2. As it stands now, Bitcoin is at $1,600,000 worth of security per day. Ethereum is at $350,000 worth of security per day, the same place Bitcoin was until about 3rd quarter of 2013, and that after only launching in August 2015.

The market regulates better than the government. People do stupid things, other people see the consequences and don't repeat the mistake and punish the perpetrators by not doing business with them. They also seek common law restitution instead of pre-emptive regulations.
South Africa has MOUNTAINS of regulations. If you think we're just a backwater who can't get regulations *right*, then consider that the SEC visited Berny Madoff 6 times in the period preceding the crash and gave him a clean bill of health... 
I work in the insurance industry as a programmer and one of my main jobs is to find ways around destructive regulations from the financial services board.

Well instead of using code. Build an set of contracts to allow incoming BTC to Ethereum and a peice of signing software that monitors both chains and signs outgoing transactions to Bitcoin. Money would get locked up in one of several massively federated pegs (a peg using both multisig and the additive property of EC) and there would be incentives in place for people to run honest exit signing nodes. Pegs addresses can be retired and their funds moved to new pegs if any of its signers have been seen attempting a breach.

The only benefit of sidechains with pegs to BTC is that they remove the token price risk. They add many layers of complexity and they marry the sidechain to all of Bitcoin's worst problems; developer infighting, mining centralization and ossification. 
If a pegged sidechain develops that solves Bitcoin's core problems, it will become dominant yet still be tied to the main chain's corpse. Ponder that for a second.

OK, so let's examine his radio analogy a bit. (Voldacoin being the coin that shall not be named in So there are two channels, both use FM to transmit. In this case I couldn't agree with him more, if there are two channels in the FM band, you want to piggyback on the one that has the most power behind it. 
However, when you have radically different transmission mechanism, IE not in the FM band, then you would need a transmitter for that band. So now you can't actually use the first transmitter. This does imply that when you have a weak transmitter it will be open to competition. In the FM band the competition has been concluded, but not in this band. 
So what would an attacker need to do to attack the Voldacoin's network. It would need to build a new transmitter for that band. Now it already has a massive amount of concluded competition in Voldacoin's band which it would need to overcome. So it would need to lurk in the shadows until it can achieve 51% (while Voldacoin's hash rate grows btw). Then it would need to pounce upon poor unsuspecting Voldacoin. The attacker would need to benefit **a lot** from wanting to kill Voldacoin as well. If the attacker tries to "gain" 51% of Voldacoin over time, they send a signal that Voldacoin mining must become more competitive and if they don't achieve 51% they are now more invested in keeping Voldacoin alive than killing it. 
**Now let's assume that someone does want Voldacoin dead, can benefit from it and does try. If I were Voldacoin (or a listener to radio) I would simply transmit the last block header of Voldacoin on "FM" and then transmit the block header it appeared on from "FM" on Voldacoin. That would ensure that I have a recent proof of what constitutes the true state of Voldacoin. All of FM's benefits for micropennies on the dollar.**
Now IRL Voldacoin is actually shifting to an entirely different broadcast medium fairly soon. One that still allows it to bookmark to "FM" for micropennies on the dollar and one that doesn't require maintaining the arms race for the world's biggest EM transmitter.

Well bonding would be one major reason as would limiting damage of attempted exit scams. If new addresses were required to bond their entire maximum balance into the set of currently active addresses, they wouldn't benefit from an exit scam since they can only pull it for their own limited fund. The other addresses could then honour user withdrawals from the bonded funds. 
The signers would earn fees upon exit in Bitcoin and side token fees upon entry into the side chain, which is why they would be willing to bond because it's darn difficult to earn BTC denominated interest at low risk. This further invests them in the success of the Gear, Bitcoin and the sidechain.

There are really only 2 players in the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum. There are 4 permutations of what might happen. 
1. Both go down (unlikely) 
2. BTC goes up, ETH goes down
3. BTC goes down, ETH goes up
4. Both go up.
I didn't tell him to buy only Eth and if he believes ETH is over valued at the moment and he can execute dollar cost averaging from prison than sure he can do that. Personally I don't think that will be the case though. I think Ethereum will be worth as much as Bitcoin by the time he comes out. 
I saw BTC go to $31 and then down to $2.5, If I didn't have an opportunity to buy back from 31 to 2.5, I still wish I could have gone ALL IN at $31.

Bitcoinu Akbar!
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:27:34
You misunderstand what I am suggesting. 
As I understand it, EC has an additive property which means we can extend multisig from m-of-n to m(x-of-x)-of-n. The peg itself should exist out of miltiple such multisig addresses with old or compromised ones being retired. No forks are required for this to work at all. 
The DAO would be the new coin issuance mechanism of the side chain. It can run a full/lite Bitcoin node and confirm incoming TX and create tokens on the side chain. It can issue an exit TX which the key holders can then sign. 
Signature violations can be submitted to the DAO which causes it to issue a TX to move funds from a compromised address to an new one. The values of addresses (x,m,n) should be set up so that the remaining signatories can with a high probability still move funds to a new exit address. 
Regarding who watches the watchmen. The TX mechanism above can be used to alert when people are signing things the DAO software didn't issue. The watchmen can earn fees in the side chain (incentivising them not to harm it) and upon successful exit. They can also be bonded in earlier Bitcoin entry/exit addresses and on the sidechain. 
As a measure of last resort the DAO could cause the sidechain fees to increase if a entry/exit pocket was successfully attacked and tokens no longer match exactly. The fees would be burned until parity is reached again. If the rest of the scheme is properly configured, this might never happen, but Bitcoin side risk should be sized so that this scenario is insignificant anyway.
Absolutely no forks are required for this in Bitcoin. The most generic way to do it would be to have a sidechain template that has some form of OP_EXIT functionality and OP_ENTER functionality that can be additively signed by a large group of participants. Then DAO software could be written that manages the appointment of signatories and is gets configured to interact with a sidechain. So Bitcoin DAO, Gear DAO, Sidechain DAO.

First off, the spammer is wrong in his approach. 
Secondly, Ethereum works today, has things running on it today. The 14 month old  link you refer to on Counter Party has how many functional dApps on it...? 
Thirdly, someone offered to short Ethereum, how is that a "lower offer that did not go through"? Also if he kept his end of the bargain, he was wiped out as Eth has never fallen to past 3x its presale value in BTC.

There is a difference between occasionally being a jerk and making a habit of it. Even Gavin said he suspects one of the reasons Satoshi left was because he knew he wasn't the right personality to take things forward. 
It's one thing to build a system, prove it works and then budget your time to not fight the opposition. It's another to write a long article detailing your thoughts on a subjective matter and then link to it elsewhere as proof of your superiority.

Sathosi for all his genius did not output very well architected code. If they were a team and they had that expertise in economics, cryptography and operational security, it's fair to assume that they would have applied the same diligence to selecting a programmer. Point in case Bitcoin started off as Windows only, it's very unlikely that even if they had to select a coder and had to for other reasons select someone "so-so" that they would have settled on starting an opensource project in C++ on windows and not at least Linux. 
 imho, it was one brilliant man who had a brilliant idea.

@_date: 2015-04-30 10:37:02
Here's more details. 
What do you mean by "when investors started selling GLD huge volumes of physical gold hit the markets" How does that correlate? If GLD is a fully backed security, selling it is simply transferring it from one owner to another, the gold backing it should still be in the fault backing the certificate. If people were redeeming their GLD for gold, thereby reducing the number of outstanding GLD certificates, then selling the physical gold I could understand how GLD reserves could enter the market again. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:15:32
Then they started acting as reserve certificates that almost no one could claim for, could be contractually settled in fiat even if the comodity was claimed and currectly suppresses the true price of both those commodities. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:18:46
Well they set out to make an opensource high volume exchange platform... So I guess when they decided they don't feel like doing that anymore is where things went south. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:34:01
Probably because of the network effects of exchanges. I don't think I've ever held a yuan in my life, guess where my bot trades...?
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:18:06
If they use anything like the mechanisms for Gold / Silver it will push the price down. I really doubt that if they are fully backed today they will remain so for long. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 14:29:08
Dude, I love you and all **but no friggen way are you right about complexity's relationship to security**.
1. Political systems are dynamic, they can be adapted. They can seek dynamic equilibrium. A blockchain that hides information in the open **can not afford that as a process!**, it needs a viable (albeit suboptimal) point of equilibrium. 
2. Airplanes and space craft are NOT, I repeat NOT, what you want to be modeling. Those things are complex because their simplest implementations have not yet been discovered. We haven't experimented enough with them. Unless you want teams of engineers to be the only people who can operate Ethereum when it's done, you can't rely on the same approach. 
If you settle on a faulty basis for consensus and a faulty intensives model all you will end up accomplishing is an Althereum with a clean genesis block that ends up out outmaneuvering Ethereum simply because it didn't contain obvious exploits that weren't obvious at Ethereum's launch.

Predominantly stealth, plausible deniability and multi sigs held by people you trust under strict instructions when to sign and when not to sign.
1. Don't let on you have bitcoins, how much or in what addresses.

Arrests are based on reasonable suspicion. What you described is a PURELY pragmatic argument. Since the state has near infinite resources why do they not simply throw an equal measure of money at the problem?? 
That's rhetorical in case you were wondering.
What you are entertaining sickens me. What it incentivizes is the further growth of financial regulations categorized as crimes. If the defendant is viewed as "having obtained the funds through a criminal activity" the state may simply seize all defense funds and throw the fellow in rape cage.

If a 2 way peg did work and it didn't require a protocol level change to bitcoin, only that BTC be convertable to the sidecoin and back again, then why would Bitcoin need a larger blocksize? And can't we then cram the features as we need them into the side chains? Including perhaps purpose built side chains for high transaction volume?

Well Ethereum has state, so instead of a TX only being spent or unspent, we now have balances and contract storage, both those are serious departures from how Bitcoin works. 
Ethereum has Turing completeness, which is actually trivial to implement and apparently is already possible in a hacky way in Bitcoin.
Ethereum has gas pricing which, afaict, solves the block size issue. Bitcoin has people at each other necks.  
Ethereum's existence owes itself to the fact that made the call that it would be faster to implement everything from scratch than that fastest way he could see to move from Bitcoin to the feature Ethereum now has. 
He (and all his backers) took a massive gamble that the new network would reach critical mass before a "good-enough" Bitcoin sidechain. If Rootstock wins, those backers (I'm one btw), have basically funded a charitable en-devour. Either way though, freedom and individual liberty wins.

Firstly, Bitcoin is only "the-most-secure" chain against a theoretical attacker who would have incentive and means to attack it. It is not very secure against centralization, the only cure for which would be to switch to a "less proven algorithm" in case a mining cartel is proven to censor transactions. At present Ethereum runs on SHA3 and has an army of GPU miners on it. Before centralization happens they intend to switch to a variant of PoS (in about 9-10 months). Even straight forward PoS provides ECDSA backed security which needs a signature or set of signatures from an account holding the token. Even with only one ECDSA signature, the entire bitcoin network would never be able to resign that block without the original key, since there is only one target value and not a set of target values as with PoW double round SHA256 threshold targeting. PoS has been said to hold risks like nothing at stake, which the Ethereum PoS scheme addresses by insisting on a bond from the staker. However, since PeerCoin has been running for years and is still unhacked, this attack too remains theoretical. 
Secondly, Rootstock is an **awesome** idea. Really, it's almost inspired. Unfortunately they have not yet submitted a feasible 2-way peg. I'm not saying they don't have one, but I've asked a bunch of times and they have mostly been hinting at a n-of-m multisig entry and exit wallet. Those are limited to x-of-7 uncompressed addresses and x-of-15 compressed addresses. They say they "just want a workable system" to start with. Ethereum is currently at about 36 million USD. Even if RootStock's token was backed by the more widely accepted bitcoin, it will not grow to that level if it's entire backing could be compromised by manipulating less than 15 key holders. 
Thirdly, there are a great many awesome projects in this space that never got off the ground. Ethereum, for all the hate spat at it, is not one of those, its token may fail but its underlying concepts and the functionality is allows is so important that a whole team of people is willing to run a project to try and allow the same functionality that is working on Ethereum **today** on Bitcoin based tokens.

If Ethereum fails (IE it's token crashes). It will be a signal that the funding model that they used to create the technology is not safe. Their crowd sale was at the time the second biggest in history, the biggest being StarCitizen, both pre-sold digital goods. 
Some projects could still be crowd funded after this point, but in the absence of investor returns, we can expect the numbers to be far smaller (dark wallet being a good example of an important project with relatively little funding) 
It would be unfortunate for this space if this is the case is it means that innovation relies on rich benevolent parties to fund real progress for tech that moves the common good forward and not grass roots finance.

I don't know if your bank still runs things on hardware from the 70s but MySQL can outperform any blockchain without even knowing it was a competition. 
Honestly log shipping to multiple sites with joint security review is as safe as a "private blockchain" and a good shot easier to maintain and a heck of a lot faster. 
Blockchains are for maintaining consensus under potentially adversarial circumstances. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:59:19
Because unless they come up with a workable 2-way peg that isn't just a 4-of-7 multisig they **can't** "just take the features that work".

Sidechains: They have replied that they intend to use a federated peg to start off with and then mount the flying unicorn (IE, something like what blockstream is reportedly developing). 
Miner incentive is fees on the side-chain. These will be high if Rootstock can leverage Bitcoins current network effects.
Orphan blocks are resolved using Ethereum's Uncle resolution mechanisms. 
Ethereum is non-SHA256 and has a mining pool larger than what botnets can attack. It's as safe Bitcoin for all intents and purposes, because attacking it at this point creates more incentives to just look after it. When this shifts to CASPER (their PoS algo which solves "nothing-at-stake"), security will be based on betting that a certain tx set will reach consensus, and losing a portion of your stake if you bet on a non-winner. Basically it takes the investment behind mining and makes it direct instead of indirect. Secure? Probably more than it needs to be.
Whichever sufficiently flexible smart-contract system has network effects first will win, and everyone will mine there. Right now Rootstock is betting that they can get to that point before Ethereum does, Ethereum has already bet that they can get there before any Bitcoin sidechains that have their base functionality can. 
You are right, they are evasive, at least at the moment. I suspect this is because of the criticisms regarding their mention of federated pegging. They've stated they will release their design (white paper) at the Mexico Bitcoin conf and that they've "sent copies to prominent Bitcoin community members including Nick Szabo". Mailing Nick my rocket ship blueprints doesn't make me SpaceX though, but who knows, maybe they have something. 
Sidechains would be used to leverage the network effects of Bitcoin. Sidechains would also have network effects, the most useful one will probably see 80% of the activity. 
Shapeshift is convenient, but it's not as cool as a sidechain would be.
Bottom line; if Rootstock succeeds, the Ethereum chain withers and dies, and the devs join Rootstock dev. If Ethereum wins, Bitcoin withers and dies due to lack of features.

@_date: 2015-10-03 15:09:55
Well as I have it another way to do it would be to have a massive multisig wallet. Then the side chain needs to monitor the entire bitcoin blockchain, and somehow instruct holders of a seeding set of keys to release bitcoins on the bitcoin blockchain when necessary. Of course how would those keys be maintained and kept safe?

Also the project is working. At this stage it can still be made irrelevant if a clone was launched as secure 2-way pegged sidechain.

I agree that it would not affect backwards compatibility, but neither would increasing the block size. 
BIP65 had to gain consesnus among the developers and the miners before it was pulled into the main code. Older clients could not spend UTXOs that were dependent on that opcode. IE sooner or later they would have had to upgrade too.
I simply do not follow how you can suggest that implementing the myriad of features that Ethereum has working right now (the biggest of which is state which is in direct contradiction to the UTXO model) without a consensus battle an order of magnitude bigger than the one regarding block sizes.

Here's my take on the same idea.
Bitcoin is gaining in popularity. As the cobwebs get cleared from people's minds this will gain a lot of traction. 
The main target audience for bitcoins at this stage are libertarians. I attend a monthly Libertarian dinner and of the 15 odd attendees only 3 too initiative to go out and buy their own bitcoins. Lots of them own gold however. 
The libertarian ownership of gold is going to drastically increase in the near future imho. There is a conference being held this weekend by Jeffery Tucker with lots of people from the Mises crowd. Mises.org to this day does not accept bitcoin to my knowledge. They are now intermittently posting "it is money it isn't money". Once they decide as Jeffery Tucker has decided that this thing is undoubtedly a sound money I suspect the influx of gold hording libertarian types will begin en masse. This will probably be bubble 3.0, spiking the price way up and settling it on a plateau much above where it is now.
I have been around for both bubbles now and have been watching this idea grow from $0.33 / BTC to where it is now. I wrote an email in feb'11 to 4 of my friends that they should look at it ($1.10) and another follow up one a month later at ($1.60). I knew conceptually that the idea was sound but didn't believe people would get involved, and not as quickly as they are getting involved. If I had trusted myself and taken out a loan after the first bubble popped I would have a respectable nest egg now.
Currently my plan, if I can get a loan, is to buy $10,000 of bitcoin and liquidate them to pay the due payment every month. Hopefully before now and the end of the loan the remaining bitcoins will be worth substantially more than $10,000.

No I haven't conceded it. Taking purchasing power from people with low debt or high cash and giving it to people with high debt or no job is not a good thing. It doesn't matter if there is no apparent inflation, the holders of cash would have been better off if the printing did not happen.
The government simply doesn't know where to spend money. So it spends it anywhere a politician / bureaucratic feels important. The money attracts people who should have been doing things that people would have volunteered their money for, to do things. IE people want cheaper cars, they get hospitals in places that didn't need them.

Problem with Gold market it tradable futures contracts. There isn't really a reliable physical price discovery mechanism.
XBT is not suseptable to this as would be more liquid than any futures contract created on top of it. 
So if XBT breaks fiat then the banks will no longer be able to extend infite short contracts since they can't print money any more.

@_date: 2013-06-03 13:27:34
Velocity is important, but more so in confidence events than in general inflation.
A confidence event I define as when people finally lose trust in the security or currency and it becomes a hot potato that cannot be handed off to the next person fast enough. With currencies this can happen once people are convinced it will lose value and that conviction is backed up by printing or when they are convinced their government is now bust and the new one will not be accepting the old currency. The latter can happen without printing. In either case velocity speeds up to as fast as the economy in question can conduct business. This worsens the inflation beyond what can be accounted for by just money supply increases. 
Velocity is constrained under "normal" circumstances. There might be several factors that speed it up or slow it down but ultimately velocity will not increase dramatically if the users of the currency don't believe that holding it is that expensive. 
Some of the "non-inflation" could be explained by a slow down in the rate of transactions but given that the data I mention spans 10 years for both countries I don't think that either of those could be explained by the velocity of money. 
Also it's been almost 5 years since the crises, velocity has by all accounts likely slowed down in the US, which would account for the lack of inflation, but it has not completely stopped nor does it discount my main argument that M3 has not grow significantly.

If the mob cannot force someone who pulls ahead to redistribute his good fortunes then you will have anarco-capitalism.
Regarding the eventual end game socialism I suggest you give Eugene Richter's "Pictures of the Socialistic Future" a read. It was written some 50+ years before Germany had any socialism imposed on it. It predicts the end game as a wall with guns, pointing inwards, to prevent escapees. &lt;insert cold chills and visions of the Berlin wall here&gt;. Before Lenin, Stalin, Che, it was possible to see that the end of socialism would be a near all powerful state that would enslave men. 
Again, if you are willing to let people act in their own best interest in parallel with your suggestions then you are an Libertarian Socialist. If you won't allow people who produce and trade in peace without using physical coercion or fraud to gain wealth to do as they please then whatever you are suggesting will deteriorate into tyranny.

Why then did the implementation of Marx's ideas follow the same pattern over and over, producing Stalin after Stalin where it went? Even Che was just a mini-mass-murderer. 
Fundamentally, if you cannot force people to give up the control and ownership they enjoy for the greater good, they will choose to retain that control. In anarchy, this leads to a market economy. In a massive state this leads to tyranny.

I can't get clarity on that. I know that the 6 confirmation standard is arbitrary in the default client. It doesn't consider coins valid until 6, but they are on the block chain.

Hey man, I feel your pain.
On a conceptual note, you are way ahead of the curve and you may be undervaluing that about yourself. Start a small position in bitcoins, even at today's crazy prices it's a steal to what I believe it will be. If I believed myself in 2011 when I wrote an e-mail to my friends when it was at $1.10 then I'd probably be able to retire now. 
On a personal note. There is nothing quite as frustrating as being the "smartest" guy in the room and being hated for it. Maybe check your tone and attitude when you convey these ideas. Even then though people might react badly. Read some of Eli Goldratt's work on conveying ideas to people who are resisting them. Really enlightening stuff.

You own yourself, by extension you own the results/fruits of your actions, by further extension you own whatever you traded with others in voluntary informed exchange. This is logically evident to almost anyone. Straight forward goods and physical items fall in this category.

As Ghandi said  “I am prepared to die, but there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill.”
That said; innocent until proven guilty. The FBI is not above framing him to kill his support. I mean lets face it, if we believed he were innocent of the kill orders we would be dressed like DPR protesting outside the prison like mad men.

No, countries where there are rich people are countries where it's generally not bad being poor. Countries where there are fe rich people are countries where it's fatal being poot. 
Inequality doesn't matter as much as having freedom to produce and trade. Bitcoin is *anti* cencorship, an Iranian musician can use it regardless of whether Chuck Schumer thinks its wise or not.

Voluntary socialism is more accurately called Anarco-Socialism / Anraco-Syndicalism. Socialism as expounded by Marx has never worked without theft at gun point. Bitcoin breaks that model by giving the gun nowhere to point and making it ineffective when it fires. 
Bitcoin is possibly the biggest jump forward we've made in private property in the internet age. Respectfully, the people on that thread don't understand economics, if they did they would flee XBT like the plague because it is antithetical to what they say they want. However their intention is most likely just a more equal distribution of wealth an they don't realize the role the state and violence in general has played in the concentrations we see today, from that angle they should embrace it. 
Why did Marx throw out the chamomile? Because he hates all proper tea ;-)

I am a libertarian. I can understand the multiple facets of Bitcoin and would totally understand why it would go viral even if it didn't include anonymity. 
The fact is however that things like CoinJoin and Darkwallet are real and the blockchain explicitly provides multi-input, multi-output transactions that will render taxation difficult once people catch on to the possibility. I'm not supporting the idea, I'm simply mentioning that it is going to happen.
Also the limited money supply is a big change for China, the communist party might as well be the libertarian party of China without it.

Well if the common cause is to remove violence and coercion from society then I would argue, whatever your goals are beyond that, you are a libertarian. 
If you don't like rich people, that's fine, if you want them to give their wealth away, that's fine too. The line is if you are willing to use violence (personally applied or outsourced to the state) to take one groups goods and give it to another group.

Negative freedoms are essentially free and everyone's fundamental moral obligation to their neighbours, IE leave them and their stuff alone. 
Positive freedoms in an environment where negative freedoms are respected is fine, it means people worked to afford those things.
Positive freedoms cannot morally be extracted from peaceful citizens, IE you cannot FORCE others to pay for privileges you think society should enjoy. 
Also places where positive freedoms flourish under apparently socialist systems are typically places where negative freedoms were long respected. Sweden is a great example of this as their socialism is installed on top of a functional economy. The US is an example of how you can't afford socialism if you already have a large amount of violations of negative freedoms. 
A better example is Hong Kong where very few positive freedoms are guaranteed but violations of either are very rare and the population is generally very, very wealthy and healthy. 
PS I don't support things like universal healthcare etc, but if you MUST have them, it helps not to be stealing money from you citizens for everything else as well.

As I say elsewhere my explanation is a simplification. 
If I loan you money, you are correct, the money is not destroyed. But that is because I don't have a legal right to issue you spendable fiat. I have to get the money somewhere and then loan it to you. When you have it, I have to wait to get it back. When you pay it back, you no longer have it and I do. 
But imagine I could create a negative book entry for you and a positive book entry for you and link that into the existing banking system. In other words "print" accounting entry money. Now the game changes. Now when you pay me back all I'm doing is lowering the amount you owe me by the principal and keeping the rest. 
Sometimes there is an extra step where the banks need to lend money from the reserve bank at a low interest rate and only then may they loan it out at a slightly higher interest rate. But the reserve bank is still executing the process seen above.

The application would have to be pure SMS. There is no probability of increased smartphone penetration there any time soon. They even still have a ban on Blackberry phones.
USSD won't work either as one would need to work past the oligarchs to get it implemented. 
SMS will work because we can see the sending number. If we suspect the system is compromised in some way by the cellular operators (This is Africa), an authorization procedure could be implemented.
The SMS systems already exist in several forms. They unfortunately don't take into account that there are places where it is prohibitive to send an SMS outside some countries. It really might be just a case of getting a local implementation and then getting some donation support to seed liquidity.

If you could validate the transaction and check the inputs against the blockchain you can just have them sign the transaction, transmit it to the network and leave. The probability that they can generate a competing transaction in time for the next block is very small. It's similar to carrying a black light around so that you can validate cash, there IS a chance you get ripped off but it is very small. 
Computers will be able to sign massive amounts of transactions and then submit them to the block chain as they get time. If a transaction proves fraudulent (IE a double spend was submitted before the tx in question) they will essentially have a signed contract for an amount that would become admissible in court as evidence.

As I understand it, and I don't understand it as well as I understand other aspects of bitcoin, the network should be able to scale to the point where it can handle all current credit card transactions and cash transaction pretty much in real time. This is on existing hardware and does not take into account the continued trend of bitcoin-purpose built hardware.
There is a decent amount of room for flexibility in the code base to allow for more efficient processing and validation of transactions. Remember that there is also a fee incentive to clear transactions faster if the network begins to lag in responsiveness. Meaning there is room to solve a future speed problem and a large incentive to solve it. 
If people start doing enormous amounts of micros-transactions because now they can, I am not sure what the effect will be on the network as the volume of these might vastly exceed all credit card and cash transactions in our current throttled system. Again, the fee incentive will probably grow to process important (to the sender) transactions.

Was thinking the same thing. 
How about this. Embed a small reward in each layer of the packet. The reward can be something that the relay can collect large amounts of and then hand in as a proof that it did participate in the forwarding of the packet to some market / blockchain. 
Example: Wrap secret keys to wallets with small amounts in them. The relay might need to open many packets before it might find a reward. The relay has an incentive to keep opening packets AND forwarding them because it wants to reward the payers with communication so that they keep paying. All this will prove to anyone is that a bitcoin address' owner (who is unknown) at some point used the TOR network (for something unknown).
The above example is a bit socialistic in that the payers will increase the speed of the whole network, not guaranteed their communications.

They are post hyperinflation. They will probably not have it soon unless the USD hyper-inflates. They need a banking system, a currency that can do something simple like make change.

Voluntarist socialism is libertarianism. Libertarianism's core has to do with when violence is justified. You can then extend that into personal or collective wellfare as much as you like. 
Anarco-capitalists simply say that if you leave people alone to do as they please (IE anarchy) the natural result will be bottom heavy capitalism (IE lots of mom and pop, but lots of disruption too).
This is why Amir Taaki (a left anarchist) and Cody Wilson (an anarco-capitalist) can make common cause. They don't support the use of coersion by governments. 
The implementations of socialism that we've seen over the last 100 years have almost all resorted to state run violence to accomplish their goals.

I think what is happening is the older investors are primed to expect a bubble. So we are seeing very strong consolidations from them waiting for sale oppurtunities. We didn't see this in the first bubble this year.

Interesting, using the disruptor/prevaylor pattern, I had the same idea.
I think this concept is very good and would like to suggest an extension.
Instead of writing an opensource system alone to improve future exchanges, why not also add an "inter-exchange" element to the system.  Basically exchanges can be set up similar to Diaspora pods. So if I wanted to start an exchange to my local currency I can start up a pod and register it as an exchange between BTC and ZAR (South African Rands). I could then transfer my BTC to an account with another exchange pod that trades between BTC and USD. All seemlessly within the network of exchange pods.
Furthermore reliability information about the specific exchange could be uploaded, Ie an audit of my ZAR account signed by a reputable audit firm or two. 
Having the interchange feature would also allow more interesting things to be priced in BTC. Like Coffee beans for delivery in June by an east African local farmers group. Price discovery can be very well greased by this for far more than just BTC.

If you are using something like 12 words I agree. But you can employ other strategies to ensure entropy. IE use highly complex passwords, repeats, etc. The entropy is still less than a random number generator but building a generic system to search all such strategies isn't viable. 
The only reason I like brain wallets is because they can be written down.

Firstly you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. You could spend $10.
Secondly, the sub-prime derivatives were symptomatic. The cause was the cheap credit the fed made available that could leech into housing pushing the prices of houses and related securities much higher than the underlying value.

Not even they control their government. It is unarguably a better one than the US. 
I'm not an every man for himself kind of guy, I'm an efficiency kind of guy. If you take the benefits provided by the tax and look at the purchase price of those benefits, it is still does not add up. One can easily purchase word class transport, education and healthcare for WAY below 65% of your total income.

No worries man, thanks for replying. 
Basically what I have in mind is to come up with a standardized means of hashing brainwallets that is more expensive than the single round SHA256 most places uses currently. As a "pirate" of the brainwallet seas, your input would be grand.
The first problem is the cheap cost of building a massive brainwallet -&gt; sha256 dictionary of addresses and just having a bot monitor them for incoming funds. As I have it one only needs a copy of the blockchain and the precompiled dictionary. I'm unclear what hardware guys are using for this. Do they have just custom FPGAs or are they ASICs? Either way, just adding more SHA rounds is already an improvement. Additionally to this I was thinking of doing something like 
Round(X) = SHA256(Brainwallet + Scrypt(Round(X-1)))
Round(0) = ''
With a minimum of 1000 rounds.
Would this significantly increase the cost building the dictionaries or am I missing something. 
The next problem is entropy. Brainwallets don't seem to have much. Aside from the cost increase suggestion above, if a brain wallet were to ad 32bits of true entropy, would that significantly increase the cost to mining them? 
IE Brainwallet + Random(0,2^32)
I suggest this because in the event of forgetting the entropy part, the brainwallet could be input and the funds retrieved since there are only 32 bits of entropy to go look for. The entropy of the brainwallet itself + the 32 bits of entropy would deter mining for them.

Paul Volcker tightened momentary policy and the inflation of the 70s was stemmed. 
If monetary policy were to tighten today the ones who suffer would be the ones in debt, the foremost of which is the federal government. For every point rise in interest rates their interest obligations would increase and their tax incomes would decrease. 
Inflation however would not happen. There will be a major incentive to pay off debt and not make any new debt. Money will move fast only towards paying off the debt it was created from.
