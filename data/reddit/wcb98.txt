The true biggest dogecoin tip was worth $3000, and was tipped to the creator of the dogetipbot. It isnt listed because the chart said they exclududed tips to the creators of the bots.

I have to admit, I am impressed by how much you found out. And you are correct that 'wcb' are my initials. I actually didn't self teach myself programming until I was 14ish. Still a bit surprised about how you got my location, and age. If you don't mind, would you tell me where you got them from? Haha, here I am thinking I am pretty anonymous on the internet :P It certainly is scary how much you can find out about someone on the internet. Google's Google Glass have facial recognition software included, which wiill make searching for someone on the web even easier than before (A bit scary)

pretty immature and unrelated to the topic at hand.

not a clone. If anything, it can be said it is a litecoin clone because it uses the same mining algorithms. But even this is false. Take a look at it defently has something to offer to crytocurrency.
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:30:22
I would say they are a friendly community, and have lot of giveaways :)
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:13:48
Of all the people to give 1000 doge to... lol
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:25:00
"oh well"
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:16:41
On the contrary, I seem to always hear on the doge news a new group they donated X amount of dogecoins for, and tends to leak a lot into other crypto subs
EDIT: as an example, [this]( fundraiser is going on right now
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:28:30

@_date: 2014-02-20 20:36:06

@_date: 2014-02-20 20:35:21
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:33:47
Try digging into me ;D I may be a little harder to find information about.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:18:42
I can see your point, but in a month it has become the 3rd most popular crytocurrency, passing other currencies that have been around for much longer.
@_date: 2014-05-18 01:55:12
