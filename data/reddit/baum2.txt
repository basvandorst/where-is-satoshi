That's an option, yes. It wouldn't be too much of a (surprise) gift, though. Hm... I'll keep it in mind as a less than ideal solution.

You got this mixed up. Bombing Syria is about ending human lives.

Thanks, this is in fact almost identical to what I did in the end!

So you're either part of the 1% or are defending their completely random right of abusing others in hope of becoming one of them eventually?
Some people never learn...

Under real world conditions, it's probably the most convenient option when going for secure storage.
Especially, as the number one issue, i.e. losing your hardware wallet, is not an issue at all (if precaution are taken when setting it up).
Don't bother with it if you're looking at buying a couple of bitcoins only, though. If you decide to invest a significant part of your live savings or retirement money in bitcoin, you better make sure it's stored in a safe environment. The practical alternative to a traditional hardware wallet such as a Trezor one would be an 'offline only' retired computer with additional backups of your file(s).

Aren't dogs man's best friend?

Transform? Perhaps, in a technical sense. Revolutionise? No, not by relying on blockchain tech alone.
For now and the forseeable future, studying, testing and playing with bitcoin is the way to go for the financial sector - not hoping for blockchain tech to cure their broken system.

And you're saying that's not mental? Even if if was true which it obviously isn't.

This is simply not true. Go and read up on the German Welfare System - or, more specifically, Arbeitslosengeld.
