as a proud Canadian from Québec i must say that you guys say its fine its fine usd is fine..... myself when i take a look at your prices  i have to do x2 basicly  ratio is like 0.70 cad for 1 usd... in Canada most of the people dont realise this and keep saying : Wow this is expensive , wow they are a bunch of thieves etc etc but infact we lost our purchasing power by alot  just this year!!!   i am panicking a bit and clearing all debt atm! no car payment soon no credit card just my small mortgage wich thanksfully isnt big like all my friend
