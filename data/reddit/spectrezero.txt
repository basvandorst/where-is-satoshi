You think btc will go to 15k in 20 weeks?
It could drop 20% right after the fork.

China is very concerned about the outflow of currency. Bitcoin allows people to move large amounts of currency out of the country, and bypass currency controls.

Other way around. Place a limit order to avoid fees:
"MAKER VS. TAKER
When you place an order at the market price that gets filled immediately, you are considered a taker and will pay a fee between 0.10% and 0.25% for BTC books and 0.10% and 0.30% for ETH books.
When you place an order which is not immediately matched by an existing order, that order is placed on the order book. If another customer places an order that matches yours, you are considered the maker and your fee will be 0%."

Sure, but I think my dollar will be worth 2.50 tomorrow, I'm not spending it today unless I absolutely have to. Then, when I go buy bread, the price is 25% higher today, in anticipation of the increase in value tomorrow. It can be a death spiral for an economy.
Why do you think we aim for 2% inflation and not 2% deflation?

Plenty of banks are looking into bitcoin. I work at a small community bank, and we are looking into opportunities presented by Bitcoin and other blockchain tech. It's our regulators that get nervous when the word comes up.

Really? Even if bitcoin succeeds, and I hope it does, fractional reserve banking is what allows millions of people to own homes and buy what they need. If banks couldn't loan out deposits, where would the money for everything people borrow money for come from? 
If you force banks to lend tier 1 capital, you would cripple the economy. 
Rather than lending $500,000 to 5 different people (for a total of 2.5mm) for 3% APY and maintaining reasonable capital, LTD, and liquidity ratios, lending companies (not even banks, because why would they take your deposits if they can't lend them out?) could only lend that $500,000 to 1 person. In that case, those people who want the loan need to compete for that loan by essentially bidding, driving up interest rates.
What's the plan then?
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:36:49
Don't use the word Normie. That would be a good start.

People can already borrow money from each other. But if someone needs a  30 year, $1.6 million loan on a $2.0 million house (80% LTV) in 45 days, there aren't many people that can close that loan on a personal level. 
Also remember, when you lend that money to someone, you can't just ask for it back when you need it. That's why you deposit it at a bank, and the bank pays you interest. The bank maintains the liquidity and capital ratios so they can lend out money to others while ensuring you can always get your money out of you need it.
Banking is much more than just moving money around. Moving the money around is the easy part, it's all the other stuff that goes along with it that makes banking so difficult.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:41:42
Not all banks have these clauses. I work for a community bank, and we don’t have it. 
Pick better banks to do business with. You may not get free accounts (because we have to pay to maintain them too), but you’ll be treated better. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:27:28
I'm well aware. 
I'm not sure how you concluded that the success of bitcoin will be the end of fractional reserve banking.

Don’t forget to balance the ledger every block by flipping it over, and rotating (N, E, S, W) about once every 12 hours. If you don’t, you’ll get bch instead of btc.

You still have a telecom company don't you? The pager is just the medium, like a debt card. We may not have debit cards in the future, maybe we'll only use digital NFC chips. But behind all of that, there is a bank system. It will look different in the future, but the principle will still be the same.
Banking is the  plumbing system of the economy. Credit cards may not always be around, but the concept of credit is crucial for an economy to grow. What is the purpose of a bank in society? It's to provide credit. Banks don't want to deal with deposits, they have to in order to provide liquidity for loans.

At more Bitcoin owners die off by old age or accidents, I can see “crypto currency recovery” as a significant business. 
I did the same thing as the writer for my wife, “if I die, so-and-so can help you. He needs these words: “
Eventually, I realized I had more risks. A home burglary or a fire could wipe out everything. My solution was a 2nd Trezor with the same keys at a relatives house (still pin protected). 
I’m still constantly worried that something could happen, and I could lose everything.
People are thrilled at he possibility of doing away with banks, but they rarely consider that banks have huge investments and experience in making sure they don’t lose critical customer information.

Thank you for this time.

I work in the bank industry (community bank), and this is not anything I have ever heard. Banks are interested in blockchain tech for the replacement of the current core processor systems that process once a day, at the end of the day.
But banks are as worried about consumers using bitcoin as they are worried about people who hold their assets in gold. 
Banks have way more to save/gain by using blockchain technology than they do to lose to it.

How does someone make enough to invest $200k in Cryptos, but still not know how to do some basic due diligence and risk management?
Cryptos are the Wild West of finance. Treat everything you do in this realm as if there are no regulations or agencies that can protect your rights or your money. If your cash disappears en route to the bank, it's gone. If the bank gets robbed, your deposits are gone. If the bank owner disappears into the night, your deposits are gone. This is how it was for years and years, until the banks had regulations and oversight.
Instead of sending over $200k in 1 shot, break it up into tranches. $100, $500, $1000, $2,500, etc etc. You should have conducted this run in much smaller amounts until you knew all of the proper procedures.

No Credit cards or debit cards? Checks? Wires?
I get you don't need to use banks often, but I think it would be unwise to not even have a bank account. It's just an additional tool.
I don't get the hate towards banks. I've been using a big bank since middle school. Only fee I was ever charged was $25 for order drafting in high school. It was a great lesson that taught me to keep a closer eye on my finances.
