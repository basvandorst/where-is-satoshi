makes sense tbh.. just don't tell them i guess.. although it's probably a bad idea anyway.

my advice is don't.. use them for something else.

No. Just use cash deposit on localbitcoins. Prepaid cards are not helpful at all.

circle is the only place in the UK to buy BTC for GBP without paying some fees..  sometimes has offers &lt;4% over spot and doesn't always require ID verification (but a lot of sellers do and probably will ask for it on your first transaction).. you could also try bitbargain.co.uk, which usually doesn't require verification, but prices are higher. There are some other options..  is probably a good list, but basically all suffer from high fees, id verification or requiring a SWIFT bank transfer (no normal faster payments). tbh,the best option is probably to do the circle id verification and wait 3 or 4 days, but localbitcoins would probably be my next choice. If you plan to buy lots of BTC I would recommend a [fidor]( bank current account which will allow you to make cheap (£2.49) SEPA transfers to kraken.com, bitstamp.net and other EUR exchanges.

circle.com works with GBP (visa/mastercard) debit cards with no fees. A second option that works better with large amounts is to open a [fidorbank.uk]( current account and use that to send money to kraken.com (or bitstamp, zyado etc). They charge £2.49 per SEPA transfer and almost nothing on converting GBP to EUR. 
A note to coinbase - fidor doesn't work with you because there is no way to verify the fidor accounts as they (hilariously) still do not have their own IBAN information.. it would be good if you could fix that somehow.. although it is expected that they will have IBANs soon.
