I swear most of these people on here are trolls, if they really have doubt in the value of bitcoin they are shortsighted or haven't paid attention.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:29:24
of course how can you control thousands of people you dont know who have bitcoin, the mafia is a known entity and they are friends, obvious choice
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:23:22
just because i've had no desire to converse with a plethora of idiots on reddit, doesnt mean I'm not intelligent and informed
When should they buy, where is your crystal ball. 
They should obviously buy when it's low before it rises correct?
@_date: 2018-11-05 10:04:13
right, like cheese burgers and blowjobs
are you claiming that a national currency that can be manipulated by governments, is a better storage of assets
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:01:51
short term thinking
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:21:22
yea everyone is so pissed off , that would be your brainlet response, correct?
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:25:17
which ones, the dumb will be taken advantage of, elevate yourself it's so easy when everyone is dumber than you

obvious troll post, dumb fucks
I hope you don't buy, and regret it

if bitcoin is worth more than the dollar in such a scenario, it would be advantageous to use for many purposes.

yep fucking idiots who will get left in the dust, they are all beneath me already I pay them no mind

He was responding to a passive agressive idiotic shit post, are you an idiot too? wait don't answer I already know.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:57:18
yea different people have different ideas, like you, you dont realize you are conflating two separate groups of people. Which ones are the idiots? 
Surely you wouldnt be an idiot for holding onto a currency rapidly increasing in value, over a long period of time, with a finite supply. right?
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:44:11
it would be based on seeing a pattern of increasing value, that maybe  people of lower intelligence couldn't understand
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:34:02
obviously when it is rapidly increasing in value, like it has over the past few years, and when there is only a finite supply in the long run, it would make sense to hold onto it, but apparently you dont see a pattern
probably some brain damage

wtf are you talking about, you are the one defending banks gambling away peoples money
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:44:04
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:33:19
It isn't as complicated as you make it seem, large corporations gambling away the money of the common man is pretty simple to understand, good to know you're an apologist though.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:19:45
We made up the concept of money, we can pretend it is worth whatever we want it to be worth, collectively.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:52:04
And we collectively decide how much our time is worth, why is a Big Mac worth what it's worth, why is your wage worth what it is worth, we collectively decided that is what it's worth with our actions
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:13:47
ur a landmark
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:29:48
Physics are a bit more complicated than understanding how currency works, almost everyone has purchasing power, so they can understand how the dollar works, when people in large banks basically break the rules of what the common man can do with the dollar, then it is egregious. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:30:11
well, the whole argument for bitcoin is that it is a store of value, and the whole argument for soybeans and corn is that you eat them, that is their value
It becomes a problem when you can artificially inflate the value of something, that is considered a store of value, based on trading of counterfeit bitcoins

localbitcoins is probably still up
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:22:16
nope, paper bitcoins being traded inflate the supply of bitcoin and tank the price
pretty simple concept to understand, unless you're a dunce, like you are, fucktard

are you saying CME futures arent based in cash

@_date: 2018-12-15 17:01:22
The problem is people who manipulate the price without buying it, delegitimize your investment
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:42:29
you hope so, but as long as the financial institutions are in place, it's complicated
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:46:53
right, but using it for starbucks is throwing it away, due to the deflationary scale of bitcoin, telling people to buy starbucks with it is disingenuous at the current stage
It would help bitcoin, but it's morally fucked up
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:02:32
they affect the price of btc in dollars, which is the current important metric
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:51:01
maybe I am misusing the term, futures, but according to what I've read, the chicago trading exchange trades in paper bitcoins, which means they are inflating the supply of bitcoin massively, and tanking the price in the process
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:15:30
in reality, the volume is hugely inflated by the futures market in chicago being allowed to trade in fiat, without needing the actual bitcoins to trade, so that finite supply isnt really 21 million in reality when people are trading in paper and it is reflected in the price
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:12:29
right, bitcoin is moved, as in the value of bitcoin is moved, something that had a finite supply of 21 million, in reality is far above that based on the current futures trading, and the price is reflected by that
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:54:05
what if we get bots to google what is bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:22:18
Nobody with a brain wants to buy something worth so little like a coffee, with something worth so much like a bitcoin, it's idiotic.
This creates a situation where large corporations hoard all the bitcoins, sheer retardation.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:49:31
the problem is paper bitcoins are traded on the chicago exchange, making bitcoins, in theory, finite supply, no longer finite, and inflated like fiat
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:14:21
but cant futures traders buy an equivalent of 10 BTC to short the market, in dollars, without anyone having to buy bitcoins themselves, therefore taking no risk.
In this case, they artificially lower the bitcoin price, by simulating 10 bitcoins being sold or traded, without actually having to buy bitcoins, ruining the whole concept of limited supply, as they just pretended that they had the market value of bitcoins, without actually buying bitcoins
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:55:40
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:52:03
Chicago exchange is trading paper bitcoins as if they were real bitcoins, and inflating the amount of bitcoins in the market, therefore making the so called finite supply no longer finite
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:06:38
arent paper bitcoins being used in the Chicago trading futures, I recall reading about that.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:53:32
see, I'm such a genius I create new words
based on what i've read the chicago exchange trades paper bitcoins, that in itself is what is inflating the amount of bitcoin and in turn is tanking the price
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:18:45
the problem is they inflate the amount of bitcoins in circulation through this method, allowing them to manipulate the price, without even buying a bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:03:00
exactly, they arent directly buying the commodity, yet they are still manipulating the price of it
