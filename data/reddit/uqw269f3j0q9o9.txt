there are some bugs to be fixed, but here's the initial version:  
  
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:54:05
whose rule?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:38
I know what you meant, but doesn't mean much for someone buying higher than that. I hope you're right about the upward trajectory.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:52
Thank you so much! This kind of info is what I was looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:57:29
Did you manually place the letters to fit the mask, or is there some tool that does that for you? I'm familiar with Photoshop, but have never heard of such tool
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:34:06


Yeah, if you invest millions..
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:49:41
I'm having the exact same thoughts. I thought all these comments and the op's post would make things clear(er).. I mean, *futures* sounded like a fairly easy concept to grasp, but I'm really having trouble with making any sense of all this..
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:35:00
what do you mean by *neck line breaks ~$12500*? isn't the neck line around $17000? also, *all hell breaks lose* is a good thing, right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:02:53
This is the only film ever that I stopped watching after the first 10-20 minutes. Not that I haven't seen worse shit on TV, but this one I actually planned to watch and wanted to check out.

Thanks, will do it by the weekend.

or one tenth of a key every year, so they could use 10% of what he has left them, every year for 10 years ^^@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:49
holy shit, your comments are cringey as fuck.. you sound like a 19-year-old neckbeard
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:37:31
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:11:15
I cringe at comments like these...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:13
I, too, started off with coinbase, but would like to try gdax. The problem is that I don't understand all the options and don't know where to learn how to make use of them..
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:29:35
aren't limit orders without fees?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:38
hmm, didn't know that.. anyway, I'm sticking with coinbase for now
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:23
I know, but fees are lower (nonexistent?), as I've heard.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:06
hope you're right!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:50
Coinbase. I just connected my credit card and can buy BTCs instantly. That's the easiest way, but people complain about the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:20
no, who?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:03
i did that at 19.2k..
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:17:24
then ignore it
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:50:54
what's the key?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:34:04
Sure, but it sounded extra broad and general to produce any meaningful results. The Mac's *look it up* didn't give me correct results so I guessed I'd ask first.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:13:42


exactly why I think I'm not an idiot for hoping to get rich in this way
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:32:41
I started buying at around 9k, but the moment I decided to buy a more significant amount of bitcoin, the price went down and is staying there. Of course, I bought at 19.2k...
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:58
just don't think about it.. comments on this subreddit are often cringey as fuck, people throwing terms around like they're some old-school investors, but are probably in crypto for a month
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:03
You know what, I'm just refusing to sell with a loss. I had this gut feeling that BTC will fuck me over just because I was cursed or some shit, and it's actually happening, but I refuse to succumb and will wait as long as it takes to get positive returns on this fucker.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:52
doesn't matter
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:26
Who are we? I'm down 30%. And I'm not complaining to anyone, but I sure am allowed to be pissed.  
Anyway, I'm not selling bellow 25k/btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:54


never heard of this advice here, care to explain?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:21:45
it depends on which one of us is more cursed
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:38:34
You serious? Of course you can..
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:28
19.2k here, I'm not giving up, ever
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:56:02
I'll do it if you find the titles
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:58
I have to deposit money somehow... can't do it with cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:29
I bought at 19k a significant amount, but something that I was okay with losing. Still, I am anxious because the moment I put in a more significant amount of money than before (I started at 9k), the price dips like 30%..  
I won't sell before getting at least 50% returns and am willing to wait for as long as I need to, but I think I can be anxious and pissed off by this happening. If I invested all that I invested the first time I invested, I would still be in great plus.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:10:36
what is CME?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:49:14
you see, I didn't even know *futures* is used in context like *futures trading* so it wasn't that obvious what I should google.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:48
could you please explain what *futures* are? please? I've been seeing it around a lot lately
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:04:45
what are futures? what is futures opening?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:30:52


But I'm not selling. Or maybe you're talking about people that are in the same situation as me, but chose to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:13
yeah, it was sarcasm. literally every second comment contains that profound advice
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:32:53
Why? I'd rather gamble to lose all that I invested if there's a chance I'll win in the end, than selling with a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:36:31
thanks, but I've already transferred to bitfinex

Hindsight is 20 /20
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:00:10


If someone really possessed the knowledge you're talking about, that someone wouldn't miss a thing, let alone google. And what the fuck do you know about to say this? Like valuing an asset takes skill and genius like no other task.
@_date: 2018-05-03 12:02:13
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:52:09
no, street
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:33:40


Why so high, why not at $1?
Anyway, the point was that avoiding the ATH could make you miss the future gains by waiting for the price to drop. Not always, but it happens.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:43:01
but if the crash doesn't happen..? anyway, we could go on about this for long, but I don't feel like it so I'm out, bye
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:13:00
but you are not Wright
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:28:45
So, you wouldn't have bought at 3k, right? And you'd miss so much.
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:11:10
well, you kind of started the trigger train
@_date: 2019-12-22 18:21:01
No, but rather the black void that makes more thant 50% of the image's area. That's why the fuck.
@_date: 2019-12-22 18:06:03
Was it so hard to crop the screenshot? iPhone literally lets you edit/crop it immediately after taking it..
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:51:51
what the fuck
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:39:47
no, 10
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:54:46
Wow, nothing goes past you..

dysgraphic, not dyslexic
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:54:59
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:44:26
so? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:26:43
I can still see that reply.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:05:35
you know how to divide numbers, good for you  
anyway, that wasn't his point, his point could've easily be made by using $266 and $133. there are more people involved, the bitcoin's price can't rise that fast any more with the presence of so many other better altcoins.. it's just not the same
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:24:34
I guess it depends on what you consider selling. I didn't sell my bitcoins for dollars, I sold (exchanged) them for other cryptocurrencies which haven't suffered such a drop as bitcoin did.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:52:09
why not? you could easily get the same men hours by just extending the deadline.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:55:54
1x1 here, I love the Morse's Aventures 2
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:18:44
yes (as opposed to being $50k down), but I think a better perspective would be saying I'm about 10% down, and I'm really not worried at all being down only 10% after entering the market just before the shitstorm. and I'm really confident about my investment so I see no chance in being at loss a month from now
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:44:45
I know this is good for recognition and adoption, but honestly whenever I see one of those the first thought that crosses my mind is *scam* and high fees.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:13:39
Perspective really is weird. Me listening to an American talking about how they don't have access to some cool shit is very rare. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:28:44
i'm not and it's not 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:49:25
If I hadn't "panic sold" I'd be more than $50k in debt. But since I did sell and traded for other coins, at one point I had about $40k in gains. After the latest dip I'm now at -$10k for which I'm pretty sure will disappear and turn to gains very soon.  
If I held on BTC, I'd have to wait for it to reach at least $20k to see any gains at all.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:18:16
hm, no
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:28:14


You may be a coach, but you’re wrong. His statement is only partially true because it’s not ONLY DIET that will make those kind of abs. Yes, the diet is a big part of it, but you’re abs wouldn’t be buldging out like that even with 0% fat. 


Nobody’s arguing that. But what they are arguing is that training abs actually makes them bigger, which doesn’t contradict the “abs are made in kitchen” mantra that everybody likes to repeat like they’re clever.  
Also, doing thousands of sit ups a day would probably make a nice deficit.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:32:07
No amount of fat lost will give you bulging muscles like that bro.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:33:25
The op didn’t deny your statement either
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:31:33
ONLY diet? You say my muscles will magicaly start bulging like that when I lose the remaining few millimeters of fat?
