What you are pointing out is the broken window fallacy by Frederic Bastiat and you are correct. If you where incorrect then breaking windows would be a valid way to stimulate the economy.

Well since DuckDuckGo is worth about 30-40 million dollars, yeah I wish I had the talent to make a google competitor. People like you think you need to beat the top dog, you just need to take enough customers to be profitable.

Because I believe healthy competition can be achieved in an emerging market? You know when the Internet was as young as bitcoin the dominant search engine was Ask right?

Oh yeah sorry, there is nothing you could possibly offer that localbitcoins doesn't. Bitcoins full potential has been tapped out. /s

Cant you just meet someone and exchange cash for bitcoins?

Thanks! I see a lot of bitcoin haters. It seems a little weird to me being new to it. Why hate it? Its not like its shoved down anyones throat. Don't like it then ignore it.

How is making a competitor wasting his time for a community that values decentralization, which is also an emerging market?

So I am looking at satoshi mines... How does this game make money? It looks so easily exploitable.
