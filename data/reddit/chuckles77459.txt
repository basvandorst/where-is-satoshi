Do I need to do something before people can change tip me? I'm familiar with Btc and have some, just not this tipper bot.

Yes, I know you can generate additional addresses. So in this case it would be safe to share one of these addresses?

Will at allow twitch.tv tips?
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:40:10
Well I mean I figure it's just as secure as mobile banking ect right? (From a hackers standpoint, not from the standpoint of the company itself)

Thanks! I'm hoping to one day make a living off streaming (:

Can I get a 3,000,000 tip.... :D
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:24:09
I haven't actually held coins in a desktop wallet since a long time ago, as fair as I know wallets (such as coinbase) only have the 1 address. Is this a public address? 
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:15:57
Well I have my stream schedule listed. I guess I can take it down and repost when I'm on?

Am I supposed to send them back again? I don't know this etiquette &gt;..&lt; 
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:32:40
50 bits. Thanks for the tutorial, practicing sending now so have them back. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:52:26
Okay. Thank you very much for a solid answer. I'm just a broke teenager with only a few hundred bucks in BTC so I don't think I have to worry about that. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:50:58
You're missing what I'm asking. I understand the websites could be hacked ect ect, but all I'm asking is that, seeing that there's only a couple hundred bucks worth of BTC in my wallet, does posting my coinbase address make me any more vulnerable than not posting it? 
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:16:31
I don't understand why this didn't tip but I am sad because I thought a massive tip :(
Edit: Spelling, idek how I failed that hard.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:36:27
Welp I understand why everyone says the BTC community is a bunch of toxic assholes
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:27:19
