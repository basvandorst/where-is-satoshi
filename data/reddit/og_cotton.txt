I'd probably be driving the BMW I want to, and I'd be able to go to college for what I wanted to study.

I was a freshman around when coin was cheap and I wanted to invest a bit but no one would listen to me. Now I'm broke and an adult but 14 year old me had the right idea.

Or when the price fluctuates so much that it ends up costing more to use btc than cash.

So basically the company fucked up editing the genetics of the plant to make it not grow more than once, then sued people who didn't have control over fucking wind?? What a shit company lol

I'm pretty sure Montero was basically saying that they own the seeds farmer use to grow and that farmers can't plant seeds from their crop because the company owns the seed. 
Weed industry is going to be interesting to see how it develops. I personally don't see why someone has to buy a seed multiple times if the plant produces seeds that can be planted.

Fuck it I plan on a minimum 2 year hold might as well just start buying, hoping it dips a little more though. Every time I want some bud I'm just going to buy bitcoin instead and hold. I knew about bitcoin when it was under 100$ a coin and regret not being able to invest then, but no reason to hold off any longer.

Breathable air is free still, but I can't think of anything else.

People here like to forget that. I don't understand enough to really get into it, but bitcoin largely seems to be viewed as an investment rather than using it as a currency. The price fluctuations can make you money if you do it right, so I don't really see an issue with making money in fiat rather than coin, if that's what the person wants to do.

Why not hold half and invest half? Less roi but there's also a safety net. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:18:17
Free will? That's free ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 
Relevant to btc now, I think the fees need to be lower, but I understand they have to exist. A fee of 2$ isn't much to most Americans, but in Venezuela or another country using btc in the middle of a shit storm high fees are detrimental. If fees keep increasing I fear it will impact btc.

So buying Monday would be a good idea? That was my plan.

ViaBTC is the only way I've used. I don't know how to answer your other questions or I would help. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:09:20
