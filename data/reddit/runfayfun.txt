How often have things that increase in value 1500% in 1.5 years, stuck around?
I would not take that bet because, as could be inferred from my post, I'm not in the market to take excessive risks with my money on investing fads, so I'm not going to throw money at an investing fad or on a derivative bet.
If it triples, or quadruples by next Christmas, or if it collapses, I'm not going to regret my decision not to bet you, or to invest in BTC, because it's a very risky investment, and that's not my game.

I hope they didn't buy it after it rose. It's really sad to see how many people are buying it now that it's already inflated. I have to imagine even though BTC is projected to be opening up on more traditional investing channels, people will be smart enough to stay away. This is another one of those "greater fools" deals. Eventually, there will be no more people left to buy a cryptocurrency that clearly has an upper limit on its value (the real energy required to mine).
If you thought BTC were going to keep being a reliable gainer and continue to have investors, a smarter buy long-term would be energy fund, IMO.

But investing with the goal of maximal and safe return has to be inherently blind to the suffering of others. Once you bring suffering and altruism and "the right thing" into the equation you're no longer investing for maximal return, you're willingly participating in wealth redistribution, which I agree with, but to the OP's point, the returns on charitable giving from an investment standpoint are zero unless you're using the charity to manipulate money out of the system unethically.
