It really depends if you feel BTC will reach 100k. If you really think it will, it’s currently at 8-9% of that value. under those terms, it’s still cheap... depends how bullish you are. If you’re not then don’t invest.

With a captive audience in the billions? Unlikely

Best we can hope for is the massive exposure of crypto to billions of people to trickle down/up to BTC and cause mega fomo. To start with I think it will be a completely closed platform, no transfer to exchanges. 
I also doubt fb coin will stay completely closed forever. If crypto matures and becomes more regulated (as it is every day) then I can see the two things co-existing and maybe even exchange between currency opening up. It’s at that point we start to see crypto taking over for day to day payments - not because of fb coin but because it has matured enough too. Fb will help legitimise to some extent - unless they screw it up.
From a purist perspective it’s awful as this is Frankenstein.. From a general media exposure and introduction for the masses I think it’s positive, I can’t see how btc won’t benefit from at least the trickle down effect short term and maybe direct interaction long term.

Erm or because they are launching exchanges faster than anyone, innovating, releasing on time. It is the biggest exchange, BNB coin is the base coin of the biggest exchange in the world (and rapidly growing). Volume for BNB is sure even in a bear market.
Your post is a completely unfounded wild conspiracy theory when the answer is staring you right in the face. BNB is the first coin tied to a massively successful and rapidly growing, real business where most other coins are white papers and roadmaps. This is why it can break from BTC while the rest of the market follows and will continue to do so.

Terrible idea

I’d move it all to BNB. I don’t see how it won’t increase dramatically when margin trading goes general availability. 
Unlike most coins they have a real business and deliver consistently - not to mention they are selling the shovels in a gold rush.

Thanks, makes sense.
From what I have read Chinese law is deliberately a bit grey with things like this, enabling the state to really decide what they want to enforce or not.
I think eventually China will have to open up to it again, even if it’s just Bitcoin as a common digital asset (at which point they will make sure they have a lot of it).

Isn’t trading illegal though? Meaning if someone just gives you a bitcoin for free, simply owning it is not illegal however trading it for a price is.
