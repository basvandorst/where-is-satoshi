Public shaming absolutely works! 
Was the only way I could get AT&amp;T to refund the $500 they stole from me was to put it up on Twitter. They replied immediately and resolved it.

I use US bank. No issues. Yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:11:03
I haven’t contacted Us bank yet but there’s a $4 “international processing fee” apparently in addition to all Coinbase fees. I’m not 100% sure that they’re related but I haven’t noticed that fee before

I can’t help you, except to say I haven’t had any issues except the fees and huge international processing fee from my bank (Usbank) when I use my debit card.

Funny thing is: I also need $30 in bitcorns. Anyone know how I can also receive some?

I have no real idea but I would imagine it matters where you sell it not where/when you got it. Sorry I can’t give you an exact answer. I’m sorta looking for solid tax advise as well. Looking to start day trading.

I totally understand about not being tech-y and it’s tough for me to understand also. I bought a Ledger Nano-s to store crypto. You can store much more than just bitcoin on it but I’m an idiot and never even set it up. Not so easy for me to understand but between the nano s and the Trezor hardware Wallets, I understand they’re the 2 safest ways to store crypto. Also Google MEW, my ether wallet ����
