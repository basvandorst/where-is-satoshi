Uhm, who could possibly care about sending that little money anyway? I see what you mean, like a pay per second / minute thing where the actual cost is really low (below a cent) but could vary between artists and products.
But you can do that right now as well, by just recording the total in the background as a number and simply withdrawing as soon as the amount becomes &gt; 1 cent.
Once again Bitcoin delivers an insanely overdesigned solution to a maybe not even existing problem.

I don't see Bitcoin doing anything that is of any value to me or the average consumer.
Bitcoin comes attached with a tremendous amount of absolutely wasted energy and resources.
Scalability is a gigantic problem and the proposed solution is either completely unpractical on an individual basis, or leads to centralization.
Users of Bitcoin don't actually use it as a currency but as an investment or stock. Only Bitcoin has absolutely no application or value besides being used as a currency.
Regular fiat currencies are backed by countries, Bitcoin is backed by its users. That's inherently risky as people are fickle.
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:50:28
That's not really true. If it provides a tangible benefits people will slowly adopt it, as more people adopt it growth grows exponentially.
However, with bitcoin, we've seen people adopting it, and stopping to use it. Most likely because the uses for BitCoin in day to day life are minuscule. It doesn't solve a real problem for most people.

What I said from the very start is, that somebody could make a Cryptocurrency like product, solving the current problems while delivering better usability.
That somebody/or group of people wouldn't need to go through the messy process of implementing their changes on to bitcoin. They could just make a "BetterCoin". People would switch to that product / adopt that product (because let's be real, adoption is still very very very small).
So to counter the headline and article. No, people should not stop building a better bitcoin.
I can not make it any clearer than this.

We need only 12 Bitcoin to fund this! Support us, it's only 13 Bitcoin to get this going. For only 15 Bitcoin you too can be part of the future!

How am I save though? If the government went rogue my money being "safe" is one aspect, the other one is my body. That's a much more important aspect. If the government starts stealing my money from my bank I think we have a lot of problems that can not be solved by simply refusing to tell them my Bitcoin password.


I didn't need permission to open my last bank account (who would I even ask?) and my bank, in fact, paid me to open it. I got 150€ for free.


Dangerous game, storing value in an asset that loses and gains so much value over a single year.


Not backing happens very rarely for us here in the developed world where bitcoin actually matters and inflation is a good thing. A currency that keeps gaining value is inherently bad for the economy. I've argued this before on here but people really don't seem to grasp that concept, I suppose you don't either.
I think it's interesting that I don't put faith in people upholding the value of Bitcoin, a technology which could easily be replaced by a similar but better product and one that doesn't waste so many resources just to process a few transactions. (to be fair, folded in those few transactions per block could be thousands hidden in the LN, but still)
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:27:49
Wrong. Bitcoin is based on a blockchain/ledger system. Improvements and changes could be made to that. I used those examples, not as direct analogies, but to show that big established brands can be surpassed by superior upstarts.
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:00:29
Okay should I just repeat my Myspace/Digg/Horse/VHS/Harddrive/Steam/Electricity...... example?
If new technology is strong enough it will be adopted. Just because bitcoin could incorporate those changes, doesn't mean it will. Or if it will incorporate those changes that doesn't mean it will do so fast enough. Blackberry anyone?
It boggles my mind anyone, literally anyone, could think that just because bitcoin is 'established' in this very small club that that means anything. Much larger market shifts have happened before and will happen again.
Whatever attracts the most users will win.
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:50:27


that whole sentence reads like somebody explaining what a round corner is.
Improvements can either be made to the blockchain tech directly, it could be replaced with something totally different, solving the same problems or you could use the underlying technology and put a different application on top. 
do you think bitcoin = blockchain? do you think everything using a blockchain system is basically bitcoin? lmao
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:32:12
Yes, stop trying to fix the horse, we have the horse and that is it. Let's never improve upon existing technology.
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:36:42


Internet Explorer is still the dominant technology today. Isn't it?
Like how fucking dumb are people on this sub? I'm not making the argument that EVERY technology is ALWAYS getting replaced ALL the time. Just that established technologies or platforms do get replaced when something better comes along.


And that's why we still use VHS today, isn't it. ISN'T IT? 
You just used an example, that shows how wrong you are. Like, do you understand that you just defeated yourself.

That's the great thing, you don't need to. There's already a super efficient working tested and secure system in place that handles transactions. 
Again, why would anyone EVER do it like you are suggesting it? Why would they deduct money for every single request instead of gathering requests and asking for the total cost at the end of the month?
I think you have your head up in the clouds. Imagination is nice and good, go and write a book friend. Write a cool scifi novel and try to think of a convincing reason why people would possibly want everything to be decentralized with transactions for every single data request.
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:34:31


It does not produce value. All it does is validate transactions in an insanely and every growing inefficient manner. It is literally wasted energy. Our transaction system at work handles transactions and does so without wasting computational power by being efficient. Bitcoin is the direct opposite of efficient.


I'm 30 and 100 years ago is not recent lol. That is a long time ago, the whole world is different. Drawing direct comparisons without considering the context is hilariously stupid.
Didn't the USA get rid of the deficit under Obama? The EU has specific rules for debt and deficit just because of this risk too. Countries taking on debt also isn't the same as a private person taking on debt.
My state is smarter because everyone hates hyperinflation and we've learned from the past. We are smarter than we've ever been.

Bitcoin also lost an insane amount of value from last year to this year and it doesn't look like it's recovering so?
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:45:53
Because they lack a clear use case. As soon as one of them solves an actual problem or provides a service people really enjoy using. That's when it's gonna take off.

The total ignorance of your comment baffles me. bitcoin is bitcoin, it's the whole package. somebody could change any aspect of it, add to any aspect, add totally new things and that 'product' would not be bitcoin.
that's like saying "you don't get it man, windows is a binary, there's no point in having anything but windows because windows IS A BINARY' like it's gibberish what you are saying is gibberish

@_date: 2019-01-19 14:22:07
Of course, you are right, if people don't know about something how could they use it? That's why when you have something really good, you go and tell people about it. Over time the stuff that actually works will rise to the top.
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:58:14
Ah, so you aren't "saving", but investing(gambling) then? 
Because you see, you 'save' every month. Not just those where bitcoin goes up.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:30:00
quite recently....like when? After WW1? Are you a mad lad?


Inflation is good if you want people to spend their money on goods, services and actual investments that actually produce something.


I love that you say "gambling on the stock market" as if investing into Bitcoin is any less gambling. As if Bitcoin is a 100% sure thing that will totally catch on in a mainstream way any day now.


My plan is to invest my money into something where I can understand how it would produce actual value. 
For example, right now in my country temperatures are rising every summer. Up until 10/20 years ago we didn't have this problem and our summers were fairly cool. Now with the insane heat more and more climate machine installation services have cropped up and I've invested into THAT. There's a market for it, there's a solution for it that works. Boom, an actual fucking investment with real-world benefits.
Now if I didn't want to do that, I could just choose one of the many products that combine different stocks and markets into a big bundle and guarantee a certain return per year. That beats inflation and produces extra income. It can guarantee those returns because they are insured, so unless the whole fucking system collapses (at that point we have a lot of problems anyway) I'm set and I don't need to worry that I'm investing into a 'currency' that could lose 80% of its value in a year. TEN years after it was started.
I love tech, I'm a Programmer/DBA by trade but I do not see the value in BitCoin, especially with this stupid "Prove of Work" system that literally wastes so much energy. It' an extremely inefficient system.
Maybe there's gonna come a coin that does decentralization, anonymity, scalability with a low energy requirement. At that point I'm gonna jump in, but only if there is the possibility of endlessly increasing the supply. Inflation is vital for a currency to do its job. The idea that the safest and best investment you can make is to just hold on to your money is poison to the economy.

You just invented a problem that literally does not exist. It LITERALLY does not exist. Businesses don't just start providing services on the hopes that the client can pay. If the investment is life threatening there is collateral, there is insurance in case of one business losing solvency.

The only viable way to use LN is to make your exchange of choice your BitCoin bank. You deposit money with your bank, your bank has a large lightning network with all the commercial enterprises you want to do business with, and they transfer money when you tell them to.

Yey, now we only need to raise capital (producing carbon) to build the panels (producing carbon). After that, we buy the land to place the panels in (producing carbon).
Now we only need to pay for maintenance and replacements (producing carbon) to run Bitcoin.
Obviously at night there's no sun so we need to use other sources of electricity (producing carbon) or we buy batteries to save up electricity to use at night (producing carbon). EASY.
(oh we also need the hardware to verify blocks, that hardware also produces carbon when built and needs maintenance and replacements of course...but besides that super negligible)

More likely is that they are going to charge you for the ease of use, comfort and plain usability of bitcoin.
Exchange controlled lightning network seems to be the only way the average user is gonna get some practical use out of bitcoin.
