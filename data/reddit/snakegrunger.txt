If he sold drugs to an american citizen, or if he conspired to facilitate/enable the sale of illegal narcotics on US soil, then the crime enters US jurisdiction.

Probably to prevent abuse and subsequently crashing the website in the case of a panic-sale.

They have two bitcoin stratum servers, and one of them was offline for a little while.

He might end up kidnapped and robbed of his private keys since he almost all mined by himself for most of the first year of Bitcoin's existence since the genesis block, I think that might be the worst case scenario.

Isn't Alex Green's real name Ryan Kennedy ?

My guess is they went with very complex technology (60nm transistors versus ASICminer's and Avalon's 120nm (antique) technology, don't remember 100% the numbers, but it's very close to those)), thinking they could cram more hashing power that consumes less watts in a small box, and they had a ton of trouble because they might not have known what the hell they were doing, unlike Avalon's founders that were initally involved in producing tablet electronic components. They thought they could overcome any challenge with all the money they collected from preorders, but experience is stronger than just a pile of cash.

You gotta be kidding. BFL acts all nice on the outside, posting on their little forum, their little twitter account, but realistically speaking, they started shipping (ONE YEAR+ LATER) only in tiny doses, units are appearing, as for the 50/60GH/s units, if you ordered in summer 2012 you would *maybe* have one today, but anyone after that will be lucky if they get them in 2013 as things are going.
So what does that mean? It means, BFL got millions of dollars from customers, and being so late in shipping, your unit will most likely not produce return on investment. The only true winners are BFL themselves and a select tiny few who ordered in summer 2012.

If you read these Skype conversations about "Benny" putting most of _TerraHash_'s money up front to build ASIC, I can bet you Benny got his hardware...

Switch to eligi.us , zero% fee :P (but you have to wait for 120 blocks for your mined share to appear in your wallet), or BitParking for merged mining and low DGM fees.

That's nothing, another company will be adding 2,000TH to the existing 600-800 in december... So yes it will keep going up and up and up and up some more.
edit: company is cointerra if I'm not mistaken.

Well the -one- thing about PayPal, is that they are greedy as hell and they have an ultimate decision making power over your funds and have the authority to freeze your assets with them at any time, indefinitaly, that is the reason PayPal is not popular outside of online merchants and eBay.

Few dollars at the most.
