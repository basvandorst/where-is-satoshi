actually, thats the website that originally got me excited about QR code "art" - I have every intention of adding that and more ( think animated looping halftone ) anyways, first thing first, test the waters with the current art selection and see if the demand for the product is even there. lets face it, I wont spend time developing a site if no one wants it

*bows* kinda hacked it together and dont wanna spend too much time making it better if I find out it wont be worth it. I figure it is good enough to call a beta and get a feel for the response....however Im having a super hard time figuring out this social networking thing....help me lol?
EDIT - OOOOOh, i see what happened here, you werent talking to me lol :[ I agree, his QR is cool....but QRgif.com is a generator. anyone can have a custom animated QR code easy peasy. apples and oranges

sure...thanks for the feedback. Its a beta website, built it myself for the past 2 weeks. Decided that free with branding was a good idea and for $1 (in paypal or bitcoin) you could have a completely branding free QR code.
Other things I want to do is get the page to show previews and to add more designs.
Just launched yesterday, give it a shot, keep the feedback coming. Im listening
