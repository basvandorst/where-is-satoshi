How is the Bitcoin/Crypto community in Cambodia? Cool to see my homeland in a post.

If I received bitcoin from selling something and sent it to Coinbase to cash out. How do I or Coinbase know how much taxes I’m to pay?

I’m interested in gifting bitcoin as well; however, are there going to be any issues in the long run, when our friends and family decide to cash out? Who pays the taxes on that? I don’t want a huge tax burden at the end of the day. Say that $50 worth in BTC becomes $1000 or even more.

Still on track.

Can you provide any services from where you are and earn BTC? That might be a viable option. Good luck and best wishes.

Question for you, friend. How popular is crypto-currency over there? Is it slowly being adopted? Is it criticized a lot by people in your community?
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:57:04
Haha this is awesome. We have life!!

I've been using Green wallet. So far it's been a great experience. Samurai wallet is a great option as well.
