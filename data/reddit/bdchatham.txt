I hope this was sarcasm....
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:51:18
Pretty disagreeable. Several altcoins have better scaling solutions and in some cases, better/more diverse real-world applications. I think it’s best to invest in several coins that you have done research on 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:56:23
LN is still pretty debatable of whether it will have the benefit to bitcoin it claims. I’m not against bitcoin, but it’s fair to be skeptical 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:19:15
I used to be diehard btc, but some alt coins really do have some strong tech. I want to get back into btc, but I want to make sure I’m patient and not doing it cuz “oh no it’s spiking! I don’t want to miss the rebound.” I’ll have to take a look at ADA though. I am really impressed by IOTA, I think it’s a very long hold but the applications it has with potential AI micro transactions is really cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:03:59
Stagger your sell orders...?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:01:31
I'll take a look!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:25:56
I respectfully disagree about 15k. Times seem rough rn I agree, but I swear every time I think this thing is going to sink 5k it sinks 2 then blows up lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:50:35
Also take this time to learn more about the tech, it wi solidify your belief in the investment even more. That’s what really did it for me 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:38
Got it. I’ll keep an eye on it! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:52:17
Lol then sell your btc...? Sounds like you have made your mind up. Best of luck either way
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:17:17
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:00:32
Gotcha, thank you for the response. I did some research more on it and understand the process more. I was just a bit stressed in the moment and thought to reach out to you guys because I knew someone would know better than me. 
My transaction is now "unspent" what exactly does that mean if you don't mind explaining. The explanation I found online was pretty vague. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:59:50
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:48
He’s saying don’t sell 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:00
What’s on the 18th? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:40:42
All I have seen is your price go down today. Cute. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:01:41
Agreed. I like your attitude. HODL incoming 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:24
Not sure what your point is by this?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:18:16
My ledger nano s says the transfer has 63 confirmations. That is even more confusing to me.
Also, thank you for taking the time to explain this stuff. It really helps - especially in times of high stress like this... only takes 1 mess up to lose a lot of money btc :/
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:22:22
Lol you sound like me a week ago. I’m in no way blindly following bitcoin. All of these coins that are coming up will have to face all of these same scaling issues bitcoin faces. It’s not like that have some magical solution. Some have no plan to solve it, and most are simply not nearly as healthy implementations. Yes, bitcoin is clogged to shit right now, but give it a month or two and segwit will be more widely used and that will take a huge load off of the issues we see now. Furthermore, LN is going to change things drastically hopefully within the next 6-12 months. You seem worried about other coins. Sure, they exist, but bitcoin has miles of a head start in this marathon. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:07:57
Made me lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:49:40
Just be patient. Bitcoin has a ton of energy behind it from the past few months. From the couple times I’ve lost faith and learned my lesson by losing fractions of my btc, just hodl. You will be happy you did 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:39:32
Well... that’s very bleak 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:42
More effective...? They all face these same scaling problems lol no one is changing to a more effective coin. People are following money and greed. Eventually bitcoin will scale with segwit and LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:59:11
Lol respect for that. I am a software dev and truly believe in the tech. Sure, maybe BTC won't be the golden child that relinquishes society of any hold banks have on the monetary system, but I hope a good coin, with good developers does. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:58:13
lol redditor for 4 days....
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:57:44
Sheesh, you people are all the same. You have these eery one-liners that you think are so profound and powerful while you act like a cult following some greedy moron... Get over whatever weird complex you have.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:44
Stop worrying about making a quick buck.. you have your money on the right horse. The only way you would have made money off alts spiking is guessing. Just chill out and wait for the obvious rebound 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:40
Gotcha, thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:03:39
Just a red flag to me anytime someone says pretty much anything good about bcash and has a short reddit existence. No offense to you
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:25:01
Well, the scary thing is those other coins might be able to dethrone bitcoin by then. That’s a ton of time! But I agree, from what I’ve read, LN will basically make btc ready for mass adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:51
Lol Im still holding. Enjoy whatever short term gain you get from your short-sighted implementations while they last 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:49:26
Ahhh I see. I guess my mistake is not entirely understanding the technology of these coins. I have a good understanding of btc and I have a technical background so I have a reasonable grasp of the roadmap. I hadn’t don’t a whole lot of research on other coins scalability though. I had essentially assumed they were more well equipped because they could maybe learn from design mistakes of btc. I kind of just assumed a coin like ltc was more well equipped to tackle these issues because of the general ideas I’ve seen on this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:52
Ah, I knew that was coming but didn’t know the date 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:50:00
If you believe in cryptocurrencies having the potential to change the world in the next few years, there is no reason to panic over this. BCH is clearly not able to scale and backed by people who throw worse public temper tantrums than my 3 year old niece. From a very technical perspective, I believe the best coin will survive. Lastly, I'm not going to live or die by a couple grand lol this isn't wallstreetbets. This shitstorm of drama will blow over. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:30
Okay, now it is marked as spent.... I'm worried :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:20
For the first time ever I’m glad to be on teemos side 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:09
You're extremely narrow-minded if you don't think this thing is making progress towards becoming a currency..
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:10:18
Bold move cotton, we’ll see if it pays off for him 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:47
Talk to you then ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:44:11
Name recognition is the only differentiation...? Lol do you have any ability to do any sort of critical thinking? These are two very different technologies with very different developers backing them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:44:35
I guess I’m not exactly sure what you mean by that statement. You mean, you think my perception of btc’s future maybe a bit bleak because of that timeline is crazy? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:26:41
haha talk to you later, clown.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:22:05
Lol turn bearish? You mean people do exactly what they did last week for the other futures and it goes up 2k? Ya, ok 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:21:37
Lol so what research have you done to learn about the counter-argument? Clearly, none. Segwit is already implemented by btc and if it were supported by wallets and exchanges right now, we wouldn't even be talking. Not to mention the fact that LN is coming within the next 6-12 months which allows for nearly instantaneous transactions. Dear lord, man/women... Do some critical thinking for two seconds before you start trying to bash on something you clearly know almost nothing about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:59:58
Sadly a good point 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:52
Everyone understands independent events... People can still believe a common thread may be BTC recovering. Hu-ho, what a crazy thought.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:22:49
If you’re mocking me: lol it’s going up. If you’re just being a goof: ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:06:50
Hehehe hohoho hehehe ur like, pretty brilliant m8
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:09:02
I completely understand. I too try to maximize my money. My best advice it to tell you to look at some charts, read into what makes bitcoins technology amazing, and invest only in small chunks as you learn! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:12:21
It is pretty predictable when raching thousand dollar milestones with btc if you ask me. Once it breaks, more than say $50, it'll probably jump a few hundred. It's all mental in investors' minds.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:50:26
Chill out...? Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:07:23
Not true. They have a security policy
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:38:38
Bitcoin wood
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:22
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:48:57
First off, you are just guessing numbers right now. Second, if you knew these numbers so definitively, why are you asking if you could clearly sell off and get more bitcoin back? Lastly, and most importantly, do your own critical thinking and have the guts to pull the trigger if you really believe in what you think is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:20:23
Just means it is overvalued, it will have a pullback to somewhere slightly lower, then ideally continue to prove it is indeed actually worth the price it pulled back from 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:58:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:46:55
Well, here’s the thing. Are you considering bitcoin as a long term investment or short term? 
Also, do some reading. Try to understand the technology behind it. Then you will see how powerful it is. This is what drives a lot of my investment into it. I’m a nerd and I see just how cool it is. 
To piggy-back off my first point, if you are considering this a long investment, this thing has huge growth potential. We’re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars if it really does approach its market cap 10-30 years down the road. Then, you won’t care about the couple hundred dollars you saved or lost when you bought your first coin (or parts of a coin). Basically, the ceiling is what you care about, not the few dollars you saved because you guessed when the price would dip a $100. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:40:10
Are you familiar with investing at all? Some think there is a huge correction coming. I personally don’t think bitcoin followers will let it fall below 10k. It may be a little before we get much higher - consider it a short pause. But it will continue to grow. It’s still in its infancy. If you put money in now, it will almost certainly grow. So no, you’re not too late! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:09
Unsure, I’d have to look into it. I have my coins on Coinbase. But only for convenience when the split hits and I want to sell my b2x. Then I’ll prob take the step to moving my coins to a hard wallet
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:50:45
First off, really appreciate such a thoughtful response. I'm technical, a software dev by schooling, but this whole space is so new to me that really any bit of information I can get from those more experienced is extremely helpful. I may just pull my money out of the market entirely as the money I am reliant on the money I currently have in btc to not drop horrifically, but I do plan to renter the market once I feel I have enough understanding to make an educated choice of currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:14:32
Why are you switching to litecoin? I'm a crypto noob and lurking to learn as much as I can. This upcoming split seems strange and I have my money on Coinbase so I'm quickly learning I should get it off there. Anyways, curious to hear your reasoning behind litecoin 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:45:48
Hmmm interesting. That’s more straightforward than I expected. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:19:08
Lol mmmmm ya 
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:07:44
Hi there, follow up question! I’m aware that if I send my money from Coinbase to some wallet address, then I’m free of Coinbase potentially being delayed. But at that point, where will my segwit2x free money be? I have no interest in it other than it being free money. But will it just appear it my wallet as another balance? Or do I have to somehow claim it from a different address? I understand the idea, just a bit confused on the process of how it will exactly go down and I’m pretty knew to the crypto market as a whole so I can’t say I’m extremely experienced. 
Thanks for any insight you share in advance :)
