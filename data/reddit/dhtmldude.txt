Oh baby....!
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:38:21
Holy fuck.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:03:12
I dunno.  I haven't been anywhere in years and I've never traveled cross country or little less out of province.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:54:14
Same here.  Other than real estate or passive income there is(nt) no better investment, or is(nt) there?
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:12:07
Thanks for reaching out.  Hope to see you again next time.

Amish.  Lol

These are the best explanations I have read so far.  Well designed.  
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:43:52
Panic sell or hold
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:39:45
Why why why 
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:07:11
Or maybe the car was overvalued when bought. ;) ;)
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:14:02

Fuck yeah
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:28:18
I shorted as well, huge mistake 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:13:37
I dunno.  I started with  usd in 2014.  Lost it all.  Reinvested $500 worth, and walked out with over $1000.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:41:56
I don't think so.  Makers have surged by 50 percent in blockchsin and coincidentally safer holdings have also increased.  I noticed this the other day.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:35:22
Mutual funds surged. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:34:02
I just found it funny that common hodlings went up by 5k just as bitcoin surged, specially since there is nothing happening in the markets and Trump is in presidency.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:34:52
By investing i mean mutual funds.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:25:43
Me too
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:02:05
The title indicates that bitcoin crashed.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:03:26
I hear the call....
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:16:01
Yup.  Pretty much.  I survived that slump but the one I'm in is worse now.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:14:45
The title of this post is highly controversial and fear invoking.

Durham police.  Holy.  Isnt that in Ontario near Toronto.  Jesus.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:17:24
It's true.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:36:05
Elaborate for me.
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:19:58
The monetary system is a state machine.  It keeps the state of currency and economy.  Study state machines - computer science.

Chu got it mang
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:42:15
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:45:03
It IS a state apparatus.  
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:11:21
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:29:02
Note how bitcoin gets stable and the bad news begin? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:07:59
Push back.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:36:45
Oh, you're kidding.  Too many clowns, not enough jugglers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:14:27
Dang.  I thought It was avocado.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:32:01
Let's get the insults started.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:37:35
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:20:16
Yup.  It's the next.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:32:53
You went back 200 years and called yourself a caveman. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:28:20
The financial / economic system dates back to the Medici.  Traditional banking is over 2000 years old.   Isn't it time to replace old systems at some point like they do with outdated as/400 mainframes for .net cluster farms?  Except they aren't .net cluster farms but as/400 mainframe successors.  You still need large machines to handle the volume.
You betcha.  This, what were witnessing is the future of commerce, in the truest sense of the word.
In the movie the terminator there was man sized machines (I.e. .net cluster farms) and bigger sized monolithic robots.  Think of those as the mainframes.  There are jobs a terminator just can't do because it's too large. Likewise, a .net server farm can't handle batch transactions like a mainframe can.
When were talking about billions of transactions, aka the ledger, block size is key.  The bigger the block the larger the transaction.  Bitcoin, you see, is a block chain system, designed to scale for the NEXT.

Id put bitcoin on a "bush" any day.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:07:19
Spanky, Rein is that you?
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:35:05
It isn't about control yet, it's about power.  Power means nothing without control.  Take a Porsche.  No, seriously, invest and take a porsche.  
The control will come when it's power grows beyond its current mechanism of control.
Excellent question.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:10:29
Couldn't agree with you more
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:16:02
Dream bigger.  100,000+
It's like prayer.  The more people that do it the larger the effect.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:22:29
Just weeding out the idiots
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:14:04
Tears of joy
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:13:53
No no,  I believe I traveled it somewhere.  I'm trying to find out where.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:11:16
I don't know, I somehow hope I'll find where I sent it to.
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:53:59
saw this, im hoping praying someone did that on purpose.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:26:34
Love it

How do I find a wallet associated with 5a95fabaca?  On my hard drive or otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:13:19
Yes, it came from my first ever wallet.  When I got excited that it had grown fro 30usd to over 330usd I did "stuff" and that included sending it somewhere and then forgetting.  Probably for safe keeping.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:11:47
I spent them but they are sitting there, somewhere.  I want to find out where this somewhere is.
