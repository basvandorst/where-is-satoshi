Blockchain.info automatically provides your Bitcoin Cash. They can keep the gold. lol

Don't they time out though?

The bus? You mean the one that drives the astronauts to the launch pad? They're right about that, but the real rocket has yet to lift off if it wants to compete with global currencies and gold.

u/Calaber24p The real question is, when Bitcoin reaches 10,000 again by new years, will you eat the right one as well?

How would these paper contracts be transfered from custodian to custodian?

Would like some discussion

Well bitcoin has reached that market cap by providing a service of 300,000 transactions a day.
Litecoin has 1 MB blocks that are produced every 2,5 minutes, so 24 MB per hour vs Bitcoin's 6 MB.
Therefore you could fill it with 1,2 million transactions per hour.
At 300,000 it would have the same fees and problems bitcoin had at 75,000.
It essentially is Bitcoin 4X
On top it does not have forks that compete for mining power.

Isn't doublespending solved for once all transactions become segwit ones?
What are the problems btc need to solve?
I'd say lower transaction fees and increase the transaction throughput.
Bitcoin and Litecoin are both attempting to do that through segwit, schnorr signatures and some other things. But bitcoin does not seem to be living in today's world.
If 125 GB of blockchain rising 50 GB a year is a problem in 2017 then I don't know what to tell you.
100$ for another 77 years of bitcoin usage! 
100$ to run a node vs 3$ to make a transaction.
u/coblee has agreed with the miners to increase Litecoin's blocksize when blocks start to become half full.
I do think it's good to look for on chain scaling solutions but in Litecoins case there's a lot of time to do that. It wont hit 1 million transactions tomorrow.

Why not BitCent?
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:24:51
So at this price, what is the chance that 2016 blocks of it will get mined?
At the current price 2016 btc blocks are worth 120 million in revenue for miners. I'd guess they are very profitable right now, maybe 50% profit.
So the miner cost is lets say 60 million. This cost will be the same for 2x since the difficulty will be the same.
Who will want to mine 2X till the next difficulty if it costs 60 million and it only brings in 24 million (at a price 1/5th of btc)
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:25:33
So it's coming to Litecoin, not Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:11:10
Well the market cap calculator at coinmarketcap already takes that into account. See the asterix next to 38,305,800,000*

Yeah and banks buy via polo ::rolleyes::
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:12:47
Sorry but I think the Bitcoin based altcoin that can compete with Ether is already here.
It's Litecoin.
Sweet delicious low fee, Segwit enabled Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:50:46
Uhm mining is profitable.
I think you can do worse things than blocking bitcoin for an hour if you manage to get 6 confirmations in a row.
You can change the whole protocol which will only be rewritten if there's a string of 6 blocks that you didnt mine. This could probably be like a day or so.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:31:50
Good luck with 95% requirement and a lot of incentive to keep bitcoin down.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:25:21
Isn't this the safest storage of them all? The mempool? Lol just send them from your wallet without fee and no hacker can touch them for two weeks.

At least till greece, not into russia.

Yeah I get this but $5 transaction fees will kill those habits quite easily.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:13:09
I really believe this is the way, I know this is the weong subreddit but one of the camps needs to give up in order to let bitcoin live. Core will always have litecoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:21:43
Knowing sollicits proof. What you are talking about are assumptions.
"Everybody assumed btc-e was behind illicit operations." Thats a claim you can make. You cant say they knew.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:23:36
Litecoin does as well. When lightning network comes to litecoin it will even become instantaneous if I'm correct. Good for arbitrage.

Well if the allegations are true, some of their customers will probably not play by the rules either. They might be dead men walking if they dont bring the site back up. Maybe i watched too much tv

I really hope this is true. But hey btce is down and they are not communicating.
Plus wme.cc is still up

Two estimates one claiming 350 billion and one claiming 2 trillion.
But they are not well sourced so we should act as if they have what a paltry 2 billion and no power right? Right.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:14:17
But Litecoin didnt fall in the same way. It fell but less and definetely less during climax. Most stable of the three of em

They also have the French President in their bag (well the others too but from Macron its pretty obvious)

The potential new BIP148 altcoin doesn't bring anything new as compared to Litecoin, so this new altcoin is a scamcoin.
Haha I laughed hard at this. Fuck yeah. Litecoin is already Bitcoin 2.0 any other alt trying to be Bitcoin 2.0 will be nothing but a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:11:03
Its because they dont have the litecoins to pay people back. Litecoin has been artificially surpressed.

No he runs a competitor to bitaddress is how I read it.
He has the private keys to a lot of other people's wallet.
I'd call that pretty compromised.

Since you clearly don't bother to look to the evidence already provided by moonbux I'll just give it to you straight.
Here's how hillary owes Lynn Forester de Rothschil penance because she scooped Tony Blair away from them.
Even her campaign workers admit in private that she is tainted when it comes to being bribed:
12 million from the Moroccon King:

Because they are not the ruler of crypto's.
If bitcoin goes down, they go down.
If they go up, bitcoin doesn't necessarily go up.

What detailed information should I give. Hillary can be bought like a whore, this is pretty much general knowledge.
