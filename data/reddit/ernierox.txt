hi Tomas, i would bring up the fact that bitcoin is innovative and would create jobs, lower fee's for people doing remittances and is no way like all the other problems they should be focusing on, like citibank, hsbc, cartels etc. that's where they should be working and not against bitcoin, which is new, fresh and innovative, it would also help bring the population into a better technology based system, that is pretty much where its going to be anyways. i would definetly stay on the topic that in order for mexico to grow and move forward financially and technologically they need to, adapt and embrace such system as bitcoin. just my two satoshis :)
ps. i live in both the usa and mexico, border town, love coincove, and see nothing but good things in the future for btc in mx. oh yes, they also have a bunch of those unregulated peso/dollar exchange places all over mexico, that everyone knows are shady, just by you showing up to the meeting blows them away, since noone knows who exactly operates those lol
