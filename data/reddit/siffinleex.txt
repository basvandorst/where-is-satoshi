@_date: 2015-12-05 22:06:20
No it's not. The greenhouse effect is elementary science and we've put far more than enough into the atmosphere to effect it. You're straight up wrong. Anthropogenic climate change is accepted by 99.9% of climate scientists.
@_date: 2015-12-05 11:04:21
I know about LFTR, it looks really promising and I have always been an advocat for investing in that tech, I think maybe Russia is?
Anyway, I really don't think there are many people in the world who grasp who much energy is involved with climate change and how impractical it is to do anything about it. Once abrupt climate change begins, which it likely has, it's unstoppable. We will be at +5c in no time and that's virtually unsurvivable for almost every species on earth.
@_date: 2015-12-05 07:51:53
Sure, pure clean energy can't do some things, but fuels like hydrogen and [green carbon]( can do that.
If we invested properly in green technology a couple of decades ago, we would likely be in a much better position than we are now. I believe in libertarianism as a personal rule but applying it to the market is a disaster. Only regulation (not actually a dirty word) can ensure we don't use all our market power to head in the wrong direction.
We've only had one shot, well, I personally believe it's too late now. Abrupt climate change is almost certainly underway.

Uhh I was the one ridiculing you for pretending that co2, when released by humans, is somehow immune from the laws of physics. You're the one who denies climate change bro, not me.
I definitely know about methane being much worse than co2, it's fucking terrible and yes, if we wanted to actually stop anthropogenic climate change, we'd really have to stop growing so many cows. That's correct. That's how science works.
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:13:54
I've only looked at his wiki page, which is full of skeptism and studies done by people trying to validate his work have fallen short.
"More recently, Laken et al. (2012)[32] found that new high quality satellite data show that the El Niño Southern Oscillation is responsible for most changes in cloud cover at the global and regional levels. They also found that galactic cosmic rays, and total solar irradiance did not have any statistically significant influence on changes in cloud cover."
"Sloan and Wolfendale (2013)[34] demonstrated that while temperature models showed a small correlation every 22 years, less than 14 percent of global warming since the 1950s could be attributed to cosmic ray rate. The study concluded that the cosmic ray rate did not match the changes in temperature, indicating that it was not a causal relationship. Another 2013 study found, contrary to Svensmark's claims, "no statistically significant correlations between cosmic rays and global albedo or globally averaged cloud height."[35]"
"In April 2008, Professor Terry Sloan of Lancaster University published a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters titled "Testing the proposed causal link between cosmic rays and cloud cover",[28] which found no significant link between cloud cover and cosmic ray intensity in the last 20 year"
It seems like people can agree that there is something there but it is too small to matter and the evidence to suggest the greenhouse effect is responsible for increases in temperature change is so great, there is no need to look at anything else - kind of like how we know what in cigarettes is responsible for negative effects on health, rather than trying to relate it to something like the humidity in which a cigarette is smoked - anthropogenic greenhouse heating is at a ridiculous consensus amongst climate scientists, 99.9%
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:51:40
That's not an explanation as to why when humans generate co2 and put it into the atmosphere, it's somehow immune from the laws of thermodynamics. Anthropogenic climate change is obviously real and based on basic basic physics.
@_date: 2015-12-21 10:40:06
Umm we don't need to kill cows, we just need to stop breading them. You're the one talking about killing cows, I was talking about the scientific aspect of how the methane they release causes a massive problem altering the climate.

@_date: 2015-12-05 11:00:57
I really like all you've said but Dr Svensmark's stuff is far from convincing, I just feel like more people would take him seriously if it was and it would seem that the couple of people who've looked into his work haven't came to the same conclusions.
[Abrupt climate change]( is a much more likely explanation for the extreme climate change we're experiencing, which is triggered by only a small push from anthropogenic climate change. There are so many feedback cycles warming the arctic it's scary.
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:32:30
Our planet is a greenhouse gas planet, that's how it has the climate it does. We've understood how greenhouse gases work for over 100 years and that increasing their potency in the atmosphere leads to a temperature increase, it physically has to, it cannot not.
If you don't believe in anthropogenic climate change, then can you please explain how we could add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and not increase the temperature?

Have you ever heard of the Koch brothers? They're the elite perpetuating the scam that climate change isn't real or man made. You're the pleb who is their free foot soldier.
How can you morons who are deniers not see that? No where are the elites talking about climate change. In fact, the elites probably love climate change, it's a nice easy way to kill off people like you in mass so they can have the planet to themselves. Look at Obama, who you would no doubt consider one of these elites, he was just a few months ago signing permits to go and drill for oil in the arctic, how could anyone possibly say that he was trying to prevent climate change and burden the libtards through deceased economic activity - it's the other way around.
@_date: 2015-12-06 19:29:01
You're a great example of how people find evidence of what they want to believe. You almost certainly won't even believe it when the arctic ice is all melted. Elementary science my dear watson.

Your example using the baking and the super yacht is very extreme (value and time wise) but technology would be the answer to that question. Technology makes it significantly cheaper to build the super yacht.
Example (like yours but on a more realistic scale): How is it fair that the proceeds from a baking sale in 1990 can be worth the same amount in 2015 as a small hand held computer, more powerful than all of the computers in the world combined, which can play any media at any time and allow you to contact anyone with a similar device.

You're just looking at one side of the equation though, I'm more incentivised to make a bridge now if I know the value I get for it is going to stay the same or increase in the future, as opposed to becoming worthless.
I feel like it would be ideal if there was neither inflation or deflation and the value obtained for building each bridge was the same and held it's value over time.

If you're building the same bridge, the quality and craftsmanship of the old bridge would be ridiculously cheaper if you built it using todays technologies.
So, the old bridge.
As to whether work already done is less valuable than work yet to be done. Well, who's to say that before each bridge was yet to be built, they were both equally as valuable but perhaps since that bridge would have been more crucial to further advancement, then that bridge is more valuable - like a main branch of a tree as opposed to a smaller branch attached to a main branch.

Yep, you've pointed out a great distinction. Two coins could have exactly the same code bases but be different because it's not the code that makes something the same coin, it's the use of the same blockchain.
Litecoin had it's own genesis block/blockchain, therefore it is a different coin.
@_date: 2016-03-12 20:24:28
Just as exclusive as well. So. Many. Businesses. Don't. Bother. Because. Future. Uncertain.
Businesses are built off open, predictable markets. When people say, "block's aren't full yet" they're looking at this in the wrong way. People don't use it because the future is unstable, making the risk high.
Bitcoin should be worth a lot more now with a whole lot more cool shit going on, taking over the world of fintech.
Instead we're fucking stagnated in a 1mb shit pool of uninnovation - the fact that the blocks aren't full yet isn't the point, it's that they will be full and no one knows what the hell is going on that businesses and the market can't cope with.

Alt = Alternative. coin = coin.
If you're using the same blockchain, whether currently compatible or not, it's the same token (coin) born of the same genesis block. It's really that simple.
Of course you can take it further and see that no two blockchains born of the same genesis would exist alongside each other for long, even though in theory it's possible - though whether or not that happens and is possible has nothing to do with the definition of an altcoin. It's not altchain, it's altcoin.
All altchains have the same coin but a different chain, all altcoins have a different coin and by nature must therefore have a different chain as well.

Are you saying that these people aren't investing more money into their businesses because they are not profitable? No
Or are you saying that the businesses are profitable but they don't believe they will be in the future and hence want to take money out while they can? No
I'm not saying either of those things. I'm saying it doesn't matter whether the business is profitable at the moment or not, I'm saying the future involves too much risk to justify any extra development. In these cases, the businesses aren't profitable which makes it harder again to justify more development when these businesses won't make a good profit unless bitcoin gets used as a currency. Which is how it was when these businesses started funnily enough but that seems to have changed recently.

You're right, the one thing it can't survive is network stagnation by not being allowed to grow, which is exactly the problem Mike is pointing out and the reason he's not putting any more time and thought into this.

@_date: 2016-01-18 18:36:10
I see we're you're going wrong. You seem to think that both chains can operate at the same time. While in theory it's possible, in practise it would never happen. So there isn't actually a case where there can be two coins on the same chain for one of them to be called an 'alt'.
That's the entire point, you have one, or the other and they're the same thing, bitcoin. What you're repeating is weak thymos branded propaganda. Glad I could help you out of that mess, feel free to tip me.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:43:19
That's not the argument. Those other coins aren't using the same blockchain, XT and Classic are bitcoin, not altcoins.
How is this not obvious? What am I missing when people say that XT is an altcoin if it uses the same chain and cannot exist without the original chain? Please explain this or stop using that thymos® explanation as if it's not completely flawed logic.

I get the argument that blocks might not be full but let me make 2 points on that:
A) We need to be well prepared for a surge before blocks are full. We have no idea when demand could rise exponentially.
B) I find it hard to sell people on the idea of bitcoin when it has such severe limitations. I find it hard to imagine investing money and building a business around bitcoin because of the uncertainty around how it will handle the transactions it needs to handle to be a success. I used to tell people about btc but I don't anymore because I don't want to get people excited about something with such a large flaw.
Anyway, kind of just ranting here. Love you all and BTC, let's make it awesome.

Exactly, miners can maximize tips by increasing the number of passengers so the number of tips increases.

How does this compare to blockchains though?

Who in their right mind thinks up this stuff and then has the time and life to afford to spend pursuing it?

Okay, in my first comment I said it was inevitably going to fail and I said in the same comment and I quote, 'so bitcoin isn't really riskier at this stage'. So I didn't regress and say it was equally as risky, I said that right in the first comment.
It was always just my opinion that the failure of fiat is inevitable, it's a funny world we live in but something can be a fact and then you can also have an opinion on it. Just like it's a fact that there isn't an omnipotent god being like followers of many religions believe but it is their opinion that there is. It's sucks and it's shitty logic but it's true. I haven't moved the goalposts on anything I've said, you've just succeeded in attacking me and making it look that way.
And to defend myself against your last point, you say that I've changed my opinion and now say fiat might be risky in a few years. Are you even reading what I wrote? I wasn't even talking about my opinion, I was talking about your opinion and I quote "you might not share the opinion that fiat is risky now but you might in a few years.". If you read that properly, I'm saying that when fiat fails, you still may not share the opinion that it's risky.
Thanks for being friendly and listening to another person's point of view.

Well, you might be right about one of those, you're definitely right about another and you're definitely wrong about the last one.

What would happen is it would be all champagne and high fives until it forks. Then it will be all infighting and distrust. Could be a good thing?

I think Google do give a shit but a combination of things has stopped them from being a leader when it comes to bitcoin.
I wouldn't be surprised if Google, along with an aviary of other companies, isn't perched to act once the bitcoin blockchain is proven to be here to stay. I believe solving the blocksize problem is key to this stabilisation.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:55:27
Same risk as if they don't do it though.

Fortunately, the cost of doing so falls as hardware, bandwidth and electricity become cheaper.

I think they missed maybe the only opportunity here try and get things moving again.
Things have becomes so inverse at this point that the economy is beheld to the markets. They markets were prepared for a small raise and almost won't be able to start healthy growth until there is.
@_date: 2015-09-18 07:01:06
Amen. The current global finances are a total utter mess, near 0% interest rates for years, some with negatives rates, it's clear that the way the market grew to be during the last 80 years has changed a lot in the last 15. No longer do the normal tools work for controlling things.
Now the market makers control everything and the market isn't real anymore. It really does seem like the feds (as terrible as their institution is) aren't in control anymore and neither is the natural market. It's just financiers juggling the worlds markets using insanely complex financial instruments which are all tied together.
Who knows how this crazy fucking shit is going to end, I don't think anyone does.

I imagine consensus will only accelerate from here.

Then why not just trust each other to use a spreadsheet? or any other database system which doesn't care about trust because there aren't varying degrees of trust - you either have trust, or you don't.
No matter how much people who want their own blockchain say they don't care as much about trust, it's all they'll care about once their blockchain can't be trusted!

No real voting system is going to allow anyone to know who you voted for. You can only sell your vote if who you voted for can be proven.

We want our subreddit back and you're an absolutely terrible moderator. You make it personal, when that's exactly what a moderator isn't supposed to do.

I love it and the reasoning for this as opposed to the popular option (character support and not the symbol of another major currency). Your option feels like it has pure roots, which pleases my reptilian brain.

I don't want a new name for 'blockchain', a blockchain is a blockchain, that's a solid noun. What I want it to start referring to the bitcoin blockchain as 'the Blockchain' the same was we refer to 'the Internet'. However, I guess that extremely simple concept was far too much for the people of this sub.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:17:24
I'm going to a potluck dinner tonight, I'm going to give every person $3 in bitcoin and get them to give a micro donation to one of the charities you've listed, thanks so much for the list!
@_date: 2015-10-30 00:38:17
Bitcoin stands on it's own, how does that make it a compliment?
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:28:55
I made a post about referring to the bitcoin blockchain as 'the Blockchain'. That would really help us see bitcoin's blockchain apart from all other blockchains when writing or talking in instances like this.
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:34:40
No, I think trusting a blockchain is binary, you either do or you don't.

No, I mean, what evidence do they really have? If the only evidence they have is IP related and nothing physical, what do you need to defend against? How could you defend against a non case.

Cool idea. Your site design doesn't look so enticing. What I mean is that it looks like it's been styled reasonably well but there isn't much consistency, which gives me a feeling of mistrust.
If you want to get consistency easily, I suggest using a front end framework like twitter bootstrap or zurb foundation.

So nice to see a price that can be globally understood as opposed to someone saying '$30' and you're thinking, that's probably USD, now if I convert that...I can get a rough idea.

If it doesn't have enough stored energy, it won't grow extra roots. You're making the assumption that this tiny plant has enough energy to at least double it's size without any extra carbon.

I don't get it, can you explain what's funny about it please?
@_date: 2016-07-28 09:27:05
No, the blockchain was support to be money for the internet, now it's crippling into a store of value which is a fraction of the miracle it could be.
2cool2fish is right, now is the time to have an alternative banking system rising to compete but bitcoin never made it, it's slow and shitty.

It's interesting not just because of the inflation/deflation aspect but because traditional monetary inflation has been a solution to a problem of indivisible units. One USD can only liquidate into 100 pieces, not 1 million. So with bitcoin, you don't need to worry about people needing more cash in the hand, they already have that they just need to realise it's worth more and prices can drop accordingly. Inflation then becomes an internal feature of the currency, rather than an external influence.
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:42:13
Awesome, thanks for supporting BTC. What is your company though?

How would you defend yourself if you weren't guilty?
I wonder how he could defend himself apart from having alibis for specific known events, which of course can never be specific on the internet.
