The price of bitcoin is one of the most important things ever happen to humanity, everybody should pay attention. There has never been something in life that only ever goes op in value. Satoshi was a genius he created digital hyper gold and made poor people rich.

If the rest of the world understand what benefits a crypto currenty has against a fiat based currency, bitcoins maybe eventually become the most popular currency of the internet, and when there is no more cash money, the most popular currency in the world. I am sure the rich big bankers and people with lots of power because they are (partly) in control of the monetary system would do anything to keep that control. What if your US dollars start loosing value against the bitcoin fast? And the only way to save your investments is to buy bitcoins. But when you have all these bitcoins there is no power anymore you can influence with them because of the design of the bitcoin system and its transparency. Also the bitcoin system would make it a lot easier to avoid taxes. What if I buy everything I need in bitcoins that I mine myself. I could stop paying taxes all together because I would not have an income in the currency of my country. So there are a million reasons why the bitcoin system at one point in time might become a threat to our current society. If that ever happens in like 20 - 50 years. It will be an interesting time online, I can tell you that.
