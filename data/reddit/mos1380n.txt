I won't be converting it back to usd, so I should be fine. Right?

If we do something similar to an analog clock with a handle, the space between 3 and 6 could represent 100'000 and the distance between 6 and 9 could represent 100,000,000. Like how audio taper potentiometers work.

I have no idea what you mean by spreads.

Hi, bit of a newbie here. If someone from the us buys eth or btc for me, are they subjected to any taxes or are your assets only taxes when you convert it back to usd?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:48:49
Yeah I compared the prices to what I can get here and it's still alot better than what I can get over here.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:37:10
premium for buying from localbitcoins?
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:10:33
it could be a logarithmic clock

People seeing bitcoin as "magical internet money" isn't a problem since bitcoin is supposed to be a currency but people who see bitcoin as "magical get rich shares" are the curse.

Do people not understand btc price fluctuates? Every time it goes up everyone starts talking about a bull market and every time it goes down everyone starts talking about how btc is dead for now. Btc price is currently well without it's current fluctuation range, nothing special has happened.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:32:09
Anyone care to give me a reason why there isn't a high chance of a correction/ drop happening real soon? At this point it feels like everyone is panic buying based on hype and bitcoin is just being pumped.Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to spread FUD, I'm as inexperienced as one can get in the crypto world but the recent gains seem a little too much.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:50:44
looks like a dump and pump to me
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:18:39
imo anything significantly lower than the recent low (which was somewhere in the high 5000s) is a sign to worry about, if bitcoin keeps doing what's it's been doing in the past 9 years we should slowly start making our way back up untill the market is confident enough to start another hype cycle but hey I don't have any magic balls so who knows
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:02:21
it's hardly a reliable observation if it has only happened once

makes sense since a lot of crypto enthusiasts would probably prefer to gold as a store of value over usd
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:55:40
okay john
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:36:17
Next time you might want to go to one of those sketchy "we buy gold" stores in the hood and see if they also buy btc. You'll have a lower chance of getting fucked over by them than the banks.
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:21:53
everyone should flood all exchanges and sell all their crypto for fiat right now

Automating money, governance, timestamping, ect... there's a lot of stuff you can do with blockchain but most of them are rather hard to implement and are going to need some time to develop into actual useful things.
The main shtick of blockchain and bitcoin is decentralising systems, because once a centralised system gets bigger than a certain threshold, the benefits that come with centralisation don't really scale that well and that system becomes rather fragile.

You all act like the second thing that comes up when you Google crypto isn't "the value is almost completely speculative and it's a very high risk investment".
@_date: 2019-01-07 12:33:20

Why pay a monthly fee for expensive cloud storage when you can put something on a public blockchain once and have it stay there as long as there is a node for free?

Problem is in these situations it usually becomes very difficult and sometimes illegal to buy foreign fiat currencies, but they could've bought bitcoin and converted it into some stable coin ig.
