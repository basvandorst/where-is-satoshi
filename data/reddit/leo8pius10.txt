Again I would argue Bitcoin is repeating what Gold was.
Bitcoin is digital Gold

Your definition  is fine accept the word "forced" and "radical"
Bitcoin is/will only succeed with the voluntary(not forced) acceptance by individuals and community.  Thus it fits the Counterrevolution definition.
I would agree with you that it is a revolution if it was forced, but it is voluntary.  People are choosing of their own free will to join Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not "radical" it is an innovative improvement on Gold.  Fiat currencies are radical.  Bitcoin is using technology to enhance what Gold was.  This the Fiat currency economy is the revolution and Bitcoin is the Counterrevolution which will bring back sanity and stability. 
Thank you for your post

Okay? How do you support your opinion?  
I disagree with your statement.... But will entertain your opinion if you support your argument with logical/rational evidence.
Thank you!

Haha - obviously the powers who control current system will resist the change.

Spider has a valid point.  Bitcoin is definitely deflationary!  If it becomes a currency it will be the complete opposite of every currency used today.  Everyone will have to be educated on how this will dramatically change the world economy.  
We as a community must educate ourselves on how this will change our daily lives.  
Let me give you a example.  First imagine the world with Bitcoin as the World currency.  Before Bitcoin you used to go on three vacations a years to party and burn money for blissful fun.  You cannot remember anything from any of these trips.  
Now you are planning your three trips in 2022 the year bitcoin is the currency of the World.  As you plan your trip over January you notice that your 2 Bitcoins you saved for three trips has grown in value(deflationary).  Now you ponder if you want to go get blind drunk.  Are you willing to spend your Bitcoin on three vacations that really have no value?  
After further evaluation you decide to go on one vacation.  You love beer and decide to visit Germany and Belgium and visit the ancient Monastic Monasteries that brew Chimey, Duvel, etc.
You have decided Bitcoin has value so when you spend it you want it to be worth something.  Getting blind drunk on lite beers does not seem to be a good way to spend your money anymore.

I think it is important to define it as a Counterrevolution.  I am not supporting a "end justifies the means" revolt.  I am supporting a Counterrevolution which brings stability to communities.

Please educate me by answering the following questions
Can anyone change the rate of inflation of peer coin or dog coin?
What is the rate of inflation for each? Links would help me understand.
I am not familiar with the properties of inflationary crypto coins.
Thanks in advance

Not really
Hitler was not a counterrevolution 
Soviet Union communism was not a counterrevolution
Iraq invasion was not a counterrevolution
French Revolution was not a counterrevolution
Libya invasion was not a counterrevolution
Syria invasion was not a counterrevolution
Iran kicking CIA/Shah(1979) out of country was a counterrevolution 
Iceland refusing to make Bank debt into government debt was a counterrevolution

If it is a evolution what is it evolving from?  What will it evolve to?
I argue it is simply a better Gold.  
Easier to protect
Easier to distribute because divisibility.

Bitcoin is digital gold.
At least we do not have to swallow Bitcoin to get thru customs.  
Please read link very funny.

The money is made in the conversion.  If  I the  Indian is paid in Dubai currency, the Bank will convert to Rupee before providing the free wire.  The conversion rate  provided is very profitable for the Bank.  No need for a fee.

It matters because revolutions lack a foundation.  The focus is just on disrupting the current power at any cost.  When the revolution has succeeded there is nothing to support the revolution.  As a result, another revolution is started to remove the new power (previous revolution).
A Counterrevolution recognises that the current power is evil revolutionary and works to remove the current power
However the counterrevolution does not use evil to remove them.
For example - in revolution you often hear "the ends justify the means" which says I can do evil because the system must be removed at all cost
In a Counterrevolution the "ends do not justify the means"
For example, Bitcoin should not promote Usury loans because they are a product of Fiat immoral current system.
In conclusion, a counterrevolution is attempting to bring back rational stability to a economic system.  It's overall goal is stability.  It is not rooted in anger and revenge.  
As a result, a counterrevolution focuses on implementing a foundation when the Fiat world collapses.  The Bitcoin community is working on this.
Questions like
How do we loan money in a deflationary environment?
What will the banks role be?
@_date: 2014-04-20 05:14:39
I agree!
I also believe most in the Bitcoin community do not really understand what they are wishing for.
A deflationary currency transform economic activity.

Very interesting.

Bitcoin is deflationary and that is why I Love it!!!
Who needs Walmart super sized packaged goods!  
Look at Old Europe - remember  those cities were built when gold and silver were currencies.  Look at the detail and value in the design.
Remember we spend like crazy because our currency loses value.
By the way in old Feudal societies the farmer/peasant rented the land and paid the Landlord a % of the crop yield.  This is how employers would pay people in a deflationary currency environment.  All employees would receive get profit sharing.  
This is a better system because then everyone adds value to final product and is paid accordingly.
@_date: 2014-04-19 06:11:02
I am not disagreeing with you.  In the current system Bitcoin as a currency would be problematic.  Telling an employee that their salary has been reduced by 10% because of deflation would be impossible in current environment.  However current salary increase of 3% is not keeping up with hyper inflation either.   
The genius of Bitcoin no matter if it becomes the World currency is people are understanding the evils of Fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:24:59
Wait so you are saying Bitcoin which is a "better gold" is not going back to a time when currency was backed by an asset?
@_date: 2014-04-19 07:06:16
I am a fan of a deflationary model because it rewards savers.  The issue in the long term with inflationary currencies is the hyper spender is rewarded.  The saver who values his time, and saving money for a rainy day is punished.
With a deflationary currency the tables are flipped.  The saver is rewarded and the spender is punished.
Now everyone will have to spend money!  However in a deflationary currency model people will think before spending.  
Bitcoin = value
As a result, the spender will think rationally before purchasing.  I would argue people will purchase less, and purchase things which add value to their lives.  
For example people will choose to eat good cheese instead of "cheese food".  If I am spending Bitcoin which will be more valuable tomorrow I want to spend it on the best.
Fiat "inflationary" currency is revolutionary.  It rewards the risk taker.
Bitcoin "deflationary" currency is counter revolutionary.  It rewards the saver.
I have enjoyed the discussion, and thank you for posting a very relevant topic!

This is the perfect application for the remittance market.
I setup my gateways in two countries and receive cash payment on both ends or one end.  My payment is the exchange rate and small fee in the gateways.
What do you think?
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:33:35
I will give you an example that supports the definition you provided.
Ireland decided to make the private debt of Anglo Irish Bank a public debt.  Meaning when Anglo went bankrupt the people of Ireland took responsibility for the debt.  If the Irish people decide to drop the Euro and use Bitcoin they are taking part in a Counterrevolution.
The foreign fiat banks forced this debt on the public books.  There is no way the Irish people will ever get out from under this enormous pile of debt which they are not responsible for.  If they reject the Euro it would be a Counterrevolution to the revolutionary action of the European Union making the Irish people responsible for a private banks debt.
