Thanks  alot. Well understood. International diversification sounds key here.
In terms of countries like my question below: which one will be the citadel places?   
\* USA
\* Canada
\* Lichtenstein/Switzerland?
\* Georgia?
\* Panama?
\* Malta?
\* China / Hong Kong?
\* others...

Besides kyc  and tax which you can mitigate by moving to friendly places. And yes, there are many cool countries welcoming you with open arms if you come and spend money inside their economy or even better invest something or start a business.
* Too hard to use for non tech people and mostly boomers, who would need it most for saving their retirement funds.  
\* Improve the UX vastly 
* Safe private key storage

There are different ways of looking at it
1. He either is downright evil and enjoys bullshitting trusting people
2. Outright incompetence and he believes in what he is saying and thats the right way to do
3. Controlled puppet and hes controlled by carrot and stick approach.
4. Various mix in between
Throughout western gov these are the people you encounter.  I tend towards 2. which is by far the most common with various degrees of 1. and 3.

Why waste money if you can easily make x-1000-times from a better point?

Those are not capitalists. At best these money socalists  are cronies   who reach their position by gameing the system and knowing the right people.
The approach to regulation as up to now, 2019 does absoluetly not help.   
There were Lehman certificates become worthless and the cdos from the us housing market. The list of tight regulation not working is a long as the bible.   
aml/kyc is another regulation set which is entirely uneffective and resembles more of a which hunt than something it has been originally intended to prevent. 
To come back to the topic. These are institutions people have trust in, esp older ones who have not been burned badly yet.
It is highly unethical behavior even though you can frame it of being completely "legal" and "according to all xyz regulations and international law".
TV commercials in most places face restrictions against drugs for exactly that reason.

Yes, to some extent. But it is very transparent and also decreasing as bitcoin becomes more widespread. Also about everyone at least also could become a (at least minor) miner.    
Compare this to the current fractional reserve / fiat banking system where inflation is largely hidden and high.
If your not part of this club you will never get in as George Carlin already stated.

Congrats sunny! You have just been cited by the TimeTraveler!

Thats what is commonly stated. Every country however has its own tbtf banks. Depending on the size of the country this fucks up the world or not depending on how strongly they are integrated.
I agree with you that we should divide it into small A) local banks without being integrated into gov and B) the ones who are.
category A) are still somewhat resembling businesses to some extent.
B) are not "just businesses" as they enjoy monopoly status and protection which other business do not.
No other business can loan out and having only x% of it. Everyone else would get ffff'd deeply by doing so. It is not singling out. It is stating how this system works right now. 
Btw. Saifedean Ammous stated the evolving of modern day banking in his book bitcoin standard.

What should your reference prove exactly?   
Of course the story can borrowd from anywhere or made up out of nothin but a splendid fantasy and consistency.   
anyhow just very entertaining and dr who knows maybe maybe its one reality

Frankly speaking it sounds plausible to me if you can do these trips, someone else, and if only a handful of people, also can do it and this might cause changes.

Which countries there will be better than the others?   
From other posts according to TimeTravewler, in big city (safe neighbourhood) you gonna be ok.  
Maybe if you consider move.  
Easy ones:

* Costa Rica?
* Uruguay?
* Chile (see Davinji15)?
Difficult ones:
* Venezuela?
* Brazil?
* Argentina?
* Central Latin America, except Panama and Costa Rica
* Latin Caribbean islands

You cant really live modern life without banks.
However, their service/usefulness varies immensely depending on jurisdiction.

Paraguay?  
If expensive is a concern, either wait longer until the value of coin go up or go to a cheaper place with less security.

No, it is not "just a business" as you state. They enjoy very special unmatched privileges as:
* tbtf protection
* Seigniorage
Especially not in western world where they can freely hand out fake money atm. The reason Venezuela and Turkey cant is bc the demand for their currency is lower and thus inflates faster than an usd or euro will.   
You should work in banking above the teller level and you will will get to know all kinds of scams, incompetence, arrogance, scheming going on.   
The client fucking with overpriced worthless stuff is just a very minor thing compared to loaning out / fractional reserve.

What can we do to ease the hairy period between now/2025+ and 2050 where earth is thriving?
Some ideas: 
* Educate the people in close proximity about fiat money and btc. 
* Try to bring btc to boomers now who will freak out once their precious gov pension turns to quicksand.
* Spread the word while keeping oneself safe

The current system is largely based on your cooperation and you puking your information they are looking for.  
You do not have to prove your innocence even if the western world moves into that direction. If you manage to keep to yourself without spilling too much info about yourself you will be ok. 
They are trained for extracting info they need   so being quiet is not as easy as you think here on reddit. 
If you are overly worried, train it once. 
The whole kyc thing is not really effective for what is has been intended and morphed largely into a yuge surveilance racket. You having been forced to hand out id copies for travel, hotel reservations, money exchange and what not opens widely the door for other actors getting a copiy of your docs and hence you can say it has been used without your consent. 
Tumbling / CJ surely can work but the best thing is to move yourself to a gov which respect need for privacy and financial freedom. That is by far the most effective way as you bring wealth to those who deserve it and take it away from those who want to crash your well being.

Check out the blog of Martin Armstrong/ Zerohedge.
Acording to him the Epstein case could be a shaker of global confidence in the current ruling system / elites. Maybe that event messed the timeline up because it wakes up a lot of ppl

There are private high sec storage facilities offering the same as banks but with better sec and service as they are obviously not involved in the fractional reserve banking scheme.   
Modern day banking do not want or need safe boxes as they profit from your so called money not being there.  
If box, dake one from outside the banking system.

This is called the mandate of heaven and its old Chinese concept.
I would trade that in for the shitfuckery in the west with so called "democracy".   
If I'd be left alone to do my business Id be happy, but thats almost impossible and I think if we are not really living in a debt slavery.  
In China debt is very constrained to house speculation

Timetraveler, in short what are the best behaviours to keep her own safety?   
Not randomly disclose her own stash come to mind but what else?
