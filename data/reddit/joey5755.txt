Welcome to bitcoin.  Someone is always either trying to push the value up or down.
I'll stand by the observation though.  The only hyped comment I made is that this site is orders of magnitude larger than other bitcoin projects.  If its true, thats worth pointing out?  And my guess would be its true.  As a programmer, this would take me years to do so I'm guessing it took them years and a full team to do.
Honestly have a look at the other bitcoin stuff we have.  Cheers to them for participating, but they are _not_ big businesses.

Seriously though, I need you people to join so I can play poker.  They just came on so the tables are empty :(
The site owner announced here and is answering questions and stuff:

The impressiveness of the developers work may not translate into users.  But would you seriously compare the other weekend hobby projects to this site?  So that's why the down votes? Guess we should only support hobby sites so bitcoin can stay where it's at?
If Amazon started taking btc I would buy more coins then evangelize the crap out of Amazon for the ride.

Yep I was wrong on this one.

First:  Whoops!  I did a quick search and didn't find this, so I double posted.
Second: (edited) This is bitcoin, so there doesn't have to be a clear path.  But Sapphire appears to be staying in line with US laws so you won't be able to join.

I'm from Canada and I originally suggested US users to join "from Canada", but they shut that down quick.  If you are Canadian, they verify that before you are allowed to deposit.
Obviously that leaves a ton of cash on the table, but at least bitcoin doesn't get another black eye for US govt.

Not my site.  I can prove it, ask me anything and I won't know jack shit!  I think I answered your question though.
"Do you understand what an order of magnitude is?"
Lol.  Weekend of coding vs 20 days of coding vs 200 days of coding?

Ok have fun on btcontilt.com. When my mom was on AOL keyword Oprah, I told her about the real internet too.

Yo.  Order of magnitude bigger site just started up.  Lets get on the bandwagon: 
(no, I ain't involved with them, but its in all of our interests to have this site take off)

The difference is that this site is orders of magnitude larger than anything done in the bitcoin economy to yet.
The gaming is actually great too, but irrelevant to the significance.  The impact to bitcoin is the scale of this project.
EDIT:  The deleted parent comment was - "Aren't there 5 bitcoin gambling sites already?"
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:51:48
Nope.  But do you hold bitcoin?  Market cap is about $100m.  Do people need $100m for day to day currency use?  Not even close.
Wouldn't you want gamblers to need your currency?

Edit: Sadly, true.

Well I feel bad for them now...
Decent site, but a pro one just came online-  
I just posted a separate thread on it.
