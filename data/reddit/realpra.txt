+1 we need sharding. I posted about it a long time ago:

What if I can't make a transaction, should I be concerned then or is that fine?
Since Blockstream is so excited about node power, how will they feel about it if someone decides to schedule a hardfork to 2mb without miner vote?
Then the users could actually choose what to run.
I'm guessing Blockstream will have a different tune then about individual nodes using their power ;)

Our "terminal" will be an app installed on your android or pc and a connector cable worth some 10$.
You can use this on the street or on the beach where VISA/MC is currently not easy/possible to use.
And of course the future is Bitcoin.

Unfortunately that will not improve the trust model, since we program the card we could send the BTC where we want no matter the key generation/input scheme.
This is why we intend to become the "original trusted brand".

It is true our product is not finished yet, but we have the physical cards and we are programming them.
I estimate we could reach market before or at the same time as the competitors I know about.
Important to note is that we are not charging people yet, so we are funding this ourselves.

Well I suppose building a backdoor would take like one day more ;)
The BTC send/receive software of the card and all the terminal will be open source.
This means you can make your own cards and they will work, but without additional effort they will be less secure than our paid cards.
The hardware card is one we are buying.
EDIT: I would make the addresses and keys unknown to us/prevent backdoor potential if I knew a way so I'm not trying to ridicule you here.

The card will check that the transaction hash is connected to the block chain or part of it at least.
We won't check history though, so the terminal could attempt a double spend - which should fail, so its fine.
