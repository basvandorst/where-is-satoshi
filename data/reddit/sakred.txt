Unfortunately the current dev team has no idea what gave BTC its value and made it so brilliant. They've fucked it, they've fucked it right in the ass and it's no longer a viable currency. Tipping with BTC used to be a thing, but it's not anymore.

Is this a service people would actually be interested in? I could probably do it at that price. What type of access to the machine would you want? Would you want it to do anything else aside from be a BTC node?

When? Doesn't look like they have an MSB yet, are they just winging it?
Edit: Looks like Lamassu machines, and it is live apparently. 
This isn't an ATM, it's a BTC vending machine.

If people were deceived in order for these trades to occur providing an unfair advantage to the deceiver, then it is fraud. There is certainly enough of a pattern of deceit, information withholding, and insider trading to warrant an investigation.

This is hilariously uninformed. The very first thing purchased with BTC was a pizza and until the economically illiterate infiltrated BTC development, it was perfectly suited for small daily transactions. 
Also, "you're" is the word you're looking for. As in YOU ARE, not YOUR which indicates possession.

Yeah, of 1.0, not 0.1. He said he was trying to move .1 btc, which means that the suggested fee of .06 btc is 60%, as he wrote.

No shit. In other news water is wet, blue and yellow make green.


People also think lizard-men have taken over US Government. What "people" say isn't a good indication of anything. Who gives a shit what people that don't understand it say about it? Their ignorance cannot stop BTC. 


Why do you presume this is going to happen? Further, how could it possible be that a large amount of people investing in Bitcoin could do anything but drive the price up?


This leads me to believe you don't have sufficient knowledge to explain BTC to them which implies that you don't understand it or the implications and potential of it. BTC is not going to be hurt by lots of people buying them up.

There are literally like 2 steps involved. I've never had to do this process, never used a wallet, and otherwise have no knowledge of the process, here is what he said.
*  Step 1: Get your blockchain.info wallet private key in Bitcoin-qt format
*  Step 2: In the Bitcoin-qt client issue the command "importprivkey &lt;yourkeyhere&gt;"

This video shows literally nothing related to anything they claim it does. Congrats on the program that chews up 100% cpu and spits out numbers and operators. How can anyone take this seriously as a demonstration of his claim when it doesn't show anything related to the claim?

The price of Bitcoins has nothing to do with the viability of the network to transfer those coins, and thus value. The volatility in the price of coins adds a certain risk factor, but those who understand and appreciate the long term implications of BTC are willing to "ride it out" until wider spread adoption and market participation reduces short term volatility.

No, I'm sorry. I'm speaking specifically about income tax on individuals. I agree with taxing goods to a degree, like gas to pay for road maintenance. I'm mixed on property taxes, but feel there are good arguments on both sides.

I understand your point, and you're right, but he technology is only 4 years old. PCs themselves took quite a while to become user friendly enough for the majority of people to be able to use them. Early adopters of a technology are always the ones dealing with the more complex issues and problems facing the technology. That being said, the process listed above really doesn't seem that difficult to grasp provided you know what all the components he mentioned are.... Which you should if you're using them.

I'd fill the database with 30 million or so orders. I'd show the database and the orders as they exist. I'd run the program with a timer, and then show the "filled" orders as they exist in the database after being filled. It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:28:08
Okay, basically it's like this:
Person 1: "I just painted 300 rocks!"
Person 1 in an attempt to prove this feat shows a video of the paint he used.
Me: That doesn't prove anything.
You: What more proof could you want, he clearly uploaded a video of paint.
Me: A video of him painting the rocks, or a before and after shot of the rocks would be a start.
You: But you can fake that.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:32:04
Then it's a poorly titled video, has no purpose accompanying the claim, and my original comment remains accurate. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:31:40
Well, not only that, but you would need to solve the "counterfeit" block before the rest of the 49% solve the correct version of it. If you can do this you could "unsend" coins, but you couldn't create extra coins or steal money using this method. So basically you would need to purchase something of immense value, and then create a fake chain where that exchange didn't take place, acquire the goods before the block is solved ("happens about every 10 minutes"), and then solve your own version of the block and get your money back. Of course any seller could prevent this by waiting an hour or so to transfer the goods to the buyer.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:19:45
You've made an incredible amount of assumptions throughout this thread, implied that Bitcoin wasn't a "viable value transfer network" and make general presumptions about how everybody in the world that sees this picture invests. 


This doesn't make any sense. I feel like you're grasping at straws saying things you don't understand to make a point you haven't really thought out. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:27:34
Can you point to any spot in the video where anything he claims is actually demonstrated?

Bitcoin is a viable value transfer network, don't imply that it's not.

I hold no belief or disbelief about his claims, I'm just pointing out this video does not demonstrate anything.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:19:52
Yes, but at least it's a demonstration of the claims. This is just a guy running a program which outputs numbers to a terminal. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:04:06

@_date: 2013-07-09 16:55:10
Yeah... but I don't understand why you're assuming a software engineer would simply bundle a 3rd party program into their software and run it with a system proc call rather than to actually code a miner into the software. The former would be discovered immediately.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:38:28
I'm saying ANY quantity of data or ANY demonstration of what is happening, what this engine does, will better validate the claim in that it'd actually be attempting to do so. This video does not show what the title leads one to believe it does. You could literally swap the video out for anything else and it would be equally as informative in regards to the matching engine

I don't find it implausible in the least. I'm saying the video shows nothing related to the claims.
