I sent my family $20,000 in btc in Jan. Took just 30mins for them to receive the $12,678. I'm glad I didn't pay any fees to send $6950.

Bitcoin is a currency. A currency has 3 properties. Store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. 
The disruptive nature of btc is that it possesses a duality dilemma between finity and stability as a store of value. What's finite cannot be stable. What's stable cannot be finite.
If you think oil and gold are finite, you are right theoretically. However, that finity perspective can yet be mathematically or scientifically proven.
Disclaimer:I'm a late gen x and first of millennials. I believe the millennial and genz perspective will give btc its value. Just like how baby boomers and gen x perceive gold and securities as store of value

Hi, thanks for sharing. Offering an eclectic view. 
I come from Singapore, where the exchange rate from good monetary governance, has brought the exchange down from $1.80 to 1.35 today over the last 18 years. 
Sad to say, the Feds printing machine raising interest rates have a global impact on people here too. I'm kinda done with the "velocity" of fiat and regret to the nth order on taking a housing loan here in Singapore, where interest rates are pegged to the Fed rate. 
I invest in DLTs too, because I'm done with the hegemony of the US dollar. Btc is - 67% from ath, but at least there's a choice now on how the world should see value.

Bitcoin just gives you the libertarian choice to move from one form of hegemony to the next.

I think beyond economic disparity; the intellectual disparity of what the world knows is being disrupted hard. From mad academics to crazy ideologies. 
I'm worried that universities fall after the fall of banks. That's pretty anarchic.

Yea, I calculated that I spend about 2 months of my life a year paying “interest" to banks and bankers. Never stupid again

I will use a macro economic example. The Latin America crisis of 1978. Feds raise interest rates, whole of South America goes kaput. Different but same

You might want to factor in the btc transaction fees too, since it's a small amount. There's a currency out there that's feeless but I will leave it to you to find that out.
Edit. You continue to incur fees when u send btc to your friends.
