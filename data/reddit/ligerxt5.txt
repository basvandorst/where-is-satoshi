Thank you!

Wasn't aware of that. I've heard of Shift cards.
Took a look, and appears to only allow using my BTC Account on coinbase. I do have some ETH that I was hoping to sell off first, but I don't think converting is going to hurt. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:34:50
And yet another good tip! Thanks! I nearly forgot I had a gdax account, so that was quick and easy.
I'm currently waiting for my shiftcard, so we'll see how that goes. Thanks!

Correct me if I'm wrong, I myself is still learning of bitcoin and exchanges.
One of the two was bought out by the other. Which way it was, I don't recall.

I live in NW Oklahoma. Other than Central National Bank, the other banks in my town do not appear on its list. If there was a way to add my routing and account number, which I've not seen or mistakenly overlooked it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:29:23
I see no such tab.

I have about $130 sitting in coinbase, from using nicehash. Been waiting for paypal to start working again, however that appears unlikely in the new future.
I've looked at other exchanges to convert to cash, but as a new crypto user (many months, just not a lot of time spent altogether, just mining and holding about half), I'm lost on a decent exchange that uses paypal or allows me to use my small bank, and doesn't cost and arm or a leg in transfers and withdrawing.

I was looking for the coinbase app for android. I couldn't find one that looked legitimate. All the Dev names didn't look like something from coinbase. Blame my ignorance, but none looked first party, just third party. I didn't want to take the chance of giving out info to an unofficial app that could cause future issues.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:44:26
Sadly doesn't appear so. The only exchange option I have is converting from one crypto to another.

Hmm... I have my wife's computer (RX 480) and my computer (Nvidia 1080) mine while idle and left on over night. Come out ahead on electricity usage.
Not subtracting the electric cost, I make about $80-100 on ETH a month/30 days. In the summer, the electric bill has not exceeded $125 (roughly) since I got the apartment 5 years ago. If anything, my electric bill might have gone up around $10-15 a month because of the computers left on over night.
If I had started, even on a different alt-coin, I doubt bitcoin would have been profitable enough(?), a year or two sooner, we would have saved up enough money on mining alone for our, late, honeymoon trip coming up soon.

Oklahoma here. I've checked my settings. I don't see where the option for state is, or how it's detecting my location. I assume through my browser or IP, but that is easy to spoof.

Rommate is paid on the weeks I don't get paid. I was last week, he's this week. lol
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:32:05
Hopefully roommate pays his rent this week. His work screwed him over on PTO and Workmans comp last pay period.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:47:49
Yeah... first issue is having a IRL friend that has coinbase. Then with an approved bank. Trust is a third, but that varies on a person level of understanding and loyalty between friends.

At the beginning of the year, when bitcoin was bouncing around $1k, it took me nearly two weeks to verify myself, and many picture retakes because my front camera was shit. They couldn't confirm the ID I was holding was the same card I did a close up on.
Then when my GS5 bricked itself after a samsung update, I didn't bother to get on CEX for somewhere around 4 months. Two factor with Authy. It took nearly 4 weeks to verify myself to regain access.
Then found out, and I had no email informing me, that my bid for $100 worth didn't get accepted and was declined. I'm sure that would have been a great increase. I managed to finally get in around $11K finally.
For the most part, I know I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:56:47
In the rare cases my personal bank card is not an option, and obviously btc isn't accepted, I've been using swift. Though, a charge of $10 when pulling $100 worth out hits hard. -_-
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:59:15
I would contact your bank and find out where the $100 is being pulled from. Such as the company name. If it's from Coinbase, either you, or they though unlikely(?), made a mistake and pulled $100 from your account.
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:38:56
I recall in January, my nvidia 1080 was making around $6 a day, after electricity. Now its barely $0.30 a day. lol..?
Note: I was having my desktop mine when I'm not using it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:28:15
As I've been reading today, I can see why. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:56:45
Yeap, the machine needs to afford it's room and board basically.

I really wanted to, I truly did. But I was getting through college without any college loans. I've graduated college with no loans at least. I feel like either way, I came out ahead.
For those wondering, NW Oklahoma college. Not a big college. Tuition there is still going up last I checked...

On slower plans on suddenlink, there is limits. Faster speeds there isn't.

Correct me if I'm wrong in some point. I've seen content creators list their crypto receiving address to receive donations. If address reuse were to be blocked, what options do users wanting to have donation addresses have?
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:45:48
Most times, I see the address in the forum, or similar, signatures.
Also, the statement of "no static web pages" is false. There's many rural based companies with one, or very few, webpages of next to full static pages, or just a landing page of the company's location, a few images, and what they do.
@_date: 2019-10-15 18:59:10
You tell me.
Then tell me why ISPs think it's fine to increase the bill once or twice a year. I started at $60 for 100/7.5 4(?) Years ago, now paying $72.99.
Oh, want some humor and fun? Check out r/suddenlink. Since sept 1, their management software has caused a ton more issues for users.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:14:13
That's what I've always known. I've mostly been buying crypto. The only exception is what I've been snowballing on Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:58:15
I was coming to look for details on this. Loaded up my background tabs and saw this.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:38:40
Also the vague idea of a low priority miner running in the background. It's a possible event.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:55:42
All in all, it was fun. One quick tip though, Don't do in January, at least not out of Florida. Most times the highest deck was very windy, generally cold, and the ocean itself was, though many people liked it, a bit too cold for me. But, at times of the year for this, it was much cheaper.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:57:17
Considering it was my first vacation since college, and only one before during highschool with family. I'd like to enjoy life from time to time. I'm only off about $500-600.

I've been buying, and mining, a little here and there since around Aug. I'm currently around 5% of a bitcoin, buying the dips when I can afford them, and trying to sell a portion when hitting spikes. Currently waiting for that 12k mark again. BUT, the risk is, it can keep going up and up again, hence only selling a portion and not all.
Edit: Removal of an unintended space.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:54:12
Supply can also decrease due to lost coin/wallets.

Who says we're only aiming for the moon, or which moon for that matter? There's other planets with their own moons.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:56:24
I'm at .06 of a bitcoin thus far, between once or twice a month I buy around $100 when there's a spike drop. When it hits 12k or more, I'll be at positive, as I didn't really start getting in around that time last year.
For clarification, I had to sell a chunk back in January due to "extra" fees on our honeymoon trip. Never again am I doing Disney Cruise without an itemized listed of all expenses that will be expected at the end of the trip. If there is an option to use X service, I'm not concerned over being forwarned about that. It's the X needs to be covered, oh and there's a minimum 20% on top for tips. Wound up spending around $350 in fees I swore was never mentioned, or was told was covered prior, but wasn't. /r

That and transactions from NiceHash to ConBase is free and instant. (Yes I'm a beginner.) I used two or three other exchanges, and dropped them due to US changes (no longer accepting withdrawls to banks or cards, and loss of Paypal, or increased charges of using PayPal) HIGH requirements for withdrawing, buying, transferring, and selling. I don't have thousands to spend to meet the requirements they have, such as CEX has gotten to be,
