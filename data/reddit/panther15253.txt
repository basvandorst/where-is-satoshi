Funny how time can change your thinking also. College does seem like such a waste of resources. Such a racket. My middle daughter is a really great artist. Loves anime (Sailor Moon, Pokémon, Etc) Sits and draws for hours. She just started using adobe animate to create animations for her YouTube channel. The internet and technology is amazing. She may not need college by the time she gets to be 18. Lol.

True. It just depends if you are looking correctly at which is the 100 and which is the 1.  Trillions of debt and quadrillion’s of derivative debt might make you rethink the odds. Maybe even switch them.

You gamble everyday by owning assets that can be inflated to $0. People calling owning bitcoin gambling is ridiculously hilarious. Should I have bought gold? Real Estate? Kept it in dollars? Stock Market? Everyone loves to come up with the gambling comments without any discussion of fundamentals.

Bitcoin can be used for many things other than gambling. Even speculating on bitcoin isn’t true gambling as your speculation can be hedged in a manner thats alleviates part of the risk.

Wrong. I put 3.75% of what it would roughly cost for my kids to go to college in an asset that can only be classified as risky if you are uneducated about fractional reserve banking and our current debt situation. One day, the world will look back and ask why so many people took so much risk by waiting so long to get rid of their debt ridden fiat. Mark my word. Take a screen shot of this.

Traditionally, investors have not piled in to volatile investments during currency crises. However, the past is no indication of the future. When the entire global fiat central banking system is exposed for what it is and the curtain is pulled off the banksters on a worldwide, trust in fiat will be destroyed. BTC will be of infinite value as it is trustless, finite, and easily transferable across the planet. If there is no crisis, I expect money printing to continue and interest rates to remain low to infinity thus destroying the value of central bank controlled fiat currencies across the globe. It is only a matter of time. Call me a moron all you would like. The risk reward ratios for Bitcoin warrant it. My comment was intended to illustrate the potential return that may be possible if it gains wide adoption. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:11:56
Not my only options, but with stocks and bonds denominated in dollars backed by 20 trillion in debt, I fully expect by the time I will begin to draw down on funds, we will have experienced a currency crisis or major inflation. We have hit the point of no return. Even if stocks, bonds etc, continue to climb, the value of the dollar in relation to goods and services will continue to diminish wiping out any potential gains that I might see. The risk of currency crisis wealth confiscation schemes doesn't  help me sleep at night either. Most assets are digital now and can be confiscated by mandate and keystroke. I have investments other than BTC, but deem this investment, because of the time frame and risk reward ratio, to be quite an opportunity. My oldest daughter is twelve years old. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 06:44:28
Let's transfer that delusion level to BTC $9000 a coin. May be delusional, but then again, if I am right, I estimate about $3750 at current prices should provide a good education. Not a large price to pay for the risk. That is also assuming BTC goes to zero. I can always hold down to $100 and get out and therefore only be risking $2750. Seems like a fine bet to me. BTC isn't a slot machine that only provides 10 minutes of fun. It has real utility. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 06:24:41
I tend to agree with you on this point expect with the return I expect, it will not take a lot of fiat at these BTC prices to provide for their education. The other dollars not invested will be invested in precious metals and real estate.

A while back, I started using 1password to store all of my passwords including my banking passwords. In the process of loading all my passwords into 1password, I realized how idiotic it was to be putting all my passwords in one digital location assuming that there could be some back door in the software that could give a hacker access to all my info. I had briefly uploaded all my passwords and quickly changed all my passwords when I realized my mistake. Within 24 hrs of using 1password, I began getting notifications from my bank that my online access was suspended due to attempted access to my account using the wrong password. Wheeeew! That was a close one. I would not advise using 1password for storage of any passwords, especially now that I know there are compromised copies of 1password floating around the internet. You may have downloaded and used a compromised version.
