Depends which money, right? For example, if you're living in a country where government has hyperinflated your currency by increasing the money supply, or is at risk of doing so, it becomes hard to plan for the future, since your currency holdings rapidly lose purchasing power.

One answer to your question about what to tell others is to think about centralization. Because of BTC's structure, lack of pre-mining and the fact it was the first into this space, BTC is by far the most decentralized major cryptocurrency. Nodes are running all over the world and this has created a highly secure network that has never been hacked. By contrast, when [Ethereum got hacked]( it ultimately *rolled back ETH transactions*, which showcases just how different (and centralized) it is compared to BTC. ETH founder, Vitalik, even promises to throw countries or their leaders off of the ETH network if they "do evil". Do you want a crypto where one person (Vitalik) gets to decide what it means to "do evil" and which transactions don't get to go through as a result?
Like ETH, many of BTC's competitors are centralized, which means there are fewer pressure points to be exploited by hostile actors. The CEO or founder could exit-scam, or release all the coins in escrow, or a nation-state could bribe/blackmail the person/ppl in charge into making changes to the protocol that benefit them, etc. With Bitcoin, there's no one in charge. There's no one person or hardware that it's too reliant upon. There are fewer pressure points, which makes it far more secure.
Have you read through [lopp's BTC resources]( They may help answer some of your other questions, since at this stage your questions seem pretty general.

Krugman tweets about bitcoin [all the time]( each time negatively. He's bearish on Bitcoin just like he was [bearish on the Internet]( -- predicting that "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."

The big idea is that BTC will enable all sorts of new protocols (payment and otherwise) that layer on top of it. It'd be a waste of energy for every node to record every single cup of coffee on-chain. BTC acts as a secure layer for settlement. Innovation in this space is just getting started!

No. Monero is not illegal. This regulation is about deposits/withdrawals to/from exchanges--not about the privacy offered by any particular cryptocurrency traded on them.

Lol, check out totally normal market fluctuations like this [237 Bitcoin \($3.5 million\) sell wall]( at the totally normal number of $14,960 yesterday. Once it got close, the wall disappeared. Totally normal!

"all governments utilize bitcoin" ≠ "fiat currency is no more." Here's a paper from the Bank of Canada explaining how a Bitcoin Standard works:

There's no evidence for it ending after 2018. I used it as a date by which you could measure 1yr performance (Dec 2017 - Dec 2018).

This isn't true -- neither Coinbase nor Paypal offers a Lightning-enabled wallet, so it's not "much faster" than Bluewallet. I understand you're trying to make a point about custody, but sloppy comments like this are confusing to newbies and not helpful. If someone has never used LN before, Bluewallet is one of the easiest ways for them to try it out and the user experience speaks for itself -- they "loved it" enough to post here. If you want to advise someone on how to self-custody their own LN wallet, that'd be a positive contribution :)

My advice, FWIW: consider taking a deep breath, doing some research, and weighing the question: have any of BTC's underlying fundamentals changed? If not, then it's approximately as sound an investment now as it was then. You thought it was a sound investment then! So you might consider that despite 2-week downtrend it's still a sound investment now. As others have noted, there is likely going to be volatility between now and Dec 2018. That's part of the nature of this investment. If you've invested more than you're willing to lose--and you're panicking--you can always take the loss, w/no shame in that. But if "taking the loss" means you're going to keep checking the price and beating yourself up if it goes back up, then there's a cost to that too. If you're worried about sitting tight, just know there's a lot of people sitting tight and  with you. Wishing you well and a Happy New Year!

Sure, here's a snapshot of the page from Dec 13, 2017: 
Here's a [screenshot]( of the relevant section.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:43
Here's your proof. In the future consider doing better research.
Here's [a screenshot]( and a link to the archived page as snapshotted on Dec 13, 2017:  Not a fake.

No, it's not fake, and it's not a good look on you to lie. Here's a snapshot of the page from Dec 13, 2017:

buying bitcoin is investing. by purchasing bitcoin you invest in the bitcoin ecosystem (i.e. all the products services protocols that use bitcoin, like the lightning network). by making bitcoin more valuable (w your purchase) you increase the incentive for programmers to work on bitcoin.

Apology accepted. FWIW there's a big difference between "doubt" (healthy skepticism) and calling something "fake" (which says you know it to be false). You didn't know, but said you did, so you lied. Hoping we can do better on this sub.

I assume you're buying thru Coinbase direct from your bank, but a better option for purchasing $3k at once is to deposit that into your Coinbase USD wallet via bank wire. That'll arrive between a few hours and a few days, and then you can use the $3k all at once (using Coinbase or GDAX to purchase). Good luck!

It wasn't "obvious" from the [roadmap]( they published 4 days ago. 
*edit* here's a cached version of their website where the roadmap was posted until Coinbase changed it without notice just before launching BCH: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:46
CB said they were adding [support for BCH withdrawals]( by Jan 1--not BCH buy/sell/deposit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:08
No, they didn't. They said they were going to [allow BCH withdrawals]( on Jan 1--not buy/sell/deposit.

Can you explain your reasoning here? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:07
I'm surprised no one has tried to answer your question! Probably because it's more complicated than it looks and no one is really sure about the "right" amount of national debt. Sorry your school didn't teach this. One way you might learn a little more is reading this 2009 NPR article, *[National Debt for Beginners]( Here's an excerpt explaining just some of what's at stake:






Hope that's helpful :)

I think that's a good approach. Hopefully people bought Bitcoin because of its underlying fundamental attributes, not just because of its price, which is and has been volatile. My check-in is basically, "have any of Bitcoin's fundamentals changed?" If they have not, HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:12:34
well, what do you think?
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:07:05
but even in his apology he's still linking people to Bitcoin.com, which is the very site trying to push the "Bitcoin Cash" vs. "Bitcoin Core" scam!
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:51:01
but then it's not much of an apology, if he's still sending customers to the very people he's accusing of attacking Bitcoin in a "sneaky and illegitimate way."
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:19:28
Did they fix it? They changed their tweet, but so far they're leaving up the other stuff, like their [YouTube video on how to "Exchange Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Cash"]( 
EDIT: appears they've now deleted this video, good on them. But the fact they had this thing ready to go, complete with "Bitcoin Cash" vs. "Bitcoin Core," shows the tweet wasn't some slip-of-the-finger. Looks like they didn't expect this kind of backlash.
