You don't have to believe what you've been told. Multiple coins now have Segwit enabled without an issue. 2nd layer solutions are being tested on them right now. These are exciting times.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:34:57
I think we have enough miner centralisation right now. Too much in fact. Just increasing the block size i--- oh forget it. I know you won't bother reading this. The arguments for Segwit have been made, it's already live on other coins and in 6 months time it'll really start to prove it's worth. The fact that litecoin and vertcoin have had massive price spikes when Segwit locked in shows that the economic majority want it, the developers want it, the majority of users want it. Bitcoin could easily beat $3k a coin if Segwit locked in today. 
Instead progress is blocked by those who want to sabotage bitcoin for their own short term purposes. Oh well.

That's funny, claims, and I quote, "The economic majority supports BIP148.". Yet every time I ask for clarification I get downvoted and ignored. In the mean time, this sub is constantly getting hammered with pro BIP148 posts on a daily basis.
It pains me to say it, but this sub is rapidly turning into another where all sanity is rapidly leaving the sub, being replaced with a small amount of very vocal rabbit fanbois that don't allow dissenting voices or alternative opinions, or just rational thought.
This post and this comment being the top voted comment does give a glimmer of hope that I'm wrong. I hope I'm wrong.

It will drop off after a few days and will be 'returned' to you.
You might want to consider getting a better wallet in the long term. Your wallet software is doing a poor job of calculating fees if it thinks 11 sat/byte is 'normal' fees in the current climate. If your current wallet can expose the private key you can use that to use another wallet to 'sweep' the money into it and ditch the old wallet that's doing you no favours.

That's great. Maybe if he could be so kind as to enlighten us with that data it might help his viewpoint and convince some of us to actually run BIP148 nodes. 
As it stands saying such bold statements without backing them up just makes him look like a liar and destroys his credibility. 
Unless I'm convinced that the actual economic majority supports BIP148 then my uacomment setting will be removed before August and I won't be running an enforcing node.

Such as Luke claiming BIP148 has economic majority support but failing to provide any evidence for that blatantly untrue claim despite me repeatedly asking for evidence.
Makes you ponder the integrity of the wider core developers, even if it is just one person.

OP, Contact Coinbase, give them a week to sort it (I guarantee they won't), then complain to your bank/credit card/whatever.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:59:40
Well, if using that card, sure. I put around £100 on that card when I first got it to dip my toe. I got around £130 of stuff from it before I had to top it up again. So you can look at it as a way of actually taking advantage when Bitcoin is being it's usual violate self; spend on the card when the price is high.
Let's look at it another way, what you **gain** is your money not being inflated away next time Mr President wants to start another war or bail out 'too big to fail' industries. You *now have the choice* to opt out of a system that nearly brought the world crashing down in 2008, leaving us with a decade of recession and stagnant growth and eye watering national debt.
If I do an hours work, and earn, say, £10. I keep that £10 note in my pocket for a year. Why is my money now worth £9.83 the next year? It still says £10 on it, why doesn't it buy the same amount of stuff as it did 12 months ago? Did I suddenly do less work and I misremember it? Why is my hour of work suddenly worth less? How is that just? [The bank of England even give me a tool to tell me how my money is being inflated away]( although the way the site works you'd be forgiven for thinking your money is worth *more* in subsequent years.
Wherever possible and practical, I use Bitcoin to transact, even if it sometimes costs a little more. I opt out of a system which I see as fundamentally flawed, working against me and, now that I have at least a small understanding of how it works, I will never trust again.
But if you want, you can drink beer instead. Up to you.

Imagine Coinbase went pop tomorrow and there is no chance of getting your coins out. How would you feel? Get those coins into your own wallet, such as Electrum. Remember, if you don't have your private keys, **it's not your Bitcoin, it's just an IOU** currently Coinbase has your private keys (and won't give them to you). This is fine for newbies but as soon as it hits the "I'd lose sleep if I lost this" amounts, then move that coin out pronto.
If you have a significant amount, I strongly suggest getting a Ledger Nano S or Trezor or something. (I personally prefer the Ledger, it supports both Ethereum and Bitcoin as well as Litecoin). This does a better job of securing your private keys. Even if you *don't* yet have significant amounts invested just yet, order one anyway. There is a massive delay on them due to a surge in demand, and if you're doing this long term, then order it now if possible.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:45:35
BIP148 changes the consensus rules by rejecting non-segwit signaling blocks which are currently accepted by the network, and does so at a point in time, ignoring any type of consensus, economic or otherwise. This is directly against the rule as I'm interpreting it.
BIP148 without any type of consensus, which as I understand it is how it exists now, is reckless and will do nothing but produce a worthless chain with exceptionally slow confirmation times.
Will be fun to watch though.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:00:20
My node is signalling as well, through uacomment.
I'm almost certain to remove that setting as the uasf.co website states that we should only be running this software if there is consensus, and I agree. But I am unable to find any evidence there is any consensus at all.
And despite me asking Luke-jr *twice* to provide evidence that there is any consensus at all (a claim he is asserting whenever he gets the chance), he just ignores my requests. Honestly I think he's outright lying about this inconvenient truth at this point as he simply wants BIP148 and anything that gets in the way of that is simply ignored.
He's pretty much destroyed all creditability with me now, not that any of that matters to him (and indeed, why should it...). But I'm not going to blindly follow a Core developer just because 'he says it is so'.
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:55:29
You told me that the economic majority already supports BIP148. [When I asked for a source for that claim I was ignored](
Now you're saying more businesses and users need to support it for it to be included in Core.
These statements appear to be at odds with each other.
For full disclosure, I'm running a uacomment node, but will probably remove the uacomment setting before August 1st if it's clear that there isn't a majority supporting it, as instructed by the usaf website.
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:33:56
Good point. That recovery seed is probably the thing you should keep in the safety deposit box, rather than the hardware wallet. If the hardware wallet fails or gets damaged or something, that recovery seed will be what gets you all your coins back.

With respect, bollocks. 
Rule 5 is **constantly** broken in this sub every time the rabbit fanbois post yet again why I should be running a BIP148 enforcing node. I've yet to see a single ban or removal of these posts.
Rule 5 is basically "don't promote software we don't like" but everyone is too cowardly to admit it or speak honestly about it. 
With that action this sub completely losses it's legitimacy. The sub should enforce the rules consistently and properly, adjusting the rules if necessary as things evolve instead of selectively enforcing the rules for viewpoints the mods simply don't like.

Set up a wallet on your computer, and send the money to the address the wallet gives you. Electrum is a popular choice. You'll lose a little with transaction fees, but sending money to yourself is the safest way to give Bitcoin a "test drive".
For the love of God back up the recovery seed it gives you. If your computer fails or the wallet file becomes corrupt you'll be in a world of hurt without that recovery seed.

Thank you for your condescending explanation.
The UASF will fail, but people will continue to run it, and we'll end up with two chains, both claiming to be 'Bitcoin' as nobody will give up stake to the name. In the run up to August this sub will be unusable as the entire front page will be locked out with UASF posts from the vocal minority. Why you've decided to go off on this tangent is beyond me.
This doesn't at all invalidate my original point that rule 5 is being broken on a daily basis here and nobody seems to care.
Promoting BIP148 software is a clear breach of that rule. A rule which was used to great effect to suppress any discussion on Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited for *years* in this sub, made worse as those nodes only changed anything once a consensus was reached through miner signaling whilst BIP148 just picks a date and changes the rules. If the rule and the same logic applies to those clients, it should absolutely apply to the BIP148 node as well which doesn't even give any credence to consensus at all, but apparently it's okay for some reason.

@_date: 2017-06-24 21:38:10
Hold on... you said "send to ledger", sorry, I missed that.
Just ask the ledger software for the 'receive' address, and send the Bitcoin there. Basically the same as the process I describe, but use the ledger software instead of Electrum. Although Electrum will work with the ledger if you want, it's completely personal preference. I actually use both the ledger chrome extension and Electrum, depending on which computer I'm sitting at.

A good rule if you see Bitcoin as nothing more than an investment vehicle to help boost your net worth. Many do this and there is nothing wrong with that.
If you're going to invest a sizeable amount over time, consider a hardware wallet or cold storage solutions. I can personally recommend the Ledger Nano S, as I own one, although it's out of stock currently.
But at least spend a little bit of time trying to look a level beyond 'this will make me money'. Try to research a little as to *why* Bitcoin exists at all. *Why* Satoshi published his/her/their white paper just after the 2008 economic crisis, *why* some of us are sick of being made poorer each year by governments printing more and more money, inflating away our wealth, *why* some of us are deeply concerned with runaway government debt and *why* some of us see pieces of paper with dead people printed on them don't have worth; they are bits of paper with dead people on them and more can be printed at any time.
A good light starting point, believe it or not, is this  - And when the penny drops, and you realise "holy shit, this is a comedy sketch but it's actually *accurate* to how shit works right now". Then look at what's happened in 2008, in Greece, in Venezuela right now. Then you'll really get the *why*, and you'll maybe want to actually start using Bitcoin daily, maybe.
Or just keep making mad gainz on your fiat wealth, up to you! :)
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:04:58




So I politely ask you a *second* time to provide the source for your claims. So far I see nothing that tells me the economic majority supports BIP148.


Yes, yes it has:




So yet again, no economic majority, no way am I knowingly contributing to a pointless chain split.
At this point, Luke, with you constantly dodging the question, I'm beginning to believe you are simply lying with your economic majority line. If you want BIP148 for other idealistic reasons, that's fine, but pushing this notion that the economic majority supports it when I can find no evidence of this is immoral.
At this point nobody has been able to provide decent evidence that the economic majority supports BIP148. Twitter polls and Reddit posts do not signify the economic majority.
My current position is to drop the uacomment setting before 1st August unless I see real tangible evidence of majority support. I suspect there are plenty of others like me, but they are simply part of the exceptionally vocal minority on this subreddit.
