Dude I sold at € 0,74 :D - got 400 and 350€ and thought I'm the African Prince now. My Gf by that time who had a MBA told me its the stupidest thing she ever heard and its worthless and a scam. I was mining bitcoin on my gaming PC on slushs pool....good times. Mining was the funniest part

Well, BTC atm is all about scamming people and extract as many USD from the market as possible. There are very few people I've heard of, who use BTC for other things than profit.

I contacted support. They told me the transaction was correct and they take the price of btc from blablabla....
So I got it confirmed: they charged 10,5€ on a 6,5€ Pizza. My total was 0,0393 BTC which is 17,57€ average 1 Day later.
