Very interesting, thank you for sharing this information.

Not sure unfortunately.

Fair, should have labeled it layer 1 trading volume eh?
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:50:18
How have these transactions been removed? 
Additionally, if these have been removed as you claim shouldn't a modest 8% decrease mean meaningful growth in non-institutional usage of bitcoin considering the % of total tx volume represented by the market participants you mention is much greater than 8%? 
Edit: How much volume does liquid do on a daily basis?

Any self-published data?

For sure, tho likely not much more than a few billion $. LN should lead Layer 2+ growth into the hundreds of billions, if not trillions, within a couple years.

Could you explain how that is that suggested?

For sure, maybe even a beef patty and some garlic knots as well.

If a fee is paid it's a valid transaction.
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:25:01
Interesting. Do you possibly know of any studies on LN tx volume?
@_date: 2019-01-20 00:53:37
It's a good starting point for sure.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:37:14
Because the entire world economy is currently denominated in fiat.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:57:39
It's the latter, but regardless correlation to price doesn't indicate flow being " mostly just in and out of exchanges, " ya?
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:12:56
Somewhere between USD and EUR %s would be my guess.

With all due respect, Apple is no Goldman Sachs.
