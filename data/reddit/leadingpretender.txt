Sorry to be a n00b, but if you shouldn't keep them on an exchange where should you keep them? 
Is this the bit where having a "wallet" on your hard-drive comes in to play? I'm just getting the hang of everything, looking at FAQs and stuff but you seemed knowledgable so I thought I'd ask. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:06:24
Ahh ok! I figured that a rise like this couldn't be sustainable, so that I'd give it 2 - 4 weeks before I really went for it. 
What are you doing on Malta?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:44:27
People should have bought before $200, after that it was just risky. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:17:41
Yeah I always forget that you can buy less than a whole unit of a coin, like buying £0.10 which is just 10p.
There isn't a properly defined unit of less than 1 is there? Like a MiniBit, or something?

Oh my. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:11:38
My God this subreddit is smug haha
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:35:07
Ahh cool.
So if I live in Europe, where would be the best shout to buy BitCoin? And when I buy it, does it automatically generate a wallet.dat file for me?
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:22:18
I was merely wondering!
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:07:23
Thanks, this is great, so much helpful information. I'm really grateful.
The best of luck with your endeavours! I think I'll wait a little while before I truly get involved even if the price goes up. It all seems like a lot of work  buying the BTC and I think the fact that I live in Malta but have an English bank account might complicate matters though.

Wait, OP's link shows $150,000,000 worth of BTC being transferred out of one account? I'm new to this, sorry!
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:11:53
Are there really that many places that accept BitCoin? I didn't think it was widespread enough? 
Also, you bought 900 Bitcoin for $1 in TOTAL or $1 a pop (so $900)?
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:04:50
800 BTC is about £165,000 at current rates, right?
I'm new to bitcoin and just trying to wrap my head around exchange rates right now.

Ahh wicked post, thanks mate, I really appreciate it!
I'll definitely refer back to this post and give you a shout if I have any further questions.
It's all fairly overwhelming and the way you first described buying bitcoins seems SO convoluted and drawn out haha I can see that being massively off putting to a lot of people. The link you sent seems much more direct. 
When you make a transaction online, how do you get actually get the BitCoins? Does the site make a Wallet for you? Is your wallet/"account" with that website? How do you store them offline instead?
Sorry for the twenty questions haha! I just really want to be a part of something in it's early stages :) 
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:57:23
Aaaaaand that's why people don't believe in BitCoin outside of Fuck. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:19:03
Wow this is crazy! I wonder how long BitCoin can sustain this kind of spike for/when it'll level out. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:29:23
Are you fucking serious?
Were people this deluded?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:59:41
Ahhh that's investment for you! It could all come crashing down in a week or it could hit $1,000 in 2 weeks. 
Hot diggity. Shame I nevr heard about BitCoin until now, but that can't be helped!
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:39:44
Ahh brilliant, many thanks.
I'm looking into getting involved in BitCoin, but I'm still in the learning stage and trying to wrap my head around it! 
Seeing a site lose 4,000 BTC in a hack attack doesn't do wonders to allay any fears or mistrust one might have but then again there's very little doubt in my mind that BitCoin has a massive future ahead of it and will in many ways become integral to society in the next decade given our reliance on the internet and speedy transactions.
