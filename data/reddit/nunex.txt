it's gonna be 1337 dollars in a few years.

Yeah. But if it's gonna cost so much to mine, what will be the incentive if the price doesn't go up too? They will be losing money. We have to assume the price goes up or the whole thing goes down.

Someone did that research for me, that's what the graph indicates.
I have 0.5 btc now, if i trade it for fiat now I risk losing that. 
Better DCA instead and go for the long, I think it's better.

that's why i'm buying €1000 euros of it every month, as a long term investment. I don't care about the satoshis I'm buying, just want to stack them.

We should sell now and buy in the end of 2019, is that it?

That's cool if you can predict the highs and lows, but you can't.

You could be doing DCA, which in that case every week is a good week to buy some.

Thanks for the support, internet stranger. Even though I'm well informed about the technology and vision regarding the libertarian movement that BTC promotes, I'm not well versed in investment.
Psychologically speaking, it kinda matters that my decision is somewhat supported by even a single unknown entity.
Therefore, kudos to you.
Long live Nick Szabo. Rip Hal Finney.

what does that mean?

Is this a good time to buy like €500 in BTC? I have a lot of other altcoins, but never really bought BTC.
