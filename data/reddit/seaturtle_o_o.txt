Here are some things to keep in mind for the future ; cryptocurrency’s are harder to tax, easy to transfer, small fees for large amount of value, faster to send around the world, harder to steal, borderless money.
You actually want bitcoin to be volatile, especially vs fiat. When you use the term volatile you need to think volatile against what? The US dollar in this case, if you zoom out and look over the last years, on a log chart, this volatility har been upwards. Bitcoin cannot go from 1$ to be the global digital store value standard-currency without volatility.
All of this combined will make bitcoin incredibly big in the future . I’m not here to make a quick buck an switch back to fiat money as soon as my portfolio gets bigger. I’m really behind the technology and want control of my own store of value. Don’t be stupid and sell on the dip, bitcoin is here to stay

Just about a month ago some guy in Norway was killed over his bitcoins, people have been tortured to gain access to accounts. Never ever tell anyone that or ask that question, it’s the same as asking a random person how much money they have in his/hers account. Don’t be foolish and go around telling everyone that you invest in btc or other altcoins.
The only person that knows that I have invested in btc is my wife. I have taught her how to manage my hard wallet in case something happens to me. 
Don’t take this comment as criticism but rather as advice, be safe my dude

Right? Imo this sub is getting worse by the day. If you don’t have the right mindset and never expect it to be volatile then you’re in for a surprise.

I’m in the same boat with you on this, the calm before the storm...

It’s called a relief rally

If you educate yourself on the last major drop you would know that the price dropped about 85-87 %. This is no surprise to the people who pay attention, personally waiting for it to drop to 3000$. Then I can get some more coins

I can agree on that, hope that this year bitcoin makes some more headlines and better quality articles 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:28:33
Yo have to remember that not everyone knows about bitcoin, this is catering to the general public, not like us that are into the space:) but I can agree on your opinion that it isn’t a deep article

My bad, not the entire year, I first got in in March, prices were stable, not much happening thats all. Just accumulating small amounts from time to time.  Have a nice day fellow bitcoiner!:)
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:12:35
I call for 1200

In the same boat, just adding to my portfolio, finally something is happening, been boring for almost a year now
