Other exchanges are having a really hard time with all the new volume too, plus Coinbase is one of the most noobie-friendly sites out there.  There's just a lot more demand in their site now

They specifically do not since Trump clarified this in the new tax law

Not only does the github link redirect to the original site, all of the social media links do. Zero team information.
Projects like this that don't open-source their code or provide external audits are synonymous with scam. I don't care what the true intention is, their history of service, or anything if I can't either hold people accountable or have proof that I won't need to.

It sounds like you don't realize that the 21 million mark happens over 100 years from now.

Well, basic supply and demand economics would say that a decrease in supply with a steady, increased, or *less* decreased demand will increase price..

You've done a great job of providing a useful comment yourself.

You can't buy much higher than a new ATH, so you're right on track to lose money as fast as you can.
It will probably go higher though, eventually.

Well I read through your post and this comment thread, and I'm not really sure how much I can help.
Like I said in a comment on another thread that's quoted above, blockchain =/= voting platform by default.  You have to address a few things:
* Fees.  Using a distributed ledger means using other people's processing power, storage, and network bandwidth. So you have to pay for their hardware and electrical costs in the form of transaction fees.  Who pays the fees in your application?  At the moment, many blockchains require the sender to pay, not the receiver.  Blockchains are also *extremely* expensive to be storing lots of data on.  Think hundreds of thousads/millions per **gigabyte** of data.
* Identity.  How do you guarantee anonymity whilst preventing fraud in the form of double / stolen votes?  Who manages this system?  Does it account for metadata that can be used to determine identity?
* Accessibility.  How will the dumbest potential user actually use this platform?  You cannot ask for people to understand cryptography, blockchain, or any technical aspect of the platform (this includes security measures).   
* Security.  How will you prove that the platform is secure and able to be patched if/when vulnerabilities are found?  This becomes difficult on blockchain because of it's immutable nature.
There are solutions to all of these, but I don't know of anything that address all or even most of them at once.  The best platform to look at is going to be Ethereum at the moment, but some of the needed features have yet to be implemented (like allowing arbitrary parties to pay network fees).
