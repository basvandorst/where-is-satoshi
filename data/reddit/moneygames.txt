The main reason is that increasing the block size represents a [hard fork]( The same devs are generally against most hard forks, since any hard fork violates the basic assumption of the blockchain being a singular immutable ledger of transactions of one unified unit of exchange. 
The argument against the blocksize increase is that a hardfork is a huge cost to pay for a small gain in scalability. Bitcoins scalabiltiy problem is a much bigger issue than can be dealt with by tweaking the block size, and there are alternative soft approaches that basically involve many off-chain transactions. For example SegWit is a soft fork so it maintains continuity with the original blockchain while also arguably providing a better scalability solution. You can read more about the scalability considerations here:

To do what OP described with $4000 , using say Bitstamp, he would have to pay about $34 dollars in fees. Just eyeballing the current orderbook, he would probably lose another $30-$40 on the spread. Overall that is close to 2%. There is also some risk involved related to changes in price during the time between getting in and out of Bitcoin, as OP mentioned. 2% exchange fee with some short volatility exposure is probably better than a lot of services, but it is not as good as you claim.

You might as well ask why statists support the internet if it allows the sharing of information in a way that is resistant to state control, and list various other inherent anti-state properties of the internet.
You could also ask libertarian statists why they invest in gold coins if they also support the existence of a government. I am pretty sure a majority of early Bitcoin users are libertarian statists,(not anarchists) so you should have started asking them these ridiculous questions a couple years ago.

Depending on how "pull a Rosa Parks" is interpreted, you may be the one initiating aggression and aggression against you may be legitimate. From an anarcho-capitalist perspective, if an agent of the owner of a bus asks you to change seats or leave the bus, you are committing aggression by failing to comply. Using violence to remove you from the bus can be seen as being in agreement with the non-aggression principle.
Your argument that state aggression is never legitimate appears to be based on analogies and circular reasoning, basically you claim that states are illegitimate because they use illegitimate aggression, and their aggression is illegitimate because states are illegitimate.
Obviously in your world view there are many examples of legitimate and illegitimate aggression, and a very complex ethical theory is required to demarcate them. To pretend that a few sentences and analogies are enough to describe this ethical theory is completely delusional. The idea that your view is not based upon a nonobvious complex ethical theory is also completely delusional.

I think Satoshi himself made a comment predicting an early phase where BTC is primarily used as a speculative commodity which later leads into wider adoption as a transaction medium. What he said was not quite so specific, but the impression I always got was that interest and price being driven up by greedy investors treating it like a commodity was always kind of part of the plan.
In any given market, greedy participants contribute to stuff like price discovery and market liquidity, and increased participation, greedy or not, is generally thought to be a positive thing. 
I think perhaps you are just fine with greedy speculators who are primarily responsible for getting the price to where it is, but you are just telling them not to sell but to keep buying because... well I think it might have something to do with greed veiled in ideology.

Well put. A lot of people seem to have no sense of scale in regards to how far altcoins are from Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency design space. 
I think people make the mistake of getting their sense of scale by just looking at the differences between Bitcoin and various altcoins and trying to judge which altcoins are most novel on these tiny scales in design space. Adding say bit gold and other Bitcoin precursors to this perspective makes one realize that current alt coins cluster right around Bitcoin and are essentially copies with much less valuable networks.

SHA-2 is a pretty conise algorithm that is widely studied, it's not really possible for there to be a "backdoor" in the typical sense. Worst case scenario is that there is some very subtle vulnerability to certain kinds of attacks like SHA-1 had. It would be quite a feat to intentionally add such a subtle vulnerability going from SHA-1 to SHA-2 while that same modification constitutes a parsimonious answer to the problem with SHA-1.(Unless maybe they made SHA-1 with the same vulnerability, and only correctes one problem with SHA-1 because it was discovered.) It's not impossible but it is a very ridiculous scenario to imagine. It seems far more likely that if a serious vulnerability existed, it would not be by design.

Oh, interesting. That is a much simpler idea with the same goal, but I don't think it can accomplish the same outcome. 
In my opinion the effect of the described demurrage is not all that different than a scenario where coins continue to be mined at a certain percentage per year indefinitely.
A small open-loop demurrage rate will certainly add an inflationary tendency, but changes in velocity of money,population, goods, currency adoption, etc will likely cause price inflation/deflation rates to diverge from original intentions. I don't believe that the correct course of the money supply can be "dead reckoned", and it is clear that Milton Friedman also believed that active feedback on the money supply was necessary. In his case he clearly thought that an intelligent central regulator was required.

No. Fractions of bits are used all the time in information theory, a common example being measurements of [shannon entropy]( 
Perhaps an even more obvious example, someone could ask something like "how many bits of information on average are stored in a square millimeter of a QR code"? Or "how many bits can be transmitted over USB in one nanosecond on average?" Clearly the answers here do not have to be integer values.
Finally, please visit the wikipedia article ["Bit"]( and search for "millibit".

I prefer hectokilosatoshis but I can settle for the 4060millibits of informatic entropy provided in the string posted by you above.

The "naive" concept was to have the network intelligently scrape databases and the web for consumer price indices and exchange rates and things like that. The problems with that are that it could be gamed by people manipulating data, also there would be no easy way to force participants to actually run this scraping aspects from the client unless there is a solid way to make it impossible to mine without also using some of the computing power to run this scraping algorithm.
The other concepts had to do with determining changes in the coins value by allowing users to essentially trade past and future coins, which has direct implications about the current rate of change in the value of the coins. This method may have accumulating random error with respect to an absolute CPI, but the relative change in value would should be slow and unpredictable.

I don't think you know what inflation is.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:51:45
It is strange to me how people keep asking about "intrinsic value" in relation to Bitcoin. I have even heard confident talk about the lack of "intrinsic value" this from friends and associates who don't know much about economics or finance.
I have a hard time understanding what these people mean by that. It's like their thought process is "I can see why people might find that useful if it facilitates monetary transactions faster and cheaper that existing solutions, but they really shouldn't use it because while it may be really useful and create positive utility, the denominations it involves don't have any intrinistic value." 
The basic value questions in my mind surround how one predicts self-interested rational agents will behave when given access a certain kind of currency innovation in the context of different markets, which depends on an understanding of the properties of these rational agents and the properties of the innovation. 
It's like people natively have this complicated essentialist belief system surrounding economics and finance even though they otherwise don't study or care about them.
In any case if "intrinsic value" is something more than an essential property of a security which is a prerequisite for buying said item for those in the know regarding its metaphysical status, you might find such information by looking up the definition of the term. Oh look, wikipedia gives a good definition of [intrinsic value]( in relation to various securities, but not in relation to currencies. Hmm but if you look at [Fiat Money](  it says that Fiat money has no intrinsic value by definition!(Oh craP!)
Oh my god I have been buying things with fiat money my whole life!! This must mean that the goods I bought using intrinistic-valueless money must have been stripped of intrinsic value themselves!(Due to the self-evident metaphysical principle of market efficiency and value conservation of transactions in relation to intrinsic value) So all that food I have been eating, and my extension my own body which is composed of said food, have lost all intrinsic value! God damnit Nixon I used to have an intrinsic life force that emanated from shiny gold and funneled into my body through currency and food, but now that is all gone and I am just a doomed p-zombie!

[A parabolic curve appears as sublinear on a logarithmic scale, whereas as an exponential curve appears as linear.](
The Bitcoin price history seems fairly linear on a logarithmic scale(along with the april rally considered by itself) as is often pointed out.(The comparison to the early and approximately exponential portion of a sigmoid adoption curve is also common) So this all leads me to wonder why several people describe the growth as "parabolic" when it is clearly much faster than parabolic and much more accurately approximated by an exponential curve.

It's only irrelevant if you reject the importance of velocity of money to inflation, and believe in a very literal version of the quantity theory of money. As far as I know there is plenty of evidence to show that the quantity theory of money is not correct for the most part, so it isn't safe to say that the fraction of a money supply in cold storage has no bearing on inflation.

Good point. 
The typical argument about the deflation problem assumes and deflation is the default state when no money supply is being produced, so if the goal is slight inflation(or no inflation/deflation) if inflation becomes too high, all you have to do(following the original argument) is stop adding to the money supply and inflation will decrease and turn to deflation. Of course this means that the desired state can not be effected quite as fast as if the network could both destroy and create coins.

That is an interesting thought, that buying and holding is actually "beating the market" in the sense that market participants on average are getting lower returns than "buy and hold" participants, due to the fact that so many people are losing returns from trading.
An obvious counter-argument is that (neglecting trading fees), the trading game is zero-sum so that on average traders make the same as "buy and hold" participants. This argument does not work because new participants are constantly entering the market. Day traders can lose or gain to new "buy and hold" participants entering the market. For example a day trader may sell a coin to a new "buy and hold" participant, with the subsequent rise in price being a net gain for the "buy and hold" participants on average compared to the average performance of "traders".  
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:30:15
That's great I've been thinking of trying some myself starting with a relatively small fraction of my holdings. I suspect that there are relatively large market inefficiencies in the virtual currency market because sophisticated institutional traders have not entered the game and thus are not exploiting and eliminating inefficiencies. The virtual currency markets may exhibit inefficiencies which haven't existed in more traditional securities markets since the advent of hedge funds doing various kinds of arbitrage. 
Still it is possible that "traders" on average are performing worse than "buy and hold", but of course there will be some traders who perform better than both on average.

This isn't exactly the example I made in my original post(I have a few different ideas on it) but here goes:
First to show the plausibility of what I am about to say look at [mastercoin]( this distributed protocol built on top of Bitcoin supports a distributed exchange system, and also coins with special properties.
Now, pretend that miners win a special kind of coin every so often. This coin functions like a bond, it is not recognized as a standard coin, but holding this coin in your wallet gives you continuous interest at zero risk when you hold it in your wallet, say it spits out 0.1 coins per year while you hold it.(assume you can never "cash out" and only get the interest) The "interest rate" on this "bond" is 10% a year, also suppose that the network randomly awards bonds with different interest rates. These "bonds" can be traded over the exchange system built into the high-level protocol(now remember that mastercoin has an built-in distributed echange system). Network participants can bid and ask on the wide variety of bonds which are produced. Each type of bond with a different interest rate will have a different equilibrium price on the open market. Higher interest bonds will always be more valuable so imagine the increasing price curve as a function of increasing interest on the x axis. The network has access to this price distribution, because the exchange itself is built on the network. The network uses this price distribution to estimate price/inflation deflation rate.
For example if the equilibrium price of the 2% interest bond is very low, but the price of the 5% is a lot higher, this means that there is a price inflation rate higher than 2%. Participants who would normally buy these 2% bonds at a higher price have realized that with 3% inflation they are actually losing money on those bonds, and they can chose any of various other low-risk or zero-risk investments that have better performance. The network interprets these fluctuations in the bond price vs interest rate curve and determines the rate of price inflation/deflation with respect to implicit investment options that are competing with its own bond market. There can be a large number of bonds issued to probe this information, but the coins created by the bonds can still be small compared to the money supply. The bond sales are a nearly passive probe which causes rational actors buying and selling through the networks exchange to produce rich information about the value of coins in the future via the price curve I described. The network performs any number of well tested multivariate analyses to use this rich price curve information to estimate price inflation/deflation. Once this estimation has been made, the network can input  this information into it's feedback algorithm and adjust the money supply accordingly(by adjusting the global mining difficulty) to achieve the desired price inflation/deflation rate.

@_date: 2013-11-21 17:59:56
This is true. However it is also true with Bitcoin. Rich organizations can buy a lot more mining power. In the scheme I mentioned, rich organizations can buy "virtual mining power" in the form of lowered difficulty from the network at different prices, with the difference being that now the network directly learns something about the price equilibrium for future vs current coins. 
The same information could be gathered by looking at the price equilibrium for physical miners for Bitcoins, because the price someone is willing to pay for a miner heavily depends on how they expect the Bitcoin value to change as they slowly mine back the coins they spent on it. However this information is external to the network and thus can not be used as a reliable indicator to adjust the money supply. So my thinking with purchasing "virtual mining power" from the network is that it is no more problematic in general but provides the network with the information it needs to regulate money supply.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:11:45
My original post relies on the idea that increasing money supply enough will lead to price inflation. A slowly expanding money supply can still leave the coins being deflationary, because for example velocity of money,population, goods, and currency adoption can be expanding faster. Without feedback there is no way of setting a constant rate of expanding the money supply and expecting price inflation/deflation to be stable. I am beginning to think you did not read my original post and just came here to "stick it to the keynesians".

If you are talking about the former, I think you are most likely wrong. If you are talking about the latter, who cares there are tons of derivatives relating to all kinds of assets.

Who sets up the Bitcoin difficulty adjustments, who tweaks the difficulty to keep coin generation on track when the hashing power changes? People are just saying that "the network" automatically does everything in a "decentralized" way. There's your centralized, government control.[comparable statement for someone who doesn't know exactly how Bitcoin works]
You obviously believe it is possible for a decentralized network that adjusts the difficulty in generation of coins(which can not be double-spent) in a way as to regulate the production to a pre-determined schedule. 
Can you explain why what I just described is possible but the following addition is strictly not possible:
In addition the network protocol allows the network to reduce mining difficulty for specific addresses when said addresses send coins to special addresses on the network.
If you have no worthwhile opinion on the possibility, but simply mean to point out that I have not proved that it is possible by actually inventing it, well that was why I wrote:


To avoid post after post saying "but how do you know such a protocol is possible if you haven't invented and implemented it! I call bullshit!"

Here is perhaps a better explanation of a slightly different idea that I think could also accomplish the same thing:
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:48:36
It could be scheduled to allow deflation initially to attract investors, living out a "commodity" stage, then some time later when market saturation is achieved it could regulate to low inflation, no inflation, or smaller deflation, thus transitioning into more of a "currency" stage. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:53:16
In both the "bond purchase" and "individualized reduced difficulty purchase" scenarios the network will decrease and increase the overall difficulty as a means to change money supply and ultimately regulate price inflation/deflation. The bond vs "individualized reduced difficulty purchase" price equilibrium are two different scenarios for how the network might actually determine whether prices are inflationary or deflationary, once the network determines the inflation/deflation rate by whatever means, it increases or decreases mining difficulty to try to feedback on this rate and drive it toward the preferred rate.
I think the basic bond idea more clearly illustrates how the price equilibrium for bonds at various interest rates can reflect the rate of change in value of the coins. Having users purchase individual reductions in difficulty was meant to be a replacement for the bond idea which would result in the same kind of price equilibrium information for the network, but reusing the native difficulty/mining system as a way for the "bond" to pay interest.(the "interest" in this case is actually the additional coin mined as a result of the reduced difficulty.) Basically the "individualized reduced difficulty" version is meant to accomplish the same thing as the bond version, except in theory more of the preexisting protocol is reused so that a brand new bond protocol need not be developed.
Originally I thought it might work to let people pay coins to reduce the difficulty overall, but this will not work because the additional coins generated due to an individual paying for a small reduction in difficulty for everyone will be split between all miners, so there is incentive against ever being the one to pay for reduced difficulty. Basically a public good problem.

You just claimed that Bitcoin is currently inflationary and will be inflationary until the final coin is produced, you also claimed that inflation is synonymous with an increase in money supply. Then when I point out this key piece of ignorance which probably precluded you from having understood much of my original post, all of a sudden you have a much more nuanced view of inflation. 
You also opened your discussion by using foul language and insulting claims, this is presumably because you believe that I believe keynesian theory is correct or that keynesian regulations are ethically desirable. If this is your idea of a good discussion I apologize for the dismissive tone, but you have to understand that from my perspective Poe's law was in play as soon as I read the first sentence of your responses.

The only trust that is required is that bond purchasers are acting in their own self interest. The current Bitcoin network also relies on the concept that miners will act in their own self interest by not using a huge amount of capital just to achieve a 51% attack. It would also require a huge amount of wasted capital for miners to dump capital into bonds at a loss just to manipulate the money supply algorithm. The more manipulators buy bonds at a loss, the more the network compounds their loss by increasing the inflation rate further. They would have to waste a large amount of capital simply to screw things up for everyone else, just like the 51% attack.

Great points, and interesting exploration of some protocol issues. As far as statements about possibility I think if you gave experts a high-level description of Bitcoins properties, with nebulous references to "the network" and "the protocol", it would also be seen as an impossible fantasy.
After Satoshi's whitepaper was release and actualized, I think the same experts would be amazed at their own failure of imagination. Now that the first distributed virtual currency exists, I can't help but imagine that there are a large number of related and undiscovered possibilities for distributed virtual currency. I am no Satoshi, for now I can only intuitively grope in the direction of some more precise protocol description that would achieve the described high-level properties.

Same thing happened to me, I just sent them a grumpy email to the support address and they cleared my account and gave me the coins at the original rate. It took a few days but they worked it out. Since then no issues.
