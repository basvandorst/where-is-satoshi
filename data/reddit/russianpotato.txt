Shouldn't you be able to make millions overnight then? If you can really move it like that...
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:07:53
You are just going reductio ad absurdum all over my shit aren't you?
Lets examine how they work now.  People buy them and horde them in large amounts in the hope that they go up in value (deflationary).  They use their inflationary fiat money to make day to day purchases.  This is the logical thing to do with any inflationary/deflationary currency pair, and no thinking person will do otherwise except in small token payments. 
I'm not even going to respond to your whole not working argument since it doesn't even make sense; even as an attempted example of logical fallacy.

I can send the cash in my BOA account to anyone instantly.  I just sent .32 bitcoins to a website and it took an hour for 2 conformations so I could then use them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:53:26
I thought that might be the case, also they kept switching tenses which made no sense.
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:35:11
People will not put all their money into deflationary cash because it isn't stable. There will always be a window where they have fiat because 
a) There are many things you can't buy with bitcoin
 b) Before they buy some deflationary with their paychecks
c) Because there won't be any deflationary money to buy because people horde instead of spend it. 
Unless you a really deluded and think bitcoins and their ilk are going to replace government issued fiat then the rational thing is to spend your fiat and buy some bitcoins and hold them and never use them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:17:53
Yes, unless you have a better option + you can pay it back based on your income.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:39:51
This is a special place.
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:47:22
Same with regular cash.  Why not use that to buy stuff and store bitcoins away if they are deflationary?  This is what people are doing, no one buys a bitcoin for 400 bucks to go spend it at the mall.  They buy it because they think it might go up in value.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:27:40
right because you have to buy a bank to store your money...
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:09:27
Have you ever heard of a student loan?  Most people take them out, why would he be fucked?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:05:19
yeah what is 744 million between friends anyway!
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:54:13
The whole point of cold storage is that it is closed off, someone would have to move the coins personally. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:41:49
Well since it is designed as a deflationary currency, the logical thing is to never spend it if you don't have to, since it should be worth more tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:39:25
Because this is how a currency is supposed to work!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:43:03
That is techno-babble to explain away the losses are you kidding me?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:39:07
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:13:15
Um... just take out a loan.
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:26:13
Yeah I was looking at hashie, and I was wondering if they could do it profitably, why would they let other people in on it?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:44:25
What a valuable "currency"...
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:44:44
I thought it was spectacular, even on a 14.4 baud modem!
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:18:53
Right so seems like a ripoff to me.
@_date: 2014-04-14 12:53:57
Over 100 million people have BOA accounts, but even if they don't have BOA. I can send money to ANY business in the world, or anyone with a bank account, or a paypal account or a google pay account or a skrill account or an amazon account, or even an email account. 
Also I doubt people that can't use any of these options could understand and use bitcoin which is more complex by an order of magnitude. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:36:33
You can't play with or drive bitcoins.  They have no utility beyond a store of value, and if that value is increasing, you hold onto it, and spend your inflationary gov. money.
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:18:20
I've used it, and it just doesn't make a very good currency with 90% of people hording it and those that don't feeling terrible regret after spending or losing it when it was pennies on the dollar.
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:22:17
No.  You must be pretty dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:15:55
But why wouldn't I just use a credit card to buy stuff online?
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:37:44
unless you buy it at local bitcoin in cash it isn't very anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:16:12
It can often be more convenient, when splitting bills or you've been paid in cash for a job.  Bitcoin has none of those benefits and POS transactions take an hour to process. Also often times they don't use cash, esepcially on purchases they want protection on, and people have been moving AWAY from cash for a long time now and for the very same reasons they won't START using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:26:54
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:59:35
So the whole point of bitcoin was no regulation...Why would I ever use it to buy anything when I can just use my Credit card in a fraction of the time and get a full refund if I get scammed or ripped off?  Why would the average consumer EVER use bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:34:10
Why would the customer adopt it when it is clearly worse for them.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:29:44
Yeah, I know why bitcoin is good for merchants, but it is worse for consumers,that is my point (wtf to checks have to do with anything?) .  They have ZERO reason to adopt it for day to day transactions. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:21:30
See, it is actually good news for Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:57:30
Lol he called the top in gold and silver recently too ahahahahaha.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:37:25
With my Credit card it literally takes maybe 10 seconds to type something in, or 1 second if I have it saved in chrome.  I can already make a virtual Credit card if I don't trust the vendor.  I also am not liable for any fraud and if they don't ship my product I get a full refund from the credit card company.  With bitcoin, once I pay, it is GONE so why would I use it with an unknown untrusted vendor in the first place? It makes ZERO sense to use bitcoin in day to day transactions.  I say this as an owner of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:01:20
If people really wanted they could just send literal cash, safer than using bitcoin for most folks, or a loaded gift card etc...lightning, is kinda weird in that you're setting up smart contracts for each and every transaction and need to put up more of your money to guarantee a non-fraudulent claim.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:03:31
I used it as a currency. If I hadn't I would be a millionaire. That is a bad currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:37:00
The merchant.
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:07:50
Right but you don't use it as currency, you use it as an investment.
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:09:07
Nope, people wouldn't spend except barely enough to stay alive. After all, you can buy more with the same ammount tomorrow! It just doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:50:29
Every knows that businesses charge as much as the market will let them for a given product, if they are pricing correctly. People tend to overestimate the degree to which pricing is driven by input costs like trucking, employee pay, transactional costs. 
Very few businesses compete solely on price and I don't think possible very small fraction of a percent savings on transaction fees would ever translate into lower prices.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:53:31
What do you use bitcoin for?
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:20:06
Hey that pile of shit produced more wealth than your life ever did. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:06:55
Dollars are for spending. They have to be inflating to work as a currency, or people just hoard them...see -bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:10:34
Oh you mean like a perfect way to buy stuff with no risk even from a shady sites all across the world? Like I can do with any of my credit cards! They even insure my stuff if it turns out to be fake or shitty. It is amazing! Why would I EVER use bitcoin when I could use cash, much easier and also permanent and personal, or credit...for the impersonal and refundable. What is the use case for bitcoin with those two options on the table? Criminal enterprise over distance is basically it. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:22:51
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:45:10
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:13:07
Have you used it yet?
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:03:02
I've mined more bitcoins than you have ever owned.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:18:47
Dig into my posts if you care to. I was mining bitcoins before you had a Reddit account.  
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:53:53
The same place the merchant gets the rest of their money. Even if they save a few pennies they probably aren't going to pass the savings on to you... in point of fact 99.9% of them won't. There are very few stores that give a discount for cash, and they are all very small mom and pop shops. The same would apply to bitcoin if it was actually free and fast to transact with, which it isn't, and which cash is.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:28:27
It is interesting for sure. But the reality is, the current system for buying things works really really well for most people most of the time. Bitcoin sucks as a currency, the only real use case for it is has always been various types crime over the internet, which is why it will always retain some value. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:10:14
Middle class lifestyle issues have nothing to do with inflation. They have everything to do with lack of wage growth due to dozens of factors. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:03:44
Lol you know what works better than all of this shit? My credit card. Works perfectly ever time, I don't pay the transaction fee and if I get ripped off or hacked all my money is replaced. It is amazing! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:40:36
Good use case....oh wait he is talking ABOUT ME!!?! AHHHH!!!! Yeah right bitcoin is for money laundering, gambling, and drugs. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:19:38
Yes but bitcoin was like that, nothing is stoping these other ones from coming up.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:44:07
I'll give that a shot, I'm not great with Linux stuff but I did set up a dual boot system long long ago. Time to pull some HDs out of some family/friends computers.  I have 6 that I still have with me and have searched using regular methods and probably 6 more that I have reformatted and given to people.  Wish me luck.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:26:43
Thanks for the info, don't worry I think I'm savvy enough to avoid obvious scams/tricks/trolls.  I'll see what I can do with the links.  Thanks again
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:56:03
Didn't even think of that, so maybe I shouldn't send them anywhere... Shit...
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:32:11
Yup, I also sold a penny stock at .38 cents after doubling my money, it went on to go to 42 dollars.  This is my life...  I dance around the edges of making some serious money, and then fuck it up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:39:32
I still can't find my 3000 coins :(
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:47:06
Can anyone answer why people won't just jump to the next currency that offers them a better chance to be early adopters? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:17:52
Thank you, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:21:13
Looking for any tips or a good data recovery program, I'll give you a good percentage if I end up finding them based on a method or program you recommend.  This whole situation has made me very angry/sad/upset.  Not that I would have held them this long anyway if I knew where they were, I'm sure I would have sold them at a much lower price.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:06:36
Well If you think losing quite a bit of potential money is a brag then yes.  I don't think I am getting it back, I am just hoping beyond all hope that the wallet is still on one of my reformatted hard drives.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:03:01
I mined around 3000 bitcoins on a Pentium 3 I kept next to my real computer... I trashed the computer a long time ago and have no record of my wallet number.  Trust me, I dug out an old box with 5 or 6 hard drives in it and hooked them all up about 2 months ago looking for that lost wallet.  Wasn't there.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:18:37
I thought about that, the only HD that might work is currently in my GF's computer and I'm certain it has been overwritten too many times by now to recover anything, I guess I could send it out but I don't even know if it is the one.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:17:31
Thanks I'll take a look.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:51:53
I may have...
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:45:29
Just that it will be a battle between using an established currency and jumping ship to the newest one to try to take advantage of a possible large rise in price, like we have seen in bitcoin in the past few years.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:48:55
 I can build a computer out of spare parts and thermal paste but fuck me if I don't know much about linux right?
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:48:31
Well it would be more like if you were worried about Canadian gold coins because someone just opened up a new country with fewer people where you could buy the gold coins cheaper.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:27:31
This was 4 years ago, I fix computers and build them for friends/family/people who bug me to do it.  So I go through probably 10 extra computers a year in terms of fixing and reassembling and whatnot, I build servers and media players for myself out of some of them and then some of the parts get put back into other computers if I need them.  For example if someones HD is bad I would load up Windows 7 on an extra HD I have sitting around and bring it over and put it in their computer.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:05:16
So bitcoins worth money because of goodwill, got it.  Hope that goodwill can overcome the urge to be an "early adopter" and try and make it big.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:16:10
Yes but you don't have the potential to PROFIT from switching to another network like you would if switching to a new currency.  I think people underestimate the draw of that possibility.
