It IS like the Dot com bubble in a lot of ways. 
A lot of people are getting rich, and a lot will go poor. 
The technology will advance.

Exactly- just as Internet stocks are always going to go up because Internet use is growing, and real estate prices always go up because people always need a place to live.

The high fees mean Bitcoin can only be a currency for big ticket items.  So it's really only better for rich people to store their high net worth. 
Other coins are better structured to be a currency for every day transactions.

Yes we desperately need decentralized exchanges now. It will lower our tax burden and more fairly distribute power to more nations than 3.

That's a net negative return. 
Where is the money going to- US Dollars?

And the decentralized exchanges are coming: I read that their traffic doubled this month.

I was remarking that dictators can use both socialism and capitalism to steal from the people. Usually they give  away the countries resources (land and government contracts) to their friends in exchange for money or political support.  Socialism/Communism and capitalism are economic systems. Democracy and dictatorship are political systems. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere are socialist democracies and have much higher standard of living by several measures than more capitalist countries. 
Venezuela is socialist, but more importantly, it is a corrupt dictatorship. The politicians have been printing too much money to pump the economy in the short term, much as the corrupt capitalist government in the US has been doing.  Now Venezuela has serious inflation, as the US eventually will. 
It's a tragedy for the people who experience the corruption as a too-expensive loaf of bread, and they literally begin to starve to death.

There's no diff between any crypto and tether. All cryptos are synthesized from thin air. Also consider the US dollar: it is also printed with nothing physical backing it.  I'm not saying tether is legitimate or illegitimate- it's just the same as our other forms of currency.

People can buy 3 cryptocurrencies with their credit card. (Faster, but also more expensive than a bank transfer. It's worth it to pay for the speed if you can capture more crypto appreciation.)
Also, Coinbase is insured, and safety of capital might be worth paying more for. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:54:06
Interesting. What happens will be determined by, and will put on display who is in control.

To clarify- was he acting as a Bitcoin to dollar exchange for other people, or did he actually have a toy business where he happen to be doing business in Bitcoin?

I kind of don't understand this- would it be ok for him to transact with his personal bank account?

So WeChat caught on in China- Visa and MasterCard didn't.  Visa is used everywhere here. 
The Chinese government would rather transactions occur in Yuan than cryptocurrencies they don't control and it sounds like transactions are already fast and cheap in Yuan. 
The main benefit of limited supply cryptos would be an appreciating currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:41
Yes, negative correlation happening. When people sell Bitcoin, they will need other coins to put their money into. This happened this summer too- a lot of secondary coins rose quickly after Bitcoin sold off. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:34:32
Because they're paying to educate themselves. Coinbase is convenient and convenience is expensive.  Gas at 7-11 always costs more.

Don't worry, Bitcoin will always rise forever!

Bitcoin is a good store of value for wealthy people. The relatively high fees are still low relative to their portfolios. Let other coins compete to be currencies and value stores for Joe Plumber.

Amazing and depressing story!  
Thieves come in all forms: the biggest complaint about capitalism is that the entire economy seems to be built on people swindling money from each other. 
Does anybody transact in cryptos with low fees?

And this is a different question than why it takes so dang long to confirm a simple transaction.

Yes, but a redirected website could do the same trick. Harder to pull off, but has happened many times before.

I like your point. 
Then I realized, the banks can’t buy all the cryptos. 
If Cryptos don’t exist, we will need to invent it.

Absofrickenlutely.  Without net neutrality there is no decentralization, and no Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:05:01
Yes, and with the high bandwidth requirement, it centralizes control of Bitcoin into the few hands of Att, Comcast, etc.   They can throttle that traffic if they want, or tax it. goodbye decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:34:05
Bitcoin is mainly a speculative investment right now. "Store of value" generally refers to an asset that doesn't wiggle around much. Bitcoin doesn't need to be a currency to thrive- most of the other cryptos are trying to be currencies anyway. 
For example, why should the US dollar try to be anything but a medium of exchange?  It's good at what it does already. Why should Berkshire Hathaway try to make its stock into a worldwide currency?  It shouldn't- it's good at what it does right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:56:40
Wait I thot we were all commies in here and the purpose of Bitcoin was to kill the banks and their inflation. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:03:08
With the erosion of net neutrality, this begs the question: who's going to pay for all that bandwidth?

Doesn't matter what the old guys do. The young ones will do whatever they do. Like listen to The Who and make that band or The Clash or Frank Sinatra extraordinarily successful. Inherent merit is kind of beside the point.

No. These are features of many cryptos.  The only competitive advantages Bitcoin has are a culture that values limited supply, and branding as first mover.  Technologies are easily replicable, but brain real estate is valuable. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:28:39
It shows even the people in the Chinese government are trying to understand cryptocurrency. They know not what they do. They are afraid. Bitcoin is starting to seem like a real threat to their current comfort. 
Same for Jamie Dimon. He wouldn't talk about it if cryptocurrencies weren't real and powerful.  He is expressing his own fears. He's trying to control what he is afraid of. And he has good reason to be afraid.

The banks are one of the most powerful lobbies on our representatives. And the banks write the banking laws- our "lawmakers" are only there to rubber stamp them. 
...And the same will be true of cryptocurrencies. People made wealthy  from cryptos will soon start to bribe politicians. Then cryptos will begin to own our representatives and write the laws directly, in their favor. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:55:45
Yes, many will. And many will use BITCOIN to control others.

The sad thing is that there is some truth under the OP's wacky sounding story. Dollars are mostly controlled by just a few insiders.  The Fed prints 5%-10% more dollars every year, decreasing the value of our holdings. And now most crypto currencies are centrally controlled. "They" are printing 5% more Bitcoin this year, and 12% more Ethereum and Ripple. Ripple insiders are quadrupling the rate of their selling this year. The sad truth is, the insiders already took control, pushed the price up, now they're selling off high to the masses.

These wallets and exchanges need phone support. It's ridiculous. At some point they will figure out that big money will not do business with them until they have Phone support.

Seems like Coinbase is making normal transfers difficult, and trying to get people to transfer with their credit cards so they can gouge them with fees. I'm starting to look for a new wallet too.

That's not a chart of Bitcoin- they made that up to make Bitcoin appear predictable.
