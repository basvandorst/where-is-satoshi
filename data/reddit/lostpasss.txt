Unfortunately not. I did write it down on a piece of paper, but after 3 years it's no longer in the spot. It turns out my partner "cleaned out" that spot ages ago, and the paper is in landfill.
The password, which is approximately 3 non-short dictionary words, no spaces, with l33t speak, is also written down on that piece of paper. There is nowhere else.
It looks like this search space is roughly 1e+12. Maybe possible with GPU acceleration.

It wasn't 500k when I first got it.

Cheers, I'll hold off the Tesla until 1 bitcoin = 1 tesla.

Yes, only the first letter is uppercase or lowercase. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:48:54
I know the password is 3 english words, medium-long length, no spaces, with l33t speak.
e.g. "dangerouslyC0ldWallet"
I made a completely unique password that I've never used before for this wallet, so it's not anything I've tried.

Isn't it better to store your bitcoins securely in e.g. a hardware wallet?

Just wanted to share an update. Two days of thorough house searching, as well as John the Ripper and btcrecover cracking on rented dedicated servers have proved unfruitful, but I had a sudden thought to look through my camera roll.
Very fortunately for me, I HAD taken a picture of the piece of paper with my electrum seed and password. It worked! The password was "thisismywallet", heh. It's been an exhausting and mentally taxing past 2 days, but I am glad to get access to this fortune. My wife (who threw out the paper) is stopped beating herself up over it and is very relieved too. 
I have a pretty great job and fairly stable finances, so I don't have any urgent needs. I'm trying to figure out what to do with this completely unexpected windfall (I had completely forgotten about this wallet, and thought I sold all my bitcoins). 
I am planning to sell about 10 BTC to buy a Tesla (including covering CGT), sell a bitcoin for a nice vacation, and keep the remaining 65 bitcoin. Maybe chuck $100k into the stock market to diversify a little bit.
What are you thoughts? **(please no begging, will not send anyone money no matter what your story is. you will get banned from this subreddit)**.

I know what the first word of the passphrase phrase is, with ~90% probability. 10% probability that it isn't the first word, but rather the second or third.
I know it is 3 English words, (C/c)amelCase, and involves 1 or 2 "l33t speak" substitutions. 
I think there's about 25 bits of entropy here which seems crackable by a GPU. I might give that a go. Not convinced that "extract-electrum-halfseed.py" is secure yet.

1. The real owner of bitcoin is who he controls the keys.
2. Don't believe it until you see six confirmations. (i.e. to your wallet)

I don't have the seed. My wife threw it away. Password was also on the same piece of paper.

Thank you. I was aware that people could reverse the addresses, but I figure they're public on the blockchain anyway; and it's an Electrum wallet so everything is clustered and change addresses are easy to spot.
I will be burning this Reddit account.

Thankfully we have no high interest debt. Student loans already paid off. We don't own a house, but the down payment for one is definitely now very possible. Maybe after the Tesla?
I have already ordered a Ledger and Cryptosteel and this is how the remaining coins will be protected. I think the hardest decision is, how much should I sell? How much should I keep? And what non-cryptocurrency assets to invest in?
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:28:13
I will wait until 1 bitcoin is 1 Tesla :)

Thanks for your help. I am trying JTR right now and btcrecover, their token system seems very flexible.

PNGs don't have layers, and just to be safe that private key is empty :)

The market has ALWAYS disagreed before a stock market crash. A correction happens first, those puts become a little bit more expensive, and they become crazily expensive once the crash is actually on its way.
Go look at the puts history for 2008 or even 2000; you'll see the market is always terrible at predicting doom, and has huge optimism bias.

Why is real estate as an investment a waste?
