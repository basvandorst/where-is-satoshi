I have been using Ledger since Last year and like it a lot.  So much so that I got one for my new baby niece and we’re gonna contribute to it for her fyoutcha!!!

Cool. Right in Montclair.  But what is the benefit of using these machines as opposed to coinbase or another exchange?
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:22:09
Thanks for all the info.  I still use coinbase (i know, the fees!!) but then just use exodus for mainly OMG, then to my ledger. I have a bittrex account but haven’t used it.  Been accumulating since late september...

I have only used APMEX once and JM like 10 or so times.  Both are great.  I prefer JM, don’t know why.   But one thing I can say is that everything was alsways flawless.
