am I wrong?

Ok but if people are not willing to pay a high price per transaction, and the price at which they are willing to pay to transact is significantly lower compared to the electricity cost of the miner to include that transaction, then what happens? My understanding is that one day mining rewards will be so negligible that the only reason to mine will be to make a profit from the transaction fees themselves. But if the fees that people are willing to pay are significantly less than the costs required to mine, then miners will be running at a loss, not a profit. What happens here?

if you put $100 in now, in ten years time, what would be the price of bitcoin to get the same amount of return?

when all of the bitcoins are mined, how will there be incentive for miners to continue processing transactions? The transaction fees will have to be high enough to justify the electricity cost right? If this is the case, then how will Bitcoin survive if the fees become so much that it puts people off transacting? Thanks

"Bitcoin has never fallen below its previous all-time-high."
Explain pls. Previous ATH is 19k, we are at 7k, it has fallen below its previous ATH, so you are wrong

Still doesn't make sense. BTC reached several ATH's all the way to 18k and we have fallen below that price. It's a stupid point that isn't even true, unless I'm missing something

10000 bitcoins is the best
