I've read that the minirig uses 2300-2500 watts and that is too much for a single circuit in houses and most offices. I was just wondering if the OP had to get an electrician in and what, if any, work was needed.

Thanks for the info, is the 2-3% credit card processing fee on the merchant side or the customer side? I am in the UK and we just pay the price advertised, is it different in the US, rest of world?
I only pay interest if I don't pay off my card each month.

It's fun to tip, it's fun to get tipped. It's fun to buy shit, **avoid credit card fees**, and get paid with bitcoin.
Doesn't Bitcoin have transaction fees paid by the transmitter?  Where, I think credit card fees are on the merchant side of the equation.
