Do you even go to McDonalds? Many of them have accepted NFC payments since google wallet came out, and now it's in every store as they partnered with Apple. 
Also, you're fucking delusional for even thinking McDonslds might EVER accept Bitcoin.

Wait wait wait. Did you just say that the person who bet that it WILL be worth millions is more likely to win?
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:25:35
THIS JUST IN: BLIZZARD ACCEPTS BITCOIN!!!

What? Where did you get the idea that buying with Bitcoin gives you a 20% discount? Because that is not true.

I have never heard of a bank that doesn't have fee free account to account sending built into the online banking system. 
And if it doesn't, there are tons of services like PayPal, Square Cash, and Venmo, which all provide free sending and receiving. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:08:01
You know what else lets you do that? A USD bank account with a debit card. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:07:04
It's not like you can buy/use on most Bitcoin Wallets if you're under 18 either. The parent has to approve, which is the way it should be. 
PayPal also doesn't verify your age as long as you have a bank account connected. 
Square Cash transfers money from one account to another instantly. Literally in seconds. For free. 
Bitcoin is literally the definition of jumping through hoops. You have to convert your real money to Bitcoin, which takes hours, if not days. Then when you buy something you have to wait minutes, or hours depending on how many people are trying to do the same thing as you. You don't have to explain to your kids when Bitcoins value halves overnight. 
I just can't grasp why you would want to teach your kids about a wannabe currency that's only useful for CP and drugs that will be dead by the time they're 18.

Wouldn't it be even easier to hand the cashier a debit/credit card, have them swipe it, and be eating your Taco Bell within seconds?
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:30:11
Yes, then they get new debit cards issued and are out $0.00. 
As opposed to Bitcoin, where they lose everything. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:46:38
As said, there is no discount or bonus for paying postpaid bills with Bitcoin. (I'm not even sure if you can).
Second, I did read the article, and giving a 20% bonus is **not** the same as giving 20% off. You are still paying the same amount, just getting a little bit more.
If a pizza shop posted a ton of signs in their doors saying all pizzas were 20% off, but when you walked in they told you that you had to buy a large pizza at full price and they would give you 20% of another large pizza, would you not feel like you were lied to?
It's not like you can pay $4.17 exactly and get $5 of credit. There are specific options you *have* to pick from, so we'd both be paying $5, $10, $25, etc. You'd just be getting a little more.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:34:57
Or you could pay your bill the normal way!
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:03:26
Yes to all of those questions. 
Plus, he could buy things on pretty much every website ever if this bank account had a debit card. 
He could also buy things in stores. 
He could receive cash from pretty much anyone, and deposit it into his account. 
He would be protected against fraud and theft. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:22:49


The problem is that is isn't. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:19:49
Yeah, calling up your bank and having wait days (at the most) to get your money back (which was never really gone in the first place) must have been so hard!
Bitcoin is so much better! You can't buy anything, and when your money is stolen, it's gone forever!!!
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:35:02
Not as easy as it is to select a saved credit card on an account, or fill it in with auto fill on any modern browser. 
Getting your money back from a fraudulent purchase is also pretty easy with a credit card. What about Bitcoin?
I also have my credit card number memorized. Can you say the same for your Bitcoin address?
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:22:31
It's certainly more complicated than using a credit card. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:54:57
What exactly does Bitcoin add. 
also, please let me know when Bitcoin implement basic consumer protections like chargebacks. It's not even a little hard, so why haven't they done it already? When will I be able to call up my Bitcoin bank and get my money back from a fraudulent purchase?
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:06:00
Let's see. It's not only slower than a credit card to use, but takes about 200 times longer to confirm. 
It only supports three transactions per second, and increasing it to whatever it's gonna be will still be a pathetically low number, and will cause all sorts of other problems. 
Secure? LOL. I don't have to buy a $120 device (that they say themselves is only worth $20) to keep my money safe. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:46:16
It doesn't take five weeks. Especially in the case of someone stealing your card number (as opposed to a chargeback.) 
And if you use a credit card, your money is never really gone in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:12:22
Are you saying that the person who had $400 STOLEN from them shouldn't get it back?
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:09:15
That is so stupid. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:44:26
ANYBODY can get a bank account and a debit card. And if someone lives in some third world country that doesn't have banks, I bet that not being able to buy things online is the least of their problems. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:05:53
No, should have and did. 
If it was a tangible item, the police would have taken it away. Because it's stolen goods. 
I love how claims he did nothing wrong, but he doesn't realize that the theft victim didn't either. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:15:24
My credit card is saved. 
And I have the number memorized. I could type it on a number pad much faster than I could take my phone out of my pocket. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:52:37
What the fuck? 
I could say the same thing but reversed. A CC transaction would be a hell of a lot easier than a Bitcoin one if you had zero Bitcoins. Like 99% of the world. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:44:00
Are you seriously considering Bitcoin a valid option? LOL
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:04:36
You are not getting 20% off. Period. You are getting 20% extra credit, credit that may or may not be wanted/used. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:44:25
Im not saying that it isn't easy. I'm just saying that paying with a credit card is much easier. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:21:36
I can't believe you just went negative for saying using a credit card online was safe. 
Certainly safer than anything Bitcoin related will ever be. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:25:54
Create an account to what? You don't have to create an account to most websites you buy from. And if the site requires you make an account, they'd require you to make one for Bitcoin too (but let's be honest, they wouldn't accept Bitcoin at all)
If you're talking about making an account to PayPal, etc., that's akin to making a Coinbase or other wallet account. 
Remembering the password isn't an issue because I have Autofill on all my devices. Nor is it a security risk. I don't just leave them sitting around unlocked, but in the unlikely event someone manages to gain access to my computer or phone and buy something, a ten minute call to my bank will have it all sorted out. (But it hasn't happened yet). 
Somebody steals your Bitcoin, and it's gone forever. Send the wrong amount of money to someone? Good luck getting a refund. 
The truth is that Bitcoin literally provides zero benefits to the average consumer and tons of downsides, and that's why it will *never* take off. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:25:39
They do. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:13:36
Yeah, we are definitely not on the same page. 
Setting up an account is a one time process. On Amazon, I can literally buy things with one click. I don't have to open my "wallet". I don't have to copy and paste. 
On any site that supports PayPal, all I have to do is click "pay with PayPal", click log in (my password is saved), and click to pay. Still easier than Bitcoin and copy and pasting. 
On any site I don't want to make an account for AND doesn't support PayPal, all I have to do is click the Autofill button, glance to make sure everything is in the right spot, and click buy. 
And with each option I'm protected from fraud. I just don't see what Bitcoin offers that appeals to the common person.
