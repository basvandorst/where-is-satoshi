You're sorry for my loss? I didn't lose my btc, electrum file is just corrupted and I need a little assistance fixing the problem.

I tried uninstalling electrum put it isnt even listed under programs. 
Do I need to run command prompt to delete everything? If so, how?

How do I rename the walletfile? Through command prompt? 
I tried running electrum through command prompt but I get the same error as clicking on the desktop icon. 
Ill try it again.

How do I correct this. Can you walk me through using layman's terms or direct me to the best help. I have been at this for 2 1/2 hours now, still no progress. I tried reinstalling electrum windows installer but same error keeps popping up.

Cool, because I was approaching panic mode. 
It will not even open after reinstalling. 
I downloaded it originally through the windows installer, tried to reinstall same way but it still wont open. Then I tried to reinstall through standalone executable. A different error pops up.

HAHAHAHAHA FINALLY!!! I love you bro, I swear i thought i would never get pass this. 
Why did renaming the file fix the problem? 
You mine answering a couple more questions?

I'm sorry but I am fairly new to this type of knowledge regarding removing files and programming languages. How do I move the file. Do you mean remove the file? 
What is a "-w switch"? 
I understand how to restore from seed. 
If the file is corrupted does that mean someone tried to hack into files or I just fucked up downloading electrum?
