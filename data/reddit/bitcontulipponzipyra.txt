Thank you finally another smart person! Basic stock market knowledge. Price cannot go down FIFTY PERCENT and then recover. It just does not happen. Prices rise rise and rise when they start to go down you know the ponzi scheme has reached its logical conclusion and bitcoin is over. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:30:06
No. We have different opinions on a lot of things. 
Utuxia = says it like it is
Btcpyramid = more subtle 
Tulip futures = the hero of the group 
Nobody believes you = the understanding one
Me = one of the newest and still learning
.... 
You get the idea, there are different types of opinions and personality. Clearly different people. Very creepy that are so paranoid. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:31:33
100 percent certain that this will happen. Companies that invested in bitcoin already lost billions of dollars
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:37:06
There is no moon everyone has already tried bitcoin there is no more growth it was a fad and people are moving on to the next better thing 
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:57:39
I am also in top five percent of holders holders! Thinking that I should sell it all ASAP!  NOBODY can deal with this problems! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:39:32
Yes Bitcoin is a unsecure ponzi scheme I am glad some people in this site understand this finally! Going down to LESS THAN HALF ppl lost everything nothing can come back from that
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:23:44
LOL "one to two people" .... You have no idea...  How about you just give up now, we are just getting started 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:15:14
Do you understand incentive? No one does something for no reason. Except us, to help people and increase their knowledge. 
Maybe we would would stop if we were given more incentive. Not a threat but I'm sure the community can be generous to improve its image? I don't accept BUTTCOIN though 
This reddit is dying as is bitcoin. As you can see every day we are convincing more reddit accounts that bitcoin is a scam and they should join us to spread. Tj
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:28:39
How is this person a troll who wants to help everyone succeed for no benefit to him look his other posts he spends warning people against unsecured ponzi scheme scheme for NO benefit to himself. More like HERO
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:51:23
I was just clicking to see what happened, and I wanted to delete the bitcoin but it accepted by accident 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:41:43
Correct it is a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin = gold = stock = massive ponzi. Bitcoin is just the newest ponzi. Why don't people understand intrinsic value. 
As usual Utuxia you are spot on. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:09:38
No its already proven to be a scam! 
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:16:45
People don't understand. They think that we are at the beginning of user adoption. So wrong. The world has seen bitcoin already and they tried it and they they have moved on to better things. The price cannot recover from dropping to 50 percent! It's over go home! 
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:03:43
Yep! wants to buy bitcoin when two months ago people couldn't give them away! Down to $100 and on gox even less! 
Price cannot ever come back from dropping so far! 
What do you have to say about that? Are you sad??? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:06:04
It is the end of bitcoin, prices will be zero within one month, now governments have banned it will not survive underground. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:21:08
Yes governments do not just fall! Or maybe it happened in the past but it won't happen today! But maths breakthroughs breakthroughs are happening all all the time rendering crypto useless! Just look up quantum computers they have already been made
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:13:41
Yep. Luckily reddit rules mean this is a free country and we can actually voice our opinions! In other words, no one is gonna ban us and we have a lot of time and incentive, so how about you bitcoin lovers all just go home and leave it to us. 
Bitcoin is an unsecure ponzi scheme! Have fun on the moon! 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:09:12
Yes you must trust your government! Australian government does not need you to be critical they take an oath never to do anything mean
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:34:36
Yep they downvote when you are making them feel sad
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:46:59
Actually I have been on the net since '92. Your move. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:28:00
Yes this is very true! Smart writing! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:18:27
Why are people down vote this truth post
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:33:27
Rrrr! You always beat me to first comment! 
I think tulip sums it up well! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:34:27
Yes! 1% attack imminent! They have registered their mining group with name "unknown" so no one will suspect! 
@_date: 2014-03-22 09:50:30
Of course you are selling everyone is because the ponzi bubble has popped
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:47:04
BUTTCOIN. But maybe now dogecoin. I have inside information that I think he defected, have to check that to make sure though. If so, Lol, even mc hammer doesn't want to stay. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 06:35:29
Exactly! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 06:57:32
Very mature this person was just providing feedback 
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:46:33
You have no idea what you are talking about 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:05:14
How is it a circle jerk if we are just working together to help  avoid this ponzi scheme with no intrinsic value. More like cooperation which is a good thing last time I checked 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:21:31
Up vote because as usual nobody believe you speaks the truth! Soz wrong one
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:16:43
Good one tulip!
No reputable company would have picture of CEO licking hammers
