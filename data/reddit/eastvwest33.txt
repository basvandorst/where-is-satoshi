First of all... Never pay upfront. Until they send you shipping evidence. DO NOT PAY!
This goes for many online services such as alibaba, or any starting companies.
If you have no choice, use PayPal, or a credit card. One call that something is not right and they block the money. Problem solved.
The story sounds horrible and I wish you all the best!
I cannot believe it's running on XP... Wtf?

Funny thing is Bitcoin is supposed to be modern, so you would expect the software would be too! There is 0 reason why it should be on XP... Other than the makers being lazy scumbags and trying to cut corners before people noticed.

How much would such a position pay? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:34:13
Haha that's useless... The price needs to be like gold.... Thad it... Then everyone would drop the euros and the dollars!
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:08:11
Yea but a gradual rise is fine... But not 10% per day...
That really needs to be a thing of the past before the masses come...
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:12:09
It was going so well.. Stabilizing.. No crazy up and downs...
And then this happens...
If we are to ever get bitcoin working as a real currency it needs to stop moving so much! Haha
Idea why this happened..?

U need to pay a higher network fee... then it gets process in minutes ;)

Bots are a big reason... sometimes they mess up good and bad and over buy/sell...
There are many bots and they all affect each other!
One day the price will crash... just for a minute or even second.. to 100 or even less! (Fingers crossed!)
It's good and bad... but in the end we hope for gradual stability :)))
Go bitcoin!!! HODDDDLLLLLL
