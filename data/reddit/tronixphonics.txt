I believe this is part of the reason why it's not vastly used yet.  I've looked into Bisq before, but most of my desktop time is at work which I can't download/install anything.  If they came out with a mobile app, I see a lot more adoption.

I kept my coins on exchanges for over a year but finally pulled the trigger on a hardware wallet.  Aside from the obvious benefits, it also has helped me from emotional selling since I can't quickly access it when I'm at work or out somewhere.  A lot of regret from doing that in the past but it's a learning process.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:02:01

This was my first thought.  Call me old school, but I will never understand why people need something to do everything by the sound of their voice.  Maybe a control thing?  Maybe just like hearing the sound of their voice?  Whatever it is, companies profit by providing "simple" and "fast" solutions to naive people and gathering info is simpler and faster than ever.

Yea, I don't see how the wait time is them "scamming" you.  Unless you were like me and tried to jump on the bcash wave when they offered it and had to wait a week while you were watching the price plummet and there was nothing you could do about it lmao.  Good times.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:34:37
Why would you need the seed if you ARE able to use the PC wallet and SEE the funds?  Just send them to a new wallet, no?

I thought China is trying to stop exchanges from allowing its citizens to buy/sell from them (at least that's what I remember reading the other day).  My first impression was they don't want their country's money going in and out of it, but want outside countries' to invest.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:13:30
Make sure you out out take the seed so you doesn't eat eat it
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:05:24
It wouldn't be where it is if everyone that bought some just hodled, no? (not the only reason but still)

Imagine if/when the masses, including the rich, decide to stop using fiat, sell their stocks, and put most of their money in bitcoin.  The government wouldn't know what to do as they would see a major decrease in need for their fiat.  Would they start shredding all the billions they've printed lately?  Or would they try even harder to ban bitcoin?
And agreed, something/someone that's imitated, has already won.  Bitcoin is the new cool kid in town that everyone wants to hang out with or be.
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:19:56
I have to agree, people that don't know will always bring up the price and see it as a failure based on now.  There's no changing their minds.  When they're finally ready (on their own) and get that ahha! moment, that's when they'll want to learn more.
Don't take away their moment by making them more skeptical by why you're pushing bitcoin so hard.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:54:33

I wonder if all the bankers, politicians, drug/weapon/human traffickers, white collars, murderers, rapists, burglars, thieves etc. would equate to at least 5% to 10% of the population.  Add that to the speculators and some time and maybe we'd get to 20%.
@_date: 2019-12-06 11:59:44
Except that looks like it's on the verge of being a bitcoin cash logo, just a little more to the left.  Wonder how they'd feel about that one lol.
@_date: 2019-12-11 12:10:32
Some places give 50% off if paying in crypto during promotions.  It's amazing.  Also makes you think, they must really believe crypto will go somewhere, which is reassuring.

@_date: 2019-12-16 11:58:55
People also had to work a lot more hours to get that $20 compared to now.  You wouldn't expect to get a full shopping cart back in 1928 for an hour of work would you?
Also, you can show what 1 house was worth in 1928 and what it's worth now.  Bitcoin isn't the only thing the image can relate to.  I still like it tho lol

Like hey, let's change the name of something that has been around for 10 years to something new to confuse people and turn this whole thing into a shitcoin, I mean shit.

Okay, yes that's good, but there are hundreds of articles a week that give bitcoin exposure, mostly the typical "Bitcoin crashing, how low will it go" then 10 minutes later after a spike "Bitcoin to reach new ATH."
Sure, exposure in any light is great, but for the masses that don't know too much about it, how do you think they feel when all they see is "this" type of reporting?

I have this weird thing happen a lot since I was little, that things coincide with my interests.  TV shows would be on and if I stopped watching for a season, they were canceled, when I was into skateboarding back in the day, a few skate shows would pop up, things like that lol.  When I heard about bitcoin and other crypto, I sure was telling people around me and some invested and I dove head first right around Sep/Oct 2017 and then bam!  ATH.

@_date: 2019-12-02 12:39:21
Might just be my paranoia, but I would wipe it a few times just in case.  Good thing you didn't have anything on there yet so you can basically have a brand new card however many times you'd like.
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:29:34
Nope, never heard of it /s
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:21:17
But the lines also cross near the bottom in the center twice.  So why didn't anything happen there?
And it would be nice to see this from the beginning of BTC, not just 2 recent bull runs.
And finally, if this is at all accurate, would you risk everything based on it?

Same here.  Summer of 2017 is when I first really heard about it, a guy I knew was talking about buying it but he always seemed shady.  Months later he doubled his money and kept buying and I finally pulled the trigger and since then have been free-falling down the ever so vast rabbit hole.  As for people who don't know much about it, I've had some call it a pyramid scheme, a scam, etc. yet they wouldn't even take the time to look into it or hear about it.  Fear of the unknown I guess, natives to settlers, blacks to whites, etc.

Why do people spend so much real money on video game items?  Granted, they can actually use items in the games as opposed to these coins but still, I think that's silly too.

That's why he/she should invest only what they can afford to lose.  In that sense, $1200 isn't important :D

If you're going to stretch it this much then the electricity supplied to the miners or the land they are on also belongs to the government (bills, property tax, etc).

Unless when you die you go to a world where bitcoin is already the standard currency.  Maybe that's where the "lost" bitcoin went and go.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:41:09
He mentioned the hot wallet as your spending wallet, cold wallet is for storage until you decide to move it to the hot wallet to spend.  Why do people get so upset?

Girl starts undoing the belt...that's right, bitcoin's my bitch :P
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:38:58
Haha!  I was going to say something like that.  Drove with red sunglasses on once, never again.  Maybe only the outside view is red, inside clear.  If not, idk what to say lol.
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:47:53
Ha! Now that you mentioned it.  Good catch

What is that?  Definitely not bitcoin

Haven't we learned from the past few days of "another perspective" chart posts here?
@_date: 2019-12-09 12:38:46
I'm sorry, but in my book if there's a typo or grammar is off (we are fast-growing crypto project) then it's a scam.  Also lowercase crypto and uppercase Crypto.  The only consistency is the bs lol.

Same goes for drug dealers, beggars, girlfriends, etc. everyone really except yourself.  Although, there are times where I'd rather not be my friend lol
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:55:06
I see what you did, you should be an editor :D
Sucks that a lot of people that don't know too much about bitcoin are the ones reading articles like these and let tabloids create an opinion for them.  When they wake up, it'll be too late for them.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:56:08
With that idea, why not think bigger instead of just focusing on moving the price?  Take over the damn world, overthrow leaders, etc.

Question about  under Can't Control...what do you mean by outcome of trade?  If I buy BTC for x, I get y BTC.  If I sell y BTC, I get x.
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:23:45
Don't all coins follow bitcoin?

Lambos are F1 cars and billionaires can buy UFOs
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:06:54
Like a good neighbor, bitcoin is there
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:09:03
Pretty sure the whole "lambo" thing started because Lamborghini was one of the first, if not the first, to accept bitcoin as payment for a vehicle.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

One bent the other one over and forked him, promising a great return.   
 But the fork didn't matter, it was just a hit and run scheme.

Whenever I mentioned/mention the word crypto, the person usually says "oh you mean like Bitcoin?"  But that's as much as they know about the subject lol.
