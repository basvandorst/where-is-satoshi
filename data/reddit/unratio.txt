I like to think Satoshi slipped up this one time and gave away one little bit of revealing info about himself, but you're probably right he was still in character.

Shortly after in the same email Satoshi says:


there'll be some interest
in brute force scanning bitcoin addresses to find one with the
first few characters customized to your name, kind of like getting
