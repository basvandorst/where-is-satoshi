You should also count how much money, electricity, air pollution, oil and other stuff will be spend on computers producing.

You don't need to read this stupid asshole from PIA to understand that BTC has rights to exist.
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:46:27
The best comparison I've ever met! 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:59:28
This simple card gives us a real meaning of what people think know about  BTC
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:11:03
Bad ass MC? Don't make me laugh.
But it's good that he decided to work with Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:57:12
Nice thoughts. Can't wait for your another reddit topic about this conference
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:53:58
Someone should open his own Whore island where only bitcoins accepted. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:13:38
Do they have one? 
Bitcoin CEO? Is it a thing?
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:16:14
Wow. I used to think that economy of scale doesn't work with bitcoins../
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:09:14

Welcome to the truly international world with no borders. Made by americans. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:05:40
Scams! Scams are everywhere!
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:07:18
Who cares? They are not so educated to calculate profits from BTC
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:53:10
Wish i could use Bitcoins to buy games on Steam!
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:05:20
I don't think so. Is it a profession if you need no education to work? 
E.g. Being a trader on the stock market isn't a profession 
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:17:07
Language becomes popular or not just because there is a lot of them or just because they are good. They become popular because of government's policiy. 
America and Great Britain were succeed at the world arena so English is very famous. 
Nowadays, after Chine began to be a huge and powerfull, i think Chineese can be a world-language (instead of it's difficulty)
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:56:12
Yeah that would be great. Maybe someone should write a letter and ask Valve to "enable" bitcoin wallet on steam? 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:06:20
You can find some other bitcoin brothels in Europe (in UK e.g.)
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:19:02
I'm not shaming anyone for using ghash. It's ok. Everybody have a freedom to choose. 
But i'm also think that 51% attack is a trap for better speculation.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:13:12
Because they don't know how to use bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:52:54
+1. Imo he understand nothing about how bitcoin work and what liquidity does it have. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:59:42
Just like hookers in Amsterdam
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:16:29
No it's not. He is a still addicted, but to much more powerful drug - bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:59:43
Yeah, you are right. But who cares?
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:37:15
Need to start another topic called "800". Maybe it will provoke more curious  comments
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:00:01
Ooh, i see what you did there (c)
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:55:04
According to the laws of the genre, it should lead humanity to a cosmic catastrophe
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:48:24
You should check dictionaries and watch the meaning of the word "irony"
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:53:53
Now guys from Holland can watch how they team winning the Football cup and use ATM to get some bitcoins at the same time! Amazing isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:00:35
You can open your own business to print this type of BTC card all over the world. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:17:47
Sounds interesting. I'm in
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:38:26
Another topic for stupid guys who believe in Bitcoin's magick.
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:06:30
Or rob you.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:07:09
Trust me, they can. Just look at young rich guys like Zuckerberg or Swartz and realize what can they do. Amazing, isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:08:49
Yes they are. Imo all bitcoins auctions shoud be public
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:20:15
Are you sure that it should be placed in the bitcoin subreddit? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:47:08
I'm not sure that word "scarcity" is suitable.
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:25:50
You should also convince google play to accept bitcoins coz i'll never buy somebody's album without using it. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:56:19
Hmm, your thesis looks right. I need to take another thoughts about it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:37:30
+1. 
Peopel are believe that bitcoin will change their whole goddamn life. BTC can't change human nature and it also can't change opinion of billion of people who do not use it. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:59:05
Folks love to say that "Oh, bitcoin will conquer the world!" after every silly article about some orgainization in which you can pay btc... 
But you know what? This is the only example about bitcoin's "power"! 
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:03:53
I'm not sure that it's huge enough
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:09:56
I did no useless things. Tough day, ah?
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:09:52
It will be the first rain on the Moon!
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:21:10
No. Buildings was built freaking decades ago. Producing of tables, chairs or any stuff like paper or pens is a normal business and it will be despite of how many banks you can find. 
But you can't say the same about computers. They have tend to change. For now, a lot of people prefer to buy smartphones, ipads, consoles, but not a computers, which is so needed to mine our favourite btc
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:15:12
BTC threads is bag place for trolling, dude. Stop it please
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:06:59


Phrasing! lol
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:50:00
For what? Wasting time instead of doing something really usefull? 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:05:23
Wish you good trip. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:14:17
Does bigger income so big like people want to believe?
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:16:40
As you said, after "adopting" bitcoins it will become mainstream. Do you really need another regular mainstream currency? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:01:08
Extremely appropriate word! 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:09:21
You read my mind bro. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:42:06
Wow! Maybe in the future i'll use my western union bitcoin card
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:33:32
Wow you motivate me not to give up
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:38:56
Wow. Nice! 
Hope that not only students in Harvard love to use bitcoins
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:27:19
My advise to you: follow the development process of currency, its actions towards users, releases as it is the indicator of how good is the team that stands behind the coin. Sometimes it is even more significant than the coin’s community which could be a real fake. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:03:33
After reading it I started to respect these cryptocurrencies which are thinking about moderating old algorithm for achieving memory-bound, ASIC-resistant algorithms. Cause who likes 'funny money'. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:14:38
'script, for example: a good also, but they used wrong parameters', I mean that there are technologies with moderated static parameters, like scrypt-N, scrypt-jane, Momentum and they take a great advantage of original algo.
