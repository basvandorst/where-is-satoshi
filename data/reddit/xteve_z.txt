Well, it's actually a 50 Mile Ultramarathon, all at once, in one day.... I can't believe I didn't catch that ambiguity on the site...thanks for pointing it out!

Thanks, man. I'm going to need it.

The time limit was actually 15 hours.

Thank you for the excellent advice. But, the race is tomorrow. 
Tbh, I'm not going into it "completely" untrained. I'd make sure to workout every chance that I could, but my engineering studies consume my life, so it is very infrequent when I do get to the gym. I just have not been able to dedicate enough time to a strict training regimen. Also, I've biked from Austin, Tx to Destin, Fl. I had minimal prior training too, for the same reasons. I just don't want to look back on my life and have these questions unanswered "What would've happened if I tried this or that". So, this fear of future regret drives me to do these unthinkable challenges. I'm not trying to say I'm unbreakable, or sound cocky about my capabilities. All I'm saying is I really want to run the race, and I don't want to make any other excuses to prevent me from trying. 
However, What advice do you have for socks, underwear, and shirt? Do you have any recommendations to prevent chafing? Also, I'm debating whether I should run with my CamelBak or with water bottles.

Righteous! I'm running the Hell's Hills Ultra in Smithville, Tx. ( You can see "Steven Guillen" towards the bottom on the registered page.
But, it was 8 days of pedaling. I had no idea what the hell I was doing at first, and I kept getting lost. First couple days, I only went about 50~60 miles in the right direction. Also, I injured my knee pretty bad and developed a serious upper-respiratory infection in the middle, so I had to take a day out to rest and take a bus to the next town. But after I got better and figured out what I was doing I was going about 80~120 miles for the last 3 days. The most I ever rode in one day was about 120 miles. Total I pedaled about 640~650 out of ~750 miles because of my sickness and injury in the middle. 
But my advice, is don't stop eating, don't stop drinking water, and don't stop pedaling. I wouldn't have made it without music too. I imagine your terrain is going to have some monstrous hills, so you're definitely going to have to push.

I'm just trying to shed some positive light on Bitcoin, and raise funds for charity to benefit education...and find some good music to get me through the race, dude.

I did it. It wasn't pretty, but I did it--I finished the goddamn race. See  "Steven Guillen" under the 50 Miler column:

thank you, PrincessChoadzilla. I like your name.
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:33:25
Thanks, man. I need the positive energy.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:02:44
Really, I would've trained but I was consumed with my engineering studies. I would infrequently workout, and run, but I just never had time to fully dedicate to a strict regimen. And, the race is tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:15:56
Wow...Thanks for letting me know! You're

Thank you, sincerely, Atheose. And, I know it's it going to suck. I know it's going to hurt. And I know it won't be easy. But, that's why I want to do it. I really appreciate your support.

You inspire me

Well, the longest I've ran is about 15 miles. But, Last year I biked from Austin, TX to Destin, FL for Spring Break (I pedaled about 650 miles in 8 days) . Due to school I was unable to find much time to train for that, too. So I'm familiar with some aspects of ultra endurance, and am excited to experience what it's like on foot!

Could you give me some names? I'm not too big into Drum and Bass.
