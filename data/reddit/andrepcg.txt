I wanted to keep my available funds. I already have USD that I want to withdraw without having to buy and sell again. But thanks!

you can read the topic "For n00bs" section
@_date: 2011-06-24 17:05:15
For n00bs:
PLayer 1 sends 1 BTC. (he only gets paid @ 2 BTC)
PLayer 2 sends 1 BTC, so the pot now is 2 and PLayer 1 receives his 2.
The player 2 only gets paid when someone enters after him and when the pot reaches 1*2 (=2)

i have some usd in my mtgox account. how can i withdraw to my bank account (euro zone) without paying huge fees (like AurumXChange or Paxum)?
@_date: 2011-07-11 18:47:39
we need this for iphone!!
@_date: 2011-09-03 22:36:28
I know integrating Paxum and AurumXChange was great but people like me are still missing SEPA withdraws because it's the easiest and cheapest way to have USD from MtGox to euro bank accounts.
Hope it becomes available really soon

What was the value the binary bet was around? 
I bet they lost a large amount of money betting on bitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:06:43

OVH is the hosting provider. Slush's pool was also hacked the same way and they were hosted at OVH
