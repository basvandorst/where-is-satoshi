Are you so mad that you're going to now troll my other posts? Learn to argue dispassionately.


Congratuations, seriously. Early adopters of successful ventures "should" end up with a good return. That's how investment works. Hopefully BTC's rise now isn't just speculative.


I don't know how you got that from our other conversation, or if you think it's a successful trolling. Bitcoin is a wonderful tool.

Medical student here. If it's up to me, my future practice will accept cryptocurrencies, any relatively stable fiat, and goods and services bartered as long as they're directly useful to me. 
There is a lot the feds can do to screw that up. Lots of market forces which can also screw it up e.g. 50% of payer base is medicare.

Bitcoin is speculative right now. While it's hard to predict any sort of economy, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it crashed, just like after ~$35 last year.

I will forever kick myself for not investing when my friends and I were talking about it (~$1, maybe less). My good friend's brother invested at 10c. The return is staggering.

What would my lack of liquid cash in 2010 (2011? I forget) have anything do with my opinion that BTC, should it become successful (which I certainly hope for), will face issues with IRS attempts at taxation?
