I honestly think EnjinCoin has huge potential as a catalyst. 
One large scale game/developer rolling out a game with it integrated could trigger a lot of things given the diverse uses of the standard they built for it.

Part of it is a matter of investment and institutional risk. 
If a little guy is going to build a system that requires X hours and $YYY per month in electricity and other misc maintenance costs they are going to have a harder time running the system and waiting out a potential return to profitability with a market recovery at a point where the system is making no or little money.
With someone with more well funded, either personally, through a small pool of investors, or something larger scale, they have the financial backing to wait it out, and potentially pick up good lightly used equipment on the cheap from little guys who are getting out because they can't afford to float an expensive electricity bill for a few months until the market recovers and they can convert to fiat at better rates. 
Think of it this way, the little guy who needs to sell his BTC for fiat to break even on costs because they can't float it is losing out on the gains from a potential market recovery. When the market recovers, if it does, and we are back at 10 or 15k prices in many months, the little guy is going to be at 0 btc because they have been selling to maintain, and the bigger guy is going to have held on and have a huge bump in liquidity that they can use to further expand their system. 
Personally, my system is small enough and I am in a good enough place that I can leave it running and accumulate BTC even if the market goes to complete shit for a few months. My goal is to accumulate BTC through the setup, I will deal with converting to fiat at a later point. But I would have some hard decisions to make if my financial security changed. I actually track the day of value of what I produce as well as the current value. If current value is less than the sum of day of values, then there is no way I am converting to fiat to cover costs, I am going to float it (unless I have reason to believe the market is never going to recover).

You are the reason we can't have nice things.

I think I prefer the approach. 
It feels like a more effective progression and integration of gaming and crypto/blockchain. 
Simply paying players to play is a bit offputting to me.

I am realizing my comment probably makes it seem like I am mining BTC directly, sorry! I have a GPU mining set up that uses Blazepool and Ahashpool to mine alts which auto convert to BTC and is paid out to a wallet when I hit the thresholds. 
So I don't think I can answer your question as asked. 
Edit: this is my formula though, based on mining and holding only, no converting to fiat/trading. 
="Current Price" +("Current Price" *(("Day Mined Fiat Value" - "Current Mined Value")/"Current Mined Value"))

That is a fair point, and it has significant implications on the difference between small, mid, and large operations and the capital they have on hand and how they use/manage that capital. 
Personally, I have my tracking spreadsheet set up in a way that shows what the "hold" value of my mined coins is, or essentially, if instead of spending money on hardware and mining, if I had instead purchased BTC directly for fiat on the same days I acquired it through mining. 
Currently, my position on this is functionally $8,813.52. So I would have been better off converting to fiat each day, rather than holding the BTC. 
But I am not strapped for cash, and I don't have a strong belief the market is going to tank forever, so I will just hold until we are up over 8.8 and try to follow it up by adjusting stop losses, and I will be better off than if I had converted to fiat every day. I'll "pay" myself back out of profits at that point for the electricity costs I am floating currently. 
I do it this way because I know I am a shit trader, so I am not going to fiat convert with the intent of then later buying a dip.

I trust myself building and managing a mining system more than I do with any kind of trading. 
For example, I trust myself to take mining profits, and reinvest in a mining setup, and increase my production capability over time more than I trust my ability to buy, sell at a profit, and then re-buy on a dip effectively. 
Plus, it's a fun project.

It is heavily BTC price dependent. 
If the price goes up the ROI is cut down tremendously as coins already mined go up in value.

I typically have 3-6 reddit accounts created and "active" at a time, but one main one. This way I can burn one every few months and drop into a new one that doesn't get called out as a shill/bot for being new and having zero activity when I argue something. 
I am sure if someone really wanted to they could connect a few of the dots, but I couldn't even recall a list of all of my reddit accounts over the years if my life depended on it.

This makes things so much more clear. Thank you.

Lol. 
Flat doesn't mean the downtrend is broken until it breaks up above certain thresholds. If we drop to 5.5 it's still a continuation of the same downtrend. 
Need to get above 10 to start calling it a reversal and even then prob best to hold off until over 11.5ish.

Interesting. I think I may have been misunderstanding something fundamental. 
I thought part of the issue with things like airdrops and PoS mining was that people's addresses for exchanges are actually pseudo wallet addresses generated by the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:57:38
I assumed that exchanges were officespacing those and that after a certain amount of account inactivity time they claim the dust for the exchange and consolidate it?
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:01:45
Lol, get out with that bullshit.

Taxes are not going to ever be higher than profits in the situation you and the person you are replying to are discussing. 
The idiot move would be cashing out and not planning to pay a tax on the gains when that is the expected obligation at the time.
