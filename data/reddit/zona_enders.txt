Imo a big green candle after no trading volume is what screams pump and dump

It would be better if investment banks couldn't do that, I agree, but there was plenty of economic exploitation even before those banks were doing the kind of thing that led to the crash and bailout. And my earlier point was how do you imagine investment and lending happen at all without inflationary mechanisms like partial reserve requirements?

Why would a sheep need to trade if it has everything it needs and wants?

I guess this is the same point as in my other comment, but do you have any idea what the macroeconomic effects of people not being able to get loans for business would be? Houses, aside from being crucial assets for most people, are primarily a way for weaker economic agents to establish useful credit in order to be able to invest. Yes banks get rich off this and predatory lending is a thing, but just doing away with this one kind of thing and leaving the rest of the economic world as we understand it will most immediately hurt all the people who don't already have a lot of capital.

If broad acceptance causes a sudden bull run then at the very least, based on historical trends, merchants have no reasonable choice but to accept btc at fraction of the (then) current market exchange rate to hedge against massive dips, and how many btc holders are going to go for that? How does this get stabilized enough to work in anything like the near future?

Same. I'm done with the fomo though, if buying at the perfect moment means staring at candle charts all day and getting stressed about gaining or losing 5% of my cash every ten minutes then honestly it's not worth it.

Sounds like capitalism friend, the sheep don't have the same ability to take the wool to market (even if they would benefit from doing so) so the farmer,  who does have that ability, gets to take whatever he can get away with off the top.

There is much less reason to believe that your house might completely lose its value, plus you need a house to live in regardless of its market value.

Do you believe that the state uses this sort of asset seizure in a systematic way as a form of revenue? And do you believe that capitalists, in general, are opposed to existing monetary policy (ie the use of controlled inflation to promote liquidity)?

Would the driver pocket the btc and pay the fare themself? Would they do so at market rate at a moment when the price is dropping? Would their bosses be cool with it? (fuck the boss, but pragmatically it matters) 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:53:12
Yup, exactly. I was doing really well trading before this week, had increased my btc by like 25% just trading, and then bled all that away in the last few days betting on pump and dumps. Lesson learned.

To be fair what else does a sheep want and what else is it going to do with its wool?

Banks pay interest because it's in the interest of the wealthy for them to do so. If/when the ruling class stops even pretending to extend the same benefits to the rest of us btc isn't gonna make a dent in what that will mean for us.

Saying "things will be better because they will be different" without explaining either how they will be different or how that difference will be an improvement is not an explanation, it's a profession of faith 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:06:46
I'm not arguing either, I think crypto might be useful for some good things.I'm just arguing that the utopian vision people are selling about how this will alleviate economic exploitation doesn't add up. If it happens the way people like you imagine it will then the most immediate effects will be unemployment and poverty for most of us, which means far greater exposure to exploitation whether we have crypto in our wallets or not.

All in the same minute 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:09:03
So do you believe that in a world where cryptocurrencies are the standard that lending institutions will have a 100% reserve requirement?

What's meant by promise of future value is that the issuing govt promises to maintain money's legal status as tender, generally by continuing to circulate it and demand taxes be paid in it. You may not have much faith in the US dollar, but most people on the planet seem fairly convinced by the promise of future value of the dollar, hence why you can easily buy goods in dollars almost anywhere.

Then how will people get loans for houses or to start businesses? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:45:23
Ah okay, cool. If very many people started paying in btc would you still be able to offer the discount? I'm not trying to be contentious, I just see lots of people talk about how merchants should do this sort of thing but very very few of them are in a position to do so themselves (nor am I a business owner) and I wonder how the business model actually works out, esp re volatile exchange rate

@_date: 2018-03-19 16:25:08
I'm not saying banks aren't exploitative, but the class of people who own the banks or are wealthy and powerful in other industries also have a lot of money in banks and want interest on that money. My point is if we reach a point where they actually start saying 'only rich people earn interest now' the political implications of that are much bigger than anything an alternative currency can address.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:12:59
I will be the last person to sell you on benefits trickling down. I agree that the current way of doing things is exploitative I just don't think the idea that an alternative currency addresses why that is is a very informed or considered one. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:32:59
I think the reason you don't want to get into it is that you don't have an explanation, and if that's true I think you should reexamine your commitment to this. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:28:13
I'm entirely unconvinced that inflation is the reason things are currently exploitative, whether within the empire or between the empire and the world it exploits.

I've thought about it, but really I think I just need a break from it for a little bit. I've got my last 12 weeks of undergrad ahead of me and they're gonna be hard enough without part of my brain constantly worrying about price margins. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:02:41
I mean, that's really just another platitude but anyway, /just/ imagining things without interrogating whether they are actually solutions is at best wishful thinking, often it's a kind of religious devotion. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:50:46
I'm not saying people should sell rn, I have no idea, but comparing btc to something with immediate and foreseeable material value like a house is absurd. Day traders and hodlers are both just speculating.

That's easy to say, but when it has recently seen such dramatic dips its objectively a terrible business plan to accept payment that might be worth significantly less by the end of the month. In the long run if it stabilizes then sure, but it seems like a chicken and egg problem that isn't going to be resolved any time soon.

That your response to the person above is a confused one. You seem to think the person above is getting fleeced by their desire for convenience in money use, but the way you think they're getting fleeced seems to be something that using different currency can't address. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:04:37
My thoughts exactly 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:51:07
If banks could only lend on actual reserves (especially in a world in which people had moved their money from banks to crypto in significant numbers) then new investment would shrivel because loans would be much more rare and prohibitively expensive, which would directly cause serious macroeconomic shrinkage (as it does every time there is reduced lending and investment, though that's never happened in modern history to quite the degree you're implying), ie massive unemployment.  
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:57:17
Okay but is 'no bank fees' really what you mean by changing the world of finance? How would that have any effect on finance? Are you gonna get better loans because of btc? Are financial banks not gonna be able to securitize anything and everything just because btc exists (or even if it became the dominant currency)?
