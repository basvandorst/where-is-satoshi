You seem like an asshole, so I'm just going to downvote you for being pompous.

That's great and all, but what if not enough people decide to donate? I guess the poor should just starve?

That's the problem, though. Depending on individuals to voluntarily donate enough money to keep disadvantaged people fed and housed means that there is no guaranteed lifeline for the needy -- they're at the whim of private organizations to provide necessary goods and services.
When things get tough economically, people (understandably) stop donating as much or as frequently. As such, the institutions they are donating to are not able to keep up and resources available to the people who need them most dwindle. At least in the United States, the era before a publicly funded social safety net had drastically fewer options for the average person to get back on their feet after losing their job, being hospitalized, etc. [Private institutions, while a valuable part of the charitable giving ecosystem,
 have not and cannot provide all essential services for impoverished people.](

Damn, I wish I knew about this before! I was in Cape Town less than two months ago.

Politics is complicated. He tried repeatedly to close Guantanamo, but was [blocked at every turn by Republicans and opted not to force it closed with an executive action](
As to what he did well: off the top of my head, he got 20 million more Americans insured and eliminated the disastrous 'pre-existing condition' exclusion from healthcare coverage. The ACA overall was a disastrously implemented compromise (due in large part to opposition from the Right at every stage), but still provided some enormous benefits.

We'll see what happens when President Tiny Hands and his cronies have their way for the next couple years. Should be interesting, at least. I've got my popcorn ready.

Given that decades of research have shown that minority candidates of equal or greater qualifications than their counterparts get hired less frequently and for lower pay, I can't see what you're basing your opinions on except anecdotal experience.

The pretty clear answer to "why" is that people don't always act in a purely logical manner. Often times, people are not even fully conscious of the biases they hold and thus regularly pass over minorities with equal qualifications to majority candidates without realizing that race/gender/orientation play a factor in their decision making process. Since many individuals within these demographics are statistically less likely to get the higher paying jobs they qualify for, they have no way to demonstrate their economic potential to a prospective employer. It's nigh-impossible to quantify the lost 'potential' gains from picking one employee over another when their qualifications and abilities are roughly the same. Additionally, it's less about "intentionally pass[ing] up economic advantages" as it is about having minorities with **equivalent** qualifications be less likely to get hired in general.
It's nice that race/gender/orientation is considered trivial to you in relation to other factors, but I can guarantee you it certainly is **not** trivial to a huge number of people. I urge you to look into how 'implicit bias' affects employment. Here's an article I found interesting:

I can't give it away because the President-elect is already selling it to the Russians piecemeal.

I'm glad your college freshman level humanities classes taught you such quality "high level argumentation", but they clearly skipped over the bits about logical fallacies and ad hominem attacks
