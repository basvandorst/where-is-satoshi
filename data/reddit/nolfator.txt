Isn't kraken fixed now?

It's the same as bitconnect. There was no proof it's a scam.

People who write these articles are clueless and overly dramatic to make titles a clickbait. 
Exchanges in Europe already require passport /driving license/ id verification if you want to move bigger amounts. 
Banks already report to government when large sum is being deposited to your bank account. 
This is not even mentioned in the article....

I don't think LN is even remotely private. That defeats whole purpose of tor.
On chain tx are more private imho when it comes to bitcoin.
Of course other coins offer better privacy.

Because tether refuses to provide proof of audit result showing they actually have the money they claim.
What proof do you want from regular people? We do not work for bitfinex. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:54:27
Wait, people said it is not possible to ban bitcoin. /s

State officials said the only legal currency in Russia is ruble, and in the future cryptoruble.

So a company/business will go through intermediary, who must be capable to handle multiple salaries for multiple employees, possibly from multiple business clients. 
Now, I can not imagine regular person can be this intermediary, except big financial institutions. How is this decentralized peer-to-peer? Because it does not look like one at all.

Watch this update from bitcoin dev that was recorded 2 days ago.
It is far from working product. Give it until the end of 2018.

There are 1360 cryptos listed on coinmarketcap.

Yes, but Bob has to put upfront enough BTC to cover all the possible transactions. Do you think Bob has hundreds of BTC laying around to manage such big channel?
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:20:00
Ok, so if you want to trade and arbitrage, you do it how? Via decentralized exchanges? There are too few and very little trading volume.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:34:35
Don't you set a total amount of BTC on one channel before it is open? And when it is closed, the sum of BtC between the 2 parties can't be higher then at the time the channel was opened?
If I open channel with gas station, I put at start 0.05 BTC, they put 0. Continually I buy up all the gas and reach 0 BTC on my balance. If I want to buy more gas, don't I have to close the channel, and open it again with new balance?

When you trade on exchange, you don't touch blockchain. Coinmarketcap counts exchange trade volumes, blockchain not. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:09:40
I am asking, based on this post from couple of days ago 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:34
Yes.

That's pretty interesting idea, to be paid via LN channel.
Is it then possible to never actually leave LN? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:44:11
Yes, but you must put enough BTC on your node to cover all the transactions that are supposed to occur. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:51:11
So, to make LN work the best, it would be great there will exist couple of huge nodes, that have open channels with thousands of shops. 
I as a single person, will open one channel with this huge node, and I can enjoy all their connections without opening thousands of my own channels with all shops.
This huge node with thousands of channels, will have to provide upfront big sum of BTC to cover everything.
Now, who do you think has the capital to purchase hundreds of BTC to be able to manage a huge node? ...
How is this LN making bitcoin **decentralized** and **peer-to-peer**? Because I see only couple of big nodes (**centralized**) rerouting payments through multiple channels (**not peer to peer**).

People who don't believe in the tech and ideology, who just want quick cash, are the first to sell. How many of those were main investors for last month or two? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:51:35
What is the point of having it, if you can't spend it on anything?
Plus, most exchanges require your ID.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:44:01
Transactions on exchanges do not touch blockchain. It happens internally on exchange database.
When I sell and buy on the same exchange, I do not clog blockchain.

How much bitcoin I have to lock in order to be hub for many payment channels?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:28:44


Are you sure? Majority of new cryptos have no intention to replace fiat, have nothing in common with bitcoin regards being generally accepted currency for every day life. 
ETH, WTC, PWR, XRP, ARK and many more do not care about bitcoin as they are not competitors with it. 
Once more exchanges introduce more trading pairs, so people are not forced to buy btc, it will be even more visible. 
If bitcoin fails, it doesn't stop ark, iconomi, ethereum being platforms for dapps. 
These are just examples, but you get my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:05:21
Have to add decentralized and peer to peer. Otherwise it's same as PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:44:18
Isn't bitcoin moved between wallets only when channel is closed? And that happens on chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:36:35
There was a huge talk about size increase. It was declined, that's why forks happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:52:45
FYI, you can't set fees for transactions from exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:27:46
It is like forgotten knowledge Bitcoin was developed to release billions of people from centralized banking systems... It's all about money nowadays.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:22:09
Isn't LN open technology that can be used for any coin? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:50:59
Because it is value/money the government can't control. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:05:10
If you believe what central banker says, they have no power. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:12:18
Once I will have hardware wallet, does it matter if I use Kraken or Coinbase to buy bitcoins? I will just transfer all coins to wallet after purchase.
