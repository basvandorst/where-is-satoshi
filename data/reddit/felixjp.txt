I am sorry. I was not aware that I was on r/bitcoin. I thought I am on r/btc, which I normally use.  
I would never have dared to write such provocative words here, if I had known.

They are middlemen.  
In that position they receive, send, hold money for their customers. For us.  
They take a percentage from the money streams that flow through them.  
They work together with the government for confiscating money from their clients. They call that taxing and have built a whole financial system to perfect that milking process. 
They actually deserve the guillotine, but we don't need to use force. Bitcoin will do.

No tax - and we can build our roads ourselves.

Please have a look at the respective white paper of Craig Wright (some say he is Satoshi).
SegWit and the Illusion of Scale
"In many ways, this is the biggest confidence trick to have ever occurred within bitcoin. It makes Mt Gox seem mild. "
Now Bcore doesn't look so good anymore and should be ashamed.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:42:33
Sorry, corrected!
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:02:11
But maybe you should read the paper, before calling him and Roger names.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:09:36
You seem to be interested in SegWit. 
I just assume so, because this post is from you. 
Please read this paper. It was written just a couple of weeks ago. 
It might change your opinion.  Maybe you will lose your interest. 
Maybe I will lose my money, or maybe you will lose money. 
That doesn't even depend on whether SegWit is a good idea or not.
There are all kinds of market forces at work. 
I just don't like the idea of reducing the P2P quality of bitcoin, to become more depended on middlemen like required by exchanges and side channels. 
I changed my BTC out of principle. They are not bitcoins anymore, just took the name. 
If I lose money so be it. I don't want those ugly altered coins anymore. 
I cannot use them as cash anymore, thats why I like the original: now called Btcoin Cash.

Great, finally you got it!

You are thinking more daily?
Every day?
I am impressed.

Yes, it's called flippening

After reading Andrew O’Hagan work I am 70% positive that CSW was part of Satoshi. It's quite a fascinating read actually if you haven't. Completely objective in the spirit of inquiry and well written.

It really is eye-opening. And such detail!

Cant't he just move his mining equipment to neighboring russia or wherever to continue from there?

Just print out, keep safe, use IC code reader to scan and enter when needed. 
Ledger is just more practical. No need to disconnect from internet, ok even if computer is "compromised" (contains malware). 
Using google app ledger wallets for a selection of Crypto is also nice. Everything in one place.

And if you are wrong? Wouldn't you look very stupid?
Maybe do read that Wikipedia artikel and then tell everybody here about your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:12:32
Why don't you make one and try if you can do that? 
I don't think that "normal" people can decide what to put or not put there . 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:07:50
Who decides what to put or remove from Wikipedia?
Who do you want to be our decider?
