This does seem very frictionless.

Checking it out.

One of our concerns is that our artists will not be interested in receiving Bitcoin royalties. Therefore, we would need to convert bitcoins to cash or take on the royalty payouts ourselves.

What worries us most is how seemingly volatile the value is.

Thank-you for the offer, going to ask our lead developer to play around with the systems in place :)

I don't think we will be able to put time into trading people. This would have to be looked at as an investment. At this point, it still seems like it is a risky investment also.

Are there sites for simple trading? I really can't afford to invest much time into chasing individual trades.

Interesting, I have to agree this alone is pretty exciting. Innovation is required to survive in the current music industry landscape.

Here brings up my next major concern, if Bitcoin has a maximum amount, doesn't that lead to people hoarding their bitcoins? Supply vs Demand etc...
Are there any case studies of businesses successfully accepting bitcoins? Are people actually spending bitcoins?

Hah! As long as the music is getting heard then we are doing our job right.

All E-mails gathered were from people either downloading our music for free in the past or from our artists (Krewella for example).Another possibility, someone may have used your email to download something, we have a rather large e-mail list.
