This isn't the gold market where paper contracts are used to manipulate the price and the actual physical gold is highly controlled.

I believe it is the trading symbol of the fund that tracks Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:37:35
Maybe its their margin or spread; honestly not sure how these fund trackers work.

Crap - I didn't find any reference on youtube. Well, if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and delete so as to not waste everyone's time.

Did you sign up for the newsletter? Did it specifically mention Bitcoin?

Charging interest on student loans is immoral

I'm fine with the price below $500 now. I'm looking for stability in the short term - to allow the ecosystem the catch up/settle/mature. And then to the moon baby!

so? you don't need this info as an investor.
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:24:08
Sorry you think it's ridiculous

It looks like there is a decent level of adoption in Turkey (per quick google search). So I guess we are half way there.
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:12:40
I guess its not there yet. Not a good or bad thing - just what it is.

I have exercised other options - but thanks for your helpful comment. But this is something Bitcoin is supposed to be good at - donating globally.

Its an incomplete picture; because they are on the Euro they were able to borrow a lot of cheap debt from the ECB.

It's a deflationary currency, so house prices will come down relatively . In theory, it will be be better to rent than to own property - as I understand at least.
Africa and South America I think have a better use case for Bitcoin in my opinion - given unstable currencies and economies in those regions.

You would think that the exchanges of today would have identified and reported any significant bot activity, I hope.

Wouldn't the so called capital controls in China prevent (or atleast slow down) arbitrage opportunities between Chinese and non-Chinese exchanges - because (at least at the individual level) it would be difficult to get dollars/euros and exchange to yuan via btc. I guess black market organizations don't care about capital controls.

I'd did a quick search but couldn't answer my own question. Is the MMM scheme using Bitcoin as part of their "social financial network". So people have to buy Bitcoin in order to participate in it?
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:16:12
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:26:37
So not legit volume then?
@_date: 2015-10-29 21:49:46
Maybe a message to the rest of their cabal to say buy bitcoin because our debt based currency is fucked.

Scumbags. Agreed they won't go out without a fight. But the system they created and own is sinking and there ain't nothing they can do about it. Although I'm sure they will try to use crisis to their benefit somehow. They aren't stupid and they see what's coming.

Its all so vague, makes me nervous.
edit: still Hodling though, lol
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:02:59
Sounds like everybody is unsure

Gold might be a historical store of value but terrible as currency. It requires huge investment in trust infrastructure to be a viable currency. Best cAse scenario for gold is that central bank goes back on gold standArd and offers a fixed below market rate for your gold.

Tata is one of the more respected and successful families in India. This should generate some buzz in the Indian business world.

Volume on Huobi is at 842195. Unless I'm misunderstanding, these volume numbers are skyrocketing - it was at 208K just 3 weeks ago. What gives? If the Chinese public were buying (thus causing this massive increase in volume), surely we would have heard something concrete by now and not just rumors.
