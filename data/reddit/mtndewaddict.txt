Capitalism is a pyramid scheme. The working class creates all the wealth that the capitalist class has. Not the like the richest of the rich do anything other than leverage their wealth to get more wealth.

No, it isn't.  It can buy energy at varying prices but it doesn't store energy like raising water and letting it run through a hydroelectric plant or even a simple battery.  To store energy, it has to remain the approximately the same and be usable in some system.

And North Korea is a Democratic People's Republic. I mean, it's right in the name. You'd have to be moronic to think they're anything other than democracy with a name like the DPRK.

70% of the jobs being in the private sector is socialism? Here I thought you'd need at least a majority of the jobs to be controlled by the workers. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:14:17
So am I. The majority of the jobs there are in the private sector. Even Fox News reports that. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:32:49
No, it literally does not. Read Kropotkin or Goldman. Read about the EZLN operating in Chipas. Google Murray Bookchin, a state is literally antithetical to communism.

TIL 70% of the jobs being in the private sector is socialism. Nevermind the workers controlling the work place stuff.

The only contradiction comes from assuming private property naturally exists. Which is what the criticisms you linked say. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:43:49
Yeah you just have to ignore the Ukraine Free Territories, Revolutionary Catalonia, the group I already mentioned the Zapatistas, the autonomous regions of China, pre-split korea as they were chasing out imperialist Japan.  Then you also have to ignore how almost every democratic attempt at socialism had a US backed coup like Pinochet in Chile.

What can I say, [private property is theft]( from the public for private exploitation.

Pick one, communism is by definition stateless.

Trotsky? Don't you mean [Fox News]( and I quote, "What socialism? Private sector still dominates Venezuelan economy despite Chavez crusade." It's closer to a [social democracy]( and it got real fucked over when it's main export had a dramatic price crash.  But I mean, us on the left knew this back in the late 1800s. Kropotkin wrote about it in the [Conquest of Bread](

 Showing that they work, bring in large profits (in the US the ~300 bring in over 400 million annually), increase worker satisfaction and conditions seems like optimal. Unless your the capitalist who was extracting surplus value from your workers.
Yes, the US toppled a government and like usual the people prefer the old one. Especially when they crashed their economy that took two decades to really recover GDP wise.
Quickly read that guys worker page and industrial democracy. I'll read more but workers councils or syndacits are were my ideal organization lies. Worker control over the workplace is what I want, and if he's arguing for that like my quick read says then he's alright. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:13:09
Yes you're calling state capitalism communism for some reason and concluding communism doesn't work. I might as well call the DPRK democratic and conclude democracy is totalitarian rule. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:21:22
By encouraging democracy? It's all about democratic control over the workplace. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:22:08
No like actually read Marx, Kropotkin, Goldman, or any socialist writer. Also those are all self declared socialist states.  If that's all it takes to please you, you'll be happy to know North Korea is a Democratic Peoples Republic.

Pick one. Communism is by definition stateless.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:41:25
That's why you should at least be a socialist. Under capitalism the capitalist class (those whose income is from owning not laboring) extract your surplus value. Those who earn without labor nessecitates others labor without earning.

Huh that was easy to prove your rant wrong. In a cooperative workers are happier, more productive and better paid than their authoritarian counterparts. The only thing that's not better in a cooperative is profits because workers are actually getting their share, improving their working conditions, and doing things right the first time.
Also I'm going to think you'll be shocked when most Russians prefer the [USSR than the Federation](

I'm saying the country isn't socialist because the workers do not own the means of production. That's the cornerstone of most socialist thoughts.  I would say the reason they're economy is so fucked is because they only expropriated some things (oil, housing) and left other things in private hands. Anarchists like me know this would be the outcome since 1892. Kropotkin wrote about it theoretically in the Conquest of Bread,

Im trying this out now. I'll update once I get the code.
EDIT: Just confirmed and my code works this service is amazing glad you have it.

I did, basically what I got was china is buying a lot of them. But that just doesn't sound right.  I feel like there has to be other reasons for the skyrocket.

This was what I was looking for, thanks for pointing that out.
