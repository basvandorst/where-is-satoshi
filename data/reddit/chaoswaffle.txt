Basically a [Double spend]( allows you to send coins to one address on the current main blockchain, quickly mine a block in secret (you have to beat the rest of the network) then send the coins to a different wallet on that block. You then need to make the secondary blockchain you forked longer then the current main blockchain, and then it will become the main blockchain in effect making the first transaction void. Double spends become much harder the more confirmations are required to consider a transaction valid, as you have to wait until the first transaction is valid before you can release your "secret" blockchain to the public network. No number of confirmation can prevent the attack if the attacker has more than 50% of the hash rate.
For a more in depth analysis of the attack, see this [pdf](

See the comment I replied to. Just slapping BITCOIN! on the side of a car doesn't interest tech savvy people. Personally, the tech behind a race series interests me just as much as the actual racing. From this standpoint NASCAR doesn't interest me at all, that and I'm also not a huge fan of oval racing (and yes I know there are a few street courses).

Peercoin is hybrid, but the Proof-of-Stake blocks are mined completely separate from the PoW blocks from what I remember. 
I didn't think about that about proof of stake, makes sense though. I like proof of stake mostly because it adds extra protection against a 51% attack and doesn't require specialized, energy intense hardware to operate.

The only reason Doge exists and is popular is because Bitcoin broke that ground first. I have no problem with doge, and am holding some, but you do have to concede that Bitcoin took 5 years to get where it is because it introduced the entire concept of crypto currencies to the world,  which is no small feat.

Because they have a consistent history of problems. Now is your chance to get out with coins priced below market instead of above. In addition, they have some of the highest fees last time I checked.

People gave them shit for "making fun" of Lorde (specifically Spin magazine, which is why they made an appearance in "Cissy") in the "Gluten Free Ebola" episode this season, so in typical South Park fashion they went overboard with it. They do also seem to genuinely think she is a good artist, but it's mostly because Spin gave them shit.

So few people I talk to seem to understand this. However 10 years is a long time, and if we don't have enough adoption by then bitcoin will probably have failed anyway.

They could short the market, then start double spending, making a massive profit on the drop as people see the network has been compromised and dump their coins. No matter how they could abuse their power to make money, having one entity controlling 51% of the hashing power is not good and benefits very few people if not no one.
 
Also, to add to my previous post, it also doesn't benefit the miners of the pool to be in that situation, as they don't get a bigger payout staying in a pool with a higher hash-rate, just more frequent payouts.

Huobi's volume is very deceptive. It's a 0 fee exchange so trading bots tend to play there and cause massive volume from high frequency trading and various shenanigans you can pull off with 0 fees. It's hard to compare a 0 fee exchange to a normal exchange volume-wise for that reason.

This exactly, and if you have an Apache server running, you have to have literally no security measures in place which make it vulnerable anyway. A simple chroot jail and proper permissions completely prevents this attack vector. I honestly don't know what people are freaking out about. Remote code execution bugs are found all the time, many much more severe than this, and if your server isn't set up with limited permissions then you were going to be compromised anyway.

It's really not, if they had more then 51% and were double spending or blocking transactions it would be bigger news then China, and miners will act in their own self interest as to not devalue the asset they are mining by allowing a 51% attack.

The bug had a documented and fairly simple work around before this whole fiasco began. I see no reason they would make this up, especially since they'd lose customers, and as one of the largest exchanges, tons of money.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:58:46
You won't be earning more though, just more frequently. Your earnings are based purely on the ratio of the network hash rate to your hash rate.
I'm going to use arbitrary numbers for this for ease of calculation, but consider you have a fixed hash rate to point at a pool that has 40% or one that has 10% of the network hash rate. Say you point your miner at the pool with 10%, and they find a block every ~40 minutes. Let's assume you have 1% of the hashing power at the 10% pool, you will receive 1% of the reward. At the 40% pool, they would find blocks 4 times faster (every ~10 minutes), however, your reward will be 0.25% of each block found, as your hashing power relative to the pool is only 0.25%. Using a pay per share mining system, your payout would be the same at either pool.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:52:54
If the network was taken over by an entity that could compromise the network and has given no assurance they will take steps to remedy the situation the price will plummet, which would not be beneficial to the majority of miners on GHash.io or anywhere. Having said that, Ghash.io's share is currently at 38% at the time of writing this, so I'm not worried.

Seems like it would be far less wasteful to get the Japanese version and swap in softer springs if you don't want it to be so stiff, but then I question the reason for even getting a Type-R, it's SUPPOSED to be hardcore.

You still need the same amount of time to make it secure, so 60 Doge blocks is the same amount of security from double spending as 6 Bitcoin blocks. The faster blocks also lead to more blockchain bloat, so anyone downloading the blockchain in the future has to download a massive file (this is already becoming an issue with Bitcoin). Each decision has its advantages and drawbacks.

If you have any backups you can load them into multibit (I think that's the one they support). It's one of the great features of blockchain.info, they don't have control of the physical wallet.

If you have no Linux, or limited Linux experience do NOT run Arch. I personally love Arch, but you need to set everything up yourself. The base install drops you into a terminal with very little installed.
[Ubuntu]( can be installed on a Mac, and it's as user friendly as it gets.

Honestly, I can see very few alternatives at this point. The fix for this problem is not hard, Stamp took care of it very quickly. So either something else has gone very wrong, or they don't have the money, and their stalling and lack of explanation is not confidence inspiring.

It's not random faith, [with some basic optimizations which are already written (just not in the mainline code), Bitcoin can handle ~4000 tps on an i7.](
The only thing limiting it at the moment is an artificially imposed limit to prevent blockchain ballooning from spam when bitcoin was first released. The major hurdle after lifting that is making sure larger blocks will propagate the network fast enough so there will be a minimum of orphan blocks, and storage space for operating full nodes (as they have to store the full blockchain).
@_date: 2014-07-08 20:17:03
It's the rate at which an i7 can calculate RIPEMD-160, SHA256, and ECDSA using SECP-256k1, which is the limiting function in verifying if a transaction is valid. It's something modern hardware can do very fast, and is getting faster every day as optimizations to these algorithms benefit a large number of people outside of the Bitcoin community as well. If modern hardware couldn't handle high speed crypto of this nature then SSL, among other things, would be slow as balls.
You can run your own benchmarks using those algorithms if you want to if you don't believe any of that.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:17:29
That's a pretty good comparison. I love Arch, I just wanted to warn anyone new to Linux as it could easily scare away someone new trying it. When properly set up however, Arch is amazing and super light weight. 
I'd also highly recommend Mint, which you posted about. I personally prefer it over Ubuntu.

Yes, short selling is something they could do in theory and they could go to bitfinex right now and open some pretty large shorts if they knew they were going to take 51% of the network and start double spending. I didn't say they were going to, that's just one way they could benefit.
People join pools because it guarantees a payout, unlike solo mining which is ludicrously difficult at the moment, anything over a few percent of the network hashrate is enough to be much more efficient then solo mining unless you have a massively powerful rig. I earn the same with my mining rig no matter what pool I join +- a few percent depending on luck. I've moved between larger and smaller pools, and the only difference has been frequency of payout.
see my other comment [here]( for some basic maths on the situation

Nope, from Applied Cryptography:
One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that k = 1.38×10^-16 erg/°Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2°Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2°K would consume 4.4×10^-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21×10^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×10^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10^51 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

Blockchain.info will default to whatever is required for a transaction depending on your settings. You can set the default fee calculation to be more generous so your transaction is processed faster or less but the priority will be reduced. You can also send a custom transaction as you said. 
Using the default send and settings I've had transactions sent with no fee or the default fee depending on the age of the coins and the size of the transaction.
You shouldn't have to worry about it if you are using the default settings, I've never had problems.

Proof of stake is a very interesting concept that I would be interested in seeing in bitcoin, but with the current hash rate and money invested in mining equipment it would be tough to make a full switch any time soon. I also don't know how effective a hybrid system would be if shoe horned in. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:15:04
You also have to be running with bad permissions and not in a chroot environment (which is standard good practice).

I doubt they've published this information as they have no real reason to, maybe a report at the end of the quarter will include that information.

The bitcoinity charts are terrible for most analysis. If you want to learn more market related stuff, use tradingview or at least bitcoinwisdom and look up everything on investopedia. Tradingview has a lot of options and analysis tools that are quite useful. Even then Bitcoin does what Bitcoin wants, but I've found it helpful to know a lot of the technical analysis concepts for spotting general trends.
