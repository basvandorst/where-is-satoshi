If you've enough to put 2 billion into 1 wallet you've enough to hire the a team.

I posted nearly 2 weeks ago mate, stop dredging up the past, and not everyone lives in America.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:24:15
That would be a terrible future.

Will the selenium sulphate help the price as well as leaving my hair shiny and flake free?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:02:02
I'd say the same thing to you poster.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:03
Wait for it to all blow over and buy tomorrow.

Bitcoin isn't some magic cure for poverty. There will already be rich and poor, those with and without.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:37:25
So.....they were stolen.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:44:06
The yuan.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:11
Are you also not a fan of police and the fire brigade?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:29:11
Surely it'll just function like another currency. 
Buying something costs the same in euros Vs dollars considering the exchange rate so why would bitcoin be any different?
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:18:56
Also they were likely stolen as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:58
No let's keep with that teenage level thinking that we don't need a government.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:03:14
I meant more that they didn't listen to the experts either and it isn't exactly going to plan. Not accepting someones point of view is fine but downright dismissing it isn't the greatest idea, especially when they work in the financial field as the people here. 
Instead of dismissing their ideas how about explaining how this situation is different.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:05
You seriously think a voluntary police force or fire service would be feasible? People would only pay when they needed them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:45:20
Some degree of planning will always be needed in society 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:43:06
No let's use this as an example of why the status quo of money is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:35:25
Britain did the same thing when it came to brexit, it makes sense to be sceptical of everything but at some point you have to accept maybe these people have a point...maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:59
Sounds like you have issues if you consider that violence kid.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:12
Do you really think people wouldn't do this if they could?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:37
No I'm trying to imply if you don't like taxes you must be happy not having the things they fund.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:41:10
I don't know about America but in most of Europe if you don't pay taxes you still get police, fire and healthcare services. So it's not a threat to me if I don't pay them. The whole point is it's a service provided for everyone.
No it's not the most efficient and people are corrupt but you'll find that in the private sector too.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:54:58
I've only put in a small amount each month so if bitcoin ends up flopping who cares but if it doesn't I hope to buy a fancy house out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:13
You talk about it as if it isn't one to corruption. Which private police would you sign up for? The one that obeys proper procedure or the one that shoots first and asks questions later? Which health service the one that gives you that operation that you might not need or the one which follows the guidelines? 
At some point we need guidelines and rules and they need to be followed. And organisation and responsibility little of which the private section has been historically followed or provided.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:06:03
No it just unleashes peoples autistic potential.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:39:10
Judging by some of the terrible decisions people have made there is a case that some need to be protected from themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:09:16
If it's a sure thing then why isn't every penny in the world invested in it?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:26:20
But if your commiting crime we need that information now. Having a list and a profile isn't good unless you want meta data to be a reason we imprison people rather than real names.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:10:23
I think he means more how would you track ownership of them given that an address isn't linked to a name to ensure all tax was paid.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:31:06
Do you know what else isn't a guarantee? That bitcoin has a future value, so perhaps letting the other people have some GPUs isn't the worst idea.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:49:37
Well your sitting there snorting into your coffee as if it's the way for the future.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:09:00
Let me get my crystal ball out
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:09:17
Thats a good deal.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:18:01
Well you can't really issue an arrest warrant against an random alphanumeric walley address can you?
Consider bitcoin has and is used for crime, drugs and tax evasion it should come with some traceability.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:15:34
Well the em spectrum is likely one of the first things a species will discover and exploit. It doesn't make sense why there aren't leaked broadcasts of aliens dancing the Charleston given the size of the universe.
