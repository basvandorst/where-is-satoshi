How will you pay rent/mortgage/utilities/car payments/gas for your car etc? 
I'm tempted to go all in, but I definitely have bills to pay.

Since I've never used it I can't say for sure, but don't most programs do that if you launch it from a terminal rather than double clicking the icon?

It may seem like it's directed at OP but it's mainly so other people will see how dangerous it is. Especially if they have a decent amount of coin.
I'm definitely guilty of some of these things. That's why I got a Trezor. I don't trust myself enough. I know better, but I don't do anything. Yet I don't want to lose my coin so I got a Trezor.

Just curious, why do changetips get downvoted? Is there something bad about it? 
I recently tried to get into tipping, but I don't want to do it if nobody wants the tip. I'm perfectly happy keeping my coin to myself.

I get that, but didn't mitchr4 say they were going all in? I interpreted that to mean 100% bitcoin which seems pretty hard to do for the reasons I said above.

Isn't that what we've been doing this whole time?

They didn't fully elaborate on their example*. $50k is a big mac, but you've already got your student loan locked in pre-inflation at $50k. So if you wanted to buy a house going forward you'd need like $3 billion, but since you bought your house before hand, you just got a house for the cost of a big mac.
The real problem with that scenario isn't so much that you got a house for the price of a big mac, but that your entire life savings up until that point is only worth the cost of the happy meal.
Which is where Bitcoin comes into this picture, if this scenario where to some how actually play out, Bitcoin would be to the USD as the USD currently is to the Zimbabwean dollar today.

This is my first tip, sorry if it doesn't go well. 1337 bits @_date: 2015-01-28 11:18:19
I would most want to pay my bills in bitcoin.

All that means is 1BTC has the same buying power as $50k. Why would I convert if I don't have to?
In today's market it's a little different, we're still waiting on a few big players accepting bitcoin. Things like power companies, cable and phone would help speed things up quite a bit. Apartment companies need to adopt as well. When that happens, we'll have our $50k+ bitcoin easily.
