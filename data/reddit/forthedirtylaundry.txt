Yeah, my registration took about 3 days. That said, I've paid in, and cashed out successfully and have few concerns about leaving my BTC with them.

And if you could dial up the Canadian a smidge, that'd be great.

Dress as a bitcoin and get photographed being life of the party. Later get photographed passed out, hugging the toilet. 
That way lies internet immortality.

I bought festival tickets with BTC a couple of weeks back. It was a total ball-ache and I'm never doing it again.

It was slow and problematic - less the fault of BTC, and more the fact that the merchant hadn't really implemented it very well.
The biggest failing was that BTC processing was separate from fiat. If I'd paid by card, I'd have been notified almost immediately that my tickets were booked... and I could go gloat on Facebook. Instead, it was 3.5 days before I even received acknowledgement of my funds being sent... and even then it was to tell me that their system had undercharged me because, again, it hadn't been properly integrated.
Tl;dr - If vendors aren't going to *properly* integrate crypto payments, they shouldn't bother.

Ew! Isn't he a bit dusty?

It's not the 'wrong move'. Taking 10% is a sound strategy.
The point here is you take the profits you take because the market, your needs, or your nerve would not see you do anything else. You book a profit, you win. It's the right move for you at that time. If you start regretting the gains you could have made instead or losses averted instead of just learning and moving on, you're fucked.
As in crypto, so in life: We do what we do because it cannot be otherwise. Accept, learn and move on.

Never regret profits made. They were the right choice for you at that time.

If they weren't, you wouldn't have made them.
