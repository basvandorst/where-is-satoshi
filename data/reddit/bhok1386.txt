English is the most valuable language to learn in the world. Lucky for us, it is our mother language. However, for the millions of people who are living in third world countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia, Kenya, Ethiopia and countless of other third world countries. The demand for English is extremely high and it is the key for a better life. However, there is one big problem that all third-world countries face. 
English is expensive and reserved for the upper class. 
But hey, the internet is free, there are an overabundance of resources online! That is true, but what if I live with my family in a one bedroom house and we all share 1 smartphone? My native language is in Khmer, and my only reliable access to the English world is through Reddit from the hours of 11 PM to 2 AM each day. Those days were tough, but I really wanted to help out my family and create a better future for everyone.
It was a long struggle, but I really fought hard and long to learn English online. Imagine surfing Reddit in Chinese and flipping through a BIG FAT UGLY paper dictionary by your side.... I did this for over 5 years as a lurker, finally a loyal redditor, and now I am finally residing in the US.
It felt like a dream came true, after I passed my English exams and now I have obtained enrollment in the US.
My dream now is to give third-world citizens a chance to learn English. A chance to create a better living for themselves. 
In thus, I am on the mission to develop a software application that can rid of the expenses and make high-quality English learning truly free, convenient and accessible to those in third-world countries.
One bitcoin could make a difference and could really help launch my dream project off.
