No it isn't. Stop thinking of Bitcoin as something that will replace fiat. It's just another currency. Get over yourselves you fucking neckbeards.

Sounds like a terrible way to use an encrypted messaging service. Why not just have usernames connected to the public keys like other encryption messenger services do?
How could this get popular? "Hey! Message me!"  "Sure! What's your username?"  "It's K5nY80Fd536AxZq6gY2ClvSpr0kH5pAw8VXd5Ke"   "Did you say "K5nY80Fd536AxZq6gY2ClvSpr0kH5pAw8VXd5Je?" "No, it's K5nY80Fd536AxZq6gY2ClvSpr0kH5pAw8VXd5Ke"  "You know what, just fucking add me on facebook"

Do you always post this with a new account and then delete the thread and the account so you can spam it again later? I've seen you do this numerous times now with this dumb app where you have to use gigantic public keys as a username.

~~If I ask to see my private keys on blockchain.info, it asks for the authentication number, not a pin code.~~
Oops, no, once you're logged in you're in, but you need the 2FA to see the wallet. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:21:44
I thought there was a private key and with that you can generate multiple public keys (addresses). Is it actually just that there is a private key tied to a public key and that public key is used to generate addresses? No idea what UTXO is.
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:26:14
Still have no idea what UTXO is but it sounds like each public key has an address. I just never differentiated between the two before I guess. Or maybe it's just been a while...

I just wish mycelium also offered 2fa and/or text alerts and requirements. Why is this such a hard feature to implement? Isn't it just a gem they need to install?

Unless, of course, iOS has a back door that simply allows them to view a screenshot of your screen at any given moment, then it really doesn't matter how the data is being transferred. 
For instance, I love telegram, but I wouldn't be so dumb as to assume it's impossible for Apple or the NSA to view the conversations I have on it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:25:13
All it would take would be one view screenshot and sent. They also know where you are with any iOS device connected to the internet, and they can set your device to destroy its own memory. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:11:06
o0o right haha. 
Well, just to access the private keys, you still need to use an authenticator, at least on my settings. Wouldn't that make it secure? 
Where does Mycelium keep private keys? Why can't I access them?
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:34:36
Yeah sure that's fair. I'm just stating that, aside from viewable backdoors which was my only example, there might be some other tricky back doors that could potentially play roles in surveillance, but you're right with bitcoin wallets it probably doesn't matter.

@_date: 2015-06-25 19:32:04
I don't look at the wallet though. I need 2FA to look at it. It can't login elsewhere without the 2fa
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:42:07
Right, my question is just about whether or not they admit to it or claim that it's kept private. Assuming everything I do on the internet is heavily monitored and recorded, does Coinbase claim to at least make the attempt of privacy or do they admit that the government has forced them to share this information or whether it's done willingly.

What he said is actually false. The simple answer is that there is nothing to do on MtGox but exchange what you have in a quickly dropping market. The volume traded in the past 24 hours, however, doesn't really mean anything at all as far as the total volume of MtGox, which is still higher than all other markets, because it held this position before limiting and eventually disabling all withdrawals.

I'm not the thread creator so it's not my accident. For some reason, I always thought the coins had to be stored in a computer. So, what's keeping people from cracking the code to get into people's wallets other than a gigantic encryption? Over time, won't encryptions become easier to crack due to progression of technology?

Posts like this are cancer. Nothing useful is said. We all know the value of MtGox and don't need an article to be posted hours after price drops when it's no longer valid. Even if it were posted while Gox was under 100, not that it won't happen again, but what good does it do? Lose more faith in Gox? In Bitcoin? I've seen 3 posts about Gox being under 100 when it actually was under 100, we don't need more when it isn't even there.

We don't know how many Btc were sold more than once from the same account due to the glitch. Statements from mtGox are claiming that it is accounted for, yet many of their Btc were sold once the price started dropping.
Basically, confidence has been lost the MtGox really has a handle on the situation. The majority are assuming that Gox is just stalling so they can sell enough Btc on other markets to cover the losses. If this is the case, what stops them from freezing the market whenever they want, letting the value of their Btc drop, selling their Btc on other markets and buying them cheaper on their market in order to profit whenever they want?
There is a gaping hole between what we're being told and what's actually happening at MtGox and it's causing a lack of confidence in both the Btc market, and much more so specifically with the MtGox market.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:02:21

Define a while? Less than two weeks ago we were under 550. This isn't a stock, it's a currency. If you want to play the market, then play it. Personally, I think it's completely idiotic to be upset over the btc market lately unless you just bought at the most recent peak and don't know what you're doing.

Thank you. I don't think this chum understands that the peak was due to the introduction of Btc into mainstream media hype. Not to say it won't happen again, but you need to have a tiny bit of understanding of the people currently in the market. 
Personally, I'd like to see it keep dropping for a while so I can buy more low.

Nowhere in the article does it actually quote him saying what's in the title. And I haven't seen him actually say that directly about Bitcoin. He simply said it's an "intellectually interesting development" and the sensationalism got out of hand from there.

And so can I. And downvotes to you too.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:23:48
For the most part, people not involved in MtGox only stand to gain from it's failure. The lack of trust will be temporary as it was the fault of the trading company, owners, and software, and not a problem with Btc itself. The falling market means another chance to get in on bitcoin at a lower cost before it shoots back up again.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:47:31
Coinbase support is still sort of in the making.

You clearly didn't, as the title suggests. This also isn't new news, this is old news that has been rehashed way too many times to care.
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:37:16
"We think bitcoin will play a very important role in the future. Exactly how that plays out, and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal, that's something we're actively considering. It's on our radar screen."
They've been rehashing that same quote and reinterpreting it with so many articles it's making me sick. Now someone throws a "Tuesday" in there and everyone just believes it on face value. So stupid.

It was more of a joke, but if you think that's built into the app, you're wrong. If someone is making an app to review customers, I doubt drivers will sift through that app before accepting a customer, because by the time they come back their customer will likely be taken by another driver.

You're getting downvoted but that is exactly what he's saying.

Ok so we got to the point. You could have just started this with "I don't know how much I trust Trezor because the one I bought was faulty"
Or is that not what you're saying? I'm just trying to be clear rather than barbarically angry and nonsensical. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:37:10
But a Billionaire could just buy up a percent of all Bitcoin. This is just a redo of a financial system. If Bitcoin were to become the end-all-be-all, it would end up just like the dollar, with a few amount of people owning the vast majority of the market.
Most of this subreddit is libertarian bullshit of people with debt that just want a redo. And I get it, that would be great, but let's not kid ourselves that this is some kind of magic money immune to corruption or power-struggles.

I don't know, is that common? I'm asking you for details not hypotheticals. What are you going on about? 
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:53:20
I don't think so. I'm pretty sure this is just Kraken trying to get a piece of the pie. I've looked into it and they're basically just offering the money claimed in trade fee discounts.

Why? Is TREZOR unsafe?
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:10:07
Except in a world completely using Bitcoin, vendors won't feel safe accepting a bitcoin purchase. They have to wait a long time for confirmations, whereas cash / CC are both instant. 
If they want to accept Bitcoin off the blockchain by using something like Coinbase, there will be fees.
It's the same shit with a different name on it. People just want something new because the vast majority of people here are libertarian and want to rework the system. They just don't seem to understand that the system will always find its way back into everything.

Ok, just saying because my friend was asking me how to buy Bitcoin. I told him use Circle or Coinbase, both of which require a bank account. How do you tell people to buy bitcoin? And explain to them how to use it, and what to spend it on, etc.

Sounds like he convinced a sucker (you) to tip him.
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:18:05


That's not true. It's true while they're promoting, but it's simply not true. If you think Bitcoin becoming mainstream wouldn't lead to BitPay changing their charging methods to something more equivalent to credit card fees, you're drinking too much koolaid.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:43:42
And yet, when the stockmarket shuts down for a little bit over a glitch, this subreddit celebrates as if that's the reason bitcoin is better. As if Bitcoin is more stables than the US economy. Are you getting where I'm coming from at all?
Look, we can go down this rabbit hole of comparisons, and I'll be downvoted because it goes against the circlejerk, you'll be upvoted for being part of the circlejerk, and we'll both walk away *knowing* we're right. Let's just agree to disagree right here.
@_date: 2012-05-30 04:59:39
Yeah, one day it might be worth 1000 bitcoins. That is, when Bitcoins are worth $0.0001 when another major transfer website gets hacked.

Could you elaborate on this? Are you saying there could be a potential benefit and possibility of messing with it in the future? 
@_date: 2012-08-27 09:17:05
I think so. I think millions preferred to spend their money on Pokemon cards than there will ever be people spending their money on bitcoins. I think saying that bitcoins can be offered for a service is like saying you will do someone a favor for pokemon cards. It's a bartering system with a more official looking sign on it, but it's the same thing. A fad. 
@_date: 2012-08-27 10:35:41
What I'm saying is, eventually enough crossovers could happen to the point of a distrust in the currency all together. I mean, I would certainly not want an entire country relying on a currency that could be wiped out with an EMP, you know?
@_date: 2012-08-27 09:03:42
I look at the value of bitcoin like I look at the value of pokemon cards. The value might go up or down, it will always have, to an extent, some value, but to invest myself in something that might not have much demand, unless I'm getting something else out of it, seems stupid. Other fads come along with value themselves, but my old pokemon cards are now pretty meek in comparison to their past values. With work, I could sell them. I wouldn't make much money though and it probably wouldn't even be worth the work put into it. 
BitCoins are buzzing right now. Sure, not as much as they were buzzing during the hype when wikileaks decided to accept it for donations, but compared to what it will be like eventually, it's still a hot item. I think people think it's fun because you can join mining pools and make a little bit of money out of nothing, but once that ends, interest will surely drop. People can't mine them as easily as they used to be able to and that takes a lot of the *fun* out of this fad. 
Once someone makes a new and similar idea, it will probably gain popularity as well. I just can't look at bitcoin like much more of a currency than I can with pokemon cards. 
@_date: 2012-08-27 11:44:45
I don't claim to know everything there is to know about bitcoin, I just think there is a lot of faith for it here, almost as if people aren't even viewing the possibility of the online currency idea flopping in the long run because of how creative an idea it is. This isn't the forum to have this type of discussion though. No one likes when you question the faith of a currency, I just feel like you kind of get bombarded by people who really want it to work here that they will attack your integrity instead of give you the pros and cons to an argument in order to win.
@_date: 2012-08-27 12:24:58
I don't think Pokemon got grown-out of, I think it just fell out of popularity. One problem with BitCoin is the risk of using websites to trade through. They have been hacked. People need to be knowledgeable and careful with every which way they trade anything with BtC. Most people aren't going to feel safe with a currency like that. Also, you have to find a buyer to get out of it. The currency isn't just trade-able like any other currency is. I can go into a currency bank and trade American Dollars for Canadian Dollars for Pounds for Euros for Yen and Pesos. For BtC you need to find a seller. It's more like a stock than a currency.

What I'm saying is, anything that isn't done in person can be hacked. And it's already been done and crashed the market before. I won't argue this any further as you bitcoin fanatics don't quit, so I'll let you have the last word and enjoy your time with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-08-27 14:37:41
What about if your computer breaks? Or the website you trade on that has your wallet details or bank information gets hacked? It seems like that example leaves out vulnerablilities

Unfortunately, we're only getting your extremely negative side of the story and because you chose to sensationalize it and only are now starting to bring up some potentially valid concerns, no one cares.

This might sound against the grain of what people want to hear, but if you guys are all so adamant about Bitcoin being your  currency, then the taxation on profits made from bitcoin only happening when that bitcoin is converted to USD shouldn't be a problem for you. Keep it as bitcoin and you can legally do a whole bunch of stuff that you can't do with USD. 
@_date: 2011-10-06 16:36:17
That's all good and motivational sounding and what not, but what do you mean "Some us don't want to work to enslave ourselves"? Are you saying that working for Bitcoin is better than working for a dollar? 
All I'm saying is that the Bitcoin market is all over the place. It is hard to understand how to maintain safe keeping, and it is hard to trust when there are so many stories and rumors about the going ons of the currency.
@_date: 2011-09-20 14:15:15
That's true. I just haven't been able to muster up the courage to buy Bitcoin. I think I'm too stupid to fully protect my wallet. I've just heard way too many scams and stories to trust any deals.
@_date: 2011-10-19 19:44:36
I don't understand why there is so much hype in this subreddit about the ever-decreasing value of Bitcoin not being a big deal. Anyone who has bought bitcoin has got to be pissed. I didn't buy it because I thought it was a bit too hard to fully understand and I'm waiting for it to be taken as a serious currency (not just a few websites) to make any kind of switch. 
The day PayPal takes Bitcoin seriously is the day I will. (I can already feel the backlash from making that last sentence)
@_date: 2011-08-23 19:26:28
I got an email invite to it. I worry about getting emails because I figure they all come from that leaked list of passwords that got out a while ago from the trading site. 
@_date: 2011-09-20 15:53:17
That might make me feel a little better. The problem is simply that people now have a source to pay for extreme graphic mining rigs that can also be used to figure out passwords. That is why so many bitcoin websites get hacked. If anything, I feel like bitcoin has sponsored password hacking, which is totally badass and awesome, I just don't fully understand what is safe and what isn't nowadays.
@_date: 2011-08-24 03:20:03
@_date: 2011-09-20 15:55:06
I would like something with some kind of authenticator protection as well as a password kept in an overly secure, well known safe place to keep it. I just feel like so many websites are get hacked though.
@_date: 2011-10-12 16:40:46
I'm still waiting for someone to prove to me why it's safe. Any time a new program comes out, or website, or any bitcoin organization, it is immedietely hacked to shit. I'm done with bitcoin, and I know this is the perfect subreddit to say that and collect downvotes, but it's true.
I'm sure there is a safe way to transfer bitcoins, but more times than not, I hear a story of a scam, glitch, or hack that is quickly destroying everything it's supposed to stand for. It was a great concept, but I just don't think it's really going to work long term.
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:10:55
Ohh I see the problem now. That's rather annoying. I guess one good thing is that you can always say you purchased bitcoin on the ups and say you sold it on the downs of the daily market to always create the illusion of loss, though it's annoying to have to resort to illegal measures to not be taxed. 
@_date: 2011-10-06 16:19:35
This is what I don't get the most. It seems at least once a week I hear a story of a bitcoin website that was hacked or was basically pulling a ponzi scheme. Why are we trusting anyone who accepts bitcoin and trashing economies that already have strong foundation?
Also, Bitcoin is way more volatile than gas prices.

The question is, why would he? It is understandable to sell in bulk for a bit cheaper than the market. There is no reason to completely flood it. It takes a long long time to get 1 BTC nowadays.

Bitcoin isn't anonymous at all! The entire foundation of bitcoin is that every single transaction is recorded and shared with everyone. Anonymity takes just a bit of critical thinking about what they're doing to make it anonymous. Buying bitcoin on coinbase and sending it through a few wallets and then to a darknet market is asking to be arrested.

Sometimes bitcoin doesn't even transfer in 2 minutes. Whatever your method is won't work in 2 minutes simply because of that alone.

Mycelium. Do it in person at a bank or a Starbucks.

It's like the craigslist of Bitcoin, so you can just pay them cash in person. That's why you'd want to meet at a bank or something secure where you can hold a bunch of money and not worry about someone grabbing it and running out.

I downvoted you for posting links to articles you made. If you have something to say you can say it here but you're whoring popularity. Not that it matters, but it's against reddiquette.

I think it's the hidden fees. Also, scammers seem to still be able to use paypal's long processing time to fuck people over easily.
