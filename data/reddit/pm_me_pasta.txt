I was following along until this point.  The average person is not going to become philosophical about the very nature of money just because they've started using bitcoin.  People want to be able to get the shit the want.  That's all.

Think of Mt.Gox as an exchange in which users could register and then send cash for Mt.Gox to exchange into gold.  But Mt.Gox kept the gold in the user's account and stopped delivering it.  You could log in and see your gold on their site, but couldn't do anything with it.  And Mt.Gox stopped sending back money when people sold their gold.  Then Mt.Gox disappeared, taking all the money and all the "gold" (a lot of which may never have existed).
Now, because of one company scamming people out of money and gold, does that ruin gold for everyone else?  No.

Transaction complete.  She gave you an address and you sent the bitcoins to that address.  The transaction was complete at this point.
You never should have given her back the money.

It also says that bitcoins are kept in your digital wallet on your computer or phone, which isn't exactly true.  I realize the blockchain is difficult to explain simply, but telling people the coins are in their computer weakens security, as one would expect, for example, that if a computer is turned off or unplugged from the internet that the bitcoins are safe.

**Brian Armstrong:** "So, there's a lot of companies in this space raising money, it's pretty awesome.  There's probably been about 300 million in VC raised in bitcoin companies right now, which is-"
**Alex Wilhelm:** "Just this year or you mean total?"
**Brian Armstrong:** "Total.  Which is roughly equivalent to where the internet was in maybe like 1997 or something."
**Alex Wilhelm:** "Between Bitpay, Blockchain, and Coinbase that's about 100 million in the last three rounds alone.  So the number of bitcoin servs that are now worth more than 100 million is really proliferating quickly.  I'm really excited to see about who dies first.  That's going to be a really fun day."
**Brian Armstrong:** "That's so negative."
I don't think I've ever seen an interviewer as unprofessional as Alex Wilhelm.  To speculate without basis that the company your interviewee works for is going to fail and further suggest that the failure will be amusing is astoundingly unprincipled.

Just now got it.  For anyone slow like me, it's a pun on the words "coin" and "con," implying that bitcoin is not a coin but a con- a "bitcon" if you will.  
I'm guessing you're correct that he had one or more comedians come up with this clever pun.  It's possible for a mere writer to have a once in a lifetime Oscar Wilde level flash of wit like this, just as it's possible that I win the lottery ten times in a row, but much more likely is that a team of who's who in comedy sat brainstorming for weeks to create this simply brilliant pun.  One for the ages.  I suspect we'll be telling our grandchildren about this Fortune Magazine interview.

So you're defending your theft by saying that if you didn't steal from them, you would have ruined their business by giving them a horrible review online?  Are you sure there wasn't perhaps a middle option that doesn't involve teaching your kids to steal or costing the mom and pop farm "hundreds of dollars worth of business?"
Let your kids scream and cry about not getting pumpkins.  You would have taught them that you're an honorable man and even though no one was watching you didn't steal the pumpkins.  They likely would have remembered this day the rest of their lives.  Instead you taught them to steal.

If Bitcoin was a sort of ecosystem in which individual amounts were programmable as the video says:
1.  Bitcoins could look at which address they're in, at other coins within the address, blockchain history, etc. and generate some sort of output based on their environment.  ex. Someone gives you some bitcoin that you cannot spend unless you've previously donated at least 0.05 BTC to the Red Cross. 
2.  Bitcoins could message one another.  ex. A game is broken into pieces and each piece is spent.  If they all end up in the same address they coordinate to reveal the playable game.  Win the game and you get the private key for a reward (or perhaps the bitcoins initiate the reward transaction themselves), lose and the game pieces become unspendable.
3.  Bitcoins can interact with outside APIs, querying information as programs often do.  ex. You can only spend this bitcoin if Paul Krugman retweets Andreas Antonopoulos. 
Those are just some examples off the top of my head.  And I'm pretty poor at coming up with this sort of stuff.

Downloaded the client sometime in 2009 and left it running for a few days, accumulating hundreds of bitcoins.  Promptly forgot all about them until the exchange rate skyrocketed last year.

You miss an important point.  The database isn't "duplicated for validation."  The way the database is validated is what's novel about the blockchain: it's extremely difficult (proof of work) to add to the blockchain, and each addition depends on the previous addition... meaning that validation comes from the structure of the database AND that this validation continues to function on an untrusted network (the internet).  Until the invention of the blockchain we've never had a database that could exist decentralized on the internet AND remain 100% trustworthy.

I call bullshit.  To get the IP addresses of 60% of Bitcoin users sounds incredibly difficult.  Many users are using thin clients that broadcast their transactions on their clients' behalf, so getting these IP addresses would require access to the provider of the thin client.  Even if I'm running a full node and broadcasting my transactions directly onto the network from my node, the only way you'll know my IP address is if you're a direct neighbor of mine on the network, right?  What are the odds of that with 5,000+ nodes?

To you, there probably isn't currently any advantage to using bitcoin.

My bet is that Karpeles' amazing incompetence caused him to lose the private key(s) to his cold storage.  Then in a futile attempt to recover, the exchange started selling imaginary bitcoins that only existed as a number in the Mt.Gox database.

Okay, based on what I'm reading I think the video is a bit disingenuous when it shows arbitrary programs being attached to an amount of bitcoin.  Using the blockchain like a bank's API to query transactions and create them, etc. is quite a bit different than having autonomous scripts running on top of individual chunks of bitcoin.

You have to realize that to many people, these kind of messages seem like spam.  Hell, I own bitcoin but if someone sent me .0015 BTC and I had to signup to Coinbase or Circle or BitPay or anybody to redeem it, I'd probably ignore the message, too.
People are used to offers of a few cents to signup for some service they don't need, and ignore them.

Well, the video says that "each individual unit is programmable."  And shows code attached to an amount of bitcoin.  If I'm a computer scientist and/or layperson who knows nothing about bitcoin, the video is telling me that the bitcoin network is an ecosystem in which programs can run. 


I'm not complaining so much as saying the video is a bit misrepresentative of bitcoin's utility.  As for usecase, if one really could attach code to individual amounts of bitcoin, the sky's the limit!  Who knows what sort of applications could be developed?

I bought in at $1000 and continued to buy in at $300 and everything between.  Am I putting my life savings into Bitcoin?  Of course not - that would be beyond foolish.  But I am buying small amounts (.5 BTC here and there) steadily.
I am not worrying about the current price, except that I love it being low because I can buy more.

My suggestion is that when tipping, you consider the experience you're "gifting" to whoever it is.  Are they going to be happy to:
1. get a message that they've got 50 bits ($0.02)
2. have to sign up with some site to get it
3. find out the amount is too small to withdraw
Most people experiencing this are going to be annoyed.  If you must tip, make your tips count.  Give someone $1 or so.

You should realize that your bitcoins are stored in a public ledger that exists across thousands of computers on the internet.  They're not just on your computer, they're everywhere.  For each address that you control that contains bitcoins, all that's needed to access the bitcoins is the address' private key.
Knowing that anyone who has your private keys can access your bitcoins anywhere in the world, the only safe way to store your bitcoins is to secure your private keys.  I recommend creating a paper wallet using an offline computer you can guarantee hasn't been compromised, and sending your bitcoin to that address.
