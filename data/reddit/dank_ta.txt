Not much of substance, they are basically just dropping crypto lingo and coin names in addition to the usual getting rich stuff. But it's two of the biggest names in german rap, so we are clearly getting into mainstream territory here.

Yeah well it's got nothing to do with bitcoin. The only reason for posting this is hoping for donations, even if you didn't specifically ask for it. And that is frowned upon here.

Now that's what I call a real HODLer.

Happycoins. Very fast with sepa (1 day) and only email needed.

Getting into r/nottheonion territory here...

Haha inb4 "big bang here, I am bitcoin!"

Blockfolio 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:09:09
Click on the coin, then on holdings (at the bottom). 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:00:30
No hate, just a little fun. Couldn't help myself when I saw the copycat posts with donation addresses pop up. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:04:51
It will go through at some point but it might take a while. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:18:53
Yes most of the alts can not be traded directly against USD so the dollar value is based on the BTC ratio. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:22:11
Haha thanks mate but even if you were serious, I have been so lucky this month, I would feel bad about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:57:36
Yeah because we all love and trust banks. The only thing you should sell because of this is ripple.

Bittrex works. It's called BCC on there. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:49:22
We are in still in the very early stages where the worth of these capabilities ist being evaluated. The volatilty will go down if Bitcoin gets more adoption.
Look, you sound like a nocoiner/buttcoiner so I´m not gonna waste my time trying to convice you that Bitcoin/crypto is the future. I'm just saying that you're wrong when you say "you can't do anything with Bitcoin"

...except transferring billions arround the world in seconds with near-zero cost. Or having them securely stored on a piece of paper. Or even just in your head. With no government being able to seize them.

Dude please stop spamming your blog. This is a tech community, we don't care if you discovered the invisible guy in the sky, maybe you should look for a dumber audience...

Hate to be that guy, but it's in Luxemburg and buying, not renting... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:17:55
I think you misunderstood me, my point was that a horsecart merchant has a vested interest. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:16:26
Bitpanda is one of the biggest btc sellers in Europe and it is based in Austria. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:00:38
Well then go ahead and put your money where your mouth is, I wasn't joking about bitmex. You will learn the same lesson that many others had to learn. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:21:17
Damn lizards! 
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:30:23
Yes you have to track all your trades (most exchanges can export csv files) and report your gains. If you trade crypto/crypto it gets even more complicated. There are sites that calculate this for you, but I'm no expert (I'm not in the US). 
Just use the search function on crypto subs or google, you'll find a lot of info on this.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:20:32
You only pay taxes on your gains. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:21:17
Damn lizards! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:18:41
First of all you should make a new account for crypto reddit. You just held up a sign saying "I'm into cryptos and have a shitload of money!" which makes you a prime target for scams, hacking and such. The more information these people can gather via your post history, the easier you make it for them. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:59:18
Use bitmex. You seem to be pretty sure of yourself so why not go 100x leverage? Have fun! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:25:58
Happycoins is a little expensive but lightning fast for sepa. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:43:13
It's like asking a horsecart merchant in 1910 what he thinks about cars. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:15:46
Ooops :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:37:33
Plot twist: its only because of the "What to do if you lose all your money through bitcoin" searches. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:28:53
There are only very few logical reasons why you would get so agitated over this. Could it be that you almost bought bitcoin at some point in the past, ultimately decided against it and now you're salty because you missed out? Or did you buy at 4900 and panicsold at a loss? Probably both... 
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:40:14
I just checked, there are 11 exchanges for LTC/USD on Blockfolio. You just have to add it as a new coin and delete the LTC/BTC pair.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:16:26
You can't profitably mine btc with gpus anymore. But I think the guys over at r/vtc were planning to do something like this... 
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:08:35
I don't think he envisioned bitcoin/crypto as a vehicle to grab 100s of millions for shitty PowerPoint presentations. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:44:54
Tbh an ico ban/regulation would be a good thing long term for crypto imo.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:42:47
This is the stupidest thing I have seen today. You could just as easily buy gold and bury it somewhere in the woods.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:32:16
I put money aside every paycheck, but I only buy on recoveries after "Ermagerd it's the end of crypto!"-moments. For example, I bought some this weekend after seeing the huge volume on the reversal on Friday. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:24:50
With margin you do. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:22:27
I would guess that they already bought, these guys didn't get where are by announcing their trades beforehand...
