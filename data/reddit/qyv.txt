If he's not found guilty, how will he prove the silk road assets (which is what these coins are) the government is selling are his?

See bbbbubble's comment above - it isn't in $big_corporation's interests to scam a few people's $5, $10, or even $50 (or .5 Btc if you prefer). They inherently have (or have built) trust and therefore wouldn't need a third party escrow.
Not to mention it can be assumed they will have the money in the event of a escrow situation unless they were in breach of that trust - hopefully I don't lose my train of thought while I'm driving, I'll expand on this when I get home

I run the cards at my company, although we are probably an edge case, here you go:
We only accept Visa, MasterCard and Discover (credit cards). We pay about 2.85% (we tell our customers 3%) of any transaction to CC processors (This is for each transaction, not a percent of our gross - we also accept check and cash (and if someone asked, I'm sure I could convince the owners to take Bitcoin). If we need to refund, we send a check. In the 9 months I've worked here, we've had 0 chargebacks, although we've had to send 2 refunds.
Our average number of transactions in a month are probably between 50 and 80. 
Our average transaction size is between $1,200 and $2,000, with edge cases as low as $75 (basically if we ship you an accessory) to $8,000. 
We've had several processing companies tell us they can't get our rate lower. 
Our annual gross is between $1.25 and $1.75 million, although it can vary year to year; Not exactly a large retailer, but there's some stats for you to look at from a small business.

To expand:
Unless the customer was trying to scam the $big_corp out of the product, the customer would approve the payment (under the current system, that is by doing nothing - the current banking system, the person receiving money says "xxx owes me $$" and unless xxx comes back and says "no I don't" the payment goes through). In that case, an escrow would actually be to the benefit for $big_corp as they already have systems in place for checking if merchandise was received.

Wouldn't do you any good - unless you just happen to be short 200k.. That's just the deposit. You have to place a bid on top of it. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:11:13
Depending on who you ordered from, you should have used an escrow. That's the whole point. If you get scammed, it's essentially your fault. It's exactly like you handing someone on the street some and asking them to go get you some lunch. They might come back with something, but why are you giving random people off the street cash without any form of guarantee?!

I don't have specific numbers for our margins, we design custom closets and storage systems (garage organizers, pantries, laundry rooms, etc). If I had to guess, I'd say we're probably around 10-20%. I know for sure 15% goes to the designers and installers, I'd say close to 40-60% goes into parts and materials (depending on how much we have to order out for any given job). And then there is the shop labor and office labor. I believe we pay corporate a fee for leads they send to us. Plus the designers don't (theoretically at least) have a specific hard sale point (they're suppose to call in if it's more then a X% discount off the national price, but most simply won't offer a better discount, even though we still have a bit of a margin). 
From the link someone else posted, my guess is that it's a bit higher because we do less quantity and higher dollar value transactions.

It depends entirely where you are located, but in general, you'd want to ask a lawyer or accountant for any legal advice on the subject. 
That said, I believe (and could be wrong) if you reported it on your taxes you should be okay.

In my opinion, this is one of the biggest problems right now. Bitcoin users are thinking "Hey, I want to pay you in BTC, so $1 is..." For Bitcoins to really work, we are eventually going to need a shift to, "Hey, I want to pay you, here's 8 mBTC." Unfortunately, this will probably remain as it is for a good while.
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:50:33
It's basically an artificial cap. Every 10 minutes (on average) a block is created and the network says "thanks" by giving out some extra bitcoins to some of the people that helped, but every 4 years (again, on average) that "thanks" only is half as loud (the number of bitcoins the network give out decreases by half). 21 million happens to be when the "thanks" becomes lower then .00000001 (the smallest unit of value that the network keeps track of).

Why don't you try reading up on them a bit before you try to buy them. There are some good sources on the sidebar.

From what I understand (and I'm at about the same point as you - new and with no btc to call my own - yet)
With regard to the first part, one only needs to download the entire chain if they are a "node" and at this point, due to the mining difficulty, if one really wants to mine, they need to have specialized hardware costing at the very least $1000, usually a bit more. A quick search on bestbuy.com for an external hard drive turned up several in the 1-2 TB range for under $100 So I don't think storage will be a problem in the near future (If you have the money for the mining equipment, an extra $100 for storage isn't a big problem). Additionally (and someone please correct me if I'm wrong) the system is set up such that the blockchain will increase in storage demands at a fairly constant rate. (There are on average 6 blocks created per hour and each block has a limit of 1MB(?) although right now we are averaging significantly less).
As for the second part.. I guess I'm unclear what you mean by "client." Bitcoin is really more of a protocol, and there already are numerous different (wallet) clients for users to interact with that protocol.

Bitcoin doesn't have a price it has an exchange rate. That being said, most merchants price goods/services in USD still.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:34:43
This is a lot more along the lines of my thinking. Very well worded. I was merely trying to point out that a shift in thinking about bitcoins would be needed before they are commonly accepted in everyday life (such as shopping for groceries, or the hamburger example above). 
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:40:09
You misunderstand. I'm not complaining at all. I'm simply stating that when bitcoins are accepted into everyday life, the way people will think about them should not include a conversion to USD or any other form of currency. People don't convert Yen to USD before they spend them, they simply know, "This shirt costs xxx amount and that's a good deal so I'll buy it." does a much better job explaining then I did.

Honestly, that read like a sales pitch to me. I would have liked to see more numbers and information. All I really got out of the article was "we should start using solar and here is somewhere you can buy them."

Additionally, each node has a copy of the blockchain, so when the internet goes back up, there might be a tiny bit of confusion about exactly where to start, but it wouldn't be much different that an orphan block. It's like having tons of off site backups. All over the world.

Might be someone sweeping a cold wallet (the 5000btc transaction). As for 3 blocks, it's 10 on average, so it's possible, or one of the blocks could be a fork/orphan.
