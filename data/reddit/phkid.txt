That's true BUT the atmosphere of HODLing for fear of it suddenly gaining value actually creates an community of non-users, just hoarders.

I'm not saying that your reason isn't true or valid but this is what it has turned to from what I can see. It may be pretty recent and I'm pretty new to the scene as well but this sentiment is what I get anywhere I look. Or maybe I am misunderstanding them? Though for sure those people who regret buying at &gt;16k isn't here for the tech.

no, he really is. Both communities are in their own ways. I mean look at you.

Kill the family and stop your problems.
Joking but this sounds more like a family problem than a general security problem. This is a literal trust no one issue. You shouldn't even tell your social circle at this point, they could also be the ones targeting you especially if they don't understand you can own a tiny little fraction of a bitcoin and not the whole pie.

Great timely post. A lot of people have become HODLers and forget that the only reason that bitcoin can gain adoption and real value is USAGE. Sure you can regret it later on but if you improved your situation in life and not just using this as a get rich quick scheme then you've already fulfilled a communal purpose that has been entrusted upon cryptocurrencies

The thing is you're a believer in the tech so you believe in the value that it is equal to banks BUT to the rest of the world the value is in the exchanges that turn it into fiat and BTC's monetary worth. Most of the world won't trust an entity they can't run after. In my country, iirc, more than 60% don't even hold a bank account. They do all transactions via cash, why would they convert to a currency with hefty fees? They just want a straight up conversion for their money and a tiny convenience fee like Western Union does.
I believe another problem for the ecosystem is the takeover of HODLers, the currency can only be successful if usage is mass adopted but the atmosphere in this reddit towards people who cash out and change their lives is volatile, even sometimes outright hostile. As it is right now, Bitcoin is digital gold, barely anyone but an investor trades gold in the real world or those who pawns them for usable currency. Unless this changes or Bitcoin gains a "cash-like" counterpart that is liquid and moving around society, it's not going to be valued as much as you hope it to be.
As an ecosytem for investment, I'll agree with your points. Every person with some knowledge on how to get into cryptocurrency will dip their toes into alt coin trading because it's an easier platform to get into over stock day trading.

I was able to do all that in under a week during the holiday season. :v

Thanks! Basically if I adopt the mindset I'm going to probably lose on my first 10 trades or so it wouldn't hurt so bad lol. Experience is the best teacher in this situation I suppose.

The last line is a very similar thing being said on the other sub about you guys. So frankly I just see you guys as like Christian sects trying to fight each other over who the best version of Jesus is.
Users in both places have their faults but the other side borders on exploiting this side's weaknesses vs this side being religious zealots about it. I'm new to the scene so this might be a recent thing but zealots don't really help.

no option to delete a coin you added on the dashboard?

I'm pretty new to the bitcoin scene like literally only weeks of reading and only a day into watching markets and I wondered if this was the reason why btc was crashing so far. It's so easy to see which exchanges have high/low buy/sell points. 
But I've only recently read about transactions being delayed for days also costing so high. Do inter-exchange transfers fall into those as well?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:33:03
So true. I honestly can't grasp how people can't connect the dots when coins in the market, all trading heavily with BTC, also go down when BTC value goes down.
I've only seen a difference once in the past few days when ETH and ETC rose while the rest dropped.

I've seen more people get banned from here though. The echo chamber here is very loud.

What metrics do I have to look for to consider an alt fast(er) moving? Time between transactions+transaction fee? Or is there something else to it?
