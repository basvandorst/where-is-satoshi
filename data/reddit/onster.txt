20 years later...
"Wow, thank you, uncle! Can I have the private key to my BTC wallet please?"
"It's safe in my paper wallet. I'll keep it for you for free."
On that day, your nephew learns an important life lesson:
**Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.**

Feels better to hodl the one true coin.

Did you join a mining pool? Did you use GPU?
If you answered "no" to either question, don't bother looking for your wallet.dat. You didn't lose anything valuable.

I just sold 16+ BTC and am waiting for a market correction to buy back more.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:18:46
You meant CAD$?

Give him a [bytcoin]( and apologize later for the unfortunate homophone.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:15:20
16 BTC isn't a lot, but there's only 16 million BTC in circulation right now. In that perspective, selling one millionth of ALL BTC in the world feels like a big deal.

Even though the firmware is open-source, I (as an end user) have no way to verify that the wallet is running the same code.

Yeah, looks legit.

An extra passphrase word only adds 12 bits of entropy. That's trivial to brute force. Also, at some point, you have to give the word to your HD wallet so that it can sign transactions for you.

Again, end users have no way to tell that Trezor's firmware actually runs the same piece of code.

"The company [Bloq] and others that helped create and promote the cryptocurrency will retain 2 million metronome coins, out of an initial trove of 10 million to be auctioned off in December."
Sounds like more profitable than implementing replay protection for B2X.

It's naive to assume that ASIC-resistance is always a desirable property. It could be cheap to attack an ASIC-resistant PoW by renting a huge amount of AWS/GCP instances for a short period of time. To attack an ASIC-friendly coin such as BTC, it requires a lot more capital to buy hardware that can't be easily returned or repurposed.

Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the first version of Bitcoin on Windows and Windows-only.

How could the guy turn a profit unless he's got a ton of GCP coupons?
6 MH/s generates slightly less than 100 XMR per day. That's about $8500 at today's rate. So this guy needs to keep the cost under $0.19 per instance per day just to break even. The cheapest GCP instance with one virtual core (preemptive n1-standard-1) costs $0.24 per day, which has no way to generate 133 H/s.

Were you saying that Satoshi, a Windows programmer, incompetent?

AntPool produced the most empty blocks. Why am I not surprised?

If Trezor prevails in the crypto community, people will store substantial amount of coins on their HW wallets, so it does make economic sense for the company to backdoor their device. I'm not saying they will, but we can't rule out the possibility.

The latest generation of RPi has only 1GB of mem. Bitcoin Core needs 2GB, doesn't it?

Nice try. Try harder next time.

This new replay protection mechanism checks all the output of a transaction and rejects it if a null data tx with a special signature (0x52503d213e3178, or "RP=!&gt;1x") is detected. It doesn't change the tx format or sig version. Very sloppy and shitty replay protection, though to be fair, this is slightly better than the previous attempt which would require the creation of tons of dust transactions.

About 170GB, and it grows by 4GB per month.

Thanks! What's the advantage of running a full node on Pi? Low energy?

I subscribe to Andreas's YT channel and watch every single new vid. I love that he cuts his hour-long talks into bite-sized clips for quick consumption.
