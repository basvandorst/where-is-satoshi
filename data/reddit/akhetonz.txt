The dip is now. I hope you got all your ducks in a row. TIME TO BUY

Do it, but have an exit point and stick to it.
Worked for me :)

Bank fees disproportionally hurt the poor and keep them in the cycle of poverty.

One of the purposes of bitcoin is banking the unbanked. Citizens in Ethiopia for example, who earn a median income of USD55 a month [according to this]( would not be able to afford a bank account that [charged withdrawal, deposit, payment and annual service fees ](

op pls

That doesnt make any sense. Hard forks inherently reduce the total value, the fact that 2x was called of means the price should go UP because theres less uncertainty and the community isnt being split.
Thw falling price makes 0 sense to me.

There has been a massive influx of noobs to r/bitcoin this last 3 months.

Ironic that he moves it to a Segwit address

I see the problem. If your employer isnt recieving payment in bitcoin, they cannot pay you in bitcoin without the involvement of a bank.
Therefore the only way to get the cycle going is to encourage merchants to accept bitcoin. Then they will be ready when employees ask for payment in bitcoin.

What happens if your car breaks down? What happens if you trip and break your arm and cant work for a month? What happens if you drop your phone and need to replace it? Do you have emergency savings that allow you to pay your car excess/ buy food for a month/ get a new phone? (~$500 might be enough if you live at home with your parents and don't drive a car. Only you can tell what is enough.)
Step 1: Save enough money to support yourself if an unexpected expense comes up. Unless your parents are able to 100% support you financially, e.g. pay for a new phone, drive you around ect.
Step 2: Figure out a rough weekly budget. How much $ do you spend on food? Phone bill? Going out with your friends? Having a girlfriend? Don't sacrifice your freedom as a young adult for Bitcoin, I promise its not worth it.
Step 3: Once you have some emergency buffer, and know how much you can put into 'savings', then you can buy bitcoin every week with the leftover money. Make sure you have enough cash available so that if you have an unexpected expense, you wont have to sell Bitcoin during a dip. And then HODL.
Don't tell any of your friends how much bitcoin you have. Don't leave them on an exchange. Make sure you have the private keys and DO NOT trust them to your family or friends.

I like the idea! How can we make this happen?

My friend, I bought at the last leak before the China news. Just hold on tight through the next FUD experiment and you will be glad you got in now!
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:23:10
Good luck friend
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:09:04
Exactly! This is the utility of Bitcoin! Instant, trustless, decentralized and an un-regulatable cash exchange. Why shouldn't two willing parties be able to trade goods and services without the use of a third party?

... This sounds really bad...
"give police and customs officers broader powers to search and seize physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments (BNI) and establish civil penalties for failing to comply with questioning and search powers;"

What a terrible shame. I feel so sorry for him and his family having to go through this.
But he should have paid for a better lawyer. 5 year's salary is way better than 2 years prison.

Yeah im in until bitcoin gets to 10k then im cashing out. I think its a great technology but it got very expensive very quickly. Big funds are already invested, r/bitcoin turned into a massive *moon* circlejerk. Its been all over the news, celebrities have been talking about it so FOMO/noob investors are still getting in.
These are red flags I personally cannot ignore when taking emotion out of the equation. Im gonna take my initial investment out and wait for the next major dip.

I 100% agree we (users) need some kind of protection from miners hijacking the protocol. They work for us after all!! Otherwise it's just going to keep happening and they're going to cause so much confusion when they don't really have a say.
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:20:08
I honestly feel like we are at Desperation. I would like to see the price go up like everyone else, but what I have noticed in this sub is that when the price goes up 5-10% people celebrate, post memes etc. And when it goes down 10% people are mad and confused and there are many "What did I miss? Why is it going down??" posts and they lash out at whales, tether, china, FUD, anything they can to satisfy their need for justification. I'm skeptical that this recent run up to 7500 is a symptom of market desperation and our morale is going to be pounded further.
