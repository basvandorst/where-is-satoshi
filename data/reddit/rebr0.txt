You’re talking about a hold strategy on a high risk investment, and you’re surprised about a hedge against losses when losses are all but guaranteed?

This is a tinfoil hat red herring, and an oversimplification of my argument. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:31:53
If bitcoin is seen by major institutions as being a more effective means to pay for crimes, major institutions won't adopt it, fewer people will use it, and the currency will naturally be devalued over time. On top of the natural deflationary nature of BTC, this creates even more deflation. 
I can use a 100 year old nickel, and it's still worth a nickel. In 100 years, how much will that Bitcoin be worth if nobody uses it?

I've answered this elsewhere. Cash is already the standard, therefore doesn't have any barriers to adoption.

Forks don't facilitate crimes. Forks also aren't inherently advantageous to be used in perpetrating crime. People don't pay for crime with forks. Etc., etc. 


This isn't the issue. The issue is that it protects the identities of those transacting which means that it's naturally advantageous for crime. 
The only reason this argument is tenacious is because it's the primary reason that many major corporations use to justify their non-adoption.

Ha - thanks for the candor! 
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:45:02
Exactly, but the difference is that USD (cash) has already been accepted as the standard. What's the point in switching over to another standard when there are obvious issues with it? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:15:24
The difference is that cash has already been adopted as standard, and is arguably easier to trace to a party (serial numbers, fingerprinting, dye bags, residues, etc). 
Bitcoin creates a natural protection for those interested in using it to fund illegal activity. This is what I mean when I say that the things that give Bitcoin an advantage become disadvantages when viewed through this lens.

It's one and the same, I'm arguing that Bitcoin would need some sort of prevention or gatekeeping in order to allow for adoption by major institutions. Cash is the current standard.

I appreciate the response. 
BTC seems like a wonderfully smart and efficient means to pay for transactions, and the transparency it naturally provides is simply wonderful. The reduction of fees can only improve velocity and fungibility of currency, and I look forward to the day when something like it gets adopted widely. 
My problem is (and you can see it here in this thread) that adopters of BTC seem to scoff at the major concerns raised by the parties who will ultimately drive its widespread adoption (that is, banks, financial institutions, investors, retailers, etc). These parties are *deeply* concerned about what I've raised here, and with the community being somewhat obstructive to finding a solution to these concerns, it's hard to imagine a world where BTC gets the improvement it needs to be adopted widely. 
As I see it, there's massive potential for another cryptocurrency to move in, one that plays with the transparency/anonymity toggles.

You're not getting the question though. What's the point of adopting a new technology if it has the same (or worse) issues as the current standard?
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:36:47
Good point. It's odd to me that transparency and privacy are sort of interchangeable with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:45:31
Seriously? 
A fiat currency's value is determined exactly by how other people use the currency. If the vast majority of the population refuses to use the currency, there's no point in adopting it. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:42:18
It's like I'm on r/conspiracy.
Adoption means exactly what I think it means: people using it. Aggressive estimates have BTC's usership at around .013% of the world's population. That's less than the population of Austin, TX. 
The rest of your post has absolutely nothing to do with what I'm asking. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:22:01
Thank you for the wonderful reply. 
The only solution my brain could come up with was something similar - some sort of "verified party" status on Bitcoin. But how on earth would that get regulated or overseen? 
Anyway, this is all wonderful information, thank you for your insight. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:11:52


This is the root of my question. I doubt that a solution is truly impossible. 


Sure, it's easier to prove an exchange, but harder to track the parties in the transaction. And I'm not sure of the coding limitations, but if public/private keys are the only thing linking a party to a transaction, doesn't that mean that framing/deception are even easier with BTC than they would be with cash?
