Because every major exchanger supplies coins used in illegal transactions later down the road (no pun in tended)

tldr; He is being held responsible for the fact that people used his service to later buy products on the silk road. Because he allowed people to operate pseudoanonymously and the silk road did as well, a conspiracy is implied.
I know this community likes to downplay bad news sometimes, but this is really important.

I'm going to set my own: Bust at major round numbers:
In the past: $100, $200,$1000
In the future: $1500, $2000, $5000.

They avoid saying he was in contact, and if they *could* claim that directly I'm sure they would(it is a press release, after all).
There's "facilitating the conversion", and "enabled its users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously", "knowingly allowed", and discounts tied to *high volume transactions* but no allegation of direct communication I see related to drugs.
They chose their words carefully. Read them carefully.

Yeah, did. What I said is accurate.

They also got broken into themselves(large scale) just a few months ago...

If you run a bitcoin exchange, you're servicing SR users and you know it. I don't think anyone is naive enough to think otherwise.
Edit: It's the truth folks. You think Mt. Gox isn't aware the coins they produce has been used for SR transactions?
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:14:39


All that really alleges is that he knew some coins would be used in SR, which is true for anyone doing exchange. The complaint quite carefully avoids saying he went out of his way to find SR/drug related clients. They closest they come is a high volume discount not tied to drugs...

It's traceable, but only to a bitcoin wallet, not to an identity. It's much easier to burn a bitcoin wallet address than it is to burn an identity.

Because you generally order a certificate for X number of *years*. You don't wake up every morning and think "I wonder if my certificate has expired" on that kind of time line.

I am aware of nothing that would allow that. And either way: without a subpoena an IP is almost useless. It will likely change quickly.

This makes sense to me. I wouldn't want to be disclosing security vulnerabilities on my real name...especially when it involves real money. You don't know how the site owner or someone profiting off of the glitch will react.

Page views are an expense. Ads are revenue. Reddit has a lot of people using adblock, plus they have lower than normal prices for ads because it's users aren't great to advertise to in the first place. Combine that with not allowing "dirty" ads(that pay more) and you have a major financial problem.

Anybody notice this message is being repeatedly spammed?
As I said before: When disclosing security vulnerabilities(or in this case shutting down the site) it makes sense to use sockpuppets. You know for sure at least one person(the site owner) was making money that you're negatively impacting and in all likelihood there's someone who found the same glitch as you profiting from it.
You don't know how they will react. It makes sense to use a sockpuppet when you don't know who you'll piss off.

None of this means you shouldn't at least attempt to keep things civil. Keeping track of, shaming, and removing those who open the community up to attack is *part* of protecting yourself.
It's called [security culture]( and it works.

I'm seeing startcom as well. Looks like the cert was purchased on 4/12. Odd.
Edit: Now I'm seeing Verisign...wtf

I've worked with a lot of dating sites and there are some serious issues with that..namely that the bread and butter of dating sites is recurring billing.
