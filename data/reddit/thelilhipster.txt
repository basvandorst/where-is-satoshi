Here is a question I'd like to ask:


So what is everyone screaming about? you think a bigger block size is the end-all solution?    
It's already there, run one of their nodes if you wish.
Is the real problem the consolidated mining power in china and the deal/promise they have made with core?    
This has tied up majority consensus, so we're at mercy to them rather than a free market?
If that's the case, then BTC is effectively as crippled as fiat.    
It means all we've done is _exchange_ the conglomerates for a more centralized handful of developers - _the decentralization is a lie._
1. Core has the mining majority hostage due to the threat of a PoW change.
2. Therefore core has control over majority consensus.
3. Therefore core is in control over centralization of BTC.
**Edit:** This is a genuine question, educate me if I'm completely off-base here - please!

I admire you're persistence to respond with rationality, but as you can see it's a community of blind circle jerks on both sides.
We'll be filtering through this sort of biased trash until the day we die.

Now just forget about it buddy.    
Don't go buying pot with your new magic internet money (like I did).
That $300 two years ago, [would of been like $5,000 today](

No conflict, no duality, no division.    
What is the value of such cooperation?
  
Consensus is democratic not technocratic.    
The core team are not dictators of consensus, for better _or_ worse.
The miners, those hosting nodes and the general user-base are consensus - and they have spoken.    
Core needs to adapt to the needs of the market, or they risk losing the leverage they currently have on the tech.

Bitcoin _is_ what bitcoin _does_, regardless of how you want to label it.


Not sure what your point is here.
 
The entire foundation of BTC is decentralized virtual currency - self regulated through consensus.    
In layman's terms - a democracy.
I'm not stating a _should_, I'm stating an _is_.    
If you want to argue semantics, go ahead - but you're just wasting your own time.
