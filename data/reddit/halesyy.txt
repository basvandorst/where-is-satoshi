Sell your Bitcoin and buy Rhino horns.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:24:12
I've been CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS and I've found there's a total of like 50,000 Rhinos right now. I'm going to be the first man to value Bitcoin in its EXACT, TRUE value...
21 million bitcoin / 50,000 rhinos = 410
Price of rhino horn 300,000 / 410 = $731 
From my precise mathematics I've decided Bitcoin is worth $731 dollars. fuck.
Edit: �� Rhino market cap of 15 billion dollars

Do you think you'd be able to grind the horn into a fine powder and use that? Rhinoshi.

Thank you very much :) I've found some PHP libraries which allow me to generate wallets, I was just wondering if the public address and private key act as a login and if there are any websites I can find that I can login to my Bitcoin address using that data?
I was thinking of something similar to  where you just throw your private key into the website.

I use CoinJar for my coffee, I have a Bitcoin CoinJar Swipe (works tjrkohj EFTPOS) card which I can use at any station in Australian. Absolutely brilliant in my words, I can live off only my bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:14:06
Thank you I appreciate your help! What I was wondering was if I generate bitcoin addresses and they aren't anywhere and try to access them elsewhere and I have my private key and public address, am I able to? I understand the address is on the bitcoin blockchain buy does it exist when generated?

So what I'm thinking we're meant to do is solve the probability for the different variables q in the header that you have posted in the number dump (0.1, 0.2, 0.35) and reproduce them for the variables given for us in Z and we might get an array that has the seed for the address?? Just an idea, not sure... We'd have to replicate this C code though:
(Will try and replicate this now)

More that I have found: The dates are directly involved with the references in the conclusion, going to look further into the links.
So far the dates that I have found to be quotes to the conclusion are: (use ctrl+f)
Most likely more, I just haven't found the right combo + looked at the original image in a bit.

No. I asked her and she said they have made a few applications such as converting old bank statements into smart contracts on the blockchain, as well as some other applications using blockchain. To "no idea what to do" I meant to elaborate and truly meant "no idea what the heights are for blockchain"

@_date: 2017-11-24 05:45:46
I talked to her and she said they were dabbling in Ethereum over Bitcoin for the management of their contracts INTO smart contracts. I think that Ripple and Quantum also have their benefits and I'm sure they'll get into them too!
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:45:02
Yeah it was a hard one since the second half of the assignment asks to lay it out in a simple and conveying manor, so I had to take the hard Bitcoin aspects and simplify them.
Also took the piss out of banks to get some extra expressions in ��
But yes, all grammar and formal.

I've put a small amount of money into the website just to see if it's real, I'm trying to get in contact with the team right now to see if there's any backing to it or assurance.
I'm completely sceptical about this service but I've seen others that are similar just at smaller returns which makes me a bit less sceptical.

Upvoted for stating that programmers love to give advice but hate coding for people and thinking of solutions for people. I'm never sure how to advise a new programmer and not get them to leech off of me.

I understand your ideology entirely and I completely have scepticism on the website, I'm young I'm taking a risk which is one of the decisions to do this. But I've seen a lot of past and present scam sites and I don't think this one quite rings the same bells as they did. I think it'll just turn into something like Bitconnect and fit into those schemes.

I mean from reading it, I gathered that the more you deposit the higher your chance of taking the entire pot get, so if you put 0.001 in a 0.01 pot, you have 10% chance to get it, so on. Just my guess from reading the How It Works bit. :)
