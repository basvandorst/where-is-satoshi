Maybe suspicious to people who never traded before the cryptohype

"Ever believed in promises made only to find out that you believed misinformation? Lies? I have."
You seem to be one hell of a trader.

You can't know that for sure.

nothing really, they just try to diminish fud with that article to shill bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:22:31
I think you are confusing savings banks with investment firms.

With online banking in europe there is not really a need for bitcoin for daily usage IMO. No Fees and you just send the money from the banking app and done.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:24:42
you should think neither. it is just a business offering a service in exchange for money no reason to give it these human characteristics.

yeah but inflation is not bad per se. deflation is way worse and that is what you have with bitcoin. you need to have inflation for money to work.

Well, first of all you don't need to be such a cunt and start insulting me.
And I get the feeling that the difference between an investmentfirm and a savings bank is way more distinct here where I am living, in Germany, than it is where you are from which i guess is the United States of America.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:25:51
Deflation is still way worse, no doubt about it. And here in Europe we are hitting our 2% goal quite well.

Why do so many people here think banks are evil? lol
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:02:17
You said the banks are institutions that have evolved to scam the masses but most people only get in contact with the savings banks for their account and applying for a loan to buy a house. Those Banks you are calling "evil" are the investment firms. When it comes down to any kind of crypto currency replacing fiat, the "evil" investment firms couldn't give less of shit about it. It would mostly affect the savings banks and those are not evil but as i said just offer a service.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:39:45
I pay 3€ a month for having a banking account and thats it. And for the service I am getting this is completely ok in my book. 
People always assume that banks make their money or most of the money with fees regarding you bank account which is not true at all. Most of the money is made with lending money to business or customers. And for that, bitcoin with it's volatile character is not suited at all.

i have the feeling that a lot of people who are into bitcoin have no idea about the real world and about how inflation and real money works tbh.
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:55:43
dont act like you dont know what i mean
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:45:56
nah bitcoin will never replace money
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:14:25
idk people who cant accept the loss of money and the destruction of the their dream of becoming rich?
