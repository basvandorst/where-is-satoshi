If anything investing in a mining company is probably the thing to do, because they can constantly convert their data center to mine the better future currency or process whatever else if bitcoin dies. Those mining centers is still hardware that can be used for something else

What are these Geopolitical Risks? Do they mean Trump?

I'm also not 100% familiar with the term fork, hence the initial confusion of whether it was a part of it or completely separate

To me they both have hype, I got just say fuck it and jump in already, it took me two years to figure out TFSA/RRSP and ETFs cause no one ever taught me a thing about financial management - but thankfully figured it out that now I want to put some points in some risky/hail-mary type investments

Another quick question, it seems like anyone can make a cryptocurrency now, even Razer apparently has one - which something about it doesn't make sense to me. And now there's Ethereum being hyped as well. 
More or less for someone who wants to toss 5k to 10k into Crypto and just forget about it for a couple of years - is there anyway to make sure you picked a solid coin that won't dissolve for another better one later one, is that possible considering code can be updated and whatnot?

So novice here - Bitcoin Cash or BCash - is a completely different and separate currency right and network right?
I read something that Bcash was a fork so I thought it was like a micro currency to bitcoin like the metric system for some reason

Privately, server farms, etc, - I think the tech will be adopted primarily for security and speed - but honestly read into it - more or less any advantage bitcoin has a currency will be adopted to existing USD, etc - minus the deregulation.

Miners won't be involved.

They'll just make their own block chain - it's not the currency it the tech behind it, which has already been emulated 100 times over
