Yet other chain block has less transactions that take up more space.
That means each transaction has many inputs and outputs. That means batching.
Large transactions with more data in OP_RETURN won't show that same result, but they could also batch too
This is exactly what people are advocating for here in bitcoin, except today the community is upvoting this exact outcome on the other chain as criticism. Come on guys, keep it classy. Even if it is different uninformed people, what is visible is what masquerades as consensus here.

You know if the mempool is clear and everyone is using lightning then bitcoin doesn't become a scarce resource anymore in the near term.
You need to provide compelling counterpoints to why the price would rise in the face of this massive supply coming back onto the markets.
Around 80% of bitcoin in unique addresses couldn't move because the amounts were smaller than the transaction fee.
That becomes no longer true with the things you are ironically bullish about. With only considering these factors, Bitcoin only becomes a scarce and more valuable resource after there is SO MUCH activity on Lightning that the openings and closings of payment channels clogs the mempool again. Yes it would be competing with VISA at that point.
I have other reasons to see Bitcoin as a bullish asset, but not what you wrote.

Cryptocurrencies spread through all levels of society by self-interest.
It was designed this way, and it works this way. It is a self propagating network that works by co-opting human greed.
If it is considered corruption for one segregated class of society to act in their self interest, then this is purely happenstance and highlights the incompatibility and antiquated nature of the differing governance protocols.
The network and concept works as intended. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:27:23
Yes I agree. Thanks
The block space scarcity keeps many funds in transit and not available on exchanges. At time of writing even with a fairly empty mempool there are 8600 BTC in limbo, which represents $94,000,000 in value.
Lightning Network's impact on scarcity is a long term outcome and it looks like thats why we are talking past each other.

Aaaaaah, there it is! ��
So people slowly deplete their payment channel unless they get funds back in the opposite direction, in addition to more and more funds getting added into a payment channel.
Can the additional funds have their own separate payment channel? Like can users have multiple payment channels at once? I'm thinking thats what your last thought was referring to
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:19:53


But all channels are connected to the network of channels, including the ones in your wallet/address right? Therefore you could just top up your other channel with funds in your ... other other channel

\&gt; "Inflation is taxation without representation." Explain how it is taxation
well I don't usually subscribe to this phrasing, but I can point out the similarities because of how inflation is accomplished:
Inflation is typically done by the US Treasury issuing newly created Treasury bonds onto the market, these bonds are interest bearing versions of the same paper-notes we use and become part of the US currency's money supply (The Federal Reserve buys and sells many of these directly from the US Treasury or to/from other investors on the open market to expand or contract the money supply, the Fed buys these bonds using money that didn't previously exist and this is now in the whole system)
This new money is revenue for the government, and to do that it also dilutes the purchasing power of everyone else using that currency, proportionally to the amount of new money created. US Treasury in combination with other factors, aims to reduce everyone's purchasing power by 2% every year.
The similarity to taxation is that taxes are revenue for the government, and lowers the purchasing power of everyone it just taxed, because the government has their money and that person doesn't anymore.
I like to note that this observation is the same whether the tax rate is 1% or 75%, because some people reply to any critique of a tax system with "but muh roads and schools".

Not necessarily. A lot of the price is because of the constricted supply maintained by the transaction backlog. This is analogous to high oil prices when a pipeline is destroyed in a conflict zone. Helping it flow again will bring prices lower due to the abundance.
With bitcoin, New market participants may find it useful, as well as diversified participants may come back into bitcoin as it is more useful again, this can counteract the supply abundance.

Tether maintains its peg by issuing more. Why is it so hard to believe that people already in crypto want stable value and buy Tether, if they buy too much then the peg will go above $1.00, the way to decrease the value is to issue more Tether
People outside of crypto also move their money into Tether.
There is no writing on the wall, only assumptions. Every time they issue some isn't a big deal. Tether was trading for $1.04 in the biggest bull rally this space has seen, that means a 4% greater number of tethers have to be issued for it to go back to $1.00

I can congratulate them, I am glad at what they have done and are committed to doing in the bitcoin ecosystem. I am glad they are applying themselves with the resources they have. Many wealthy people are not doing it.
The circumstances that allow them to do it are simply not exceptional, it is routine, mundane, typical, and don't run counter to any socioeconomic pattern. Wealthy family's sons go to Ivy League school.  Sons get exposed to upper echelon network and situations at Ivy League School. There is nothing improbable about that. It is nice they applied themselves and were able to pay their lawyers, a fact we agree on!
What is the fallacy in the argument? Survivorship bias is a reductionism, it doesn't ignore the individual circumstances that people have to navigate, it merely points out where others would not have survived no matter how great their business acumen, drive, or feelings were. They would simply have been encumbered by a lack of resources to support themselves.

The lightning network merely needs a fix for malleability of which segwit is but one solution.
There are malleability fixes that work on bitcoin cash or any network without segwit.
Hence lightning network will work on bitcoin cash.
Note: Therefore, Lightning network will also work on bitcoin transactions that don't use segwit, if another malleability fix is merged into bitcoin. This could happen as long as it isn't conflicting with segwit code, but unlikely to happen.
This has nothing to do with ideological differences, this is how the technology works. Did I miss something?

Applications can be built on top of Storj.
Currently the content creator would pay the farmers for storage. And (in one of many different possible scenarios) the farmers would also have to pay when files are transferred to a requestor. Using this as an example, the funds do not go to the content creator.
But it is feasible for farmers or intermediary software to have tagged data shards, and the tag can be a software instruction to route a payment to the content creator. We are just talking about cryptographic hashes representing cryptocurrency addresses after all, so therefore this would not be a technological feat given the current infrastructure.
I should make it clear that I just thought this up, based on what I know about Storj and having read the white paper. And that this is not a default functionality of Storj, but a possible functionality of it's application layer. If you read the white paper you should be able to synthesize possible applications as well.

(assume "short term capital losses" for everything I'm about to say)
If you have ONLY have losses in all your trades in your portfolio, then you can deduct $3000 this year and roll over $500 next year.
If you have some other investments that you realized gains in this year, then you can deduct as much of your losses against your gains until you have gotten your capital gains tax down to zero.
If you have ONLY losses this year, greater than your $3000 deduction, then you can use the remaining amount of losses ANY TIME WITHIN THE NEXT 7 YEARS to offset tax on capital gains! So when you have a particularly profitable year but have to write a big check to the IRS you can deduct that horrible 2014 loss against that big check.

Some bitcoin faucets are autonomous robots on the internet using humans to further their goals.
For instance, they might be trying to make accounts on websites, but can't get past a captcha. The robot will then wait and serve the captcha image to the next human that visits it's bitcoin faucet. It will then pay the human bitcoin and continue it's autonomous spread with it's new gmail account.
The robot could have been funding by a human creator, or it could have mined those bitcoin on it's own (or cheaply with an altcoin and traded them for bitcoin when that altcoin was valuable). The amounts faucets pay are small so this isn't unfeasible to mine enough to keep humans coming back.

Okay, the security of the blockchain is very important, and this is a factor of computational power directed at the blockchain, giving it a high hash rate. 
People have created and attempted to maintain blockchains that run more efficiently than bitcoin. There are plenty of examples of more adaptive difficulty algorithms, faster confirmation times, smarter block rewards, you name it. But many of those networks experience 51% attacks very early on, and they were rendered useless because the miners were not interested in trying to kick the large miner off the network.
I think you are assuming I'm an anti altcoin person or only pro bitcoin person, and this is not correct. I see that there are a lot of valuable blockchain experiments happening that simply cannot operate within bitcoin, right now. I have evaluated a lot of the issues you have brought up, I think you would be better off debating this with someone else, because we don't disagree, nor have we added more to the discussion OP was talking about.

1) "possible to break 51% or what happens next?" right, explain in a coherent sentence what you think quantum computers can do to bitcoin. First, identify your actual concern, Second, ask yourself, is that concern unique to bitcoin? Third, then we can address that actual concern.
2) Difficulty can decrease. Some people will always be able to subsidize their electricity. Machines are more energy efficient all the time. Lower difficulty will mean other miners take the place, as they all compete for the block reward or transaction fees.

If you don't recognize that kind of advertising as made for ABSOLUTE newbs, like, the most gullible potential traders in the world, then you deserve to lose your hard earned money.
It is one of those single page CLICK TO LEARN MORE websites that redirects you to a completely different single page site with a video spill of unknown length, that ultimately will be about day trading, but will be billed as some secret formula that you can get for the limited special price of $XX.XX per month. BUT WAIT IF YOU ACT NOW IT IS 10% OFF
Yes OP, it is possible to trade bitcoin and make consistent 20% or 30% gains and reinvesting those proceeds into your initial capital. You can do this in any market and bitcoin happens to be volatile enough for this to happen often.

a) Have more than one credit/debit card, from different institutions. This is for everyone else, not your brother who is already in this situation. It is about avoiding drama. In October alone I have had three situations where a credit card was either frozen, or the institution decided to replace it, or it otherwise not able to be used. But these were drama free situations for me because I simply used a different card to complete a purchase.
b) There might be a bitcoin ATM around. Unlikely though and the rates suck, but you never know where people have set them up yet. Anyway, this would allow him to swap any bitcoin he has to the local currency, Euros.
c) Tell him to call his bank and unfreeze his card. Wow so complicated. Many institutions let their users do this online as well.

In this example of 1000 bits = 1 million usd, no it would not. There was a [paltry] volume of $8.13 million in the last 24 hours. 
This does not oversaturate the market.
Similarly, bitcoin's utility becomes greater to larger entities the higher it's market cap is and the deeper its liquidity gets. As they also would not be interested in moving the market dramatically, for a mundane transaction. With that in mind, liquidity begets liquidity and there can be many recurring market participants to sell to at the higher price.

It is a weak argument as only SHA256 ledgers are losing to bitcoin or diluting bitcoin's hashing power
Some blockchains secured by other algorithms have their available computational market tapped too, and are not at risk for a 51% attack
But everything merge mined with litecoin - as an example due to the security of the hashing power - can share in the redundancy of sidechains. Even Namecoin on bitcoin's blockchain. It's merge mining won't disappear simply because bitcoin gets a sidechain that may duplicate the efforts of namecoin.
Even with two or three blockchains having sidechains with every possible feature someone can come up with for a sidechain, it will be obvious how completely redundant it is and fail to kill altcoins as proponents anecdotally suggest
It will not be a value proposition for bitcoin, and Blockstream's 21 million will be wasted, for investors.
If the sidechain idea pans out, it will still be useful for the crypto space

These laws exist because when people are confronted with an ultimatum between wealth, luxury, political power for generations on end VERSUS the unemployment line at age 50, they will do things that screw thousands upon thousands of people to avoid the latter outcome.
Share issuance laws are to deter this kind of behavior. I really think you guys have no idea how bad it gets! I've seen some shit.

There has been a bubble with a 90% price retracement and 18 months of price stagnation, with businesses shutting down their bitcoin operations completely.
Nothing in 2014 was like that at all, and the price could barely reach 75% off highs. It doesn't even need rationalizing or justification except for people's high cost basis.

No it is not worth it to invest in a rig.
Two years ago, $5000 would have been a more adequate investment into a mining computer. The investment costs are now into the millions of USD, and these are manufacturers of mining machines in data centers at this point.
With your $200 you cannot contribute a service to the network for it to pay you in bitcoins. You can contribute a service to a human being instead that is willing to pay you in bitcoin.

an "unlikely break in the hashing algorithm, things that can rewrite history" cannot happen because the revisions will not match the same hash. Even if NOBODY ELSE was storing the whole blockchain, people will still have the hashes to the blocks and at least see that the revisions do not match those hashes.
This is not a faith based thing, I am open to new information that disproves my understanding of how this works. The issue would be related to the ability to mask new relevant information into the same hash as other data. This would involve both being able to get ANY arbitrary data pattern to match a hash, and then it would involve being able to get non-arbitrary non-corrupt data to also match that hash, to therefore masquarade as a title transfer or whatever meta technology is reliant on that hash and then we would be back at square one in general, not a bitcoin specific problem.

1) Infrastructure and first mover advantage.
Altcoins do not have infrastructure - there is nobody transacting on most of those networks, nor SPV clients, nor anyone using BIPs, and are experiments just like bitcoin in an experiment. If any of these altcoins actually does something useful or revolutionary, it will be forked into bitcoin. Nobody will have to switch or anything because bitcoin will be able to adopt equivalent technology.
2) two references about price.....  you can buy bitcoin with 10 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc. The price of bitcoin or any alt coin is irrelevant. They are all infinitely divisible.

Bob buys some electronics. Alice LLC now has Bob's bitcoins.  Alice LLC puts Bob's bitcoins on bitstamp and immediately hits the bids which makes lower bids remain. The bidder is satisfied and is now removed from the market.
There are 500 Bob's. Now, for illustrative purposes, 500 bidders are now removed from the market, leaving only the lower bidders limit orders on Bitstamp, after the Bob buys electronics from Alice LLC.

If many miners can't pay electricity and this is cost prohibitive, then they will leave the network.
If many miners leave the network, difficulty decreases and the remaining block reward is split between the remaining miners.
The remaining miners are getting more BTC than they were before. This has nothing to do with halving.
We are not at the point where transaction fees need to be increased. Transactions with fees will eventually wean the network off of the block reward subsidy, no matter what happens.

You are misguided.
This has nothing to do with abstract sense of money or currency designations.

Since any case regarding anything illegal will go to the courts, you might want to consider that, ONLY.
Secondly, getting around prostitution prohibitions has nothing to do with whatever gifting framework you just made up. Stop browsing Backpage escort ads for your legal policy.

Bitcoin price first got to $80 in March or April 2013, after being $2-$10 for all of 2012. oops.
Your trading strategy had flaws as you saw at least one bitcoin bubble burst with a 81% selloff, but expected the $1000 bubble to only decline 20-30%. It took almost 2 years for bitcoin's price to recover from its first bubble in 2011, which experienced a 90% selloff. But I understand that percentages might not be everyone's thing.

You either shouldn't have bought in a $750, based on the anatomy of every single bubble in bitcoin history (dubious rally ending with Mt. Gox servers crashing causing massive illiquidity till 75% below the peak price) being the exact same as this one.
You shouldn't have made a large position size at $750 if you felt there was opportunity for the price to increase BEFORE it finished falling. Instead you could have averaged in to continue lowering your cost basis dramatically, instead of buying at random prices, you could have bought again at $350, or even the low of $275 this year. But this is hindsight as you probably blew all your capital on the initial purchase and the subsequent purchases at random higher prices.
You could have short bitcoin via swaps, all year, in one awesome downtrend.

It is just additional information. It complements the first thing I said. Hm, I should have wrote that in either situation if you have greater losses than your gains in other investments even after you offset the taxes on those gains this year, then you can still wait to use those losses against more gains in the next 7 years.

The point is that you don't need electricity and internet connections to use bitcoin, yet people from afar could still make sure that victims still get funded instead of a centralized organization like a corrupt government or an opaque aid group peer pressuring people to donate to them.
This is separate from getting basic food and shelter to the region.
When rudimentary infrastructure returns, there are unbanked people who still lost everything. They would be able to trade for goods and services with a funded bitcoin addresses even without internet connection.

There have been hard forks in the bitcoin network before. The devs can act when there is actual external pressure to act.
Regarding what happens in a 10 minute window in that extreme event, if the miner decides to double spend, the whole network will know immediately.
What will happen is that merchants will be advised not to accept transactions. And, this is part of the economy is highly centralized, bitpay will be aware and just shut off that functionality. The darknets will be aware, etc. A lot of economic activity stalls because this is due to what will happen next:
The other nodes will reject that longest blockchain, through a variety of ways. By rejecting and orphaning that entire branch of the chain, all of those transactions will no longer have happened. Reversing payments that happened during that time. There are also alternative ways to handle this, as seen with the Vertcoin community deciding not to rollback the blockchain.
What happens during the 10 blocks in 10 minutes matters very little. 
But there is actually a lot to say about mitigating double spends that I don't want to type, you will have to look up a different thread discussing this.
Essentially, these events stall economic activity for short periods of time. A malicious miner cannot affect your holdings of bitcoin, they can temporarily disrupt new transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:37:00
both transactions won't be included in a block
nodes will reject the second transaction they see anyway
whichever one gets seen first AND included in the block will be the valid one
whichever block chain is the longest and accepted by the most nodes is the true chain which includes the transaction that was seen in that chain
comes down to luck which one gets propagated to the nodes first, the software takes care of the rest
the end.

Undataminable isn't true. A substantial amount of keys are available in mixin 0, 1, and 2 transactions, until there is a hard fork which rejects mixin 0, 1 and 2 transactions from poor implementations on exchanges like Poloniex, then there is a key set which can deduce information about originating user.
But sure, this doesn't show balances or the address behind the stealth address in any way.
Just allows you to deduce the key to an individual party, in some circumstances.

darkwallet obelisks can still see a lot of information about each transaction!
But lets say John set up his own obelisk in TOR, then he can keep the data to himself, but the next problem:
also, nobody knows the liquidity at any given time in darkwallet. If there is nobody to mix with, then darkwallet will not mix your coins at all! so if the stealth address recipient address ever spent the funds it will link back to the origin without stealth!
=== next solutions:
The altcoin darkcoin's darksend network has a similar issue with masternodes. They see too much information.
Monero, using the parameter of mixin 3 or greater, works better for this partially because the entire network is using stealth addresses.

Out of like 800 alts you found a problem with one development team in one alts?
but yes, there are only 5 to 8 alts worth looking at. Really exciting stuff happening. Bitcoin brought the blockchain to the world, Bitcoin-CLI will not be the only blockchain application, yet all blockchains have a token.
It is very naive to think that none of those tokens will ever have periods of utility that can exceed bitcoin's
When you have any single no-name US equity with a higher market cap and trading volume than all of bitcoin and cryptocurrency combined. All it takes is for one blockchain to have a seriously controlled launch from movers and shakers to attract and command much higher use. And this has nothing to do with consumer/merchant adoption.
Bitcoin is like a steam locomotive. Everyone laid the tracks down for it, amongst booms and busts in the railroad sector, but nobody uses steam locomotives anymore. Analogies compare unrelated things with similarities, in case anyone was unfamiliar, so the similarity here is that people are building infrastructure to move cryptocurrency. Hopping on to a different network will be a piece of cake.

Bitcoin is a political response to the central banking system. The very first bitcoins mined (the genesis block) contain an encoded message about the approval of the second bailouts, and the bitcoin network has continued autonomously since then.
Bitcoin exists in parallel to those institutions and governments and undermines everything that they do. 
So yes, politics can be alienating, but there is no denying it's roots.

No. I would like to debate you on the semantics but this isn't reality.
Morgan Stanley was leveraged 47:1 at the height of the housing bubble. If they had $1 million in assets they were trading with $47,000,000 instead. This wasn't from simple corporate funds or prior year's capital and profits. It was a fungible mix of all money they had in all aspects of their coffers.
This is how all the institutions are functioning. If they violated a law about speculating with customer's deposits, they pay the fine on it and try not to get caught next time, or raise the maintenance fee on customer deposits.

I'm not really trying to play devil's advocate here, just doesn't make sense. your scenario is about an individual miner, not a pool, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in electricity costs. coupled with other people being disinterested in bitcoin mining and coupled with this one miner having a lot of sha256 ASICS (which would cost way more than hundreds of thousands of dollars to do)

Although it is interesting to see bitcoin grow as a sector, these amounts are really low for a sector.
Healthcare, for instance, has venture capital investment in the billions every single year.
But, yes, we all expect bitcoin technology to engulf and touch every sector. I hope Factom works for health records on the blockchain, for example.

Yes it is. That is how percentages work. 
In 2011 you would have been holding more bitcoin , and would have experienced a 90% drop in the value of those bitcoin.
In 2014 you would have been holding less bitcoin, and would have experience a proportional drop in the value of those bitcoin.
Venture capital investment has frequently outpaced relevance in the tech industry. Many companies that went bust in the tech bubble were actually good ideas and are profitable ventures today - by different companies with different investors.
with Bitcoin, the ability to transfer cryptographic inputs with metadata between addresses didn't change then, and doesn't change now

bitcoin wasn't profitable enough (market size too small) before then to start any businesses to address this issue.
Everything is moving in the direction necessary. It wasn't practical to invest 14 million in ASICs when bitcoin's market cap was 8 million. It wasn't practical to invest in a 25 million New York money transmission license when bitcoin's market cap was 30 million.

The point is that if you had $10000 in bitcoin in 2011  or if you had $10000 in bitcoin at 2014
the price at which you acquired bitcoin is not relevant
if you experienced a 90% loss in either of those years it didn't matter if the exchange rate was $30 or $900, do you have a rebuttal to that? In each situation your $10000 would still have retreated to $1000, and you would have the same loss

I agree, even the FBI and over a dozen law enforcement agencies in over a dozen countries failed to seize barely any bitcoin ($1 million, maybe 3000 btc) in Operation Onymous in part due to the adaptation of multisig in the darknet markets.
Where just one year prior, the FBI and Reykjavik Metropolitan Police were able to get over 100,000 BTC in the silk road bust.
Clearnet is really behind. I feel like it is possible for bitcoin deposits even on fiat exchanges to be secured in at least a 2 of 3 address. Traders can use the database entries to day trade without moving any actual bitcoin, just like now. But when it comes time to withdraw either the site makes two signatures if the user has less bitcoin, or the site + the user make a signature to withdraw. Or some other combination. A hacker couldn't just swipe the hot wallet. The site would need to keep it's second keys on a different server, but the hacker would at least need both keys for every deposit address.

But I considered them as obligatory as the janitor, or the sound crew, or the intern manning the booth because the company didn't have a sales team. I never considered the gender aspect of it, or its possible effects on the female attendees, which aren't exactly a unicorn, from my experience. But maybe I've only been to conferences where everyone has been trying to make "women in tech" a thing, for the last ten years, so I get a skewed perspective.

@_date: 2015-01-14 14:02:12
This happens aalllllll the time in the securities market
I do it in altcoins, because it only takes like 3 bitcoins to move the market :3  basically, you accumulate over time (with more than 3 bitcoins, lol), it doesn't matter at what price especially if you know what the dev team is working on (or if you might add utility to the codebase yourself). Then you wait for liquidity to drop, wait for the bids and asks to be fucking HUGE, like strait of gibralter huge. And then you just sell, below the bids, this will only be a fraction of your total position, less than 5%, maybe even up to 20%. 
So some altcoin is like 11000 satoshis, and you know that everyone is thinking that 10,000 satoshis is the support and that it won't go lower. And you are like, okay, SELL, now it is at 6700 satoshis, and you are in trollbox, you are in IRC just watching the instantaneous reaction. 
"Hey guys is it a good time to get X-coin"
"WHAT HAPPENED, does anybody have any news"
"X-coin dead"
"pump is over, I saw it on twitter"
The technical analysis guys - these are the funniest ones - they make predictions about MY BEHAVIOR, about MY MOTIVATIONS. They have no idea what I'm doing. These guys masquerade as an authority in the subject too. I don't say anything, just lurk.
"MACD just crossed 200-day support level" what the fuck are you talking about dude, it is literally just me fucking your coin's tape up. 
I have now placed a pretty decent bid limit order on the bid. And now everyone else selling is selling to me. I will also outbid other buyers, up to a point.
This is how it works when you have a larger position than the average liquidity supports.

darkwallet obelisks can still see a lot of information about each transaction!
But lets say John set up his own obelisk in TOR, then he can keep the data to himself, but the next problem:
also, nobody knows the liquidity at any given time in darkwallet. If there is nobody to mix with, then darkwallet will not mix your coins at all! so if the stealth address recipient address ever spent the funds it will link back to the origin without stealth!
So a general user has two areas where they have to trust darkwallet! Dead in the water.
=== next solutions:
The altcoin darkcoin's darksend network has a similar issue with masternodes. They see too much information.
Monero, using the parameter of mixin 3 or greater, works better for this partially because the entire network is using stealth addresses.

There are a couple issues.
Short answer: if they use bitcoin there would be a noticeable effect on price.
Long answer: Trusted institutions could use blockchain technology without units, or with units, and those institutions would at least be able to make sure nobody was trying to cheat them.
But they could also use a centralized database, like they already do. And that is much more efficient for this purpose, but not trustless, and not easily upgradable. And involves all of the overhead of running a bank and various government agencies and it's courts, to use.
So they could settle obligations in bitcoin instead and save costs and gain more commerce and hours of operation, efficiency, and be able to move bitcoin via currency swaps or straight onto an exchange themselves, as liquidity improves.
There is also the greater possibility, in this scenario, that bitcoin denominated hedging products will be used in more frequency, again adding liquidity as well as closing the bitcoin economy loop (since liquidation into fiat currency wouldn't be necessary), and when the inflows outpace the outflows, the bitcoin price will continue an upward trajectory.
Hope that helped

so I think you still don't realize how inconsequential those 20 blocks would be. 
this effects nobody's holdings, the double spend could effect a merchant/consumer/exchange transaction, and would be immediately known by the network
yes, somebody could be effected once.
20 minutes to an hour of network debilitation
this is where other miners turn their systems back on, OR the network forks into a different algorithm.
If miners turn their systems back on, the network becomes usuable again
If miners stay disinterested, then a software update can fork the network and the datacenter SHA256 ASIC farm is rendered obsolete, and the network becomes usuable again

segwit and the blocksize debate are both pretty boring. most bitcoin competitors have functionally larger or adaptable block sizes, and all of them can implement segwit or lightning if their communities want. I am willing to pay a larger than average bitcoin transaction fee to get to those networks, and exchanges are accommodating by providing direct USD and fiat markets skipping bitcoin entirely.
I can still foresee several avenues of constricted supply of bitcoin in the face of huge demand. its all pretty exciting for the ecosystem, but its the maximalists that should be worried.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:34:17
so I see that on the charts too, I opted to say something else for brevity. I also do not find that consequential.
Instead, the point about how long it took for bitcoin to return to its previous high in the 30s and surpass that to $260, that is consequential, and that was 22 months, nearly two years
Making threads like this one "lets talk about the price" completely moot, the utility of bitcoin remains the same or improves, it doesn't get less useful, so therefore the price does not, and cannot destroy bitcoin, as the inputs and their exchange rate are independent
That is the only worthwhile point talking about here

Alright, so in one scenario people or families would already have bitcoin addresses, which they have registered with their name in a central database much like a phonebook. 
People abroad can donate directly to these addresses. Instead of a text from Red Cross that takes you to their credit card page or mobile payment mechanism, it would instead just give you a random address from the register of people in that area.
On the ground individual people wouldn't know they control more bitcoin, unless they could get an update on their funds. This is where red cross (or other aid group) can come in with their satellite connection in a central place for people to get this information. No different than how people will try to get information on their loved ones from a central place. If there is a balance, and exchange rate, then individual transaction(s) can be signed offline, or the entire address (and private key) traded for another good or service or local currency.
Looters and gangs can appropriate property from others by force no matter what the digital security measures are. No need to hold this asset to a higher standard than other assets.
Anyway, I'm sure the delivery methods can be improved and it probably won't be too productive talking about the specifics of this scenario if you are still a cynic, but hopefully it reveals possibilities that are now in reach.

Practically the entire services infrastructure relies on multiple confirmations before providing the good or service. Unfortunate, but reality.
So, given the ever looming possibility of a block taking an hour or two and not getting even the initial confirmation, it can be frustrating if your transaction doesn't get included in the first block.
It is also subsidizing miners who are less beneficial to the network than other miners.

@_date: 2015-01-06 04:12:56


1) Why are you keeping your bitcoins on a website?
2) Why does the first question confuse you?
Basically, since the point of bitcoin is that you don't need anyone in the middle between your control of your bitcoin funds, and spending it, then in theory shouldn't need a site that is acting like your online bank. Get an app called a wallet (of which there are many to choose from) instead, and move your bitcoin to it.

Cool, I was about to start a thread asking people what they've bought with their cryptocurrency profits! All you ever see are threads about people HODLING and never getting anything, with fiat currency.
I think about how my position is down but trading plan is still set, and if I have to second guess myself I just look at the various things I've spent profits on, such as patent related costs - which was also tax deductible and various other milestones.
I did a bit of traveling too with my Nov 2013 profits - on the weekends ;) - got upgraded nicely with the banks too, but don't let anyone know that here, statist alert.
Also maintaining my day job, which is a lucrative career, just keep the cash flow coming in, don't leverage up, and all is still gravy.
Fortunately I've had great trading wins and losses outside of cryptocurrency. And that is very helpful, for instance when you save and save and save, holding out for some fictional number in dollars before you start splurging on frivolous things, you really miss out. When you get one bad trade, you think about how much of the splurging you COULD HAVE been doing with that same amount. Helps you be able to take a little, or a lot, off the top next time :) some people will put you on a pedestal for saving so responsibly, but really, live a little

Nobody is suggesting that a bitcoin wallet needs those permissions, but if you provide certain services to users then you need those permissions
here is the code on github  
In the file AndroidManifest.xml you can see that
Push notifications (GCM for Google Cloud Messaging) requires android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS which prompts both the contacts and identity permission requests. As stated earlier, this is part of Google Play Services.
and in the libs folder you can see that
The HockeyApp library requires location access, and this is used for crash reports and information for A/B testing, which it seems like was removed in a previous commit.
I understand this stuff is esoteric, and this is about the idea of having a bitcoin wallet ask those permissions. Fact is, if it was going to steal your private keys, it would just broadcast that to the server in a network call, and it would have nothing to do with a concoction of hard to explain permission sets!

Another strategy is to place trades at key support levels when they get broken, which reveals a trend, and you can help that trend. Support, once broken, becomes resistance.
It is the same for longs, when a resistance level is broken you could be in for a great rally. Everything before that is just the doldrums.

Dark Wallet's anonymity is a misconception, the obelisks know all about your transaction so you have to trust them (or run your own), also if there is nobody to mix with then dark wallet will just send your stealthed transaction through to the recipient without mixing, also the first non stealthed transaction from the recipient will reveal the entire link back to you
and you never know the liquidity of the dark wallet system to prevent this from happening.
there is a lot of chance involved

Although the 1% fee with Coinbase is very expensive. No broker does that. And this has absolutely nothing to do with credit card comparisons. In the financial industry broker's max commission is $99. But in reality it is a race to the bottom with $0 - $7 commissions.
The market needs to let Coinbase know that this isn't tolerated. They only implemented that business model because of the continual "cheaper than credit cards" rhetoric.

As I don't keep any funds on exchanges, I wasn't able to pick up more than $1,500 in bitcoin in the drop. But its better than a year ago.

Even if Coinsetter challenged a disclosure order, they could be under gag order to never tell you.
The consequence is cancelled out. You will never know what information about you was siphoned off whether they had the clause or not.
Apple isn't a financial institution. Coinsetter is. Basically every regulation under the Patriot Act and subsequent acts and previous banking acts applies to them, and similarly, the licenses they require are voluntary relinquishments of otherwise constitutional protections that you would even CONSIDER challenging. All them bases are comprised, this is a pointless exercise.

Because it says so.
FDIC insurance covers individual customer's accounts, not how many accounts Coinbase has. And it will also one account for a corporate entity.
The FDIC also has special plans for entities with lots more money, and to understand this you have to understand how the banking system works. As you know about fractional banking, they have at LEAST 10:1 leverage on every deposit you make. So for accounts over a million dollars, this is a very substantial portion of their liquidity, as a $2 million account is $20 million in trading funds for the banks. 
So, the TARP program was also put in place that promotes large deposits to restore faith in the financial system

Man, I just know a lot of models that are very excited and enthusiastic to land promotional modeling gigs, many of which may have an interest in the company or the field the company is in, like broadly tech or electronics.
They are aware of the assumptions people make about them, how other women may scoff at them for unfounded reasons.
Its just very strange and sexist to me to treat the whole gender as a monolithic entity - in 2015 I understand that is meta, but that doesn't make it false - and broadly saying it is unclassy for the one set of them to be there. I've seen the scantily clad booth babe with glitter pasties not representing anyone in particular and no reason to be there, but the whole concept of a promotional model will keep a keynote speaker away? And that's classy, because classy? what?
So I like OP's other explanation about whether it is adding or subtracting value from a potential target audience. There just seems to be assumptions, preconceptions about what a booth babe is, 100% of the time, versus reality.

Queue fake controversy.
So, software libraries used for A/B testing (Google Analytics, Hockey App, Crashalytics, UrbanAirship etc) all require location access for those libraries to function
These apps are used to help developers improve the software.
Photos/Media/Files permissions are used to write data and read data to your external storage. You want to load a QR code from file instead of a new picture? Then you need that permission.
You want to use the Camera and have it do an I/O operation so that it doesn't take up all your memory? then the app needs to be able to write to Photos/Media/Files
Many software libraries, including the ones I previously mentioned, need access to your "contacts" and "identity" in order to do mundane tasks like use Google Play Services.
But who knows how blockchain.info is using it, these are just really common permission requirements.

Or because in pre-trail, the Judge said that 4th amendment protections against search and seizure don't apply unless he proved that he owned the site, requiring him to violate his 5th amendment protections against self incrimination.
Since his lawyer's procedural arguments - regarding the FBI's state sponsored hacking, search and seizure of random foreign computers in a foreign country for a website serving 200 additional non-US countries and the lies about how they were found - were rejected unless an "American testified to being the owner", then it was worthwhile to say he was the owner.

another side effect is that they gave a massssssiiiiveeee tax loophole for cryptocurrency-cryptocurrency trading.
If you just doubled your bitcoin trading paycoins or some shit, you don't have to pay any tax on that trade, UNTIL you cash out to USD, due to the like-kind treatment that property gets.
So instead of counting HOW MANY bitcoins you bought, and at what price, it simply counts how much USD you swapped into bitcoin, and how much USD you get out.
It is actually kind of epic
But the bitcoin inputs themselves shouldn't be taxed, the whole "asset class" discussion is a red herring and a false dilemma
The bitcoin network is a service, acting as a financial service, that only has market value by coincidence. Some countries recognize this (finland) and others have come to the same conclusive through a different route (UK), ultimately ending with tax exemption.

Offline transaction infrastructure wasn't available in 2013, or 2014, and won't be in 2015 either
It is easy to see how the protocol would work even without the presence of ubiquitous internet infrastructure. A super slow satellite connection can broadcast megabytes of transactions once a day or week. This really isn't far fetched and also has nothing to do with using bitcoin via mobile apps or QR codes, assuming that is how you are imagining it. It is about getting transactional power in the hands of the people instead of a different organization.
I don't have to visit [name-the-island] after [name-the-disaster] to see the utility of being able to donate directly to people, every time I receive a mass text message from Red Cross. Bitcoin can facilitate that. The actual disaster haiyan/fukushima/port-au-prince/katrina is a red herring to the discussion. With this protocol it can be easy for people to have funded addresses assigned to them and exchange paper wallets or other tokens offline, redeemable for goods, services and local currency as infrastructure improves.

Bitcoin transactions can be signed offline, but they will need to be broadcast to the network later. Just like a merchant that accepts credit cards with no internet connection. Payments could be settled in bulk at the end of the day, or other interval really.
So in a situation with severely altered internet, there could be local hubs, like today's internet cafes, or check cashing places, or western union style remittance places, which did have connection to a larger network. People would go there and either sync up to get their own balances, or these places would broadcast transactions.
Regarding offline bitcoin use though, the offline address won't be able to do many transactions because the later transactions relies on the presence of inputs in a particular order (but you can control as many funded addresses as you want). As bitcoin is merely a series of input signatures tied to an address, and the market finds utility in the ability to move these signatures to another address. So, a later transaction is assuming that the inputs are still in a particular order and available for use in a transaction, but a previous offline transaction which was signed prior, will move those inputs in the blockchain, making the later transactions not possible, unless they were resigned offline with the updated inputs.
So with diligent address management, one could use bitcoin offline for a long time period. And of course, someone completely offline can have anyone SEND bitcoin to their valid addresses. And you could make an infinite number of bitcoin addresses offline, and always get paid to different ones. This ensures your ability to continue having unspent inputs to sign transactions with.

so I read the article and I don't get it:
Why is this a gradual process, is it technically challenging for them to do this across their products or are they weaning their clients over to it, and yes, I am assuming these are mutually exclusive problems.
The article makes it seem like a technical challenge, which is not true. "Wheeew!! after 8 months of toil and trouble we have..... added additional decimal places!" as if they had to create an entire software development environment and modify assembly instructions so that mobile ARM processors would interpret it correctly. But no, it is just a cosmetic change
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:09:39
so P2SH address is a script, I'm not sure about the limitations of this script though, but it stands to reason that the script could send those instructions
Maybe instead of time after transaction, we could do X blocks after last spent output, which would accomplish the same thing and also make sure that transactions aren't confused for received transactions
The next problem is that this only accounts for one address, if you are using HD address generation then you won't be reusing addresses this way. So somehow the same signers need to be available for the entire sequence, every time an address is generated. (Although many addresses can be made in advance)

No no, they couldn't attack again and again because they wouldn't have a monopoly on hardware necessary for it.
If a miner spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on NOT ONLY ELECTRICITY but hardware, then currently they would have SHA256 ASICS.
The hardfork will change the hashing algorithm to Scrypt, for example. All of the miner's hardware is useless. The miner has to go and get hardware again.
If they attack again, the hashing algorithm will change to X11, or X13, or a concoction like Myriad.
In all of these scenarios it lets other people earn A LOT OF BITCOINS if they have a computational advantage. This is a lucrative profit incentive.

It is probably related to a supply shock. Same demand on exchange and lower supply on exchange means higher price.
Bitcoin network congestion also means not much is going to move back to the exchange very quickly, so the shocks sustain for a limited time. The fun starts when the shocks result in higher demand.

\&gt; Every week there is tons of news about how the bitcoin supply is being soaked up by VC's, investment funds, new customers and services, and countless other bullish news. Yet the price keeps going down/sideways. I sense manipulation through and through - &amp;
well if we've only identified 6% of the buying pressure for the new supply over 3 months, then how is it unfathomable to think there is more supply than demand.
there is new supply along with people that don't want to hold anymore, and here we are with a news article about someone soaking up merely 6% equivalent of whats coming onto the market. If I was a VC this remains reassurance that I can put a lower price quite a distance below market price and wait for miners and weaker hands to sell to me.

I understand exactly what it is and don't find it controversial.
Yes, it undermines the idea that labor or capital is required to obtain resources, and it has the ability to destroy confidence in its currency.
Yes, it is chartered by US Congress exclusively, and its shareholders are all private banks.
Yes, that 6% dividend for the past 100 years is a ridiculously good deal.
Yes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is the only part of it accountable to the US government, for now. It has no say over what the shareholders of the Federal Reserve entity actually do with the Federal Reserve.
There are valid criticisms of it, it is equally as valid to understand it and bask in that power. The people that wanted state backed confidence in their misunderstood markets were no different than us. These guys were playing this game long before Benjamin Graham wrote "The Intelligent Investor", before Warren Buffett was even born, and you need to be just as ahead of the game too.

Hello there, much better arguments than the article I read on Coindesk about your case.


What definition of commodity is that? What legal standard is that? I like the argument and distinction between contract related financial assets but I need a source for it, I don't think its real but prove me wrong.
Even then don't you think this is a red herring? It has enough properties to be a completely new asset class, so the dichotomy you have to choose between is interesting.
But please elaborate:
Currency related financial products can be regulated under NYDFS' current mandate?
Commodity related financial products cannot be regulated under NYDFS' current mandate?
Currency related financial products can be regulated under NYDFS' current mandate by New York law but you think the Federal Dodd Frank law removed that authority from the state?
edit: I read all the arguments now. Why not go straight to Federal Court with this, which is literally next door? The arguments are good and comprehensive but the state's judge would be more apprehensive to saying any actor of the state is wrong.

the "coin" in bitcoin and "currency" in cryptocurrency are misnomers, skeumorphs to make the concept of the new asset class relatable.
the value transfer aspect works, it is an self sufficient network, and this has a value associated with it. do you need to use the value transfer aspect as a coin or currency? no, you don't. The talk of the it being a global currency or settlement network is largely homage to the misnomers originally presented, but it is a fun thought exercise because it is also possible. The financial aspect is a tool for speculation, and again the 'coin' and 'currency' monikers confuse unsuspecting people that are trying to see how it could be used, just like you. This is an asset just like the Apple Inc Bonds that mature in the year 2025 are an asset. You wouldn't spend two seconds considering the Apple Inc 2025 Bonds as the reserve currency of the world, but you might still put it in your portfolio.

okay so this is based on 4% of Bitcoin's transactions being used by mixers and tumbling services, but if those mixers are doing ... 4 ... 5, or 6 transactions for each user then really only less than 1% of bitcoin transactions are distinct, and the rest just bloating the blockchain due to an inferior technology being used. 
this would mean the "over double" of Monero - as cited in the article - would be inaccurate when judging privacy interest, while remaining accurate when only looking at transaction numbers.
Confidential transactions would be a superior technology to coinjoin and tumbling, which some core devs have mentioned being on the roadmap. Lightning transactions can also be privacy focused and more numerous, and wouldn't be easy to count.
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:40:24


would this really help? They were probably using bitpay to automatically cash out.
Just getting a server that presents a nice gui that has a countdown, monitors unconfirmed transactions and doesn't re-use addresses has nothing to do with automatically turning that to fiat.

Why are adaptive block sizes impossible on the bitcoin network?
Monero has several bitcoin core devs working on it, and they are also bringing similar non-consensus changing code to bitcoin. It is useful for me in some circumstances, but just being aware of what another network is doing doesn't mean "fell for it"
Most consensus changes on bitcoin were tried on the mainnets of other valuable networks first, and that helped sway consensus for an upgrade to bitcoin

I too had looked at the laws supporting NYDFS's authority, and some other companies did as well which is why Theo is standing alone here.
The movement to consolidate those agencies in 2011 seemed to have passed the due process clause, as it says that the agency has been delegated power over financial matters. It doesn't rely on words like "money" or "these asset classes in particular", it says financial regulation.
At best, he can challenge some parts of the bitlicense that create financial regulatory duties for custodians.
His arbitrary and capricious argument will fail because of the comment period, unless he attacks the comment period procedure. The government actor pointed out the interest it had in creating this regulation, which will remove the liability of that constitutional challenge.
Maybe he can tell the federal government that it adversely affects interstate commerce, lol. But this is basically the only things states do these days, adversely affect interstate commerce, so that will be a difficult constitutional challenge for a judge to agree to, given the ramifications of undermining so many semi-sovereign entities.
It would be nice if he can get a permanent stay on the bitlicense though. His arguments though, are lacking.

volume and price may have a correlation but they are mutually exclusive.
there is no relation and so therefore there doesn't have to be a correlation.
that's all you are missing.
there are less amounts of bitcoin being traded right now, the people that are trading are still agreeing on a certain price, in less quantities than before. \*shrug\*

Withdraw USDC using Coinbase. They just use ACH transfers and don't create these user experience problems from incompetence.
If the amounts are big enough use an OTC desk like Cumberland instead. There is absolutely no reason to use any consumer-facing crypto-service if you can manage it, most OTC desks have a minimum trade size of $100,000. But if you already have a relationship with them they'll process much lower amounts.

This doesn't require parameters from the physical world, just on chain data. 
Adaptive block sizes typically look at the past X blocks to determine what size a future block can be.
Monero looks at the past 100 blocks.
Responsible consensus changes in Bitcoin have also been triggered by prior block information, typically flags included in metadata of blocks by miners, to determine if it is safe to execute different code.
It is not impossible for Bitcoin to have adaptive block sizes based on what you said.

It is. There is surplus energy and it is all being wasted and has no way of being transported economically. Bitcoin mining is the economic savior.
Your other point about it being NICE if Bitcoin mining used less energy anyway? Sure! Bitcoin mining is already an optimization for the environment. 8 of that 10GW was already being wasted typically by letting it fizzle out into the atmosphere.
You're just counting numbers and getting mad and not factoring in what was already happening before mining arrived.

Using Monero as a real world case study, adaptive block sizes did not prevent a fee market from developing, as the adaptations took too long to grow during the shorter lived period of high demand.
I don't think tail emission is necessary here. There could still be a range or maximum cap. Block sizes adjust back down during periods of less demand.

Although BTC and every other coin with Segwit would be faster, the core argument for "bcash" is that they don't want LN.
They know how LN works and why it works well, their fear of lightning is that the channel operators can implement criteria such as onerous AML/KYC and that there will be no other payment channels to use, and trying to transact on the main chain would have a high barrier.

No it’s not enough to dictate the price
If there is demand for bitcoin people have to buy it
If no body is selling physical bitcoin then the people that want to buy bitcoin have to buy at a higher price
There is either no demand in which case get out of this experiment
Institutional traders are selling large amounts of bitcoin more than the current demand alongside their futures position. A miner needing to lock in a price can mine new bitcoin and hedge by selling short physical or cash settled bitcoin futures, this is the actual purpose of futures across all markets and is not controversial
If the price actually goes down its because miner’s new bitcoin is still more than the actual demand for bitcoin at all.

I think these were valid critiques before the chain snapshot occurred and continues to have hash rate, but thats already happened.
They want on-chain scaling exclusively, and they have it. They removed RBF so that network can handle instant unconfirmed transactions, with confidence, so they don't need something even faster?
An enterprising miner can make a windfall in transactions by trying to propagate a block that has more of the transaction backlog than other blocks.
They have those things, thats going to keep happening at this point, so I'm not really sure why its important to have rebuttals to that.
Did I understand it correctly? Some bcash proponents may say those things which aren't absolutes, just like you say some things that aren't absolutes.
We agree that bitcoin will be able to handle quick coffee transactions with lightning. Bcash does via removal of RBF and the ability to clear its unconfirmed transactions onchain. Bcash in theory will hit a scaling problem/limit as its blockchain grows too large, they forked, let them do it, there are other offchain scaling proposals that may work on that kind of network. People that want onchain history have that now, so its not really a theory to debate over, and offchain scaling wont be promulgated by the people that work on the underlying protocol itself.

The fear is about tomorrow when there are enough lighting network transactions to also congest the main chain, and the lighting network operators also create tools and KYC requirements.

Is bitcoin really full of a class of people that never had anything they had to voluntarily report? Everyone here only had their employers automatically withholding their payments and thought they were "getting away with something" because they had bitcoin?
I'm not so sure, I looked at how the IRS contractor came up with the "only 800 people reported" number and I don't think I would have been included.
I had LTC on one year's tax filing and a gain reported. I had BTC on one year's. These are years I went to cash and I never touched fiat in between time. None of these filings ever mentioned Coinbase, and I usually didn't use Coinbase.

Europol's investigative arm has a presentation out that shows they cannot surveil Monero, while bitcoin is trivial to surveil. They looked at other non-surveillance payment networks and found Dash and Zcash trivial to surveil as well, as non of their mobile wallets include the privacy features. Only the "core" client on desktop does.
So according to governments, Monero actually works for being fungible.

Bitcoin rallies 8 days out of any given year.
Those rallies are parabolic.
Historical data suggests a 100k print is possible in 5 independent 8 day time periods.

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:29:19


Yes, but it would be more wise to hold that in bitcoin because of the delta of 1. ie. if bitcoin moves 30% the wrong way before your futures contract expiration and you collateralized with cash, then you have a margin call.
Although would be helpful for the CME and brokerages to add the bitcoin deposit option, the traders themselves have portfolios balanced across various markets, and cross-asset portfolio weightings are a big industry. Therefore someone short SHOULD own a responsible amount of bitcoin to hedge their position.
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:31:08
A) You don't need to be an "OG" - meaning in the crypto space for a long time and sitting on mass appreciation - the only criteria is just ever moving dollars amounts of that size through the bitcoin network. Rich people exist, the end.
B) Bitcoin markets are liquid enough for these amounts, as A) happens all the time every day for years
C) No matter how you get to Bitcoin the goal would be to have your assets in bitcoin as it is the most liquid cryptocurrency. Then sell them OTC. Fuck the exchanges. OTC desks are way faster and a very different user experience as there is no deposit transaction. OTC doesn't show your order to the lit market, it is privately negotiated very quickly at professional 24/7 trade desks - 10 seconds is a good benchmark - and then you can send your bitcoin from your private wallet to the trade desk's designated address and they will send you the wire. You can be in bitcoin and into your example $40 million of fiat in your normal bank account within 2 hours. Almost the same as a bitcoin 6 confirmation time.
You should really only be using exchanges when you are trading amounts that are less than an OTC desk minimum. Which is when you are trading in amounts between $1 and $100,000 .

One thing I think is missing for multisig are case studies for specific combinations and criticisms of those specific combinations. for about 6 years now it seems like there is only conjecture about what you can do, not what you should for specific situations
The wallets absolutely neglecting this feature and the UX around it certainly doesn't help. The CoPay mobile app was cool, but wait it doesn't do segwit versions of multisig and will it ever?  Maybe this Casa app will fill that void!
Regarding the type of multisig:
2 of 3? Is it three people holding keys hoping 2 don't conspire or is it one person holding 2 keys with one of the keys being on a second factor device, and who is the third, a custodian, lawyer, family member?

There is KYC but the difference is that
They wont ask you questions on the trade or impair your ability to have funds available
They wont freeze your account with funds in your account with them because you never deposit with them to begin with
You simply move light years faster than other traders because there is less bullshit and less time used
You are using wire transfers instead of the ACH system. So money movements that will take some people up to 7 actual days even if its just 2-3 business days can be accomplished intraday for you.
You can also negotiate assets. If you have a random shitcoin you can just ask the OTC to make a market for you in USD and negotiate a trade price. 
Other traders are 1. Depositing shitcoin to binance waiting for confirmations 2. Selling for bitcoin waiting for the right bids to appear 3. Withdrawing to Coinbase waiting for slow bitcoin confirmation 4. Selling on coinbase and waiting 2-7 days for money in their bank account
You 1. Send shitcoin from your private wallet to OTC desk 2. Money in your bank account in 2 hours
I’ve gone straight from a shitcoin to a wire into my stock brokerage account. Traded an options contract and wired the funds right back into crypto all in one morning.
And then come on reddit and watch everyone pretend that anyone owning more than $5,000 in bitcoin is taking a huge risk and needs a lecture . Its hilarious.

guarantees doesn't mean there is no risk. did you literally just gloss over the part that you quoted verbatim? "most guarantees"? like a quantitative measurement of more than one because clearly one guarantee is not enough to make investors like your investment over another?
Anyway, Fitch and Moody's rates US debt at its highest rating AAA, S&amp;P rates it as the second to highest rating.
I don't think you disproved what you thought you did.
The fifth amendment allows the US to expropriate private property in exchange for compensation. They'll just create a new IOU. And before they even get there, there are plenty of tax scenarios it can create, income tax scaled to 90% in the 1960s, and before the revolutionary creation of income tax in 1913, it taxed property for a hundred years.
The IRS expects to collect 1.4 trillion annually from US Citizens, this could easily be doubled and tripled to stuff federal coffers, from a pure "is there money available to pay back" perspective, not from a political perspective. Austerity can be implemented very easily, it doesn't matter what party or even the political system in place.

oh no not solid value! waaaaaah! its all going to "end" in the most ambiguous and abstract way possible! Who could have seen this unknown and nondescript outcome coming!
The debt is just marketable securities it has issued. So they issue 1 billion in a new bond, investor (can include nation state) gives them 1 billion, and the US pay pennies in interest annually. And eventually will give the investor the 1 billion back.
More practically though, the US issues new bonds at even lower interest rates after paying off a portion of the last bond. It is the equivalent of a balance transfer in credit cards, or refinancing. And then they pay even less pennies.
Where do those miniscule amounts in interest payments come from? They can just skim off the top of the 1 billion that was given to them, with the frequency they issue new bonds. But it can also come from tax collection, as its tax base does keep expanding.
For the US, the debt to GDP ratio would have to get nearly 10 to 1 before it fails to make just the INTEREST payments. (Although its credit rating will have cratered long before then, under the proper recognition that any economic slowdown would adversely affect its ability to keep up with bond servicing) We are barely at 1 to 1.
But hey, stranger things have happened!
Its just the current outcome alone shouldn't sound alarm bells solely because of the great numerical value. A deeper argument would be necessary.
The US Federal Government doesn't currently finance itself with a property tax (it replaced that with income tax 100 years ago). But the whole world knows that it can, and the whole world knows that there is 17 trillion of privately owned property in the US, the whole world knows that it can also expropriate property too. This isn't a political debate, this has nothing to do with Congress or what is political popular right now. 
S&amp;P, China, Saudi Arabia, and all the investment banks know that the US Federal Government has multiple multiple ways of making good on its debt.

Kraken US easily confused at Tier 3 verification
Kraken Euro easily confused at Tier 3 verification
No kraken account was obtained for this well connected person, who was not interested enough to clear up why they weren't an international terrorist. Kraken lost the business of their primary desired clientele.
Circle worked seamlessly despite not even advertising bitcoin services anymore, and allowed an instant $3,000 bitcoin acquisition and withdrawal with no fees (except poor exchange rate, thats their 1%)
By far the best way to acquire bitcoin in the US if you are not poor is with Barry Silbert's Genesis Trading, in which case you are still paying a wire fee anyway.

Another thing to add:
If any Private Equity deal was publicly traded, you would see the same price movements between rounds of funding or lack thereof.
Any series A company would have its share price rise and fall +/- 90% on any news.
But the series A share prices are already 1,000% above the seed round prices.
And the IPO several financing rounds later would have similar ROI from the seed round as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have had.
The reality is that Private Equity deals are not publicly traded, and you only get access to +/- 10% ROI if that, after it hits the stock market.
The analogy is limited because bitcoin is not a company, the only thing **unique** here is poor people's exposure to a high growth asset.

Maybe the landing site can be a static web page, and the cart link goes to the wordpress+cart plugin. Limiting the load on the wordpress site and whenever/however it goes to potentially slower features like databases.

They need to encourage relief from source of money sanctions, for banks to be more comfortable.
Similarly governing bodies should consider not using other people's money on whitelisting transactions, since even the best AML/KYC is ineffective here.
It is a broken institution otherwise, and makes the banks skittish from arbitrary enforcement.
Governing bodies will simply need to use different tools to prevent whichever actions they really didn't want to happen.

Out here in San Francisco there's been a lot of research (both public and private sector) into the distinctions of personalities and circumstances populating the streets. One thing that stood out to me was the visible homeless being such a small percent of the potentially addressable problem.


Going back to 'potentially addressable problem', that was one of the realizations of ill-considered but well-meaning efforts. Many people did not want housing.


Not all. Which ones checked your credit out of curiosity.


This is something for many to avoid, but if you have a desirable skill set it is less important. This made me wonder a little more about your circumstance: 
What are you good at? Where do you live? There are plenty of economic deadzones and you have a car so you need to go to a place with more opportunities. 
What is keeping you where you are? There are plenty of good reasons, I'm just curious. If the monotony of daily basic survival takes up all your time, then consider stocking up and hitting the road, or even selling the car and taking a bus/train somewhere.
Do you also have a criminal record? This is a contributing factor to marginalizing people outside of the workforce in many places.
Also have you considered contracting, 1099 work instead of W-2 work? Less information is needed and you can make more in the short term.

Which architecture decision made it go slow by the way?
It just seems hard to make sites slow these days from spikes in traffic. If this was a static website served from S3 + Cloudfront, or heroku + Cloudfront it would be basically free (less than $7/mo) and not slow down at all.
Is it really the wordpress design choice and probably a server in a low memory VM?
Is it just because its a cookie cutter solution their web host provided?
Slow websites make me question my own design choices, but then I never experience these problems and theoretically shouldn't with auto-scaling. But I always think I'm going to eat my words as soon as I add some database w/o understanding a memory cache correctly or something.

Thats actually a very good metric.
You can starve out other market participants and determine who is there. People that borrowed have to pay interest monthly, and you can tell who borrowed too much by filling buy order 10% away below the prior best bid. You can then wait it out further, expecting a random distribution to have unexpected life events.
Ultimately, the people without capital sell to the people with capital who never sell, and this makes the remaining amount of the asset more scarce.
You having to get out to pay rent accomplishes this as well.

Isn't there a counterpoint available here that people use Tether and they print when the demand outpaces the supply? In order to keep it at a $1.00 exchange rate they have to increase the supply otherwise it will go above $1.00.
People can buy USD Tethers for actual USD. This allows them to hold stable value off of the exchange if they want, and move stable value to other exchanges without worrying about volatility. I know of OTC trade desks that also take USDT and this is faster than a wire transfer and it that solves the liquidity issue that may seem apparent on the USDT pairs on exchanges.

Development took too long and this does light a fire under them.
It forces bitcoin to be more nimble. The development teams in bitcoin have rejected the "move fast and break things" philosophy for a very long time. They collectively thought "too much money is at stake" when it was a merely 100 million dollar network. But this hasn't been a successful antithesis, its just been "move slow and WAIT WE STILL BROKE SOMETHING"
If you are afraid of a breaking change making people loose confidence in bitcoin, well its 2018 and you can buy put options.
This is a way for bitcoin to be competitive. Lightning payment channels will run in different directions on other cryptocurrencies as well, and anything that works good will be merged in, or that network will lose its competitive advantage.

It doesn't matter
see the thing is, when you short you have to buy to close your position, when you buy with your massive profits this moves the market back upwards, lowering the percent of your profit, the way to counteract this is if there are more people selling to you at that point in time, providing you the liquidity.
the BEST way to do this is to FUD your way through a big support level. The kind all the technical analysis traders believe in. Because thats where their stop losses are.
If you can get an exchange to merely PRINT something 1 cent under the support level, then everyone's stops get auto triggered, providing your the selling pressure you need to buy back without moving the market up.

Using bitcoin offline still requires stability and consensus for people to agree upon that mode of acceptance.
It wouldn't be useful if that isn't already in place.
If it was in place then you could use it as an intermediary form of exchange, as long as you understand that you, nor the recipient, can broadcast transactions. This signing a transaction can happen with or without a computer. For hyperbole, an abacus could technically sign a transaction. But a more sophisticated offline computer, even a cell phone without internet, could very quickly do it too.
You can both sign transactions, and can both physically transfer transactions.
A banking area, or internet cafe, or area that is able to send messages which can reach other computers with copies of a blockchain periodically can be used to send the transaction to the blockchain, ultimately settling it. You could also go there and check the balances of your offline generated address. Or you could have the latest copy of the blockchain delivered to you on a periodic basis if you so desired, then your own device could check your updated balance.
This is bitcoin with several disrupted infrastructure. The concepts of the internet and the blockchain don't go away. You build new computers and connect them over distances.
In your war torn 2017, these will not be priorities.
In your war torn future, this is not an impossibility.

This is a mistake for several reasons:
1. registering as a broker-dealer will not inherently allow you to trade existing ICOs that registered as securities.
2. the only thing you could legally trade as a registered broker-dealer would be ICOs that registered as securities AND registered again for broad public trading. This doesn't currently exist.
3. By the time it exists, decentralized exchanges will be much more robust. Both bitcoin and ethereum have in progress methods for allowing "off-chain" scaling which is settled automatically back to the blockchain, these could theoretically be faster than centralized exchanges, and have no way of distinguishing between properly regulated tokens or any other token. Issuers wants low to zero compliance costs, holders just want liquidity.

Not entirely true, but a steep drop in hash rate can debilitate the network until the next difficulty adjustment.
If the hashrate is 100 million, it needs that for a block to be found every 10 minutes on average.
If China drops out then the hashrate maybe drops to 50 million. It will take 20 minutes to find a block on average, 4 hours being the high end of that average, for up to 2016 blocks - up to 4 weeks now - before adjusting back to 10 minutes.
If a steeper drop in hashrate occurs, like 75% then it will take 3x as long to find a block. Debilitating the network even longer.
There is no incentive to mine during this time period, as difficulty will be stuck higher, and everyone that isn't already mining will still find very little and have high energy costs. It is unlikely that people will find enough computational power to make the network run faster before the next difficulty adjustment.
AFTERWARDS, the difficulty will adjust downwards, making it profitable for a lot of people to mine again.

The crux of your arguments are that you aren't supposed to have an exchange account because you are under 18
That alone doesn't make it illegal for you to own cryptocurrency, if there was any prohibition at all. Some institutions actively prevent you from opening an account merely because they can't get into a binding agreement with you because you are underage. That fact has zero liability for you and only advantages. It has no liability for explaining how you got the cryptocurrency.
At the amounts you are talking about, 100 Euros, the problems are even less.

@_date: 2017-09-06 02:51:23
Your entire supposition is based on holding bitcoin to a standard higher than M1 currencies.
Cryptocurrencies have the same tenets of M1, M2 and M3, MB that national currencies have, if you must be forced to continue the analogy.
M1 is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the money supply in those, so why do you think your observations that 90% of bitcoin holders use it as M2 or M3 have anything to do with the viability of bitcoin as an M1. The infinite divisible nature makes up for that, and regarding liquidity bitcoin is liquid how liquid do you want it.
Are you concerned that the M2 and M3 holders aren't liquid? Because thats the very definition of M2 and M3 and I would also disagree with you anyway. Lets continue:
M2 and M3 holders reinvest their bitcoin in the bitcoin economy, they are not liquid enough to buy goods, they are liquid enough to invest in assets priced in bitcoin. New companies, new infrastructure projects.
And the good ole volatility argument. You work in a large wealth management firm and think hedging doesn't and can never apply to bitcoin? I mean, I guess you didn't consider it! A lot of people who are paid to know about these kind of things haven't considered it. The US regulators have just approved cryptocurrency options and futures just a few months ago. I think cryptocurrency options and futures and swaps can function better than they do in other capital markets, and will allow any consumer or investor to have stable value no matter what.
Guess that undermines the "FDIC" insurance argument or whatever several concepts you were conflating. No market insurance covers crashes or "steep price declines". What is your role in Wealth Management again? I digress
If hedgers and producers can't even enter this market yet, this means bitcoin is undervalued. If more types of market participants can hold bitcoin as the infrastructure improves, then this means bitcoin is undervalued.
You have extrapolated infinity and based on limited observations today that discount the adaptability of bitcoin. I mean you didn't even get into the horrible user experience of acquiring and holding bitcoins, but you still came to a conclusion based on information that doesn't even account for what can be.

Yes, but the people that had competitive computers to mine will still have all the hashrate, and now will have an even greater proportion of the network
People with old inefficient mining hardware and high electricity costs won't be able to compete until after the difficulty adjusts again, they just won't find blocks and will be using electricity again
They could join a mining pool and submit some shares of work to get paid by the pool that does find blocks, but its not going to be economic for them given their electricity costs and people who it is profitable for. There is probably some point of TX fees where it becomes economical though.

Typically they don't need to use that much firepower. This was a $1.2billion sell order when initially posted. For that game, they just wait for posted buy order liquidity to evaporate when a bored speculator pulls their order, and then they sell without using much money, causing all the stops to hit and auto-sell to the best buy order, which can be placed at any arbitrary price if the order book is thin or cleared.
Thats why I leaned towards other explanations. A large sell order that NEEDED to happen. Bitfinex NEEDED to move assets without more intermediaries (like OTC desks and settling banks) before some other government froze their accounts.

this is a topic of setting up tax deferral plans to entities
you can have multiple 401ks. salary contribution to a 401k is like $18,000 yearly, but employer compensation is another $38,000. so if your employer is not matching or otherwise contributing $38,000 a year, then you can do it through a solo 401k.
IRA still pailing in comparison. If this is all about eeking out another $6k on top of those above numbers, then be my guest. I think the SEP IRAs can do defer a lot though. But the borrowing capability of 401k alone is still better IMO, unless you need discipline.

\&gt; It usually drives the price up as they need to sell it for more in order to get the same profit.
That really doesn't explain why the price rises. It explains why they need the price to rise for it to be economically viable, but those wishes don't make it rise.

You don't agree with the criminal justice system but are willing to accept any arbitrary punishment it eeks out because an arbitrary aspect of his character fails to impress you.
That's really where we are diverging here.
Double life sentence with no possibility of parole over a case where a lot of us actually do have doubt, and a lot of us think the jury would have had doubt if relevant evidence was allowed. Our disagreement with the criminal justice system is extremely intertwined with this specific case. The limitations we identified specifically include excluding evidence against the corrupt officials that became unsealed later, include compounding that lack of information to influence the jury and the sentencing guidelines. These issues are not appealable, do not allow defense to make a defense, and undermine the social contract we expect.
I'd be very content if that information was in the first trial and the same outcome occurred.

I've done it for a 401K several years ago, felt it was way more flexible than the IRA product as the annual contribution limits are like 10 times greater, and you can borrow against them if you want.
In that circumstance, the 401K is a trust attached to an entity, so the entity itself is normal and the plan documents are the only thing that matter. Easy peasy.
What do people find attractive about IRAs? just trying to squeeze out another $6k in tax deferral? Got a bunch of money in other IRA products to roll over?

The point is to force people to spend, invest, or otherwise transfer their money in the economy faster than the next person.
Knowing that there is infinite dilution is intended to motivate people.
They feel that putting it directly into bank accounts will cause the dilution too fast. That main street consolidation into consumptive goods will cause price spikes of some consumptive goods too fast. Whereas the investor class, investment banks, will direct the trickle into consumptive goods at the same rate as never having QE, as they distort investment assets more so instead.

Yes, their negative, less-informed opinions play a factor here, but the point of my part B) is that it is happenstance that the SEC is in a position to gatekeep an investment at all. And that happenstance comes down to the core of what an ETF is: not a company or self trading derivative but a fund - which the SEC also regulates via the human operates running them - offered to the general public. Note, from what I heard it took 5+ years for the first gold ETF to exist.

ehhhhh well there is a valid criticism but not this, let me try to break it down
A) The index is not a security. The SEC regulates most types of securities exchanged.
B) The SEC is gatekeeping the ETFs only because ETFs are a convoluted type of security which coincidentally put the SEC in a place to gatekeep them - mostly due to them being a publicly traded fund and with investment advisors. The SEC otherwise does not judge the merit of investments, even the ones sold to the general public. The default is already a libertarian wet dream of letting investors decide for themselves. The SEC is not instructed by Congress to gatekeep investments. So this is an area worth criticizing on its own.
C) Some securities issuers, like JP Morgan, are able to "self-certify" some things, circumventing approval of the SEC.  Just like Boeing "self-certified" the 737-max. When JP Morgan and some others create new types of securities, they don't ask have to always ask permission. If JP Morgan wanted a Bitcoin ETF they could probably have just launched one unilaterally years ago. This is also an area worth criticizing.

credit default swaps are side bets that a company will default on their issued bonds and credit lines.
typically this functions more like insurance, where someone that actually bought a company's bonds are paying a monthly insurance premium to someone else that they'll get paid out if they lose money on the company's bonds in event of a default. it is a hefty monthly payment that you don't lose money when a company defaults. for speculators, you can also just try to profit from the credit default swap market.
anyway, bonds that have negative interest rates are still simply bets that the company won't lose all of your principle. it functionally just removes the middleman, and you retain the profit motive of the bonds going deeper negative because then you can just sell the bond to someone else at a profit. (lower the yield, the greater the bond price)

I'd like to see a post mortem for this on both compliance rationale and costs.
The Title III crowdfunding act limits your capital raise to $1,000,000 , a significant portion of which goes to lawyers for preparing the compliance documents.
Airbitz is doing that on both a registered crowdfunding portal, and "everyone worldwide" in bitcoin.
Title III crowdfunding requires you use registered crowdfunding portals, like Wefunder who wrote the law.
They are not using a crowdfunding portal for the bitcoin portion of the capital raise, making them noncompliant Title III crowdfund. (and I'm not aware of any bitcoin accepting registered crowdfunding sites)
It sounds to me like they should have just done an ICO for "gas" on their network. They would get more, quicker, with less liability.
**edit**: WeFunder uses Bitpay. Disregard concerns.

A) Because the only positive yielding bonds have a lower credit rating (and greater chance of losing all of your money)
B) Because many market participants are obligated to only buy bonds with higher credit ratings
C) Because one of those market participants is the central bank which is buying all the highly rated bonds and is the primary reason bonds are so overpriced that their yields are negative. They still have more to buy, yields keep getting depressed further.
Part C is happening to promote investing in Part A. Makes wealthy people stop hoarding cash and put it into riskier investments, an action that will keep money flowing in the economy.

Eth Crowdfunding capital raises are bigger than all Title III Crowdfunding capital raises.
Eth has large OTC markets for big sells.
Eth handles a daily transaction volume already half of what bitcoin handles daily. This is growing as more of the ICOs ramp up the projects they were funded for. It doesn't matter if they fail, most companies fail, its not a rebuttal.

more like new to markets in general, don't worry most people here have never traded anything besides cryptocurrency.
bitcoin's first bubble in 2011 was from $1 to $32, a 3,200% rally as anarchists and cryptologists and subcultures saw it. Before a 90% price crash back to a low of $2.
bitcoin's second noteworth bubble in early 2013 was from $20s to $240s, a 1000% rally as people a bit more integrated into society were accessing the bitcoin markets. typically middle class people in IT fields with just enough disposable income to take risks. before a 70% crash.
next up, late 2013 was from $100 to $1100, similar situation just broader pool of people again. before another 80% crash.
this rally is distinct in that it is much longer and gradual price increases so far, but it contains favorable news and regulations from big governments around the world and further integration into the financial system, such as inclusion in Fidelity's platform, a financial institution which manages 2.13 trillion assets.

utility + scarcity.
bitcoin's technical shortcomings actually do increase the scarcity. the transaction backlog means 1000s upon 1000s of bitcoin are off of the market in transit for days at a time.
even slightly increased demand will reveal the supply shock.
I consider this simple, simple supply and demand.
There are many companies that operate during business hours only and have to create bitcoin transactions on metalayers to run their business. 
ASCRIBE, Omni layer, Counterparty are fairly mature platforms.
You realize that all Tether transactions happen over the Omni Layer? 
There is a lot of infrastructure to support a BTC price increase.

Title III crowdfunding is broken. the limit is the death knell to the viability.

The signs of bubbles are when there are no more people to buy. This is why the saying is attributed to minimum wage workers because by the time they hear about a risk that requires spare income, and it seems worthwhile to them - as these are typically people without spare income - then thats the top of the bubble, because there is nobody else to buy from them.
and the entire population of the market will only be sellers, many of which will be fine accepting lower prices to get filled before other sellers.

Things that are different now:
- Direct USD, Euro, CNY, JPY markets for the biggest altcoins, with little to no transaction fees. Including deep OTC markets for block trades in alt coins.
- Direct USD and Credit Card markets for mid tier altcoins, with higher transactions costs. (As high as 30% on Changelly)
- Complete rails for bypassing bitcoin for the biggest altcoins, as even custodial altcoin exchanges offer fairly liquid altcoin pairs.
- Services that allow swapping between altcoins, without using bitcoin as an intermediary.
- Ability to temporarily settle altcoin value on a stable value system, like Tether. Despite Tether's problems you can move in and out of it on the blockchain (and its transactions ultimately settle on bitcoin's blockchain)
- The communications embargo on altcoins and bitcoin problems has been circumvented as bitcointalk and reddit are no longer the center of the community. Large Slack and Telegram channels disseminate information more quickly and efficiently.
Bitcoin's continued dominance would be a systemic risk in the event of a bitcoin crash, but it wouldn't be nearly as pronounced as 3 years ago, as the system will route around now, since it isn't required to denominate things in it. I view this as getting smaller and smaller, Poloniex currently being the actual systemic risk.

Currency is a technology.
What did currency look like 2000 years ago, what did it look like 200 years ago, what did an online purchase look like 20 years ago, standing in a checkout line only 5 years ago meant waiting for an old woman to write a check, if you were unlucky. 
You have no idea what was going on at FEDwire, or the point of sale terminal, or the US mint, or the futures market dictating the purchasing power of your paper dollars for the next few months. These are all currency technologies, and they are all highly specialized and confusing esoteric systems.

the amount of bitcoins that have to be bought up doesn't have to be the same at both price levels.
if the sellers all moved their asks to $8,000 per coin, then 0 bitcoin had to be purchased to move the price up to $8,000, just a mere satoshi.
similarly if Tim Draper put all of his coins at $399, then 30 million in bitcoin would have to be bought to move the price to $400
so since you aren't keeping track of those things, you can't make the claim about how much is necessary.

401k plans and IRAs are separate entities, just like a business is a separate entity. (corporations are people, except now you are in a privileged enough place in society where it is to your advantage as well)
any bank account would have to be in the retirement plan's name, which are usually trust accounts of a business, for benefit of you.
( BUSINESS ENTITY &lt;trust entity {for benefit of individual}&gt; )
your accounts on exchanges also need to be separately titled, where possible. where not possible (poloniex, coinbase, etc) just make sure to NEVER EVER EVER combine assets. and make separate wallets.

Thats not true, the stock market functions that exact way.
Snapchat offered X% of the company to venture investors,and got high valuations
Snapchat offered the same X% of the company to the stock market in an IPO, and all the money IN THE COMPANY came from the sell of that stock, and this is the only part of the company that people trade.
This is how all valuations work. There's a reason why people make fun of bitcoin as they re-learn and re-create the same world. But ultimately yet another generation exposes themselves to "boring finance for old people" one way or the other.
This is called the public float. Low float assets are a highly effective way of creating value, and also subject to much criticism. Hong Kong's stock market is taking that to the extreme right now

turns out this is a better example
in any case, the low in bitcoin value transactions which are the subject of debate have a large vocal opponent which simply doesn't seem to know what the low in bitcoin value transactions are frequently high in another asset's value.
most block explorers do not show assets that only exist in bitcoin's metadata. an analogy being imgur's own network value riding off the existence of reddit.
I think the *current* vocal opponent's simply don't have all the information about their argument. This is worth noting because the original opponents did not want anybody using bitcoin's metadata and also called those spam, and have been able to steer the discussion against all low value transactions without objectively mentioning what they are.

I can help you, a decade later and these nerds still haven't noticed people don't wrap their head around incorrect terms
currency = misnomer.
coin = misnomer.
mining = misnomer.
"bitcoin" is an asset in limited supply, which people can trade. All the words chosen are mere skeumorphs to what we consider to be antiquated and less useful forms of trade, only because other people relate to those words. Its like when the iphone's contact list used to look like pages from a notebook or rolodex when its not an address book or rolodex. Bitcoin is called bitcoin because "elliptic curve cryptographic ledger units" are much less relatable.
Bitcoin needs computational processing power to function. People that give the most computational processing power are rewarded in bitcoin. The kind of processing power bitcoin needs is very rudimentary, so whoever can do a rudimentary task the fastest gets the most bitcoin. This process is colloquially called "mining", as it is an analogy to having the best equipment to find gold, in a mine.
Back to GPUs? Well here's the thing, people stopped making computers that do one thing really good, DECADES ago. Because they are useless. *C*PU's are only things to brag about because they do GENERAL processing, everything, marginally faster and better than last year's CPUs. Making a computer that does everything, quickly, is hard. Making computers that do one thing really well is retarded. With that in mind, GPUs are good at doing some things really well, much better than CPUs.
People use them to process bitcoin stuff faster, than the rational people that use CPUs.
People have also made customized computer chips, single purpose processors, that only can process bitcoin. That is how 'mining' is done today for bitcoin. With these products called ASICs - merely stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit - there is nothing special about them as everyone knows how to make a single purpose processor for 50 years. Now there's a reason to again.
Yes, there are limits to how much bitcoin can be produced, and all bitcoin is aware of these limits. If you want to dive deeper, press 1.

eh, I think this is misleading and the IRS is a combination of totally incompetent and intentionally misleading.
The IRS is alluding to the idea that people create a statement from financial institutions they used to trade the asset, like how broker-dealers in the securities markets work. You connect your Etrade to Turbotax and get a nice filing automatically created with all the trades.
Bitcoin doesn't work like that as it requires no custodian, and 800 people or so manually created returns like that and listed Coinbase as their broker, which it isn't.
Many more people reported bitcoin or cryptocurrency profits on their tax statements. The IRS is able to create a dialogue by being intentionally misleading, a dialogue which is confirmed by the many people that do think they are "getting away with something" because they've never been in a profitable circumstance where their employer didn't automatically withhold all the taxes.
Tax compliance has ALWAYS been voluntary, except for the wage working plebes, so you can tell exactly what place in society people are in by the way they talk.

So what exactly do you have issue with? Bitcoin transaction fees being worth more than $700? Bitcoin's exchange rate being greater than $237? You just said some things that aren't rebuttals nor are coherent.
I can try to illustrative how it didn't add by pointing out some slightly related things: 
-The current block reward is 25 btc, which is currently around $6,000
- If the block reward was 3 btc, and the transaction fees were 3 btc, then this block contains 6 btc and bitcoin would have to trade at only $1000 for this block to have the same value as a 25 btc block today.
- Bitcoin being worth greater than today's price has nothing to do with transaction fees overtaking the block reward at some point in time, even possibly within the next couple halvings.

Right, I'm just pointing out that this level of time and convenience greatly diminishes the utility of bitcoin in the near term.
The poor are not the ideal demographic for bitcoin with the cost of micropayments (unless offchain). The wealthier are not the ideal for bitcoin because the time factor of transferring money is now nearly equivalent.
The middle and debt laden may find a $25 wire transfer fee too cumbersome because they are trying to move $100-$1000 usd. They can be a significant driving force of the price en masse, but Bitcoin's value proposition right now comes from there being a use case for several large funds, and those funds and institutions supporting them have nearly equivalent options.

You have to unlink your coins with Monero or Shadowcash first. (not any mixer/coinjoin/coinshuffle service, although Darkcoin's network should be fine for this, Darkwallet in bitcoin would not be fine for this).
 is the Monero client side software GUI.
 is there's. But shadowcash still requires you to download the whole blockchain or like, it isn't that easy just yet (I had syncing issues). Better instructions will surely come soon.
Both coin networks have their own gambling sites, but assuming you want bitcoin you can convert back after unlinking your transactions, and gamble with those bitcoin.
With Monero, when you do any transaction you need to manually put the mixin parameter to 3 or higher. There is a lot of research on this area, it is related to the way it chooses key sets. Monero has nothing to do with bitcoin, so there is a different body of research and analysis involved. But you can buy Monero with bitcoin.

Lightning brings cross atomic swaps for any coins that can operate a payment channel.
Operating a payment channel means that the coin has to be locked up, by being first bought, and then by being off the market and unable to move.
I don't think this supply constriction actually means a pop [read: bust] of the bubble. As economically the opposite would happen even in the face of static demand, let alone increased demand.
Since Bitcoin will be the last coin bitcoin-based-coin to implement Segwit + LN, there will be plenty of time for demand to continue in the face of disrupted supply. Payment channels should be pretty big and robust by then.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:16:23

All bitcoin in existence was mined. the other 70% was mined. whatever the entire market cap is, was earned by miners.
People compete to mine more bitcoin and have since the genesis block. This is why you think it is unfair that "miners" owned all the bitcoin, because you can't mine now. But the fact is that existing miners have invested and reinvested to maintain an edge in this area.
Those miners build infrastructure to make bitcoin have utility and worth, mainly pools and exchanges. Most miners are pools of smaller miners. So at this point in time, the wealth is distributed pretty well amongst new bitcoin.

This spam transaction
was worth $50,000,000. It was 100,000,000 units of Storj, which trades for $.50 each.
Storj moved off of Bitcoin's network to Ethereum's network last month. This would create a reduction in "spam" transactions. Many other "spam" applications are also incredibly valuable, and were growing a lot, too much to continue using bitcoin for them.

too bad exactly none of that happened in the busts over the last two weeks.
Alphabay was shut down, and they put up the seized notice. Turns out Hansa was being controlled for way longer, and they were just waiting for the mass influx of users from the Alphabay bust.
Then they took Hansa down. But only after altering a "we're not a honeypot" confirmation text file to instead be an Excel spreadsheet with a bunch of pretty stats, which recorded people's clearnet IP addresses and sent it to law enforcement.
In any case, BTC-e has multiple owners. They nabbed Alex for being associated with particular addresses involved in thefts that bankrupted exchanges all the way back to Bitcoinica. (But the exchanges all imploded due to their own incompetence, since Bitcoinica merely shut off the AWS server accidentally)

Fiat thefts and scams are so prevalent that they don't even make the news anymore. It is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. The same day Bitstamp lost $5 million in bitcoin, XOOM lost $30 million in massive criminal fraud. The hundreds of failed banks and blown up brokerage houses every single year do not make news, the hundreds of millions of credit card fraud instances and court cases do not make news.

Thats why many of us think it is less valuable than bitcoin.
Is your supposition that since bitcoin doesn't do that particular things, it has no value?
Bitcoin, crypto in general, is driven by its scarcity and utility. For gold, the utility you mentioned barely drive any of gold's scarcity.
Looking at your other responses I guess I have to explain crypto's utility. One moment, I'll edit it:
Its use in the capital markets has lowered the costs of raising capital for many projects. In the United States, securities regulations have stifled growth for a long time as it is too expensive to comply with the investor protection regulations such that only the most well funded organizations even consider the public markets. Many ideas simply cant get funded. Even the latest Title III crowdfunding regulations are too handicapped to be considered useful. Cryptocurrency "initial coin offerings" have had greater deal flow this year and last year than all Title III funding. It completely skipped the regulatory process and also attracts capital worldwide, while allowing everyone to be immediately liquid. This can be part of a growth engine and currently can be expected to grow. If you didn't catch on, this reinvesting within its own ecosystem further limits the scarcity of cryptocurrency, meaning that even in steady demand, participants will have to pay more for the remaining supply of bitcoin.
Many market participants use bitcoin at any price. Including those capital raises. As well as existing companies, and all of the e-commerce. These lead to a greater number of transactions
Currently, bitcoin is at max capacity with transactions, making for a worse user experience as transactions take longer to function. This has the effect of further limiting the supply of bitcoin available to purchase, as upwards of 2/5th of the daily transaction volume of bitcoin is off the market 'in transit' at any given point in time. In the case of even steady demand, people will have to pay more for the remaining supply of bitcoin on the market.
It doesn't matter if bitcoin goes up, or down, for A LOT of market participants. Most limited supply commodities are cyclical, seasonal even. Thats not controversial, except for people that trade them like stocks.
Now assume that instead of steady demand, we have increasing demand.
This all contributes to why a growing number of people find bitcoin to be a store of value, with an expected premium over gold. Gold has a nice sheen, history, and expected future use of being worn, and used as metal, but 99% of it is in vaults for nation states. For individuals it is cumbersome to store, transport, and break into units. Bitcoin is used in the capital markets, amongst other large p2p markets, and it is not cumbersome to store, transport and break into units.

Bitcoin is not a non-functional currency to US tax authorities, it is designated as property. This is because US tax authorities do not have ANY authority to decide what is a currency. Congress has that authority and has not weighed on the topic.

I would say 2014-2015
There was a lot of momentum in 2013 that got evaporated over a series of governmental and exchange problems. This is different from the 2011-2012 doldrums because we are still dealing with them.
The "ICO bubble" is the long-overdue antifragile response to the crypto-equity bubble. In 2012-2013 there were crypto stock exchanges, for actual companies that issued shares in cryptocurrency. 
- In September 2013 the US Government via the SEC shut down 3 exchanges at once
- In November 2013 the US Government via the FBI shut down Silk Road
- Mt Gox imploded shortly after
so the primary driver of capital growth, liquidity, commerce and conversion into the crypto-ecosystem was all gone fairly instantly.
and the price trended downward for over a year...  every bullish move was met with a big problem, even into 2015 it seemed the price was ready for another rally only for another big exchange to get hacked tragically.
fortunately during that time people did work on bitcoin proposals making it more secure and easier to own and hold bitcoin, exchanges did get funding needed to provide confidence and better systems
but it was a mess with no end in sight

A miner is already a first class node, and everyone else is a peasant node.
Do you have a rebuttal to that? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:50:16
So basically the only good masternode is the one running on a personal computer, but these are such a minority that the whole system is compromised and even these have flaws.
With masternodes you have to trust that the operator is not recording information about the coins/inputs they mix.
At least that trust is distributed amongst all masternodes, that one assumes do not communicate.
The problem arises that most of the masternodes are in data centers, from just a few providers, amazon and digital ocean, for example. The software processes themselves could be compromised completely, for years, in a blanket dragnet fashion, without anybody knowing. This could be by the data center operator, by an intelligence agency. I hope you have been keeping up, because these things aren't "conspiracy theories" anymore, just routine.
As such, all information about every transaction can still be linked and traced in a blockchain. It is analogous to taking the paper out of a shredder and simply using a program to put the whole document back together.
Every transaction you send with darksend requires LUCK to not be compromised. And you require that luck to persist until infinity. That is a poor system. The other side of the debate even reinforces this luck, you can get any darkcoin developer to show you a nifty graph of the chances your transaction is compromised, based on how many masternodes were bad actors. Luck.
Now back to the minority masternode operator that doesn't use a data center and instead uses a personal PC. Now you are trusting this person to not be data mining for themselves. Hm.
If you are interested in private cryptocurrency, Monero and Shadowcash are good candidates. They have their own development paths.  Darkcoin is an evolutionary dead end, at one point they were going to implement technology that shadowcash uses (zero knowledge proofs), at one point they were going technology that monero uses (ring signatures and stealth addresses), but each and every time they failed and opted for the masternode dilemma.
Incentivized nodes are a great idea that darkcoin brought to the table! Using them for mixing is not. Darkcoin plans to obfuscate the IP addresses of the masternodes, but this will not stop their software processes from being predictably run on Amazon, or congregating at another data center.

the phrase is that the IRS doesn't spend resources forcing people to pay taxes at every tax due date, it retroactively and randomly audits. it could do more to create automatic compliance, but it does not. even though your employer and your broker may withhold taxes for you, it is because they are voluntarily complying and just as paranoid about being randomly found noncompliant.

emphasis on exchange. Every centralized place trading things that are deemed as securities will be in violation of not registering as a broker dealer. The SEC can simultaneously fine them massive amounts of money AND freeze all their assets because they have judges ON STAFF! And yes, there is also the possibility of criminal liability too. If the exchanges try to play a cat and mouse game because "its cryptocurrency you can just move it no matter what the court order says", people are going to jail.
**worst of all, the SEC has already done this in cryptocurrencies.** They simultaneously shut down Bitfunder, Btct and litecoin trading co in september 2013, because they were trading unambiguous cryptosecurities (not ICOs)

if thats your assumption I should just clarify that I disagree on that. the chain analysis would have taken too long after mixing or draining the gox wallet overtime, and the exchanges would be too incompetent to implement all the addresses

Transaction congestion means 40% of bitcoin intended to be traded is stuck in the mempool.
