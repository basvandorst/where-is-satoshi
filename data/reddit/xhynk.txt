I apologize for the few days stagnation, it's my fault. I finally had $50 to invest in Bitcoin, sadly only when it hit 7,300, and I knew it would make it stop going up but I did it anyways. I'M SORRY

We all kick ourselves for not investing sooner. However, how many companies should we have invested in? Apple? Google? Nintendo?

You can replace written words with codewords that make sense.
Like if you have "Four", you can replace the written word "Four" with "Age I was when we adopted mittens the kitten". If you do that with a handful of the words, then the paper itself can be stored in a safe, encrypted in a text document and emailed to yourself, etc. and if it's ever discovered, it won'y mean much to anyone else but you.

I have no idea what's going on, but this post is probably because an hour ago BTC hit an ATH near like 7800, but over the past 10 minutes I've seen it go from 7350 &gt; 7050 and back again.

An easy way to see all this stuff, is no matter what the USD equivalent is, you always earn or lose the same percent.
If you buy $100 at $6k/BTC, and it goes up 10% to $6.6k, that 10% increase is the same you'll see, so you'll have $110.
If you buy $100 at $6k/BTC and hold until it gets up to $12k/BTC, you'll double your money and have $200.

Nobody knows. It could be worth $0 tomorrow or $10,000. The truth is, nobody knows. As interest and demand rises, it *should* go up, because there's demand.
Of course we all kick ourselves for not buying (or being able to buy) $100 worth of BTC last year, or the year before.
The "safest" thing to do, is not bury yourself in debt, because keep in mind you'll need to cash out that BTC to pay back the debt.
The next "safest" would be to buy with Dollar Cost Averaging. Buy $50, $100, $500, or whatever you're comfortable with right now. Then do the same tomorrow, or the next week, whatever price and timeframe works for you.
If you buy $1k now (~7.4k) and it crashes to ~3.7k tomorrow, but you buy another $1k tomorrow, you've essentially bought $2k at ~5.55k.
A reckless thing to do would be to dump it all in for 1 BTC now. But it may also never crash and be worth 1 BTC may be worth $50k after Christmas. So it's also reckless (in another way) to not put anything into it.
Keep in mind, I'm a noob and only just had a spare $70 to invest last week, so I'm the proud owner of 1% of 1 BTC, but that's my understanding.
I'd be leery to buy finance debt with BTC at this point, but that's the risk vs reward of investments. Because you'll still owe that $7,100 whether BTC lives, dies, or thrives.

In laymans terms, does this mean you can have only 1,000,000 tx's in the queue at like $.01, and you post a tx with a $1.00 fee, it will get processed ahead of the million existing ones, like a bidding war for tx speed?

If you're for real, go dig through your email and search for phrases like Wallet, BTC, Bitcoin, Satoshi, etc.
Anything that didn't have at least an email attached to it would've been pointless if it were an online wallet.
Unfortunately there were/are too many of those sites to name, especially from a few years ago. So many have come and gone, shadily or not. Your best bet is to trace through any email account you may have used to register.

If it's too good to be true, it is. Why would he take a willing $200 loss? You're better off buying from a trusted exchange like coinbase or using localbitcoins to buy in person if you want to avoid exchange fees. Again, I'm a noob but I'd absolutely avoid a quasi anonymous "too good to be true" deal

They should find one of those restaurants that takes XLM or BTC and buy him a fancy dinner!
This could have gone SOOO differently, but holy crap some of the best cryptocurrency news I've heard in a long time!

Looking to see if someone maybe dropped one of those "Bitecoin" things ��
