Very Funny.  Now when the winter blues comes what?

Well that is totally true.   Even more when bitcoin adoption can not be fought or stopped by the existing system.

Bitcoin is not for the average person.   This is my experience talking to colleagues/friends/family that have been interested.  
For people to see value in Bitcoin they would have to understand why there will be limited amount and impossible to counterfeit, how is it decentralized, how is it so safe to buy/hold/transfer/exchange, and how is it becoming recognized across the globe as Gold has always been.
There are some minimum mathematical and also computer science concepts that a person must  understand with more or less detail.
And on top of that, people shall understand that currently the price will fluctuate according to the actors involved, as if a new commodity new valuable metal or material that few know and trust.
Just my 0.02

I live in Venezuela, glad that your post raises awareness of the humanitarian crisis here.   On the donation itself I don't know, I believe in other ways to help, through reputable NGOs directly focused on the crisis.   has a wide network of volunteers dedicated to save children from starvation.  They publish quarterly bulletins and have the support of the Catholic Church, meaning the criminal government can not interfere with their work.   For disclosure I am not affiliated with them.

I wonder how long have you been into Cripto?  Life does not revolve around Coinbase; it is not "Yamamoto"; and why would he disrupt the Bitcoin market?   Absurd.

Actually I could use some tips for flagging this and saving people's time reading advertising.  18oWESEjPzSqTdPq5McsBMbkqYuchhwy7A

Well if you can't make or tolerate jokes about your leader it's a sign of being ready for totalitarism.   Think about it and have a nice life some day

Wrong spelling though

I can see the point in the 4th industrial revolution, it can be viewed that way...   Can't see however how blockchain/Bitcoin technology can make an oil field operation greener.   Surely adding it in a slide makes you cooler.

Because fiat is already adopted and works for the average person for daily basic transactions without needing to understand that it is (was) only paper+trust

Keep an eye on Trump's tweeter account, you know he invented the internet before bitcoin

There are Merkle Trees and a (Meghan) Markle Family Tree.   At first I was going to start explaining the latter, which is a lot more complicated than any blockchain concept

Chinese will be able to double spend their coins, internally and externally.   Whatever value the internal Bitcoin-China value results after the fork.

Hey you've been here forever.   I'm with you, you can call Satoshi as you please.

People seem to believe in the intrinsic value of Baseball Cards, so when I tell them Bitcoin is of a limited supply, increasing in value, and already recognized around the world, then the conversation starts to flow.

Whales see this and chuckle.   They sell on high and buy back cheap, anytime, no sweat.   For most of us though buying and HODL is standard

Via Telegram?... I have been contacted by scammers via Reddit Chat twice this week.  They come with newly created users, and start casual talk via the Reddit Chat and then same story, a link to a site where you should enter with thousands in BTC and duplicate your money in days.  Seems they can be talking to you forever if you show some interest.  When they are excited enough about me going for it I just block and report them

Read your own post Mr Wright.    You will keep being roasted until that typo is fixed.

That probably would mean longer block times   Solar system only is a more realistic goal.  It's already been to the moon.

You can always use Bitcoin anonymously and peer to peer as conceived (Criminals also but that's another subject).   Exchanges and Localbitcoins are formal businesses so they must have their clients ID registered, to me it does not mean governments are putting their hands on BTC.    The guitar you see in my avatar was paid directly in BTC.   You are right regarding taxes, but as people say it may be easier to avoid death.

? Why buy from a bank something they do not carry like bitcoin?   Localbitcoins.
