Correct, the record is 193 minutes (after the first block that is)
See here...

The 10 minute block time is just an estimate based on the current difficulty level of finding a block.  Every 2016 blocks the difficulty is recalculated based on the current hashing power being used to find blocks.  If blocks average 10 minutes each, that would mean difficulty would be recalculated exactly every 14 days.
The long block generation time could just be a fluke.  The other explanation is that a bunch of hash power that was online at the last re-targeting went offline.  Based on the current charts that doesn't look to be the case (
I'd just call it bad luck.
EDIT: And now more bad luck, the next one is already 30 minutes and going...

It doesn't mean they are using that using power on hashlets at all. They may just rent the power out to other companies effectively double dipping. I use to make 2.5 BTC a day from them one week the next I was at 0.9 BTC due to the utter failure of ZenPool and issues with the second pool etc.  That's when I sold 2000 Zens and 1600 Primes, for a nice profit as I was in early. Their inability to even do the most basic of functions belies underlying issues that make their grandiose claims ridiculous at best.
I've posted extensively at HashTalk and been down voted to hell several times by their minions for calling their white paper pure techno babble garbage.  They propose a Crypto currency backed by a bank? What the fuck? I'm no libertarian, not that there's anything wrong with that, but banks and their manipulation are exactly why we're in this'd place today.
The other bullshit they spout is that BTC volatility is why merchants don't adopt. What the hell? Merchants typically do a straight conversion to fiat, they experience no currency risk at all. $80 jeans gets $80 in fiat regardless of BTC/USD rate. Sure GAW let's invent a new currency backed by a failing one, good mine.
Bunch of posers with a leader with a God complex. Dateline NBC and 60 Minutes here we come.

Maybe, but I gotta say this is much more reasonable than that jackass from Mastercard from a few weeks ago.
