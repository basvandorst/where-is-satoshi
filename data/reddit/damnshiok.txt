Just came across this, and wanted to shared my experience to see if there is anything in common. 
I use a Linux machine, a complicated and unique password (via LastPass), 2FA (Google Authenticator) and often VPN to access itbit. Sometime on 2016-07-04 UTC. my password was changed, and a new 2FA was added, and a new subwallet was created. A market order buy was made to convert all fiat to BTC, and then all BTC was withdrawn to 1NUjYTWpazHVUTYvDhAJShDuFcimmBHAoA at 2016-07-04 19:49 UTC. What made this even more weird was that I did NOT receive the login emails nor the password/2FA changed emails that should have been sent out. When I asked itbit support, I was told there was some issue with the email notification server at the exact same time. Also, after I requested for IP logs from itibit, it showed that on 2016-07-04 UTC 19:54 there were unauthorized logins from the Tor network. Notice this is AFTER the time of the BTC withdrawal.
So when I tried to log in on 2016-7-5 morning, I realized my pw was changed, and promptly emailed itbit about it. They managed to stop the BTC withdrawal in time. On my end, I reformatted my Linux machine and checked very carefully if anything else was compromised (nothing else was). When itbit eventually gave me back access to my account, I changed the pw, changed the 2FA and I thought that was the end of it. However, on 2016-07-10 16:53 UTC, the attacker once again somehow gained access to my account, canceled my existing BTC withdrawal, and attempted to withdraw to 1NUjYTWpazHVUTYvDhAJShDuFcimmBHAoA again! I caught this quickly and canceled it. This time, there weren't any logins there were from suspicious IPs, so while it does seem like my machine was compromised again on my end, I don't believe that is so because I have both local and web wallets open on the same machine which were untouched.
To date, itbit still has not updated on how this hack occurred. And it seems the attacker has successfully gotten 5BTC from someone else.

Traditionally, a company issue stocks through stock exchanges. You pay them fiat for shares. The ledger of who owns how much stock is kept by the brokerage and the company who issued the stock. If they do well, the shares you bought will be worth more, which you can sell for fiat to realize a profit. They could also issue dividends, which you get in fiat, or in more shares.
Now, overstock.com can issue shares through the blockchain. Which means you can pay the company bitcoins, and the company can send you special bitcoins which represents their shares (this is the colored coin concept). Thus the ledger of who owns how much stock is recorded transparently in the blockchain.  If they do well, the shares you bought will be worth more, which you can sell for bitcoin to realize a profit. They could also issue dividends, which you can easily get in bitcoin or in more shares.

You have to enable 2FA before they approve your request to change it from 72 hours to 24 hours. Of course, everyone should enable 2FA regardless. I wouldn't call 24 hours quick though. It is actually processed at the end of the working day after the 24 hours holding period. So if you initiate a withdrawal on Thursday night, they won't send it out until Monday night.

Another possibility is coincidental false positive.
EDIT: After much flip-flopping and deliberation, it seems that the probability of a coincidental false positive is quite low, and all these new flare ups by AVs are due to [someone calling for prankers to send bitcoins to crafted bitcoin addresses]( which deliberately code for [virus signatures from this list.](
These malicious addresses will forever be in the chainstate .sst files because nobody has the private keys to spend them. While they will also be in the blk.dat files, because bitcoin-qt accesses the chainstate more frequently than the blk.dat files, AVs will find matches in the chainstate files more frequently.

It's very probable. Copied my post elsewhere in the thread the reasons:
Firstly, has confirmed that for this case, the offending files were the [chainstate .sst files which only contains information about unspent outputs]( I don't think they can be used to store arbitrary data. That can only be done in the raw block chain which are in .dat files.
Secondly, false positives occur frequently. In this case, [the stone virus signature can be as short as 40 bits]( That's pretty short, and given enough random data, it might actually be coincidentally reproduced.

Are you sure it is in a sst file? I thought those were the chainstate files which contains only information about unspent outputs? I would imagine the virus signature would be stored in one of the raw blk*.dat files which are 134 MB each.
edit: the index for the blockchain are also .sst files. but they should only contain block metadata, and not raw transaction data.
edit2: someone confirmed they were in the chainstate .sst files. so probably coincidental false positive.

When trying to sell everything in my balance, even though I switched to BTC and entered my entire balance, Circle changes that to the USD value. And during the short period when it requests the 2FA code, the BTC price dropped such that the same USD value is now a higher BTC amount, which exceeds my BTC balance. However, circle still allowed me to confirm the sell, and it ultimately failed after a couple hours.

It seems you are talking about a mobile wallet to use bitcoins on the go, away from a computer. There are already SMS services (coinbase and blockchain.info) that allows you to send bitcoins. Granted, you are not actually using bitcoins directly. But if you think about it, when you make payment using credit cards, you are also not actually using USD directly, instead you are relying on a third party to make USD payments on your behalf. Also, there are upcoming services that integrates bitcoins into the existing debit card system such that you simply swipe this special debit card, their backend debits your bitcoin account and pays the merchants in USD.

Not very good with probability, but I'll try.
40 bits =  2^40 = about 1 trillion
So we need just 40 trillion bits, to expect 1 match (but should be lesser since we can count partial strings).
40 trillion bits = 5 trillion bytes = 5 TB
And that is to match just 1 virus signature. There are over [20,000,000 possible virus signatures]( that might match, so I would expect a false positive in much much less random data.
So yes, I think the monkeys can do that.
edit: changed billion to trillion. bad math.
edit 2: I started with wrong string length. It should have been 80 bits, which actually makes it very unlikely to have been a false positive! :\
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:21:47


I can't vouch that someone did it, but the longer the virus signature, the possibility that this was an accidental matching sequence of bytes rapidly diminishes. Chances are it was intentional.

I think data in general might still be recoverable should the attacker have access to your phone soon after the deletion and the data on the flash memory is still not yet overwritten.

Hey looks like you need a TechnicalLessononBTC. The bitcoin network's 7 transaction per second (TPS) is currently artificially limited by the block size limit of 1 MB. When the transactions start to increase, the network will increase the block size accordingly to accommodate a higher TPS rates. As of now the network can already theoretically match VISA's TPS if needed.

It depends. If your transaction size is less than 1000 bytes, you can even send it out without any fees. But it seems that your 0.05 BTC is probably made up of many small inputs. This will result in a large transaction size when you try to send it out. The current recommendation is 0.0001 BTC per 1000 bytes. Wallets like BitcoinCore will calculate the recommended fee for you, and you can choose to change it. If you set it too low, it might take a long time to confirm, but you won't lose the coins.

At the end of the day, rooting and installing custom ROMs on your phone is a double edged sword. If you know what you are doing, it can actually enhance security. 
Many 3rd party ROMs like CyanogenMod patch their libraries such as OpenSSL faster than stock. They allow you to fine tune permissions on a per app basis. You can lock root access with a PIN. You can install tracking apps like Cerberus as a system app that persists through the factory reset in Android. You can enable system wide ad blockers, shutting out any phishing sites.
But if you have no idea what you are doing and you are the type that will foolishly give untrusted apps root access, then yes, you are better off not rooting your phone.
edit: plus for the tinfoil hatters, most 3rd party ROMs are fully open source, so it will be more difficult to hide any intentional or unintentional security lapses. most handset manufacturers either don't release source code, or do so much later.

Let's not click on sensationalized linkbait. If you have to read it, here:
Don’t feel like paying the Australia Tax for Watch Dogs? That’s the excuse people will be using to illegally download the new Ubisoft epic later this week, but pirates beware: you never really know what you’re getting in an illegal download. You might just be installing a Bitcoin miner on your computer.
Torrents are popping up online for cracked versions of Watch Dogs‘ PC version before the official release date tomorrow, but you should exercise a deal of caution before nabbing them.
According to Slashgear, many of the illegal copies include a file buried inside the game’s install files called “Winlogin.exe”. It disguises itself as a copy of a legitimate process on your machine, and actually turns your PC into a covert Bitcoin miner.
For those unaware of how Bitcoin mining works, it basically uses resources from your computer’s GPU to break down complex algorithms. Those who crack the algorithms are rewarded with a block of Bitcoins for their trouble.
The only issue with Bitcoin mining is when you covertly get other people’s computers to do it. That’s what this hidden process does: it siphons up to 25 per cent of your computer’s GPU power to mine Bitcoins, and then sends them off to someone else’s bank account.
Someone in Australia had the bright idea to find a highly-powered computer at their workplace and use it to mine Bitcoins too. The problem was that the workplace was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the computers were used to render programming. Whoops.
You might be getting a cheaper copy of the game, but you’re hurting yourself if you choose to do it. [Slashgear]

I use Ubuntu, and I actually prefer to do the pip install method. Why? Because that way I am directly installing from ThomasV (lead electrum dev). If you choose the PPA route, you have to trust 1 more person/group to honestly package the software without inserting any malware. In this case the PPA maintainers are [Vasudev Kamath and Tristan Seligmann]( who don't seem to be directly part of the dev group. Additionally, for the PPA route, users might have set the updates to be automatic, so they won't have a chance to save their coins should the PPA maintainers go rogue.
EDIT: Identified the maintainers. But same story, you need to additionally trust these guys.
EDIT2: Someone pointed out that the pip route means you have to trust the pip maintainers, but deleted his comment. It's a good point, so I think it boils down to which group has a bigger reputation to lose and who you would rather trust more.

If it is back and forth between 2 addresses, the next send will have to wait on average 10 mins (1 confirmation) before the network will accept it. Wouldn't be a problem for the network. Besides, the network will probably be happy to earn the transaction fee, and if fees aren't included, the back and forth transaction will probably happen even more slowly.

2FA is only important for LastPass in verifying you are who you claim to be, and then allowing you to retrieve your encrypted password database. For KeePass, everything is local and hence is considered less risky than LastPass.
LastPass caches a copy of the encrypted password database on your computer. If you are infected with malware that has access to your filesystem, the encrypted database can be stolen. And if your LastPass master password gets keylogged, your password database can be decrypted without needing 2FA.
Bottomline is: KeePass can be more secure compared to LastPass, but LastPass is really very convenient since it syncs all your password online.

I disagree. If the photocopier gets sold or exchanged (if rented), the new owners or technicians will have access to the data. [This has been happened before, sensitive data has been leaked, resulting in lawsuits.]( If you are photocopying a paper wallet without encryption, you never know if one day someone will come across it in the photocopier HDD and sweep you funds. To mitigate that, BIP38 will help a lot. My solution: just copy the 1 line BIP38 encrypted address using a pen and paper. You don't spend from a paper wallet everyday so the little inconvenience of typing in the encrypted address shouldn't be a problem.

2FA should be done properly.
- Email: DO NOT use email as 2FA. If an attacker has your password, they likely have compromised your computer and also have access to your email.
- SMS: DO NOT use Google Voice for SMS verification due to same reason as above. A dumb phone is probably safer than a smart phone as smart phones can be infected with malware which can access SMSes.
- Google Authenticator:  Good option, but make sure to store back ups in an OFFLINE device, not on the phone itself as malware can steal them, and definitely not your main working computer.
- Yubikey: IMO the best method, as it is impossible to be duplicated. Requires your physical presence to press a button to generate an OTP, so can't be hacked over the net even if you leave it plugged into your computer. Disadvantages are that it costs $25 and requires trust in the manufacturer.

In the future, we'll see people paying with bitcoin in stores fumbling to scan QR codes, and then fumbling again to type in their PIN to send the payment. IMO, the ease of transaction at POS isn't really an advantage compared to credit cards.

FYI, all the PIN protection on current mobile wallets very weakly protect you. If I'm not wrong, the PIN doesn't even encrypt your private keys. They are sitting in your phone storage unencrypted. Even if they did encrypt them, a 6 digit PIN can be brute forced in seconds.

An attacker could redirect electrum.org to their own servers which runs a copy of the original website, but with a malicious version of the wallet. The attacker would then sign the malicious wallet with their PGP key, and provide a link to their PGP key ID on the download page. I actually don't know who ThomasV is (sorry), how do I know I can absolutely trust him? HTTPS can help people (especially laymen) to prevent such an attack. All they have to do is check whether the URL button lights up as green.
EDIT: Just saw on the page that ThomasV is the creator/maintainer. Great job Thomas! Love Electrum!!

Google Authenticator doesn't use any special propietary format. You can generate the same TOTP codes using other software given the secret key. [You can even program any Yubikey to generate this TOTP.]( So, if Google does remove Google Authenticator, we can still continue to use those websites with 2-factor authentication. However, if Kim decides to sue all companies that use any form of 2-factor, then it might be a problem.

Yes they support PAM with Yubikeys! The PAM module is already in the same Ubuntu PPA I described in my guide. Here's more info 
Also, since Yubico says you can use PAM with Yubikey offline using HMAC-SHA1 challenge response, you should be able to program your desktop (PAM) with the same secret key you use for Google Authenticator!
