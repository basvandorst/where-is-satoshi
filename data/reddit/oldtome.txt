During the talk Andreas mentioned a way to backup a wallet by somehow generating a set of 12 to 20 words that you could simply memorize.
Did anyone catch that and know what software/method he was referring to?

More information for them to track. If they get your wallet.dat(s) they get a list of bitcoin addresses tied to your identity. 
Which by itself is not a big deal, but if they do the same for others and find links in the transaction history they will have started to piece together relationships with other "persons of interest".

I think it'll have an extremely corrosive effect on the state over time. How long it'll take is anyone's guess. But the state and its fiat mandated money comes from central authority.  Bitcoin is completely decentralized, a peer-to-peer mandate. They are diametrically opposed.
I see what's happening in Argentina et al. as a precursor to what's going to start happening all over the world.  People will start seeking out a way to get around the ever increasing taxes, policies, costs, and rigmarole of doing simple business.  And they'll naturally gravitate to Bitcoin as its gaining impedance and acceptance every day.
And at some point it'll click in the collective heads' of people that they can just stop playing the fiat money game.  I have hope that people will realize that their assets and any value they receive by hard work or innovation can be theirs alone to do with as they wish without anyone or any state telling them or forcing them what to do.
