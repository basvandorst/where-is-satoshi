I did a transaction yesteday and stupidly decided to pay 3 sat/b. Still 0 confirmations... 
Not urgent though 
At this point in the market, seeing a high number of transactions isn't bad. Bottom probably is not in yet and volume is still quite low.

My current wallet doesnt give me that option
Any recommendations?

Great another brainwashed bcash soul.
Im just pointing out that every single person that has spent bitcoin in the past years has ended up regretting it. Its fine to spend some on a pizza or LN. Of course spend whatever you want, but avoid spending what is scarce and likely to be way more valuable (more than what we probably can imagine) in the future. I commented because of the lazslo story.
Theese times its important to concentrate on stackingsats

Same here
In the early days I enjoyed transacting with friends and stuff
But now its all about accumulation, if I can pay a pizza in dollars Ill pay in dollars 
Btw that pizza looks amazing man

Chill bruv, u must have a lot of time on your hands
I dont want to change anyones bloody mind 
True bitcoiners dont try to convince anyone about shit
I do spend my bitcoin but I would rather use usd
Lets revisit the conv in a decade and see if you would still have spent 540000sat on a pizza(again, there is nothing wrong with that) just saying that value isnt created through merchants 
Have a good one mate
