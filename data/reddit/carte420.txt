because even if they did that they still can control EVERYTHING ... the originator of bitcoin would then be the most powerful person... Government stick to tangible things they can manipulate like money and gold

Nope.. no coincidence.. but if an embargo is placed on them.. they’ll be fine.. that’s what I mean.. they have oil to carry on factories.. etc..

1. Because no one with money wants to buy any part of Venezuela rn... give it after the election. 
2. Venezuela although I’m not there.. they are fine.. as in they are able to self sustain themselves... the way I see it, it’s the economic decline for the super incline for them. 
3. Venezuela has poised itself as a superpower of the future... they have oil and the power of technology 
4. We are entering the globalist era... Venezuela will suffice without Guidado.. 
5. It’s all in time and calming the people to let them understand the value of their land... you can’t sell land just like that and not expect other sources of the land sale not to back his claims if the time comes. 
6. You cant just sell out for short term gain.. taking care of your people for 10 years and then putting them back in economic distress isn’t it. 
7. People often get brain washed by a standard of living.. that makes us psychologically depressed.. hence why a lot of communists don’t want media influence from external sources.. it puts people down for long periods and blinds their inhabit ions to see that they are free... 
8. May look rough now, but with Venezuela being backed by Russia is gonna keep them strong. 
9. It’s a big country with vast resources.

They have the infrastructure of factories.. which means the cost to restart is much less if they had none at all.. plus the electricity to keep those factories running is available. 
All of this happened because of Hugo being gone. They got their wish.. so this is the economic decline.. a clean slate if you wish.. once America stops fucking with them.. and the people watching, Venezuela should be on a rise.. albeit it may take some time.

It’s not like it’s a lie... plus that’s the narrative they want to paint. You being in the know shouldn’t  be mad, but glad you have eyes to see. 
In any case it puts an auto sync into people’s minds about it; whether curiosity or not. 1% will get the impetus to understand.
