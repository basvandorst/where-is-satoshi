Bought at 8.9, 9.8, 13, 16.  Sold at 17.5.
Probably going to buy back in very soon.

Ever hear of the FDIC?
My point is there is no such organization for Bitcoin.  Consumer confidence is going to be a major hurdle for crypto if we ever want the average Joe to adopt the currency.  That's just the way it is.

The US economy is 18.5 trillion USD.  If BTC was at 1 million a coin then market cap would be 21 trillion.  
21 &gt; 18.5
Common sense is that IF BTC market cap exceeds the largest economy in the world then that would have to mean the dollar has been largely abandoned and or economic chaos.  I don't see how that's all that hard to imagine at that hypothetical BTC price.
And why do you keep responding twice to each of my comments?  Just put everything in one comment.

Yes it does, you use your bank ID to login but not an account number.  The most anyone could do with that number is download an app and possibly transfer money between my checking account and savings account, of course they'd also need my phone number, Gmail account and personal info to even activate the app to my account.

Bought at $19k, thinking of selling right now at $16k.  This is just too much stress.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:22
About $3.50.  I want a cheeseburger.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:34
It's really hard to tell here sometimes.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:54:19
Well I bought at $16k and sold at $15k I think I'm doing this right imo.

Jesus..I had to edit my comment because it was drunkenly typed.  I've been drinking cranberry margaritas and taking tequila shots while wrapping presents... Holy shit.
Cheers!  Hodl, my friend.

If the Bitcoin is ever worth 1m/coin then we are already in a massive economic collapse and subsequent anarchy.  There's no way the US economy or world economy can survive BTC at 1 million.
Being hopeful/optimistic is fine, but actually wishing for 1m without recognizing the devastation it would bring is severely shortsighted.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:44


21 million coins at 1 million each puts the market at above the entire US GDP.  
Holding to 1 million is an unreasonable expectation.

I want alt coins to be a big deal.  I know some of the alt coins offer superior tech along with it.  But, that said, BTC is still considered the "gold standard".  My fear is throwing a large amount of fiat into alt and then losing my ass when it's not adopted in any way other than trading on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:37
Where did you put the buy order in at?  Shouldn't it bet set to market price at time of the order?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:38
It's depressing honestly, but I think it just makes me more willing to hear people out when they talk about investment opportunities instead of just dismissing them.  
On that same token, I learned that sometimes group think doesn't know wtf they are talking about.  I should have continued mining then and not listened to people.  Although, to be fair, no one could have known we'd ever see a near $20k BTC.  
A couple months ago I threw about $1k into Apple and while I saw some gains, I would have been much better off throwing it into BTC.

Man, I had LTC when it was worth pennies.  I had a few dozen I earned from mining.  Feels bad knowing I lost those on a hard drive.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:08
Greed?  
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:35
I mined in the early days.  Only ever held .73 BTC and a few dozen LTC.  I believe at the time BTC was about $50 each.  If I remember correctly this would have been in like 2010-11.
My hard drive crashed one day, I lost it all.  But honestly I wasn't even upset because I was mining 24/7 for near no rewards and everyone told me at the time that I was spending more on power than gaining coin.  I figured it wasn't worth it anyway 
I did wire some money back in the mtgox days and had a couple coins I think I got for about $100 each.
Again, gone.  It's whatever.
I'm holding fractions of a coin at this point.  :/

The value of something is only worth what people are will to attribute to it's value.  In this sense, fiat, gold, or BTC, are all relative.  Limited supply, or unlimited supply, how much does one unit of that currency go towards a gallon of milk?  
Trust in a monetary system, regardless of which one, is the most important metric.  Without it, nothing else will matter.

I'm being a wiseass, but I did buy in at $6k, $9k, and $12k.
Tempted to buy more and hold.

Bitfenix, Binance, Coinbase

That's a double edged sword.
I'm sure there's large swaths of people who prefer governing bodies guaranteeing the currency they use.  And they may not be able to seize your Bitcoin, but Bitcoin also isn't insured in any way.  If it's lost, hacked and stolen or whatever you're not getting it back ever.  If a person steals you identity and charges false purchases to your bank account you petition it and it's almost always recovered for you.
I get it, some people think the government and fiat is a terrible thing.  But those people are a minority.
All I'm trying to say here, is crypto has a lot of potential, but too many people think it's this perfect substitute to fiat and I just don't think it's quite there yet.  It has many hurdles to get over.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:48
Isn't that dude holding a ton of shit coins though?  
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:19
Well, let's be fair here.  The dollar is backed by one of the world's largest economies and also probably more importantly the world's strongest and largest military.  These two things alone are huge confidence boosters for people using the dollar.  That's confidence currently which cannot be replicated by crypto for the average consumer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:00:52
Greed and speculation.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:12
I had .73 BTC back in about 11' and a few dozen LTC.  They are lost and will never return.  
Feels bad man.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:27
The one thing to remember is if BTC hits 1 million then market cap for it will be larger than the total US economy.  That's a scary thought.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:46
Here's the thing about the USD, it's currently backed by the largest economy in the world and the strongest military.
I think crypto is pretty cool, but there is a certain amount of security you get with the USD.  Unless something major happens in 5 years this guy's prediction is poop.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:45
It means BTC is the *future*.

If you hold 100k in cash in your house you're doing it wrong.
However, if it is stolen from your bank account or retirement account you have avenues for recovery that are generally painless.  I know this because I've had to recover $3k in fraudulent activity.

In about 2011 I had a couple GPUs for sale on Craigslist, both of them Radeon's if I remember correctly.  Anyway, a guy offered me my asking price in Bitcoin at the time.  I was asking about $400 I think.  Anyway, I told him "no thanks, I would prefer actual money."
This memory hurts my heart.
When Bitcoin hit $100 I said, "I would buy some at $50 because this is just too expensive right now." I said the same thing at $500, $1k, and even last month at $6.9k.
This memory hurts my heart.
At one point I had .75 BTC and a few dozen LTC I had acquired from mining back the the mtgox days that I lost when my hard drive crashed, but I didn't even care then because I always thought they were worthless.
This memory also hurts my heart.
The short of it is, I suck.  This is depressing.
