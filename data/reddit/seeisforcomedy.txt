You and me both.

Fun fact, there's a distinct difference between "restarting" and "shutting down." If IT isn't telling you to shut down instead of restart they need to GET IT TOGETHER.

The network is super clogged right now so transactions are taking forever. To use the ledger all you need is the chrome app and the bitcoin app installed on the ledger itself. Don't need your phone. Ledger manager is the chrome app you can use to manage what apps are on your ledger.

Experimental red?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:17
They are supposedly implementing segwit in January, I'm going to wait until then to send anything from there.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:45:53
In their defense the original theatrical release had him saying run instead of fly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:51:53
Not like I'd be able to move my btc to sell it right now anyways. Dat mempool.

So what's stopping people from buying on gemini, then sending to coinbase to sell for instant profits?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:49
For some reason coinbase is still trading higher than other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:11
If you use limit buys/sells on GDAX there are zero fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:20:59
Anything with Matt Berry is a gem.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:35:34
Don't like their method of verification though, not about to give you the login to my bank.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:16
Same, sold some at 8850. Still have some but waiting to buy back in.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:02:31
Odd, I used my segwit address on me ledger the other day and it was a couple bucks and took a while.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:03:17
Countless I say!
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:25:12
I have a ledger, it's awesome. Haven't used a Trezor but people praise it as well. I think no matter which one you choose you will be pleased :).
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:17:50
I just keep mine at home. It's the seed key you really need to keep safe.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:19:00
Sheeeeit GDAX is 2-4 business day deposit time.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:13:15
From a segwit, the accepting address however was not, perhaps that is the issue. Was sending to gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:22:59
When you set up the ledger your'll receive a list of seed words, this is what you use to recover the wallet if it is ever destroyed/lost/stolen etc. The seed words are your private keys for your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:52:06
Wish GDAX didn't take so long to deposit to. Who knows what it will be at when I can actually spend the money. Should really start keeping some money in there ready to go.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:37:13
Quitting your browser and re-opening can sometimes help. If you have the recovery words I would just recover the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:26:24
Yeah I have a deposit that is still pending as well. Caused me to miss the dip which sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:17:07
It did go into the 5k range.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:41:34
I plan to sell some to buy the dip, but want to keep a decent amount in btc for the free coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:17
Me, this shit is hilarious to watch.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:33:32
I sold some at 8850 from a sell limit i had set up, wasn't expecting this meteoric rise. Patiently waiting or I'll just go buy something nice for myself instead.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:20:01
What exchange are you using to convert btc to eth? Bittrex?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:44:59
No, you can set up a PIN that lets you access the USB when plugged into a computer. I believe you can also set up 2 factor authentication somehow. If the PIN is guessed wrong 3 times it wipes the ledger and you have to recover it with the seed keys if memory serves.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:24:06
Yeah, only quick option I have has pretty huge fees, like 6% or something stupid like that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:30:37
gdax lets you do it
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:32:38
Nah mine is still "Pending." Banks being closed Friday didn't help either.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:09
OH MY GODDDDDDD
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:37:27
what exchanges can I sell btg on? I have some on my ledger from the split I believe.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:20:36
What's a good wallet for doing that? Don't think I'll get a hardware one in time, currently using breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:45:47
Do you control your personal keys with mycelium? I will probably eventually get a trezor but need something in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:05:16
So it seems mycelium takes the paper wallet approach? Seems simple enough.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:29:34
Yes you are wrong. But that's ok! What you want to do is move them to a wallet where you control the private keys, then wait. See if replay protection is added, then figure out if you can get free coins. If replay protection is never added, just forget about free coins in my opinion, not worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:28:24
With that much BTC I would spring for a hardware wallet. Well worth the investment. I love my ledger nano s, handles all sorts of alt coins too.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:33:04
Couldn't someone with one of the other methods have just booked a plane ticket? What were the rules of this race?
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:27:20
Interesting, it's jumped quite a bit in the past month then. I remember recently it was around 2.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:49:31
I understand the reasoning behind it. Just seems if it keeps creeping its detrimental to the idea of use cases. Time will tell I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:58:56
can bitgold and b2x even be claimed yet? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:11:54
aren't core and segwit the same thing now?
