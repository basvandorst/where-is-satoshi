What point did I miss exactly?
You think that the world's governments are coming to end, or at least are going to face an impending serious crisis - enough to destroy the value of national currencies and the national economy - and to support this you cite the few examples of failed economies in 2nd-world countries.
This is apocalyptic fear-mongering ('It's coming'), and it's been around for decades. Yawn.

Yes, I've read this argument, but it doesn't seem likely or even make rational sense for several reasons.
For instance, doing dozens of *both* buy and sell trades (and we're talking large amounts for both) within *a single hour*.

Perhaps I will do a more comprehensive post on this later sometime, since it seems to be a popular cop-out amongst Bitcoin bagHODLers.

We're all heard that at $900, $700, $600, $500, etc.
You are a self-described 'perma-bull' who bought in at higher prices.

When I read this, I see the following:
I robbed ~$100,000 from other Bitcoiners who were attempting to rob me. The remaining Bitcoin bagHODLers now have $100,000 less to divide amongst themselves.


Name one.


Again, name one.

Sure thing bro; I'm sure the rest of us all know what you mean.

Well you better get used to hearing it, because no one has yet refuted it. No one has demonstrated, or to my knowledge even claimed, that the Willy Report is fake. The MtGox database is available for anyone to verify the evidence presented in the Willy Report.

Yes, this is the same 'desperation' I felt when I said pretty much the same thing at $700

BTW, there are 513 altcoins on Coinmarketcap
So to address your main point about altcoins, you would *not* be a millionaire if you invested 1 BTC into every altcoin.
For take the 'Sapience' example. Suppose it did have enough volume for you to cash out 1000% on 1 BTC. That's 10BTC.
There are 513 other currencies. So that's 513BTC invested for a 10 BTC.
In order just to break even, one of the altcoins you invested in would need to increase in value by 51,300%., or a combination of them for that amount. This excludes any losses on other altcoins.
A simple way of verifying the reality of the matter is looking at the cumulative market cap of all altcoins. Has it gone up or down in the past year or so? Spoiler: It's dropped dramatically.

Cash is king
Source: US Dollar
Remember folks, these apocalyptic-type conspiratards have been heralding the fall of the dollar and the consequential collapse of the US government since the 1970s, and probably even before then. Remember silver in 2011? All the familiar names, i.e. Max Keiserberg, ZeroLogic, Bill Shill, etc. were pumping that too.

The 'Willy Report' explains with evidence why the price went up
Mark Karpeles, who fled a fraud charge in France for Japan and then bought MtGox in 2011 from Jeb Celeb, programmed internal bots to create massive 'buy' volume (we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars). We don't know exactly why he did it, but we do know that's what has happened.
Now we know the true cause behind Bitcoin's ridiculous bubbles, the onus is on you or others to demonstrate that the price will in fact go up for a different reason (since MtGox is now out of the picture). So far, I have heard no compelling arguments, and certainly not backed by evidence as the Willy Report is.

I could say the same for you. Sounds like I've touched a raw nerve. This encourages me.


So what? Dell have been accepting Bitcoin payment for ages. Newegg and others too. Yet the price has been gradually falling, and now after about 15 months it's at 20% or less of what it was before.
Note: Dell, Newegg, etc. do not actually 'accept Bitcoin', they accept fiat, from companies like Bitpay who dump your shitcoins on the exchanges for actual money, which they then hand over to the companies who just saw a lucrative free advertising opportunity. If you believe otherwise, name me one household name company that accepts Bitcoin itself, and not fiat from a payment processor.

It is a factual interpretation however. The money you gained didn't fall out of the sky. You can call it 'profit' or 'theft' as I choose to call it; the fact of the matter is that the money came from other Bitcoin traders/'investors' and you didn't do anything beneficial for humanity or requiring great effort to get it from them.
Before NXT had a market cap of $80 mil USD, now it has less than $20 mil. Not big moves up for many months. I fail to see how it has 'risen over 1000% in the last few weeks.'
As they say, 'Nxt.'
Has a market cap of $220,404, so no way you could make any substantial amount of money out of that. If you tried to cash out $10,000, the price would probably have the ass drop out of it before you got to $500 - as is what's happening now, as it has dropped 30% in value over the past 24 hours with only a volume of $5,574.
