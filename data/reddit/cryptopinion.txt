Thanks. I was just looking through that myself after you mentioned a RPC that spits out JSON.
So, it looks like you install and run the eclair package, set a password for the API and open it up, then you can consume that API with Javascript. Does that sound about right?
I assume the Eclair API would provide callbacks to an API endpoint that I have set up?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:28:19
I could build that.
edit: I would build it with NodeJS -- probably with Bittrex because they have a npm package.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:52:45
Good deal. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:21:53
Thanks. I've been looking for something like this.

Awesome. Would you mind explaining that a bit?

I'm not aware of a service that allows you to do what you want. Unless you would like to pay someone to code something for you, or maybe wait until a service is available, I'm afraid coding is the only way.
Coding is hard at first, but it gets much, much easier as you go. NodeJS is a great place to start, and once you get going, I think you'll find it's easy to do what you want.
To answer your questions:
1) I use VSCode. I have used several programs (generally called IDEs) to write code, and VSCode is my favorite: 
2) All you need is NodeJS. You can write a script (basically just a .js file that does what you want), and just run that script. Super easy once you get started.
All of this is free.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:40:10
Yes, that's definitely possible with NodeJS as long as Gemini and Quoinex have APIs that allow you do what you want.
I imagine Gemini would have an API for that sort of functionality. I've never heard of Quoinex.
You might want to take a look at some YouTube videos about consuming REST APIs with NodeJS. This might be a good start: 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:49:25
NodeJS is great. You can use it write a bot in Javascript that uses whatever REST API you like.
You can download NodeJS here: 
Once you install NodeJS, you will also have npm, which allows you to install packages that run on NodeJS.
For example, here's an npm package for Bittrex:  
A YouTube channel called thenewboston has a lot of tutorials about NodeJS and npm. You could just search for nodejs or npm -- something like that. Here's the channel:

I used Bitpay for my company for about three years.
Bitpay is garbage. I dropped them last month.
Their support is non-existent. In my opinion, most, if not all, third party merchant services will be replaced by lightning network.
I'm currently not accepting Bitcoin payments at all until Lightning Network is ready for primetime. At that point, I'm going to accept Bitcoin payments through Lightning Network alone.

They had fewer required confirmations for coin deposits, which was huge because I needed to get a certain amount from the trade.
The general usability of their platform was better. The trade was easier, and everything just worked better. All in all, UX was better.

They're bike parts, like rims, grips, tubes, saddles, etc. That's definitely the problem -- no one is going to pay those fees for bike parts at the relatively low price points.

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:56:47
Nope, no donation. 
In fact, one of my websites is heavily integrated with Coinbase. The fewer people who use Coinbase, probably the fewer people who will use my site -- at least in the short- to mid-term until a Coinbase replacement is integrated.
I don't care, though. I think Coinbase's actions have proven they are bad for the long-term prosperity of all crypto. I would sacrifice the success of my website that I've spent thousands of hours building if it means long-term stability of crypto.
Gemini is better from top to bottom.

I like this guide a lot: [
It's for a Raspberry Pi, but you may find it helpful anyway. I took a lot of pointers from the guide for my node that's not on a Raspberry Pi.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:56:51
What do you mean they will find a way?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:38:33
That's kind of what I'm thinking. How would you separate users from miners? How would users decide who to block and who to allow? What is a "user" in this context?
Too many problems.
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:37:50
I gotcha.
tldr: Run BTCPay server and a Lightning Network node to accept payments.  
It sounds like you're starting from scratch, so if possible, I would avoid third\-party services entirely. Examples of some third\-party services would include Bitpay, Coinbase Commerce, Coinpayments, etc.
In my opinion, one of the greatest benefits of crypto is the freedom it affords. Working with third parties would offer convenience for you, but it would also put you under their thumb.
A solution like BTCPay Server would give you freedom and control over your own funds. [
BTCPay server can be implemented such that you would not need to be notified of incoming transactions, etc.  There are some technical details that may be too detailed to get into at the moment, but basically your site would wait for a certain number of confirmations for a transaction before allowing a user to download what he or she bought.
Another great implementation would be integration of Lightning Network payments. With Lightning, transactions are truly instant, and the checkout process would be more seamless than fiat. I know because I accept Lightning payments for one of my services, and I plan to accept Lightning payments for my other services as well. It's great.
Third\-party services are much easier to set up, though. That's an option as well. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:53:08
You have several options. Are you looking for a quick implementation, or are you willing to work a bit harder for more flexibility?
I could give you some pointers depending on how much time you're willing to invest.

You are taxed on realized gains or losses. If you don't sell -- i.e. you just hodl -- you don't have any realized gains or losses. These are called unrealized gains/losses.

I'm working on a better solution to that issue. It should be out in the next hour or so.
The initial release a few hours ago allowed people to vote as many times as they wanted. I thought it would be neat for people to vote a bunch of times (if they wanted to vote multiple times) for crypto-friendly or -unfriendly. I thought it would show passion one way or the other.
Turns out that was abused almost immediately with at least one person voting several thousand times. I should have known that would happen! That person's votes have been removed.
It will still be possible to vote multiple times, but it will be a much more tamed version.

Antminer S9s use about 1,300 Watts of power (I think).
Power that runs through Antminers -- and GPU miners as well -- turns into heat. You can measure that heat by converting Watts to BTU.
1,300 Watts converts to about 4,400 BTU/hr. Your typical household space heater runs 1,500 Watts. So, an Antminer and a household space heater are almost equivalent in terms of heat production.

The best BTC payment processing API is the one you haven't built yet.

It sounds like we're trying to do similar things. I found a DDOS Protected IP available at Torguard. I'm thinking it might be good to run a Bitcoin node behind a Torguard VPN with a DDOS Protected IP. Given the recent DDOS attacks on the Lightning Network, it may be a good defense.
I'm not sure if a DDOS Protected IP would interfere with Lightning Network operation, though.
