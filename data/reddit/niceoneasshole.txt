Any portion of a coin will help stimulate the economy! That's my rationale.

Thanks!

Look into butteflylabs.com, I'll probably end up buying an asic rig after working my ass off all summer.

I think bitcointipbot may be down actually!

Thanks! It feels great to be part of this growing economy.

This is exactly how a good exchange should be formed.

I hope so too. This subreddit seems to be a great place for advice, I've been following it pretty closely the past two weeks.

Pool mining can be viable depending on your hardware. AMD GPU's perform the best vs. Nvidia's currently. Look into litecoin mining as it's currently better to mine litecoins then convert to btc's. 
I only have a laptop so mining is out of the question for me so I have to resort to good ol' fashioned investing. I'd suggest for you to try to invest now while it's still in the early phase.

Our future kids could be buying things with Satoshis. That's an insane thought.

I've been trying to buy for a couple days. Everytime I try, coinbase always hits their daily buy limit. Is there a better place to buy? I've heard bad things about mtgox on here.

Mind posting the script?

like said, asic rigs will become the norm soon and gpu mining will be outdated. At that point, gaming rigs will be completely separate from asic rigs. 
Who knows what the market will be like come December. Hopefully BTC is still growing extensively at that point!
