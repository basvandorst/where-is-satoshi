I'd just like to use blockchain tech to buy everything from groceries to cars without the merchant  having to pay credit card fees.  If visa can't shut down crypto they will go the way of Polaroid if they don't release their own blockchain transactions with lower fees.

Unless the purpose is a stable cryptocurrency that leads to wide adoption and usurps the credit card companies.  Lowering transaction fees for billions of people is a worthwhile goal.
Now what is your purpose when you use bitcoin?  I think for most people the purpose is to ride a pump and dump and hope it makes them wealthy. If they cared about the currency out-competing others they would find a way such as mine to stabilize it.  Now if that means centralized service, you could live with that because the currency would become more widely adopted and useful.  
I guess you didn't tell me what the pupose of bitcoin was?  I thought you wanted mass adoption?  I want lower transaction fees

You are still ignoring that a government that has a surplus can loan out USD and make money, this means free roads instead of roads that cost extra money after figuring in interest.
And the inflation rate doesn't really affect whether or not the government ends up paying interest on loans.  A government that doesn't pay interest on loans is objectively running at a more efficient level than one that does pay interest on loans.  Unless you are a bank or investor who gets paid by the government for buying their debt, then you probably are happy that the government is running less efficiently.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:06:14
Debt makes the government less efficient.  Everyone on this sub is complaining they have to pay taxes that support things like roads, schools, non lead based water, Property rights, etc. And yet here you are defending the portion of your taxes that goes to interest payments on government debt. The fact is the government could be running at a surplus and charging other countries for interest for USD.  All we would have to do is go back to 1950s tax rates on the wealthy for a generation and we could be left with a much more efficient government that provides more services for every dollar in taxes you spend.  
Debt has no place in a successful conservative government and yet here are the republicans spending trillions on wars and corporate welfare.

If the blockchain isn't capable of being more cost effective for processing transactions, I'm not sure I'll understand the benefits for the average user in the long run.  If the average user is paying higher transaction fees than what a database credit card company or wire transfer can do then we are just transferring more wealth to the money changers.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:23:13
No, here is another example, the US has a surplus of $1000 and loans it out to another country.  They then get back $20 of interest.  Now they spend that $20 on more roads.  That's free roads for the US taxpayers.
Your example requires the government to always %100 of the time make rational investments that grow the economy.  Except air conditioning Iraq does not grow the economy as much as it costs when most of the energy to air condition Iraq is produced in the middle East.  
And even if the government did get those kind of tax based increase in returns, which they don't, you can see that running a surplus means US citizens get a portion of the roads for free  instead of having to actually pay more than the roads cost after paying back the interest on the loans for the roads.

There is no data to assume bitcoin will stabilize year by year.  Last year was very volatile. 
What manipulation are you afraid of?  I'm sure people have found ways to manipulate the price of gold but they have also found ways to manipulate the price of bitcoin! In fact, bitcoin has proven more volatile and more manipulated!  
I like the blockchain tech if it can lead to lower transaction fees than credit cards.  But for that to really help society you need a more stable currency.  Consider how much money credit card companies are skimming every year? Don't you want to lower that?  A stable crypto could make for a more efficient monetary system. 
In short, can you explain why the price of bitcoin is harder to manipulate than gold?
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:19:38
PayPal has pretty high fees, higher than credit cards for businesses. If paypal was accepted everwhere credit cards are and charged one/tenth the fees, it would be a big success. 
If blockchain tech could be implemented by a bank in a country that doesnt have excessive regulations, I don't see a problem.  The beauty of using gold as a backer is that it makes for a stable currency. The confidence in the value of your crypto would be unparalleled.  You could always sell to someone who lives near the bank and just wants to exchange for gold.

It is also a non-existent enterprise.  I'd recommend checking out "The Polka King" on netflix.  I think the lesson is that greed typically causes people to fail to think critically.  
Right now the only real demand for bitcoin is speculative demand.  Gold has actual demand and a floor of about $600 an ounce in costs to mine more gold.  There is no floor for mining bitcoin costs.  I'd love to see a cryptocurrency that isn't speculative and can be exchanged for an asset like gold.  It wouldn't have volatility swings of 1000% but it also wouldn't make some people millions of dollars in the process.  The reason bitcoin people hate that idea is because they don't want a stable cryptocurrency that has intrinsic value.  They want a get rich quick scheme that will not end well for most of the later participants.

We did it in the 50s.  The marshall plan had a lot of loans:
The UK received 385 million USD of its Marshall Plan aid in the form of loans.[97] Unconnected to the Marshall Plan the UK also received direct loans from the US amounting to 4.6 billion USD.[97] The proportion of Marshall Plan loans versus Marshall Plan grants was roughly 15% to 85% for both the UK and France.
Here is an objective fact:
A government with debt equal to revenue would have to pay about 3% interest as a percentage of revenue.  Efficiency as defined as % of payments to services / total revenue = 97%.  
A government with no debt would have efficiency of 100%.
A government with a surplus that they loan out the same amount as their revenue at a rate of 4% interest would have an efficiency of 104%.  
I'd rather have a government with 104% efficiency than 97% efficiency because that means I get more services for every dollar in taxes I pay.

If I own bitcoin what are my profit and loss statement for the bitcoin enterprise?  How much money did the bitcoin enterprise earn in 2017, what are their projections for 2018?  
Of course owning bitcoin is not like owning a company. There is no bitcoin enterprise, no profits per share.    It is at best the same as holding cash, an action I do not do to make money, but out of convenience.  Bitcoin is 100% a pyramid scheme.
You may say the blockchain has value?  Okay, so does bitcoin own a patent on the blockchain?  
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:23:45
we are in the pump phase for now.  
I find it odd that lots of bitcoin speculators are scared of the stock market because valuations could be affected by the Federal Reserve.  Any investment, good or bad, can be affected by the wealthy that control the system, the question is for how long and how much?  
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:29:23
An enterprise in the investments world means a business or company.  I think we both know bitcoin is not a business or company.  This is why you can't tell me what the dividend or quarterly profits are.  So yes, bitcoin as an investment is a non existent enterprise.  
I think cryptos could be stable if they weren't set up by people that want to run pump and dumps.  Let's say a bank let's anyone buy a crypto called goldcoin, where 1 goldcoin can be exchanged for on oz of gold.  If you buy goldcoin they store the gold for you.  At any point you can sell your goldcoin to someone else for free.  The buyer of the coin pays say 1/10 a percent transaction fee, much lower than credit cards charging 10 to 20 times that. 
Now in this case goldcoin would be about as stable as the price of gold.  I'm sure you are aware that gold is more stable and less volatile than bitcoin.  Do you think gold has halved in value in january like bitcoin did?  I'll bet you without looking that gold has been a lot more stable over the last decade than bitcoin?  Will you take that bet?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:05:52
a price crash would lower the power needed right? No one is going to spend all that money to mine if bitcoin goes down to $1.  Other than that though the amount of coin mine able is going down so ultimately the only way power use keeps going up would be if the price kept going up faster than the % of coin mine-able goes down?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:29:01


Well we had lower debt ratios in the 50s than now and higher growth rates. A healthy government encourages more investment by businesses who less fear further tax rate increases.  For instance if you know taxes are more likely to go up than down you engage in profit taking not investment in growth.

"I was lucky enough to have used bitcoin around 2012 - 2014 and I saw what it was capable of: near instant transfers anywhere in the globe that cost a fraction of a penny."
So why was the blockchain running cheaper fees than credit card or wire transfers then?  Isn't it possible a somewhat centralized gold backed crypto could replicate these low fees?  Eventually banks are going to be using some of the tech and are already working on it

Okay, I will just be the only one of the two of us to understand why Germany has cheaper MRI's than America.  You keep living you buddy.  Learning is tough for a lot of people.  Don't feel bad.
Edit: I felt bad that you were not going to learn anything here.  Here is a link: 
“Other countries negotiate very aggressively with the providers and set rates that are much lower than we do,” Anderson says. They do this in one of two ways. "In countries such as Canada and Britain, prices are set by the government. In others, such as Germany and Japan, they’re set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement, with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail."
Again if you are happy to overpay I think we can be friends.  I'm happy to overcharge you for any services you require.  You seem happy to pay more than the average for healthcare (because capitalism!!!) so I'm sure we can come to an agreement.  What overpriced goods and services besides healthcare may I assist you with acquiring today?
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:33:25
Well lots of stocks pay dividends.  If you short a stock you have to pay out the dividends while you wait for it to go down.  Meanwhile the majority of companies make more money than they lose and are on paper worth more as they expand in size and can pay even more in dividends.  
It is basically impossible to compare dividend earning stocks to bitcoin.  Bitcoin is most like owning a rare coin collection.  I'd say art, but people pay good money to see famous art.  You could probably open a museum and make money off your rare coin collection too but to a lesser extent.  
 
Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency.  A good one with fast transactions, ease of use, security, and low fees.  Until that happens I'm skeptical of its utility.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:57:29
why are people still paying those Bitcoin fees, even when they get so high? 
Because they think bitcoin will keep going up by more than the fees or they think it will go down by more than the fees?  
I'm assuming most transactions now are not bases on using bitcoin as a currency but rather as a stock?  If that is the assumption that bitcoin is predominantly a stock, than what guarantees do I have?  Will it issue dividends that make it impossible to short?  Does it have underlying value due to assets that could be sold off in a bankruptcy?  No.  Does it make a steady cash flow from a business that is hard to replicate?  Sort of, there are profits from transaction fees similar to Visa.  But as an owner of bitcoin I don't get any of the profit from transaction fees.
As a stock where does bitcoin have value similar to other stocks?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:46:45
If crypto is better than wire transfers, the banks will just make their own blockchains.  At no point will bitcoin take down fiat.  A deflationary currency is terrible for economic growth.  What we are seeing is 95% speculation.  Honestly given all the tax cuts corporations are getting in 2018 I'd rather hold dividend stocks for the first half of the year than bitcoin. We are going to see shareholders getting paid at the expense of long term growth. But then again putting 100 USD a month into bitcoin is ok gambling.

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:46:30
too much capitalism generated a lack of competition.  the government needs to impose the same regulations they have in Germany to increase competition.  In most American cities, individuals or their employer only has 1 or 2 choices for health insurance. This is because the barrier to entry is too great due to having to negotiate special pricing with hundreds or thousands of healthcare providers in that city/state.   A simple pricing law that removed the need to negotiate would dramatically increase competition

I'm assuming right now miners are spending close to 15K to extract bitcoin?  How low could that cost go if bitcoin crashes?  I mean actual gold costs at least 600 an ounce to obtain. And if inflation occurs, the cost to mine gold tends to go up with inflation.  So 100 years from now it will probably cost at least 6000 dollars to mine an ounce of gold.   But in theory if bitcoin crashed back down to .05 dollars, you could still mine it at cost once the algorithm readjusts. I just don't think bitcoin has a floor.  But then a rare penny has a floor of .01 dollars but can be sold for thousands of times that.  I'm tired of people comparing it to gold when it is more like art or coin collections at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:14:31
what is your position as to why Germany has lower healthcare costs, specifically in this case, MRI prices, than America?  I have given you the reason, which is they have more competition and have price controls that protect the consumer through increasing competition in the insurance market.  
But again if you would like to wager I would be happy to?  America has less regulations and more capitalism in healthcare than in Europe.  Do you disagree?  I assume you agree, so we will bet on the average price of an MRI in America versus any European country?  You pay me the price of an American MRI and I will pay you the price of any more government involved European MRI?  This is a fair bet for you since you think capitalism can't possibly do worse than government regulation.  Why won't you take this bet?  You must think Europe has more capitalism in healthcare than America?

Couldn't any country just target exchanges 1 by 1 and pressure banks and credit card companies to not accept transactions to those exchanges.  I mean, credit card companies don't need to be told twice to target competitors, and most banks are basically 100% dependent on government loans.
