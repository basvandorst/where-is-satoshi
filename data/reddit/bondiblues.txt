SegWit not supported for external wallet withdrawal.  Frustrating.

Over at the World Crypto Network, Thomas has created Bitcoin Flyers which are available to download and print. They give some essential info about Bitcoin and could help raise awareness.

This attempt to create 0.1 bitcoin should be part of a test suite and ran before every single release.

Worst case scenario is that the masses will remain eternally fooled by the mainstream media and will never learn about the power of bitcoin and its ability to transform their lives. sound money, censorship resistant money, being your own bank etc..
It pains me when people who haven't a clue about bitcoin just repeat negative articles they've read. The world not knowing there is more to Bitcoin than price swings , that's the worst case scenario
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:42:09
Still can't believe the automated test suite didn't check for something like this.

Does anyone think that, ultimately, even monthly salary payments like this will end up being performed over lightening?

Shameful. I feel I've watched that crap a million times. Negative spin, trying to slow the tide, keeping the masses ignorant of the transition taking place. 
All we can do is continue to teach the people ourselves, one at a time, and keep buying Bitcoin.

3 building collapsing at near free fall speed along the path of highest resistance, symmetrically, on the same day, with rocks exploding and fizzling into dust in mid air. NIST need to go back to basics and learn the laws of energy conservation before trying to figure out how pow blockchain works.

Yip that's it. Automated tests are a good way to check for backward compatibility too.  But look, its easier said than done. I've written tests which still allowed bugs to get through because I didn't imagine a particular scenario in the first place.  Its not easy. But, maybe this will put the focus on those standard tests, which is a good thing.

The advantage is that you provide Bitwage with just an address you generate, possibly on a hardware wallet, so it's an on chain transaction where you control the private key at all times.
Your keys, your Bitcoin as the saying goes..
You do however have to send your salary to Bitwage first, then they forward say 80% to your bank account and the remaining 20% goes to buying Bitcoin. You can adjust those percentages of course. The batch transaction is also eco-friendly
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:37:16
Say "It's to buy Bitcoin, as much as I can".

I'm buying. Even if you already have a lot, you should keep pushing and buy up more. Make it harder for the rich to get in. You only have one chance at this.

If this is the case, then it is bad for bitcoin in my opinion, even if they are pool's. No point cheering for higher and higher hash rates if its centralised hash in one geographic region. Centralised hash means we are converging towards bitcoin cash in that aspect, and that sucks. For the past 10 years, we've been talking about how important distribution in hash rate is, so we shouldn't downplay such a scenario. Economies of scale is always pushing us towards more centralisation in hash, we can't fight the trend if we keep responding with jokes. 
If one region holds most of the hash it's easier to disrupt bitcoin. We don't want any double spends or credibility gets eroded.
I don't think the mining toasters are going to help us on this one.

Above I said "disrupt bitcoin" not stop bitcoin. Maybe you didn't understand the point I was making. It goes without saying that bitcoin would continue

It only take a few hacked addresses together with a big media campaign to shake confidence and plant the seed of doubt in the general publics mind.
Imagine an "expert" on CNN saying " yes the people in bitcoin underestimated the effectiveness of brute force attacks", that's why we in the banking sector use multiple mechanisms to keep your funds safe...
Then they get a few more average joes saying "oh i moved my money out of bitcoin because my friends address was hacked", and so on..
The people who want to stop bitcoin won't do it with a 51% attack, they will do it by promoting these stories and making exaggerations. Propaganda

Batching is just an efficient way to send to many. With batching maybe only one new change address is created for the sender, whereas with multiple individual transactions wallets may create a new utxo for each. So with batching, less dust is created.

"Stiff willies" was another odd phrase I heard Craig say.
And his email signoff is unrivalled
"I AM Satoshi. Fuck off, Craig"

He really is playing the villan role well. All this trash talk. He's the Chael Sonnen of crypto!
Unlike Chael he won't be able to back it up I think.
I wonder if a drawn out hash war in Bcash will encourage big Gov to spend resources on trying to disrupt Bitcoin.

I called Bank of Ireland helpdesk and got authenticated, answering password and secret questions etc, finally they asked "How can we help you today"? I said, "great, I would like to close my account". To which they responded "sorry we can't do that, you need to go to the office in person or write a letter". What a joke

I think a lot of people in the AI world were surprised when AlphaGo arrived, many imagined it was a decade off. Now Quantum computing is far more difficult,no doubt about that, but let's not rest on our lorels. One thing is for sure, the funding going into AI is growing, it's like a new arms race, so it's really hard to predict a time line. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:36:24
Exactly. Just wait for it...once it pumps again the phone will start hopping. It's actually easy to make money in bitcoin when you are competing with the 80% and got a strong hand

I feel Craig has a mental illness, which will only become more aggravated with a Roger Ver fued. The way he writes and speaks when upset, to me indicates paranoia and dillusion. He is very unstable. 
I remember seeing an old video of him being interviewed by a female journalist and he was very relaxed and civil, speaking home truths about bitcoin everyone could nod along with, very pleasant. But that exterior hides a turbulent mind underneath, one trigger and ka-boom. Different person.
