Maybe that's when it all started
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:00:13
Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:36:21
What about when the company that makes this hardware storage device decides to make it stop working or become slow when you need it? Maybe they're security is so bad if you just plug it to the the computer, you can connect to it from anywhere with a simple virus/hack? 
Paper is the safest

New coins might not be mined after that limit but miners will be needed for transactions of existing coin. Not a problem, there's no shortage of them because anyone can be a miner.
People with a lot of real money do try to control the world, but we formed groups call countries to protect our wishes. we still have to be controlled but by our own chosen people like the king and his family or man his advisor which we vote on what tell what the man to do. In the digital world, this is not possible so easily currently.

Are you saying that when btc crashes, the complexity will go down? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:08:14
You're saying we already have this with money at the moment, because few people own all the money already.

What's the default? 
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:18:15
The the 4 digit years come from the citations at the end of the whitepaper

It's the war of tour times 
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:41:16
It's still 	1.00152936 BTC
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:27:51
This would be great 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:28:00
What do you use to bruteforce? I have a list of 12 suspected words
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:10:25
That's not a lot for a computer program
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:41:26
I give up

It wouldn't be good PR for OP's company 
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:47:43
OP said 1btc is hiding in *plain* sight and there is a cross on the word lost. Lost was a TV show about a plane that crashed. Plane sight is not bip39 but *plain* and *see* is. *See* could be a reference to the sea that the island was surrounded with. BRB I'm going to rewatching Lost for clues Il keep you updated over the next couple of days

Tell that to people who bought in December 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:47:32
Probably since even grandparents are asking about how to buy bitcoin now
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:44:27
No one cares though
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:14:39
Can it crash if there's actually a shortage? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:44
I don't think that will happen. governments hate bitcoin. You have kids becoming millionaires and the government of their country has no idea and can't ever find out. I think government worldwide will start to crack down on crypto making it illegal to accept bitcoin. Coinbase might become like paedophilia website
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:42:24
when has it happened before? looking at the chart for the last 5 years it's never spiked like this
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:55:16
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:01:54
Is there an explanation of what happened exactly? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:16:44
What I don't get is how someone can patent the idea of trying to find the identity of a person making a cryptocurrency transaction. Can I patent Googling to find the best pizza places based on reviews from various sites?

The hypocrisy here is staggering. Amazon one of the biggest tax avoiders in the world is trying to charge the government for a services that helps track down tax avoiders. The government can collect much more tax by not using amazon's services and instead making amazon pay the tax it owes
