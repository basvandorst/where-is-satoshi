The point was that bitcoin can’t leave the blockchain. Even lost bitcoin are still on the blockchain. Your  first answer while technically correct was needless as coins can not be taken off the blockchain and thus what was obviously being referenced were the keys and the best/most secure way to manage them.

If you use it as a currency I don’t see how you would pay taxes on it because you are never selling it for capital gains. You would pay sales tax but no capital gains. Again this assumes you use it as a currency, and not an investment to sell back into fiat.

Lol charity. Hey everyone don’t worry about the pillars of society let’s leave it to the generosity and humanitarian efforts of human nature, and an ideology that rewards greed and punishes anything less. Sounds like a great plan there guy.

The left states subsidize the red states. But facts never matter to the right.

Lol wow dude. You are so delusional. You wouldn’t last 1 fucking day in the world you propose. There is no responding to that much stupid.

What in the ever loving fuck does that have to do with the necessity of taxes to provide public services that serve as the backbone of a functioning society. There is nothing wrong with making money. The problem are greedy fucks who are so shortsighted they literally are unable to see past their own personal bubble. You wanna privatize schools guess what now you have a huge population that goes uneducated how do they make money? Crime in all likelihood. How many customers are you going to have when no one can get to your store because it costs 20$ just to take the road there. Just think critically for two seconds and maybe you’d see how stupid your post is.

This is fucking stupid. The left doesn’t want to make the poor rich and the rich poor. They want people to have health care so they don’t go bankrupt and die. They want people to have jobs that pay fair wages so they can afford to buy things and grow the economy like was standard in the 60s. And they want rich people to pay their fair share of taxes because they’ve been paying for loopholes and storing off shores instead of putting some money back into the country that made them rich. So take your thought experiment back to the toilet where you thought of it.

Yeah actually. It’s called government. You see them in every single civilized country that’s ever existed. Jesus how fucking dense are you.

Bitcoin I think, will be the foundation all other cryptos sit on much like gold. It won’t be a currency but a store of value. But who knows.

Yeah. Like the roads you drive on. The police that keep your neighborhood safe. The school that taught you to read and write your stupid comment.
