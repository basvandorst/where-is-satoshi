The dotcom bubble peaked at around $3,000,000,000,000, was largely funded through private banks, and offered virtually no tangible utility. Bitcoin's current market cap is only $250,000,000,000 (1/12 that of dotcom peak valuation) has no private funding through banks, and offers endless utility. Even if this was all a speculative bubble doomed to pop, it won't be happening until at least 5 times the dotcom bubble peak in terms of total crypto-sphere market cap.  
  
We'll talk at $180,000 Bitcoins.

I mentioned that in my last sentence of the first paragraph, but I agree. The global market cap is around $750,000,000,000, which is 1/4 the dotcom peak. A respectable portion of that valuation will diminish as shitcoin speculation/pump-and-dumps lose their appeal over time. And again, we have tangible utility, financed exclusively through self-funding, and competition scarcity to the extent experienced through domain leasing isn't even on our radar.

The price isn't unimportant in that it's a reflection of the significance of the technology and its underlying trustless function as a means of decentralized exchange. This technology is world changing. We ain't seen nothing yet.

Clearly there is a disconnect between our perspectives of what Bitcoin is.

It's not intuitive? Neither is stock trading, forex, or virtually any aspect of the finance sector.

Making this nonsensical point over and over again like every butthurt leftist does everytime Trump's victory is brought up is evidence the left is populated by joyless sore losers.
