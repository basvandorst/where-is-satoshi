Voat takes forever to load and until that gets resolved it will not be better
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:26:13
As opposed to fiat which can easily be used for the same thing...

What the hell are you complaining about? That's barely worth a penny and the network isn't going to sustain itself for free

You press Win + Pause/Break. It will say "Windows 8.1" or "Windows 8" in the system info window.

I don't trust online Bitcoin/Altcoin storage solutions to begin with.

ABP+ Helps with getting rid of this shit
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:49:19
Let me guess, people are here
edit: yes, yes they are, thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:06:40
Well then, I'm not really sure where to go, the only two closest banks in my area are TD and BofA
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:04:08
Consumers don't pay credit card fees but you know who does? The businesses that accept them.
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:20:49
Wow for real? I think a lawsuit would be in order just to show the the irony of the pants on the head retarded 0 tolerance policy. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:07:21
ok it seems I'm just wasting my time with a troll 
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:35:03


Speaking of butts, yours is probably hurt big time
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:15:11
I usually use PayPal as a buffer, and send what I will spend later into my bank and/or spend any money that I need at the given moment. Never really see Paypal as a good way to store money for the longterm.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:10:47
I can smell the fear off the bankers all the way from here
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:59:35
The FUDers will sure as hell not convince me of anything, just a good opportunity to buy some or more if you had some already.
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:14:09
I really am not getting your beef with Windows.
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:03:57
You know what's also coded in C++? Malware and Trojans
@_date: 2014-07-05 12:46:57
Windows 8 or 8.1?
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:00:42
Will they just fucking quit it? It isn't going to work, deal with it China!
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:21:42
Well good, that means I can stock up on some then
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:04:47
Yeah, it's more like "Withdraw your coins now or we'll take them for ourselves during the maintenance period"
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:23:25
It will flop, because it'll just be the same problematic bullshit that the traditional bank system has, but in a different form
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:24:00
"Stay away from things that threaten my fortune"
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:23:06
This is a great opportunity for those who want to buy some.
Hodl on to your butts
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:32:42
Yep, I just realized what I typed, damn that was stupid
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:17:02
Nice phishing scam you got there, now go the fuck away
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:42:17
Are Dell Latitudes really that bad?
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:34:40
More like Ben Smalldicksky

Apparently, Google is a dick
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:10:16
and frontpage are two different things, you've been on reddit for 3 years and should know that.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:23:20
Good thing I never gave UPS my details
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:38:41
There's no way it would fail anyway, have you looked around at the amount of Bitcoin adoption that is taking place?
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:09:09
Don't chuck it if you haven't tried it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:05:37
Then why the fuck are you here?
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:11:41
Since when? When some random people who joined in on Bitcoin decided that's what it was for?
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:07:33
You could probably get Windows 8.1 on one of those with no problem
edit: I'm really not understanding some peoples' freetard attitude, I really am not.
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:45:37
512GB of ram?
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:55:06
Were they ever?
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:27:05
True, but I don't always jump on lawsuits as the answer to problems, it's just in this situation where the school is hindering the kid's education because they didn't like what he was talking about because they got their news about it from a news source that talked negatively about it, and took that in as the only true information about it is just infuriating.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:38:54
No it doesn't you fucking idiot.
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:54:48
 I've had no issue with BofA and coinbase except for that time Coinbase charged me $0.00 when they shouldn't have when I was trying to activate a card that wasn't supported, it did take me all of 5 minutes to fix the problem with the bank though.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:39:35
You have no idea what I'm referring to, do you 
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:46:33
I just use coinbase as means of buying BTC with fiat, not as an online bank. I'm my own bank in that respect with a BTC client running on my own machine.
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:44:48
Yeah, the hacker voiced an opinion alright, a fucking racist one
@_date: 2014-08-21 23:14:57
If anything happens to your Bitcoins, you only have yourself to blame
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:36:05
If you can even compile and develop C++ you're far from a dumbass
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:35:31
They only language they understand is money, not common sense
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:38:38
Good fucking luck buddy, this shit won't work.

No shit?

The U.S. would be a mess by now if that were true, it went through at least 2 and it ended up fine
@_date: 2014-10-14 23:08:24
I'm confused about the Super Nintendo part
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:10:49
The only info I gave them so far is my email and my bank acc. number so I can buy BTC. They haven't asked me for more as of yet. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:17:37
Good thing I closed my account with them a few days ago and went with Circle instead.

Rip in pennies
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:42:26
No such thing as bad publicity is damn right, there's a chance someone might still try something out regardless if it's put in a bad light or not
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:08:15
The front page only shows you what you're subscribed to, so then why the fuck are you subscribed to this sub?

They used PayPal, but some immature assholes from this site that actively try to stop Voat from existing got Voat's PayPal canned

Wouldn't be surpised if they are somehow running machines with Motorola 68k's in them

What are they going to tax next? Walking in the front door of your own house?
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:46:48
And some 6502s just in case

Not possible, the wallet file is merely an access key to your wallet funds that are stored on the blockchain, the thing that keeps the bitcoin transactions going. Only those who have the wallet have control over what they do with said funds.

Like I've been saying for the past year, it's not Cryptsy, it's Craptsy
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:54:01
Some don't even allow opting out, because that means the school's funding gets cut
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:07:30
They shouldn't even be talking shit when their own currency is tanking

No circlejerking against CLI please
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:37:23
Why is anyone giving them business after what happened 3 years ago anyway?
