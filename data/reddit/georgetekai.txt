Josh Is an asshole and he keeps deleting posts...If you have nothing to hide why block the posts...I also heard that they mine 24hrs at least with the equip...they must have a stock pile of Bitcoins from using your stuff...Why is it necessary to mine with all product....Radio companies dont do burn in tests..neither do ipads and laptops...Clearly this company is built on double talk and scams....the owner and employees have a bad reputation.. One guy even went to prison for mail fraud

Seems to me by this letter they may be headed to insolvancy.
If they file for bankruptcy they are not required to pay back their creditors.....Seems like they did  a smash and grab.
1.  They are slow to get parts and workers.
2.  They won't refund.
3.  Josh has said they spent the money on next project.
4.  They seem to be mining longer since the difficulty is up they are making less for parts so they can't release money makers until they made more coin.
5.  The consistent denial that anything is wrong.
6.  The biggest proof is all the pissed off people.
7.  Something must be going on when you are over a year behind on your orders.
8.  Josh spends more time trolling rather then building.
9.  People are complaining about being scammed out of upgrade balance.
10.. They are sending out product with missing power supply and broken fans....
11... Put your own problem here...
Fuck Butterfly Labs ...
Dont drink the kool aid

If you look at the amount of stuff that shipped yesterday on BFL Blog. It was the biggest shipping jump to date.
If you look at the netework hash rate....It went from 982 to 828 Terrahash drop... They were mining with this shit all along..This will no doubt jump up as people will receive them in the mail..
This goes to show that people were right. If you had a money making machine why wouldn't you use it rather then Sell it...
WELL THEY HAVE BEEN USING IT THEN MAILING IT..THEY GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS..FUCKERS HAD THE SHIT ALL ALONG..THEY WERE MINING UNTIL THE NETWORK WAS FULL THEN THEY SELL IT ..WIN WIN FOR BFL....FUCK YOU BFL COMPANY FULL OF LIES AND SCAMS.....
