Ledger is NOT open source. It has a closed source blob. No one knows what it does. It could install a virus, dump your keys, etc. No one knows. I would not wish it on my worst enemy.

I see no problem with it. A fixed number of coins per block (declining perpetual inflation) is a much better security model than requiring volatile fees. It is also paid by the whole network, which is who benefits from security. Not just people who transact benefit from security and they are the only ones who currently will be paying for it.

Bitcoin is seriously sick. The community is split. The blockspace is full. There is no realistic scaling that will be complete within the next 1-2 years. There is serious risk of contentious hardfork.
My guess is we will see definitely see $500 again.

Not at all. If in 30 years fees do not cover inflation, then a hardfork to give a constant reward to miners can be implemented. Problem solved.

The difference is bitcoin is completely new. A bureaucrat gets no blame for approving standard products that are regulated such as an ETF of stocks. It took the SEC 4 years before it approved gold. That is something with thousands of years of history.

No, because the ETF is their plan to get out of bitcoin. They haven't done all this work for the 0.05% ETF admin fee.

China news sparked withdrawals. Problem is, BTCC does not have the bitcoin that people want to withdraw. So, they are delaying hoping the bank run will die down.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:27:28
Excatly. There is 0% chance of it getting approved. The actual scary thing will be that these coins will be sold on exchanges once it gets denied. That is hundreds of thousands of coins. Obviously the owners of the coins do not intend to hold them long-term (otherwise they would not be selling them via the ETF proposal), so if it gets denied that is going to be a shit ton of coins for sell on bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:23:51
Game theory: The bureaucrat gains nothing by approving it. If they do approve it, and it gets hacked and investors lose money, then they get the blame.
There really is nothing in it for the decision maker. Based on the fact that more shorts are taken out on BTC than at any other time compared to longs, then it means big players are looking to profit on it being declined:

Why do you think Stein will vote yes? There is no evidence she is pro-bitcoin. I have seen she is pro-blockchain as a way for government to be more transparent, but not really pro-bitcoin.
Quite contrary, due to being only 2 commissioners, they would feel more pressure to take the conservative approach and vote no. That way a vote can be deferred on an ETF when there is a full commission.

I don't know the exact fee, but it is going to be low. Much lower than 2%, which is the fee of GBTC which is already market traded and has over 100 million of bitcoin under control.
My guess is that it is 0.5 and 1%. So, you are talking a million in revenue maximum for every 100 million under management.
Keep in mind, GBTC has been available for years and is also purchaseable in retirement accounts. So far, there is not a billion dollars worth of interest in it. So, the ETF and every additional product that gets approved, will just split investment money between more and more funds.
So, don't expect the ETF to have huge money under management.

If one man can currently attack bitcoin don't you think state actors can already attack bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:58:42
Agreed. imagine if some pools coordinated this. Let's say 50% of pools are coordinating this attack. Given that they will mine the blocks 50% of the time, the fee cost to them is only 50% compared to a normal attacker.
Now, let's say they are spending 600/hr attacking the network. Since they will mine half the fees, that reduces the cost to 300/hr.
So, if legitimate transactions increase their fees such that it is &gt; 300 /hr, then the pools / miners profit.

This is closed-source. The closed source binary could be doing anything -- installing a virus, dumping your keys, you have no idea!
So, if you want to store bitcoins, its the worst solution possible. You might as well just keep it unencrypted on your computer.

You do know the numbers are just examples right? It could be any arbitrary number of miners
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:28:34
No, but it is the most profitable. Other attacks would destroy confidence in bitcoin and are easy to recognize,so it would destroy value of the very coins they mine.
This attack is more benign. It is harder to discover and does not destroy coin value. Simply makes a fee market higher

One thing to remember is the ledger is **closed source**. That means they can put a back door in there to dump your keys. No one can verify it. Some parts of the code is open source, but there is a blackbox, closed source portion of the code that no one knows what it does. So, as they say, **buyer beware**
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:31:12
I am getting the Trez0r. As the first (and most reviewed) wallet it has history and trust and the most compatability with external services. The same core code is used by two separate companies (keepkee an satoshilabs) and as a result they both have incentive to keep it clean and review each others code (as finding mistakes can destroy their main competitor).
Trez0r is 100% open source and includes cool features like using a separate passphrase for deniability (so you can have multiple wallets with the same seed all using different passphrases).
The Ledger Nano S has a bit better form factor and is cheaper. But the benefits of the trez0r and its better screen (versus nano S) is worth it, IMO
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:33:30


Based on your replies to this thread, I would say that "dancing around it" is not completely false. Listen, your product has a big negative and that is its closed source nature. It also has positives like its form factor and good developer momentum.
It's up for people to decide whether being closed source and potentially vulnerable to exploit and hackers is worth the positives. Don't try to minimize the downside of being closed source to the end-user.
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:03:33
You should probably get a keepkey or a trezor. The Ledger is not open source. It contains a binary firmware that no one knows what it does. For all anyone knows it has secret commands on it that dump your keys.
An open source, verifiable hardware wallet is lot smarter. Putting money on a ledger is like putting money on an exchange -- trusting a 3rd party to hold your coins.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:11:33
**Beware of Ledger products** They are NOT open source. There is a blackbox of proprietary, closed, unaudited code in each device. No one knows what it does. It could very well contain secret commands to dump your private key (even Ledger itself admits this).
Trezor is much safer and auditable. All the code is open source. Auditable and verifiable. Even the bootloader, which is responsible for ensuring you are running signed and correct code, can be dumped and compared to the open source code. 
Bitcoin is about **Don't trust, verify**. Trezor / Keepkey are far more verifiable than Ledger. Neither is perfect (after all, a backdoor could exist within the actual silicon itself), but Trezor is much more verifiable than the Ledger.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:53:11


There has not been any wrong conclusions. There are several attack vectors:
1) The silicon - this is vulnerable for both your product and trezors
2) The open source software - this can be mitigated by compiling it and verifying signatures against distributed binaries
3) The closed source software - there is not way to mitigate this. Its 100% trust base
Both yours and trez0rs product has issues with  and  However, only your product has issue with 
You are not educating at all. All you are doing is denying. I already posted your own words where you stated yourself 1 year ago it cannot be verified and this would allow you to create secret commands (or have secret bugs).
It is really that simple. Your product has the exact same issues as trez0rs with the addition of the security risk imposed by the closed source software. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:02:26
It's not too short. You only need to record the first 4 words of each recovery key.
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:18:09
I recommend to use the Trezor which has decoy wallets. The biggest threat is the $5 wrench attack (someone threatening to hit you over the head unless you give them access).
Trezor has easy to use decoy wallets, so you can give them a wrong password that shows a wallet you have a small amount of bitcoin in, so they don't know about your real stash.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:20:10
Not at all. Your security model is "security through obscurity and un-auditability". That is never secure. You have already proven ignorance and understanding of security.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:24:02


With other solutions you can verify the code running on it. Trez0r is 100% open source. Yours is not. I might have misunderstood whether or not you have the source code to the closed chip you are using, but the fact is there are parts of your code that are completely closed that cannot be verified by the end-users.


Due to the closed-source nature of your product there is no way to verify the code that is running. With other solutions such as Trez0r, you can compile it again and compare the resultant against what is distributed by Trez0r. In this way you know the binaries that are distributed match the publicly available and auditable source code.
Given that your product does not have publicly available and auditable source code there is no way to verify anything. It is a completely blackbox. And, I understand that parts of your codebase are open source, but not all. The fact is, any bugs, security issues, or backdoors can simply exist in the portion that is closed source. So, it is a huge security issue for the end user.

@_date: 2017-01-27 04:51:59
In addition, something else I need to start educating users about so they run away from your product is that your product does not support a 25th key in a user-friendly way. With other hardware wallets you can simply type in another key, which has the effect of creating unlimited wallets (and corresponding deniability).
So, even assuming your actual device was as secure as the trezor (which it is not. It is LESS secure), the limitations of your software make the actual usage of the device much less secure.
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:16:34
The ledger is pretty awesome and I have thought about it myself. The one thing you should know is **Ledger is NOT open source**. The company will try to dance around this fact using jargon and trying to minimalize it, but the fact is a core piece of the software is closed source. It is even outside of the hands of Ledger.
As a result, there are two attack vectors: 1) Ledger company gets compromised and releases backdoored code or signed backdoored binaries 2) The firmware provider of their chipset releases backdoored code or simply the firmware contains lots of bugs that we don't now about since its not opensource.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:21:15
No, your Nano S also constains closed source code. No reason to lie. From the bootloader, to firmwares, to apps. It is not 100% open source. Only giving the source code for the tip of it (the apps) doesn't make it open source. Shame on you for misleading.

That's too much. Sometimes I use satellite internet when I am doing a safari run in africa.

I think its important my satellite fed mobile node does not get dropped from the network.
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:08:49
I already did many times. You just seem too dense to understand. You can compile and audit the source code and load it on the device yourself. As far as bootloader, you can dump this and inspect it and compare it to the open source of the bootloader.
Quit shilling your closed source crap as if it is secure. Maybe you should spend less time trying to defend your closed source product and more time explaining to your customers that they **cannot** verify that you have not put in a back door that dumps their keys.

Once again, you prove yourself to be an imbecile. Requiring people to use phython to setup an alternative pin is not user friendly, as stated. If you create friction for people to implement best security practices, then less people will do it, which means less secure users. With trezor this is very easy, with a nice gui, every time they access a wallet. No need to use the command line, no need for python, and it does not have the limitations your "solution" has, which is a very poor implementation.
Lastly, this does not support unlimited wallets. Once again showing your own ignorance about your own product. This lets someone create 1 additional wallet as a "duress pin". From your own website (I recommend you read it sometime):


@_date: 2017-01-27 04:48:31
The trezor is auditable. You really don't understand security at all. I just told you that you can verify the bootloader. You can verify the chip is the open source chip. If you really want to, you can remove the physical flash storage of the bootloader and inspect the actual physical memory to get the bootloader contents and verify it against the open source code.
Your device is specifically designed to NOT be auditable. So yes, I would take a device that has more audit-ability than your device. Because the truth is no one knows what the hell your device does. It could dump keys. It could install a virus on people's host machine when plugged in. No one really knows and your effort to make it not auditable means it will be an extremely costly endeavor to attempt to find out.

Your products are not horrible. The form factor of the Nano S is probably better than the Trezor. But, your security model is just flawed. Two areas 1) you make an insecure, unauditable device 2) you make your device harder to use in a secure way which means it will be used in a less secure way by more users.
Instead of getting butt-hurt about the inferiority of your products, take the constructive criticism gracefully and improve your products.

I believe they are all open source except Ledger, which uses a non-opensource core. In regards to Trez0r, it is the oldest hardware wallet producer and its code is also used by a competitor named KeepKey, which since they used and modified the code I assume they would have destroyed Trez0r's business if there was any backdoors in it or other such things.

No, you don't need to. Most people can just read out the firmware as I already taught you how to do. Only a few people need to audit the hardware. Not every device needs to be audited to have a lower risk factor than yours. The fact that its impossible to audit every individual trezor/ ledger does not mean that they are equally auditable as a group. As a group, trezor devices are more auditable and more secure due to their auditability than your closed source virus you sell.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:31:49
Are you being intentionally obtuse here? You even say in your own post history: 


With your solution it is impossible to verify anything. There could be an untold number of bugs or backdoors or anything in it. Because its closed source. With open source solutions the only back door would have to be in the silicon itself, which could equally occur with your product.
The fact that your product is closed source only causes additional risk. So, the question is, why assume additional risk? Bitcoin is all about don't trust but verify. It's impossible to verify your product. Other products are more verifiable.

Any issues with this approach also exist with your device. Your device just contains even more issues due to its closed source code, which I assume is a backdoor (only reason it is not in the open is it contains malicious secrets). The difficulty of trezor shipping some modified hardware in mass scale and not being detected when the hardware itself is open source design is nil given that the hardware is more easy to audit (and less than yours given you don't even have open source hardware and your hardware is harder to audit). The problem is your device contains all the same risks as trezors device **PLUS the additional risk of the closed source software**.

This is actually negative for bitcoin. Holding bitcoin was already legal in japan. This just made it cheaper to spend bitcoins. Spending bitcoins typically mean the bitcoin gets converted to fiat as merchants don't hold bitcoins.

BIP 149 is not superior. It does not activate until July 2018. It will never activate before that date because there is too much profit for Jihan exploiting ASCIBoost.
Let's be honest, by July 2018 bitcoin's network effects and confidence will be lost, so segwit won't even be needed. Bitcoin has no future waiting until 2018. A better alternative would be a contentious hardfork that produced 2 chains. At least in that situation bitcoin has a chance to grow.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:57:07
Wrong. Segwit is a 1.7mb blocks in perfect conditions. And, it opens the network up to a 4x bandwidth attack. So, it is really good miners are blocking it. Considering a hard fork increase in blocksize is inevitable whether you adopt segwit or not (lightning network creators even admit blocks need to be 32MB for it to be usable by the masses), then you might as well just do a hard fork today instead of 6 months from now and while doing the hard fork include a fix that solves malleability without the 4x bandwidth attack vector that segwit has.

There is a fixed peg between RSK and bitcoin. So, it has its own token as its a sidechain, but it is not an altcoin. It won't be traded on an exchange. You convert between the exchanges at a fixed rate (via sending a special transaction)
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:27:51
Exactly. The truth is, someone (core which is backed by blockstream) is trying to make bitcoin fail by crippling it. This in turn pushes people to alts which effectively kills crypto because when there are 2000 different cryptos the market is confusing.
Think about it. Even the lightning network creators have stated that 32MB blocks are needed at a minimum. Otherwise, there would still not be enough transaction space for everyone to use lightning channels.
Segwit is a ONE TIME increase in effective block size by 70% only if 100% of all transactions are using it. After that, there is no more real blocksize increases via a soft fork.
So, given 1.7MB is far away from the minimum 32MB that would be needed even for a functioning lightning network, the truth is **Bitcoin will have to hardfork a larger blocksize at some point**.
The question becomes, WHEN should bitcoin do that? IMO, hard forks (which anecdotally are not risky as lots of coins hard fork all the time. Monero does it every 6 months) would be less risky doing it sooner rather than later when bitcoin is even more entrenched. So, one really has to wonder why the hell bitcoin is not being hardforked with larger blocksizes?

Bitfury signalled BIP148. **Miners will support BIP 148**. Why? Because it is in their economic interests. As long as Jihan can utilize ASCIBoost he has an unfair mining advantage, which means lost profits for everyone else.
Segwit stops ASCIBoost, so the end result is more money for miners who cannot use ASCIBoost (because Jihan owns the patents). 
As a result, every miner who is not Jihan will have economic incentive to support BIP148. They just need to see more users adopting it.

Yes, it can. Prior to segwit it will use a model that requires some trust. Later on it will provide a trustless method to handle the peg.

No, the 1.7x figure is assuming 100% segwit transactions for the most common transactions. It is not based on some "blended" model. Who could even model that since no one knows what % will be segwit or not.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:50:51
With electrum you only need the nodes it connects to be updated in order for a hard forked blocksize increase to work.
On the other hand, with segwit, you need the actual wallets to support the creation of segwit txs in order to reach the potential of a 1.7x blocksize increase.
No one is going to get a low-fee with segwit. The # of transactions submitted to the bitcoin network in the past 24 hours is already greater than 1.7mb per block. As a result, even with segwit and even if it magically had 100% of its benefitted realized on day 1, every single person will still be paying large fees because the blocksize limit will still be too small.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:28:18

Bitcoin is NOT money if you cannot spend it. 300,000 transactions per day. Let that sink in. That is not enough transactions a day for a small city let alone a world wide currency.
Most people in the world are making less than $6000 a YEAR. Do you expect these people to be spending $10-20 a transaction? No way.
Bitcoin's high fees are not a technical necessity at this point. Its restricted blocksize and lack of a malleability fix is also not a technical necessity. It is greed, politics, and a toxic dev team.

NO MORE AGREEMENTS! Don't you get it, agreements among central actors failed. We have already wasted a year due to the Hong Kong agreement. This new agreement is meant to distract people from UASF. As a result, we will continue to debate this issue for yet another year while Jihan collects excessive profits.
This agreement will require 1) ending UASF 2) waiting for current segwit to expire 3) only after that MAYBE will this be implemented. We see from the HK agreement that agreements mean nothing, so no guarantee this will activate. 4) If it does activiate it is still bad because it allows Jihan to exploit the ASICBOOST as segwit as a hard fork does not solve the issue.
**The only way forward is UASF**

Segwit would not affect the backlog though. Segwit would take months to get activated even if miners were on board. Then it would take potentially years for every single wallet to be updated to use only segwit transactions. Only after every single wallet is updated (on every single users machine) would segsit bring a 1.7x increase in blocksize.
So, you are talking about a years long process that still would not help alleviate the fees. The only solution is increasing the blocksize. Even if segwit passes, the only solution is still to increase the blocksize. All roads lead to increasing teh blocksize to some degree.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:30:09

It is ill-gotten when you did not even invent it, but you then seek out a patent in China, which prevents other users from using the same method. This works because the cheapest place to produce ASICs are in China, so basically it makes all other ASIC producers non-competitive.

ASICBoost is not a real optimization. It puts Jihan in direct conflict with the good of the chain. The reason is because there are LOTS of upgrades that will break the ASICBoost advantage. As long as Jihan has this advantage he will block ANY improvement to bitcoin that may block is monopoly.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:39:40
A big reason is that segwit causes a tradeoff. It uses less disk space, but more bandwidth. Given that bandwidth is more scarce than disk space, both for home users and for chinese miners which do not want huge unoptimized blocks due to the great firewall, it is a negative. You can read more about how segwit makes the entire bitcoin network less bandwidth efficient at the same transaction volumes here:

Fast? Bitcoin has been waiting for an upgrades for **years** that solves scalability. The most sane solution would have been a block size increase 2 years ago that activated today. Incredibly safe.
However, it was your FUD about hard forks (something that other chains accomplish regularly such as monero every 6 months) that stopped such a solution.
Now we are in this  mess largely due to your own arrogance or maliciousness in pushing a solution that you basically knew would never pass (no way to get 95% consensus on a highly controversial all-or-nothing change). The most reasonable solution would have been a series of soft forks that solved issues individually, such as a soft fork that only solved malleability. Much less controversial. However, your goal seems to be to delay bitcoin development so I suppose how things happened suits you well.
So, asking for more time is ridiculous. Time has already run out. Bitcoin is in a do-or-die moment. I am not sure if your intention was to kill bitcoin, but if bitcoin does not solve this then like a hydra dragon there are 100 other coins waiting to pick up where bitcoin left off. One positive thing about that will the obsoletion of the millions of millions of dollars of Jihans mining hardware.
Hopefully, if it comes to that, you will not be part of whatever development efforts are in Bitcoin 2.0.

Forking is not bad. Monero does it every 6 months. In fact, every coin except bitcoin does it regularly. Several of them have market caps equal to Bitcoin's market cap when the original fear mongering started of "Bitcoin is too big to fork".
So, empirically it has been shown that forking is great. Even in the 1 case out of hundreds that a chain split occurred (Ethereum), both chains are now far more valuable than what the pre-forked chain was worth. One went up 15x and the other went up basically 10x. Both have increased adoption.
The chance of a chain split in Bitcoin is almost zero due to its long difficulty adjustment. Bitcoin adjusts every 2 weeks. Ethereum adjusts every block. Even with adjusting every block the Ethereum minority chain barely survived due to miners jumping ship. Adjusting every 2 weeks makes it nearly economically impossible unless a large portion of miners want to mine it for 3 months at severe economic losses.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:15:48
It has not been debunked. Segwit decreases storage costs, true, as it allows witness data to be truncated. However, the bottleneck to scaling is not storage as that is super cheap and available to everyone. The bottleneck is bandwidth as that is scarce especially in some countries, which affects decentralization.
Segwit has the effect of worsening the bandwidth bottleneck. So no, segwit does not price transactions correctly.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:16:14
All  I can say is do not panic. This is a correction caused by a trading group. Bull-run is not done. Here is how the manipulation works:
**Mechanics of the Manipulation**
1. Friday afternoon / night in North America there were deep sells (after bank transfers have already been done for that day). This was designed to trigger panic at the point where all banks are closed (since asia / europe is ahead in time their banks already closed), so no way for people to "buy the dip" since everyone is already in bitcoin.
1. This week was chosen because many major countries (such as USA and UK) have a banking holiday on May 29th, which delays all new Fiat until May 30th. This again creates a situation where no one can buy the dip, which increases market panic.
**Goal of the manipulation**
1. Orchestrators sold large quantities of bitcoin to trigger market panic and hopefully the closure of long positions during the panic.
2. While market is panicing they re-buy the bitcoin at cheaper rates and go long on bitcoin. (Profit)
3. Bitcoin bull-run continues on Tuesday when major countries resume banking. It might even fully resume on Sunday night (north american time) / Monday due to Asia (who do not have banking holiday).
To those that think bitcoin is suddenly dying or that the bull-run has stopped are delusional. Bitcoin is still processing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. Every day more companies move into the space. More and more people want to own bitcoin. This is purely market manipulation. Stay strong.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:23:16
It will always be cheaper than ethereum. The reason is that ethereum mixes transfer of value with smart contracts. Bitcoin has two separate chains with capacity dedicated to each use-case. Bitcoin for transfer of value. Rootstock for smart contracts.
The separation of concerns will mean that transaction costs should be cheaper
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:13:30
Ummm, you are once again incorrect. Re-read what I said and hopefully your reading comprehension will improve. A HF does require electrum nodes to upgrade, but that is all.

No joke. I never argued against a 2nd layer solution. Remember, I am the guy saying we need segwit ASAP? However, your big lie that you keep telling people is that a 2nd layer solution works with a 1-1.7mb block size. It doesn't. Even the most optimistic assumptions will require a 32MB blocksize for the use of a 2nd layer by a few hundred million people.
So, given that, **an eventual hardfork of blocksize is inevitable 2nd layer or not**. As a result, it would have been a lot more intelligent to include the code in the reference implementation 2 years ago, so that it could have activated today. And maybe not have created all the FUD about hard forks considering it is inevitable.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:42:14
Well, it is very powerful because ASICs are created by centralized companies, which still must follow patent law. So, no other company can create an ASIC that takes advantage of ASICBoost.
If ASICBoost was just a software setting, then you would be right. But, it requires millions of dollars of R&amp;D and hardware to create it on-chip inside the ASIC, which is the only way that it works.

Who are you responding to? Literally no one is arguing for unlimited blocksize. Lightning network cannot handle visa level of users. This is a fact. Even the authors of lightning network have stated it needs 32MB minimum.
So, you seem pretty ignorant in all honesty. No matter what bitcoin will need to do a hard fork and increase the block limit. Given that segwit, under perfect conditions where 100% of all users are running a segwit compat wallet, can only increase blocksize by 1.7x. And, given that segwit is already obsoleted as the number of transactions submitted with fees to the network in the last 24 hours is already more than 1.7MB.
Well, you can see, segwit is not really logical. A more logical approach would do the hard fork for a block size increase which is already inevitable. And, since we are hard forking anyways, then create a malleability fix that is not constrained by a soft fork so that it can actually be a good fix instead of a fix that opens the network to a 4x bandwidth attack.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:51:15
No it is not false. I just described with facts the problem. If it is false then provide a source. What part of my post is false? The 1.7x effective increase? The 4x potential increase for specially crafted transactions? You are simply ignorant. Educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:04:20
It's a 70% increase not double. And, it will not really do anything. More than 1.7mb/block worth of transactions with fees have been sent in the last 24 hours. So, let's say segwit got activated in 1 month (the soonest it could be), the network demand would likely grow enough that we would already be back in this same situation.
Not to mention it will be years before segwit delivers on that 1.7x increase in block size because it requires every user to update every wallet such that every transaction sent it segwit.

You certainly need to transmit the witness data. Otherwise there is no way to verify the spend is valid. After some time you can drop it from storage and just assume it is safe, but you definitely need to transmit it.

I understand that some transactions are for smart contracts. However, it is developers messing around. Very little is real usage. Most of it is flawed. For example, the ENS system. Don't you think that will just be ported to Rootstock? It has equal value on rootstock. It is responsible for a lot of smart contract usage on ETH.
Then, look at garbage like Etherlance. It should not be in the smart contract and is bloating the Ethereum chain with useless data (It stores so much data in ETH the transaction costs $7.00 to register).
So, really, ETH does not have any network effects. The 1 network effect it did have is developers. And, Rootstock has the exact same network effect because anything written on ETH runs on Rootstock.
Prism exchange, the project just launched by shapeshift, has already announced that it will run on Rootstock too. Any project of real-world use and value will also be on Rootstock. It is 4x faster afterall.

Think about it, if this agreement was true, all the actors would just commit to activating segwit by august 1st, which is compatible with the UASF. Then, in parallel, they can work on a 2mb block size for a time in the future.
This is not a genuine agreement. It is a delay tactic.

It is correct. Segwit raises effective block size limits to 1.7MB. However, specially crafted transactions that users would never send but spammers may send could create blocks up to 4MB. (this is why you see segwit is a 4x blocksize increase but is 1.7x effectively).
As a result of the difference between real transactions and spam transactions it will increase damage done  by spam attacks. Let's pretend that the network can realistically handle 32MB blocks. However, with segwit, a spammer could create blocks that are 128MB in size (4x32MB), which the network could not handle. As a result, you must forever keep the blocksize at 1/4 it's true limit (32MB/4 = 8MB in this example) in order to prevent this spam attack from occurring.
The end result is that the bitcoin network will forever be 1/4 of its real capacity. The truth is, the only feature of segwit that is important for new development is the "Malleability fix". Malleability could be fixed with a MUCH simpler soft-fork that does not also change network incentives (creating the 4x spam attack problem that segwit causes).
One really has to wonder why a solution such as segwit is being pushed.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:47:27

Just a FYI, the same reason why we will never get 95% segwit consensus (ASCIBoost) is the same reason why **a USAF is guaranteed to get a significant portion of miner support**.
The reason? ASCIBoost is zero-sum game. It allows some miners (Jihan) to get outsized profits against other miners. Those miners who do NOT use ASCIBoost are incentivized to signal segwit and support USAF as that will be more profits for them.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:15:18
I am agreeing that 1.7 is not enough. That is why a blocksize increase is needed. A blocksize increase requires a hardfork. Once we admit that we will need to do a hardfork and we will not be limited by the constraints of a softfork, then we can also fix malleability in a better way than segwit, which will not create this spam attack issue.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:15:46
From my understanding, this does destroy asicboost. However, that does not matter because at best this agreement is a delaying tactic and at worst it will never be honored just like the hong kong agreement was never honored.
Ultimately, nothing can force the network / users / miners to this agreement. The only thing that can force anything is **UASF**
If they are genuine about this agreement, then they will help us activate the UASF. Then we can work on a 2mb hard fork after that.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:18:16


We can scale off-chain, but we also must scale on-chain. Refer to the core devs own roadmap where they have recognized it is inevitable. Even the lightning network creators have admitted it. 


No one is against malleability being fixed. It can be fixed in the same hard fork that raises the block size limit. That is better than segwit which introduces a 4x bandwidth attack.


Are you really that ignorant or are you trolling? Unlimited has never stated no block size. If that was the case there would be no "emergent consensus". There would simply be no cap on the block size. Use your head, buddy.


Again, you show your ignorance. Maybe you are not a technical person, so let me break it down to you. Lightning network is limited **by user** not *by transaction*. So showing it scales to visa level transactions is stupid. How about you show it can scale to visa level of *users* (let's say 2 billion people).
Because, the real math of it is, that even using some very generous and frankly unrealistic assumptions, even 32MB only gets you to a couple hundred million users.

If bandwidth is the issue then segwit is a worse solution than a blocksize increase. It results in a 4x multiplier for spam transactions that affects bandwidth. The tradeoff is less disk space usage. But, as you pointed out, bandwidth is the limiter, so it is better to be conservative on bandwidth than disk space and bandwidth is exactly what segwit causes more of.

You really do not understand what updating a wallet means in this context it seems/ Let's use electrum as an example. If tomorrow it releases a segwit wallet that does not mean that electrum users are updated. It could be years before users download the latest version.
As a result, the best-case scenerio for segwit providign a 1.6-2x increase would not be realized until years. Until the very last user updated the wallet they are using.

That is because he is wrong. The federated peg is a stop-gap measure until bitcoin supports the required opcodes to make it trustless. Once it does, then it will be a drivechain.
Considering that ethereum has been around for years and has yet to find a valid use-case, it is basically guaranteed that by the time smart contracts find their use-case that Rootstock will well be a trustless setup.

Miners will NEVER signal segwit without a UASF. That is the entire point. Why will they not signal? Because &gt; 5% of miners benefit from covert ASCIBoost which lets them get outsized mining profits.
ASCIBoost enables Jihan to earn hundreds of millions of dollars versus other miners. No other miners can use the same tactic because Jihan owns the patents. So, everyday we wait will centralize mining more and more, which will make any such change that threatens ASCIBoost impossible to pass via miners.
I agree with you about a HF. If you read my comments in this thread I am for a hardfork. Nullc has made a career out of creating FUD around a hardfork even though a HF is necessity even if we get segwit and even if we use 2nd layer solutions. A HF is inevitable.
Certainly, a hard fork planned 2 years ago would have been best. However, we have what we have today. Right now segwit is the best we can do. And, immediately after we get segwit we should also talk about a HF and clear up the misconceptions around it.

A company did not just get some funding. The company already has a product and it will be releasing it within a month. You can view it right now on testnet:

The fork may cause an existential crisis in crypto and damage its network effects.

The problem is that so many other people feel the same. The last 2013 runup there was a 50% drop from 900 to 450. From there it shot up to 1300. Once this recovers on Tuesday, which is basically a guarantee, it will just train people to have stronger hands.
Up until now the  new entrants have never dealt with a loss, so they are panic selling. After this, they will not make that mistake again. That is when the real bull run comes.

But why would they be onboard with something that only offers a 70% increase (1.7x) in block size and opens the network up to a 4x bandwidth attack? Considering a hardfork block size increase is inevitable it might as well be done today and in that same hard fork a malleability fix can be included that does not include the 4x spam attack that segwit enables.

This is stupid. **Miners will support USAF!**. That is an ECONOMIC FACT.
Why? Because ASCIBoost allows Jihan to profit at the expense of every other miner in the ecosystem. **Every miner except Jihan is highly motivated to activate Segwit too** as it increases their own profits.
So, trust me, once USAF gains more acceptance the hashrate WILL follow. The only one who won't follow is Jihan as he tries to get more ASCIBoost profits.

Ethereum is the testnet of Rootstock.

This is the close of nearly a year long bubble from $300 to $2700 in price. I would not be surprised if it corrected for a week and traded sideways for months.

I don't think anyone is advocating a 32MB block size tomorrow. Certainly a 2 or 4MB block size should be very possible. Miners do not care about the block size for their own validation needs. Most miners nowadays are quite large. The entire data center of miners can afford the couple terabytes is required among all serves (it is not like every mining chip needs its own copy of the block chain. One copy for all chips in the entire data center is enough).
Full nodes care more about it since that is more decentralized. However, budget full nodes can easily truncate. For those that want to store every transaction seagate has a 60TB SSD though there is no reason for SSD. A normal node can just run with a standard raid setup with 5TB. That will be enough for years worth of blockchain growth.

The hardfork could have been prepared 2 years ago to be activated tomorrow. Instead, we have segwit which is highly controversia versus a hard fork which is not controversial and which everyone (core + BU + miners) all agree is necessary. The question becomes, why was the HF blocked 2 years ago?
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:47:37
My guess no. Last runup in 2013 there was a big crash like the one 1-2 weeks ago. Then from there it blasted off 300% in a huge bull run.

That is even more support that the price will keep going up.

No idea. Probably not hacked though if there are still coins in the wallet.

It's actually better to check middle characters. This malware will oftentimes have the same first and last digits as they have generated tons of vanity addresses.
