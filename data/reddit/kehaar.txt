Anyone else think that the timing of the news from China is a little suspicious, seeing as how the first CBOE futures contracts settle tomorrow? Anyone shorting Bitcoin is really happy to hear the news right now.
The good news is that, if this is related to BTC shorting, it's all over tomorrow...for another month.

Question: is this guys name legitimately Tuur Demeester? Or is this internet for Turd Meister. Because I seriously cannot tell. Been trying to figure this out for over a year now.

NPR's Marketplace had an interesting piece on "how much money is there in the world" yesterday. Actual physical currency? 1.5 trillion US denominated, 5 trillion worldwide. Actual money supply created largely by banks, ~ 80 trillion.
