Hopefully you're not associating your BTC with your credit. That would be dumb.

When you sign into the Ledger Manager, it verifies it right off the bat. If it updates it's authentic. If the update stops, it's got some issues.

I just had to pay 40 bucks to un-stall a $700 transaction.

I can't access any wallet from the manager, I don't know that I'm supposed to be able to. They are all Chrome apps, independent of each other.

I guess I read something wrong. I thought you ended up having problems with both cables. 
Sounds like the magnetic cable is a/the issue. Might need to scrap it.

I didn't download the 64 version, just the 32. I had all the same issues you are having, with every wallet I tried. Then I deleted every device that this showed and it worked.
If you can't get the program working, try uninstalling all of you USB drivers and then re-install them.

I thought 110 was ok. It used to be.

I had all sorts of these same problems, [here]( is a quick post I made about the fix that worked for me.

 Yes, wait. Wait forever.

Perfect time to buy the coin's that you think might succeed.

Same as all money. It's only worth what people make it worth. Why don't people understand this?

Which one is actually the scam? Nobody knows.
