bitcointipbot is primarily used for tipping people who already know about bitcoin. The idea is to raise awareness outside of these communities with people who otherwise would not know about/use BTC.

&lt;3 Thank you kind stranger! The first time I have received gold!
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:34:50
Sounds like a great idea!
  
  Though the one thing that gets me is giving a fiat value discount for using BTC. The discount should be 1mBTC. This lets the market value of BTC dictate the value of the discount, keeping true to the ideology.

c) Get repeat bitcoin users
  
  If a customer purchases with bitcoin, offer a compounding btc loyalty discount. e.g. Fist purchase is full price. Second 5%, third 6% fourth 7% all the way to 10%. If they use fiat, it resets back to full price.
  
  That will not only encourage customers to use BTC, but will encourage return business because they get a good discount each time.
  
  
  Alternatively, you could have a notice letting customers know how much you need to pay on transaction fees, and offer to credit that amount to their account for each further bitcoin purchase. Purchase 1 is fiat, send the notice. Purchase 2 is btc, they are credited the fees saved for both 1 and 2. Since it is a credit, not a discount, they will need to send it with you.

From a long-term investment point of view, this crash is a good thing. It allows BTC to return to normal, natural growth. I think people crying about the crash, and how they lost x amount of fiat is more fitting to your comment.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:41:19
I am not a great writer, so forgive me if it is hard to follow, but I will try and get the meaning of my point across.
  
  As far as a company adopting BTC, I have two major questions. Firstly, what classification of company? And secondly, What do you mean by adopting? This could mean accepting as payment, investing, supporting the currency, etc. For the purpose of this point, I will focus on a retail company accepting BTC as payment.
  
  Alright, so at first glance, I see two blaring reasons for a company to accept BTC. Firstly, to reach a wider audience. Accepting another payment method is a great way to encourage customers to buy from you. We have all been to a website, got to the counter and realised they only accept bank transfer, or they only accept credit card and you want to use pay pal; most of us will just go somewhere else. We are spoiled for choice and it is becoming the small things which make the difference.
  
  Secondly, purely for appearances. This is a less tangible reason, though it is similar to using ipads for transactions, buying a fountain for your foyer, upgrading your computers when the old ones still work. If a company adopts technology, keeps at the forefront of the market, they will appear successful. Most people will much prefer dealing with a successful company, than one which is getting by.

This is a really good idea, I have been trying to convince a number of friends to get into using bitcoins, but they have been reluctant and use the excuse that it is 'too hard to setup'. If I do all the hard yards for them, and give them a kick start, they'll get addicted.

Clearly you feel quite strongly about this. I do not need to cite that averages do not hold true for any given period; that is just common knowledge.
  
  As far as being a lot higher than 1 transaction per second I believe you have just proved this in your math, it is almost 150% of the value you mentioned earlier. Have a look through some of the history of this sub and you will see that there have been delays in sending BTC because of high volumes. I’m really not as bothered by this as you, so I will let you do the looking.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:34

I talk about BTC to my friends/family/coworkers too, though I make sure I do NOT tell them how much I own. They know what the price was when I invested, and what it currently is, but not how much I have. It is quite a personal question, and no good comes of people knowing how much more money you have than them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:36:23
Looks really good, I know you don't want to hear about any bugs, but I found one :(
  
  If you change the exchange, you can't then change the currency. e.g. I changed from MtGox to BitStamp. After that, the currency dropdown was locked and I am unable to change it to NZD.
  
  A possible feature would be a 'reverse' calculation, where you can enter the fiat value and calculate how many (much?) BTC you could get in exchange.
  
  Really like the design though, simple and elegant, good job :D

It would be great if a new bitcoiner could go there and find all the information they need, e.g. wallet types, security, exchanges, etc.

If I was to make a brain wallet, I would shuffle a deck of cards, then draw the cards one at a time, using the value/suit e.g. 7D (seven of diamonds), KS (king of spades), etc.
  
  The potential permutations in a deck of cards is 52! (fifty two factorial), which is about 8x10^67 . This is far more random than rolling a dice, or mashing the keyboard.
  
  And just for fun, chuck in a fact about cats.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:12:32
If you want to use it for less than legal purposes, or simply like tinfoil hats, you would create a separate wallet for buying things from stores which require verification and places which don't. But just don't send from your legitimate wallet to your 'hidden' wallet.

Well C++, but you really don't want to start there. I would reccomend java or C both of them are C based and very widly used.
  
  Only start learning C# if you have visual studio, otherwise java is the way to go; I'm personally a big fan of java. Java is cross platform and very simple and cear what is happening, it's nice, easy, and obvious about what is happening as well as being extremely powerful.

Most defiantly; for the value to drop that low, all buy orders down to that level needed to be filled.
  
  During times like these, a lot of people also have a standing buy order which is well below the market price. This allows them to catch any major fluctuations in value.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:25:58
Basically they are two different, independent exchanges. The way trading works is there needs to be a sell order matching a buy order for the transaction to take place. In theory, if there are a lot more buy orders than there are sell orders, supply is low and demand is high, so the price will increase. If there are a lot more sell orders than there are buy orders, supply is high and demand is low, so the price will decrease. Note that the price will not change simply because the supply or demand is high/low, people have to WANT to sell, or WANT to buy for the price to actually move.
  
  With this in mind, as well as the fact that they are two independent markets with real people trading on them, we realise that either of the markets could be worth more at any point. Even though this is true in theory, it is not true a lot of the time, mainly because of popularity, volumes, market manipulation, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:51:51
Wow, good for you! I love that fact that normal people who wouldn't normally be rich are getting huge amounts of money from this.
  
  The only advice I would give you is to read ALL about taxes, chat and to an accountant before cashing out. There would be nothing worse than a) losing it all, or b) not knowing you have to pay tax and wracking up a huge debt.
  
  Also, for a bonus, leave ~50-100 in BTC to see what happens. You have made it big and don't want to be kicking yourself in several years time when they (maybe) end up being worth a small fortune each.
  
  Best of luck and once again congrats!

  They most likely either didn't know how to sell, or wanted out. Most people will sell in small amounts to avoid disrupting the market and maximising the value of the sale.

I stopped mining with my GPU about 3 1/2 months ago. It just became too dificult and started costing money. It is fun to play around with as an introduction to BTC, but don't expect to earn anything.

Totally understand, but don't let yourself mistake wanting to have a potential source of money in the future as greed. It is important to have some money tucked away somewhere just in case everything goes 'tits up' so to speak. That said, BTC might not be the safest place for it.
