This can happen to anyone using an exchange that's not located in North America. Your best bet is to buy BTC on Coinbase/GDAX/Gemini/Kraken/QuadrigaCX and then send the BTC to the exchange of your choice.

Wrong. The Federal Reserve creates M0 (monetary base) and supply notes and coins to banks on request. Banks create the majority of money (M2) through lending.

This is absolutely not how banking works, at all. Deposits are not "loaned" out, the bank literally creates new money out of thin air by typing a few digits into a computer.

Canadians don't have the right to express his or her opinions at all if it's counter to the government sponsored narative. Bill C-16 was passed last year, which makes it a **hate crime** to refer to a transgender person by traditional gender pronouns. The Liberal government is also currently in the process of making "Islamaphobia" a criminal act without actually defining Islamaphobia, leaving it open to the most broad interpretation. If you think that sounds like a country with free speech, then you're the one who is being obtuse.

I don't support Hillary or Trump, I think they're both in the pockets of banks and corporations. But the larger issue is that ALL Presidents and politicians are glorified actors who are pre-selected, and who ultimately vote in the best interests of their donors and not their constituents. Democracy doesn't really exist, only the illusion of democracy.

First sentence of the wikipedia article: **Freedom of expression in Canada is not absolute; Section 1 of the Charter allows the government to pass laws that limit free expression so long as the limits are reasonable and can be justified in a free and democratic society.**
Canada does not have Freedom of Speech, period. Claiming that it does with an asterisk is Orwellian Doublethink.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is commonly referred to as the central bank for central banks, aka. the world's central bank. In fact if you Google "central bank for central banks", you'll get the BIS wikipedia and their websites as the top results.
