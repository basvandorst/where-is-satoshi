yeah its called segwit

so be it, if it gets anywhere near mainstream means bitcoin is a success and even 50 dollars is cheap, not event talking about flat fees/kB vs BTCUSD performance
block confirmation was unreliable since the start, outbidding, behavior change (not waiting for 0 conf) affected the "reliabilty", pay fast pass tickets and you reduce such variance

no its called free market, you dont like free market? and its NOT a payment system, number of bitcoins is limited, do you think its not a bidding war on bitcoins? i want my 99$ bitcorn dead serious

it still costs pennies relative to BTCUSD performances, HODLers not affected

which is the case of bitcoin, if you reffering to 1mb block cap is called a security rule that nodes enforcing to avoid the ledger to be worthless re decentralization and number of nodes, also keep in mind that blockreward is just a kickstarter incentive for miners to secure the network, if you dont like it why dont you fork it and make unlimited blocks and delete the 21 million bitcoins cap?

since you want to make a bitcoin transaction when network getting bloated by higher fees than yours, and since ofc price doubled in a year

1. not true its consensus based limit, if you want bigger you just fork
2. needs to be scarce doesnt mean it cant be free market
3. nodes can set minrelaytxfee as the pleased and miners can mine empty or not full blocks
