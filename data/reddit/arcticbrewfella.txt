Yes, sorry. I should have been more specific. Both parties that scammed me refused to show govt ID. I was however shown a 'bank statement' from one scammer and a promise of trust and an ID from the other. The bank statement was a screen grab of the bank account that was used to transfer money. At the time I thought it seemed odd but in retrospect I realize I was stone cold stupid for not realizing a scammer would likely be able to obtain such an image easily. 
The take home lesson for me here has be 'TRUST NO ONE' and always validate the identity of the trader. 
To continue the analogy, I think btcfun is on the money. Except I feel like one hooker said "Yeah, baby. Im kleen, Ill prove it to you AFTER' and the other was like 'yeah baby here's a questionable copy of a record from the doc's office indicating that I was there for a check up'.

Thank you for your words. 
You're correct. I made a huge mistake accepting those transfers. I figured I'd share my minor tragedy with the community to help other avoid future pains.  Fuck me right? Who do I think I am trying to help YOU avoid scams?
My apologies for trying to make a contribution to the integrity of our community. Ill keep my experiences to myself in the future. 
Also, Im not sure where you are getting the idea of vigilante justice. I made no physical threats and should have specified that I wish my future encounter with the thieves to be in a court room, where my property is rightfully returned to me. I will offer a bounty on info, not heads.

If there is only $12M worth of value in the entire bitcoin system, then creating more will not increase the value of the system, it will only decrease the value of the individual units of exchange.

Au contraire. . . According to RBC telephone agents the transfer can not be reversed. It can be cancelled before the recipient cashes it, but after that no charge backs.

yep and yep. New at the localbitcoins.com trading. Learned a lesson. Unfortunately, I live in a very small town and am probably the only one who is aware of Bitcoin. For this I must sell online If I want any business.

I feel obliged to pay the tax man because I enjoy health care and roads and infrastructure etc. 
There are not specific laws on the books that pertain to crypto however there are laws that are easily applied. The law about taxation on barter trades is an example. BTC exchanged for goods and services could be considered under that one. Also capital gains tax when you cash out btc for fiat.
I'd prefer to not coax the gov't to feel the need to create unnecessary laws around btc.

Pretty much. I have all my CAD-&gt;BTC purchases recorded. I probably can dig up logs or whatever of mining operations.
All of this is accounted for as best a possible. I have experienced gain and loss trading on exchanges as well. I could likely dig up the trade records, and probably will shortly. 
So yeah, I have documentation. However I'm not sure if a printout of a transaction on btc-e is considered official documentation. Its the best that can be done.

I would not likely send my card to a stranger on the internet either. But in order to insure that my accounts arent frozen again, I need to insist that my customers do this. I extend the same courtesy; I will show my ID so they too can be confident in our trade. I wish there was a less intrusive way to establish trust but so far this seems to be the only option.

+1 agree, pythfaun. 
Although I don't agree that sore123 should discontinue his life. I do feel that even the densest of twats can one day grow into intelligent people. Furthermore, If he wishes to not trade with me because he doesnt want to send his ID to a stranger on the internet, I totally understand. I probably wouldn't send my ID to me either. However the unfortunate reality is that as a seller accepting a high risk payment option I must insist that all future clients identify themselves. I simply can not transact with someone who can not confirm that their transaction is not fraudulent. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:09:06


Yes, I did. You cant just create value in a system by increasing the number of coins, just like you can't create more pie by cutting it into smaller pieces. 
If you are talking about a system that has 12M of value, then it has 12M of value. Increasing the number of coins doesnt create more value, doing so just divides the existing value into smaller pieces. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:24:22
I hear you. However, as I mention above I do enjoy benefits of the state. Although there is nothing specifically compelling me to give up my taxable earnings (or claim losses) on btc, I do think that I should pay my fair* share for the services and infrastructure provided by the man. Btc in some ways is no different then any other taxable gain. I mine coin and sell it, taxable. I bake pies and sell them, taxable. 
*with btc one has a fair degree of control over what is deemed 'fair'.

A fraud investigation is now under way. I cant use email money transfer until its complete (and maybe not ever again after this).

Do you have a link explaining this further? In my simple mind: if I have a device that can some how influence the spinning or vibration of a quantum particle based on the sound I produce with my vocal cords, then its entangled particle out in another galaxy will spin/vibrate in the exact same manner. A person observing the entangled particle could then recreate the wave form of my voice based on the way their particle (that's entangled with mine) spins/vibrates.  Maybe you'd need a number of entangled particles to achieve this; I imagine one could also 'transmit' digital data like this too.  Am I misunderstanding this?

Your btc exist at an address on a block chain. You use a live boot linux cd to create a 'safe' environment to access your coins. 


Im not familiar with Armory but you will need to remember, by whatever means, the public and private keys to your coins. A good idea is to create an encrypted drive to hold your info.
Here's a good look at cold storage with bticoinqt. Armory may be easier or better. [cold storage with bitcoinqt]

One needs to pay capital gains tax on any money one makes through investment. So if you made money on buying and selling bitcoin, you need to pay tax on the profit. Just the same as if you go door to door mowing peoples lawns for money, you are to pay taxes on money made over a certain amount. 
Will you claim income tax on the money you made mowing lawns? The choice is yours, but the tax man may hunt you down if he thinks you owe him money.

@_date: 2013-12-05 23:05:27
From one Nova Scotian to another (well, I grew up in NS but have since moved on) here's what I can offer:


Yes you do. If you can find 5, 10 or 100 dollars you can get involved. Also, the very fact that you are posting here suggests you are computer literate enough to figure Bitcoin out. There are plenty of resources here and elsewhere on the net. Mind your security. 


I dont know, are you? 20 mins of reading online should be enough to get your head around the thing if you are totally confused. It is sort of like a stock, .. but not really as there is no company or anything like that behind bitcoin. Its a currency, a deflationary currency, a protocol and a network backed by the mathematical work of miners and the value we all agree to trade at. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, its sort of a new thing, in a class of it's own. 


Very. Start now, you may regret not doing so a few months down the road. Instead of buying that case of Schooner this weekend, put the cash towards some coin. 


First figure out if you want to run bitcoinqt, armory, or use an online wallet (avoid brain wallets as they are not very safe).
Get some money into [cavirtex]( and then buy some coin. Or you could use another exchange like Vault of Santoshi or even mtgox or btc-e (the first two are Canadian, I use cavirtex, never had a problem). Also, you can check out localbitcoins, there must be folks in Hali selling bitcoins.
Once you have coins, you can spend them or do like I do and just watch [bitcoinity](bitcoinity.org/markets) all day. Im playing this game long, so Im very conservative with spending my coins. 
I hope that helps. Let me know if I can clarify anything. Im not an expert by any means, but I can provide some assistance. 
Take er easy!

Nah, I dont think many actually know what a saw tooth is, even though they probably hear saw tooth waves every day.

I'm in Canada. Would the 10BTC price would put someone close to a basic commercial license, minus many hours of flight time?

Your jib, nice cut. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:16:58
You're probably right. I hope they have a discount for BTC spenders. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:16:30
No worries, Thanks for the response. Ill adjust noscript and continue staring at your awesome service.
Please, keep up the good work!

I have my fee set at 0.01btc. Not sure why it wants .07

Nice work. Bitcoins 4 Jebus!

I do think this is my issue. Thanks.

Wow, thanks for this. If only one could figure out how to entangle two particles that vibrate in response to the frequency of your voice,.. you'd have yourself an actual ansible. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:13:32
Thanks again. Yes, I think I must have messed up the .dat files because I is downloading the BC again. 
Can you elaborate on why you recommend an average BTC person like myself is better off with an ewallet as opposed to running a node?

I use these guys to buy BTC. Pretty easy to get ca$h in and out. Some folks here on reddit have called scam on them but I have yet to experience a problem. 
Online wallets are ok if you take precautions,... Look into security related to bitcoin, there have been plenty of posts here on Reddit detailing the steps to ensure your online wallet is secure. 
Good luck fellow Canuck!

I think your  oversight related to securing your BTC assets was to use a pirated operating system. As many have already pointed out, there are many free opensource OS's available to use out there. 
We live and we learn. Good luck in the future.

Ha! A bitcoin colab would be swell. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 19:01:25
I'd buy soap. Price? I suppose it depends on the quality and quantity of the product. I would easily pay 1btc for a bar or two, shipping included. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:42:58
Why not? Maybe you can trade on one and cash out/in on the other.

Thanks. In my situation, I leave my machine on 24/7 (most of the time), connected to the web. My system monitor indicates that the load on my cpus is slim when I run bitcoinqt, also bitcoinqt doesn't seem to be hogging much bandwidth, blockchain downloads aside...
I've heard that it is good for the network to have as many nodes as possible and I am glad to share a bit of my 'IT resources' with the bitcoin network. 
Are there any reasons not to run a node in a scenario like mine? Other than maintaining software versions and using some electricity?

Interesting point. Each locality could have its own cryptocurrency that can be moved from locality to locality when required. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:07:34
Or anywhere else.

A little more info...
My experience in python is limited, but after looking at that sommore it would seem that all you need to do is have the GoxCLI, then write a python script that imports the GoxCLI and uses the commands the CLI provides. You'd write statements in ython to grab, and process the data sent back from the CLI. 
As I said, I have little experience in Python, but I think that this should be simple for someone with a basic understanding. 
Good Luck.

Good question. I would assume that a vendor would charge applicable taxes on any sales. . . I live in Canada. Online shops charge sales taxes based on where one lives. I dont think international folk pay taxes. Would the case not be the same for BTC transactions?
If im a vendor who accepts BTC, and Im shipping to a fellow countrymen who lives in Ontario, where the sales tax is X%, I would add X% to the total price of the order. 
I dont see why BTC would be treated differently than any other currency. 
A vendor and customer could avoid taxes if they wanted to by transacting with BTC, but then again the same could be done with hard cash. 
Apologies for the brain fart, I really dont know the answer. But let me turn it around and ask "Why would vendors not charge tax on BTC transactions?"
