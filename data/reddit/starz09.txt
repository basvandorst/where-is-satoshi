I might be confusing it with a different service sorry.

Do I have to get my own wallet for it or is it a free wallet provided by them?

Maybe I don't want to be mugged but thank you.

Thank you to Everyone that commented. I think I'll just wait for my birthday and let bitcoins infrastructure improve. If I lose out then I'll always have my dreams. Ciao

The point is to do it legally.

I am starting to agree with you. I might as well wait. It will save me alot of time and money. Who knows what the market will do.

Your completely wrong. Something is only valued at what we think it's worth not by the fact that can do something.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:53:19
So you would say that people only believe in something because others believe in it? Thus there's more... let's say.... value?   ;)

That's what we're doing though. We're exploiting each for profit. You just wouldn't understand. ;)

Thank you. I appreciate at least one person who understands what I'm trying to say.

First of all you catch me on grammar even though you make similarly the same mistake. Second, you believe that I'll fail and lose money and you boast about your index funds why are you even on a subreddit that supports bitcoin in the first place? Your entire stance seems to be against bitcoin...

Why do people believe in an afterlife if there's no proof? Why do people believe government is for the good of the people? Why does anyone listen to people on reddit who spout wrong facts and believe them as TRUE? Now you tell me?
