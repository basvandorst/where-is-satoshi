So lightning basically takes a queue of txs and pushes them to the network utilizing whatever empty space is available, presumably catching up during off peak network usage? How are txs validated in lightning if they don't hit the bitcoin network immediately?

Keep a watch on the accum/dist line on btc. Each time it shows a recovery the line is still dropping. [Bitfinex]( is the only exchange holding the wall each time. This looks like either an economic coup or the tether crashing and bitfinex working their exit before the [jig is up]( Not sure how the whole bch politic war is affecting things, but I'm sure that's playing a part as well.

I would be more comfortable with nuclear if we had responsible social authority organizations. My understanding is that the nuclear material needed for power can be weaponized much easier than from scratch.

True, but if people stop valuing it then miners will either switch coins or stop altogether and the difficulty of mining will scale which will scale the cost of mining and the subsequent price. Every element is interdependent.

I think it would be interesting to see how the community responds to another fork on crypto's main pony so soon. Smooth waters do not make strong sailors. Whatever benefit or detriment the actual blocksize increase has, it's nothing to the valuable information of how hardfork politics can operate. BTC is probably going to be around for a long time, but I seriously doubt it will remain the top marketcap for very much longer. It wasn't built for mass adoption, it was built as an experiment. With all of the tech being developed inspired by BTC with a mind for mass adoption there will undoubtedly be a Google to the AOL that is BTC.

LOOKS LIKE THEY INTEND TO BRANCH OUT DEVELOPMENTALLY. THEIR APP LOOKS SOLID FOR LAY USERS, AND AS AN INSTITUTION INSTEAD OF A WALLET THEY CAN BRAND FEATURES OF THEIR WALLET APP, BRAND OTHER APPS THEY MAY BE WORKING ON FOR OTHER CRYPTO PURPOSES, OR BRAND FEATURES THEY CAN SELL TO OTHER COMPANIES.

A lot of cryptocurrencies have little to no intrinsic value, but bitcoins proof of work model was designed to cost the miner enough resources to create value. Basically you take cost of mining times the chance to mine one bitcoin and you have a set value. As mining becomes more costly the value of each coin rises.

Blockchain is a ledger, each block is a page filled with transactions. Every ten or so minutes BTC starts recording on a new page. A fork happens when some of the people updating their own redundant ledgers (miners) want to change something about their ledger. Maybe they want to use bigger pages because each page is filling up before ten minutes pass (blocksize increase) or maybe they want to use smaller letters so they don't have to change notebooks (segwit) or maybe both (segwit2x). Whatever each ledger keeper (miner) decides to do to address the issue of filled pages, they all have kept the exact same log up until now. So going forward their ledgers will be incompatible with each other (big pages vs. small letters) but the history is the same. The first ledger entry on each new ledger will start with every wallet address holding the same amount, but the first transactions recorded will be unique to each ledger. Users can now use their coins on each ledger in different ways.

I can totally relate. I've got a few certs and got really frustrated with all the hyped non technical promotion of ideas with absolutely no substance or detail to be found. This has helped me a lot to identify some projects with real long term value.

Safe is a relative term. Your private keys are held and managed by a private, for profit, third party. If they get hacked, you could lose your funds. If the company fails you could lose your funds. If the CEO decides to go rogue and steal all the keys on his server and dump the funds into a hidden monero wallet and move to Zimbabwe you could lose your funds. 
On a more subtle note they are skimming off a sizeable portion of the wealth of their users for the simple act of swapping currencies, which is a pretty typical example of issues with financial institutions and why we need crypto in the first place.

I think the argument was that mainstream adoption will bring with it innovation as more people will be dedicated to making bitcoin efficient since they all rely on it. It's sort of a chicken egg scenario though since it needs to work better to gain adoption. Perhaps all of the elements work together in a positive feedback loop and the cycle gains momentum as each element gains momentum.

I don't think so. The atm I used required a set number of blocks past the one my tx was listed in for it to be irreversibly confirmed. Higher tx fees will get miners to broadcast your tx in a block sooner (like if it's rush hour and a series of blocks are full then high tx fee gets priority while tx's with low fees wait for congestion to clear) but they still are not irreversibly confirmed for however many blocks the atm is set to (generally six).
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:17:45
You first get a receipt with a claim number. Once your tx is confirmed (6 blocks or whatever deep) you get a notification through text and go back and input your claim number and the atm spits out da monies

Looks like they intend to branch out developmentally. Their app looks solid for lay users, and as an institution instead of a wallet they can brand features of their wallet app, brand other apps they may be working on for other crypto purposes, or brand features they can sell to other companies. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:19:08
I think at the current phase were in it's more valuable than problematic to accept a pending transaction for this sort of micro tx (though I am unaware whether or not they do). Sure, six confirmations make the transaction immutable, but personally I haven't had a single transaction rejected out of a few hundred total. The risk of losing maybe 0.1% of sandwich sales for the benefit of spreading awareness which will in turn spur innovation of btc and cc, seems worth it to me.

The last question says CoinBase will not keep the coins or support the hard fork. The hard fork coins still get made though, will they burn them?

Dunno why youre getting downvotes. He and his team are trying but what can you expect from a company of less than 4000 employees (many temp content filterers for a given area based on need) that manages a platform of 68 mil from various cultures/moral constructs. The process of deciding when and how to pivot takes far longer than for the 24/7 active userbase to evolve. 
Dorsey is speaking in favor of crypto, he knows how inadequate his platform is ultimately in the face of decentralization, but its still clearly useful today.
