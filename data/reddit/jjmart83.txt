I think the best tip for trading is research everything you buy. Don't get mesmerized by huge 24 hour gains and buy without researching hoping to catch a cheap ride to the moon because the next day it might be an expensive trip to the bottom of the ocean. Never treat it as pure gambling. 
Also always think of altcoins in terms of BTC/satoshi and not USD.

Has Bitmain figured out cold fusion so they can personally operate every single miner they can build? If not then they can make more by selling some of them at a price that leaves enough profit for buyers that it is (slightly) worth it, and run as many as they can themselves on their own mining pool that takes all  of the fees and only shares the block reward.

FYI, you could save money on fees next time of you transfer BTC from Coinbase to GDAX (free), exchange BTC for LTC or ETH as a maker (free), send LTC/ETH to other exchange (no fee from GDAX, only network fee which is lower than it would be for sending BTC).
If you search YouTube for something like "use GDAX to save on fees" you should find videos.

So you bought minted gold coins, melted them and then formed them into jewelry or did the jewelry store except your gold coins as payment? My point was nobody uses gold that is purely speculative, which in the case of gold certificates might not even physically exist, as a form of currency.

With Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson supposedly creating a crypto based Patreon replacement (seemed like market had upturn right around time of this announcement), I think we could begin to see the death of PayPal and the rise of crypto as the preferred form of payment on the internet. With brick and mortar retailers already starting to die this could mean that crypto could become the preferred form of payment for household purchases.
