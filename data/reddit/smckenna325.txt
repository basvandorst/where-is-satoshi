FDIC guaranteed are only for USD deposits, right?  Not your coins.  And I believe only up to a certain $ amount.  This only gives Coinbase/Gemini a slight edge over other exchanges (but only if your funds are in USD).
Other exchanges, especially ones overseas, are even riskier than that.  All of them, for example, could be shut down at any moment and you do not own your coins there so you lose EVERYTHING.  Take BTC-e as an example; the FBI got involved and they had to shut their doors and rebrand.. they came back up, but not to users in the USA so many USA customers were just SOL if their accounts had been dormant and they needed to re-verify.  I lost ~8BTC there personally but luckily my main account was still active and I was able to get my other coins off.
Then Mt.Gox, of course.
There's really no argument for leaving your coins on an exchange unless you are actively day-trading them (and then you still have to assume the above risks).  They could decide tomorrow they would rather just take your funds and shut down.  Their or another government can intervene and shut them down.  They could have a coding error and go out of business by accident.  They could get hacked and all your coins with it.  The possibilities for loss of your coins when they are not in your possession are astronomical compared to you personally having control of them. 
Keep in mind when your coins are on an exchange YOU do *not* actually own them.  Someone else owns them on your behalf and is giving you a "digital credit" which may not be worth anything at any time they deem fit.
Get yourself a Nano Ledger S directly from their site.  It's very user friendly and there are YouTube videos that will walk you through every step.
What you can do after you get a hardware wallet is set it up, send a tiny amount of coin to it, then wipe it and see if you can't reset it yourself and get your coin back.  This way you know you know how to recover it.  Once you are confident, send the rest of your coins and make sure your seed is properly stored so that you can never lose it and no one else can get access to it.

No, they're just slow as fuck and finally realizing their coin is dying which has lit the fire under their asses.
