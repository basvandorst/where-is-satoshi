Ok, you pulled that out of your ass, but ok.

Under Section 1031 of the tax code, exchanges of like-kind property do not trigger recognition of capital gains, and therefore are tax-free. Whether or not bitcoins/altoins are like-kind is uncertain to say the least...This is a very difficult test to apply to virtual currency. Although nothing is for certain when it comes to bitcoins...(insert author's opinion)...edit: IRS Notice 2014-21 concluded that bitcoins are not a foreign currency, therefore it is possible that bitcoin can qualify for like-kind treatment if the "rights and characteristics" test is met."   
They do qualify, alt coins are like-kind property to bitcoins and it wouldn't take a tax genius to point out they obviously are nearly identical.  We aren't trading bitcoins for pineapples or lambos, we are trading LIKE-KIND currencies, with blockchains and networks, that are built on the very foundation of bitcoin.  They ARE like-kind, by any logical definition AND the IRS definition.  You're gonna be hard pressed convincing me litecoin isn't LIKE  bitcoin...

Well, Finland citizens see their taxes working for them, so it's a little different than it is in the US where all our taxes goes to military and social security for the elderly.

Dude, the comment I responded to literally explains why it's not.

Uh...the NY stock exchange networks could crash as well....we could also all turn into zombies.

This is my angle, if you need money, sell what you need, otherwise, move your holdings to the alt currencies.  Bitcoin is a store of value, like gold is, and alt coins are a store of bitcoin value.  I tell people I own bitcoin, like I ask someone for a Kleenox.  I don't actually have any bitcoin and that's a tissue.

According to the IRS, "In a 1031 exchange, gold must be exchanged for gold while silver must be exchange for silver. Gold is not considered like-kind to silver given gold is held primarily for investment while silver is held for use as an industrial commodity. "
So gold is a hold of value or investment, while silver doesn't qualify because it is used in so many day to day industrial productions.  Are you planning on using bitcoin as an investment, but build a microchip with your digital litecoin?
This isn't an argument, they are like-kind and gold/silver JUST SO happens to be an exception because of the practical use in physical productions, putting it in a different category than just investment.  They would actually be like-kind if gold were used more in industrial production or silver were used more as an investment.  Bitcoin and litecoin have all the same characteristics both investment and industrial, we aren't comparing apples and oranges here, these are red apples and fiji apples.

Isn't it just trade though, since usd is not involved?

I did, they didn't.  They were very vague.  LibertyX has 1000 Bitcoin ATMs across America, but we don't have an ATM, we take in the cash and issue a receipt.  Their answer was that it is like selling anything.  I asked them about sales tax, they had no answer, I ask them about money laundering, they had no answer.

I agree with everything you said.

If China has 51%, they don't need to kill their own way of making money, they could just fork BTC to whatever they want, correct?  That's the danger of a 51% attack.
I understand your point, but Richies, will do what it takes to retain control.  The whole idea of BTC was to be central proof.  
What I found personally, is I moved my rigs to other coins, mined them, then purchased BTC.  That's anecdotal of course, but it happens.  By me leaving that mining process, it centralized.  I hope you're right.
