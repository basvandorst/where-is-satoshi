My flag raised as well on that statement, but I let it be. I'm so tired of the spam argument. I'm using this damn cryptocurrency every day (especially for receiving payments) and I know how it is to wait 10 hours for a confirmation, or even to see them go back unconfirmed from the mempool, or to have someone give up on a payment simply because "he heard bad stuff about Bitcoin". By not permitting talk of a hard fork, has managed to hard fork the community. We see people from laugh of the subscribers of and the reverse, as if... blah... w/e...

Good guide. I'm posting it on Facebook &amp; hopefully I'll be the creator of a few more Bitcoiners.
