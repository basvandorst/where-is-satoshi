So far the govt of Canada recognizes crypto investments as gambling thus I don't pay taxes on gains. Now they want me to pay my taxes in crypto? Wtf?

You're not wrong, but heat can help as different strains are better grown in certain temps and humidity.

LoL central banker thinks CryptoC is a fraud but can't take a step back and realise central banking system is a fraud. CryptoC threatens central banks, no shit this guy is going to shill against it.

Banking on Bitcoin on Netflix is something I hope everyone in that room watched. There are many documentaries but that one is available on a mainstream platform and does a decent job of covering the history of it imo

I'm from Toronto Canada. All I can say is that the BTC/ETH/LTC machines here are a scam. The prices aren't updated as I saw one machine in early Jan, as the prices were falling, say 1 BTC was $17k CAD while Coinbase and Quadriga we're saying it was $13k CAD.
Huge difference in my opinion, not sure about around the world but I actually ended up stopping someone from using them.
Unless all you have is cash and want to preserve anonymity, I would suggest stay away from em.

Hollywood is not getting into BTC. They are jumping on what they think is a "trend" in order to promote their product.
