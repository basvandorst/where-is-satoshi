Why not? My first purchase of cryptocurrencies was on september and i bought 10$ worth of BTC, LTC and ethereum and instantly i generated one paper wallet for each one. I was (and still am) a noob but I never trust anything in internet (I delate the credit card from amazon after a buy and I write it in again each time I want to buy something new). We just have to tell people that blockchain tecnology is secure, meanwhile exchangers can be hacked.

Right, maybe they just don't show it to me, but i trust amazon to do the right things. I trust Gdax to do the right things too, but man, everybody can get hacked. A burglar can enter my house too and steal the paper wallets but if that happeen would be only my fault.

Against government: bitcoin (or cryptocurrencies/internet in general (with net neutrality)), against hackers: physical objects (paper wallet in my case), and against a guy breaking into my house: a rottweiler.
I think i'm doing it the right way. Now just have to care that my mom doesn't think that those papers with characters on it are sheet papers and think she can throw it to the fire.

I don't know, i think (from my noob point of view) that if they have my card number and verification code saved and they get hacked, the hackers can steal it.
Am I wrong? I don't know :S

No problem bro, think it like this: Bitcoin have no nation, so country is not important!! Best luck with the survey.
