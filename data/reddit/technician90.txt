From a strict legal perspective you should include it
Realistically due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin and the difficulty in calculating its worth I would say that it's safe to leave it out of your taxes until you convert it back into CDN.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:03:54
seems to think that's a viable tactic.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:49:16
this is bad... very very bad, I have 80BTC stuck on that site
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:27:47
I don't know why, probably because it seems a lot better 64 million in liabilities rather than and half a billion in liabilities. He probably would not have gotten the bankruptcy protection that he did with the actual figues. He claims that it was because he plans to pay people the bitcoin back, but didn't elaborate on how. 
As for how he did no include the bit coins debt into the figure, my guess is that he's banking on the novelty of bitcoin to allow him to skate by undetected.

You were right, just needed a refresh

Its impossible to say.
I have 60 BTC on gox right now, and it kills me that I might lose them.
However there are some good reasons that they may just be incompetent and not evil.
First of all, communication when there is a problem has never been something they did.
They use a proprietary close source bitcoin client to do withdrawals, which makes a bug more likely. 
We know the identity of the owner of MtGox and if he was to run we would be able to pursue legal action against him.
If it was a scam it is more likely that they will just disappear one day without explanation rather then spend weeks stringing people along.

Probably referring to when MT4 fucked up and people were unable to close their positions. It screwed over a lot of people and there was no attempt to roll back or refund any of the individuals.
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:50:29
I like the idea, but I can't withdraw. it says my address is invalid
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:30:13
I definitly agree that they are on the decline and will eventually die. I was able to get 50 BTC out of gox and am now happily on bitfinex. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:36:24
Does this mean anything though?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:47:45
I should have said that, yeah, everything was on Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:52:25
I'm now on Bitfinex and loving it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:19:20
There's probably going to be a movie on this in a couple of years. Think, "Wolf of wall street" meets "the social network" Except less cocaine and more desert coffee drinks. 
You should write it.

CNN found the executive director of bitcoin the other day, just go ask him.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:55:17
Its not, I think he's referring to the fact that no one knows anything about the owners of the site. So they could technically close up shop at any point and take everything with them with no consequence. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:13:53
Does this apply since MtGox did not include the bitcoins in the debt count?
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:16:57
Unfortunately it's still readings as invalid.
I'm sure you guys will have it fixed soon.
I'm player_182 and I have attempted to withdraw to 
and 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:58:39
At this point I would take it and call it a victory
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:06:24
I'm with you on this, I'm just telling you that it's not included in the figure they provided.
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:31:18
Not really in the same league. I'm confused over what you're asking.
Which do you prefer? Macaroni or baseball cleats? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:51:47
As someone who lost quite a bit in gox, I love your optimism.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:49:55
I have received my first transaction back (6.8) btc.
I think it takes 7 days or so before the transaction "times out"
I have about 60BTC in bad transactions spanning from 1-6 days and that is the only one returned so far.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:21:46
It hurt, honestly I felt gutted for a while, still do when I think about it.
I was an early investor and thankfully a good portion of my bitcoins are in other safer locations and I am in the black by a wide margin.
It just seemed so unlikely that MtGox would go down, they had been around so long and were a big name in the industry despite their issues. They had similar problems in the past and had always come though. It just seemed like this was another one of those situations.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:08:42
Yeah, I just turned my 250 LTC into BTC
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:06
Its not disabled, i just withdrew at 11am today, it's just slow right now. Especially if you didn't pay the transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:00:20
My guess is that he puts a buy order or multiple distributed buy orders and is mostly selling to himself. Then other people panic sell and fill his other buy orders allowing him to pick up some relatively cheap Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:20:20
Last Monday they said something would be shipped this Saturday.
No update since then I don't think.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:44:29
Look, there is over 3 minutes of lag.
The recovery you're seeing is people from 3 minutes ago setting market buy orders trying to hop on the current upswing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:34:03
perfect, thank you
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:36:09
Let us know when you buy so we can all sell
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:39:43
what did you get out at?
if you don't mind me asking
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:00:07
yeah, but youbit it much easier to say, and the μ looks a lot like a 'u'. Also bits already exist in computer talk, so better not to confuse the masses
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:57:07
you can do a cash deposit at BMO or Scotia and have it credited to an account on CaVirtex.com
Also LibertyBit.com allows you to do cash deposits at scotiabank.
I would recommend Libertybit for a small amount of cash, because they charge less fees but if your planning on buying more than a couple bitcoins, go over to CaVirtex because they have more depth.
Also post your address here and I'll send you enough for coffee at tims.

I'm no expert either but basically the idea of the Martingale betting system is that every time you lose you double the input so that when you win next you cover your losses. 
The idea being that the chances of you losing 10 times in a row is very low.
Personally I could not imagine losing this amount of BTC all at once.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:40:10
you can also invest in just-dice.com and receive a portion of the profit the site makes.
Just look under the "invest" tab and see if that appeals to you

And how many Stanley Nickles will that get me?

Last post said possibly shipping on next friday-ish, but given their record I'm not holding my breath.
I made my pre-order back in January, so I'm probably not going to see it for a while anyway.
Really kicking myself for choosing BFL over Avalon
At least they have one machine out, so something exists. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:43:46
I much prefer 
cBTC = *"see-bit"*
mBTC = *"em-bit"*
µBTC = *"you-bit"*
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:28:14
yeah, but the 3% fees aren't
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:13:23
I always imagine the people who post these things being incredibly smug
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:27:45
I think it's MtGox testing the new whatever they did.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:23:51
Do your research for CaVirtex, it may be better to do an international transfer to MtGox.
Virtex charges 3% fee, so if your investing a large amount it may be better to have the bank do the exchange rate and then pay the 0.6% fee at MtGox.
Also an International wire transfer doesn't require verification for amounts under $10 000

So, seriously asking here, how does a site mitigate a DDoS? Just wait for it to be over, or are there defensive measures they can take?
