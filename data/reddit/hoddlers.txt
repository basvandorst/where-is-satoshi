Oh :(. so you quit crypto world?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:13:59
any link? I am from EU as well
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:47:37
Bitconnect is the culprit
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:22:44
can you elaborate? what bigger picture?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:41
So what level are you going to buy?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:45:58
I think its going to jump back again. Remember people are going to get bonus in Feb/March...so it could be the strategy for big whales so that they can buy cheap. I think this is a good opportunity for someone to buy at cheap. My 2 cents.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:25
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:56:37
I like your rational point of view. What do you think should the right price to buy ?
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:09:23
Why you dont "think"

Would anyone be interested to buy cryptonumberplates.com
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:44:37
It will easily go 70%

There's much better things to do in life then to create a treasure hunt. Donate to charities if you have some extra btc...or help someone who is in need. Or pay someone's college fees or pay someone's hospital bills.

Can anyone tell at what point is the next buy order from bears? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:39:56
You have Roger in the recommended video too. Keep him away...Satoshi and Vitalik (both are good) we need some female to compete with this guys so why not have a female version Satoshi and vitalik . jokes apart, congratulations and wish to see part 2 of the post and would love to welcome youngest member to this reddit ;)

I just have a feeling that tether is going to take us all down!!!! Not sure how long tether is going to keep doing this....
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:35:54
Kudos to you Man for investigating this!!! This is hard work.
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:54:51
I agree. If we see bottom then its going to be because of Tether. Its a white elephant now.
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:24:46
I am one of the hoddlers!
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:34:30
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:29:56
I will be the first one to buy at $2500
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:43:26
Whatever goes up, will always come down one day. There is a gravitational force isn't it. Question is when it comes down and why it comes down. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:51:58
Cryptonumberplates.com: just got an idea...its better to start a company with crypto specific car number plates. May be auction it as well. This domain will be best fit for this. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:53:50
True :). 
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:55:10
Did anyone ever email pine from the website? Did he/she reply ever? From the website it says use contact form but there is no* email address mentioned. Anyone any ideas on how to contact pine?
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:27:13
 this got shut down bcuz they started working on bitcoin. (My 2 cents)
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:16:46
Yeah I can understand. Sorry there was a typo in my comment...I meant the email address is no more mentioned. I can imagine the amount of begging they must have gone through but it was a good initiative. I am very curious to know about that person on his thoughts and how Pine mind works bcuz donating any form of money requires a big heart and I am very inspired by pine. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:01:28
I feel less stress to hodl bcuz I am hoddler ;). I am in it for the technology, not for lambo 
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:14:12
I am very interested to know the following?
1. What triggered you to donate such a massive amount?
2. What do you think about Money? Does money brings you any happiness? Are you minimalist?
3. Have you faced extreme sadness in your life? If yes, did that trigger you to do philanthropy?
4. Do you have a purpose in life? If yes, what is it?
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:48:51
They are the same people who supports coca-cola...so just ignore them!!!
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:19:15
How about we ban you because you are telling moderators on what to do and trying to stop people from expressing (in other words: not allowing freedom of speech)
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:22:56
Its all bull ****. Nobody knows what will happen. Just wild imagination

If its your child or your acquaintance friend then check out Cancer Car T therapy. 
If you have nothing to do with cancer then you are a big retard....STFU. BS. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:55:52
Why not McLaren ;)
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:15:55
Yes is the simple answer. SCAM
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:47:46
Congratulations! Well done
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:13:11
Seems scam!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:37:17
After 5 years we will see similar post talking abt selling BTC at $20,000 !
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:33:20
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:20:41
But its not a https link. Seems phishing website...happy to be wrong though
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:11:30
Dude bitcoin future ended thats why price went down. Its all manipulated by whales.....just wait and watch when prices go back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:33:48
What technology did you use to develop this website?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:44:23
But I do feel the. Split like it works for stocks is not actually working in the same way for crypto....
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:50:47
Nd u need to learn to talk before u say someone dumb. Stop being rude!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:08:34
Is there any way we can see buy orders?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:57:40
Whats the next point to buy BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:15:43
I think Bitcoin price increased because people are buying more to get free 2X. Even though I support bitcoin and other digital currencies but I feel we are in bubble with such "free" stuff. I want to see real application of bitcoin where people actually buy stuff using bitcoin (For example, if Amazon starts accepting bitcoin: I think then the price of $7000 justifies it) but for now we are just in speculative bubble. Be wise, take your profits at regular interval.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:51:36
Did you make it or outsourced it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:18:40
I agree it will go $3000 in next 3 months. I will be very happy if i am wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:52:25
Just bull ****. If it was so easy to predict then we would all had been billionaire. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:50:18
Is he on reddit?
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:08:42
thanks. will watch
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:02:48
bull run it is!
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:16:42
The sellers can post an advert and accept cryptocurrency. The buyers can contact the seller from the advert and then they they can pay using any wallet to buyers address. This website will just be an classified advert website and it will all be moderated. No illegal activities. I want to change people's perception that bitcoin and other crypto-currencies do have lots of purpose apart from been used for illegal activities. My vision is to change people's notion about digital currencies. I look forward to hear your opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:17:34
Thanks for the motivation :). In the meantime, if you have any ideas then let me know. I am still in the process of listing down different features that I could provide. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:26:55
its still work in progress. I just created a page 30 minutes back...My apologies to disappoint you. I am proof-reading it. What spelling mistake have you spotted? Its fine, if you don't want to donate but I will be thankful if you can atleast share your thoughts and ideas about this. I want to know your opinion...
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:40:43
Market will decide!
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:51:58
Thank you for your time guys. I will delete my post...looks like my idea is a crap. Will think something else ....and create a proof of concept and then ask for some support. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:13:19
I also intend to have a blogs linked to the website that will educate people on cryptocurrency and explain them what do they need to do to buy bitcoin or any other currency. You will not find that in craiglist. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:48:50
Why will u hold until 2020? I have seen many people saying same. Do u think after 2020 price will decrease drastically?
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:30:26
Bull trap
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:07:01
Any ideas for cheap webhosting? If anyone can share there experience, will be thankful.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:00:55
I believe, No is the answer unfortunately. Fees tend to be high usually. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:37:01
You are very right, its the same. There is no difference. At the moment, I haven't spotted many people using craiglist where they specify they want to sell there used item for bitcoin or etherium. I think there is an opportunity for such website currently. I have a vision in my head which will really differentiate it from craiglist (For example integration of wallets, i.e coinbase and many other features) but its just an idea for now.
The reason I thought about this is because many people think bitcoin and other currencies are just for illegal activity. I think i will be successful if someone sells a used car using crypto from my website. :) Though this website is just a dream for now. Thanks for your comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:26:26
So if u believe price will increase then why sell? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:21:35
Appreciate your comment. Thanks for your thought. I  will think about it.
