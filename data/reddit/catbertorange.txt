Me too, it is very user friendly, secure., and reliable! Not to mentions the team behind it is top notch.

Airbitz is actually my preferred wallet now and I used to use electrum too. Seeing as I am processing more and more transactions, their exporting and transaction labeling has saved me so much headache. Not to mention the whole thing looks sleek as hell too.

I really like the security features that are inherent in the wallet. Looking forward to using it later this summer!

Excellent! Now everyone can see the top notch back-end to the secure, private, and sleek wallet I have grown so fond of.

(takes tinfoil hat off) There now you should be able to hear me. I am weary of the ever watchful eye of the federal government too., Luckily, Airbitz encrypts all of your transaction data and meta data right on your device before transmitting  it over though their p2p servers. Not even a federal subpoena can do anything, because Airbitz does not even know the encryption keys either. The whole thing is built using the more secure lib bitcoin library.

*edit: really though, some people don't like competition it seems : /

I have to say that I have used many wallets. All have their individual ups and downs. However, a product is only as good as the team behind it. Having seen them at many conferences, I know that my best interests are being taken into consideration. When my finances are concerned , I am happy to know they are kept private and secure.
