Hi, you seem to know things, at least more than me.
I still have some BTC on exchange, I can move some now to a wallet where I control private keys. Shall I do it if I want to get BCC from these BTC or is it too late for that?
Edit: actually I ~~can't~~ can withdraw from the exchange, it's ~~disabled~~ enabled again.

If I understand correctly, it seems that Poloniex -if the post is not outdated- should provide both coins in the case of BCC? (since it's a coin with replay protection)

My english is not the best so I'm not sure if I understood everything I've read correctly. So, correct me if I'm wrong but, here are the informations I gathered so far:
During hard fork:
* Having BTC on an exchange platform is risky because we are not guaranteed to get the BTC and the BTU, we may only get 1 of those currency depending on the platform policy
* Having BTC on a wallet where we don't control private key may lead to the same result as above in case it's not protected against replay attack
* Having BTC on a wallet where we control private key is safe, we only have to wait untill the hard fork is completed and we get both side of the currency
Also, when reading random articles, it looks like there will only be 1 clone of the BTC (and that will be BTU), but when I read this  I feel like BTC is going to be cloned X amount of times.
I thought that August 1st was the day to survive and after that, we just had to wait untill everything stabilized and we would be fine. I'm not sure anymore.
