Hey mate,
Ya know, I've heard of those rumors about "PayPal" asking us to remove Bitcoin. I run the business, and have no idea how this entered the rumor mill, because it couldn't be farther from the truth, but I'd love to know how this got started haha :)
But you are right, we did support Bitcoin back in 2012. We (very) quietly released it onto our platform, and immediately saw a lot of traction take place especially on the exchange front. We would accept Bitcoins directly as a payment method, and then sell them at a discounted price to receive USD. The system worked very well. 
Then FinCEN released their guidance on the subject in March 2012. This was seen as a risk for us because we were essentially now dealing in an open loop system which exposed us (we do not have MSB licensing, and to remain compliant, we would have likely had to pursue this). Because of the uncertainty of Bitcoin at that time, we did not want to assume any risk to the main business model and therefore quietly shut things down, until such a time we could vet the opportunity, discover how we could do so within the bounds of compliance and regulatory requirements, etc. etc. In the end, we couldn't pursue the old system, because then we would be classified as an open-loop currency exchange, but we felt really determined to support the technology anyway. Coin.co has been a great partner since they work with regulators directly, they have their own AML/KYC systems, and they have excellent banking to support their model, and to date the technology has proven very efficient.
