I am more then happy to criticize or call out people or companies for **proven or verified** malicious acts against our community - but /ydtm you are way off base and crazy here.   
I know for a fact that the Blockstream founders and developers have more the $10m USD dollars invested in bitcoin - and are one of the few companies investing in the space - I disagree with /nullc and his fellow Blockstreamers on some issues but your conspiracy theories and hate filled rhetoric has done nothing to help the ecosystem - simply rob us of the most scarce resource we have :  which are qualified devs willing to submit code in spite of the attacks on them.

Please stop lying - I hate how centralized bitcoin core development has become.  I think Blockstream has too much influence on core development.  But lets be honest about the how &amp; the why : other companies have willfully built businesses based on the volunteer contributions of a few and failed to contribute back.    Please show me how much other companies involved in bitcoin have contributed or participated in core development?
I think Blockstream is wrong on many fronts - but atleast they show up.  If another company is willing to check in code at the frequency they do or contribute a the same level I would be their biggest fan: for now I can only be an obstructionist who doesn't like the choices in front of me - I have to chose between /mikehearn who is a proven liar working for R3 and major banks' while hiding his affiliation. fro the community  /gavin who hasn't contributed code or helped bitcoin for almost a year or Blockstream folks who I cant trust because I just dont know - they don't answer questions about their biz model, they dont explain how they can spend so much money on core dev without having alternate motives.
