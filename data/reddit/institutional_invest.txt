Capitulation is still a long way down. It's coming.

It's going down 90%

What adoption are you talking about? You can't spend it on anything because of the fees. The number of top 500 e-commerce merchants accepting bitcoin went *down* from five to three:

There is a limited amount of gold and a limited amount of precious metals. There is an unlimited amount of alt-coins.

Exactly, we've had the biggest bull run yet, I expect the biggest crash yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:25:34
No, they're gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:30:55
Charlie Lite cashed out 100% at the very top. We're going down 90+%.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:32:14
It's going to drop 90% from here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:51
You got that right. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:36:00
Bitcoin is on the way out. Its market share keeps dropping. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:27
Good strategy. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:41:41
Ok. Username checks out. Carry on. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:03:12
Yep. Strap it for the ride down. It's gonna be huuuuuuge!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:44:43
We're in the biggest dip since 2013 and a long way down to go still.

Why are you anchoring your life savings to dollars? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:24:06
How does people buying bitcoin lose banks money? When you buy bitcoins for $100, that $100 goes to the seller. What does the seller do with it? Puts it in a bank. The banks don't lose anything, they still have the $100.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:11:54
How can you assume he's a good guy? You have no idea. Even if he was a good guy, how can you think having one person in control of 6% (or whatever it is) of a currency is a good idea? It's a terrible idea and people won't adopt it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:45:57
Dude this begging is pathetic.

It has a long way down to go. 50% drops are very common and happen every year. That's $5k from here. It could go to $1k or lower.

Yeah right. We're in a 2-3 year bear market now. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:21
How could anyone not expect this? When you have your Uber driver and barber taking out loans to buy bitcoin you know it's going to crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:28:33
It's a pyramid scheme. Where the fuck does a lambo come from do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:27:32
People openly admit they're in this to get rich. For one person to get rich someone else has to get poorer. The poor people would be the ones to get in last. That's a ponzi.

As I said - you don't know who's behind the project, could be the fed, NSA, North Korea, a psychopathic lone wolf, you have NO idea. Are you comfortable with that unknown person owning 12% of a one world currency? It could end really badly. Would you want North Korea to be the next superpower? The average Joe does not understand how bitcoin works and never will. What he'll understand is the *massively* unequal distribution. When someone trustworthy comes with a coin that's fairly distributed guess which one Joe is going to use? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:22:12
I have read the source code. What's your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:46
Good luck catching a falling knife.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:41
More sellers than buyers. People are cashing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:24:13
I can see it easily dropping to $2k. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:40
You're going to lose money. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:56:11
Look at the historical price chart from 2010 on. We just had a 50x bull run. There was a 90-95% crash after every bull run like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:42:33
And meanwhile we should be trusting something created by an unknown shadowy figure with possibly ulterior motives who premined 12% of all coins? The average Joe on the street is going to trust Apple Coin or US Coin that has fair initial distribution instead of a pyramid scheme with the most unequal wealth distribution ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:47:08
Doesn't help the people who bought at 19.5k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:43:43
We're entering a multi-year bear market.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:59:09
Cut your loss. No sense riding it all the way down.

Dude, the futures are cash settled, not physical. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:35:50
It may not fully go away but it could become irrelevant like Aurora Coin and the hundreds of other coins which are for all purposes dead. Even the dark markets don't put a floor on the price - there are better coins with better tech and privacy out there. The price has gone up because of hype on TV and clueless people piling in. It could just as easily burst when people pile out all at once. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:57:15
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:06:20
You just described a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:20:18
There's a whole lot more selling coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:10:28
If you think this can't all collapse you are delusional. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:37:29
I see the bottom at 2k. Just wait and see. It's going to be a bloodbath. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:01:19
He's sold a bunch and gotten rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:43:08
It will drop lower than most people think. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:53:28
Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:50:34
We're entering a multi year bear market. You bought at the top I'm afraid to say. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 02:59:47
You mean, like, Buy-with-one-click, which has been around since the last century, but with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:49:56
No. They are creating an internal trading desk to pump and dump shitcoins. They'll be on the other side of your trade. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:00:11
Coinbase will try to hit your closed account, and your bank will probably blacklist you. Other banks too. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:08:59
It will take months. It will be a slow painful train wreck.

They got four detectives working on the case. They got us working in shifts!

Madoff didn't guarantee any return on investment, yet he ran a Ponzi.
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:49:00
That's assuming the 160BTC gets fully withdrawn and replenished every year. Their take could be much smaller if the money just keeps getting tipped forward within the system.

The oil barons did not have their fingers on the launch button to crash the economy. If bitcoin takes off as people on this sub hope, then Satoshi has huge power with the nuclear launch codes in his sole control. Let's not bury our heads in the sand here and pretend this is not a huge issue. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:57:01
Didn't Bitinstant have a thing where you could buy bitcoin at a 7-11? No need for ATMs, there is already plenty of existing infrastructure for taking cash. If you can buy an anonymous Visa gift card at a 7-11, why can't we buy a bitcoin card there? 
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:54:11

What planet do you live on? I have never provided ID when buying a prepaid visa card.

If he doesn't have the keys he needs to come forward and say so. If he does, he should destroy the coins. This, and only this, can put the issue to rest. Otherwise this issue will hang over bitcoin and seriously stunt adoption.

Dude chill, 7% is nothing. People here have lost 65% this year.

I am not sure why you replied to my post with this non-sequitur. Which part is factually incorrect?
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:29:16
Bitcoin has lost more value this year than the ruble. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:50:12
Why? You can get a $500 Visa card for $5, that's 1%. I don't know, maybe Visa subsidises it because they get 2% in interchange fees, so let's call it a 2% fee. Nowhere near what ATMs or WU charge. 
To add to this, with ATMs you need to pay rent, maintenance, and someone to empty/supply cash which is all expensive and reportedly about 75% of revenues. The marginal cost of taking cash at an existing cash register is minimal, maybe even negative, when accounting for the increased shopper traffic at the register.

QR codes are still a thing? Really?

A promise of later return is not a necessary part of a Ponzi. Just the expectation of later return; no guarantee or promised needed. Therefore, the argument that bitcoin does not pretend to be an investment or doesn't promise/guarantee a return, thus is not a Ponzi, is a [strawman]( argument. 
If enough people EXPECTED bitcoin to provide a return, it could very well be a Ponzi. I'm not saying bitcoin IS a Ponzi, just saying - let's try to avoid using false logic.

Transparency here is absolutely needed. Since Satoshi holds 1MM coins, he has outsize influence over the BTC price - he could singlehandedly crash the price if he wanted to. We should absolutely demand to know who Sathoshi is and demand to know his true intentions. If you start something like Bitcoin you absolutely consent to the necessary scrutiny.
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:08:02
Bitcoin is not a real currency?

No. They won't collect double VAT in Australia. That's it! They won't pay taxes in the UK. Since their office remains in Melbourne, they will continue to pay corporate taxes in Australia as before. Saying they are "leaving Australia" is just false.

This makes no sense. We already have time systems which don't use leap seconds. If you don't like leap seconds, feel free to use GPS time or the International Atomic Time. Anyone else who's a half-decent programmer can deal with leap seconds and move on.

Neither is it qualified with what the bitcoin user experience could potentially be in a hundred years. That's not what was asked. Stop moving the goalposts!


You're sure  intent on making it one.


That's the whole point! OP asked for negative aspects of bitcoin. I have stated some, and you seem intent on derailing the discussion. Claiming with a straight face that bitcoin being a smaller market cap currency somehow compensates for it's negative aspects and expecting to be taken seriously would necessitate the reader being as stupid as the writer. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:39:16
I am comparing the bitcoin user experience to the dollar user experience. 
Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed. If a robber steals your bitcoin wallet, you have no recourse. If you accidentally send bitcoin to the wrong address, you have no recourse. Not the case with dollars. If your bank gets robbed, the transaction will be reversed and you will be made whole. If you accidentally send a check to the wrong person, you can put a stop pay on it and be made whole.
Which part of this don't you understand?
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:38:14
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:06:02
What if you accidentally send bitcoin to the wrong address? Happens to people on this sub all the time.
@_date: 2015-11-29 00:56:00
Yes, same as what OP meant. Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed. If a robber steals your bitcoin wallet, you have no recourse. If you accidentally send bitcoin to the wrong address, you have no recourse. Not the case with dollars. If your bank gets robbed, the transaction will be reversed and you will be made whole. If you accidentally send a check to the wrong person, you can put a stop pay on it and be made whole. Which part of this don't you understand?

@_date: 2015-11-29 00:45:50
False. The government can, and will, print money. If your bank gets robbed, the government will print new money to cover your loss. With bitcoin - you are shit out of luck.

You are digging yourself into a hole. As you know, we are comparing the user experience of bitcoin to the user experience of dollars. This is what OP was pointing out as a failing of bitcoin. Again:
Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed. If a robber steals your bitcoin wallet, you have no recourse. If you accidentally send bitcoin to the wrong address, you have no recourse. Not the case with dollars. If your bank gets robbed, the transaction will be reversed and you will be made whole. If you accidentally send a check to the wrong person, you can put a stop pay on it and be made whole. 
Which part of this don't you understand?
